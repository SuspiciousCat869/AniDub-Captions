WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.854
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:38.024
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:42.695
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.798
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.367
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.070
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:55.208
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.512
[NARRATOR] The first stop
on Luffy's journey is

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:02.282
Fishman Island, thousands
of feet below sea level,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.151
where his crew becomes
involved in a civil war.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:07.487
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.759
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.495
The enemy captures
Zoro, Usopp, and Brook,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.564
trapping them at
the Ryugu Palace

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.333
while the other Straw Hats
meet in the Sea Forest.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.604
[LUFFY] Get outta my way.
I gotta go save my friends!

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.906
And when I'm done,
I'm kicking Hordy's ass!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.909
I told you not to
get involved with him!

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.547
[LUFFY] "Something Has
Happened to Hordy!

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.150
The True Power
of the Evil Drug!"

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.120
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE AA]
It's time to show

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.855
the island who's boss!

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:43.890
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE BB]
That's right!

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.858
All we gotta do
is kill the king.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:49.195
Once that's done, the royal
army'll surrender fast!

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.632
And if Neptune's dead, Fishman
Island's gonna need a new ruler!

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:55.168
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B chuckles]
I can't wait!

00:03:56.703 --> 00:04:01.708
[chuckling]

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.149
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, at Candy Factory Town

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.185
in the center of the island.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.460
Boss Daruma? Hey, you okay?

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.629
He's chewing right through
the factory walls!

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.697
Yeah, like it was nothing!

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:38.011
[FISHMEN yelling]

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:42.315
My fangs itch for more! [laughs]

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.383
Huh?

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.552
What's this crap?

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.755
I don't want some trendy
cappuccino latte thing

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.490
or fancy sponge cake
when I'm hungry!

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:52.058
That junk's not real food!

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.960
What in the hell do I look like?

00:04:53.993 --> 00:04:56.496
I-I'm sorry, Boss!
I'll get something else!

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.964
That's good,
because you're starting

00:04:57.997 --> 00:04:59.532
to look pretty tasty yourself!

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:03.670
For a snack, I like fish bones
and I like 'em big! Now go!

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.407
Uh, sure thing!
Big fish bones, I got it!

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.743
Nevermind. I'm gonna go whet
my appetite on some soldiers

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.112
and maybe the royal family, too!

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:16.582
I guess I'll see the rest of
you bums at Conchcorde Plaza!

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.552
Don't you dare be late!
We all have to be there!

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.454
What should we do
about the citizens?

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.689
Come on.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:25.892
Did you morons pay attention
to a word Captain Hordy said?

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:29.028
He told us, "No more
stepping on her picture."

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.631
[laughs] Leave 'em
alone for now!

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:34.434
Those losers'll get what's
coming to them soon enough!

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.002
[DARUMA laughs]

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:46.512
[FISHMEN murmuring]

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:49.882
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:52.385
How are we supposed to
stand up to these guys?

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.821
Including Hordy,
the New Fishman Pirates have

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:59.859
four shark Fishmen as officers,
and a giant squid Fishman.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.829
Not to mention their bodyguard
is a blue-ringed octopus merman

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.898
known as the best swordsman
on the entire island!

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:11.037
I think the Neptune brothers are
the only hope we've got left.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.674
Then all we can do
is keep the faith.

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.377
Pu-wink.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.347
[NARRATOR] At Waterwheel Town
in the island's northern region.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.448
[FISHMAN E]
Did you hear?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.350
The Princes are making their
way to Conchcorde Plaza!

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.352
[FISHMAN F]
This country's in such a mess!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.388
Tell me about it.
All we wanted to do

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.556
was improve our relationship
with the humans.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.924
There's no reason to
threaten everyone

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.060
with death like
some kind of madman!

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:37.263
And on top of those threats,
they wanna execute the king.

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.499
Maybe Hordy will be willing
to bargain with us.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.602
After all, we've got
his men held hostage.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:44.237
Held hostage?

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:47.573
Your plan isn't going to work.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.943
Boss Hordy would rather you
cut us downsun than negotiate.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.679
He's more ruthless than
the other Fishman Pirates.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.315
It's why he looks
downsun on the rest of us.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.652
This can't be good.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.320
Ever since the
princes defeated him,

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.190
Officer Dosun's power level
has dropped to "downsun."

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.958
Now he's just weak and gloomy.

00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:08.060
[FISHMAN PIRATE GG] Lemme
give him an Energy Steroid.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.064
[DOSUN] Thinking about
it just brings me downsun.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:13.599
It's depressing!

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.338
[DOSUN grunts]

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:22.275
Sometimes Hordy
makes me frownsun.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.212
Huh?

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.415
Hordy doesn't like Fishmen who
do business with human pirates.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.553
He'll give them the
bumpsun without mercy.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.188
[FISHWOMAN A]
"Bumpsun"?

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:37.390
[DOSUN] All those Fishmen
who donated their blood

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:39.725
to help out wounded humans--

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.062
he gave them the old whumpsun
in the dark of night.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.731
[FISHMAN H]
"Whumpsun"?

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:49.101
Hordy believes that human
blood is naturally tainted,

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.872
and whenever we receive their
blood or offer them our own,

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:56.209
we dosun our pure
blood a disservice!

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.377
He's back to saying "dosun" now!

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.313
[DOSUN]
Any Fishman who supports humans

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:03.316
is a traitor and
needs to be punished!

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:07.920
Our people will never be able
to advance with them in our way!

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.256
All right, that's enough!

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:13.693
I'm gonna go whamsun on you!

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.728
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
He's higher than "dosun"!

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:18.397
[FISHMAN AA]
The chains are shattered!

00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.032
You bastard!

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:23.002
[DOSUN yells]

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.638
[AMMO KNIGHTS scream]

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.473
[FISHMAN I] He knocked
them out with one swing!

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:31.978
Fukaboshi! I'll get
you back with a slamsun!

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.045
[FISHMEN shouting]

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:38.551
Then I'll smash your face
with a big fat boomsun!

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:41.087
[DOSUN yelling]

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.925
[FISHMEN shouting]

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.228
My enemies will face doomsun!

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:53.566
Head to the Conchcorde Plaza
for the execution! Let's move!

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:55.635
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.773
[NARRATOR]
At the south part of the island

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.242
in front of the
Fishman Cultural Hall.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.945
[HYOUZOU sighs]

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:09.348
Huh? Who are you callin' drunk?
Oh, yeah, that's right, it's me.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.217
This isn't funny anymore, Boss!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.353
Pull yourself together! You're
in no shape to fight like that!

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:16.722
I think you worry too much, pal!

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.492
Relax, drinks are on
the house! It's my treat!

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.294
That's not important right now!

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.230
Fukaboshi is leading Neptune's
army into the plaza!

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.932
We have to be ready for them!

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:27.667
Even worse, if things go bad,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.269
Jimbei might even
show up to fight!

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:32.371
This isn't a joke, Boss!

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:37.944
It's no use. He's weak as a sea
cucumber and just as slippery.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:40.613
Huh? Well, I'll be!

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.849
How'd you get your head
spinnin' around like that?

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:46.352
I'm standing still!
How drunk are you?

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:49.488
This is awful. I doubt
Hyouzou can even hold his sword.

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.824
[HYOUZOU]
Pfft, sure I can!

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.859
Get away from him immediately!

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.328
I'm serious!

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:56.862
Hyouzou will slice into anyone

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.631
and everyone when
he's this drunk!

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.166
Make a run for it!

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.602
He'll slice anyone?

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.508
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groan]

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.077
He attacked his own guys?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.312
[HYOUZOU chuckles]

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:14.847
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.652
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES scream]

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.535
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasping]

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:43.242
See? I can fight just
fine. Right, boys?

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.078
[HYOUZOU chuckles]

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.146
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.116
Uh, hey, Hyouzou!
Why don't you go to the plaza?

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:53.653
There you can cut up the royal
family as much as you want! Huh?

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:57.356
[HYOUZOU]
I, uh... no... wh-- Uh...

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.224
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Wha--

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.159
What is that even
supposed to mean?

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.495
[ZEO chuckles]

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.230
[NARRATOR]
At the Marine Shopping Mall

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:06.399
in the east part of the island.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:07.900
[FISHMAN J]
We're former soldiers of Neptune

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:09.035
and proud of it!

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.171
You won't take this country
as long as we're around!

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.407
[FISHMAN J yelling]

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.575
Huh? What? Where'd he go?

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:18.010
[FISHMAN J groaning]

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:20.346
[FISHMEN groaning]

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:21.647
Where is he?

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.351
[FISHMAN N gasps, groans]

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:26.886
[FISHMAN O]
Hold still!

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.621
He disappeared again!

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:30.856
Damn it, did anyone
see where he went?

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:32.958
[FISHMAN P groans]

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:34.427
[FISHMAN O groans]

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.397
[ZEO] You think you pathetic
civilians stand a chance?

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:40.266
You're dumber than I thought.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:42.702
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K] Heh!
Boss Zeo can blend in perfectly

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:45.137
with his surroundings
to camouflage himself.

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:47.273
Just like a chameleon!

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:48.674
He might be on our side,

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.143
but even we have trouble
figuring out where he is!

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:52.912
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K chuckles]

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:54.213
What? This is unfair!

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:56.782
How are we supposed to fight
someone we can't even see?

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.284
[ZEO]
You might as well start begging

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:01.620
for the Neptune Brothers
to bail you out.

00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:03.723
Without them, you're finished.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:04.957
[FISHMAN R yelps]

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.060
[ZEO] Though frankly, don't
expect them to last long either.

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:10.963
Oh, well. Time to
finish you off.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:12.698
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
Whoa! A roach!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.666
Hurry up! Kill it!

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:18.704
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES grunting]

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:30.716
That was weird. All of
a sudden, he stopped talking.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.486
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K]
Did we get it? Is it dead?

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:35.521
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
Yeah. We got it.

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:37.590
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.194
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.431
[ZEO]
You fools have nowhere to run.

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:48.801
It's only a matter of time
before we hunt you all down.

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.070
There's no escaping our wrath!

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.805
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K] He's
talking like nothing happened!

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.274
We just beat him to
a pulp! What class!

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.842
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
No wonder he's called the Noble

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.677
of the Fishman District!

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:01.046
[ZEO]
Prepare for the revolution.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.917
Later on today
at Conchcorde Plaza...

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:11.457
[ZEO] ...the Neptune family will
die, and a new king will rise.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.260
Now, let's head
to the execution!

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.529
[ZEO coughs]

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:19.298
[HORDY groans]

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.434
What's wrong, Captain?
You're not hurt, are you?

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:23.869
Don't worry about it.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.037
You sure?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.707
I'm fine! Just bring me more
pills! As many as we have!

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:32.511
But that could kill you! [gasps]

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:33.512
We want you to get better,

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.481
but taking more pills
is not the way!

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:37.883
You're already way over
the limit, Boss!

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:42.087
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES murmuring]

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.956
Want your head crushed in?

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.859
Then fall back in
line and shut up!

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.828
Captain! There's
no need for this!

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.796
We already have
King Neptune hostage!

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.133
Victory's right in front of us!
Just give your body a rest!

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:57.102
Listen to us! You're
pushing yourself too hard!

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.275
[HORDY grunts]

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:13.285
[HORDY groaning]

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:34.673
Get out of the way, Jimbei!
I don't have time for this!

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.875
I will not!

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:38.611
Fishman problems should
be handled by Fishmen!

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:39.712
There is no reason why

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.181
this should be so difficult
for you to understand!

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:44.850
[LUFFY] Shut up! I don't
give a damn about the beef

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.352
the Fishmen and humans have!

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.888
Especially not when my
friends are in danger!

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.623
[JIMBEI]
I can rescue your friends!

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:53.525
Your interference will
do more harm than good!

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.828
[JIMBEI, LUFFY grunt]

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:59.398
They both wanna help out,
so why are they arguing so much?

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:01.533
Their fighting
isn't doing any good!

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.971
[BOTH grunting]

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:10.576
[FUKABOSHI] How much longer
before we arrive at the plaza?

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.912
[AMMO KNIGHT C]
Less than an hour, sir!

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.780
[AMMO KNIGHT A] Executing
the king at Conchcorde Plaza

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:18.350
feels calculated. Why not
just do it at the palace?

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.754
I think Hordy might be trying
to lure you princes into a trap!

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:24.023
That is no concern to me.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.691
I look forward to this fight.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.227
I will not let them
murder our father!

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.629
And I refuse to let our
citizens' hearts and minds

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:33.098
become closed off after
all we've worked for!

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.367
Jimbei kept Hordy
under his watchful eye,

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.404
and now I see that we should
have taken note of that.

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.172
He's probably the
reason human pirates

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.607
have stopped coming
here as well--

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.776
an issue we should have
investigated sooner.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:47.012
Say, do you think Shirahoshi is
still in the Hard Shell Tower?

00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:48.981
We haven't heard anything
about sis in a while

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:52.117
and it's really starting
to bug me-fa-so-la!

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.819
How did you feel
about the Straw Hats?

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:55.988
'Cause I didn't think
they were bad people.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:58.324
Madam Sharley said that
they'd destroy the country,

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:02.227
but so far, they seem like
the least of our worries.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.263
They have caused
their share of trouble,

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.098
but they may be victims, too.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.768
That's what I think.
Straw Hat's Jimbei's friend,

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.638
and the mermaids didn't
have a problem with them.

00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:15.641
And frankly, their
judgment is rarely wrong.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:17.409
Agreed, but this is not the time

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:19.912
nor the place to
ponder such questions!

00:16:19.945 --> 00:16:22.948
Right. We need
to focus-so-la-ti-do!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.818
[FUKABOSHI] Summon every soldier
that the country has to offer!

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.153
We're going to save
our king at any cost!

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.022
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

At Fishverly Hills

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.793
in the northeast
part of the island.

[SEA BEAR A snarls]

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:40.466
He's too tough!

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.601
Damn it! We shouldn't
be having this much trouble

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.903
fighting against
just one sea monster!

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.606
But then again, it seems
something is amiss.

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.376
[SEA BEAR A snarls]

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.345
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE Q laughs]
Look at these fools.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.948
Serves them right! All right,
Sea King, keep it up!

are makin' him crazy!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE R]
Hey! Calm down, Sea Bear!

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:07.192
That's enough! The soldiers
are barely alive.

00:17:07.226 --> 00:17:08.927
Our job here is done!

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.697
Use this! Sea Kings
don't like fire.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:12.998
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE R]
Stay back!

Uhh...

[IKAROS]
Roar!

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:26.311
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:30.182
[IKAROS]
Roar!

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.383
What the...?

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.719
I don't think his arms are
supposed to bend back like that!

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:35.754
He must be under
some kind of a curse!

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:39.058
You idiot! Put out
that fire right away! Hii!

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:39.992
Hot! Hot! Hot!

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:42.394
Huh? You said
something about fire?

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:44.563
[IKAROS yells]

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:47.099
What are you trying to do,
cook up some smoked squid?

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:48.500
You think we'd eat you?

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.968
Oh, the fire.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.438
You were trying to roast me

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.506
and have me with
a glass of saké. Hii.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.408
When I recover, I'll kill you!

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:58.477
Who'd wanna do that?
You're crazy!

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.412
Oh, sorry, sir.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:02.981
Careful. I heard about
how one of Ikaros's

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.050
best friends was a giant squid.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.319
One day he swam
too close to the sun.

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:10.022
Before you know it,
he was a giant dried squid!

00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:13.092
That's why Ikaros freaks
out when he sees fire.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:17.162
I'm sorry, Daidalos!

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.430
But if he's a Fishman,

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:20.132
he doesn't have anything
to worry about.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.867
[IKAROS]
Daida.

No more fire! Got me? Hii?

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.411
Oh, no!

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:34.613
That Dried Squid
Spear is dangerous!

00:18:34.646 --> 00:18:36.415
It turns back
into a normal squid

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:39.184
by sucking all the fluid
out of anyone it strikes!

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.553
That guy's as good as jerky!

and then this happens?

to Conchcorde Plaza?

to see this, sir!

heading to the Conchcorde Plaza!

not anymore. Look at me!

What good is a king's army

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.553
if it can't even protect
the king it serves?

to this country.

left till the execution!

Is he not with you?

Why isn't he talking
to me directly-hii?

at the cost of your lifespan.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:16.915
You shouldn't have taken
it in the first place.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.051
[HORDY]
Shut up!

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:20.886
Captain Hordy was injured!

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.788
The human pirate
swordsman cut him

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:24.723
and the gash is
too painful to bear!

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:27.192
[IKAROS] Injured?
The Captain got injured?

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:28.694
His body wouldn't stop hurting,

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:32.030
so he kept taking Energy
Steroids to help kill the pain!

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.900
[HORDY gasping]

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.134
Now he's messed up.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:38.637
We told him to stop, but he
wouldn't listen to anyone!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.374
[HORDY groaning]

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:44.610
No, Captain Hordy!

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:49.248
Can't breathe. I can't--

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:52.317
Feel like I'm gonna explode!

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.987
Muhi! It's just as I suspected.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.090
The drug's side effects
are bad enough to kill you.

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:05.597
[HORDY screaming]

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.991
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm?

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:38.130
Whoa, something's wrong.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:46.138
[whimpers]

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.374
[SEA BEAR A whimpering]

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:51.076
What's wrong with
you now, Sea Bear?

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.844
I think he must be afraid!

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:54.212
But all these sea
monsters have been

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:57.649
under Captain Hordy's control
for a really long time now!

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:00.252
I don't know what would
spook him so much.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:07.926
Uh, is that you, Captain?

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.995
You doin' okay there?

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:14.132
But of course.
And why wouldn't I be?

00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:23.608
He's alive,
but something changed.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:29.915
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.918
[chuckles]

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:36.021
Some of Neptune's
soldiers are still alive.

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:39.157
[ALL gasp]

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:40.859
Water Shot!

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.130
[AMMO KNIGHTS scream]

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.336
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:05.951
[cackling]

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.428
[NARRATOR]
Neptune's army is crushed

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.664
by the overwhelming might of
the newly-transformed Hordy.

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:20.899
The people's last hope

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:23.635
lies in the three princes
of the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:24.703
Rushing to the scene,

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:27.072
they quickly battle
Hordy's sea monsters,

00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:29.474
but his crewmates have
a dirty trick up their sleeves

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:32.210
that could turn the
tables once again.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.879
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:36.848
"The Battle is on!
At Conchcorde Plaza!"

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:39.451
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
