WEBVTT

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.005
[NARRATOR] The International
Gourmet Organization

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.090
put on a no-holds-barred race:

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:10.093
The World Martial
Eats Tournament.

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:11.511
Seeking the grand prize,

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:14.597
a taste of the legendary
Carat Sizzled Cattle,

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.892
pirate and gourmet alike eagerly
assembled at the starting line,

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.437
only to find themselves
dropping out of the race

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:23.356
and into a giant ant-lion pit.

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.066
The field was quickly
narrowed down

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.277
to Toriko, Luffy, and Goku,

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.946
who carried on relentlessly
toward the finish line,

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:34.075
despite dangerous beasts
and treacherous terrain.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.536
[ANNOUNCER]
Unbelievable!

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.955
Contestants Goku,
Toriko, and Luffy

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:41.332
all reach the goal
at the same time!

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.585
Well, if they can't settle
it with a footrace,

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.463
I guess we're just gonna have
to make it a fistfight instead!

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.256
Unreal, folks!

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.176
What a slobberknocker,
and it looks like Mister Satan

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.637
wants in on the action, too!

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.015
[NARRATOR] Toriko, Luffy,
and Goku struggled to gain

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.143
the upper hand in an intense
battle for the prize.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.271
Five-fold Spiked Punch!

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.024
Gatling!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.820
[GOKU]
...ha!

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.239
[NARRATOR]
But when the dust settled...

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:18.787
[ANNOUNCER]
Uh! The winner is Mister Satan!

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.206
[laughing]

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.499
Hey, when you're
as tough as I am,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.376
you can win a fight without even
havin' to throw a punch!

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:26.711
[laughing]

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:29.172
[groans]

00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:32.050
Huh? But the meat.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:34.469
How the heck's that even fair?

00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:36.805
[NARRATOR] At that moment,
unbeknownst to them,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:41.142
a mysterious beast was
closing in from the depths.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.023
[GOKU, LUFFY, TORIKO] "History's
Strongest Collaboration

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.818
vs Glutton of the Sea!"

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:56.658
[TRUNKS]
Check it out, Goten.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:58.576
The view here is awesome!

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.453
[GOTEN]
I know, right?

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.372
[CHOPPER] This has gotta be
the best view I've had

00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:04.541
out of anywhere I've ever eaten!

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.502
[RIN]
Same! It's totally impressive.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:08.711
[KRILLIN]
What's taking so long?

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.339
I'm seriously
starving over here.

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.259
[SUNNY] I'm absolutely craving
some Carat Sizzled Cattle!

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.302
[NAMI] It's the stuff
of legends, y'know.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:19.389
The tastiest meat
in the whole world!

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.559
[SETSUNO] All right! Dinner
is ready, ladies and gents!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.019
[KOMATSU] Thanks for your
patience, everybody!

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.982
It's meat!

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:31.067
Food!

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.363
So this is the legendary
Carat Sizzled Cattle steak.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.407
I can almost taste it
through my eyeballs.

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.159
It's a real special
kind of meat,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.786
so you best take your time
and savor it properly.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.121
But there's plenty
to go around,

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.415
so you can have as many
helpings as you want!

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.083
That looks great!

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.418
Hey, slow down!

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.919
First you gotta put
your hands together

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.379
and demonstrate your gratitude.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.964
Oh, yeah, right.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:59.721
I give humble thanks for the
vast bounty this world provides.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.764
Okay, now let's eat!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.017
[ALL]
Let's eat!

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.778
[squeals] It's so good!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.156
The first bite was
exploding with flavor!

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.240
You put the meat in your mouth

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.285
and the juice hits ya
like a tidal wave!

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.370
Man, I can eat this
Carat Sizzled Cattle

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:25.246
right off the bone!

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:28.249
Uh, excuse me!
Can I get some more?

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.628
Wow, I had no idea meat
could even taste like this!

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:32.795
Sure, the meat is nice,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.465
but these bones are said to
be thousands of carats each!

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.716
Ha! Tasty!

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.426
Looks great,
but even the best steak

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.261
isn't super enough for me.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.555
I'll just stick with my Cola.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.309
You're your own kinda
super, huh, pink guy?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.478
What's the matter?
Aren't you gonna try the meat?

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.147
Want some cotton
candy? I'll share!

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.690
Oh, how sweet of you.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:54.651
When I think about the
fact that we live in a world

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:58.321
with such delicious meat to eat,
I can't help getting teary eyed!

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.491
Until I remember I don't have
any eyes or tear ducts.

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:03.034
[BROOK laughs]

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.994
[USOPP] Boy, this stuff
is almost too good!

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.122
[SUNNY] Carat Sizzled Cattle
is absolutely gorgeous!

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.082
[ROSHI]
Darn tootin'!

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.334
Lucky for me I lived
long enough to try it.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.543
[BULMA]
If you wanna keep living,

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.628
you'll eat off your own plate.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.504
[KOMATSU]
Come to think of it,

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.631
does anybody know
where Zoro went?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:20.468
[SANJI] Probably lost
somewhere. It's fine.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.347
No joke, this is some
really tasty meat.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.100
Yeah, Carat Sizzled Cattle
is somethin' really special,

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.019
but more than that, we've got
somethin' really special

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:33.106
that enhances the
flavor of the meat.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.941
Do you see it?

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:41.030
[TORIKO] The greatest
spice is friendship.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.408
The finest meal
tastes even better

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.535
when you're eating it together.

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:48.913
[laughs]

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.624
Pay attention!
I'm imparting wisdom here!

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:52.875
Do what now?

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:54.961
I think he said how
the meat's really good.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.046
Thanks for sharing your
prize, Mister Satan.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.048
Everybody's really enjoying it.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.508
Well, they all fought
their hearts out,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.052
and I figured that deserved
some recognition.

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.972
[SATAN laughs]

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:07.557
But here's the secret.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.058
Friendship is the special sauce

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.893
on the Carat Sizzled
Cattle steak,

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:12.186
'cause the finest meal is better

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:15.565
when you've got some good
friends to eat it with, yeah.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:18.609
So the secret is exactly
what Toriko just said.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:26.701
[ALL chattering]

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.415
[ROBIN] Now, Mansam,
what exactly are you plotting?

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.624
[MANSAM chuckles]

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.294
What were you trying to achieve
by holding this tournament?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.464
You have several powerful
people gathered here,

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:42.216
and I'm guessing that
was the IGO's real goal.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.426
Am I wrong?

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.219
There must be some kind of plan.

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:48.306
Sounds like you guys
figured me out in a hurry.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.640
No use denying it.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.809
The IGO put this whole
shindig together

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.519
as a way to draw out an Akamee.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.146
An Akamee?

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:59.150
You're fishing for monsters
with us as bait?

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.485
[splashing]

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.028
[ALL gasp]

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.321
[RIN]
Where'd that come from?

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:04.447
[ALL gasp]

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:07.283
[BULMA] Seems like a pretty
extravagant fountain.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.870
[ALL gasp]

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.707
[GOKU]
Oh, wow. A fish.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.168
Whoa, back up! That's one
freaky lookin' fish!

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.338
The legendary glutton of
the deep. It's an Akamee.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.591
No way. That party
balloon is an Akamee?

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:24.592
Ak-who-wha?

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:25.760
[TORIKO]
An Akamee.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:28.513
A little fish with an appetite
bigger than the ocean.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.349
It instinctively tries to gobble
up everything it sees.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.934
You say that like
it's dangerous,

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:35.019
but it doesn't look
that way at all.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.771
This little guy's nothin'
to be afraid of.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.940
You let me handle this, folks.

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:42.819
Hey! C'mere, little fella.
That's a nice fish-balloon.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.528
[roars]

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.696
[BOTH scream]

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:47.532
Watch out!

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.326
Gohan, run!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.167
[LUFFY]
Usopp! Are you okay?

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:04.173
Ah! Why did it just get
five times bigger?

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.384
The Akamee can make
its body grow rapidly

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.345
by devouring the life
energy of other creatures.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.389
Bastard fish!

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.600
Flying Knife!

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:20.148
[GOKU]
Gohan!

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:22.358
You okay?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.194
I'm fine, but for some reason

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.238
I can't draw out
any of my power.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.491
That would be the Akamee's
toxin going into effect.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.411
Toxin? So is there an
antidote or something?

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.288
If you catch the Akamee
and bring it back,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.415
I can cook you up an antitoxin.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.625
That's only if you get
the primary ingredients

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:41.252
inside the next half- hour.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.753
Okay, you got it!

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:45.214
So we just have to go
beat up the floating fish?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.841
You got room for one more?

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.842
Toriko.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:50.386
That hungry little guy
is goin' on the menu!

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.930
She said we only had
half an hour to do it.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.640
All right!

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.601
So you gathered these
legendary fighters

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:59.562
in one place for a stupid fish?

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:00.396
[MANSAM chuckles]

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.564
[PICCOLO grunts]

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.274
Hey, we're going, too!

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.026
Yeah!

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:06.819
If we don't deal with
this Akamee here,

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.071
it will eventually wolf
down every living creature

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.531
on the face of the planet,

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.618
but now that those guys
are on it, it'll be fine!

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.953
Right...

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.455
[SANJI]
So find it?

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.831
[SUNNY]
It's not over here.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:19.790
[SANJI]
Why'd the stupid thing

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.542
have to hide in the
forest anyway?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.002
It's a damn fish!

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.171
Right. I'm going to
search over this way.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.131
You can look in that
direction. Good?

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.133
Pound sand, cotton candy hair!

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:30.384
What did you call me?

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:31.469
Did you honestly think

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.846
I was just gonna take orders
from you, you freak?

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.974
Really, now. Calling me a freak
with those eyebrows?

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.976
[roaring]

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:42.271
Close one.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:46.567
[SANJI] Okay. Saves us
havin' to look, at least.

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.569
I'm putting this thing
down right here,

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:49.654
so stay outta my way!

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.864
Don't you tell me what to do!

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.325
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe!

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.579
Go, Hair Net!

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:07.129
Hey, it's you.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.716
Stop your bickering.
Let's go, you two!

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:11.509
[roars]

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.427
[ALL yelling]

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.304
[roaring]

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.306
[SUNNY]
Spatula!

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.643
[SANJI]
Sky Walk!

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.521
Poele a Frire Spectre!

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.982
[PICCOLO yells]

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:27.775
We got him.

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.988
[yells]

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.170
[GOKU]
Could that weird balloon-fish

00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:50.047
know how to hide its energy?

00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:52.049
Man, I hope not.

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:57.513
[BROOK] Ahh, these waterfalls
move something in your heart

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.890
the moment you lay
eyes on 'em, huh?

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.934
I'm asking 'cause I don't
have eyes or a heart.

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.144
[BROOK laughs]

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:04.562
[BROOK]
Nothing, really?

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:06.731
The others went looking
for it in the forest,

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.191
so we should search
the waterfront.

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:12.570
I agree. That way, we can
know if we're goi-- Ah!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.990
Hoo, boy, must've tripped
over my own tarsals, huh?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.618
[BROOK screaming]

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:24.749
--[AKAMEE roaring]
--[BROOK screaming]

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.209
It wasn't that creepy
looking before, was it?

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:30.504
And why's it got wings
all of a sudden?

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:32.089
[COCO]
Poison Sword!

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.090
[yells]

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.842
[BROOK]
Yo-hoo!

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:36.927
Poison Cannon!

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.763
Oh, fudge.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:39.347
[TRUNKS]
Goten!

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:40.598
Let's go!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.644
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Fusion... Ha!

00:10:44.685 --> 00:10:47.772
Super Gotenks is ready
for a fight!

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.106
Say your prayers.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.651
You ruined a perfectly
good steak spread.

00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:53.611
Now I'm feelin' like a fish fry!

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.738
[FRANKY]
Hold on a second!

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.283
I'm gonna be the one to take
out this overgrown guppy!

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:03.371
Whoa. What the heck
is that robot?

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:09.794
[FRANKY]
Iron Pirate General Franky!

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.798
I already know you slap your
opponents with those tentacles

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:16.008
and use 'em to sap
away their energy!

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.052
It's a neat trick,
I'll give ya that.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:23.808
But it'll do you no good against
the invincible General Franky!

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.351
Whoa.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.644
[FRANKY]
No time to waste.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:29.438
Gotta land the last shot
while you're reelin'!

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.190
Franky...

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.818
[laughs]

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:36.821
[FRANKY]
...Radical...

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.574
Stay in the robot, ya idiot!

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:43.411
It's fine, 'cause I've
got everything I need

00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:44.995
to fry this fish!

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:47.289
Take a look at my
ghost buddies here.

00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:49.417
They pack a pretty mean punch.

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.837
Now have a taste of my
Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack!

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.339
[GOTENKS GHOSTS yell]

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.467
The end. Heh-heh.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.511
--[AKAMEE roars]
--[GOTENKS screams]

00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:03.597
Is that all you got?

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.932
Huh?

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:10.730
[LUFFY panting]

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:13.357
[LUFFY]
Where'd you go, ya dumb fish?

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.696
[TORIKO]
I'm picking up its scent.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.489
It's close.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:21.699
Huh?

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:25.202
Damn, guys, did we
really beef it that bad?

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.046
Oh, dear. Do you think
they're all right?

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:40.760
Well, I wasn't expecting
it to evolve that far.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.514
The thing's quick.

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:46.640
[yells]

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:50.895
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Jet Pistol!

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:54.231
Huh? Luffy? Thanks, bro!

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.858
[LUFFY]
No prob.

00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:58.152
[LUFFY, TORIKO gasp]

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.403
Goku!

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:03.574
It looks like I made it here
in time to help stop this thing.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.659
Is that still the Akamee
or whatever?

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:07.620
'Cause it looks way different.

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:09.205
[LUFFY]
Huh? Ya think so?

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:13.042
[TORIKO] It's evolved into its
final form. A Big Toona.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.960
They say it's a hundred
times more powerful

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.253
than a Medium Toona,

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.048
and its flavor is a
hundred times stronger.

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.925
I've heard that it tastes
like all the best parts

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.593
of every creature in the sea.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.428
That sounds great. Let's eat!

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.180
Hang on, guys, I got this!

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.223
But don't worry.

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:30.059
I'll leave enough for you
both to have a bite!

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.022
[TORIKO]
Fork! Knife!

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:38.192
Five-fold Spiked Punch!

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:44.615
Gum-Gum... Bullet! Stamp! Bell!

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.454
[yelling]

00:13:53.958 --> 00:14:01.632
[GOKU]
Kamehame... ha!

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:06.762
[TORIKO] Thirty-six-fold...
Twin Spiked Punch!

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:14.395
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Elephant Gun!

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:22.111
[yelling]

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:32.288
[GOKU] Wow, Luffy.
That last move was nuts!

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:33.664
[LUFFY laughs]

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.833
Let's stick a fork
in this big fish.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:36.458
Nice!

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.586
[GOKU, TORIKO chuckle]

00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:00.065
[GOKU] How far did we send
that thing flying anyway?

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:01.650
[TORIKO] Uh, looks like
it must have landed

00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:02.776
somewhere in this canyon.

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:05.029
[LUFFY]
Man, that's a lotta canyon.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.614
Yeah, sure is.

00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:09.533
Let's keep going.
The sooner we can find-- Uh.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.411
You, uh, you okay?

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.996
[LUFFY, GOKU yell]

00:15:18.542 --> 00:15:20.336
[TORIKO]
Could it be?

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.175
[gasps]

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.099
[LUFFY]
That hurts!

00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.604
[yells]

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.777
Toriko! Are you okay?

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.320
I've lived through a lot worse.

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.572
What the heck is
that thing's deal?

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:50.783
[TORIKO] Looks like it
soaked up all our attacks

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.534
and evolved even further.

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.995
So on top of sucking the
energy out of its enemies,

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:58.040
it can convert whatever damage
it takes into more energy.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.209
If we don't stop it,
it's gonna keep growing

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.796
till it's gobbled up every
living creature on the planet.

00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:05.381
[LUFFY]
So what do we do now?

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:06.799
I think our best strategy here

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.634
is to hit it with a
simultaneous attack

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:12.888
and flash fry it with more
energy than its body can handle.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.390
Goku.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:19.979
Sorry, but I'll need you
guys to do me a favor.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.399
[BOTH yelling]

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.110
[GOKU] I think my Spirit Bomb
would be perfect for your plan.

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:26.944
[LUFFY]
Spirit Bomb?

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.153
[GOKU]
It's a technique where I gather

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.238
a little bit of life force

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.948
from every living being
on the planet,

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.825
from the land, the sea,
and the sky,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.119
and then I turn it into one
great big energy bomb.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.954
[LUFFY] Big enough to
cook this giant fish?

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:37.830
[GOKU]
Probably.

00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:39.081
But it's gonna take
me a little while

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:40.666
to build up all that energy.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.252
So I'll need the two of you
to buy me some time.

00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:44.503
[LUFFY]
Yeah, sure thing.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.171
[TORIKO]
Order up!

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.843
Just a bit more.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.431
Goku. Is it ready?

00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:57.641
What is this?
Something's not right.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:00.144
Why can't I store up
any more energy?

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:03.856
[TORIKO]
Huh? No way!

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.194
[TORIKO]
The Spirit Bomb stopped growin'

00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:10.946
'cause the Akamee's eating it!

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:13.240
Ah, damn it!

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:19.997
Hey, everybody! I need you
to lend me your energy!

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.374
That sounds like Dad's voice!

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:24.960
Put your hands in
the air, everybody!

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:28.172
That's right, let's all
send Goku our energy!

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.966
We got plenty of power
gathered up here!

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.218
This Spirit Bomb
is gonna be huge.

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:34.261
Crazy huge!

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.056
Heck yeah!

00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:38.223
[GOKU]
All right, that's it.

00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:41.310
Here it comes, here it
comes, here it comes...!

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:45.731
Now chew on this!

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.233
What?

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.362
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.406
[TORIKO]
Thirty-six-fold...

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:56.825
...Elephant Gatling!

00:17:56.867 --> 00:18:00.245
...Twin Spiked Punch!

00:18:02.206 --> 00:18:08.170
[GOKU]
Kamehame...

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.465
[yelling]

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.844
[yelling]

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:22.935
[GOKU]
...ha!

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:45.707
Man, I can't move a muscle.

00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:51.630
Yeah, same here.
I'm totally fried.

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:57.386
[chuckles] Right?
Plus, I am starvin'.

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.763
Yeah. Me, too.

00:19:00.931 --> 00:19:04.351
Me three. Let's eat, guys!
Once we can move again.

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:06.311
Yeah, sounds good!

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.771
A huge feast!

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:09.898
[ALL laughing]

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.110
[GOKU groans]

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.445
[TORIKO] I give humble
thanks for the vast bounty

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.239
this world provides.

00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:19.825
[ALL]
Now let's eat!

00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.578
[TORIKO]
These juices are incredible!

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.205
The meat seems to melt the
moment it touches your tongue!

00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:28.041
Big Toona is somethin'
else, amirite?!

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.960
[LUFFY]
It's so yummy!

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.171
[SANJI]
This is Big Toona carpaccio.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.882
I boiled down the bones from
the Carat Sizzled Cattle

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:36.049
for the sauce.

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:39.052
[NAMI] You turned my thousands
of carats into sauce?

00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:40.888
[USOPP] And eating it is
giving back all the energy

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:42.472
it took from us!

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:44.850
[CHOPPER]
Yum! This is the best!

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.269
[ROSHI] And the rump roast
ain't too bad, either!

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.478
[TINA screams]

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.315
[FRANKY] Whoa! What's
with this Mellow Cola?

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.317
It's super!

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:55.360
[SETSUNO] That pompadour's
pretty darn handsome!

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:58.697
[SUNNY] Honestly,
it's frustratingly beautiful!

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.742
[GOKU] Toriko! This fish is
so tasty it's ridiculous!

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.410
[TORIKO]
Sure, it goes without saying

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.370
that the Big Toona is delicious.

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:08.540
But there's more to it than that
because the greatest spice is--

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.084
[SATAN] 'Cause the greatest
spice is friendship!

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:12.419
[KOMATSU]
Again, pretty sure Toriko

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.046
was just about to get there.

00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:15.589
[MANSAM]
Well, in any case,

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.925
guess that closes
the tab on the Akamee.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:19.384
[LUFFY]
Hey, can we cook some more?

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:21.136
[TORIKO] I'd definitely
go for seconds!

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:22.095
[GOKU]
Yeah, same here!

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:23.639
[KOMATSU]
Coming right up!

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.141
[LUFFY] Hang on. Did we figure
out where Zoro went?

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.518
[TORIKO] Yeah, and Zebra
never showed up, either.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.104
[GOKU] Hey, Bulma,
wasn't Vegeta with you?

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.273
[BULMA]
Huh? I can't remember.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:34.274
[yells]

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.400
[roars]

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:37.819
[yells]

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:38.862
[KOMATSU]
Wait.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.658
Are those three still off
beating each other up?

00:20:43.992 --> 00:20:48.997
♪ Closing Song

00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:19.421
[NARRATOR]
Without warning,

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:22.424
the children begin crying
and collapsing in pain.

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:25.052
Chopper soon realizes the
cause of their suffering,

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:28.513
to the shock and horror
of his fellow Straw Hats.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.057
Meanwhile, as Zoro
and the others

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.892
search for the missing samurai,

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:34.561
two giant shadowy
figures approach.

00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:36.313
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:40.025
"Chopper's Fury! The Master's
Inhumane Experiment!"

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:42.861
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
