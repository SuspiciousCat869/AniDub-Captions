Yeah. They traded locations
with a branch called G1.

74

That moved them to the
other side of the Red Line.

more cocky than Sengoku was.

miss this place so much,

173
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,954
but I sure am glad to be back.

176
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:36,630
Women! Real women!

177
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,800
No stubble! No hairy
legs! No giant chins!

178
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,871
Just honest to goodness
beautiful girls!

179
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,073
How I've longed for your
delicate features.

180
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,608
Your soft skin.

181
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,210
To hear the intoxicating words
resting on your sweet lips!

182
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,246
Viva Sabaody!

183
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,447

[PINK-STRIPED QUEEN]
Sanji, dear!

186
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,753
It looks like this is farewell.

187
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,223
I hate to part, but we'll
meet again someday.

188

[SANJI]
Uh!

189
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,760
I hope not!

190
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,763
Thanks for the ride and say
hi to Iva, but go away!

191
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,964
What's up, ladies?

192
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:14,402
I'm fresh outta hell and
lookin' for a good time!

193
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,070
Like they say, if a
boy picks on a girl,

194
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,006
that means he has
a crush on her.

195
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,375
Oh, I know. Happens
to me all the time.

196
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,776
Love is patient, Sanji!

197
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,678
We'll wait! We know
you'll come back!

Or are you just stupid?

202
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,430
I know preschoolers with
higher bounties than that.

203
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:45,632
How 'bout you check
that poster again.

204
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,403
If your bounty is under 70
million, then we don't want you.

205
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,507
So why don't you take your weak
ass back to pirate daycare?

206
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:57,410
If that's all you're worth, it's
a wonder you made it this far.

207
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,280

00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,192
We're the chosen ones, boyo.

213
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,560
No chumps are gonna
run with this crew.

214
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,695
We're in a league of our own!

215
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,097
If you can't get with us,

216
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,733
you better get the hell
out of our way!

217
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,570
Too late.

That's rough.
Straw Hat is fierce.

'Course he is. He's a legend.

221
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,551
What's the count, Franky?
How many recruits we got?

222
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:39,553
[FAKE FRANKY] 'Bout a hundred
last time I checked.

223
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,854
Three whole crews joined up

224
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,623
along with ten guys
running solo.

225
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,392
They've got some
nice bounties, too.

00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,194
I know two of 'em.

228
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:52,699
Pair of high-profile rookies
joined at the same time.

229
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:56,436
"Wet-Haired" Caribou
and "Blood Splatter" Coribou.

230
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,271
They love killin' Marines.

231
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:02,543
Brothers and captains worth
210 million and 190 million.

232
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:06,513
Ha! Now, they answer to us!

233
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,749
And there's more where
they came from!

a good time,

Listen, I would not
turn that man down.

You realize that's Straw
Hat Luffy, right?

251
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,398
Yeah, the same Straw Hat
that burst into Marineford

252
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,901
and went head to head
with the Navy Admirals.

Your "friend" would probably
piss his pants if he saw him.

a nice ring to it, though.

347
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,939
[FRANKY]
Well, I'll be damned.

348
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,209
Not a scratch on the whole ship.

349
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,478
Sorry to keep you
waitin', Sunny.

350
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:46,680
We'll be sailin' off soon.

351
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:51,118
I almost forgot, the food
stalls here are great!

352
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,854
I hope everyone's okay.
I sure do miss them.

353
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,392
[chuckles]

354
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,626
[gasps]

355
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,061
[YOUNG GIRL A]
Ooh, I want the big one!

356
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,963
[YOUNG BOY A]
Thank you!

357
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,965
[squeals]

358
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,233
[gunshot]

359
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:13,173
Oh! Hey! Are you all right? Hey!

360
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:16,610
Why did he do that? He just
shot her out of the blue!

361
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,045
[WOMAN B]
That's awful!

362
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,181
Come on, we'll get a doctor.

363
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:22,216
You! What is wrong with you?

364
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,818
She didn't do a damn
thing to deserve that!

365
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,987
[FAKE LUFFY] Ugh. I thought
you were someone else.

366
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,990
I said sorry. So,
here's the deal.

367
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,892
I'm lookin' for some
punks who crossed me

368
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,860
and made a run for it.

369
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:37,030
A red-haired woman and
a guy with a long nose.

370
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:40,200
So you just shot her?
That's normal for you?

371
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,470
This won't end well.
Straw Hat's a monster.

372
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,805
Eh? You wanna fight about it?

373
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,008
'Cause I got plenty
more bullets.

374
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,312
Your choice, pal.

375
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,281
[MAN I screams]

376
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,253
Don't blame me. Blame your nose!

377
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:02,322
Hey. We'll get some
help! Stay with me!

378
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:06,126
Find those punks now,
or I'll shoot you, too!

379
00:22:07,294 --> 00:22:09,897
We got a reputation
to uphold here!

380
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,499
We gotta show this
place who's boss!

381
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:27,281
[BOTH gasp]

382
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:28,281
[gasps]

383
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,219
[LUFFY]
Uh?

384
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:34,287
Oops. Didn't see ya there.

385
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:38,158
Sorry 'bout that. See ya.

386
00:22:38,192 --> 00:22:39,793
That's guy's insane!

387
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:43,330
Either that, or he doesn't
know who Straw Hat is.

388
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,532
He's a dead man either way!

389
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,336
Get back here!

390
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,985
[LUFFY]
Huh?

391
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,829
[NARRATOR] A crew of fake
Straw Hats has formed,

392
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,264
taking advantage of
the disappearance

393
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,532
of the real Straw Hats.

394
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,668
Luffy, in disguise, crosses
paths with the fake Luffy,

395
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,138
who casues a scene in
the middle of Sabaody.

396
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,473
Unaware of who he's facing,

397
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,608
the imposter finds himself
on the receiving end

398
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,643
of a mysterious power.

399
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,077
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

400
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,615
"An Explosive Situation!
Luffy vs. Fake Luffy!"

401
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,150
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
