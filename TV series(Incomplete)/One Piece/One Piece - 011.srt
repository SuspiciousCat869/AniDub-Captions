00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,700
and I understand that you're
hurt, but lying like this,

176
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,735
it's not like you.

177
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,873
Kaya, please.
I'm telling you the truth.

178
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,879
[USOPP]
I'm telling you the truth.

179
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,616
Please believe me!

180
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,200
[KIDS]
What?!

181
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,436
Pirates are going to
attack the village?!

182
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,472
Then they're gonna kill Kaya?!

183
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,076
Yep. That's what they said.
No question 'bout it.

184
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,611
[ALL yelping]

185
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,450
So, what made you think
it'd be a good time for a nap?

186
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,651
That's the thing,

187
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,488
I don't remember going to sleep
or getting down here at all!

188
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,657
This proves it!
Klahadore is a bad guy!

189
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,559
Usopp saw right though him!

190
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,494
I bet he's on his way
to warn the villagers

191
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,496
so they'll have
time to run away.

192
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,397
Well, that's perfect.

193
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,466
Those stupid pirates
won't hurt anyone

194
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,734
because the town
will be abandoned

195
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,335
by the time they get there!

196
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,303
Yeah, that's right!

197
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,572
We'd better run away
too if we wanna live!

198
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,140
[PEPPER] All right, let's
pack our treasure and‐‐

199
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,476

Run like the wind! Ah!

201
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,516
Oh no!

202
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,016
What's up?

203
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,184
[LUFFY screaming]

204
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,087
We need to stock up before
the meat shop guy leaves!

205
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,657
[ZORO] C'mon, that's not
really the issue at hand here.

206
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:49,201
[KAYA]
Hello, Usopp. So...

207
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,471
What adventure are you
going to tell me about today?

208
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,341
[USOPP]
Hmm. Well, let's see.

209
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,478
[USOPP]
Oh, I know!

210
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,815
What about the story of
me fighting a giant gold fish?

211
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,618
At the south pole, when
I was only five years old.

212
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,552
That's a good one!

213
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,823
[KAYA] A goldfish?
You fought a goldfish?

214
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,726
[USOPP] A giant goldfish!
It was so huge,

215
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,561
a fish tank the size
of this mansion

216
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,663
wouldn't be able to hold it!

217
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,798
[KAYA]
Oh my!

218
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,801
[USOPP laughing]

219
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,135
[USOPP]
What first astounded me

220
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,870
was the immense
size of its poop!

221
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,406
I thought it was solid ground!

222
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,675
It was so big, that
when I landed on it,

223
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,744
I thought it was
some kind of island.

224
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,580
[KAYA]
Uhh... That sounds fake.

225
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,682
[USOPP] Believe me,
I know it sounds fake,

226
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,418
but every word of it is true.

227
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:44,690
[KAYA, USOPP laughing]

228
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,892
[USOPP] My first mistake
was lighting the bonfire

229
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,695
to dry my clothes off with.
That was just plain dumb.

230
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,529
[KAYA]
Why's that?

231
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,697
[USOPP]
Well, the next thing I knew,

232
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,667
there was a giant gold fish
with his rear end on fire

233
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,902
‐‐and guess who he was mad at!
‐‐[KAYA] Oh, dear!

234
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,404
[USOPP]
Well, I can't say I blame him!

235
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,538
As far as he knew,

236
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,174
I trying to turn him into
a giant grilled gold fish!

237
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,443
[USOPP laughing]

238
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,183
I loved them.

239
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,552
Every... one.

240
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:19,225
All those lies you told me.
They brought joy to my heart.

241
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,461
But... this is just
vengeful poison.

242
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,798
Kaya, please.

243
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,301
Listen to me, I'm not just
trying to get back at Klahadore.

244
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,905
Why would you do
that? It's wrong.

245
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,406
Kaya... I...

okay up here?

250
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,260
Let's get out of here!
Right now!

251
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,296
Usopp! Stop it!

252

Unhand her immediately,
you villain!

Please, trust me, Kaya.

254
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,969
You gotta get out
of this village

255
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,338
before that butler gets back.

256
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,361
Stop it!

C'mon!

258
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
I promise this'll all
make sense tomorrow,

259
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,874
but right now we need to go.

I made the call for

richly rewarded.

generous when I divide the take.

Who're you?

285
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,505
[USOPP] I'm Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea!

286
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,307
I've heard you've been
a little down lately

287
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,643
so I thought I'd tell you
a story to cheer you up.

288
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,079
[KAYA] You would do well
to mind your own business!

00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,649
Please leave or I'll call
someone who will make you leave!

[USOPP]
Hey, calm down.

291
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,185
You're right, I should leave.

292
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,787
I'm sorry, I've always been
meddlesome like this.

293
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,356
Ha, ha. It's not always
a bad thing though.

294
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,158
One time, when I
was three years old,

295
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,360
my meddling led me
to saving a sick whale!

296

What? A whale?

You bet!

A whale of a whale even, and
it had a really sore throat.

299
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,701
So, I walked into his
mouth to check it out,

300
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,137
but he thought I was food.

Alive?

309
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,067
Yeah! And I had
a pretty good nap!

310
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,568
He was sleeping the whole time!

311
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,504
Captain, we heard all
about those pirates

312
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,638
and their evil plan!

313
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,740
We'd better hurry and warn
the people in the village

314
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,742
so they have time to get away!

315
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,579
Warn the people...

00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,317
You're pathetic.

00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,087
Stop it.

00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,256
We all know you're
nothing but a liar.

319
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,527
It would do you some good

320
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,197
to follow Klahadore's example
of hard work and honesty.

00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,182
Well, obviously,
I'm lying like usual!

That butler made me
so mad with what he said,

324
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,520
I thought I'd get him back and
say that he was a pirate!

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,269
[CARROT] Honestly, you've
really disappointed me.

331
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,137
Yeah.

332
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,738
Even though that
butler guy is a jerk,

333
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,141
I thought you were better
than lying to hurt someone,

334
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,444
and I admired you for being
such a kind‐hearted person.

335
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,478
[ONION]
And to think,

336
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,148
we respected you
this entire time.

337
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,816
[CARROT]
I was wrong about him, guys.

338
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,151

So was I.

339
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,285

Let's go home.

There. All done.

344
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,948
So, how come you lied to them?

345
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,517
Because all I do is lie.

346
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,955
[USOPP] There's no way
anybody was gonna believe

347
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,926
what I had to say.
Why should they?

348
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,363
Because what you were telling
them was the honest truth.

349
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,968
They are coming. And they're
gonna level this whole town.

350
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,537
Yeah, but what am
I supposed to do?

351
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,973
They'll think I'm lying
if I try to warn them.

352
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,041
Everyone in the village thinks

353
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,511
that tomorrow's just gonna
be another normal day.

354
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,351
They think I'm lying and
that's all they need to think.

355
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,721
I'm gonna stop those pirates
at the beach tomorrow myself!

356
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,659
This is all my fault
for being such a liar.

357
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,860
I don't care anymore

358
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:39,464
if they drive me away with
brooms or shoot me in the arm.

359
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,233
This is my village.

360
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,569
It's my home... and
I love everyone in it!

361
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,509
I have to protect them.

362
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,677
You're a hell of a good guy,

363
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,913
sending your cronies away
and going into battle alone.

364
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,048
[NAMI]
Just so you know,

365
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,483
I have dibs on all the
pirate treasure, you got it?

366
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,752
So, you want a little
help or what?

367
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,753
You guys...

368
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,989
You're gonna help me fight
all these pirates?

369
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,090
I don't get it?

370
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,727
Well, you said there's a whole
buncha bad guys, right?

371
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,762
And you look scared
out of your mind.

372
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,265
Ugh. For your information,
I have nerves of steel!

373
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,667
I'm perfectly okay
with tons of bad guys!

374
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,570
After all, you're looking at
the legendary Captain Usopp,

375
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,672
brave warrior of the high seas!

376
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,378
Damnit! All right,
fine, I'm scared!

377
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,547
Why shouldn't I be?!
They're Captain Kuro's men!

378
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,048
These guys mean business!

379
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,550
I don't need pity!

380
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,885
If you guys are sticking
around cause you pity me,

381
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,455
just leave! I don't need
you laughin' at me!

382
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,856
We're not laughing at you.

383
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,759
We're helping because
you are honorable.

384
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,963
You really think we'd
risk our lives out of pity?

385
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,805
Aw... You guys!

[LUFFY] Huh. Why did Usopp
cover this slope in oil?

404
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,160
[ZORO]
It's part of his plan.

405
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,728
[NAMI]
That's a weird plan.

406
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,464
[LUFFY]
So, where are these pirates?

407
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,499
[ZORO] What?! They're
at the north shore!

408

[LUFFY]
I'll go on ahead!

409

[NAMI] They better not lay
a finger on my treasure!

410

Which way is north?!
