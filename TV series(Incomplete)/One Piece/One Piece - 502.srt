1
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,122
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,859
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,427
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,430
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,965
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,768
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,436
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,372
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,242
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,877
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,411
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,615
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,185
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,655
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,825
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,529
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,902
[NARRATOR] The Navy triumphed
in the War of the Best

18
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:26,373
and Luffy, unable to save his
brother Ace, fell into despair.

19
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,143
But this is a story from ten
years ago, in the East Blue.

20
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,346
What the hell did you do?

21
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,215
[ACE groans]

22
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,883
Ace! No!

23
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,451
Don't do it!

24
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,788
[gunshot]

25
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,661
[LUFFY]
"Where Can Freedom Be Found?

26
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,330
A Sad Departure of a Boy!"

27
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,100
[gasps]

28
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,205
[BLUEJAM grunts]

29
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,839
Dadan!

30
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,111
Don't you dare hurt my boys!

31
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,781
[ACE gasps]

32
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,683
I'm not afraid to kill you!

33
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,457
[BLUEJAM grunts]

34
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,458
[ACE grunts]

35
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,394
[DADAN panting]

36
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,296
Thanks, but what are
you guys doing here?

37
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,131
We aren't too late, are we?

38
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,367
Yikes, you got roughed
up pretty bad, Luffy.

39
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,436
You okay?

40
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,104
I'll make it.

41
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,442
And what about Sabo?
I don't see him.

42
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,045
He's safe in High Town.
He isn't with us anymore.

43
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:43,750
[ACE growls]

44
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,851
Easy, now.

45
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,186
[BLUEJAM]
I know you.

46
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,522
You're that bandit
gorilla from Mount Corvo.

47
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,024
Bandit, yes, gorilla, no.

48
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,759
But that's not the point here.

49
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,728
The point is, like it or not,

50
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,830
these kids are my
responsibility.

51
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,232
[BLUEJAM grunts]

52
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,801
Even if I've felt like
killing the brats myself,

53
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,403
that doesn't mean you get to.

54
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,405
Now, I'll say it again,

55
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,707
nobody hurts my boys.

56
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,977
So, I'll let you walk away,

57
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,680
but if you don't, I guarantee
you're gonna be sorry.

58
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:16,617
[BANDITS grumbling]

59
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,318
[BLUEJAM grunts]

60
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,592
I got nothin' to lose.

61
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,462
All right, then. Let's dance.

62
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,268
[DADAN]
Now! Everybody run!

63
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,071
[BANDITS]
Roger, Boss!

64
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,773
[DADAN, BANDITS panting]

65
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,841
Hurry up! What're you doin'?

66
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,543
Ace, we gotta get going!

67
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:43,344
[ACE grunts]

68
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,011
What's the matter?

69
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,082
[ACE]
I'm staying.

70
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,182
[BLUEJAM]
Huh?

71
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,420
I won't run!

72
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,555
[DADAN gasps]

73
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,824
You've got nothing to gain
here, you little idiot!

74
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,892
Look, this place is on fire!

75
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,695
Also, Bluejam is
a hardened criminal!

76
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,265
A little kid like you shouldn't
be fighting him to the death!

77
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,702
--I-I gotta help Ace!
--Luffy, cut it out!

78
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,171
Dammit! Stop!

79
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,306
[BANDITS gasp]

80
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,610
Take Luffy and get your
butts back to the hideout.

81
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:17,712
What about you?

82
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,946
I'll take care of Ace,

83
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,749
no matter how many
asses I gotta kick!

84
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,519
[BANDITS]
You're so cool.

85
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,356
Now, go!

86
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,190
[BANDITS]
Yes, ma'am!

87
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,525
[LUFFY]
Ace!

88
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,160
[BANDIT B]
Come home safe, Boss!

89
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:35,228
We'll be waiting for you!

90
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,035
[BLUEJAM]
Look at that, how brave.

91
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:44,204
But at the end of the day,

92
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,241
you're just a woman and
a child against a pirate.

93
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,776
Do you like those odds?

94
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,712
Only two kinds of people
survive in battle:

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,181
the strong and the cowardly.

96
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,883
Bravery doesn't enter
the picture, I'm afraid.

97
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,120
Oh, is that so?

98
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,789
[BLUEJAM]
Hmm. Have it your way.

99
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:07,861
Take this!

100
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,496
[DADAN yells]

101
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,069
[MAN A]
We're all dead!

102
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,373
[MAN A]
Look around you!

103
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:21,375
There's no way out now!

104
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,244
Everything was fine! How
could this happen so quickly?

105
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,413
[MAN I]
I'm burning! I'm burning!

106
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,415
[MAN J]
You and everyone else!

107
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,318
[MAN C yells]

108
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,322
Just let me die already.

109
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,861
[MAN E gasps]

110
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,400
[MEN groaning]

111
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,948
[MAN F]
What the heck was that?

112
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,618
Hey! It made a path
through the fire!

113
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,753
[MAN K] Whoa, did somebody
do that on purpose?

114
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:09,490
[MAN L] Who cares! Now we
can get out of this hellhole!

115
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,525
[MAN H]
Hey! Look you guys!

116
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,262
There's a ship here! It's
waiting down by the shore!

117
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,164
[MAN M] I dunno who
and I don't know how,

118
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:19,733
but I think they're here
to save us! Let's go!

119
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,901
[ALL shouting]

120
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,137
[MAN N] Hurry, before
the fire comes back!

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,010
I've seen nobles do
some dreadful things,

122
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,277
but this takes the cake.

123
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,879
Absolutely reprehensible!

124
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,715
Anyhoo, this locale is
rather out of the way.

125
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,518
How did you hear the news?

126
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,087
Were you keeping
an eye on this country?

127
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,491
Or perhaps, is there something
here of interest to you?

128
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,858
What's happening here

129
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,061
will happen in the rest
of the world soon enough.

130
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,797
Human beings can't
be thrown away.

131
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,968
A world that allows
that must change.

132
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,802
No matter how long it takes,

133
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,573
I will stomp out this
misery and injustice.

134
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:04,544
I can't stay here, 'cause if
I do, then I'll never be free!

135
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,748
The children born
in this country

136
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,584
must have a future that
they can believe in.

137
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:22,028
[ALL gasping]

138
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,830
If it's freedom you want,

139
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,533
so long as you have the
will to fight for it,

140
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,902
you are welcome
aboard this ship!

141
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,638
[ALL gasp]

142
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,307
[ALL cheering]

143
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,455
[SABO'S MOM]
Did they find Sabo yet?

144
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,223
[SABO'S DAD] I called
in the military for help.

145
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,259
They'll find him soon enough.
All we can do now is wait.

146
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,696
[SABO'S MOM] I see. He does
like to give us a hard time.

147
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,232
That he does.

148
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,005
[NOBLE BB] Are you sure
that wall will protect us?

149
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,807
Seems like the fire could
spread here any second.

150
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,979
It won't last long.

151
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,815
Surely, they'll let us into
High Town till it passes.

152
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,049
Not a chance.

153
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,984
[NOBLE O gasps]

154
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,585
[NOBLE A]
Those gates are so tight,

155
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,721
even a flea can't get through.

156
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:25,992
[BANDITS crying]

157
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,561
Let me go!

158
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,663
Come back, Boss!

159
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,932
[BANDIT C, BANDIT D]
Ace, too!

160
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,467
No! You can't die!

161
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,238
[NARRATOR] No matter
how their friends cried,

162
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,509
Ace and Dadan did not
emerge from the flames

163
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,977
consuming Gray Terminal.

164
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:54,120

166
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,692
[MAGRA]
Easy, kiddo.

167
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,428
You're still hurt,
what're you doin'?

168
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:04,331
[LUFFY] What do ya think?
I'm looking for Ace and Dadan!

169
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,499
[MAGRA sighs]
That's not gonna work!

170
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:09,770
[LUFFY]
Ow!

171
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,472
[MAGRA]
See? Told you!

172
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,974
You'll just make things worse!

173
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,642
[LUFFY grunts]

174
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:21,548
I'm worried, too, but for right
now, we just have to wait.

175
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,251
The military is down
in Gray Terminal.

176
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,620
Word is, they were sent
in to clean up everything

177
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,889
after the fire died down.

178
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,357
And by "clean up," I mean

179
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,160
"take care of any
remaining evidence."

180
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:36,664
I'm sure that extends to
killing off the survivors, too.

181
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,032
You'd be no exception.

182
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,500
But, Ace!

183
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,513
I can't just leave
him out there!

184
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,718
And we have to let Sabo
know that we didn't die!

185
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,954
[crying]

186
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,493
[NOBLE SOLDIER A laughs]
Hell of a view, don't you think?

187
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,495
[NOBLE SOLDIER B] Hell of
a mess we have to clean up!

188
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,864
Nothin' to laugh about,
that's for sure!

189
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,274
[NOBLE SOLDIER C]
Huh. Orders say to shoot

190
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:22,276
any survivors we find on sight.

191
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,144
[NOBLE SOLDIER D]
Yeah? What survivors?

192
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,312
[NOBLE SOLDIER C]
It's weird, though.

193
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,414
I've hardly seen any corpses.

194
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,882
[NOBLE SOLDIER D]
That fire was pretty intense.

195
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,452
Probably burned up
their bones, too.

196
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,822
I was up all night, scared that
fire would get over the wall.

197
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,658
Shoulda known they wouldn't
burn decent people like us.

198
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,595
I heard Bluejam's ship
wasn't quite so lucky.

199
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,729
[NOBLE B]
Good!

200
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,731
Let's hope the bastard
was on it when it burned.

201
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,538
[SABO groans]

202
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,940
It's morning!

203
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,442
[groans]

204
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:03,750
[groaning]

205
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,387
[panting]

206
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,357
[DOG panting]

207
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:13,493
[NOBLE N] Why, good morning!
What a beautiful day!

208
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:18,098
Yes. I dare say it's even
more lovely than yesterday.

209
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:29,609
[grunts]

210
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,779
Damn it, they're
all over the place.

211
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:32,879
[gasps]

212
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,682
[NOBLE SOLDIER E]
It's been a long night.

213
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:39,619
What d'you say you give up
the hide and seek and go home?

214
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,673
[slap]

215
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,577
[SABO groans]

216
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,980
Can't you see it will
always end this way, Sabo?

217
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,516
The police and military
have photos of you.

218
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,452
Try all you want.
There's no escape!

219
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:15,355
You'll never get out of High
Town, let alone this house,

220
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,457
unless I expressly permit it.

221
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,859
[SABO grunts]

222
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:20,594
I need you on guard duty.

223
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,397
Now, I'll look into
getting you new uniforms.

224
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,398
[NOBLE GUARDS gasp]

225
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,466
I'm sorry sir, but
we have other duties.

226
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,003
I'm a nobleman. That means
I get what I want.

227
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,773
Don't worry, I'll have
a word with your superiors.

228
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,207
[NOBLE GUARDS]
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,446
Listen, Sabo.
It's not too late for you.

230
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,014
From now on,
you'll lock yourself

231
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,317
in your room and learn
to be a proper noble.

232
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,050
[SABO]
No!

233
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,752
I don't want to be cruel,

234
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:50,124
but I am certainly capable of it
and anything else I so desire.

235
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,127
You could disappear,
just like your friends.

236
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,828
[gasps]

237
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,396
[SABO'S DAD]
Are we clear?

238
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,399
I think so.

239
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:05,338
[SABO]
Ace. Luffy.

240
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,813
[SABO'S DAD] If Stelly can
study hard, then so can you.

241
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,948
Everything will work out fine.

242
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:15,750
[SABO grunts]

243
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,183
And then your parents,

244
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,820
who worked so hard to build
a proper future for you,

245
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,154
can finally be happy.

246
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,756
Won't that be nice?

247
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:27,528
[SABO'S DAD] I'm sure it'll
be nice for you as well.

248
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,163
Just give it some time.

249
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,066
[STELLY]
Papa!

250
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,569
[SABO'S DAD, STELLY laughing]

251
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,938
[STELLY]
If you're sad, I can help!

252
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,139
[STELLY giggles]

253
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:42,209
[SABO'S DAD chuckles]
Dependable as always, Stelly!

254
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,812
We've got that big ceremony
coming up, you know.

255
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,613
Let's buy you some new clothes.

256
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,514
[STELLY]
Heh.

257
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:48,582
[SABO'S DAD]
You'll look so handsome

258
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,784
for the Celestial Dragon!

259
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,361
[SABO]
There's nothing I can do.

260
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,163
I'm helpless.

261
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,837
[SABO'S MOM] All right, that
should do it for today's lesson.

262
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,738
[gasps]

263
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,980
Study hard and I'll check
your homework tomorrow.

264
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,382
Have a pleasant afternoon!

265
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,562
[SABO]
Don't worry, guys. I'm fine.

266
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:39,333
And you're tough,
so I know you're okay, too.

267
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,302
There's no way you
died in that fire.

268
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:56,716
[SABO] I just wish
I could see you, even once.

269
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,287
[SABO]
But if people follow me,

270
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,822
they'll find out
you're still alive

271
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,357
and you'll be in danger again.

272
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,861
[SABO]
It looks nice from the outside,

273
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,097
but this house is a birdcage.

274
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,231
I'm gonna lose my mind

275
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,134
if I have to stay in this
stuffy, stuck-up place.

276
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:18,838
[birds chirping]

277
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:21,875
[SABO]
I thought I found freedom,

278
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,045
but it seems to
keep slipping away.

279
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,148
Hey, your shift is over.

280
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,484
Oh, yeah? I lost track of time.

281
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,753
That's because
you were sleeping.

282
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,088
No kidding.

283
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,523
By the way, how are
things going in town?

284
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,092
The big ceremony
is tomorrow, isn't it?

285
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,861
[NOBLE GUARD A]
Yeah, and it's wild out there.

286
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,097
Everyone's worked up.

287
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,898
[NOBLE GUARD B]
Well, that sucks for me.

288
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,901
A once in a lifetime chance
and I'm stuck in here.

289
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,737
They have me working all day,
while they go to the ceremony.

290
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:52,473
Nobody else is gonna
be in the house,

291
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,809
so I gotta watch the kid
to make sure he doesn't bail.

292
00:17:55,842 --> 00:18:00,847
[sighs] A World Noble...
I've never seen one.

293
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,117
I wouldn't say it's
all bad, buddy.

294
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,886
I mean, just think,
the harbor will be a mess.

295
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,621
The whole town's gonna be there.

296
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,890
That's a lot of people
to keep track of

297
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,060
and you only have this one.
That's easy peasy.

298
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,396
If that's how you feel,
why don't we trade places?

299
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,099
[NOBLE GUARD A laughs]
Yeah, you wish.

300
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,739
[SABO'S DAD]
All right! We're off.

301
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,143
Take good care of Sabo.
We won't be back until late.

302
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,578
[NOBLE GUARD B]
Yes, sir. As you wish.

303
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:38,685

[NARRATOR]
After much anticipation,

307
00:18:58,105 --> 00:18:59,973
the day of the
World Noble's visit

308
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,510
to the Goa Kingdom
arrives at last.

309
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,512
A lavish ceremony is prepared

310
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,216
to greet his ship as
it enters the harbor.

[SOLDIER A] Hello, this is
Team A on the coast.

315
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,096
[SUPERIOR A] The Celestial
Dragon's ship is pulling in

316
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,567
as we speak. It should arrive at
your location in a few minutes.

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,803
Understood, sir.
Everything looks good.

318
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,573
We'll keep an eye out for
anything strange, though.

[NOBLE E gasps]
Hey, wait!

322
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:46,153
Is that... a ship leaving port?

323
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,121
[CROWD gasps]

324
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:47,888
A what?

325
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:49,489
A fishing boat?

326
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,561
Hey! Come back!

327
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,795
You're blocking their path!

328
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,465
Why, it's just a child!

329
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,735
A little boy is
steering that boat.

330
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,636
Then, h-he's a noble?

331
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,939
But surely all the families
are here watching!

332
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,440
It can't be.

333
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,209
[SABO'S MOM gasps]
No, it can't!

334
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,445
Sabo. He's still at home.

335
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,914
I gave the guard strict orders.

336
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,920
[gasps]

337
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,994
Nice weather today!

338
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,863
It's just perfect
for setting sail!

339
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,671
Crap! That's mine!
It was stolen!

340
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,007
I have nothing to
do with this mess!

341
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,910
His flag! He's got
a jolly roger on it!

342
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,713
Is he trying to be
a pirate or something?

343
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,882
Does it matter? The kid's
flag isn't the issue here!

344
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,818
[NOBLE L] He's heading
straight for the ship.

345
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,020
The Celestial Dragon
isn't gonna like this.

346
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,321
[SUPERIOR A]
Either you lose that boat,

347
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:57,858
or you lose your job,
do you hear me? Fix it, now!

348
00:20:57,891 --> 00:20:59,192
Uh, yes, sir!

349
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:01,728
Hey!

350
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,298
Get back here, kid!
Are you nuts?!

351
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:09,770
I'm not afraid of anything
as long as I'm free.

352
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,406
I just have to be
far away from here.

353
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,808
I have to follow my own dream.

354
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,714
Nobody's gonna change me.

355
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,452
Huh? Holy crap, Sabo,

356
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,787
what do ya think
you're doin' out there?

357
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,726
[NOBLE SOLDIER F] Give them
a warm welcome, everyone!

358
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:53,814
[gasps] Wow, that's
one big ship!

359
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:56,283
It could run right
over me, easy.

360
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,619
Let's avoid that, shall we?

361
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,426
[gasps] He's moving.

362
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,727
That almost got pretty ugly.

363
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:14,301
[CROWD cheering]

364
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,936
[JALMACK]
What is this display?

365
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,638
Are the commoners
attempting to welcome us?

366
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,140
Yes, sir.

367
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,142
[JALMACK]
Hm?

368
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,543
[NOBLE AA]
This is a first for me!

369
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:26,346
The Celestial Dragons hardly
ever make visits like this!

370
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,348
[NOBLE CC]
I hope nobody mucks this up!

371
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:30,851
We didn't burn all
those people for nothing!

372
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:34,121
[JALMACK] By the way, what is
that wretched little thing?

373
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,857
[SUBORDINATE A] Hm. It seems
to be a fishing boat, sir.

374
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,430
That's so cool.

375
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:46,566
I hope I'm the captain of
a big ship like that someday.

376
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,204
It's time to learn your place!

377
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:56,143
[yells]

378
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:58,445
[CROWD gasping]

379
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,715
Insolent fool!

380
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:04,418
What's going on?
He just opened fire!

381
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,853
[NOBLE O screams]

382
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,266
[NARRATOR] Ace and Dadan
return to their hideout safely

383
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,034
after their battle with Bluejam.

384
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,870
However, the mountain bandits
scarely have time to celebrate

385
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,308
before the news of Sabo's
tragedy reaches their ears.

386
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,143
Luffy despairs
and Ace vows revenge,

387
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,213
but a letter from Sabo
changes their perspective.

388
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,115
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

389
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:38,252
"Take Good Care of Him!
A Letter From the Brother!"

390
00:23:38,285 --> 00:23:40,787
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
