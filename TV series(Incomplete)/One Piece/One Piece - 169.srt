1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,041
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,258
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,178
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:52,519
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,048
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,343
[NARRATOR]
Searching for the treasures of

25
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:27,762
the lost City of Gold,
the crew splits up into Nami's

26
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:31,558
escape team and
Luffy's exploration team.

27
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:35,812
Agreeing to meet again on
the eastern shore, they set out.

28
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:40,150
Unfortunately, while heading
south toward the ancient ruins,

29
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:45,488
Luffy's team is attacked by
a giant snake and separated.

30
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:49,409
This is bad.

31
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,328
I know I'm on the right
path but where is everyone?

32
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:54,581
Are they lost?
Should I wait for them?

33
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:59,336
[CHOPPER sobs]

34
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,588
I'm lost guys! Wait for me!

35
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:04,174
[ZORO] Well, it figures,
I turn my back for one second

36
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,301
and they go and get lost on me.

37
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:09,387
Well, whatever, they know how
to take care of themselves.

38
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:11,806
And I got most of the
map memorized anyway.

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,142
I go to the right.

40
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,895
Where did everybody go?
Did they get lost?

41
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,229
I better keep moving.

42
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,231
I'll catch up with
them later at the ruins.

43
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,859
Robin said we had to go south,
and it always gets warmer

44
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:26,071
when you go south,
so I go this way!

45
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:33,328
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Wyper
and the Shandorian warriors

46
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:36,748
head for God's Shrine
to defeat Eneru.

47
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,750
But, using his
all-seeing mantra,

48
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,378
Eneru has had his priests
set up their ordeals

49
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,089
across the whole island.

50
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,591
The survival game has begun!

51
00:03:49,552 --> 00:03:53,515
[LUFFY] "The Deadly Reject!
War Demon Wyper's Resolve!"

52
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,065
[GAN FALL] When we first met,
I acted as a soldier-for-hire

53
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:05,568
to protect you, because you
Blue Sea Dwellers are unfamiliar

54
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,612
with the ways of sky warfare.

55
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,323
[USOPP]
Sky warfare? What do you mean?

56
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,451
[GAN FALL] Hmm. Perhaps if you
move that barrel over here.

57
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,869
[STRAW HATS]
The barrel?

58
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,250
[GAN FALL]
Now observe.

59
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,877
Would someone explain
to me why we're doing this?

60
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,379
[GAN FALL]
All will be clear.

61
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:27,549
Now strike that shell with all
of your might, young man.

62
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:29,342
Just take it easy, Sanji!

63
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,678
If you put a hole in my deck,
I'll put enough holes in you

64
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,513
to make a Swiss cheese jealous!

65
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,682
[GAN FALL] Hit it with all
the strength you've got!

66
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,100
Hey, have a little respect for

67
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:40,562
other people's property
when you're a guest, old man!

68
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,856
Well, it's your show, old timer.

69
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,066
[USOPP]
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

70
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,318
Do you have to
wind up into it like that?

71
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,403
[SANJI grunts]

72
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,574
--[SANJI grunts]
--[gasps]

73
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,909
[USOPP]
Whoa, that was just sad.

74
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,661
I know I said take it easy,
but you didn't have

75
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,621
to be that pathetic.

76
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:00,749
[USOPP] You didn't even
put a ding in the barrel.

77
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,754
No. I gave that swing
everything I had,

78
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,506
like I was really trying
to put a hole in the deck.

79
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,425
[USOPP]
Hey now!

80
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:13,386
[SANJI] It sounds crazy, but
it's like this shell absorbed

81
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,638
all the force of the impact.

82
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,057
[BOTH]
Huh?

83
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,976
[GAN FALL] Now if you'd
be so good as to turn

84
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,562
the shell's holes towards the
barrel and lightly press

85
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:24,105
the tip on the back.

86
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:27,901
[GAN FALL] You're familiar
with the operation

87
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,862
of dial power, yes?

88
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,697
[SANJI]
Hmm.

89
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,574
Right here?

90
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,785
[screams]

91
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:37,994
[grunts]

92
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,259
[GAN FALL] That, my friends,
is an Impact Dial.

93
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:56,471
It absorbs any impact it
receives and then releases

94
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,473
the energy when it's pressed.

95
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:01,184
It is frequently affixed
to the palm of the hand

96
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,395
with a glove or a bandage.

97
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:05,855
A direct hit from one
of these has more than

98
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:09,234
enough power to kill
an average person easily.

99
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,988
I know. Usopp?

100
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,493
[USOPP sighs]
Yeah, you're right,

101
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,537
that's what that butterball
priest was using!

102
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,586
[SATORI]
I warned you didn't I?

103
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,838
Impact!

104
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,006
[SANJI]
Why didn't you warn us?

105
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:33,675
That scared the hell
out of me, old man!

106
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,468
[GAN FALL] I have heard
that in ancient times

107
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,721
on other sky islands
there existed dials

108
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,806
even more powerful
than this one.

109
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,143
The so-called Reject Dial was
said to be capable of magnifying

110
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:46,104
the energy it stored and
released ten times the power

111
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,440
of a mere Impact Dial.

112
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:52,569
But that incredible power
was a double-edged sword.

113
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:55,030
For it threatened the
life of the attacker

114
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:57,407
as well as his opponent.

115
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,702
As a result,
it was very rarely used.

116
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,169
These little shells
are that dangerous?!

117
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,212
They're worse than
any weapon I know!

118
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,590
Yeah, I thought dials
were supposed to be common,

119
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,258
everyday objects.

120
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,801
[GAN FALL]
So they are.

121
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,971
But it seems that man has a
talent for finding deadly uses

122
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:22,432
for beneficial discoveries,
no matter how mundane

123
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:26,728
they may seem to be.
It all depends upon the user.

124
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,646
[PIERRE snores]

125
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,399
[GAN FALL] Dials are very
useful, but when applied

126
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:36,154
in battle, their power for
destruction can be awesome.

127
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,990
For example, the Heat
Dial used for cooking

128
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:43,203
can be placed inside a lance and
used to generate thermal energy,

129
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:46,790
creating the deadly weapon
known as the Heat Javelin.

130
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,710
[GAN FALL] Or the Flame Dial,
which stores fire,

131
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,922
can be placed in the mouth of
a bird, creating a creature

132
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,008
that seems to breathe fire.

133
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,302
[USOPP] Yeah, Chopper
mentioned something like that.

134
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,179
[NAMI]
And that's sky warfare?

135
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:02,806
[GAN FALL]
It is.

136
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,475
Blue Sea dwellers who
know nothing of Dials have

137
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:08,019
no way of seeing
through these tricks.

138
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:11,564
The same holds true for our
many types of artificial clouds.

139
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,110
The Priests have forged these
into forms they can control.

140
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:19,114
If you don't understand them,
you'll be helpless against them.

141
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:21,157
Wait a sec,
then is there any truth to

142
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,576
that mantra thing that
Tubby was talking about

143
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,412
that let him predict our moves?

144
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,790
[GAN FALL]
Yes, Mantra.

145
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:32,794
Unfortunately, I'm afraid that
I myself am unable to use it,

146
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:36,256
so it's rather difficult
for me to explain.

147
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,718
Mantra is described
as "an ability to hear"

148
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:42,012
the idea is that as long
as a person lives,

149
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,973
his or her body emits
its own voice.

150
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,141
[SANJI]
A voice?

151
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:48,560
[GAN FALL]
Yes. By listening to the voice,

152
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:52,230
you're supposed to be able to
know your opponent's next move.

153
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,648
With practice and training,

154
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:57,610
you can hear these voices
over a very large area.

155
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:01,656
The Priests can hear
over all of the Upper Yard.

156
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,785
Eneru's powers extend
across this entire land.

157
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:09,748
The exact nature of those
powers remains a mystery.

158
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:13,835
But because of them, the people
of this land can never know

159
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:15,628
a moment's ease.

160
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,382
[ENERU] I wonder if
they've made it down yet.

161
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,844
[AIDE A] Yes, lord. They are
lying in wait as we speak.

162
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:25,722
The three Priests have
placed their Ordeals.

163
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:30,018
And Commander Yama has taken
50 Divine Warriors with him.

164
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:34,230
My Lord, it looks as though this
is becoming an all-out war.

165
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:37,734
Is it really necessary
to go to such extremes?

166
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,986
The Shandorians
and a few Blue Sea dwellers

167
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,446
hardly seem worth it.

168
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,157
[ENERU laughs]

169
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,368
Come now, the more
players there are,

170
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,244
the more fun the game.

171
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:52,040
You, my hairy friend,
underestimate the power

172
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,751
of sky warfare.

173
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,544
[AIDE A]
Sky warfare, my Lord?

174
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,088
[ENERU]
That's right.

175
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,631
You'll see soon enough.

176
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:02,967
[laughs]

177
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,594
Peel that for me, would you?

178
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:07,597
Now, let's see.

179
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,974
We have the 50 Divine
Warriors at our disposal

180
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:14,938
plus our three surly Priests
including me that's 54.

181
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:18,858
[ENERU] There are 20 Shandorians
heading toward the island,

182
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,111
the four Blue Sea
Dwellers in the forest,

183
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:24,614
and the four escaping
down the Milky Road.

184
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,700
No, wait, that's only three.

185
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:29,285
The old man can't fight anymore.

186
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,621
Altogether, that makes 81.

187
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,791
This battle will determine
who will be left standing.

188
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:36,751
[laughs]

189
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:40,422
Shall we guess how many will
remain after three hours time?

190
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:44,134
[AIDE A] Pardon, Lord, you wish
us to make a game out of death?

191
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:45,969
[ENERU]
Oh, why don't you lighten up?

192
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,220
You, take a guess.

193
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:50,181
What? Are you
talking to me, my lord?

194
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,766
But I...

195
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,603
I don't know anything about it,
I'm just a humble serving girl.

196
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,814
Oh, come on!
What's wrong with you people?

197
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:02,152
You're no fun! Just take
a guess, any guess at all!

198
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:04,529
All right, then, you try it.
Go ahead. Guess.

199
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:05,864
[AIDE B grunts]

200
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:09,951
Well, uh, the three
Priests are all very strong,

201
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:12,787
of course, and those
Divine Warriors are all

202
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,706
extremely powerful as well.

203
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:17,917
[AIDE B] I doubt many
of them will be defeated,

204
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,338
but the enemy has shown
their power rivals the Priests,

205
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:25,175
so, in three hours time, I think
30 will fall, leaving,

206
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:30,388
let's see--81 minus 30--leaving
51 alive, how's that?

207
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,432
[laughs]

208
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:35,226
Fifty-one, eh?
That's your best guess?

209
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,312
Don't you think you're being
just a little optimistic,

210
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,272
or are you just squeamish?

211
00:11:39,356 --> 00:11:42,525
I think you're underestimating
the results of this battle.

212
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:50,283
[AIDE B] Uh, then what do you
think, my lord, if I may ask?

213
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,911
[ENERU] Well, it's obvious
if only you'd give it

214
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,329
a little thought.

215
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,831
In three hours,
of the 81 fighters

216
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:59,668
now on this island,
all that will be left are...

217
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:01,795
[ENERU]
...five.

219
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,119
What the--?

220
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,579
I can't move!

221
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:42,085
What's happening?
Why'd I stop moving?

222
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,796
[SHURA] Greetings,
my Shandorian friends!

226
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,803
[SHURA] I'm glad you
could come to my party.

[FUZA caws]

228
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:55,390
[SHANDORIANS]
Shura!

229
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,641
Now, now.

230
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,810
I appreciate your
enthusiasm, but honestly,

231
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:00,478
I know my own name!

232
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,772

[FUZA growls]

234
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,026
[SHURA] I'm afraid I've
got some very bad news.

235
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,445
[caws]

236
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,530
[SHURA] There have been
a few changes made here

237
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,366
on Upper Yard since last night.

238
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,993
[KAMAKIRI growls]

239
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:18,413
[SHURA]
Can't move, can you? Too bad.

240
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:22,042
You only have a 3%
chance of surviving.

241
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,003
[chuckles]
The Ordeal of String.

242
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:44,481
[caws]

243
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,691
No! Not the Ordeal of String!

244
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,152
I would've warned you,
but then I thought,

245
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,654
why ruin the surprise for them?

246
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:52,947
[growls]

247
00:13:55,992 --> 00:13:57,118
[KAMAKIRI gasps]

248
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,624
It's String Cloud!

249
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:05,877
[SHURA]
Oh, very good. I'm impressed.

250
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,673
[SHURA]
It's spread throughout my area.

251
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,759
Too thin to be seen,
but so tough, that even

252
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:16,221
the strongest man can't
break free once entangled.

253
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,767
[SHURA]
My mighty String Cloud.

254
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,977
You fools have been
wrapping yourselves up in it

255
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,480
from the moment you
set foot in this forest.

256
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,235
[SHURA]
Take a look around.

257
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:32,153
Your bodies are
covered in string.

258
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:36,700
You've all become my puppets--
mere playthings at my disposal!

259
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:39,327
[laughs]

260
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,872
Yes, all of you, except for one!

261
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,001

Fly, Fuza!

Wyper!

264
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:56,344
[SHURA] You can't beat me
in the air, you fool!

265
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,848
[KAMAKIRI grunts] Look out!
That's a Heat Javelin!

--[SHURA grunts]

267
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:09,733
[SHURA gasps] Why did you throw
away your shield and weapon?

268
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,526
Are you insane?

269
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,653
No, he wouldn't dare.

270
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,738
[WYPER growls]

271
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:21,578
Take it. If all you want's
a shoulder, it's yours.

[SHURA whimpers]

273
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:29,085
An Impact Dial?
But that can't kill me!

274
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:32,589
[WYPER chuckles]
No. Ten times that power!

275
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,675

[FUZA caws]

279
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,041
[ENERU] And the
Upper Yard survival game

280
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:13,088
has its first casualty.
Now only 80 remain.

281
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,216
So the first battle has
ended in a stunning upset.

282
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,093
Shura is finished.

283
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:21,388
[AIDE A]
Wh-What? But how?

284
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:23,390
[ENERU] Like you, Shura
underestimated the power

285
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:26,434
of sky warfare. The fool!

286
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,269
[laughs]

287
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,730
[AIDE B]
But surely this is a disaster!

288
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,941
No Priest has been
defeated in six years,

289
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:36,361
and now suddenly two have
fallen in as many days!

290
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,780
[ENERU]
Nonsense. So they were defeated.

291
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,782
So what?

292
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,285
Perhaps they
lacked divine protection.

293
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,707
[laughs]

294
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,334
[YAMA]
Listen up, men!

295
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:56,131
We're up against 20 Shandorians
and seven Blue Sea Dwellers.

296
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,590
They pose no threat.

297
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,301
We don't need to trouble
the Priests with them.

298
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,138
Destroy them without mercy. Go!

300
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,605
[WYPER] If you can step over the
bodies of your dying comrades

301
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,775
and keep fighting,
then follow me.

302
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:19,320
Now. I swear.
Eneru's head will be mine!

303
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,202
[KAMAKIRI] Once we kill Eneru,
there will be no need for you

304
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:29,706
to sneak around obsessing
over a single bag of Vearth.

Just try using
that Reject Dial again!

309
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,650
You'll blow your body to pieces!

It's my body, isn't it?

I warned you we'd have to take
risks if we wanted victory!

them if we aren't willing

all standing around for?

We're in the middle
of enemy territory,

320
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,363
so let's split up.

321
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,824
There are still two Priests
out there left to deal with.

[BRAHAM] It looks like
they've changed the locations

of their ordeals.

00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:53,623
We can't have everyone getting
caught in the same ordeal again.

We have to be smarter than that.
