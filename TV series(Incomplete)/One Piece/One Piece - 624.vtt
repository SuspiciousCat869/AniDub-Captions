00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:00.252
Hey, why the hell're ya
pointin' yer gun at me?

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.388
Me? Why are you?

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:06.559
Get away! I can't
control my body!

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.094
[DOFLAMINGO]
I can understand Law,

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:11.764
but the Straw Hat are
nothin' more than upstarts.

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:14.100
[gasps]
Please! Don't do it!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.402
Why would you
bastards let them go?

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:18.604
Tell me where they went!

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:23.642
[MARINES groan]

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.519
Please, just let me live.

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.321
[yells]

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.089
Answer my question.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.424
[MARINE N groans]

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:39.792
Tell me which direction those

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.094
asshole amateurs
went or you die!

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.730
[MARINE N groans]

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.066
Stop! What're you talking about?

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.935
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hmph... Heh!

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:52.004
Fine. See ya in hell

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:03.682
That's enough.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.050
You messed with my soldiers,

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:07.219
now you're gonna have
to deal with me!

00:13:32.344 --> 00:13:34.313
[chuckles]

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:42.021
[MARINE O grunts]

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:43.856
Be careful, sir.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:44.890
[SMOKER]
Huh?

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:48.027
[MARINES grunting, coughing]

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.329
There you are, Smoker.

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:52.331
You should be able to
tell me which direction

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.200
those punks went.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.634
[grunts]

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:58.537
After we leave here,

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.974
I'm thinking about
heading over to Green Bit.

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:06.178
Nope. I've got no idea...

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.546
...Joker.

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.651
We almost caught 'em,
but they got away.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.721
I doubt base commander Vergo's
gonna be happy with me.

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.923
We both know that he's dead.

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.658
[growls]

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:24.096
[DOFLAMINGO] And that means you
know far too much for my taste.

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:25.698
Ha!

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.572
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.410

Huh?

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.434

[MARINE P]
He's outmatched!

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:28.661
The pink feathered freak
keeps hitting him

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.763
with all his weird ass
Devil Fruit powers!

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:32.298
[MARINE JJ]
Nah, he can take him!

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.067
Why ain't he usin' his club
with the Sea Prism tip?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.735
One quick stab
from that thing'll

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.704
shut down all his
Devil Fruit crap!

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:43.742

[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:57.623
[DOFLAMINGO] You don't
have what it would take

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.058
to actually kill me.

00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.962
[MARINES gasp]

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:05.164
[grunts]

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:08.133
Stop struggling and
die with some dignity.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.768
--Smoker!
--I won't stand here

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:10.736

[MARINES shout]

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:17.242
Oh, good, you're all lining
up for the slaughter.

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:20.312
[MARINES yell]

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.548

Stay back!

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:30.489
[MARINES gasp]

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:32.057
Ha!

[MARINES]
Vice Admiral!

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:58.283
[LUFFY]
So is Dressrosa cool, or what?

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.685
[LAW]
We're not sightseeing.

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.954
We have important
business there.

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:03.822
Wait! The Dressrosa?

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.958
[LUFFY] What about it?
You know the place?

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.426
Yes! as a matter of fact,

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:09.361
that is the exact
destination that we,

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.430
or rather, I was
hoping to reach.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:12.965
That is your
destination as well?

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.767
Sure! Or I guess so.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.036
You have no idea
what's going on, huh?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.237
Nope!

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.204
[LAW graons]

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:21.006
[NAMI gasps]

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:26.178
[NAMI]
Why is the current shifting?

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.179
[CREW shouts]

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.082
What the hell is going on?

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.884
[CREW]
Are we on a slope?

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:33.685
[LUFFY]
Woo-hoo!

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.389
[laughs] Oh, man!
We're movin' crazy fast!

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.458
Look out for reefs
while you're up there!

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.560
[USOPP] Can anyone explain
what's happening here?

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.662
[LAW] We're on a sea hill.
It's not uncommon.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:44.863
[USOPP]
Yes it is!

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:47.833
[LAW] It's best if we don't try
to go against the current.

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:50.069
The middle needle on your Log
Pose should be pointing us

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:52.771
in the exact direction
of Dressrosa.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.540
But don't steer us
straight there.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.375
We'll want to take
a roundabout way.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.543
[NAMI]
Why's that?

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:00.279
Just trust me.
It'll work out best for us.

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.915
Is this guy always such
a know-it-all smart ass?

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.516
Here's something
I've been wondering.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.786
I saw you talking to someone on
the Transponder Snail earlier.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.755
Why don't you
tell us who it was.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:10.923
It was Doflamingo.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:14.093
Doflamingo?!
You mean the Warlord?

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.662
He's the most evil one,
why talk to him?

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:19.431
The plan's in action,
so there's no backing out.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.433
What plan? Wanna fill us in?

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:23.469
Yeah, let's tell 'em
about the plan!

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.171
Gather round, everybody!

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.308
[CREW] You formed an alliance to
kill one of the Four Emperors?

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:31.543
Y'know, this plan?
It's pretty great.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:32.478
It's not great!

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.580
That's a super ambitious
goal right there.

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:37.549
Wait, wait, everyone just
calm down for a minute!

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.586
Alright, Luffy. Can you
explain this alliance to us?

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.755
Sure thing! Our crew is teamin'
up with Traffy's pirate crew

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.391
to do stuff, so let's
all try to get along.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.192
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.428
[USOPP]
All against this idea? Me!

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:50.762
--Me!
--Me!

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.431
Do you really think
that's gonna make

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.665
any sort of difference?

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:55.267
[USOPP gulps]

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.803
[SANJI] You know what happens
once Luffy's made up his mind.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:59.238
Thank you, Sanji.

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.541
I'll give ya a word of warning.

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:05.511
Try not to act too surprised if
it turns out there's a bit of a

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:08.714
difference in how you and Luffy
define the term "alliance".

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.415
You've been warned.

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.517
[LAW grunts]

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.685
At least the whole kidnapping
thing makes sense now,

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.455
considering it's
not Luffy's style.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:19.024
Usually if he'd brought this
weird sheep onboard,

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.360
I would've assumed he wanted
me to throw it in a pot

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:22.995
and cook it up for him.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:27.299
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs] Do you
simpletons honestly believe

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:30.002
that you're going to get
way with this madness?

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:32.271
You're about to have some
of the most powerful names

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.106
in the world hunting you down.

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.607
You pea-brained savages!

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.609
Your stupidity
will be your death!

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.411
There's a special
place in hell for--

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:42.214
[groans]

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:45.884
[CHOPPER] Not cool, Sanji!
I'm still treating him!

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.119
Wait 'til I'm done!

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:49.121
[SANJI]
What, and then it's okay?

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.791
You guys executed
stage one of the plan

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.928
when I asked you to kidnap
Caesar on Punk Hazard.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:58.163
And while you were doing that,
I destroyed the machine

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.533
manufacturing the
chemical S.A.D.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.368
Most of the great pirates
in the New World

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:07.606
rule over their own territories,
governed by their subordinates.

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:09.575
They've got a countless
number of followers

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:12.911
and they reign over all like an
enormous criminal syndicate.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:17.749
It's nothing like anything any
of you have dealt with before.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:19.985
Trying to take them down
with a single pirate crew

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.988
won't even get you close enough
to see their captain's face.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:27.793
With that said, they still
have to operate underground.

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.128
All of their deals are
carried out in secret.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:34.700
It's the only way they can
safely avoid Naval attention.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.435
And the most trusted among them,

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.304
the one with easily the
most power and influence,

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:41.406
is Doflamingo.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.642
His underground alias is Joker.

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:45.344
And out of all of Joker's
business deals,

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:48.714
he's got one client who's
more important than the rest.

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.782
His biggest spender...

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.484
...is one of the
Four Emperors.

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.620
Kaido, the King of the Beasts.

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:00.325
[LAW] And there you have it.
That's our target.

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.159
[MARINES gasp]

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:02.361
[MARINE KK]
Please leave him alone!

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.162
[MARINE LL]
He's on his last leg!

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.364
[SMOKER pants]

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:08.267
[MARINE MM] Ya can't take
him from us, please!

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.269
We're nothin' but
a bunch of misfits!

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:14.139
He's the only one who has
faith in us! We'll be finished!

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.842
Oh, don't you worry.

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.211
[MARINES gasp]

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:22.047
[DOFLAMINGO] Much as I wish
I could, I can't read minds.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.117
So every last one of you might
know more than you should.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.320
And not just you. Same goes
for Law and the Straw Hat.

00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:30.155
The whole island, too.

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.924
So I'll just have
to kill you all!

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:36.795
[MARINES gasp]
Really, that's not necessary!

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.967
Hold on there.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.535
[MARINES gasp]

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:45.837
[AOKIJI]
Pardon me for the intrusion.

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:47.606
[shouts]

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.679
[AOKIJI] I'm afraid I
need you to step aside.

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:56.415
[MARINES]
What?

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:59.318
[SMOKER groans, coughs]

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:03.388
[breathes heavily]

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:06.792
[AOKIJI] That man you
intend on killing right there.

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:09.094
He's an old friend of mine.

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:19.104
[NARRATOR] Just when the end
looks in sight for Smoker,

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:22.741
Aokiji, A.K.A. Kuzan,
intervenes and a new battle

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:26.478
ensues between the former Navy
powerhouse and the Warlord!

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.480
As tensions threaten to
reach a boiling point

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.848
for the two mighty warriors,

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:33.218
Aokiji causes a major stir
with a single utterance!

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.986
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.156
"Intense!
Aokiji vs. Doflamingo!"

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.892
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
