1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,700
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,336
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,639
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:47,575
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:48,409
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,345
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,946
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,883
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,752
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,420
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:00,922
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:04,259
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,862
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,266
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,335
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:18,873
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,412
[NARRATOR] Luffy discovered
that his brother Ace

54
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,582
was captured by the Navy
and now faces execution.

55
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:29,450
With the help
of the Snake Princess,

56
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:32,053
Luffy snuck aboard a Navy
ship bound for the prison

57
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,455
known as Impel Down.

58
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,992
[LUFFY]
The Friends' Whereabouts!

59
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:41,029
The Science of Weather
and the Mechanical Island.

60
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,801
[KUMA]
If you were to take a trip,

61
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,703
where would you want to go?

62
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:52,407
Zoro!

63
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:56,444
Brook, no!

64
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:00,782
Usopp!

65
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,355
[LUFFY]
Sanji! Franky!

66
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,523
[LUFFY]
Nami!

67
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:11,693
[LUFFY]
Chopper!

68
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:13,494
[LUFFY]
Robin!

69
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:18,833
[HANCOCK] Luffy?

70
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,672
It was a dream.

71
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:27,809
You were screaming.
It sounded like it was awful.

72
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,582
I lost all my friends.
A second time.

73
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,818
[HANCOCK] I see.

74
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,821
[HANCOCK] Surely there's
something I can say

75
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,723
to raise his spirits.

76
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,028
Hey, Luffy?

77
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,797
You don't need to worry.

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,866
Right now, you have
to put all of your focus

79
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,534
into saving your brother.

80
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:57,372
Have faith that your friends
can look after themselves.

81
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:58,873
You trust them, right?

82
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,543
Yeah, of course.

83
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,878
Now remember.

84
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,014
Even though you were
separated from your crew,

85
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,915
you have never been alone.

86
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,919
I'm right here to
comfort you if you need me.

87
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:13,788
You mean that, don't you?

88
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,559
Hancock.
I've been so foolish.

89
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:21,129
All this time...
I was with an angel.

90
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:23,431
And had no idea.

91
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:24,465
Luffy.

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,902
[LUFFY] Hancock.

93
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,509
[HANCOCK] Clearly, that's
exactly what he would say.

94
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,045
[giddy squealing]

95
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:38,012
[HANCOCK] No, we can't!

96
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:38,946
--Of course I want to,
--Uh, hey, Hammock?

97
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,949
--but no! We can't!
--What're you doing?

98
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,818
[NARRATOR]
Not long ago,

99
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,454
only a few days
before, in fact...

100
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,535
--[loud crash]
--[screaming]

101
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,937
Goodness!
What was that noise?

102
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,534
[HAREDAS] Be careful, now.

103
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,117
Well, this is new.

104
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:42,852
Are you finally awake?

105
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:46,155
[screaming]

106
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,662
What is this?

107
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:54,764
Who the heck are you?

108
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,165
And where am I?

109
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,034
Calm down, you're in my house.

110
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,302
I dragged you in here while--

111
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,137
[NAMI] You did what to me?

112
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,606
Uhh... I'm scared.

113
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,743
Your body's still healing,

114
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,912
so you shouldn't
move around too much.

115
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,314
And you won't get far
in this weather--

116
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,715
Just stay back!

117
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,150
I don't care what
shape my body's in,

118
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,419
I'm gettin' out
of your creepy shack!

119
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,321
My crewmates need me.

120
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,790
I've gotta get back to them.

121
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:21,791
Aww...

122
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,025
[NAMI] Back off!

123
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:27,430
[HAREDAS] Please forgive me.

124
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,132
I can't help
wanting to help you.

125
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,234
[NAMI]
I said back off, you freak!

126
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:20,850
[HAREDAS] Hey.

127
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:24,253
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.

128
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,488
[HAREDAS] Hey.

129
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:29,926
Hey hey hey, hey hey
hey there, young lady.

130
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,862
Young lady who came
plummeting out of the sky?

131
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,964
[NAMI] Yeah, I heard you. What?

132
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:44,173
[HAREDAS] Do you think you've
calmed down a little now?

133
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,243
No more inclinations
toward violence?

134
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,179
[NAMI] Yeah.

135
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:56,886
This is good!

136
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,955
Oh, it's nothing
special, really.

137
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,123
You slept for two days
after you crashed,

138
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,492
so I'm sure anything would
taste amazing right now.

139
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,328
Wait, I was out for two days?

140
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:07,230
Mmm. You really
must've been through

141
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,432
quite the ordeal, haven't you?

142
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,342
[HAREDAS] Ta-dah!

143
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:22,878
This may look
like ordinary rope,

144
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:26,015
but they are in fact
tightly wound Wind Knots!

145
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:30,219
If I untie one,
it creates a gentle breeze.

146
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:34,557
But if I untie two,
a strong gust will blow.

147
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,793
And if I untie three,
it becomes a gale!

148
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,129
[NAMI screaming]

149
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,330
What'd you do that for?

150
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,398
I'm sorry,

151
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,333
I just thought it might
cheer you up, that's all!

152
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,302
[NAMI] Oh, yeah,
I'm real cheery now!

153
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,204
I'm outta here!

154
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:50,106
[HAREDAS]
Don't be crazy, young lady!

155
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,441
You'll get yourself
killed out there!

156
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,216
This isn't so bad.

157
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:01,917
I can handle this.

158
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,121
[NAMI yelling]

159
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,267
[thunder crashing]

160
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,836
I know those clouds.

161
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,406
We're in the path
of a huge cyclone.

162
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,982
[HAREDAS]
Oh, no. Just look at you.

163
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:34,984
You've got mud all over.

164
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:38,387
Why don't you come in
and take a shower?

165
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,388
[HAREDAS] You get yourself clean

166
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,058
and I'll wash and dry
your clothes for you.

167
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,559
Listen up, old man.

168
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,261
[HAREDAS] Yes, young lady?

169
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,496
That isn't any
ordinary rain storm.

170
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,431
There's a cyclone coming--

171
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:51,500
A huge one that'll
barrel right through us!

172
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:52,935
Did you say something?

173
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,937
I'm trying to tell
you we're in trouble!

174
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,206
We are right in the
path of a gigantic storm!

175
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,508
Oh, yes, it's coming this way.

176
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:03,245
Hopefully with some
more pleasant company.

177
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,449
[NAMI] Geez. Dumb old coot.

178
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,584
Well I've already
warned him once.

179
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,321
What? Rain clouds?

180
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,925
[HAREDAS] Just turn the wheel
and hot water will come out.

181
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,526
Turn the wheel?

182
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,174
They're raining hot water?

183
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,676
How's this possible?

184
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,011
Is the water temperature okay?

185
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,447
If you push the wheel,
it'll blow hot air.

186
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:48,657
I made tea while you bathed.

187
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,393
Oh. Thanks.

188
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:56,198
--Ahh, that's nice.
--Ahh, that's nice.

189
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,533
Wait! Why are we so calm?

190
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:00,002
That giant storm is
going to wreck this place!

191
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,670
Unlike you,
I'm too young to die!

192
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:04,540
Oh, please don't start
throwing objects at me!

193
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,218
There's really
nothing we can do?

194
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,221
Oh, yes. It's time.

195
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,689
I'll be back
before you know it.

196
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,726
You just stay inside and
wait here, okay, young lady?

197
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,328
[NAMI] What? Hey! No!

198
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,501
Wait!

199
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:38,274
[NAMI] How is he able to
walk so easily in this weather?

200
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:50,486
[NAMI] There it is!

201
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,236
Now Cool Ball!

202
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:10,673
[NAMI]
Heat Ball!

203
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:23,519
Here we go!

204
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:27,356
Cyclone Burst!

205
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:48,577
[NAMI screams]

206
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,131
Well, damn.

207
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,816
[HAREDAS]
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey!

208
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,787
Hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey!

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,523
Hey there, I'm talking
to you, young lady.

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,127
You don't say.

211
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,562
Okay, what's up?

212
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,364
Well, now.

213
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,832
I only showed it
to you the one time

214
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,335
and you're using
the Wind Knot like a pro.

215
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,170
You're quite impressive.

216
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:48,871
[NAMI laughs]

217
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,272
[NAMI] Nothing to it.

218
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,675
Anyway, looks like
it's time for me to go.

219
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,213
Wow. This is a surprise.

220
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:59,381
Are those...

221
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,849
Where are we?

222
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,459
[HAREDAS] This is a small
Sky Island, called Weatheria.

223
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,828
We conduct studies
of the weather here.

224
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,431
[NAMI]
What? This is a Sky Island?

225
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,700
That cyclone looked
like it had the possibility

226
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,768
to be a rather
intriguing specimen.

227
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:22,538
But it just suddenly
up and disappeared on us.

228
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,807
Now I wonder how
that could've happened?

229
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,910
[NARRATOR]
And so Nami found herself

230
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:30,279
on a small
island in the sky.

231
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:35,309
Will she ever be able to find
her way back to her friends?

232
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,173
The storm is only getting worse.

233
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,375
Why don't we take a
break somewhere, Kitton?

234
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,443
Okay.

235
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,780
[growling]

236
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,249
Is something wrong, Taroimo?

237
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,283
Ahh!

238
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,354
It's... huge!

239
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,222
Get behind me, Kitton!

240
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,226
[growling]

241
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,300
[FRANKY yelling]

242
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,903
Hold on, wait!

243
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,871
What are you doing?

244
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:05,708
[FRANKY] Augh! Come on!

245
00:17:05,741 --> 00:17:07,309
No! Stop!

246
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:11,847
[KITTON] What? He's a human?

247
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:18,787
This is terrible,
what are we gonna do?

248
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,590
Um... Excuse me,
are you all right, sir?

249
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,660
My dog. He thought you were
something we're hunting.

250
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:26,962
Yeah, no biggie.

251
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:30,466
Ahh! It's like this
guy doesn't even care!

252
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,634
Hm... No harm done, then.

253
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,670
I bet you're relieved, Taroimo.

254
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,973
There is one problem, though.

255
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:41,009
Where the heck am I
and how did I get here?

256
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:43,979
It's cold. Damn!
Don't you have the sun here?

257
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,682
Ah... ah... ah-ch-Franky!

258
00:17:46,715 --> 00:17:47,716
Oh, no!

259
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,852
He's only wearing
underwear in all this snow!

260
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,954
Did bandits steal your pants?

261
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,324
Why don't you
put on this fur pelt?

262
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,625
Whoa, a fur pelt?

263
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,528
No thanks, I'm trying
to maintain a style here!

264
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,530
That'd cramp my reputation...

265
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:02,931
...as a freak!

266
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,534
Oh! I gotta move, man!

267
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,337
Like this! Wow!

268
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,672
C'mon! Follow my lead!

269
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,276
[FRANKY]
Shake your hips to the right!

270
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,647
Right hand to the waist.

271
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,983
And then stick out
your left hand!

272
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,787
Now slide and reverse!

273
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,324
[FRANKY] Right, left, right,
left, right, left, right, left!

274
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,959
Now repeat after me, guys.

275
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:32,995
One, two, one, two! One, two!

276
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,332
Right, left, right, left,
right, left, right, left

277
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,367
right, left!

278
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,537
One, two,
one, two, one, two!

279
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,741
Right, left, right, left,
right, left, right, left!

280
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:48,310
Wow!
One, two, one, two!

281
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,678
Haha!

282
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:55,984
[FRANKY] Super!

283
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,886
That's how it's done!

284
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,563
Crap! I'm still freezing!

285
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,865
Where the hell is this place?

286
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,100
[KITTON] What?
You don't know where you are?

287
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,570
[FRANKY] Why would I
know something like that?

288
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,104
This is the
Future Land Baldimore,

289
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,473
which is located
on Mechanical Island.

290
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,642
It's known as the
birthplace of the genius.

291
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:21,710
The what now?

292
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,845
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
The genius.

293
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,415
[FRANKY] The... The who?

294
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,749
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
The genius.

295
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:32,855
[KITTON]
Mister!

296
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,623
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Oh, my!

297
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,358
He really should've
taken the pelt.

298
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,926
We better get him
to the hospital, Kitton.

299
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,361
[KITTON] Yeah.

300
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:10,092
[SURGEON 418A]
Well, he's definitely a cyborg.

301
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,694
[SURGEON 418B]
I can't believe he runs on cola.

302
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:13,862
[SURGEON 418C]
What should we do?

303
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:17,099
We don't have any
sodas to refuel him.

304
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,667
[SURGEON 418B]
There's no time to lose.

305
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,768
We need to begin.

306
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,802
[SURGEON 418A] Right.

307
00:20:58,573 --> 00:20:59,942
Hey, mister!

308
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,514
You seem different.

309
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:13,488
Hello. You're the young
lad from earlier, correct?

310
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,625
I do hope that I haven't
kept you waiting for too long.

311
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:19,828
Yeah, you're
definitely different.

312
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,596
What did they do to you?

313
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,533
[FRANKY] Well it seems that
cola is hard to come by here,

314
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,536
so they brewed up
some fine hot tea instead.

315
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,604
Darjeeling, to be precise.

316
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:31,106
Hot tea?

317
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,982
The aroma and
flavor are truly super.

318
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:47,055
Lovely. There's really
nothing quite so relaxing.

319
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:50,492
Okay. If you say so.

320
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:52,594
I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

321
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,001
[FRANKY]
Enjoy. Careful, it's hot.

322
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:09,011
No, no, this is weird!
It's all wrong!

323
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:10,879
Hey, Mister!
You're not funny now.

324
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,714
I liked you more
the way you were!

325
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,816
Oh? Is that so?

326
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,651
What was I like before,
pray tell?

327
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,086
You were like this!

328
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,157
Super!

329
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,068
You know, lad...

330
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,002
That's just a tad embarrassing.

331
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:37,005
We need to get you
some cola right away!

332
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,274
[NARRATOR] And so Franky
became a gentleman

333
00:22:39,307 --> 00:22:41,209
on Mechanical Island.

334
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,879
Will he ever be
a super freak again?

335
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,680
And what does fate have in store

336
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:49,518
for the rest of the Straw Hats
scattered around the globe?

337
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,678
[NARRATOR] Chopper awakens
on a faraway island,

338
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:19,614
only to be attacked by
giant birds and natives

339
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,216
hungry for a reindeer dinner.

340
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:24,886
Meanwhile, Sanji finds himself
in a peach-colored paradise.

341
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,755
The inhabitants seem
harmless enough,

342
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,257
but is Sanji
walking into a trap?

343
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,959
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

344
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,294
The Friends' Whereabouts!

345
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,363
An Island of Giant Birds
and a Pink Paradise!

346
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:37,866
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
