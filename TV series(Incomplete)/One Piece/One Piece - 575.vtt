WEBVTT

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.020
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.090
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.860
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.030
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.330
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.330
You can have it!

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.270
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.470
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.310
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.980
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:41.876
The time has come.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:01.266
Finally, the end of the
Great Pirate Era is approaching.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.336
Good riddance.

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:11.876
Soon, Master Z!

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:17.516
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, the Straw Hat Pirates

00:03:17.516 --> 00:03:18.886
have left Fishman Island

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:21.216
and are making their ascent
into the New World.

00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:31.296
[LUFFY]
"Z's Ambition!

00:03:31.296 --> 00:03:32.766
Lily the Little Giant!"

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.806
What's the Navy doing here?

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:40.436
And there's a
buttload of 'em, too!

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:43.476
Worst of all, they've got us
surrounded from every side!

00:03:43.476 --> 00:03:46.306
All 360 degrees!

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:47.746
I'm not surprised.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:49.446
Nothing gets past the Navy.

00:03:49.446 --> 00:03:50.876
They see our every move.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.146
Guess we'll be fighting
for our lives again.

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:54.886
They'll chase us to
the gates of hell.

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:57.386
You guys are way
too calm right now!

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:59.086
This weather.

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:00.956
[CHOPPER]
They're getting closer to us!

00:04:00.956 --> 00:04:03.256
What's the plan, Luffy?

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.666
Hang on. Wasn't he right there?

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.326
[LUFFY chuckling]

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:13.266
Don't back down!

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:16.776
They don't scare me!

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.136
Straight ahead!

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:19.746
Push through!

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:21.646
Let's go!

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:23.246
Are you nuts?
There's too many!

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.446
Less whining,
more ass-kicking, right?

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:27.416
You heard the boss!
Get ready to fire!

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:30.416
Chopper, go fill
the tank with cola!

00:04:30.416 --> 00:04:32.526
Sure, whatever,
I'm gonna die anyway!

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:34.186
Leave the ones
in the front to me!

00:04:34.186 --> 00:04:36.126
We'll take the ones
on the sides!

00:04:36.126 --> 00:04:37.496
I can handle the back!

00:04:37.496 --> 00:04:38.966
Let's do this!

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:40.266
Okay, all set!

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:41.326
[NAMI]
Wait, Usopp!

00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:42.696
[USOPP grunts]

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:44.266
We don't have to fight them.

00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:45.336
Are you sure?

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:46.506
Third Gear!

00:04:48.706 --> 00:04:52.646
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Giant Pistol!

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:57.046
[ROBIN] The ships are
vanishing into thin air!

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.986
[CHOPPER]
And the rain stopped!

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:00.046
[NAMI]
Thought so.

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:01.316
I'm confused.

00:05:01.316 --> 00:05:04.816
What we saw was a kind of mirage
that only happens in this area.

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:05.726
Oh, really?

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.226
That's good.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:09.796
[NAMI]
Don't let your guard down.

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:11.696
If I'm right, then...

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:13.826
[gasps] Then that wasn't all!

00:05:15.536 --> 00:05:17.336
No way!

00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:21.566
[GROUP]
Giant raindrops!

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:24.576
[CHOPPER]
What's with this weather?

00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:27.176
[NAMI] Maubeugemour Sea
always has bad weather!

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:28.916
"Meat galore"?

00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:30.516
No, "Maubeugemour"!

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:32.646
Also called
"The Ill-Tempered Sea"!

00:05:32.646 --> 00:05:34.516
This place has every
kind of terrible weather

00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:35.586
you can think of,

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.986
and even a few you'd
never know existed at all!

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:39.156
Chopper...

00:05:39.156 --> 00:05:40.926
[CHOPPER yells]

00:05:40.926 --> 00:05:42.026
Is that hail?

00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:43.896
Yeah, I'd say that's
pretty ill-tempered.

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.156
[GROUP yells]

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:46.726
[CHOPPER]
It's big too!

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:50.336
Three-sixty Caliber... Phoenix!

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.066
[CHOPPER yells]

00:05:55.066 --> 00:05:57.376
Ooh, cotton candy!

00:05:57.376 --> 00:05:59.876
[USOPP]
A sky avalanche, of course!

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:02.176
All right, Mil Fleurs!

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:03.716
Gigantesco Mano!

00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:06.946
[USOPP]
Nice one, Robin!

00:06:06.946 --> 00:06:08.286
[laughs]

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.386
Okay, now it's just
raining like normal.

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:14.056
Oh, that doesn't seem so ba--

00:06:14.056 --> 00:06:15.286
[NAMI yells]

00:06:16.456 --> 00:06:18.726
What's gonna happen to us now?

00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:20.626
[USOPP]
I don't believe this.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:23.596
[GROUPI]
The ocean split in half!

00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:25.296
[FRANKY]
What the hell, man!

00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:27.266
Does this count as
sinking, or what?

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.976
I think we're about to end up
in the deep sea again!

00:06:29.976 --> 00:06:30.806
No.

00:06:30.806 --> 00:06:33.206
We'll probably hit a rock
and die before that.

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:35.716
[USOPP]
Like I said, way too calm!

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:37.546
Well, this is pretty awesome.

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.546
There's no time
to be impressed, Luffy!

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:41.286
Yeah, how do we get away?

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:42.156
Stretch out.

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:43.916
--Cut.
--Kick.

00:06:43.916 --> 00:06:45.786
Does anybody have a real plan?

00:06:45.786 --> 00:06:48.126
[FRANKY]
The Sunny's got your back, bro!

00:06:48.126 --> 00:06:52.396
Coup... de Burst!

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:56.936
[chuckles]

00:06:58.296 --> 00:06:59.436
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:07:00.736 --> 00:07:01.906
Thanks, Franky!

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:07.474
[ALL yell]

00:07:14.712 --> 00:07:17.182
[CHOPPER]
Now we get roasted alive?

00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:18.382
[LUFFY groans]

00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:20.082
I'll take the "alive" part.

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:21.452
I'm impressed.

00:07:21.452 --> 00:07:24.192
You sure know a lot about
the weather here, Nami.

00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:25.352
It's no big deal.

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:26.752
I've learned as much
as I could about

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:28.722
the New World for
the past two years.

00:07:28.722 --> 00:07:31.232
I could really use
a cold beer right now.

00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:32.232
And I'm hungry!

00:07:32.232 --> 00:07:33.632
Yeah, me too.

00:07:33.632 --> 00:07:35.062
Oh, yeah, that's right!

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.102
We caught a huge
fish back there!

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:38.572
[cheering]

00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:39.902
[SANJI]
I hate to break it to you,

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:42.902
but it looks like most of it
got ruined in the storm.

00:07:42.902 --> 00:07:44.042
There's not much left.

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:45.142
[GROUP]
What?!

00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:47.612
Don't worry though, I had
already set some aside.

00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:50.042
I'll whip us up something good.
I just need a sec.

00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:57.122
Let's see, we'll start things
off with a little carpaccio.

00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.392
Then for the soup,

00:07:58.392 --> 00:08:01.162
I'll make a deep-sea
fish bouillabaisse.

00:08:01.162 --> 00:08:02.722
Now, what about the main dish?

00:08:04.462 --> 00:08:05.732
[SANJI]
Food's ready!

00:08:05.732 --> 00:08:06.832
Come and get it.

00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:08.502
[GROUP]
All right!

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:10.132
[SANJI]
Hmm, looks pretty good!

00:08:10.132 --> 00:08:13.672
Let's eat! Let's eat!
Let's eat! Let's eat!

00:08:17.112 --> 00:08:19.012
[SANJI]
The first course is carpaccio.

00:08:19.012 --> 00:08:20.742
Go ahead. Eat up.

00:08:20.742 --> 00:08:22.242
Hey, where'd you put it?

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:23.952
It's right in
front of your face.

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:26.912
Oh, ha ha, very funny,
now where's the grub?

00:08:26.912 --> 00:08:30.252
What the hell are you
talking abo-- Hey!

00:08:30.252 --> 00:08:31.922
But I... Hey!

00:08:31.922 --> 00:08:33.292
[GROUP]
Boo!

00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:34.692
You just ate it, didn't you?

00:08:34.692 --> 00:08:36.122
Of course we didn't!

00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:38.292
Then who did?

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:40.502
Don't tell me,
the Maubeugemour sea

00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:43.132
is haunted by hungry ghosts!

00:08:44.532 --> 00:08:46.002
[LILY]
Oh, yummy!

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:47.842
[laughing]

00:08:47.842 --> 00:08:48.972
[CHOPPER yells]

00:08:48.972 --> 00:08:50.842
I was right!

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.512
It ate the soup too?!

00:08:52.512 --> 00:08:53.942
No way!

00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:55.682
[LUFFY]
Hey, what's that on the counter?

00:08:55.682 --> 00:08:56.812
[USOPP]
A bug?

00:08:56.812 --> 00:08:58.182
[CHOPPER]
A ghost bug!

00:08:58.182 --> 00:08:59.212
It was you!

00:08:59.212 --> 00:09:00.552
I don't think so, Luffy.

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:04.022
What the--?

00:09:06.452 --> 00:09:08.322
[SANJI]
Agh! Come on, really?

00:09:10.992 --> 00:09:12.962
[SANJI] Damn!
How hungry can you be?

00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:13.862
No joke!

00:09:13.862 --> 00:09:15.562
You're dead, ghost bug!

00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:18.332
[CHOPPER]
I think it just went outside!

00:09:18.332 --> 00:09:20.642
Oh, man.
I'm almost afraid to look.

00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:22.242
It ate everything in the fridge!

00:09:22.242 --> 00:09:23.572
[USOPP]
Wh--!

00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:24.812
Where did he go?

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:26.342
I can't keep track of him!

00:09:26.342 --> 00:09:27.712
[NAMI]
What are you yelling about?

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:29.542
There's a ghost bug on the ship!

00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:30.312
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:09:30.312 --> 00:09:32.212
And it's a dirty little
food-snatcher!

00:09:32.982 --> 00:09:35.252
[LILY] Who are you calling
a food-snatcher?

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.552
If you don't want people
to eat your food,

00:09:39.552 --> 00:09:42.022
then don't leave it
laying around!

00:09:42.022 --> 00:09:43.262
Huh? What's wrong?

00:09:43.262 --> 00:09:45.862
You're a rotten thief
and you know it!

00:09:45.862 --> 00:09:48.732
What? No, I was framed, I swear!

00:09:48.732 --> 00:09:49.702
[LUFFY grunts]

00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:50.672
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:51.932
[LUFFY]
Damn, I lost it.

00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:54.772
That little bastard's about to
eat us out of house and home!

00:09:54.772 --> 00:09:55.772
And booze!

00:09:55.772 --> 00:09:56.842
Oh, hell no!

00:09:56.842 --> 00:09:58.012
Where are you?

00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:03.612
[LUFFY]
Hey, you're...

00:10:03.612 --> 00:10:05.452
...a person!

00:10:05.452 --> 00:10:07.852
I'll teach you to steal my food!

00:10:07.852 --> 00:10:08.952
[CHOPPER]
Found ya!

00:10:10.252 --> 00:10:11.292
--Huh?
--Huh?

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:14.522
[ZORO]
Damn it!

00:10:14.522 --> 00:10:15.722
[USOPP]
Franky, grab her!

00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:16.762
I'm ready!

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:18.192
[LILY]
I can't let them catch me.

00:10:18.192 --> 00:10:19.692
I've come too far!

00:10:19.692 --> 00:10:20.702
Hold it!

00:10:22.602 --> 00:10:24.102
[FRANKY yells]

00:10:26.372 --> 00:10:28.072
She's little, but she
must be tough

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:29.772
if she can knock over Franky!

00:10:29.772 --> 00:10:31.272
If that's the case,
then we can't show her

00:10:31.272 --> 00:10:32.412
any mercy.

00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:39.382
[LILY]
I've got no choice!

00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:40.982
I'll have to bust out
the Mini-Mini

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:42.452
Full Rebound on you!

00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:43.482
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:10:48.462 --> 00:10:49.562
[GROUP gasps]

00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:58.502
Hey, check it out!

00:10:58.502 --> 00:11:00.472
[GROUP]
She's a giant!

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:04.772
That is cool!

00:11:04.772 --> 00:11:06.912
What an amazing woman!

00:11:06.912 --> 00:11:08.442
And so cute!

00:11:08.442 --> 00:11:09.412
[USOPP]
Run!

00:11:09.412 --> 00:11:11.482
I do love a long-legged lady!

00:11:13.512 --> 00:11:14.652
This is bad!

00:11:14.652 --> 00:11:16.422
Stay away!

00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.322
No hard feelings, okay pal?

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:19.622
Oh, I got a few!

00:11:19.622 --> 00:11:22.662
[LILY]
Fine! Then here ya go!

00:11:22.662 --> 00:11:23.862
[LUFFY grunts]

00:11:23.862 --> 00:11:25.132
No way!

00:11:25.132 --> 00:11:26.592
[LUFFY grunts]

00:11:26.592 --> 00:11:28.432
Nice! Go get her, Luffy!

00:11:28.432 --> 00:11:35.102
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Propeller!

00:11:35.102 --> 00:11:36.372
[LILY yelling]

00:11:36.372 --> 00:11:38.442
[LUFFY]
Propeller Wind-down!

00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:39.872
[LILY yelling]

00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:45.012
Uh-oh.

00:11:45.012 --> 00:11:46.812
I don't think she knows
how to swim.

00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:49.822
Don't worry, sweetheart,
I'm on my way!

00:11:49.822 --> 00:11:52.022
Maybe she can't swim because
she's got Devil Fruit

00:11:52.022 --> 00:11:55.122
powers like you, Luffy!

00:11:55.122 --> 00:11:57.562
[LILY]
I'm so sorry, Dad.

00:11:57.562 --> 00:11:59.832
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:04.072
[SANJI]
She's... shrinking.

00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:14.212
[LILY]
Dad... Dad!

00:12:14.212 --> 00:12:16.712
I'll save you no matter
what it takes!

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:20.582
Just wait for me, okay?

00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:23.152
[LILY gasps]
Oh, no!

00:12:24.592 --> 00:12:25.922
[CHOPPER]
Thank goodness.

00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:28.762
She woke up.

00:12:28.762 --> 00:12:30.392
Are you feeling
better, beautiful?

00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:31.862
[LUFFY]
Hey, you!

00:12:31.862 --> 00:12:33.732
[SANJI] Dammit, Luffy,
don't you know you should never

00:12:33.732 --> 00:12:35.262
hit a lady?

00:12:35.262 --> 00:12:37.872
So you can make yourself
smaller and bigger?

00:12:37.872 --> 00:12:39.272
That's pretty lucky!

00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:41.002
--[LILY] Huh?
--[LUFFY chuckles]

00:12:41.002 --> 00:12:42.372
Uh, well...

00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:45.712
I'm a giant, but I ate
the Mini-Mini Fruit,

00:12:45.712 --> 00:12:48.282
and, well, this is the ability
that comes with it.

00:12:48.282 --> 00:12:49.542
You're a giant?

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:51.352
[LILY]
Uh, technically, yeah.

00:12:51.352 --> 00:12:54.522
But these days I pretty much
stick to being this size.

00:12:54.522 --> 00:12:56.952
I can shrink my height
down to 5 millimeters,

00:12:56.952 --> 00:12:59.692
or I can grow to be as
tall as any other giant!

00:12:59.692 --> 00:13:01.922
Whoa. That's a neat power!

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:02.722
[LILY]
Really?

00:13:02.722 --> 00:13:04.862
Yeah! And you're super strong!

00:13:04.862 --> 00:13:08.402
I mean, you knocked Franky down
even though you were tiny!

00:13:08.402 --> 00:13:09.862
That's because when
I shrink down,

00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:12.972
I still carry all the strength
of a regular-sized giant!

00:13:12.972 --> 00:13:14.242
Here let me show you.

00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:15.942
See?

00:13:15.942 --> 00:13:17.102
[GROUP]
Whoa!

00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:18.272
[LUFFY]
Woohoo!

00:13:18.272 --> 00:13:19.972
Must be nice to be so carefree.

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:22.042
He's already forgotten
about the food.

00:13:22.042 --> 00:13:24.042
Yeah, that's our
captain for you.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.152
So, what other fun stuff
can you do?

00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:27.582
Uh, well...

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:29.752
I do know one more technique.

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:32.922
I can crawl into somebody's
body, and then,

00:13:32.922 --> 00:13:36.392
when I start growing bigger,
they pop like balloons!

00:13:36.392 --> 00:13:37.992
[USOPP, CHOPPER gasp]

00:13:37.992 --> 00:13:40.632
Sweet, so I can turn
into a giant too!

00:13:40.632 --> 00:13:42.462
[LILY]
Huh? What do you mean?

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:44.832
See, Luffy's whole body
is made out of rubber.

00:13:44.832 --> 00:13:47.772
So if you did that
to him, he'd stretch.

00:13:47.772 --> 00:13:49.902
Wow, are you serious?

00:13:49.902 --> 00:13:51.612
That must be really useful!

00:13:51.612 --> 00:13:55.082
So what can I call you,
well, besides "babe"?

00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:57.282
Oh! My name's Lily Enstomach.

00:13:57.282 --> 00:13:59.612
But some people call me
"Lily the Glutton."

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:01.652
Guess 'cause I eat
a lot for a girl!

00:14:01.652 --> 00:14:04.322
Okay, so what are you
doing aboard our ship?

00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:07.122
It just kinda
happened, actually.

00:14:07.122 --> 00:14:09.122
I was waiting for
somebody out at sea,

00:14:09.122 --> 00:14:11.132
and suddenly, bam!

00:14:11.132 --> 00:14:13.262
Your ship just flew up
out of the water

00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:15.002
and knocked me onboard!

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:17.502
You were waiting for someone
in the middle of the sea?

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:18.632
Are they a fish?

00:14:18.632 --> 00:14:19.832
Nope. Just my dad.

00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:23.602
[screams]

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:28.315
Why am I still wasting
my time chatting with you?!

00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:47.003
[LILY yelling]

00:14:47.003 --> 00:14:48.473
Hey, what's the matter with her?

00:14:48.473 --> 00:14:49.403
Cool it!

00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:51.573
Your head's way too big
for your body! It's weird!

00:14:51.573 --> 00:14:53.513
The bottle's in pieces now!

00:14:53.513 --> 00:14:55.513
What am I gonna do?

00:14:55.513 --> 00:14:56.743
I can't believe it!

00:14:56.743 --> 00:14:58.153
And I had to sneak on
all those stupid

00:14:58.153 --> 00:15:00.423
Navy battleships
to make it here, too!

00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:02.823
I'm never gonna get back
to my Dad at this rate!

00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:05.193
Hold on, so you got separated
from him or what?

00:15:05.193 --> 00:15:06.693
Can you tell us
something about him?

00:15:09.163 --> 00:15:11.163
I'll have you know,
he happens to be

00:15:11.163 --> 00:15:13.463
the greatest pirate chef
in the New World!

00:15:13.463 --> 00:15:15.333
Your dad's a pirate chef?

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:16.703
What's his name?

00:15:16.703 --> 00:15:17.933
I might have heard of him.

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:19.703
Why, it's Panz Fry, of course!

00:15:19.703 --> 00:15:21.543
[SANJI]
Oh, yeah, everyone knows him!

00:15:21.543 --> 00:15:23.303
Wow, he must be famous!

00:15:23.303 --> 00:15:25.513
[LILY] He's a master
of volcano cooking!

00:15:25.513 --> 00:15:26.883
Volcano?

00:15:26.883 --> 00:15:29.213
I don't know what that is,
but it sounds good!

00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:30.553
Yeah, it's delicious!

00:15:30.553 --> 00:15:33.313
And now my mouth's watering!

00:15:33.313 --> 00:15:36.123
[LILY] My favorite is
churrasco sea-monster!

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.453
The seasoning's made of
rare herbs that only grow

00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:40.993
around volcanoes,
mixed with million-year-old

00:15:40.993 --> 00:15:44.733
salt crystals harvested
from between molten rocks!

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:46.693
Then he sprinkles
all that over tender,

00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:48.803
juicy sea-monster meat
and stews it

00:15:48.803 --> 00:15:52.303
inside a volcano till
it's roasted just right!

00:15:52.303 --> 00:15:53.503
[LUFFY]
Yummy!

00:15:53.503 --> 00:15:56.243
Think that's yummy?
That's not all he can do!

00:15:56.243 --> 00:15:57.243
Tell me more!

00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:59.843
[LILY] There's one recipe where
he fills a giant frying pan

00:15:59.843 --> 00:16:02.843
with delicacies from
the land and sea.

00:16:02.843 --> 00:16:05.353
Then cooks the whole
thing over the volcano!

00:16:05.353 --> 00:16:07.883
It's called a
Thousand-Person Paella!

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:09.923
Once you take the first bite,

00:16:09.923 --> 00:16:13.093
it's like running through a
field of flowers in heaven!

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:14.693
Only the field is the rice,

00:16:14.693 --> 00:16:17.933
and the flowers are all
the succulent flavors!

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:21.663
[LUFFY] Sweet! I wanna
go to flavor heaven!

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:24.873
Food of the gods! All right!

00:16:24.873 --> 00:16:27.703
Wait, I don't have time
to chit-chat with you!

00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:28.903
But you brought it up.

00:16:28.903 --> 00:16:30.773
--[LILY yelling]
--[ROBIN] Come to think of it.

00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:33.613
I've heard a few things
about this Panz Fry as well.

00:16:33.613 --> 00:16:35.113
Like he loves to cook.

00:16:35.113 --> 00:16:37.453
Especially for poor
and starving people.

00:16:37.453 --> 00:16:39.383
He's known for stealing
the ingredients he needs

00:16:39.383 --> 00:16:42.423
from other pirates, the Navy,
and even the government.

00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:46.093
If that's true...

00:16:46.093 --> 00:16:47.793
...then your dad's a hero!

00:16:47.793 --> 00:16:51.193
[LILY laughs] Aw, that's got
nothing to do with me.

00:16:51.193 --> 00:16:54.533
Ah! There's no time
for flattery either!

00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:56.533
[NAMI]
Forget that. What happened?

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:58.073
[LILY]
Oh, right!

00:16:58.073 --> 00:17:00.443
Well, Dad and I were
having fun pirating around

00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:02.543
together for a long time.

00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:07.483
But then, a couple of weeks ago,
he suddenly went missing.

00:17:07.483 --> 00:17:10.613
I heard a rumor that he
was taken by the Navy.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:14.953
I was asking around on
every island I went to.

00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:17.393
And then I read in the
paper that he was being

00:17:17.393 --> 00:17:19.293
sent to Impel Down.

00:17:19.293 --> 00:17:20.663
Impel Down?

00:17:20.663 --> 00:17:22.093
Why would they send him there?

00:17:22.093 --> 00:17:23.323
He's a good guy!

00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:27.333
That's true, but he also has
a 320 million Berry bounty.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.503
That's pretty high! What for?

00:17:29.503 --> 00:17:31.603
Well, he was stealing
ingredients from the Navy

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:33.573
and the government, remember?

00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:36.243
It started adding up
before he knew it.

00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:37.813
After he disappeared,

00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:40.743
I managed to make it
this far on my own.

00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:44.453
But the ship I was on got
destroyed in that storm.

00:17:44.453 --> 00:17:47.253
I was totally lost.

00:17:47.253 --> 00:17:49.753
[FRANKY]
You sure do love your old man!

00:17:49.753 --> 00:17:51.653
You're such a good girl!

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:54.293
Of all the rotten places he
could've ended up, though.

00:17:54.293 --> 00:17:56.023
Impel Down's really rough.

00:17:56.023 --> 00:17:57.333
I almost died there.

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:59.863
[LILY] Yeah, I'm not
planning on going there.

00:17:59.863 --> 00:18:01.363
But what about your old man?

00:18:01.363 --> 00:18:04.033
It's just... I overheard a call
back when I was hiding

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:05.373
on that warship.

00:18:05.373 --> 00:18:06.503
[MARINE A]
That's right, sir.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.143
We're travelling across
the Maubeugemour Sea

00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:10.643
with Panz Fry.

00:18:10.643 --> 00:18:12.613
The ship that's carrying Dad--

00:18:12.613 --> 00:18:14.713
it's gonna pass right
through this area!

00:18:14.713 --> 00:18:16.283
What? That's terrible news!

00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:18.353
I don't want to cross
paths with the Navy!

00:18:18.353 --> 00:18:19.453
Yeah, I'm with Brook!

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:21.683
If the Navy comes here,
it's not gonna be pretty!

00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.223
True, but I have to save Dad!

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:26.323
And I'll do whatever it takes!

00:18:26.323 --> 00:18:27.993
If they take him to Impel Down,

00:18:27.993 --> 00:18:30.063
I'll probably never
see him again!

00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:34.533
Catching that Navy ship
is my only chance!

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:36.533
You're serious.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.333
[LILY] I'm sorry for
bothering you guys.

00:18:39.333 --> 00:18:41.703
I don't want to cause
you any more trouble.

00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:43.303
Just give me an empty bottle,

00:18:43.303 --> 00:18:46.973
and I'll get off your ship
right now, okay?

00:18:46.973 --> 00:18:50.653
You should get out of
here before they find you.

00:18:50.653 --> 00:18:52.313
[LUFFY]
Lily.

00:18:52.313 --> 00:18:53.923
Look.

00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:56.223
I wanna help
save your dad!

00:18:56.223 --> 00:18:58.353
If he's the only one
who can cook like that,

00:18:58.353 --> 00:19:01.063
then we have to get him out
so I can try it, right?

00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:03.493
[USOPP] Besides,
your dad's a good person!

00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:06.063
I can't turn down
a chance to meet a hero!

00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:07.903
But why would you guys want to--

00:19:07.903 --> 00:19:09.233
[SANJI]
'Cause it's what we do.

00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:11.703
We're happy to help out.
Don't worry.

00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:13.403
Yup! Just leave it to us!

00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:15.343
I may be a pervert, little lady.

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.873
But I'm super dependable!

00:19:16.873 --> 00:19:18.173
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho!

00:19:18.173 --> 00:19:19.873
What better way to start off
in the New World

00:19:19.873 --> 00:19:21.613
than kicking the Navy's ass?

00:19:21.613 --> 00:19:22.883
Works fine for me.

00:19:22.883 --> 00:19:24.753
Indeed. This must be fate!

00:19:24.753 --> 00:19:26.953
I don't know. Are you sure?

00:19:26.953 --> 00:19:28.623
Uh-huh! Count us in!

00:19:31.393 --> 00:19:34.523
Luffy! Thank you!

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:36.023
But don't forget.

00:19:36.023 --> 00:19:37.763
After we save your dad,
I want some of that

00:19:37.763 --> 00:19:38.793
fancy cooking!

00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:45.803
Of course!
That won't be a problem!

00:19:45.803 --> 00:19:49.303
He'll make you so much food,
your stomach's gonna explode!

00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:52.273
[NEO MARINE B]
Shuzo, come in!

00:19:52.273 --> 00:19:53.743
Do you copy?

00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:55.283
Oh, the Commander?

00:19:55.283 --> 00:19:56.643
He can't talk now.

00:19:56.643 --> 00:19:58.283
He's very busy at the moment.

00:19:58.283 --> 00:20:00.883
I'll give him a message
for you, though.

00:20:00.883 --> 00:20:03.453
[NEO MARINE B] All ships were
supposed to turn out today.

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:04.723
Where were you?

00:20:06.553 --> 00:20:08.393
Are you there? Answer me!

00:20:08.393 --> 00:20:10.593
What's your location?

00:20:10.593 --> 00:20:11.633
[NEO MARINE B]
Huh?

00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:14.463
I won't tolerate
this game of yours.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.563
[NEO MARINE A]
Uh... Ain?

00:20:16.563 --> 00:20:19.503
[AIN]
I know you're listening, Shuzo.

00:20:25.143 --> 00:20:26.143
[NEO MARINE A]
Sir.

00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:30.683
We're on our way right now--
that's the best I can do.

00:20:30.683 --> 00:20:32.913
We will be arriving in
the Maubeugemour Sea

00:20:32.913 --> 00:20:34.323
soon enough.

00:20:34.323 --> 00:20:37.523
Why would you come here
by such a roundabout way?

00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:39.593
Obviously you don't
understand the urgency

00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:41.093
of this mission, Shuzo.

00:20:41.093 --> 00:20:43.193
I understand it perfectly.

00:20:43.193 --> 00:20:44.193
[AIN]
Then tell me why--

00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:45.263
Be quiet!

00:20:45.263 --> 00:20:46.593
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:48.703
[SHUZO] I have received
word that a ship carrying

00:20:48.703 --> 00:20:51.103
that arrogant pirate Panz Fry

00:20:51.103 --> 00:20:52.933
will be passing through
the area soon.

00:20:55.973 --> 00:20:58.043
If we let them take him
to Impel Down,

00:20:58.043 --> 00:21:02.213
he will continue to live,
and I cannot abide that!

00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:04.813
Every single pirate
in the New World

00:21:04.813 --> 00:21:07.553
must be exterminated
at all costs!

00:21:07.553 --> 00:21:11.293
As I recall, that's the
objective of the Neo Navy,

00:21:11.293 --> 00:21:12.353
isn't it?

00:21:12.353 --> 00:21:14.863
[AIN] Yes, but If we allow
you to do as you please,

00:21:14.863 --> 00:21:17.993
it's only a matter of time
before the Navy catches on.

00:21:17.993 --> 00:21:20.033
That means no more detours.

00:21:20.033 --> 00:21:22.033
[SHUZO]
Stop worrying.

00:21:22.033 --> 00:21:24.503
If we sink him along
with the Navy,

00:21:24.503 --> 00:21:27.503
there'll be no proof!

00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:30.973
Now, I am going to
pull off this operation.

00:21:30.973 --> 00:21:33.913
And once I'm finished,
he will see I can make

00:21:33.913 --> 00:21:36.643
a better right-hand-man
than you'll ever be.

00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:38.583
Do you understand me, Ain?

00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.253
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:21:40.253 --> 00:21:42.753
[AIN] I don't need to remind
you of the consequences

00:21:42.753 --> 00:21:45.093
should you fail.

00:21:45.093 --> 00:21:47.023
[SHUZO]
No.

00:21:47.023 --> 00:21:48.063
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Cuh-lick!

00:21:48.063 --> 00:21:49.263
[SHUZO]
Little rat.

00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:52.993
[SHUZO]
Attention, all hands!

00:21:52.993 --> 00:21:56.263
It's time to show the pathetic
Navy that the Neo Navy

00:21:56.263 --> 00:21:59.373
is the ultimate authority
on the high seas!

00:21:59.373 --> 00:22:01.673
Now prepare to surface!
Let's go!

00:22:01.673 --> 00:22:03.603
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:22:03.603 --> 00:22:04.613
[NEO MARINES]
Sir!

00:22:05.843 --> 00:22:08.243
[USOPP] Whoa, the wind's
picking up again!

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:09.943
Great, more crazy weather.

00:22:09.943 --> 00:22:11.683
[NAMI]
I think it's just fog this time.

00:22:11.683 --> 00:22:13.753
[BROOK]
We're losing visibility.

00:22:13.753 --> 00:22:15.553
It's gonna be a lot harder
to spot your old man

00:22:15.553 --> 00:22:16.723
in all this, huh?

00:22:16.723 --> 00:22:18.553
[LILY]
Yeah.

00:22:18.553 --> 00:22:21.023
Hey. Lily. What's that?

00:22:28.433 --> 00:22:29.563
[LUFFY]
It's the Navy!

00:22:35.603 --> 00:22:36.743
[LILY]
There's my dad!

00:22:36.743 --> 00:22:37.873
He's so big!

00:23:00.093 --> 00:23:01.503
Okay.

00:23:01.503 --> 00:23:02.503
You ready?

00:23:03.973 --> 00:23:06.103
Don't worry, Lily.

00:23:06.103 --> 00:23:08.103
We'll make sure
your dad goes free!

00:23:13.173 --> 00:23:15.813
[NARRATOR] Luffy and friends
begin to carry out Nami's scheme

00:23:15.813 --> 00:23:17.353
to save Lily's father.

00:23:17.353 --> 00:23:20.013
But when plans go astray,
our heroes find themselves

00:23:20.013 --> 00:23:23.653
engaged in a harrowing battle
with officers from the Navy.

00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:26.953
After the fight, the rescue
appears to have been successful,

00:23:26.953 --> 00:23:29.763
until a new enemy comes onto
the scene and attacks both

00:23:29.763 --> 00:23:32.133
the Straw Hats
and the Navy ships.

00:23:32.133 --> 00:23:33.933
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:37.533
"Z's Ambition!
A Dark and Powerful Army!"

00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:39.673
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
