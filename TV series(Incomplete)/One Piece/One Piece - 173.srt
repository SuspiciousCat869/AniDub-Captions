1
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,832
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,292
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,961
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,629
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:00,133
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,041
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,258
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,178
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:52,519
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,048
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,269
[ENERU] God only knows,
and he's not telling.

25
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:38,106
[NARRATOR] Attempting
to escape from the Upper Yard,

26
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,191
Nami and her team were
heading for the east coast

27
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,360
when Eneru suddenly appeared.

28
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:46,740
He attacked and severely burned
Sanji and Usopp, then vanished.

29
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:51,119
Ha! You can call me Hotori!

30
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:54,372
Ha! And you can call me Kotori!

31
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,916
[NARRATOR] As if in his place,
Satori's twin brothers,

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,295
Hotori and Kotori, appeared,
seeking revenge.

33
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,505
[HOTORI]
Ha-ha-hah!

34
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,842
[NAMI] I'm the one who
has to protect my friends!

35
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,179
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
the four who headed south

36
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,765
in search of the ancient
ruins were separated

37
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:15,393
after an encounter
with a giant snake.

38
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:21,733
Its descendants built it,
after the great city fell.

39
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:26,529
Shandora, that was the
name of this ancient place.

40
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:28,031
Who's there?

41
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:33,578
[LUFFY]
Where am I?

42
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:38,750
But you're in the dirt 'cause
I hate being told what to do.

43
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,126
I will survive.

44
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,795
You watch.

45
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:44,839
[gasps]
So careless!

46
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,966
[CHOPPER]
What a dimwit!

47
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,301
[NARRATOR]
Each has encountered enemies

48
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,762
and been forced to
fight for their lives.

49
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,055
In the most recent battle,

50
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,974
Chopper fought and
defeated the Priest Gedatsu.

51
00:03:56,226 --> 00:03:57,519
[CHOPPER]
My turn.

52
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:00,271
Cloven Cross!

53
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:10,615
[LUFFY] "Unbeatable Powers!
Eneru's True Form is Revealed!"

54
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,589
[SHANDORAN A]
You all right, Kamakiri?

55
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:27,924
[KAMAKIRI]
Don't worry about me!

56
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:30,135
Stay focused
on the surroundings!

57
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,346
There!

58
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,056
Look, in the clouds above!

59
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,183
I can see Giant Jack!

60
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:41,604
We're close to
the ruins of Shandora!

61
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,066
Eneru's got to be up
there somewhere.

62
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,277
[distant screaming]

63
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,538
[ENERU]
You called?

64
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,501
[ENERU]
I'm right here behind you.

65
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:06,880
[chuckles]

66
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,090
Did you want something?

67
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:15,555
Brave Kamakiri of Shandora.

68
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,974
Eneru, you bastard!

69
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:21,436
Have you forgotten to
whom you are speaking?

70
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,314
I am God, you know.

71
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,485
[ENERU] And I know exactly
what you're thinking, warrior.

72
00:05:28,568 --> 00:05:31,529
You're wondering
why I came down here.

73
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:33,782
Mantra?

74
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:37,535
[laughs]

75
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,079
[ENERU]
I don't need my mantra

76
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:41,664
to read what's written
all over your face!

77
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,709
[laughs]

78
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,628
But I don't blame you.

79
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:48,672
Normally,
I don't bother to fight,

80
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:52,676
but this time, I'm a player
in the Survival Game too.

81
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:55,470
Besides, I'll be
leaving this land soon.

82
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,889
I was just saying
good-bye to Gan Fall.

83
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,767
Professional courtesy,
you understand.

84
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,312
A game? A game?

85
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,356
I also don't need
my mantra to tell me

86
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,442
that you'd really like
to kill me right now.

87
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,612
[ENERU]
Very well.

88
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:15,782
I must admit you've shown
great courage in reaching me,

89
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,618
so I'd say you're
entitled to a reward.

90
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:22,789
Call it a display of God's
mercy. Heh, heh.

91
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:26,167
So, then,
I'll give you five minutes.

92
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,962
For five minutes,
I won't move a muscle.

93
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,463
[KAMAKIRI]
What?

94
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:33,466
[ENERU] I won't dodge your
attacks, and I won't fight back.

95
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,175
Fry me.

96
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,343
Skewer me.

97
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,053
I am at your mercy.

98
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:40,098
[laughs]

99
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,766
[KAMAKIRI]
Why, you!

100
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,644
[ENERU] But once
those five minutes are up.

101
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,647
You will know what
it means to face God

102
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:50,942
in the very depths of your soul.

103
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,945
[KAMAKIRI]
I've had enough of you!

104
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,992
[KAMKIRI]
Time to die, Eneru!

105
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:05,665
Ha-ha-hah! Ha-ha-hah!

106
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,709
Damn you!

107
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,546
You missed us!

108
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:14,758
No!

109
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,135
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
Ha-ha-hah!

110
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:18,803
[NAMI]
You've got to stop!

111
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,096
[HOTORI]
We won't stop!

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,806
[KOTORI]
We won't stop!

113
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,184
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
Ha-ha-hah!

114
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:28,229
I said stop!
They're unconscious!

115
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:29,606
[HOTORI]
We don't care!

116
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:30,982
[KOTORI]
We don't care!

117
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:33,193
[HOTORI] These guys
killed our brother Satori!

118
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,611
[KOTORI]
Killed him!

119
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:35,904
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
They must pay!

120
00:07:35,987 --> 00:07:38,698
Ha-ha!

121
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,660
Thanks for the charge!

122
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:46,081
[NAMI]
An Impact?

123
00:07:46,164 --> 00:07:49,042
[farts]

124
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:53,171
Ha-ha-hah!

125
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:55,757
I stored my farts
in a Flavor Dial!

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,634
Ha-ha!

127
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,094
So that's it.

128
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,388
They have four different
types of Dials they're using,

129
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,139
instead of just one.

130
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:05,350
[HOTORI]
Ha-ha-hah! That's right!

131
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,143
Axe! Flame!

132
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:11,356
Impact! Flavor! Ha-ha-ha.

133
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,358
You won't be able to keep track!

134
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,902
Which one is Hotori
and which one is Kotori?

135
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:18,029
[HOTORI]
What Dial is in which hand?

136
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,656
It's so much fun to guess!

137
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,574
[HOTORI, KOTORI]
Surprise Dial Illusion!

138
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,660
Ha.ha-hah!

139
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:24,869
[GAN FALL]
We know what they have.

140
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,329
There's no time to waste!

141
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:28,164
I didn't care which
one of those puffballs

142
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,250
was which in the first place!

143
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,293
Suck typhoon, boys!

144
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,004
[KOTORI]
You missed!

145
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:35,338
[KOTORI, HOTORI]
Ha-ha-hah!

146
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,215
[HOTORI]
You missed!

147
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:41,344
[KOTORI] Guess which
Dial's in my right hand?

148
00:08:43,471 --> 00:08:48,059
Ha ha ha ha!
I fooled you! More farts!

149
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,728
Were you expecting flames?

150
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:52,439
Ha-ha-hah!

151
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,983
He's going to ignite the gas!

152
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:00,905
Old man!

153
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,657
[HOTORI]
Ha ha ha-hah!

154
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:06,244
[KOTORI]
Fool! He's been blown away!

155
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,667
[BOTH shriek]

156
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,507
[GAN FALL] That was
a childishly obvious trick.

157
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,177
I'm afraid you
underestimated me.

158
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,598
[HOTORI]
Kotori!

159
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:29,726
[NAMI]
Return!

160
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,396
Cyclone Tempo.

161
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,782
[GAN FALL]
You, girl.

162
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,826
Retrieve my gauntlet from the
lower deck and finish him off!

163
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,535
[NAMI]
What's wrong?

164
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,745
Did your wounds open?

165
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:49,496
[GAN FALL]
Forget me!

166
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:51,122
He'll be back soon!

167
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:51,998
[NAMI]
Gauntlet?

168
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:55,502
Gauntlet, gauntlet, gauntlet?

169
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,796
Hey, what's a gauntlet?

170
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,173
[NAMI]
Oh.

171
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,549
It's heavy!

172
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,760
[GAN FALL] It's made of iron
from the Blue Sea World.

173
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:06,012
There's an
Impact Dial inside of it.

174
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,890
Use it as I instructed you.

175
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:13,311
Yeah, I get the idea, but
I can barely lift this thing!

176
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:17,482
[HOTORI screams]

177
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:20,026
Well, there's no time
to worry about that now!

178
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,820
First Satori and then Kotori.

179
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:23,947
You'll pay.

180
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,449
Now it's your turn!

181
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,326
[NAMI]
He's the one who uses fire.

182
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,621
He's sopping wet,
and the air is full of moisture.

183
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,874
Cool Ball!

184
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,336
[HOTORI]
Huh? What's this, just cold air?

185
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,421
Is that all?

186
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:42,132
[NAMI]
Yep! Cold air, and you use fire!

187
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,967
Are you mocking me?

188
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,635
Do you really think
a little breeze

189
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,846
can extinguish my Flame Dial?

190
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:51,599
[screams]
I'll burn you to ashes!

191
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,814
[NAMI] That hot air
flowing over the cold air

192
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,734
will cause the moisture
in the air to condense!

193
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,944
It'll form a mist!

194
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,531
Fog Tempo!

195
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,325
[HOTORI]
What's this?

196
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,369
There's fog everywhere!

197
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,371
I can't see anything!

198
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,248
What are you doing?

199
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,587
[HOTORI] What?
What is this? What's going on?

200
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,380
[NAMI]
I beg your pardon!

201
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:24,299
And Impact.

202
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,643
Ow!!

203
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,480
Argh! That thing
nearly blew my arm off!

204
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:41,358
What do you think
you're doing, you old fool!

205
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:44,110
The pain will pass, my dear,

206
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,780
but I must say, you were superb!

207
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,036
[NAMI]
Hey, yeah!

208
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:56,081
I protected the ship
and the crew!

209
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:17,477
[PAGAYA] Uh, do you mind
if I call you Aisa?

210
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,812
Can you really tell

211
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:22,440
which way the Gravity Blue
Riders' ship is heading?

212
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:23,566
[AISA]
Yeah.

213
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,026
[CONIS]
That's amazing.

214
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,528
Even from this far away,

215
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:29,906
you can hear the sound of
their voices inside the forest.

216
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:32,450
But are you sure
you're feeling all right?

217
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:36,454
You've been trembling
ever since we picked you up.

218
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,997
[AISA]
It's just...

219
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:41,918
It's just that I've never
ever been this afraid before.

220
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,670
Everyone's voices.

221
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:47,632
Everyone's voices keep
disappearing one by one.

222
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,095
[PAGAYA]
Yes, I am sorry.

223
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:54,097
We've got to hurry, Conis.

224
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,766
Yes, Father.

225
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:02,522
Hold on!

226
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,357
Where do you think you're going?

227
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:06,568
I'm sorry, but I've got
to locate Eneru.

228
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:09,320
You can't leave a lady
all alone way out here!

229
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,573
I already said I was sorry!

230
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,659
I must know why Eneru's chosen
to come down into the forest

231
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,203
and take a
personal hand in this.

232
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,039
It could be...

233
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,248
"It could be" what?

234
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,125
When Eneru first appeared,

235
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:27,422
he captured 650 members of the
Divine Squad under my command.

236
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,175
I don't have time
to explain my suspicions,

237
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:33,845
but I fear that my men's
lives may be in great danger.

238
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:37,557
No. This whole land
may be in danger.

239
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,767
Pierre, can you fly?

240
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,310
[squawks]

241
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,770
[NAMI]
Wait!

242
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:44,689
I'll leave you my gauntlet
with the Impact Dial inside.

243
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,232
You should manage just fine.

244
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:47,650
That's all?

245
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,988
Ugh! Hold it right there,
you, you heartless brute!

246
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:53,031
How could you?

247
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,616
And you call yourself a god?

248
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,575
Get back here!

249
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,203
Think this over!

250
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,088
[NAMI]
I'm gonna cry!

251
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:18,056
I guess the main thing
now would be

252
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,433
to give these guys
some first aid.

253
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:23,019
You guys are still alive,
aren't you?

254
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:25,522
Oh, Chopper, hurry up
and get back here!

255
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:26,940
[screams]

256
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,650
What? What? What?

257
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:34,739
[horn trumpeting]

258
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:41,204
Heso!

259
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,164
Conis?

260
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,126
[PAGAYA]
Heso!

261
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:47,919
[NAMI]
And her dad?

262
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,963
What are you doing here?

263
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:52,882
[horn trumpeting]

264
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,802
[NAMI] And would you knock it
off with that horn already!

265
00:14:57,637 --> 00:14:59,639
Let me go!

266
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:00,306
[PAGAYA]
Wait.

267
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,683
No! You mustn't go!

268
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,809
Let go!

269
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:04,019
[PAGAYA]
You can't go into the forest!

270
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,311
You'll be killed!

271
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:08,690
I promise we'll only stay
for a little while!

272
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,150
[NAMI]
And that's?

273
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,027
[PAGAYA]
Oh, this young lady is Aisa.

274
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,238
Stand back, you Blue Sea
devil, or I'll smash you!

275
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:17,157
I'm a brave warrior of Shandora!

276
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,074
That's nice, kid.

277
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,325
You wanna fight me?

278
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,702
Have a faceful of Impact.

279
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:21,494
[CONIS]
This is terrible!

280
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:22,537
They've been burnt black!

281
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,997
They need first aid at once!

282
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,790
[PAGAYA]
At any rate, I'm sorry.

283
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:29,085
Now quick, turn your ship up
the path we just came on!

284
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,714
We used a Milky Dial
to create a new river.

285
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,384
If you follow it, you can exit
directly to the White-White Sea.

286
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,804
Quick, before the enemy
realizes we're here!

287
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:40,847
Then shouldn't
you have been

288
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,058
a little quieter getting here?

289
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:45,518
Oh, by the way,
I almost forgot.

290
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,813
I brought something to give you!

291
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,815
For me?

292
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,525
A Waver?

293
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,777
I hope you don't mind.

294
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,570
I repaired the Waver you
brought along with you

295
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,031
when you came up
from the Blue Sea.

296
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:01,618
Please take it.
It belongs to you after all.

297
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,620
[NAMI]
Oh! Really?

298
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:04,496
[PAGAYA]
Of course.

299
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:05,538
[NAMI]
Cool!

300
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:07,540
Perhaps I should
warn you, though.

301
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,376
This is no ordinary Waver.

302
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,585
[NAMI]
Huh?

303
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,838
It's far more powerful
than a normal Waver.

304
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,715
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:58,008
[yawns]

306
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,592
[roars]

307
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:03,304
What? Oh, are you still here?

308
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:14,816
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,861
I guess I must've dozed off.

310
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:19,696
Is something wrong?

311
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:23,491
You seem to be
in pain, Kamakiri.

312
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,702
I've kept my promise, haven't I?

313
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,246
I haven't moved a muscle.

314
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:37,589
I can't... beat you, can I?

315
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:44,512
[ENERU]
No, you can't.

316
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,264
Do you understand now?

317
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,641
I am living lightning.

318
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:54,397
Try as you might, no mere man
can defeat such divine power.

319
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,191
Surely, as a native of the sky,

320
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,611
you've seen it flashing
in the distance, haven't you?

321
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,905
Since ancient times
men have trembled

322
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,531
before the unknown
forces of nature

323
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,241
and worshipped
them as God.

324
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,577
Anything the fools could not
understand reduced them

325
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,205
to abject terror.

326
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:12,290
No matter what
happens to mankind,

327
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,084
whether it's for
good or for evil,

328
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,127
it is said to be
the work of God.

329
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,174
It's inevitable.

330
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:23,301
Mankind accepts that
it can never defeat

331
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,137
the disasters of nature.

332
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,932
I'm one of them.

333
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,934
That's what makes me God.

334
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:32,936
Do you understand?

335
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,654
Oh, a Breath Dial, eh?

336
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:47,617
[KAMAKIRI]
Burn Blade!

337
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:11,975
[KAMKIRI]
I have to tell Wyper!

338
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,310
We can't win this battle!

339
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:17,772
[KAMAKIRI]
This is suicide!

340
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:22,277
Even if he sacrifices himself,
the Reject won't work!

341
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,238
[ENERU]
It's too late to run now.

342
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,032
[KAMAKIRI] We've got
to fall back and regroup!

343
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,534
Or else... Or else...

344
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,623
[ENERU laughs]

345
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,418
Did you think that you could
move faster than lightning?

346
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:41,546
[laughs]

347
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,673
Your five minutes are up.

348
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,678
And now it's my turn.

349
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:59,356
One million volt, Vari!

350
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:05,653
[KAMAKIRI]
Wyper!

351
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:26,716
[chuckles]

352
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,093
[ENERU]
Hmm?

353
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,763
Did you hear that?

354
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,521
[screams]

355
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,273
What? What's happening?

356
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,733
What's wrong?

357
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,360
[NAMI]
Aisa!

358
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:49,280
[AISA] The voices.
They're disappearing!

359
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:57,789
Damn.

360
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,001
I guess my electricity traveled
down the Milky Road.

361
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:05,213
Another twenty voices vanished
after that lightning bolt.

362
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,298
The stupid fools.

363
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:17,600
[ENERU] On Upper Yard, 81
people began the survival game.

364
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:23,231
Two hours have passed,
and of that 81, 56 have fallen.

365
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,779
[ENERU] Thirteen of my
Divine Squad still remain.

366
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:35,618
Five members of the Straw Hat
crew are still with us.

367
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:39,039
And seven warriors of Shandora.

368
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:42,417
That means there are
25 players still in the game.

369
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,463
That's a lot more survivors
than I predicted there would be.

370
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:47,922
No matter,

371
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,760
They'll all fall in their turn,
one right after another.

372
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:56,806
The only real question remaining
is, who will come with me?

373
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,523
This necklace is solid gold!

374
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:09,527
Does that mean the City of Gold
is here inside this cave?

375
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:14,115
[stomach growls]

376
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:18,912
I wish there was a barbecue
shop in here too, jeez!

377
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,333
Oh boo!

378
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,169
Where am I? Where am I?

379
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

380
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:33,510
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

381
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:37,514
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

382
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:41,101
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

383
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

384
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:48,900
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

385
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,986
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

386
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

387
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,245
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

388
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

389
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

390
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,544
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

391
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,462
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

392
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,215
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

393
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,633
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

394
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

395
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:19,347
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

396
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,182
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

397
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,020
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

398
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,189
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

399
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,831
[LUFFY]
Argh! What's with this cave?

400
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:45,957
Where's the exit?

401
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:46,750
[NAMI]
For Pete's sake!

402
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,834
What are you doing there?

403
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:48,585
[ZORO]
Gimme a break!

404
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:49,753
Did you get lost?

405
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:50,837
[NAMI]
Look who's talking!

406
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,755
[ZORO]
What?

407
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,798
[LUFFY]
Ugh, I'm hungry!

408
00:23:53,882 --> 00:23:55,467
[ENERU] Will any of you
people manage to make it

409
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,886
to the end of my
little survival game?

410
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,679
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

411
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:03,183
"A Mystical City!
The Grand Ruins of Shandora!"

412
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,769
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
