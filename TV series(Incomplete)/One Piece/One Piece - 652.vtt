My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.422
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.325
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.531
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.270
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:43.360
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:45.263
as the New World.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.775
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.044
they held.

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.289
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.132
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.671
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.045
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

[LUFFY] I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

Their current objective is
to destroy a man-made

Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:29.987
However, Luffy becomes
sidetracked when he finds out

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.424
that the prize at a local
fighting tournament

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:34.462
is the Flame-Flame Fruit.

[REBECCA]
My soldier. Please don't die.

I hope you die, Rebecca!

[MAN D]
Yeah, and I hope it's painful!

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:45.805
[MAN E]
You're the shame of Dressrosa!

00:04:45.838 --> 00:04:48.409
They should set you
on fire in honor of your

00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:50.380
pyro granddad!

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.223
[GYATS] Block D of the Corrida
Colosseum battle royale

00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:57.695

00:04:57.728 --> 00:05:00.200
And the crowd seems
to be showing a strong

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.540
reaction to the Phantom
Princess, Rebecca!

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.563
[LUFFY] Whatever the
old king did back then,

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:16.498
even if she is his
granddaughter...

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.670
It had nothing
to do with Rebecca!

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:23.914
Yeah. Couldn't agree more!

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.253
[INMATE B]
You're all right after all.

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:29.124
What happened
with her grandfather

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:30.828
was devastating to Dressrosa,

00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:33.032
but the real struggle
lies elsewhere.

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.571
As for us...
We love Rebecca.

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:38.511
She's our one beacon of hope!

00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.013
[LUFFY]
Beacon of hope?

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:43.119
Yeah. She saved us
from our despair.

00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:44.622
We've been fighting
as hard as we can

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:47.194
to pull ourselves
out of this pit of misery,

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.530
but to no avail.

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:50.166
All we can do is survive.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:55.210
[INMATE B] We ended up
like this because we weren't

00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:58.750
strong enough,
but she is one tough cookie!

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:02.858
Whatever she's up against,
we'll always believe in Rebecca!

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.134
[INMATE A]
She just needs to win this thing

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.773
and get the Flame-Flame fruit.

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:12.244
If she can do that,
everything'll finally change

00:06:12.277 --> 00:06:13.446
for the better.

How does that feel?

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:32.919
The crowd thinks
you're even worse

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:35.625
than that scumbag
Bartolomeo from Block B!

Ahh, he's just too beautiful.

Whoa. Did she die?

Well, if these ladies had
been his opponents,

he would have won
in a heartbeat!

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.731
He still has the look
that made him famous

three years ago!

00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:49.371
They never stood a chance!

I don't understand what she
did to inspire such hatred,

courageous enough to fight

Is Caesar that important to you?

I'll tell you.

00:15:22.845 --> 00:15:26.485
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:21.897
Hey!

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.900
The heroes have arrived!

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:28.442
I want everybody to meet
Usoland and Robiland!

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:30.714
Hey, Usopp! Robin!

00:16:30.748 --> 00:16:33.485
[DWARVES chattering]

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.309
Yellow Cub Squad
and Pink Bee Squad

00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:47.815
arriving from Green Bit, sir!

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:49.450
Well done, Leo!

00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.893
We're all ready, Commander!

00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:57.467
Listen well!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.840
My friends, this battle is
a chance for us to reclaim

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:03.547
our freedom,
and to restore the honor

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.817
of our dethroned King Riku!

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.925
[DWARVES cheer]

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.631
[TOY SOLDIER]
As you know, on that sad day,

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:16.105
Doflamingo took away
the happy life we all shared!

00:17:16.138 --> 00:17:17.908
We will never forgive that!

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:19.477
[DWARVES jeer]

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:27.995
For an entire year,
we've planned for this day!

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:33.773
Though our foes may be
formidable, we shall prevail!

00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:35.844
[DWARVES cheer]

00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:41.121
[USOPP] I'd better listen
to their plan carefully.

00:17:41.155 --> 00:17:43.125
That way, I'll know
just when to bail!

00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:50.774
Hey, Zoroland!

00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:53.345
We're about to take
a left turn up ahead.

00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.416
If you don't remember,
left is the side

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:57.253
you don't carry your swords on!

00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:59.658
You think I'm too stupid
to know right from left?!

00:17:59.692 --> 00:18:00.727
Yep!

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.773
You're not about to
fight just anybody.

00:18:06.807 --> 00:18:09.043
It's one of Don Quixote's
executives.

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:11.214
Her name is Giolla!

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.187
Her powers turn people and
objects into weird paintings!

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.724
It'll be hard to beat her!

00:18:15.757 --> 00:18:17.928
You really know
your stuff, don't you?

00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:19.832
She works with Doflamingo.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.136
I memorized as many of
the family's names, faces,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.976
and abilities as I could!

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:27.648
Especially those three.

00:18:27.681 --> 00:18:30.587
The top-ranked executives
who wiped out Dressrosa's

00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:32.424
army ten years ago.

00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:34.996
Trebol! Diamante!

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:37.367
And the big guy, Pica!

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.509
Those are three faces
I'll never forget.

00:18:41.543 --> 00:18:45.083
Wait, ten years ago?
But you're a kid!

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:46.619
No, I'm 27!

00:18:46.653 --> 00:18:48.823
Huh? How's that possible?

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:50.894
[KIN'EMON]
Huh?

00:18:50.927 --> 00:18:51.963
That's Zoro!

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:54.267
[WICKA]
I said left!

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.642
[KIN'EMON]
Sir Zoro! We meet again!

00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:01.381
Come over this way! Hey!

00:19:01.414 --> 00:19:03.119
How 'bout some subtlety, huh?

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:04.321
Who are those people?

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:06.158
They don't look too bright.

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:09.364
Allow me to introduce you to
Dumb-land and Dumber-land.

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:12.504
Whoa, really?

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:15.043
So you're on the
way to save Nami?

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:17.213
That's why she didn't pick
up the Snail!

00:19:17.246 --> 00:19:20.319
I knew I sensed
a damsel in distress.

00:19:20.352 --> 00:19:21.956
All right, I'm coming with you!

00:19:21.989 --> 00:19:23.660
[KIN'EMON]
But wait, Sir Sanji!

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:26.332
We have vital information
to give to Sir Luffy!

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:28.068
We mustn't abandon that!

00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:29.972
There you are!

00:19:30.005 --> 00:19:31.743
[SANJI]
Oh!

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.846
Violet, my sweet!

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.719
That kinda crap's gonna
get you killed, idiot!

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:38.724
Listen, Black Leg,
your ship's been hijacked

00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:41.094
by my colleague, Giolla!

00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.365
And they're making their
way to Green Bit now!

00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:47.741
[CROWD cheers]

00:19:47.775 --> 00:19:49.711
Well, folks,
the battle for Block D

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:51.983
is going to be
an interesting one!

00:19:52.016 --> 00:19:53.486
But who will win?

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.526
We'll see soon enough!

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.532
[REBECCA]
I can't let myself be defeated!

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:03.973
I'm going to win this fight,
get the Flame-Flame Fruit,

00:20:04.007 --> 00:20:05.877
and kill Doflamingo!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.388
I say we get Rebecca
out of the way first.

00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:12.824
[COMPETITOR M]
Yeah, sounds good.

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:19.204
[REBECCA]
This time, Soldier.

00:20:19.237 --> 00:20:21.007
I'll be the one to protect you!

00:20:27.353 --> 00:20:30.359
These people can't wait
to see you die, Rebecca!

00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:33.766
And if I'm the one to kill you,
I'll be a national hero!

00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:41.516
[LUFFY]
Hey, that's no fair!

00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:44.287
There's five people gangin'
up on her at once!

00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:47.962
Yeah. I know, but it happens
every time she fights.

00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:49.965
She's used to it by now.

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:52.638
It's always her against
a bunch of big tough guys.

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:54.642
She's usually the
only woman, too.

00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:56.746
Not just that, but everyone
in the Colosseum

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:58.617
wants to see her suffer,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.923
so of course the other
contestants target her first.

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.560
She's really got the odds
stacked against her

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:04.762
in every way.

00:21:04.795 --> 00:21:06.164
I don't envy her.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:09.370
[LUFFY growls]
Go get 'em, Rebecca!

00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:10.974
You can do it!

00:21:11.008 --> 00:21:14.582
If no one else'll root
for you, then I will!

00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:17.219
This oughtta be a fun time,
eh, Rebecca?

00:21:23.465 --> 00:21:25.202
You can attack too, you know.

00:21:28.977 --> 00:21:31.247
What, you think you're
better than me?!

00:21:42.437 --> 00:21:43.540
[COMPETITOR O]
Hey!

00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:44.508
[COMPETITOR L]
Screw you!

00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:45.543
[COMPETITOR O]
Damn it!

00:21:45.577 --> 00:21:47.213
--That's it!
--Gotcha!

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.219
That's not fair.

00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:52.123
[MAN M]
Don't be a coward!

00:21:52.157 --> 00:21:54.060
At least fight back!

00:21:54.093 --> 00:21:55.663
We came for blood!

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:06.051
You will learn
to defend yourself.

00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:07.588
My mother told me

00:22:07.621 --> 00:22:09.925
I should never hurt
others no matter what!

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:13.365
[COMPETITOR K]
That's it!

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:18.475
You can't just keep
dodging forever!

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.289
In that case,
you must protect yourself

00:22:25.322 --> 00:22:27.895
from those who would hurt you.

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:28.963
You're mine!

00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:32.236
[COMPETITOR M]
What the--?

00:22:37.046 --> 00:22:39.651
[TOY SOLDIER]
Stand up, child! Don't give up!

00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:43.191
Dammit, quit movin' around!

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.934
You're in for it now!

00:22:49.505 --> 00:22:50.673
[COMPETITOR M yells]

00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:58.523
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that was awesome!

00:22:58.556 --> 00:23:00.492
Go, Rebecca!

00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:05.537
I'll win this.

00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:06.705
I have to!

00:23:14.888 --> 00:23:17.293
[NARRATOR] The heartless
Doflamingo reveals the shocking

00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:19.698
truth to Law,
while Chopper's team,

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:22.370
after having been transformed
into pieces of art,

00:23:22.403 --> 00:23:25.577
attempts a last-ditch effort
to launch a counterattack.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.681
Thus begins the
intense final faceoff

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:31.655
against Giolla to rescue
the Thousand Sunny!

00:23:31.689 --> 00:23:33.392
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:36.832
"A Decisive Battle!
Giolla vs. the Straw Hats!"

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:39.671
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
