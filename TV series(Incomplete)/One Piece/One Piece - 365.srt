1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,824
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,493
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:45,165
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:50,203
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,139
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,509
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,745
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,382
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,351
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,655
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,090
Hey, look down there!

48
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,592
Someone else came
out of the building

49
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,661
and it looks like
Chef Curly Brows!

50
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,538
Damn it!

51
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,842
I failed her.

52
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,212
[LUFFY]
Moria!

53
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,516
[LUFFY]
Get back here!

54
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,452
Are you running from
your shadow or chasing me?

55
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,588
Giant monster me
is gonna be a problem,

56
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,856
but if I wanna get
everyone's shadows back,

57
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,626
then I guess I'm gonna have
to beat you anyway, aren't I?

58
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,228
So get back here!

59
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,369
Too bad!

60
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,706
But it looks like the
last laugh belongs to me!

61
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,774
She's still out cold.

62
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,710
I'll take her someplace safe.

63
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,546
Don't you worry!

64
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,749
It may be in private,
but we'll have our wedding yet.

65
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,285
My sleeping beauty.

66
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,491
That is not good!

67
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,559
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,228
Hey, Robin! Chopper!

69
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,397
We're in trouble here!
Big trouble!

70
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,766
The... the Luffy Zombie
has our faces.

71
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,002
No wait, I mean, on his arm!

72
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,838
He has our wanted posters!

73
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,581
What do we do now?

74
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,252
Aw man. This is no joke!

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,763
He's gonna hunt us down!

76
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,868
Show yourselves!

77
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:08,308
Come out, Straw Hats,
you can't hide from me!

78
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,009
C'mon Captain,

79
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,845
you're not gonna tear apart
your own crew, are you?

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,549
It seems he's
been given the order.

81
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,685
I just hope the
real Luffy is all right.

82
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,287
Don't eat me, I'm all bones!

83
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,356
Are we supposed
to fight that damn thing?

84
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,457
No way.

85
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,000
[LUFFY]
"Luffy is the Enemy!

86
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:37,003
The Ultimate Zombie
Vs. the Straw Hat Crew!"

87
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,525
Wh-Wh-what is that
thing? It's terrifying.

88
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,494
Of course it is.

89
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,862
It's a monster, after all.

90
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,833
Wait, is that...

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,536
[ZORO]
Hey! Usopp!

92
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,538
Is that you down there?

93
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,440
You hear that? What the--

94
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,342
Someone just yelled my name.

95
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:17,844
[USOPP]
Zoro!

96
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,012
What're you doing up there?

97
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,681
There's Franky, too!

98
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,950
And look, Brook is
with them, they're all safe!

99
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,684
[ROBIN]
For now.

100
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,518
It looks like they managed to

101
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,087
save the skeleton
in time, at least.

102
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,555
Nami, on the other hand,

103
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,023
I'm still pretty worried about.

104
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,607
Hey. You're standing
in my damn way.

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,041
And what're you
doing interfering?

106
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,477
What's gotten into you, Luffy?

107
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,063
[OARS]
Luffy?

108
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:17,603
I think I'm supposed
to crush that guy.

109
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,808
He's my enemy.
My name's Oars.

110
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,846
Hello there.

111
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:37,924
Really?

112
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,659
What's with the introductions?

113
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,194
Idiot.

114
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,796
He just says
whatever he wants, huh?

115
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,098
He definitely takes after Luffy.

116
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,000
Look at this.

117
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,102
That moron's picking
a fight with the monster.

118
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,804
That damn stupid cook.

119
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,140
Has he even rescued Nami yet?

120
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,608
Probably not.

121
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,010
I think he's in worse
trouble than she is now.

122
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,818
[CHOPPER]
This is bad. This is really bad!

123
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,119
Sanji's in trouble!

124
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,788
This is unexpected.

125
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,957
I was under the impression
that all they wanted from us

126
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,625
were our shadows.

127
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,627
But he looks more
primed for violence.

128
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,962
I guess they
decided they already got

129
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,130
the cream of the crop
with Luffy's shadow.

130
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,166
Scary. It's scary!

131
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,868
No way we can fight that thing!

132
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,704
Well I can't just stand back
and watch Sanji get slaughtered.

133
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,205
[USOPP]
Whoa, hold it!

134
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,474
Listen, we're just
gonna get ourselves killed

135
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,709
if we all try to get involved.

136
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,978
Sanji can handle
this guy on his own.

137
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,145
And don't worry.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,914
He's got a better
chance than any of us

139
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,982
at getting out of this alive.

140
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,252
How? His face is on a
wanted poster too, right?

141
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,187
I don't see how his
situation is any better

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,822
than the one we're in here.

143
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,657
And that's exactly
where you're wrong!

144
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,192
You're not
thinking clearly, Robin.

145
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,227
You've seen his
wanted poster, haven't you?

146
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,229
There's no way he'll
realize that's Sanji.

147
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,364
[CHOPPER]
That's true!

148
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,534
Sanji's wanted poster
doesn't look anything like him!

149
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,668
[ROBIN]
You've got a point.

150
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,836
I'd forgotten about that.

151
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,679
You look justa same
as your wanted poster.

152
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,514
--What?
--What?

153
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,183
That drawing
looks nothing like me!

154
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,686
What do you mean? It's so good.

155
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,022
Are your eyes rotting? Idiot!

156
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,092
But you admit you're
part of the pirate crew, huh?

157
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,727
[SANJI]
Yeah, what of it?

158
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,963
Then you're dead.

159
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,199
Oh, crap! Oh, crap!

160
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,569
Oh no! Sanji!

161
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,620
Wanna try me? Then bring it on.

162
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,549
Wait!

163
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,150
Moria!

164
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:55,987
Kushishishi!

165
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,188
Quit laughing!

166
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,558
Kushishishi!

167
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,493
Dammit! Stupid shadow guy!

168
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:06,697
Come and get me, Straw Hat. Huh?

169
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:10,067
Well, I'll be.
Who put this dead end here?

170
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,504
I finally caught up with you.

171
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,072
Prepare yourself
for an ass kicking.

172
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:17,675
I think you're the one
who needs to prepare himself.

173
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,510
Did it occur to you
that I'm keeping you busy

174
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,212
chasing after me?

175
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,280
All while your
entire crew gets slaughtered

176
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:25,049
by your own shadow?

177
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,785
Jackass!
Kushishishi!

178
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:28,953
[LUFFY]
Shut up!

179
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,422
My crew doesn't need me to
fight their fights for them.

180
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:32,289
Ya think so?

181
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,058
Then we might as
well keep this little

182
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,028
cat and mouse charade of ours
going a while longer.

183
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,564
Brick Bat attack!

184
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,135
[LUFFY]
Dammit!

185
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,370
[MORIA]
Come find me when you're done.

186
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:50,441
[LUFFY]
Gum Gum Gatling!

187
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,781
[LUFFY]
Get back here, you fat onion!

188
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,590
Master Moria! Where are you?

189
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:12,396
Everything's destroyed!

190
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:19,236
[HILDON]
Master Moria! It's really bad!

191
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,315
What are those guys doing?

192
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:32,416
How dare you!

193
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,251
You fugly faced penguin!

194
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,520
You're the one with
the fugly face, old man!

195
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:38,422
Cut it out, you guys!

196
00:11:38,456 --> 00:11:41,625
This is not the time for you
two to be fighting each other!

197
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,762
And how are you even fighting,
did someone command you to?

198
00:11:44,795 --> 00:11:46,697
It was an order
from Hogback himself!

199
00:11:46,764 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah, now beat it,
ya crappy bat!

200
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:49,834
Really?

201
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,635
I'm having trouble believing
he would give you an order

202
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,204
to fight each other.

203
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,606
What exactly did he say
when he told you to do this?

204
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,441
--He said kill the others!
--He said kill the others!

205
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:59,844
[JIGORO]
Now you're gonna die!

206
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,779
[DOGGUIN] Stop getting
in the way of my orders,

207
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:02,880
you wrinkled old husk!
--Oh, fine, whatever.

208
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:04,381
[JIGORO]
Stop not dying!

209
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,199
Crap.

210
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:24,201
He really did a number on me.

211
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:28,806
Well too bad, you bastard.

212
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,307
You were tough.

213
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,710
But you still
couldn't put me down.

214
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:37,381
I've been waiting so long
for this blessed ritual

215
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:38,649
to bind our souls.

216
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:39,416
Well then.

217
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,318
Let's continue
with the ceremony.

218
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:42,820
You may kiss the bride.

219
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,489
[ABSALOM thinking]
Finally! It's happening!

220
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,425
Perfect, I found Absalom!

221
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,693
Thank goodness!

222
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,230
If anyone can tell me where to
find Master Moria, it's Absalom!

223
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:54,665
[ABSALOM]
Here I come, my love!

224
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,600
Absalom!

225
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,175
What the hell is wrong with you?

226
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,943
You perverted degenerate!

227
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,278
He said it!

228
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:08,946
He said it right to his face!

229
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,382
Oh, no! He's gonna kill us all!

230
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,552
[ABSALOM] Hildon!
Are you blind, you idiot?

231
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,789
What's so damn
important, anyway?

232
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:19,924
Huh?

233
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:21,625
He's gonna let that slide?

234
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,860
Uh...

235
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:25,529
I'm trying to find Moria and
thought he might be with you.

236
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,298
Is something
wrong with your eyes?

237
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,799
You see any fatties in here?

238
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,202
[HILDON]
No, no, I guess not.

239
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,971
[ABSALOM] Well if that's all
you need, can you get a move on?

240
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,874
In case you didn't notice,
I'm sort of busy right now.

241
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:39,543
[HILDON]
Right. Sorry. I'm off!

242
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,412
One more thing. Hildon.

243
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,314
Sure, what is it?

244
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,616
How dare you call me
a perverted degenerate!

245
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:50,254
That was a jerk move.

246
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,889
--Now he gets pissed off?
--Now he gets pissed off?

247
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,397
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

248
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,634
Kushishishi!

249
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,604
Quit running!
Fight me, you coward!

250
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:11,609
Kushishishi!

251
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,612
Who was that?

252
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,315
You! Stupid shadow guy!

253
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:21,585
Stop running! Moria!

254
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,259
My body was not
built for this much flying.

255
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,094
It's him!

256
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:33,931
I finally found him!
Master Moria!

257
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,165
Master Moria!

258
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,535
I've been frantically looking
for you all over Thriller Bark!

259
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,371
What d'ya want,
Hildon? What's up?

260
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:41,205
It's awful!

261
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:42,773
That giant zombie's
out of control

262
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,975
and destroying
everything in his path!

263
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,844
He'll sink the island
if he's not stopped!

264
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:47,978
Ya don't say.

265
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,614
I guess you better hop to
and do something about it.

266
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:53,617
Don't worry, I'm sure
you can handle it. Later!

267
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:54,985
Master! Hold on!

268
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:58,822
Get outta the way!
Move it, move it!

269
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:19,043
Stay still, let me squash you!

270
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:29,762
Sanji, no!

271
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,794
[BROOK]
Is he an idiot?

272
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,831
Sanji!

273
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,690
[SANJI]
You punk.

274
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,993
Ya almost broke
my damn cigarette.

275
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,832
Alright, ya got your shot in.

276
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,333
Now it's my turn.

277
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,968
Sanji's okay!

278
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,770
I thought he was done for!

279
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,777
I'm not finished yet,
ya twerp.

280
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,650
[OARS]
Gum-Gum...

281
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,952
It's Luffy's move!

282
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,453
Oh, crap! Can he stretch?

283
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,722
Did he get Luffy's
rubber powers with his shadow?

284
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,558
...Sickle!

285
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,626
Okay, he didn't stretch,

286
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,461
but does it really matter?

287
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,630
With that strength and
with as long as his reach is,

288
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,565
it's basically the same thing!

289
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,634
He may look like a brute,

290
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,469
but he's got the
speed to back it up.

291
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,738
We better stay out of his way.

292
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,306
It's lights out if he hits us.

293
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,741
[BROOK]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

294
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,711
Oars.

295
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,380
I knew I recognized that name.
It's him.

296
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,517
The demon from the legends, once
known as the "Continent Puller."

297
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,588
Alright.

298
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,324
I've gotta admit Luffy's zombie
is kind of a bad ass.

299
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,367
Collier Frit!

300
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,680
Sanji!

301
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:04,416
How can something
that big move that fast?

302
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,524
No more fancy footwork
for you, ya pipsqueak.

303
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,363
Oh, crap! He's got him now!

304
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,639
Sanji!

305
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,481
[FRANKY] What the hell's
he gonna do to him?

306
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,050
No! Stop it!

307
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,718
Sanji, look out!

308
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,821
Alright, pirate! Squishin' time!

309
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,623
[USOPP]
Fire Bird Star!

310
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,902
[OARS]
Hot.

311
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,006
Ah, I'm... I'm sorry!

312
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,579
Sanji, no!

313
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,520
[OARS]
Tall woman with black hair.

314
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,955
And that's the
little fuzzy thing.

315
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,466
--No, he's coming!
--No, he's coming!

316
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,767
[ZORO]
This is bad!

317
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,470
Franky, we gotta do somethin',
draw him this way!

318
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,538
I'm on it!

319
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,773
I think this'll
get his attention!

320
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,715
[FRANKY]
Hang on! I got ya!

321
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,489
You guys get down
to the lower roof, fast!

322
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,657
One Gorilla!

323
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,892
Two Gorilla!

324
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,827
Three Sword Style!

325
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,130
Double Gorilla Split!

326
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,704
Now Gum-Gum...

327
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,073
...Volcano!

328
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,642
Zoro! Holy crap!
What do we do?

329
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,810
Even if that
punch didn't kill him,

330
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,646
there's no way he can survive
falling from that height!

331
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,851
C'mon, c'mon.

332
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,587
[FRANKY]
Take this, you monster!

333
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,489
Weapons Left!

334
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,893
He dodged it again!

335
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,228
How can he be that agile?

336
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,036
What's he doing now?

337
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,919
Franky, no! Skeleton guy!

338
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:57,956
Zoro's falling towards us!

339
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,525
Oh, crap!
He'll die if he hits the ground!

340
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,028
Cien Fleurs! And Spider Net!

341
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,069
I owe ya one, Robin.

342
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,104
Dammit.

343
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,946
[USOPP]
You might be huge,

344
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,881
but you're still a zombie!

345
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,217
Special Attack: Salt Star!

346
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:29,888
Taste good?

347
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,768
It wasn't...

348
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,902
It wasn't enough!

349
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,305
He's too big!

350
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,845
Now Heavy Gong!

351
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,339
Luffy.

352
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,975
You jerk.

353
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,848
[OARS] I don't know you.
My name's not Luffy.

354
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,053
'Member? Moria's servant.

355
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,821
Name's Oars.

356
