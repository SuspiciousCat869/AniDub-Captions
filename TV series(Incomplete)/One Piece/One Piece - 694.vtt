These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:28.718
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

and challenged all
present to a game.

put prices on the heads

It's just sausages.

00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:10.981
They're too long! Like noses!

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:13.854
I want something nice
and round! Like grapes!

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:15.189
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Huh?

00:13:15.222 --> 00:13:17.762
I'll turn you morons
into headcracker dolls!

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:19.633
Now go and protect the palace!

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.569
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A gasps]

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.546
[SUGAR] I feel bad
for the Young Master.

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:29.184
I'll transform
this whole kingdom.

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:32.591
I'll have to.
They can all be toys.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:36.933
Oh yes, and first I'll
get that long-nosed bastard!

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:39.204
And the rest of his stupid crew!

00:13:39.237 --> 00:13:41.510
If she uses her ability again,

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:42.712
there's nothing stopping her

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:45.015
from turning our allies
back into toys.

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:47.755
Then our work
would be for naught.

00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:49.291
This is a mess!

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:50.862
[KIN'EMON]
Is this truly as calamitous

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:53.032
as it sounds, Sir Usopp?

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:56.840
Last time, Robin, she got
turned into a toy by Sugar,

00:13:56.873 --> 00:14:00.279
and it was seriously messed up.

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:04.321
I didn't even realize I forgot
her until she was turned back.

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:06.927
If Sugar touches Luffy,
it's over.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.465
For us, he'll be gone.

00:14:09.498 --> 00:14:10.834
It's worse, even.

00:14:10.868 --> 00:14:13.439
Like your friend
never even existed.

00:14:13.472 --> 00:14:15.009
She can't do that.

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:18.751
[KIN'EMON]
A cruel fate. How awful.

00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:21.288
I will not let her win!

00:14:21.322 --> 00:14:25.597
Yes. Contact them through
Transponder Snail and warn them.

00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:29.103
I've been calling, but it seems
they haven't noticed yet.

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:30.440
[DOLDO]
The net-climbers are drawing

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:32.711
precariously close as well!

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:36.252
[TOWNSMAN 693A] Almost there!
God Usopp's gonna get it!

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:39.091
[USOPP]
It's not ideal, but here goes.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:41.696
I'll make a long-distance shot.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.833
You jest, Sir Usopp!

00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:48.409
How can you shoot
your target? It's too far!

00:14:48.442 --> 00:14:51.048
I can barely see
the palace from here,

00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:53.553
let alone someone inside it.

00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:56.659
Why, the walls alone would make
it impossible from the start!

00:14:56.692 --> 00:15:00.166
[USOPP] Impossible or not,
I gotta do it somehow!

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.371
Don't you worry.
I will assist you.

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:05.544
[USOPP sighs]
Because if I mess this up,

00:15:05.578 --> 00:15:07.247
Sugar will know our plan.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.819
And we are not
getting another chance.

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:12.758
Distance aside,
that means I'm gonna need

00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:15.363
perfect precision on this shot.

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:18.169
With your Clairvoyance,
track her down,

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:20.707
and tell me everything you can.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.778
Right. Got it.

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:25.082
Now, let's see.

00:15:57.213 --> 00:15:58.884
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.987
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Someone help!

00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:05.095
Halt!

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:08.970
About face!

00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:10.941
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Sir!

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:15.182
Huh? Why are we
obeying him? Stop it!

00:16:17.254 --> 00:16:18.422
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:19.626
[ORLUMBUS grunts]

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:22.564
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:44.575
[BABY 5]
Armsmorphosis! Flying Disc Girl!

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:46.512
[grunts] Gimme your worst!

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:50.486
Whatever you've got,
I'll accept it with open arms!

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:13.767
Hold on. You'll accept me
with open arms? Honestly?

00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:15.236
Huh?

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:20.981
I, the former leader
of the Happosui Army,

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:24.555
shall challenge you,
little brats!

00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:33.974
I'm no brat--

00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:37.213
Compared to you,
I'm practically geriatric!

00:17:37.246 --> 00:17:41.556
Geriatric with a capital "G"!

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:45.530
[yells] I am a grandpa!

00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:49.404
[LAO G grunts]

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:06.939
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

[CHIN JAO grunting]

[LAO G grunting]

00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.532
[GLADIUS]
Huh?

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.167
Wait a second!

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:40.908
[ROBIN] So, this is the third
level right now? Correct?

00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:42.310
Yes. Almost there.

00:18:42.343 --> 00:18:44.916
One more and we'll
reach the Flower Field.

00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:46.418
[REBECCA, ROBIN gasp]

00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:49.257
We've been spotted! Incoming!

00:18:50.293 --> 00:18:52.397
[BARTOLOMEO] Even all my
most elaborate fantasies

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.737
couldn't prepare me for
the real-life Straw Hats.

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.684
[ROBIN]
Hey, Rooster! Watch out!

00:19:05.023 --> 00:19:06.625
[GLADIUS]
Pop Baller!

00:19:10.266 --> 00:19:11.736
[LEO, REBECCA gasp]

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.205
[ROBIN]
Are you okay?

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:16.212
[BARTOLOMEO groans]

00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:19.251
This is the ability of
the Pop-Pop Fruit!

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:23.359
[gasps] I'm falling! Oh no!

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:25.731
My Yellow Cubs are down!

Robin!

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:31.609
[GLADIUS]
Rather audacious, aren't you?

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:34.347
Thinking you can sneak up
to the palace on my watch!

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.218
[CUB]
It's Gladius!

--[ROBIN] Diez Fleurs!

[ROBIN]
Rebecca! It's up to you now!

00:19:45.738 --> 00:19:47.173
Take the key to Law!

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.111
I can take care of the rest!

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:50.079
Robin!

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:52.551
[BARTOLOMEO]
I'm fine, too!

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.736
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum...

...UFO!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.629
[gasps]

00:20:58.381 --> 00:21:01.121
Damn it. If only I had that key.

00:21:01.155 --> 00:21:02.958
I could finish this, easy.

00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:06.198
[BARTOLOMEO yelling]

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.770
What's that? It's really noisy.

00:21:08.804 --> 00:21:10.874
[BARTOLOMEO groans]

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.650
I got sloppy.

00:21:15.684 --> 00:21:16.385
It's you!

00:21:16.418 --> 00:21:19.224
Mister Luffy! A miracle!

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:23.064
[ROBIN]
Cien Fleurs! Wing!

00:21:33.252 --> 00:21:34.387
[LUFFY]
Robin!

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.193
Luffy! Traffy! You're down here?

00:21:37.227 --> 00:21:39.497
Nico! You brought
the key, didn't you?

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:40.499
Give it to me now!

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.137
[ROBIN]
I left it with Rebecca.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.105
What?

00:21:43.138 --> 00:21:44.340
She's all right.

00:21:44.373 --> 00:21:46.879
She's headed to the
Flower Field right now.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.421
[KYROS]
Rebecca.

00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:54.427
[GLADIUS grunts]
She got away.

00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:58.168
[GLADIUS] Well, she's just
one little brat.

00:21:58.202 --> 00:21:59.672
Even if she makes it
to the palace,

00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:03.312
she won't be able
to do anything.

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:05.883
I'll kill her when
I'm done with you.

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:06.586
[KYROS]
Bastard!

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.222
[LUFFY]
I know you.

00:22:08.255 --> 00:22:11.228
[GLADIUS]
The name is Gladius.

00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:13.933
And I'm putting an end
to this rebellion.

00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:16.639
Rooster. Let's go.

00:22:16.672 --> 00:22:17.440
Yeah!

00:22:17.473 --> 00:22:19.010
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:23.118
Luffy. Traffy. Soldier.
Go on ahead to the Flower Field.

00:22:23.151 --> 00:22:24.087
Get that key.

00:22:24.121 --> 00:22:25.657
We can handle this.

00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.759
Yep.

00:22:26.793 --> 00:22:27.961
You sure?

00:22:28.696 --> 00:22:31.034
Rebecca's waiting. Just go!

00:22:31.067 --> 00:22:32.102
[KYROS gasps]

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:06.004
All right.

00:23:14.487 --> 00:23:16.559
[NARRATOR]
Clashing fiercely with Fujitora,

00:23:16.592 --> 00:23:19.030
Sabo tries to determine
his true motives.

00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.603
Meanwhile, Robin,
Bartolomeo, and Cavendish

00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:23.038
do battle with Gladius,

00:23:23.071 --> 00:23:25.042
having faith that Luffy
will push forward

00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:26.646
and free Law from his handcuffs

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:29.350
so that the duo can challenge
Doflamingo himself

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:31.054
at the royal palace.

00:23:31.088 --> 00:23:32.992
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.025 --> 00:23:34.427
"Risking Their Lives!

Trump Card for Victory!"

00:23:36.732 --> 00:23:39.805
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
