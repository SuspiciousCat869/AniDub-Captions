[LUFFY]
Really? I'll do anything!

177
00:07:38,616 --> 00:07:39,950
Well then, I want
you to come with me

178
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,119
to pay a little visit to
Buggy the pirate.

179
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,454
But first...

180
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,501
Why did you have to tie me up?

181
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,628
The rope's just for appearances.

182
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,129
[LUFFY chuckles]
Well, okay then...

183
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,465
I've been looking forward to
meeting some other pirates,

184
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,466
so let's get going.

185
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,968
Just hold your horses.
What's the big rush?

186
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:00,721
[BUGGY]
What?!

187
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:02,890
Are you telling me
the thief got away?!

188
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,517
[HENCHMEN whimpering]

189
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,644
[ALL] Please forgive us,
Captain Buggy!

190
00:08:06,644 --> 00:08:09,730
I've never seen a more
pathetic group than you three!

191
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:10,981
Time to die!

192
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,066
[ALL scream]

193
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,151
Captain Buggy, I have news!

194
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,361
[BUGGY]
Ugh. What is it?!

195
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,489
The girl who stole our chart
is back and with a prisoner.

196
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,740
[BUGGY]
What?!

197
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:23,828
[HENCHMEN muttering]

198
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:24,745
[HENCHMAN E]
It's her!

199
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,498
That's the sneaky thief
who stole the chart!

200
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,834
[LUFFY yelps]

201
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:36,006
[NAMI] I've captured the thief,
Captain Buggy the Clown.

202
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,092
And here's your chart back!

203
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,010
Not that I don't
appreciate it.

204
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,011
But...

205
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,514
Why the sudden change
of heart, little girl?

206
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,101
I had another fight
with my boss,

207
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:49,603
and I just can't
take it anymore.

208
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:52,022
So I thought I'd see if
I could join your crew.

209
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,107
[BUGGY snorts, growls]

210
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,026
Ca‐Captain Buggy sure does
look angry, doesn't he?

211
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,237
He's gonna use the
Devil Fruit Power.

212
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,238
Really...?

213
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,741
[BUGGY snorting]

214
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:05,870
[BUGGY laughing]

215
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,121
You're fed up, huh?

216
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,123
I must admit,
you're an amusing girl.

217
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:11,625
I like you! Of course
you can join my crew!

218
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:16,630
[BUGGY laughing]

219
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,758
[NAMI] I've successfully
infiltrated them!

220
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,260
Pirates are so dumb and
easy to manipulate!

221
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,889
Hey, guys, why am I in a cage?

222
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,308
[ALL laughing]

223
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,769
It's a great day to be a pirate.

224
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,812
Girl, what do you call yourself?

225
00:09:31,896 --> 00:09:33,063
I'm Nami.

226
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,273
Ha‐ha!

227
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,942
Then let's have a welcome
party for our new friend Nami.

228
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:38,152
Let's celebrate!

229

What's wrong?

232
00:09:57,254 --> 00:10:01,175
We're throwing this party
in your honor, so eat up.

233
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:04,094
Thanks for the party,
Captain Buggy.

234
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:05,846
[NAMI]
I'll just keep my eyes peeled

235
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,015
for a chance to take
back that chart.

236
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:11,936
Maybe I'll swipe all of Buggy's
treasure, too, while I'm at it.

237
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:23,113
That's it... Almost there...

238
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,116
[yelps]

239
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,117
Dammit!

[laughing]

241
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,337
This is such a flashy party.

242
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,965
Now listen up!

243
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:43,801
Men, it's time to
prepare the Buggy Ball!

244
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,805

[HENCHMAN J snickering]

246
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,325
[HENCHMAN J]
All set, captain.

247
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,995
Wh‐What are you
doing with that thing?

248
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,998
Just observe, the awesome
might of the Buggy Ball.

249
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,165
Light it.

250
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,385
[chuckles]

251
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,852
[yelps]

252
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,778
That was one heck
of an explosion.

253
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:48,866
It looked like it was one of the
Captain's beloved Buggy Balls.

254
00:11:48,866 --> 00:11:50,242
Buggy Balls?

255
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,423
[HENCHMEN cheering]

[chuckles]

257
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:11,889
That was flashy.

258
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,308
With these Buggy Balls
and my Devil Fruit Powers,

259
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,478
I should have no problem
conquering the Grand Line.

260
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:18,938
Right, Nami?

261
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,481
Right. Yes, of course.

262
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:21,815
[LUFFY]
Huh?

263
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,816
‐‐[NAMI gasps]
‐‐[BUGGY] Huh?

264
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,945
But it's my destiny to
conquer the Grand Line.

265
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,947
[growls]

266
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,407
And then I'm gonna become
King of the Pirates.

267
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,117
Shut up, idiot!

268
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,162
[laughing]

269
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,456
[BUGGY] I can see why
you're sick of him, Nami.

270
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:38,832
Yeah, I know.

271
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,459
He never takes
anything seriously,

272
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,127
thinks that life's a big game.

273
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,338
He acts like a little kid.

274
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:46,423
‐‐[NAMI laughs]
‐‐[BUGGY] I see...

275
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,425
[BUGGY] Then how about
I give you a Buggy Ball

276
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:51,136
to blow away your old boss?

277
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:52,262
Huh?

278
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:53,847
It'll be a great opportunity

279
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:57,434
for you to prove your loyalty
to me, your new captain.

280
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,143
Men!

282
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,277
That's all right, Captain.

283
00:13:07,277 --> 00:13:09,029
We don't have to finish
him off quite yet.

284
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:13,200
Let's get back to the welcoming
party and just have more fun.

286
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:17,121

Fire! Fire! Fire!

290
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:35,139
[NAMI] If I don't shoot,
I'll be killed.

291
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,350
But if I do shoot, then I'm
no better than these pirates.

292
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,330
Now! Light the fuse, Nami!

That's what happens

302

when you take on pirates
with half‐assed resolve.

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,734

Resolve? To do what?

304

To kill someone
like it's nothing?

305
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:32,362
Is that a pirate's resolve?

No!
