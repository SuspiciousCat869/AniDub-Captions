1
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,691
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,562
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,065
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:50,036
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,239
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,340
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,179
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,616
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,586
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,055
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,396
What's that?

13
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:20,100
[KOKORO] Everyone! Breathe!

14
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,702
[KOKORO] Don't you die on me!

15
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:25,072
[FRANKY screaming]

16
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,240
[retching noises]

17
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,550
[SANJI] Is--Is Nami okay?

18
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,620
As lively as ever.
You guys are tough.

19
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,055
Welcome to the
land of the living!

20
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,658
[screaming]

21
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,826
It wasn't a nightmare!

22
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,129
Mermaids really don't exist!

23
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,798
So all those old
sailor's stories are true!

24
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,266
"Every time you
think you see a mermaid,

25
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,034
it's actually a dugong!"

26
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,101
[SANJI] Shut up, you bastards!

27
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,371
She hasn't even confessed
to being a mermaid yet!

28
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,106
Stop trying
to kill my fantasies!

29
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,341
If you wanna be specific,

30
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,508
I'm an icefish mermaid.

31
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,344
[SANJI] Stop it!

32
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,744
Don't say another word!

33
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,150
Damn it all!

34
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,623
[FRANKY 307A]
Oh, no! They're firing!

35
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,491
Big Bro!

36
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,372
[MARINE 307A] We have also
identified about 50 pirates,

37
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,107
as well as the mutinous giants,

38
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,342
attempting to escape the
island through the front gate

39
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,644
here in the northwest.

40
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,579
[USOPP] It's them!

41
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,680
Zambai and the others!

42
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,516
What did I tell you?
Sounds like they're home free!

43
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,551
No need to worry
about that bunch!

44
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,553
Even with thousands
of marines after them,

45
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,122
they still won't die!

46
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,057
[laughing]

47
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,759
I'm telling ya,
this one time those guys--

48
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,060
[MARINE 307A] We attacked
them with a full barrage

49
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,194
of cannon fire.

50
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,061
They have been eliminated.

51
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,666
All targets are
currently presumed dead.

52
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,167
[MARINE 307A] In the
island's current condition,

53
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,303
the chances of survival
are impossible.

54
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,304
Repeat.

55
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:06,673
The number of survivors
on Enies Lobby is zero.

56
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,412
He talked about it
like it was nothing.

57
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,248
How can they
kill people so easily?

58
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,283
They don't think of it that way.

59
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,485
They don't see any people.

60
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,622
To them, it's just
a tiny island on a map.

61
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,258
A place they've been sent
to erase from the world

62
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,527
without any emotion.

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,229
[ROBIN]
That's what a Buster Call is.

64
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,534
[FRANKY] Hurry up, Straw Hat!

65
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,536
Your friends are all here!

66
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:38,672
They're waiting for ya! Come on!

67
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:39,573
You hear me?

68
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:43,043
You better not die!
I won't accept it!

69
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,724
[LUFFY] This is gonna
be the last time.

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,097
[LUFFY] I won't stop until I
bring you down, you hear me?

71
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,133
Your body can't take this.
You'll kill yourself.

72
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,067
[LUFFY] Maybe.

73
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,203
I guess there's only
one way to find out.

74
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,774
[LUFFY] Now Second Gear!

75
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,378
[LUFFY] Wait for Luffy!

76
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,715
Mortal Combat on the
Bridge of Hesitation!

77
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,767
[USOPP] Come on, Luffy.

78
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,068
The suspense is killing me!

79
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:17,237
Gum-Gum Jet Pistol!

80
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,544
He jumped back so the punch
wouldn't hit him as hard!

81
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,145
[LUCCI] Moon Walk!

82
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,646
Finger Pistol!

83
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,694
[LUFFY] Jet Bullet!

84
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,268
[LUFFY] Twin Jet Pistol!

85
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,179
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum--

86
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,413
It's time to end this.

87
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,351
My next attack will push CP9's
killing arts to the limits!

88
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,220
The Six Powers Extreme!

89
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,787
[LUCCI] Secret Technique!

90
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,692
Six King Pistol!

91
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,381
[LUFFY coughing]

92
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:39,619
It's like those Impact Dials
we saw back on Skypeia.

93
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,660
But it feels like these hits
are a heck of a lot harder.

94
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,329
[LUCCI]
Tempest Kick! Victory Bird!

95
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,467
[USOPP] Luffy!

96
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,240
That Lucci guy's
strong as hell.

97
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,042
We're lucky we've got
Straw Hat to hold him back.

98
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,144
I know he coulda killed me.

99
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,448
He could probably kill all
of us if he had half a chance.

100
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,785
It's strange, but I
think Luffy always knows.

101
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,220
[CHOPPER]
Right from the start,

102
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,623
he can tell who he has to fight,

103
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,592
who he has to beat
if we're gonna survive.

104
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,727
The pigeon guy's mine.

105
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,729
I'm gonna beat
the crap out of him.

106
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,331
He has instincts
just like an animal.

107
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,732
Even more than you.

108
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,041
[MARINE 308A]
I have a report, sir.

109
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,744
Straw Hat Luffy is in
the first support column!

110
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,612
So he's still alive, then.

111
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,346
Listen up.

112
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,781
I want all ships
to take position

113
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,217
around the Bridge of Hesitation!

114
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,118
[MARINE 308A] Yes, sir!

115
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,052
[MARINES] Yes, sir!

116
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,419
--Yes, sir! Right away, sir!
--Yes, sir!

117
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,260
[USOPP]
He's not gonna die, is he?

118
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,662
[ZORO] Are you stupid?

119
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,729
[USOPP] What'd you say?

120
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,764
You're stupid, stupid!

121
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,387
What now?

122
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,088
The walls are--

123
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,494
[MARINE 308A] The first support
column has now been cut off!

124
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,469
[SANJI] What the hell?

125
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,271
They blew up half the bridge!

126
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,005
[USOPP] Yeah, but why?

127
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,776
[MARINE 308A] Rob Lucci
of CP9 and Straw Hat Luffy

128
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,212
are both inside
the support column!

129
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,382
[NAMI] The battleships
are coming this way!

130
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,317
[GONBE] Meow! Meow!

131
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,560
[MARINE 308A] All ships
take up combat positions

132
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,395
around the Bridge of Hesitation.

133
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,130
On the Bridge
and the escort ship,

134
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,798
we've identified nine pirates,

135
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,602
including the pirate
hunter Zoro and Nico Robin!

136
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,170
[MARINE 308A] We believe
that these are the culprits

137
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,540
who defeated CP9
in the Tower of Law!

138
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:19,179
They're coming here
to take Robin back.

139
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,014
[NAMI] Well let them try!

140
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,119
[MARINE 308A]
Be careful, everyone.

141
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,221
We shouldn't
underestimate the enemy.

142
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,656
Thanks to CP9,

143
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,592
no one has launched a
successful attack on Enies Lobby

144
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,627
in its 800 years of history,

145
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,330
yet this tiny pirate crew
wiped them out.

146
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,165
We thought Straw Hat
was a rookie,

147
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,268
but as we speak, he's going
head-to-head with Rob Lucci,

148
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,637
the strongest fighter
CP9 has ever seen!

149
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,340
Fighting Lucci and beating him
are two different things.

150
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,642
Right now, their crew
is completely outnumbered

151
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,544
and totally surrounded.

152
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,246
[CAPTAIN 308A] We're going
to avenge every defeat

153
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,214
we've faced today.

154
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,116
[USOPP]
Look guys, over there!

155
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:15,202
[USOPP] Hey, Luffy!

156
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,304
We made it!

157
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,540
[FRANKY] Everyone got
to the bridge safe and sound!

158
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,678
Don't you worry,
we're all doing fine!

159
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:27,748
We even rescued Robin,
just like we said we would!

160
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:31,285
All you gotta do
is beat that guy!

161
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,686
[FRANKY] We'll be waiting!

162
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,722
I know you can do it!

163
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,257
Don't give up, Luffy!

164
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,591
We're all gonna make it!

165
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,093
We're all going back!

166
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,709
Now it's just
a matter of how long

167
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,278
we can hold off all
of these damned Marines.

168
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,085
[LUCCI] It seems
it's just as you said.

169
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,353
They all survived.

170
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,489
I have to admit,
I'm rather impressed.

171
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,757
But now,

172
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,093
I'm going to bring this little
rebellion of yours to an end!

173
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,264
I will not allow any evil
to prosper in this world!

174
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,400
[ONIGUMO] Those ranked
Lieutenant Commander or below,

175
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,267
stay put!

176
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,503
To the 200 elite
Captains and Commanders,

177
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,540
engage the enemy and
wipe them out immediately!

178
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,275
Captains from Headquarters?

179
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,810
All these guys
are in the same class

180
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,346
as that Smoker guy
from before?

181
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,615
[USOPP] There's like,
a billion of 'em!

182
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,084
Only thing that proves
is that they're afraid of us.

183
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,086
I'm scared, Granny!

184
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,687
Meow!

185
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,706
Hold on, where'd Sanji go?

186
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,341
[USOPP] He was here
just a second ago!

187
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:01,609
Damn it.

188
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,511
The one time I want that stupid
cook around and he runs away.

189
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,047
All hands prepare to move in!

190
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,616
Let's go!

191
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:18,292
[MARINES]
Yeah!

192
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,127
Stop trying to show
off. Just attack already!

193
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,497
Now this should be fun.

194
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,101
I could always use some
more heads to bust, heh!

195
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,770
[ZORO] No matter what happens,
we can't give them an inch!

196
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,040
Until Luffy makes it here,
we have to hold our ground!

197
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,541
We need to get
down to the bridge.

198
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,744
If they damage this ship,
we can't escape!

199
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:39,479
I won't let them
capture me ever again!

200
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,051
Darn it.

201
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,253
I can't move!

202
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,521
Destroy them!

203
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,808
[ONIGUMO] Those ranked
Lieutenant Commander or below,

204
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,675
stay put!

205
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,145
To the 200 elite
Captains and Commanders,

206
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,281
engage the enemy and
wipe them out immediately!

207
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,716
Destroy them!

208
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,118
[MARINES shouting]

209
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,254
[CAPTAIN 308A] Capture Nico
Robin and bring her here!

210
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,124
We're not giving her back

211
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:26,093
after all the trouble
we've gone through!

212
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,329
You can send me as many
Captains as you want!

213
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,530
Let's do this!

214
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:32,199
You can send him my
share of captains, too.

215
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,435
Weapons Left.

216
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,569
Let's go!

217
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,437
[MARINES shouting]

218
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,241
Beating one at a time
is too much trouble.

219
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,442
I'll take you all on at once!

220
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,314
[USOPP] Bear witness to the
power of the Sniper King!

221
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,516
Sunflower Star!

222
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,020
[MARINES shouting]

223
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,426
[FRANKY]
You wanna fight with guns?

224
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,094
I can do that.

225
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,131
[CAPTAIN 308B] Damn pirate!

226
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,068
[FRANKY] You ready?

227
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,103
Weapons Left.

228
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,470
Eat this!

229
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,143
Want some more?

230
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,245
How 'bout a Strong Right?

231
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:35,729
Whoa, hey buddy!

232
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,331
Time out, time out!

233
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,466
This is not how this works!
If you wanna use a sword,

234
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,502
then you go fight
with Zoro, not me!

235
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:43,437
You wanna play fair, right?

236
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,473
[USOPP]
Wait! Look! Over there!

237
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,241
[USOPP] Gunpowder Star!

238
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,177
All right!

239
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,379
Hope they're all
as dumb as that guy!

240
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,382
[USOPP]
Whoa! I almost fell off!

241
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,318
They need to put
a guardrail here!

242
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,552
That was close!

243
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,187
These guys are
like cockroaches.

244
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,523
You stomp on one of them,
five more show up.

245
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,491
It's a real pain in the ass.

246
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,460
[ZORO] I don't care how
many men you throw at me--

247
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,195
You're still not gonna win.

248
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,162
Come on!

249
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,364
Isn't there anyone here
with some backbone?

250
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:17,070
[ZORO]
A broad-axe? Interesting.

251
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,410
[ZORO] That's much better.

252
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,251
Is that all you got?

253
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,420
You'll have to do more
than swing that thing around

254
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,622
like a big stick
if you wanna beat me.

255
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:48,168
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style...

256
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,370
...Oni Giri!

257
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,542
Not again!

258
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,311
You guys gotta follow
the rules, damn it!

259
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,779
Sword guys fight Zoro!

260
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,181
Leave me alone!

261
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,215
Huh?

262
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:05,785
Oh. Good one, buddy!

263
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,688
[ZORO] Duck!

264
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,058
Nice one!

265
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,259
Keep up the good work!

266
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:16,697
[MARINES shouting]

267
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,798
Uh-oh!

268
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,800
The bad guys're coming, Granny!

269
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,068
Meow!

270
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,570
Well, that ain't good.

271
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,572
You stay here and
guard the boat, Robin.

272
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,740
I'll do my best
to hold them back!

273
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,313
Here I come!

274
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,081
Now Thunder Charge!

275
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,353
[NAMI] Swing Arm!

276
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,165
[NAMI] Thunder Ball!

277
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:51,865
[MARINE 308C] What the hell?

278
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,366
[MARINE 308B] They're clouds!

279
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,341
That one's my
Thunderbolt Tempo!

280
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,741
I did it!

281
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,412
[MARINE 308C] She's mocking us
with that ridiculous weapon!

282
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,581
[MARINE 308D]
Learn some respect, pirate!

283
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,593
[NAMI] Robin!

284
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,663
You don't have to worry
about protecting me anymore.

285
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:25,332
If the crew is fighting,
then I'm fighting, too.

286
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:30,504
There's more?

287
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,274
[KOKORO]
Nothin' to see here, boys!

288
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:35,242
We're just hostages!

289
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,543
[CHIMNEY] Don't mind us!

290
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,245
[GONBE]
Meow!

291
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,797
Luffy'll be here soon!
We can't give up!

292
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:10,277
[LUFFY yelling]

293
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,515
What's the matter?

294
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,085
Don't tell me that
blood-pumping technique of yours

295
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:20,086
is losing its edge already!

296
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,459
[LUCCI]
It's pointless to struggle.

297
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,561
You never stood a chance
against the World Government

298
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,229
in the first place!

299
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,031
Face the facts!

300
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:34,735
[LUFFY] Gum-Gum Jet Axe!

301
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:37,771
[LUCCI] I don't care if this
island is burned to the ground.

302
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,244
[LUCCI] So long as that woman is
wanted by the World Government,

303
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:46,480
I'll chase her to the ends
of the Earth if need be!

304
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,749
[LUCCI] That is the
meaning of Dark Justice!

305
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,484
You won't be chasing anyone!

306
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:54,154
I'm putting an end to this,
right here, right now!

307
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,723
[LUFFY] Jet Stamp!

308
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:02,796
[LUCCI] Six King Gun!

309
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,479
[LUFFY choked yelling]

310
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,744
[USOPP] Oh, no!

311
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:28,682
[CAPTAIN 308F] I got him!

312
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:29,716
[ZORO] Watch out!

313
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,386
Damn it, this is no time
for you to be spacing out, Us--

314
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:04,251
[USOPP] Luffy!

315
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,298
[LUFFY] Everyone survived.

316
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,199
We're all going back together!

317
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:23,804
All I have to do is beat
this bastard once and for all.

318
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,506
Just wait, Robin!

319
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,575
I promise I'll make it!

320
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,343
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

321
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,078
Fists Full of Emotion!

322
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,781
Luffy Unleashes Gatling
with All His Might.

323
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:36,550
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
