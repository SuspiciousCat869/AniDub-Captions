1
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,994
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,198
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,034
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,837
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,505
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,408
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,244
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,146
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,480
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,017
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,187
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,424
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,694
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:18,732
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,705
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,773
Luffy is headed to
the Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:29,510
rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,381
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, with
Ace's looming execution

20
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,783
only a few hours away,

21
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:41,255
the Whitebeard Pirates
suddenly appear at Navy HQ.

22
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,258
[WHITEBEARD]
We've got plenty to talk about.

23
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,426
Like you not killing my son.

24
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,428
[ACE]
Father!

25
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,429
[NARRATOR]
In an instant,

26
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,599
the silence is broken
and all-out war erupts.

27
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,269
[MORIA]
What the...? That's not right.

28
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,104
And here comes the final payoff.

29
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,274
That harmless seaquake he
threatened us with earlier

30
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,443
was just the prelude
to a massive tsunami!

31
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,514
[MARINE CC]
It's a tsunami!

32
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,520
[AOKIJI]
Ice Age!

33
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,429
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

34
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,666
You gonna grace them with
your sword for once?

35
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,968
[MIHAWK]
I'm just gauging the distance.

36
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,970
How far do you think he is?

37
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,273
Strange, but somehow
it feels like...

38
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,976
he's standing right
in front of us.

39
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,187
[LUFFY]
"An All-Consuming Inferno!

40
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,090
Admiral Akainu's Power!"

41
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,470
Ah!

42
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,171
Run away!

43
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,772
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES scream]

44
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,718
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE C]
Pops, no!

45
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,988
[JOZU yells]

46
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,538
[JOZU yells]

47
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,619
[WHITEBEARD]
Hmm.

48
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,889
That's insane!

49
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,559
He blocked the world's
greatest swordsman.

50
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,541
[JOZU grunts]

51
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,076
No! It...

52
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,544
It's him.

53
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:25,586
[MARINE A] Third division
commander, Diamond Jozu!

54
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,379
[MARINE B gasps, groans]

55

[MARINES groan]

56
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,585
Wouldn't let my guard
down, if I were you!

57
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,488
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE D]
C'mon, guys!

58
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,290
Keep advancin' on
the front line!

59
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,826
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yell]

60
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,060
Push them back!

[MARINES yell]

62
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,976
Damn fools.

63
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,445
They're trying to break
through from the front.

64
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,149
[SENGOKU]
Attenion artillery unit!

65
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:33,787
Open fire on all enemy ships as
well as the approaching pirates!

66

[MARINES]
Sir!

67
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,830
[MARINE AA]
Forward units!

68
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,333
Block off all access
to this plaza!

69
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,968
[MARINES]
Sir!

72
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,619
My, my.

73
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,523
[KIZARU]
Whitebeard's commanders

74
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,359
are a frightening bunch of
monsters, aren't they?

75
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,629
Though I do admit,
they put on a good show.

76
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,704
[KIZARU] Still, if we want
to stop this party

77
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,706
before they wreck the place,

78
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:30,010
we simply need to remove the
head of this unruly, behemoth.

79
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,224
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES grunt]

80
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,592
It's so bright!

81
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,194
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE F]
What the hell?!

82
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,341
Ah! It's Kizaru!

83
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,711
Yasakani Sacred Jewel!

84
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,116
It's too bright.

85
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,885
Could ya tone it
down a little, pal?

86
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,026
[KIZARU]
Hm?

87
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,847
[WHITEBEARD chuckles]

88
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:42,783
He stopped the Admiral's
attack, but how?

89
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,452
I dunno!

90
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,088
It's almost like he's got wings!

91
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:52,426
Huh? Well, fancy that!

92
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,495
[MARCO]
The king's off limits.

93
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,764
If you wanna reach him...

94
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,536
...you gotta go
through me first.

95
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,273
Scary.

96
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,275
These Whitebeards play rough.

97
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,176
What the...?

98
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,944
He's on fire!

99
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,448
[MARINE J]
He took Kizaru's attack head on

100
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,817
and he's just... floating there!

101
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,519
[MARINE K] I dunno what
kind of Devil Fruit that is,

102
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,320
but I don't like it!

103
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,924
Even more rare
than Logia powers.

104
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,995
Zoan type. Mythical creature.

105
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,131
[MARINE BB]
Look! His wounds are healing!

106
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,766
[MARINE CC]
This can't be real.

107
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,002
That didn't hurt him at all?

108
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,939
Oh, it did.

109
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,181
Don't lie to protect my pride.

110

[MARCO yells]

111
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,325
So that must be the 1st
division commander. Whoa.

"If his flames can't
turn away an attack,

113
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,663
then they can heal
him when it's done!"

114
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,299
Marco the Phoenix!

115
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,171
Look at that lovely bird.
It must be quite rare!

116
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,314
[KIZARU]
Uh?

[MARCO grunts]

118
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:28,889
Well, that's quite
the painful kick!

119
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,892
Now you're lying! Ha!

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,469
[MARINES gasping]

121
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,245
Just standing here
is dangerous enough!

He okay? Kizaru!

123
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,753
[MARINES gasp]

124
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,356
[KIZARU]
Hm... My fault.

125
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,092
I really should've known better.

126
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,394
If your boss was
that easy to kill,

127
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,564
you wouldn't be here
right now, would you?

128
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,702
Heh.

What were they thinking,

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,419
abandoning their
posts like that?

[AKAINU] What if I had
done the same, huh?

[HARUTO grunts]

179
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,310
[BLAMENCO chuckles]

180
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,813
[MARINES groan]

181
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:35,849
Take out the commanders
at all costs!

182
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,786
[MARINE EE] Don't let them get
ashore! Sink the Moby Dick!

183
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,689
Push forward and
aim for Whitebeard!

184
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,533
[COBY whimpers]

185
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,372
[COBY]
These are pirates, my enemy.

186
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:02,176
This isn't a training
exercise, this is war!

187
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,013
I can't!

188
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,684
[COBY] My knees are
frozen! I can't move!

189
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,522
[HELMEPPO]
It's pointless.

190
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,226
These guys would slaughter us
without a second glance!

191
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,527
[COBY whimpers]

192
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,065
I mean, you realize
that, right?

193
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,900
[COBY whimpers]

194
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,268
[HELMEPPO]
Just look around you.

195
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,170
They're monsters, butchers!

196
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,939
There's not a single
thing amateurs like us

197
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,707
can do against
guys like that!

198
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:37,010
We've gotta run if
we wanna live, okay?

199
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,545
Okay?

200
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:39,780
[COBY]
But...

201
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,282
Look, don't be an idiot!
There is no but!

202
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,517
Do you understand me?

203
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,352
The only thing we can
contribute to this battle

204
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:48,589
is more blood for those
killers to spill over the ice!

205
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:49,590
[COBY exhales]

206
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,557
Just listen!

207
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,593
You wanna become an
admiral, don't you?!

208
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:53,560
[COBY gasps]

209
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:59,633
Because I promised myself
that I'll keep trying.

210
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:04,571
Till, till I become
a Marine Admiral!

211
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,573
You said you're gonna
fight me, right?

212
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:09,610
Then you will become that
strong. You'll have to.

213
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,611
[COBY]
Uh...!

214
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:16,950
Hey, look!

215
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,052
Don't take this the wrong
way! I'm just sayin'.

216
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,387
That's why we should run!

217
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,955
We both have a future!

218
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,559
It's not right for either
of us to die here!

219
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,628
There's too much
left for us to do!

220
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,630
We're the chosen ones!

221
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,434
But, Luffy! I made a
promise to him, didn't I?

222
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,303
[BOTH gasp]

223
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:39,106
[HELMEPPO]
What now? Where is it?

224
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,374
[gasps]

225
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,726
Here he comes!

226
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:09,803
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES groaning]

227
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:20,614
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yell]

228
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,834
[MARINE W]
Attack! Kill it!

229
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:48,075
All right, bring down
their artillery defense!

230
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,878
[OARS JR. growls]

231
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,946
[MARINE X whimpers]

232
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,485
[ALL gasp]

233
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:05,893
[OARS JR.]
Brother Ace!

234
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:07,261
[ACE gasps]

235
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,495
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES cheer]

236
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:13,033
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE M] Nicely
done! Get 'em, little Oars Jr!

237
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:15,702
[OARS JR. roars]

238
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:24,578
He must be related to
the Continent Puller.

239
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,246
He's enormous!

240
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:29,383
At least twice as big as
one of the regular giants.

241
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:31,852
We can't let him invade
the island, no matter what!

242
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,921
He'll give them too much
leverage in the fight!

243
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:38,425
[MORIA cackles] Just look
at that beautiful beast!

244
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:42,429
And I didn't even know that
Oars had a living descendant!

245
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:47,267
I want it! I call his
corpse after the battle!

246
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,772
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

247
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:54,241
Now that's more like it!

248
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:57,444
[ACE whimpers]

249
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,613
Little Oars!

250
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:03,617
Ace is a nice guy!
He's my friend!

251
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:06,653
I'm not gunna let you hurt him.

252
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,623
He won't die!

253
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,129
[NARRATOR]
Although the Straw Hat Crew's

254
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,398
battle with Oars is
long in the past,

255
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,801
Little Oars Jr. is
still wreaking havoc

256
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,636
as a member of
White Beard's crew.

257
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,972
Bursting through the bay,
he goes head-to-head with

258
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:29,142
the Navy's team of giants in
an Earth-shaking confrontation.

259
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,911
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

260
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,746
"A Descendant of the Beast!

261
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,449
Little Oars Jr.
Full Speed Ahead!"

262
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:38,085
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
