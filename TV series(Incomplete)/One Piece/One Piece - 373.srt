And to think we were all
about to throw in the towel!

We got his back nice

What in the hell
are these guys doing?

230
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:08,172
His structure's the
same as a human's,

231
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,007
which means his
spine is S-shaped,

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,177
designed to carry weight as well
as soften impact to the body.

233
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,980
But when the spine is
pulled into a straight line

234
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:17,681
it won't be able
to absorb impact,

235
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:20,651
and he'll have to bear the
full force of Luffy's attack!

His inability to feel
any pain turned out

244
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,442
to be a weakness.

00:14:45,476 --> 00:14:48,445

the weakness of your crew!

I trusted my
underlings as you do,

337
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:29,903
but despite their talents,

338
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,706
do you know why
I ended up losing them?

339
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,553
Because they were mortal!

different this time!

even if they fall!

00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,222
[ZOMBIE 373A]
It's got me!

351
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:34,668
[MORIA] Now, every last
shadow in Thriller Bark.

352
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:38,205
Come to me, and become my power!

353
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:42,309
Shadows Asgard!

354
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:45,112
What's happening?

355
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:49,783
His shadow came out!

356
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:57,891
All these shadows.
No way!

357
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:00,661
He's gathering up every
shadow on this island

358
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,229
and pumping them into his body!

359
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:13,040
Tell me, Straw Hat Luffy.

360
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,174
From your strength,

361
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,277
I'd say you absorbed about
a hundred shadows, right?

362
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,747
Then I shall take--100!

363
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,185
[MORIA]
200!

364
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,222
[MORIA]
300!

365
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,160
[MORIA]
400!

366
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:38,065
[MORIA]
500!

367
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,004
[MORIA]
600!

368
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,010
[MORIA]
700!

369
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,950
[MORIA]
800!

370
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,090
[MORIA]
900!

371
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:11,264
Kushishishi! Kushishishi!

372
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:14,101
1,000!

373
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,408
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
We are so screwed!

374
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,143
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
There's no way we can win now.

375
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:25,746
He's a thousand times bigger
and stronger than before.

376
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,381
[LUFFY] I don't care how
big or strong he gets.

377
00:23:28,415 --> 00:23:31,752
I won't quit till he spits out
every one of those shadows.

378
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,387
I'm going to the
New World no matter what!

379
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,089
On the next One Piece:

380
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,190
"Our Bodies Vanish!

381
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:40,327
The Morning Sun Shines
on the Nightmarish Island!"

382
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,896
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
