00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.213
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.482
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.418
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.653
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.526
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.289
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece,

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.225
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.263
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:46.366
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.034
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.471
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.575
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.779
[NARRATOR]
Two years have passed

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.115
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.317
Reuniting after their
special training,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.320
Luffy and his crew continue
on to the New World.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.223
The first stop is Fishman
Island, thousands of feet

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:13.726
below sea level, where
trouble finds them quickly.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.328
[SHARLEY]
The pirate boy in a straw hat!

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.330
It's an emergency!

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.066
He must leave the country!

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.235
Now, before we run out of time!

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.039
[gasps]

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.044
[SHARLEY] I saw him clearly
surrounded by flames.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.613
Because of Straw Hat Luffy,

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.884
Fishman Island,
our country will be...

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:39.519
...destroyed!

[LUFFY
"The King of the Fishman Island!

--[footsteps]

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.642
[GYRO]
Hurry up! We hafta move!

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.277
Come on, but quietly!

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.512
We can't let them know!

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.215
We're all dead if they notice.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.518
It's our only chance. Get on
the ship and grab an oar!

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.488
We either get out of here
today, or we die trying!

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:32.538
[PIRATE 530AA]
C'mon faster!

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.407
They'll be on top
of us in minutes!

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.643
[GYRO] We'll never go
back to Fishman Island.

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.478
Don't let up till
we cross the Red Line!

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.581
Damn it! I never got
to visit the Mermaid Café!

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.983
[PIRATE 530B]
I never got to either!

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.252
It's such a waste!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.254
[GYRO] Will you idiots
get over it already?

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.657
Just shut up and keep rowing!

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.925
This whole thing is a disaster.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.129
I thought we had it made after
we got past the sleeping kraken,

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.197
then they ambushed us.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.868
At 10,000 meters below
and with so many sea monsters

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:05.872
at their disposal, there was
no way to defend ourselves!

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:13.413
They told us we could join
the New Fishman Pirates,

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:14.614
or we could die.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.150
As if they were really
giving us a choice at all.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.552
Who wouldn't pick
life over death?

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.853
It's absurd!

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.423
I mean, each and every
one of us is human.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.025
Why would they want us
in their ranks anyway?

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:29.595
[PIRATE 530B]
Goodbye, Mermaid Café!

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.563
Goodbye!

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.098
[PIRATES sobbing]

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.900
[GYRO]
I told you all to get over it!

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.369
We're lucky to even
be alive right now!

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:40.673
Really? They escaped?

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.442
I'm afraid so, boss.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.977
My back was turned,
and they got away.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:50.183
[DOSUN]
Humans are always runnin for it.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.552
You'd think they woulda
learned by now.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:55.988
[ZEO] Heh. Cowardice
is in their nature.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.725
[DARUMA] You shoulda let me
chew on them when I offered!

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.360
Caw, caw, caw!

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:04.364
[chuckles] Ugh, what
a pain in the ass.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:10.336
[laughs] No, it's good.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.307
See, now we can
use 'em as examples.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.876
[chuckles] Then I'll go
and drag 'em back

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.678
so you can teach
'em their lesson.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.880
[HORDY] Not this time,
you won't. Stay here.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:23.249
Uh, if you say so, boss.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.417
I'll go myself.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.718
[DARUMA]
Huh?

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.955
[HORDY] You heard me.
Get the bubble ready.

Boss! You can't take that
much power drug at once!

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:43.903
It's dangerous!

Oh, my gosh! Monsieur Pappagu!

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.514
[FANGIRL FISHWOMAN 530A] As in
the super famous designer?

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:03.950
[FANGIRL MERMAID 530B]
I thought he'd be taller.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.320

must be a pain.

I'm what you'd call...

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.034
...a fashionable starfish.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.736
But on Fishman Island,

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.705
I'm so much more than that.

00:08:25.738 --> 00:08:27.807
Seeing as I'm the president
and lead designer

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.809
for Criminal Brand clothes!

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:33.212

coveted throughout the world!

No country is off limits
for our store chains!

Whoa! What's that?

Hey! Are you listening? Come on!

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.525

a Criminal Brand store.

--[LUFFY] Cool!
--I wasn't done talking.

[SALESMAN 530A] Miss, I'm sorry.
but I can't accommodate you.

Giving you a discount like
that could cost me my job!

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:02.942
Sounds like someone
is causing them trouble.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.343

I don't care how cute
these clothes are,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.648
they're way too expensive!

the price to 10,000 berries!

half the retail price!

I cannot do that!

thought. Cheapskate.

charge of this extortion ring?

called "brand equity."

are popular, they're--

This is unheard of.

figured this out by now?

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:09.194
[PIRATES screaming]

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:13.565
[HORDY] Set them adrift
in the New World.

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.938
Okay? But some of those
guys are still alive.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.506
Shouldn't we kill
them all first?

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.077
[HORDY laughs]
No, they have a purpose.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.012
You'll see.

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.681
Those of you who are
getting away with just cuts

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:33.218
and bruises will live
to send a message.

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:36.788
Tell the people up above what
happened to you in the sea.

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:39.791
Let them know who
did this to you.

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.361
You've seen my
strength firsthand,

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.896
so don't spare a single detail.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.400
Because once we've liberated
Fishman Island from the gutless

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.302
"God of the Sea" Neptune,

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:53.538
we'll be coming to drag you
humans to the bottom of these

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:56.074
depths, I promise you that!

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:59.344
And the Fishmen will stand
on top of the world,

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.613
as the supreme species!

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:08.987
[laughs]

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:16.128
[NARRATOR] Luffy and friends
accept King Neptune's invitation

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:17.963
and head for Ryugu Palace.

00:23:17.996 --> 00:23:20.632
However, Luffy is tempted
by the smell of food

00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:23.101
and leaves the group
in search of something to eat.

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.537
Wandering the palace,
he soon comes upon an enormous

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.973
tower with a sturdy sealed door.

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:30.575
What is the story behind
the strange weapons

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:32.244
lodged in its side?

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:33.812
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:37.582
"The Ryugu Palace! Taken by
the Shark That They Saved!"

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.985
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
