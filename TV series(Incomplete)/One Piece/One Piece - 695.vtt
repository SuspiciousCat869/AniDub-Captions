00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.966
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.502
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.492
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.430
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.463 --> 00:03:20.501
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.739
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:25.645
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:28.651
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.684 --> 00:03:31.455
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.935
The stars will be worth
100 million berries each.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.907
[TOYS]
100 million berries?!

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.411
[NARRATOR] Amidst the chaos,
he also put prices on the heads

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:46.085
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:46.118 --> 00:03:47.421
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.793
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:49.827 --> 00:03:52.030
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.769
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:56.907
[VIOLET]
Oh no.

00:03:56.941 --> 00:03:58.844
Sugar has woken up!

00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:00.615
[USOPP]
This is a mess!

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:04.422
Last time, Robin, she got
turned into a toy by Sugar,

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:07.829
and it was seriously messed up.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:12.070
I didn't even realize I forgot
her until she was turned back.

00:04:12.103 --> 00:04:14.442
If Sugar touches Luffy,
it's over.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:16.981
For us, he'll be gone.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:18.416
It's worse, even.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.955
Like your friend
never even existed.

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.093
She can't do that.

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:25.430
It's not ideal, but here goes.

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:28.036
I'll make a long-distance shot.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:32.211
You realize this
could get terribly ugly.

00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:36.252
Even in death,
our bond will never break.

00:04:36.285 --> 00:04:37.789
Mark my words.

00:04:37.822 --> 00:04:39.191
No matter where I am.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.628
No matter what I'm doing.

00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:42.899
Even if I must
abandon my duties.

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:47.174
The moment that Luffy needs
my help, I'll be there.

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:50.848
[SABO yells]

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:52.084

Farul! Stay with me!

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.302
This is awful!
It crushed his head!

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.975
Please, my friend, don't die!

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.013

coming back, no matter what!

[BARTOLOMEO groans]

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.203
I'm falling! Oh no!

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:22.311
My Yellow Cubs are down! [gasps]

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:23.313

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.021
Take the key to Law!

00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:28.858

[GLADIUS]
She got away.

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:46.191
[GLADIUS] Well, she's just
one little brat.

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:47.729
Even if she makes it
to the palace,

00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:50.401
she won't be able
to do anything.

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.437
Luffy. Traffy. Soldier.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.141
Go on ahead to the Flower Field.

00:05:54.175 --> 00:05:56.813
Get that key.
We can handle this.

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:57.682
Yep!

[LUFFY]
Soldier!

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:31.943
I'm going ahead! [grunts]

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:33.813
Hey, wait a sec!

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:36.051
[grunts]

00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:37.287
You okay?

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.990
[CAVENDISH] Spare your
concern, Straw Hat!

00:19:39.024 --> 00:19:41.261
I won't die
in a place like this!

00:19:41.295 --> 00:19:44.568
I still have a score to settle
with these monsters!

00:19:46.505 --> 00:19:48.409
[CAVENDISH]
Until my dear Farul is avenged,

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:51.582
I refuse to take
another step forward!

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.922
[CAVENDISH]
Now, go!

00:19:56.725 --> 00:20:03.305
[LUFFY grunting]

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:07.615
Luffy, watch out! Bombs!

00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:10.887
[BARTOLOMEO]
Leave this to me!

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:14.628
Use a barrier, you fool!

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:19.270
[BARTOLOMEO yells]

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:21.509
Damn it, Bartolomeo!

00:20:21.542 --> 00:20:24.214
[coughs]

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.384
What's the matter with you?

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:30.426
[BARTOLOMEO] I can only make
so much barrier at once.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.363
And I'm at my limit.

00:20:32.396 --> 00:20:35.770
I used every last inch
making those stairs.

00:20:35.804 --> 00:20:40.513
[BARTOLOMEO coughs, pants]

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:43.085
[BARTOLOMEO]
But that's fine by me.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.990
If it helps Mister Luffy,
even a little.

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:50.533
Then I'm happy to die,
right here and now!

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:54.741
[BARTOLOMEO]
Happy!

00:20:56.512 --> 00:20:58.783
You're quite the piece
of work, aren't you?

00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:00.452
Tough it out a bit
and I'll guard you

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:03.391
until you can use
your barriers again.

00:21:07.568 --> 00:21:10.372
[sighs] You don't have
any manners, huh?

00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:13.311
[ROBIN]
Cinco Mano! Time to Spank!

00:21:16.017 --> 00:21:19.291
[CAVENDISH gasps]

00:21:19.324 --> 00:21:21.027
[CAVENDISH]
Nico Robin!

00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:25.737
[ROBIN] I know how you feel.
I'm with you, Rooster.

00:21:35.723 --> 00:21:38.361
[ROBIN] Our captain
is something special.

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:51.387
[ROBIN] I'd risk anything
for him. Even my life.

00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:20.547
Luffy's our trump card.
He's our key to victory.

00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:28.428
Mil Fleurs! Gigantesco Mano!

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.563
[GLADIUS]
Huh?

00:22:47.634 --> 00:22:49.872
You're not laying
a finger on my captain.

00:22:49.905 --> 00:22:51.474
Now suck on that!

00:22:51.508 --> 00:22:57.353
[LUFFY yelling]

00:22:57.386 --> 00:22:59.891
[LUFFY]
I hope you're ready!

00:23:01.529 --> 00:23:04.735
[LUFFY] 'Cause I'm
coming for you, Mingo!

00:23:14.689 --> 00:23:16.157
[NARRATOR]
The Top Executive, Diamante,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.233
hounds Rebecca relentlessly
as she flees for her life.

00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:21.569
With Luffy still on his way,

00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:24.173
she's forced to make
a desperate, final stand.

00:23:24.207 --> 00:23:27.515
That is until the undefeated
gladiator Kyros appears

00:23:27.548 --> 00:23:30.085
to settle a very old score.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:31.723
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:35.362
"A Tearful Reunion!
Rebecca and Kyros!"

00:23:35.395 --> 00:23:38.101
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
