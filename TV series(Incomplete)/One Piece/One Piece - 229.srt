1
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,256
There's a... There's a
frog doing the front crawl!

2
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,257
[LUFFY]
What?

3
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,626
See for yourself!
It's headed to your side!

4
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,460
Really?

5
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,294
Come on, Luffy.

6
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,195
Are you really
gonna take anything

7
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,798
that goofy Admiral
told you seriously?

8
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,233
There's no way a frog
would do the front crawl.

9
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,067
It's... HOLY CRAP!

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,403
THERE'S A FROG DOING
THE FRONT CRAWL!

11
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,038
Come on! After him!

12
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,339
[ZORO, USOPP, and CHOPPER]
Aye-aye!

13
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,778
Now what's a lighthouse
doing way out here?

14
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,680
I wonder if anyone lives there.

15
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:31,151
[ZORO, USOPP, LUFFY and CHOPPER]
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

16
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,253
[LUFFY]
It's flying!!

17
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,554
Quick! Don't let it get away!

18
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,256
Let's get up ahead of it
and block its course!

19
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,329
I guess we ran
ashore or something!

20
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,297
Huh?

21
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,732
What is that sound?

22
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:50,337
[bell clanging]

23
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,741
[distant whistle blow]

24
00:02:53,774 --> 00:03:02,283
[bell clanging and
chugging noises]

25
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,717
[NAMI]
Full reverse! Right now!

26
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,152
Turn 180 degrees!

27
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,764
[whistle blow]

28
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:17,765
What the hell is that?!

29
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,700
Turn the ship around! Now!

30
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,067
[NAMI]
Hurry!

31
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,612
Aaaah!

32
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,613
Ahh!

33
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,247
AAAAAAHH!

34
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,061
[LUFFY]
Whoa! That was close!

35
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,433
[USOPP] That hunk of
metal's trying to kill us!

36
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,567
[CHOPPER]
Is it a ship?

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,469
No way! Something
that big and heavy

38
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,437
shouldn't even
be able to float!

39
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,476
Hey, what're you doing?!
Get out of the way!

40
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,116
[growls]

41
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,354
Oh no! Froggy!

42
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,314
It looked like it was
spitting out smoke!

43
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,093
[CHIMNEY]
Pirates?

44
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,496
Granny! Granny!
Look! We got pirates!

45
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,665
[KOKORO] What?
Izzat true, Chimney?!

46
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,533
Okey dokey then, in that case.

47
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,436
Better bring Granny
the Transponder Snail!

48
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,140
It's gonna be big pain
if they call for help

49
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,541
and the marines show up.

50
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:08,742
What should we do?

51
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,779
[CHIMNEY]
Here it is, Granny!

52
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,747
[KOKORO]
Uhm... hello?

53
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,183
Who is this?

54
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,652
Sorry, you got the wrong number.

55
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,253
She's totally drunk!

56
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,794
[KOKORO]
Oh! Paille, huh?

57
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,564
That stuff goes
good with booze!

58
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,666
[CHIMNEY]
Mm-mm! Yummy!

59
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,101
My name's Chimney.

60
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,703
This is our kitty cat, Gonbe

61
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,705
and that's Granny Kokoro.

62
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,173
You fellas wouldn't happen

63
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,142
to be train robbers, would ya?
Wahahaha!

64
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,045
My name's Luffy and I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates.

65
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:45,579
Really?

66
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,446
Yep.

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,250
Hahahaha!
I like you, you're funny!

68
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,286
By the way, Chimney. That
thing's a steam boat, right?

69
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,821
Seems awfully long to me.

70
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,756
Can't imagine it
getting very far.

71
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,757
[CHIMNEY chuckles]

72
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,592
You've probably never
seen anything like this.

73
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,228
Seeing as it's the
only one in the world.

74
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,095
It's not a steam boat,

75
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,099
it's a sea train
called the Puffing Tom.

76
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:05,799
[NAMI]
How does it work?

77
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,268
It uses a steam engine to turn

78
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,769
its paddlewheels
and run on a railway.

79
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,673
Railway?

80
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,674
[CHIMNEY]
Uh-huh! If you look close,

81
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,311
you can see the tracks
right below the waves.

82
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,280
The train goes the
same route every day,

83
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,548
taking people from
one island to the next.

84
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,418
It carries ships and
packages and other stuff, too.

85
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,820
Oh wow, funny we
didn't notice it before.

86
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,589
No kidding,
we ran right into it.

87
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,224
You should be more careful!

88
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,558
Didn't you see the signal?

89
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,594
There's a bell
ringing and everything!

90
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,362
Is that what that thing is for?

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,830
I thought it was just
here to welcome us.

92
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,332
How were we supposed to know?!

93
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,633
And if we couldn't figure it out

94
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,202
then that frog sure
wouldn't get it, would he?

95
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,204
It was awful rude of
you to hit him like that.

96
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,073
We were gonna catch him
and cook him, you know.

97
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,109
Oh, you saw the frog?
That's Yokozuna.

98
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,811
[LUFFY]
He sure was an awesome swimmer.

99
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,613
[CHIMNEY] Either way,
I wouldn't worry about him,

100
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,048
he's pretty tough.

101
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,349
In fact, that
wasn't the first time

102
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,284
he's challenged
the train and lost.

103
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,652
He's really kind of a pain.

104
00:06:58,685 --> 00:06:59,719
If you want to see him again,

105
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,689
just hang around here
and I'm sure he'll pop up.

106
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,223
That's why he didn't run.

107
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,792
Wow, I thought
that frog was stupid,

108
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,461
but it turns out he was
just being super manly.

109
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,462
[CHIMNEY]
Easy for you to say!

110
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,631
You don't have to put up
with him all the time!

111
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:11,765
I can't even count
how many times

112
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,601
he's broken the rail guard.

113
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,602
And just imagine what it's like

114
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,705
for the passengers when
he slams into the train!

115
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,306
That's pretty crazy.

116
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,542
Okay, since that
frog's a fighter like me,

117
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,277
I'm not gonna eat him after all!

118
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,579
Who would want to eat that
gross thing in the first place?

119
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,583
Anyways, after this, where're
you folks headed off to?

120
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,686
The sea train runs
to all sorts of places.

121
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:37,625
There's the town of the
Spring Queen, St. Poplar.

122
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,496
There's the gourmet town, Pucci
or the Carnival town, San Faldo.

123
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,498
They're all fun places to go.

124
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,233
And if you happen to
work for the government,

125
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,401
you can take a special train

126
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,170
that's even fancier
than the Puffing Tom.

127
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,073
The gourmet town, Pucci?

128
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,808
Oh! That's the place
those people we met

129
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,244
on the island
were talking about.

130
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,045
[LUFFY]
Hey! You're right!

131
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,752
Good, then that's the
place we're gonna g--

132
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:05,886
Give it up!

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,188
Thanks, but there's no reason
for us to take the train

134
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,556
when we have our own ship.

135
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,158
We'll just follow the log.

136
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,193
Oh? Where's it pointing to?

137
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,795
Should be someplace
east of here.

138
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,666
I see. Well, in that case
it's Water Seven for sure.

139
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,234
The train you saw
on the way here

140
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:23,270
just came from
Blue Station on that island.

141
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,272
They call it
the City of Water.

142
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,674
I think you'll like it!

143
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,142
Water Seven, huh?

144
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,577
They got great shipyards.

145
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,645
You might say that's
their claim to fame.

146
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,281
When it comes to boats,
they're first class!

147
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,549
They're always
coming up with some

148
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,519
fancy new technology to build
boats for the World Government.

149
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,356
Whoa, then they must have
some awesome shipwrights, too!

150
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,159
[KOKORO] Some? More like
damn near all of 'em!

151
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,661
City's like a regular
shipwright's convention!

152
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,163
Ah! You hear that?!

153
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,531
Yeah!

154
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,099
All right then. It's settled!

155
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:54,068
We're gonna find the best
shipwright in Water Seven

156
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,469
and get him to join our crew!

157
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,607
Oh, is that so?
In that case, hold on a sec.

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,042
Upsey-daisy, you can do it.

159
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,077
Where's she going?

160
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,612
Dunno.

161
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,813
I got a present for ya.

162
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,450
This is a little map of the
city and a reference letter.

163
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,619
Just give this to a
fella named Iceberg,

164
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,355
and I promise he'll
fix yer ship up good.

165
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,557
Water Seven's a
pretty confusing place,

166
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,692
be sure not to get lost.

167
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,494
You have a big
heart, don't you?!

168
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,229
We really owe you one!

169
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,102
[CHIMNEY] We'll be heading
back to Water Seven soon,

170
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,670
so maybe we'll see you there.

171
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,305
[KOKORO]
Sounds like a plan to me!

172
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,073
And if you like,
I can even give you folks

173
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,209
a tour of all my
favorite drinkin' holes!

174
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,543
Ha ha ha!

175
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,246
Sounds good! We'll try
to keep a look out for you!

176
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,648
It'll take 'bout a
week for the Log

177
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,216
to lock onto the next island,

178
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,319
so you'll have plenty of
time to do some sightseeing!

179
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,654
[LUFFY]
Great! Should be fun!

180
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,092
[LUFFY] Okay! Everyone
ready?! Time to set sail!

181
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,460
[CREW]
Yeah!

182
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,396
Thanks again for the map
and reference letter.

183
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,198
I sure am glad we
ran into you on the way!

184
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,539
[CHIMNEY]
Have a safe trip!

185
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,442
Better keep an eye out

186
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,078
for all those government
types down there!

187
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,647
[LUFFY]
Yahoo! Let's go!

188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,483
City of Meat,
here we come!

189
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,218
[USOPP] Did you forget
where we're going already?

190
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,041
[NAMI]
What a nice wind!

191
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,309
We might make it
out to Water Seven

192
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,178
even faster than I thought!

193
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,479
I'll be happy either way!

194
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,081
[SANJI] Don't worry
about finding a shipwright.

195
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,582
I got it all under control.

196
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,618
I'll get the hottest girl
in town, guaranteed.

197
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,286
What do I care if
the shipwright's hot?!

198
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
I want a huge, manly dude--like
even bigger than a bear!

199
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,590
16 feet tall!

200
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,626
A guy that size couldn't
even fit on the ship!

201
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,761
And who knows how much
food he would need to eat!

202
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,497
All that matters is
that he's good at his job.

203
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,199
If you ask me, the
real problem's gonna be

204
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,333
finding someone crazy enough

205
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,335
to go sailing with
a bunch of pirates.

206
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,302
Size doesn't matter!

207
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,405
I'm just glad we're
gonna make a new friend!

208
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,741
We're lucky we ran into
that train station on the way.

209
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,709
This map should be a big help!

210
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,678
All we have to do is
follow Kokoro's directions

211
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,714
to that Iceberg guy
and we're set!

212
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,449
I see.

213
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,817
Stupid drunk!

214
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,153
Whoa, looks like Luffy's art.

215
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,655
Okay, let's try to
find a shipwright

216
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,256
that looks
something like this!

217
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,392
If I saw a guy
like that, I'd run.

218
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,459
I wouldn't just run,

219
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:35,095
I'd jump into the sea to
get away from that freak.

220
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,530
But he looks like he
might be part-octopus,

221
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,632
so even that
might not save me.

222
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,701
Don't you have anything
better to talk about?

223
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,636
[NAMI] Okay everybody, since
we're gonna be at Water Seven

224
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,039
for a whole week, let me
give you your allowance.

225
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:48,509
[CHOPPER] Ooh! Me first!
Me first! Ah! Stop shoving!

226
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,512
[sounds of arguing]

227
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,615
[LUFFY and USOPP]
Allowance! Alowance! Allowance!

228
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,261
[LUFFY] Why're you hugging
the ship, Usopp?

229
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,663
I know all these tin plates
might not look like much to you,

230
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,600
but they bring back a lot
of fond memories for me.

231
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,069
I almost hate to see them go,
but it'll all be worth it

232
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,338
if the Merry can finally
get the repairs she needs!

233
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,139
[SANJI]
I feel the same way.

234
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,108
I'm proud of her battle
scars like anyone else,

235
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,243
but she's taken a real beating

236
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:24,411
since we've entered
the Grand Line.

237
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,581
The deck squeaks and we've got
leaks popping up everywhere.

238
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:28,715
Nobody wants to admit it,

239
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,285
but if we don't fix this soon,
we're as good as sunk.

240
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,786
[LUFFY] Yeah, but even if
we can't get a shipwright

241
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,155
for the crew, we still
have plenty of money!

242
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,423
We can do more
than just fix her;

243
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,092
we can power her up, too!

244
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,094
[USOPP] Ooh!
Then let's get more cannons!

245
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,063
[LUFFY]
Yeah! And a big statue!

246
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,198
[ZORO]
Hey, I think we're there.

247
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,198
Huh?

248
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,704
[LUFFY] He's right!
I can see Water Seven!

249
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,308
[LUFFY]
All right men, time to row!

250
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:55,309
[SANJI]
The wind's enough.

251
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:58,011
Don't wear us out
before we even get there.

252
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,322
Lovely.

253
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,525
Wow.

254
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,600
[LUFFY] Nobody told me
it was gonna be this cool!

255
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,373
[LUFFY] Whoa!
Check that thing out!

256
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,178
I didn't know they
made fountains that big!

257
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,179
OHHH!

258
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,115
That's nuts! I've never
seen anything like it!

259
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,784
And I thought the
sea train was a big deal.

260
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,786
Oh, wow. That's a lot of water!

261
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:43,357
Do you think it all
comes from the ocean?

262
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,491
That's what it seems like.

263
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,592
Then it pours out
of the fountain,

264
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,029
goes through the canals
and falls back into the sea.

265
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,134
Hey! Once we get there,

266
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,337
let's have a race on
those water slides!

267
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,704
Water slides?

268
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,412
I think I'll pass.

269
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,748
Even if that was a water slide,
you still can't swim.

270
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,316
Oh, good point.

271
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,283
By the way,

272
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,186
do you have any idea
what those numbers mean?

273
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,722
[USOPP]
Hmm... Good question.

274
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,791
[SANJI] They look like walls but
they could be some kinda gate.

275
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,493
Duh, those are
special entrances

276
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,562
where all the 16-foot
shipwrights go in.

277
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,064
How many of those guys do you
think there are out there?!

278
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,600
At any rate, that's
the station up front.

279
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:30,271
[NAMI] Must be the same one
Kokoro was talking about.

280
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,072
Still, I wonder
where the harbor's at?

281
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,074
Inside the town, maybe?

282
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,744
[FISHERMAN A]
Hey! Hold on!

283
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,345
Pirates shouldn't
sail in the front,

284
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,412
you gotta be more discreet!

285
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:43,350
Use the backstreet entrance
over there, instead!

286
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,552
[NAMI]
Oh, okay! Thank you!

287
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,261
Whoa. Look,
there's so many boats!

288
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,531
Awesome! The city's floating!
I wonder how it works?!

289
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,542
[CHOPPER] But everything's
flooded everywhere!

290
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,412
Aren't all the buildings
gonna be full of water, too?

291
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,514
Not at all. The houses
here were built

292
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,349
with a submerged
foundation in mind.

293
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,450
[CHOPPER]
Hmm?

294
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,386
If you look beneath the
walkway, you'll understand.

295
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,287
[CHOPPER]
You're right!

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,189
It's like the city's
sitting on stilts!

297
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,458
I see. Certainly
lives up to its name.

298
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:28,128
Hey, hurry up! Dock the ship!

299
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,066
Whoa, hold on a sec!

300
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,501
What do you pirates think
you're doing here in town?!

301
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,737
You're not looking to
plunder, now are you?

302
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,440
Nuh-uh! We just wanna
get our ship repaired!

303
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,675
[USOPP] He just asks that
like it's no big deal?

304
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,545
In that case there's a
little cape just ahead of here.

305
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,680
Anchor your ship
over there for now!

306
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,415
[NAMI]
Okay!

307
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,050
[LUFFY]
Thanks for the help!

308
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,218
[USOPP]
They keep waving us off.

309
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,454
[ZORO] Of course they do.
We're flying a pirate flag.

310
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:58,092
[USOPP] Should be okay
to anchor here, right?

311
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,326
[SANJI]
Can't see why not.

312
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,262
It's certainly far
enough from the city.

313
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,763
[LUFFY]
Works for me! Furl the sail!

314
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,039
[CREW cries out in surprise]

315
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:12,840
AAHHH!

316
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:14,608
Are you trying to
break the ship?!

317
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,278
No!! All I did was pull
the rope like I always do!

318
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:23,517
Holy crap! If the Merry's
falling apart this easy

319
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,685
we're lucky we
made it here at all!

320
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:28,722
By the way, they're not scared
of pirates here, are they?

321
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,357
Don't you think
that's kinda strange?

322
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,394
It's cause we're shipyard
customers just like anyone else.

323
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:36,063
Stop yapping and start
fixing the ship already!

324
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,665
They probably aren't
concerned about pirates

325
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:40,067
because they have enough
security to deal with them

326
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,001
if they misbehave.

327
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,736
Bet there's plenty
of Marines here, too.

328
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,471
Comes with the territory, huh?

329
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,040
What, are you kidding me?!

330
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,508
You mean they're gonna
have us arrested?!

331
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,642
I don't think
that'll be a problem,

332
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,578
since we're paying
customers and all.

333
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:51,812
[USOPP]
I guess so.

334
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:53,747
[LUFFY and USOPP] Well, that
settles it! We'll see you later!

335
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,582
Hold on one minute, you two!

336
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,052
[NAMI]
I need you to come with me

337
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,253
to take care of some business.

338
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:02,990
What business?

339
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,292
First off, we're going to
take Kokoro's reference letter

340
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,728
to this Iceberg guy--assuming
we can find him.

341
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,163
Hopefully, he'll be
able to take care of

342
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,698
the Merry's repairs for us.

343
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,499
After that, we'll
have to find a place

344
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,668
where we can trade in
our gold for some Berries.

345
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,270
[LUFFY]
Okeydokey. Works for me!

346
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,038
So what are
we waiting for?

347
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,441
Let's go! To Water Seven!

348
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,043
[NAMI] Okay, but aren't
you forgetting the gold?

349
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,183
[USOPP] Try to have that mast
fixed before we get back, Zoro!

350
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,119
[SANJI] Be careful out
there, Nami, Sweet!

351
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,522
Aww! It looks like I missed
my chance to go with them.

352
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,758
You can go with me
later, if you like.

353
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,561
Really?! Can we
go to a bookstore?

354
00:17:40,594 --> 00:17:43,163
Yes, of course.

355
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,734
[USOPP] Maybe we should trade in
the gold before anything else.

356
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,103
That's boring. I wanna
go to the shipyard.

357
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,204
It might not matter to you,

358
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,339
but I'd feel nervous
walking around a crowded city,

359
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,675
dragging a giant bag
of treasure behind me.

360
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,244
If we trade it, we'll still
be dragging Berries around.

361
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,712
I know, but it'll
be a lot smaller,

362
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,347
so people won't
notice it as much.

363
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,716
I mean, what if we
run into thieves?!

364
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,351
[LUFFY]
Ha! We are thieves!

365
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,654
Well, that's true
but if we cash it in,

366
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,722
you won't be the only
one carrying the money.

367
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,258
I don't know if
I like the sound of that.

368
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,761
It's almost like you don't
want me taking care of the gold!

369
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,497
Yep! Only you could
lose that much gold!

370
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,599
He already forgot
it once today.

371
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:21,435
[LUFFY] You guys don't
trust me, your own captain?!

372
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,569
[NAMI and USOPP]
Nope!

373
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,638
[LUFFY] Awww... Hey, that
really hurts my feelings!

374
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,607
I don't know if
I can keep sailing

375
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,043
with a crew that...
Wait, what's that?

376
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,477
[NAMI]
Huh. That's funny.

377
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,314
Is that the only
entrance to the city?

378
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,082
What's a rental bull shop?

379
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,016
[LUFFY]
Beats me.

380
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:38,218
Obviously they must
rent out something.

381
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:39,520
Yeah, but what's a bull?

382
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,489
I dunno like a bulldog?

383
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,556
That can't be right.

384
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,327
[LUFFY] Excuse me!
We'd like to rent some bulls!

385
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,229
Find out what
they are first!

386
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,398
[SHOP MAN A] Hi, looking
for some bulls, you said?

387
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,333
How many people?

388
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,234
We've got three.

389
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,335
[SHOP MAN A]
What kind would you like?

390
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,705
There's three ranks.
"Yagara," "Rabuka," and "King."

391
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:58,639
For your little group,

392
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,175
I'm thinking two
Yagaras will do just fine.

393
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,043
Gimme one rare
and one well-done.

394
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,045
You don't know what
you're saying, do you?!

395
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:08,115
[SHOP MAN A] Oh? You
followed a Log to get here?

396
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,049
[LUFFY]
Yep!

397
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:09,917
[SHOP MAN A]
That's quite an achievement,

398
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,118
but if you're not
from around here,

399
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,621
this is probably the first
time you've heard about bulls.

400
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,855
Uh-huh.

401
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,091
[SHOP MAN A] Well, to make a
long story short there they are!

402
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,627
Yagara bulls, you can
find them all over town.

403
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,229
As you can see, it's a
type of fish that swims

404
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,664
with its head above the water.

405
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:25,299
Since the whole city is flooded,

406
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,668
we have a lot more
canals than walkways.

407
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,503
Because of that,
pretty much everyone

408
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,772
here uses the bulls
in their daily life.

409
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,575
If you want to go sightseeing,
you'll need one too.

410
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,710
So they use the bulls
to pull those little boats?

411
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,213
Actually, the boat part's
mounted on their back.

412
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,048
In other words,
it's not much different

413
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,149
than riding
horseback on land.

414
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,454
Go ahead and take a look
at the bullpen over there

415
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,524
if you want to pick one out.
They don't bite.

416
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:54,528
It'll be 2,000 Berries for
two two-passenger Yagaras.

417
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,663
[NAMI]
They're cute!

418
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,767
They even look like horses!

419
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,470
Ugh! That's gross! What's
wrong with you, horse fish?!

420
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:07,140
Ha! Since that one seems to like
you, I'll mount him for you.

421
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,082
Is he all right
carrying heavy stuff?

422
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,817
Yeah, these guys
are built for power.

423
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,386
The people here use them
for moving all the time.

424
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,222
That's a big bag.
Can I ask what's inside?

425
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,156
[LUFFY]
Gold.

426
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,127
That's a good one. Well,
whatever it is, it'll be okay.

427
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,628
See?

428
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,696
Whoa! Gimme!

429
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,763
Yeah, right!

430
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,799
I guess he thought it was
worth asking, at least.

431
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,134
This is why I said I don't
trust you with the money!

432
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,537
I had to show him...
He didn't believe me!

433
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,639
Wow, I sure
wasn't expecting that.

434
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:39,840
Like I said,

435
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,376
that'll be one million Berries
for the two Yagara bulls.

436
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,378
Don't try to change
the price on us!

437
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,380
Oops, I mean 5 million Berries.

438
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,616
It went up even
more that time!

439
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,351
Ha ha ha!
Can't fool you!

440
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,453
I knew I'd have to
watch out for thieves...

441
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,288
[NAMI]
Here... 2,000 Berries.

442
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,556
[SHOP MAN A]
Thank you.

443
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,725
Speaking of gold, do you know
where we can get ours cashed in?

444
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,827
Well there's quite a few places,

445
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,196
but you'd probably
clean them all out trying

446
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,365
to trade in that much
treasure in one shot.

447
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,466
If I were you,

448
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,501
I'd check out downtown
on the shipbuilding island.

449
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,336
We're not really
familiar with the area.

450
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,272
Think you could give
us some directions?

451
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:13,107
It's right over there.

452
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,141
Here, take this.

453
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,376
Oh! A map!

454
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:17,911
Thanks for the help!

455
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,748
[LUFFY] Hey, we can find a
shipyard downtown too, right?

456
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,150
Yep! Best one in the world!

457
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,385
That'll be perfect.

458
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,352
We can head straight

459
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,354
to the shipyard soon
as we trade in our gold!

460
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,189
Well you're not gonna
hear any complaints from me.

461
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,325
As long as the Merry
gets repaired, I'll be happy!

462
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,693
Then we'll find a shipwright.

00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,062
Oh man, I can't wait!

464
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:35,729
Well?

00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,830
Shall we?

466
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:40,200
Yeah! Go Yagara!
