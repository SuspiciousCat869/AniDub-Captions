1
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,356
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,093
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,694
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,664
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,232
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,968
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,670
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,639
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,442
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,078
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:58,645
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,982
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,418
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,755
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,958
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,696
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,436
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,705
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,807
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,907
With help from Jimbei,

21
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,010
Luffy makes his way
to the scaffold,

22
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:33,280
only to be halted by the
Navy's three admirals.

23
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,548
When it seemed
all hope was lost,

24
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,850
Whitebeard and his men
joined the fray.

25
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,852
Now, an all-out
battle has broken out

26
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,890
between the Navy's elite and the
strongest pirates in the world!

27
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,559
Go Ice Block: Partisan!

28
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:50,130
--[AOKIJI] Hm?
--[JOZU grunts]

29
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,400
Go, I'll fight.

30
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,236
[WHITEBEARD]
I'm counting on you, son.

31
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,837
[pants]

32
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,405
[gasps]

33
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,141
[LUFFY groans]

34
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,879
[LUFFY groans]

35
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,017
[KIZARU]
Hmm.

36
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,021
You're full of
courage, aren't you?

37
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,956
But take this word of advice.

38
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,792
If you're simply
not strong enough,

39
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,460
you won't even come
close to saving him.

40
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,330
[panting]

41
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,233
[LUFFY groaning]

42
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,174
He's nothing but
a big-mouthed kid

43
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,842
who goes looking for trouble.

44
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,110
Dumb and clumsy.

45
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,645
Careless, too.

46
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,884
[WHITEBEARD] But I've got a
soft spot for fools like him.

47
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,954
[WHITEBEARD yells]

48
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,960
You. You're always sailing
around wreaking havoc.

49
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,696
But here, you're through!

50
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,233
[chuckles]

51
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,869
That's what you think.

52
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,172
[MARCO]
Hang on, Ace! I'm comin' for ya.

53
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,373
[MARCO grunts]

54
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,378
[GARP grunts]

55
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,516
[MARCO groans]

56
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,654
[GARP]
If you wanna reach the scaffold,

57
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,790
you're gonna have to
make it through me first!

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,030
[LUFFY] "The Power That Will
Shorten One's Life!

59
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,531
Energy Hormone, Redux!"

60
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,808
We're up against him, too?

61
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,111
The legendary hero, Garp?!

62
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,345
[PIRATES gasping]

63
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,815
He may be over the hill
now, but 20 years ago,

64
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,383
that guy went neck-and-neck
with Gold Roger!

65
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,520
He might be the strongest
Marine the Navy has ever seen!

66
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,892
[PIRATE AA]
He didn't just fight Gold Roger,

67
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,459
he beat his rival, too.

68
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,061
When Shiki the Golden Lion

69
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,263
launched his attack
on Marineford,

70
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,900
Garp was the one who
locked him up in Impel Down!

71
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,541
[PIRATES gasping]

72
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,377
We didn't make it
all the way here

73
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,580
just to lose to an old man!

74
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,816
Legends ain't nothin' but words!

75
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,752
[GARP chuckles]

76
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,687
I might say the same
thing to you, Whitebeard!

77
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,526
[grunts] Your glory days are
just a dying memory now!

78
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,695
Hound Blaze!

79
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,696
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

80
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,867
[MARINES gasping]

81
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,439
Damn. Are you gonna
destroy this entire city?

82
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,642
Send me the bill for
repairs when we're done.

83
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,515
This is ridiculous!
Just execute him!

84
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,851
All right, go and get a
substitute immediately!

85
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,852
[MARINE B]
Sir!

86
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,758
[PIRATE BB]
Make a path!

87
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,228
Keep pushing toward
the scaffold!

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,664
[PIRATES shouting]

89
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,099
[PIRATES gasping]

90
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,639
Ironic, I know, but I
forgot about those things!

91
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,543
No more lasers for
today! That's enough!

92
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,678
Did you think we were weaklings?

93
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,880
We're from the New World!

94
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,656
[PIRATE CC]
Now's our chance!

95
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,357
[PIRATE DD]
Get to the scaffold!

96
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,897
[IVANKOV]
How is he?

97
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,965
He is'nt good!

98
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,468
First aid isn't going
to cut it, I'm afraid.

99
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,669
We gotta get him
outta here, and fast.

100
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,706
[IVANKOV] The odds were
against him from the start,

101
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,640
but this is too cruel.

102
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,675
He's so close.

103
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,556
[SENGOKU]
Hm?

104
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,693
[SENGOKU]
A final moment of regret?

105
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,963
[GARP grunts]

106
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,732
[GARP]
Poor boy.

107
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,144
[THUG A]
Gold Roger?

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,984
[THUG A] Yeah, of course I know
who he is, but who gives a crap?

109
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,719
People talk like he's
something special,

110
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,254
but what did he even do?

111
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,456
He just riled up
a bunch of criminals!

112
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,526
And thanks to that bastard,
the entire world is screwed up.

113
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,793
And what does that mean?

114
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,696
There's no way
you're that stupid.

115
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,697
Everyone knows before
he was executed

116
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,933
he told some BS story
about hidden treasure

117
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,768
to give the middle finger
to the Government.

118
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,337
But either way, it worked,
'cause a bunch of dumb pirates

119
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,773
bought into the whole
thing and went nuts.

120
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,941
Don't you get it?

121
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,477
He left behind a stain
people still can't clean up.

122
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,846
Even killing the
bastard wasn't enough.

123
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,913
Now, thanks to him,

124
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,816
we gotta put up with a
bunch of human garbage

125
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:11,384
pissing on everyone else,
following his lead.

126
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,721
He's the biggest piece
of crap who ever lived.

127
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,057
He stinks even after
we flushed him!

128
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,358
Just like you, kid!

129
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,594
[THUGS laughing]

130
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,563
[ACE grunts]

131
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,697
[THUG A]
Huh?

132
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,499
[ACE growling]

133
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,869
Aw, did I hurt your
wittle feelings?

134
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,537
Are you in the Roger Fan Club?

135
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,473
You got something
you wanna say, kid?

136
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,341

00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,077

[THUGS gasping, groaning]

139
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,892
[DADAN]
You startin' trouble again, Ace?

140
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,927
What was it this time?

141
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,731
[DADAN] Everyone's making
a fuss about some thugs

142
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,300
that got beat near
to death by a kid.

143
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,870
That's too bad.

144
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,638
I was hoping they would die.

145
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,240
[DADAN]
Don't gimme that!

146
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,108
You realize when you
pull this kind of crap,

147
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:10,845
I'm the one who gets
chewed out for it, right?

148
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,712
Hey, are you listening?

149
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,815
[DADAN]
Honestly!

150
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,617
I don't know what that
old fool was thinkin',

151
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,986
leavin' a boy like you with me!

152
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,920
What?

153
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,289
You want me to
tell you about Roger?

154
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,491
[SUIT A]
Huh.

155
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,330
He was a liar.

156
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,166
And a murderer and
miserable thief to boot!

157
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,701
Only jackasses believe his crap.

158
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,270
[SUIT B] King of the Pirates,
King of the Chumps,

159
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,538
he's dead either way!

160
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,639
[SUIT A]
Got that right!

161
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,541
[SUITS laugh]

162
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,378
[MAN B grunts]
Roger, huh?

163
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,048
I'm trying to enjoy a
drink over here, kid.

164
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,416
The man was a hack.

165
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,886
Now piss off!

166
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,054
Hear me? Beat it, kid!

167
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,255
Huh? [groans]

168
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,523
[CROWD gasps]

169
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,992
[MAN A] Hey! What do think
you're doing, you little punk?!

170

[GARP laughing]

171
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,535
[GARP] "I should see
the other guy," right?

172
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,511
Look, Ace.

173
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,980
You can't keep
doin' this, kiddo.

174
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,687
So your grandson.

175
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,255
He's around my age, huh?

176
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,424
Huh?

177
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,194
Do you think he's
happy with himself?

178
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,929
Luffy? I think he is.

179
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:39,467
The boy's growin' up
in fine feather.

180
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,468
Old man.

181
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,068
Yeah?

182
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,540
[ACE]
Tell me the truth.

183
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,845
Did I deserve to be born,
or was it just a mistake?

184
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,246
[GARP]
Hm?

185
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,521
[GARP]
That's not for me to say.

186
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,924
You just keep livin'
and hope you find out.

187
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,567
[IVANKOV] Quick, carry
Straw Boy back to the ship!

188
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,601
[IVANKOV]
It's not ideal,

189
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,271
but we'll have to save
Ace Boy without him.

190
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:18,105
[LUFFY grunts]

191
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,806
[IVANKOV]
Huh?

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,841
[LUFFY]
Iva...

193
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,610
[IVANKOV gasps]

194
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,077
Calm down, take it easy!

195
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,047
[panting]

196
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,284
I need one last favor from you.

197
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,952
[IVANKOV]
Huh?

198
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,389
[PIRATE FF]
We're coming for you, Ace!

199
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,124
We're taking you home!

200
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,759
[PIRATE GG]
The Navy never stood a chance!

201
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,797
[ACE]
This is wrong.

202
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,733
Dammit!

203
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:49,937
[JIMBEI grunts]

204
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,872
[MARINE D groans]

205
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,676
My friend. Don't lose hope.

206
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,311
I swear I shall save your life,

207
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,479
no matter how much
blood is spilled!

208
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,015
We're almost there!

209
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,685
[HARUTA grunts]
There's no stopping us now!

210
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,254
[PIRATES shouting]

211
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,589
[PIRATE HH] Don't let
them get you down, Ace!

212
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,692
[PIRATE II]
Yeah, we won't leave you!

213
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,927
[PIRATE JJ] We're brothers!
We stick together!

214
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,930
[PIRATES yelling]

215
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,899
[ACE]
Damn it, this all wrong.

216
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,569
How the hell am I
supposed to feel?

217
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,138
Pops. Luffy. My friends.

218
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,606
They're here to save me, but

219
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,909
they're pushing through a sea
of their own blood to do it!

220
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,644
Don't say "one last" anything.

221
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,412
We're getting out of
here alive, darn it!

222
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,016
[panting]

223
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,051
You know what I need.

224
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,685
[IVANKOV]
Hm?

225
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,222
I'm sick.

226
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,623
These are tears of joy!

227
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:51,331
Even after all I've done,
I want to live!

228
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,035
[LUFFY grunts]

229
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,605
Iva... Help me...

230
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,708
You realize what the
repercussions of this would be,

231
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:02,876
don't you?

232
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,981
[panting]

233
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:29,670
[PRISONER AA]
Captain Buggy!

234
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,771
[PRISONER BB]
He's awake!

235
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,972
[PRISONER CC]
He's alive!

236
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,208
[PRISONER DD]
I knew it all along!

237
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,110
Huh? Aw jeez,
what happened? We okay?

238
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,647
Aokiji just froze you solid!
It was really freaky!

239
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,156
[PRISONER A]
Captain Buggy!

240
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,625
[PRISONER EE]
Oh, no! It's too late!

241
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,861
[PRISONER A] No! He was
so beautiful! So perfect!

242
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,698
He was gonna conquer
the world, damn it! The world!

243
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,072
[PRISONERS yelling]

244
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,339
Oh, no!

245
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:11,078
[PRISONERS shouting]

246
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,113
[screams] Hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot!

247
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,115
[PRISONERS gasp]

248
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,216
He got hit by the ice
attack on purpose

249
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,886
so he could show us how to
unfreeze everyone else!

250
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,654
Even when he's frozen solid,

251
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,422
he's still thinking
of his friends!

252
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:25,760
Quick! Let's thaw out the other
guys before it's too late!

253
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,194
Okay!

254
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,963
Hey, drowning over here!

255
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:33,133
Might want to rescue
your savior first!

256
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,869
Remember, I can't swim! Help!

257
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,306
[PRISONERS]
Captain Buggy!

258
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,508
We were blinded by
your godlike glory

259
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,777
and forgot about the
whole Devil Fruit thing!

260
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,046
[PRISONER B]
You've saved us so many times.

261
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,683
And we almost let
you down! I'm sorry!

262
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,284
Sue me, I'm not omnipotent.

263
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,620
But as long as you still
worship me, we're good!

264
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,556
[BUGGY laughs]

265
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:59,527
[BUGGY] Looks like I've still
got my luck and my lackeys.

266
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,429
By the way, where did
Mr. 3 run off to?

267
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,732
I'm not sure. The last
time we saw him was

268
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:06,233
before those walls
trapped us in here

269
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,935
and everything went to hell.

270
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,670
[BUGGY] That little rat!
He made it out, didn't he?

271
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,007
Huh? You mean these walls?

272
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,742
With the cannons?

273
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,043
[PRISONER A]
The Navy lured everyone in,

274
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,878
then trapped them
with these things.

275
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,881
After that, it was ice and
meteors and boiling water

276
00:16:20,915 --> 00:16:23,350
and, well, we're trapped.

277
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,618
Oh, are we?

278
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,887
Because the Great Captain
Buggy wouldn't have made it

279
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,022
this far in life if he'd
surrendered every time

280
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:32,026
he ran into a
measly wall or two!

281
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,828
Do you hear that, Navy?

282
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,462
Buggy's comin' for ya!

283
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,566
No walls, ice, or giant
magma fists can stop me!

284
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,800
Awesome!

285
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,835
You've only been defrosted,
like, a couple of minutes,

286
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,437
but you're like,
"Bam! Let's do it!"

287
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,071
That's how I roll.

288
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,776
[BUGGY]
Okay, seriously, now what?

289
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:52,045
Better move, magma punk!

290
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:55,849
[WHITEBEARD groans]

291
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:56,617
[MARCO gasps]

292
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,855
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

293
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,494
Son of a--

294
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,262
[HARUTA, PIRATE F]
Are you okay?

295
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,701
The ravages of time
humble us all.

296
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,204
Yes, even you!

297
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,973
Screw the fight, this is
what I was afraid of!

298
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,610
I don't want no sympathy--

299
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,114
There's no way I'm wearing this
crap in front of my enemies!

300
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,182
[MARCO]
Damn it, Pops!

301
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,250
[KIZARU]
Huh.

302
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:33,653
Wouldn't turn your back
on me, if I were you.

303
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,624
[MARCO groans]

304
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,225
Marco!

305
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,762
You gonna make the same mistake?

306
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,999
[JOZU groans]

307
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,500
Jozu!

308
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:51,371
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

309
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:53,807
[AKAINU]
Someone has to see you off.

310
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,444
And that duty seems
to have fallen on me.

311
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,112
[AKAINU grunts]

312
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,220
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

313
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,089
Pops, no!

314
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,058
Whoa, not good.

315
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,394
Aw, crap.

316
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,328
[COBY pants]

317
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,529
[HELMEPPO]
Hey!

318
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:18,098
It's a little late for
a change of heart now!

319
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,600
No offense, but they
don't need you anymore.

320
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,270
I mean, I think we all know
the Navy's got this one.

321
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,705
Akainu got Whitebeard,

322
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:25,973
Kizaru took out Marco,

323
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,942
and Aojiki froze Jozu.

324
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,443
You wouldn't kick a
man while he's down,

325
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:32,345
so don't run out there
just to pick up scraps.

326
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,782
And if you were looking
to test yourself

327
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:37,384
against Straw Hat
again, he's out, too.

328
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,786
Even the strongest pirates
in the world got stomped.

329
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,455
Good to know we're on the
winning team this time.

330
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:48,862
Because I promised myself
that I'll keep trying...

331
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,096
...till...

332
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,767
...till I become
a Marine admiral!

333
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,903
[COBY gasps]

334
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,070
[COBY]
No.

335
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,807
I-I'm sorry, I got carried away!

336
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,141
This is so embarrassing.

337
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,377
I just wanna dig a hole
and bury my head in it!

338
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,778
That was really arrogant of me.

339
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,080
I got worked up after
seeing you again and I just--

340
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,682
[LUFFY]
Coby.

341
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,817
You said you're gonna
fight me, right?

342
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,920
Then you will
become that strong.

343
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,488
You'll have to.

344
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,525
[COBY] I'm so ashamed of
myself, even thinking that.

345
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,395
It was obviously a pipe
dream from the start.

346
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,830
Even with all his strength,

347
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,833
Luffy couldn't make
his dream come true.

348
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,635
But at least he fought.

349
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,503
All I've done is run!

350
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:32,806
I don't even pass as a Navy
soldier, let alone an admiral!

351
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,074
It's useless!

352
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:35,176
I'm useless!

353
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,244
C'mon, you should be happy!

354
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:39,613
Our team just scored
a massive victory!

355
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:40,847
I bet they'll throw a party!

[IVANKOV]
Another hormone shot?

359
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,623
Do you want to die?

360
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,892
You're past your limit!

361
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,028
I'm sorry, kid, but you've
been burning your candle

362
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:56,930
at both ends for too long!

363
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:59,800
Have you forgotten that
poison you suffered through?

364
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,168
You cheated death once!

365
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:04,171
I didn't save you so you
could destroy yourself!

366
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,173
I told you this last time.

367
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,408
My hormones aren't
a magic fix-me-up

368
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,544
you could take every time
something goes wrong!

369
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,013
I want to save Ace Boy
just like you,

370
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:16,683
but If you keep misusing my
power like this, you'll die!

I'm begging you,
you have to let me fight!

Guys, I think Pops is down!

[LUFFY grunts]

382
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,283
[LUFFY]
If I don't keep fighting...

383
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:53,453
...and they kill Ace 'cause
I wasn't there for him...

384
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,990
...then I'd rather
be dead anyway!

[IVANKOV gasps]

386
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,297

You dummy!

389
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,218
Whatever would I tell
your dear old dad, Dragon,

390
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:28,522
if I let you die like a dog due
to my deadly Devil Fruit power?

391
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,691
This stubbornness of
yours is not cute at all!

Where's the replacement?

394
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,169
What could possibly
be taking him so long?

395
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:43,303
[EXECUTIONER A]
Well, it was short notice

396
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:45,939
and we don't do this very often.

397
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,375
Hey, you ready?

398
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,110
Fine, let's move!

[LUFFY yelling]

409
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,218
He got back up!

No way!

Kizaru hit him dead-on.

414
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,358
It's a miracle he's even alive,

415
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,894
let alone getting up
and screaming like that!

think you're going?

Luffy dashes forward,
heedless of his injuries.

428
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,535
Yet even with his
sudden strength,

429
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,906
he still faces a wall of Marines
blocking the path to Ace.

430
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,375
Among them, an old friend
appears for a reunion

431
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,944
neither of them expected
to come so soon.

432
