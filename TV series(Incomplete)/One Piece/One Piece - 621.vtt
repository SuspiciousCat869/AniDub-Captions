00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.165
What gives? Where's the gas?

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:57.067
[FRANKY]
So you finally showed up.

00:14:57.101 --> 00:14:59.236
I was getting tired of waiting.

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:01.138
[gasps]

00:15:02.439 --> 00:15:04.274
[LUFFY]
You seein' what I'm seein'?

00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:05.275
[CHOPPER screams]

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:06.777
[USOPP]
The General's so cool!

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.911
[ALL]
What?

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:11.615
[FRANKY]
Aww! Super!

00:15:11.648 --> 00:15:12.850
It's a robot!

00:15:12.883 --> 00:15:14.351
Like a big toy!

00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:15.986
Wow! Amazing!

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:18.589
Truly the stuff of dreams!

00:15:18.622 --> 00:15:20.591
Right?

00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:27.197
[LAW]
Hm?

00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:31.535
Buffalo! Baby 5!

00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:32.703
What're you doing here?

00:15:32.736 --> 00:15:34.638
Us? And what d'you
think you're doing

00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:37.007
helping the Straw Hats
and kids escape?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.143
'Cuz Law's turned traitor!

00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:41.311
Joker saved the
heart seat for you,

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:42.880
and you go and betray him!

00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:46.683
Wait, are they your
friends or something?

00:15:47.618 --> 00:15:51.021
Negative. They're my enemies!

00:16:01.832 --> 00:16:04.902
[BUFFALO] All of the Straw Hats
and the Navy G-5 against us?

00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:07.271
Those are losing odds!
We gotta split!

00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:09.807
Wait! Baby 5! What's going on?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.141
Why are you here?

00:16:11.175 --> 00:16:14.511
Saving you! We're taking
you to the Young Master!

00:16:14.545 --> 00:16:16.947
They grabbed Caesar
and made a run for it!

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.549
You know what that means!

00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:21.552
It's a sniper's job
to take 'em down!

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:23.687
[LAW]
Those bastards!

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.756
Hold up, Law!

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:28.659
Usopp said he's got a handle
on the situation, didn't he?

00:16:28.692 --> 00:16:30.060
A first class sniper.

00:16:30.093 --> 00:16:31.628
Don't underestimate him.

00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:33.530
Even if his schnoz is giant.

00:16:33.564 --> 00:16:35.833
The last part wasn't
necessary, Zoro!

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:37.835
You're crazy! What if he misses?

00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:40.003
If Caesar escapes,
this whole plan is ruined!

00:16:40.037 --> 00:16:42.272
[NAMI]
Are we an alliance or aren't we?

00:16:42.306 --> 00:16:43.707
If we're gonna work together,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.709
how about showing
a little trust?

00:16:45.742 --> 00:16:48.378
[ZORO]
Hm? What alliance? Hang on!

00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:51.148
Don't think so.
I'm done waiting.

00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:55.185
I want on the offense!

00:16:56.253 --> 00:16:57.721
Think you got away?

00:16:57.754 --> 00:16:59.423
Think again, cowards!

00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:02.359
You're all going down!

00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:03.560
That's right!

00:17:03.594 --> 00:17:05.562
'Specially when they're wounded
and their backs're to us!

00:17:05.596 --> 00:17:07.197
Too easy!

00:17:12.302 --> 00:17:14.404
Yeah. Any day.

00:17:14.438 --> 00:17:18.542
First, you need a
little water. [chuckles]

00:17:18.575 --> 00:17:21.345
Now, work your magic!

00:17:21.378 --> 00:17:23.580
It's time to grow!

00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:27.451
Black Kabuto and Chomp-Grass!

00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:30.320
Eat up! You're gonna need it!

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.065
[BABY 5] It looks like
they're about to attack!

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:43.400
Be careful, Buffalo!

00:17:43.433 --> 00:17:44.902
Leave the flyin' to me!

00:17:44.935 --> 00:17:48.038
While I'm busy,
you keep the skies clear.

00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:49.706
We got a mission to complete!

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.442
[BABY 5]
What? Roger that!

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:55.779
My, you really
need me, don't you?

00:17:55.812 --> 00:17:57.014
Then I'll be there.

00:17:57.047 --> 00:17:58.882
I'll protect you with my life!

00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:02.452
Go high! Weather egg!

00:18:03.987 --> 00:18:05.856
Something just flew overhead!

00:18:05.889 --> 00:18:09.259
Time to hatch. Little Bolt!

00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:26.743
A thunderstorm?

00:18:29.112 --> 00:18:31.415
[BABY 5]
Buffalo! We gotta go!

00:18:31.448 --> 00:18:33.684
[BUFFALO]
I'm trying! I'm trying!

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:38.855
Oh no. Not so fast!

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:40.057
[BUFFALO gasps]

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.826
Meteorology Attack!

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:45.329
Thunder Breed...

00:18:47.264 --> 00:18:50.067
[BABY 5 screams]

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.368
No way!

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:52.169
[NAMI]
...Tempo!

00:18:52.202 --> 00:18:56.406
[BUFFALO, BABY 5 scream]

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:04.281
Say somethin', Baby!

00:19:04.314 --> 00:19:07.484
Damn it! She's out cold!

00:19:14.024 --> 00:19:15.993
Time to wrap this up!

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:18.595
Do it, Chomp Grass!

00:19:18.628 --> 00:19:22.199
Special Attack...
Meteor Storm Assault!

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.102
[USOPP]
Fire!

00:19:26.937 --> 00:19:29.039
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Buffalo! I can't move!

00:19:29.072 --> 00:19:30.507
Or fly for that matter!

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.309
Please, you gotta protect me!

00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:35.479
I always perform my duty.

00:19:35.512 --> 00:19:38.749
I'm part of the
Don Quixote family!

00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:41.184
The mission above all else!

00:19:49.593 --> 00:19:50.694
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Thanks, idiot!

00:19:50.727 --> 00:19:52.029
Ya good-for-nothin'!

00:19:52.062 --> 00:19:54.765
Go on! Try it! I'm gas!

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:56.666
You can't hit me!

00:19:58.068 --> 00:19:59.803
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Gotta make it to Dressrosa!

00:19:59.836 --> 00:20:02.472
With or without
Buffalo and Baby 5!

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.341
[USOPP]
Nope. Afraid not.

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:06.676
That last shot...

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.746
No! What is this? [screams]

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.281
[USOPP] ...was Sea
Prism Stone handcuffs!

00:20:11.314 --> 00:20:13.850
[CAESAR CLOWN groans]

00:20:13.884 --> 00:20:16.053
[USOPP]
And that is how it's done!

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:18.221
[ALL cheer]

00:20:18.255 --> 00:20:20.857
[BOTH]
Yeah! In your face, Caesar!

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.128
Heh.

00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:28.532
When the enemy turns
their back, I'm there.

00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:29.433
When the enemy--

00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:31.001
Yeah. We get it.

00:20:39.643 --> 00:20:44.014
Fine. Looks like the initial
phase is accomplished.

00:20:44.047 --> 00:20:47.050
Told ya. Pretty strong,
aren't they?

00:21:25.322 --> 00:21:27.657
[DOFLAMINGO]
All right, brats.

00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:30.961
See you soon!

00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:43.807
[AOKIJI sighs]

00:21:56.987 --> 00:22:00.490
[AOKIJI groans]
Looks like I overslept.

00:22:00.524 --> 00:22:02.492
No big deal.

00:22:03.293 --> 00:22:04.494
Now then.

00:22:04.528 --> 00:22:06.930
Which way's Punk Hazard?

00:22:14.104 --> 00:22:16.173
[NARRATOR] After a fierce
battle, the Straw Hats finally

00:22:16.206 --> 00:22:19.476
claim victory and capture
the mad scientist Caesar.

00:22:19.509 --> 00:22:22.312
However, just as the survivors
are licking their wounds

00:22:22.345 --> 00:22:25.148
and preparing to set sail
far from Punk Hazard,

00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:27.784
something unexpected
happens to Kin'emon,

00:22:27.817 --> 00:22:30.053
a victim of the
Land of the Dead.

00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:31.955
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:31.988 --> 00:22:35.592
"A Touching Reunion!
Momonosuke and Kin'emon!"

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:38.795
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
