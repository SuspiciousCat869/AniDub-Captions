1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,097
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,007
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,141
[NARRATOR]
Eneru and Luffy finally clashed

25
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,018
on the Ark Maxim.

26
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:39,607
You! You're no mere mortal!
What are you?

27
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:44,529
Me? I'm Luffy. A pirate.
And a rubber man.

28
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:46,698
[grunts]
What?

29
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,075
[NARRATOR] Discovering that his
lightning powers had no effect

30
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,077
on a rubber person,
for the first time,

31
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:52,954
Eneru found himself threatened.

32
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:56,374
Gloam... Paddling!

33
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,544
[LUFFY]
Huh?

34
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:14,309
Gum-Gum... Battle Axe!

35
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:28,531
[NARRATOR]
The battle intensified.

36
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,533
And fueled by Eneru's power,

37
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:33,912
the golden Ark Maxim
finally took flight.

38
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:39,918
[ENERU laughs] The circuit to
this ark's ultimate function

39
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,672
has been initiated and is now
running at full capacity!

40
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:47,092
It has a name.
It's called Deathpiea.

41
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,886
The despair that will
destroy this world.

42
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:01,523
[VILLAGERS shout]

43
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:06,111
So being a god... makes it
okay to destroy everything?

44
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,029
Gum-Gum...

45
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:10,573
...Bazooka!

46
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,992
Gum-Gum...

47
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:17,288
...Rifle!

48
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,583
[shouts]

49
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,380
[gasps]

50
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:38,309
[LUFFY] "Luffy Falls! Eneru's
Judgment and Nami's Wish!"

51
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,775
[pants]

52
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:01,750
Oh, no! The ships
leaving the Vearth!

53
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,960
[gasps]

54
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:08,340
[AISA] What are we gonna do?
It's gonna fly away!

55
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:12,302
It worked! You did it!

56
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,970
Eneru's down!

57
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:17,766
[pants]

58
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,392
[NAMI]
But... wait!

59
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,603
The ship's taking off!

60
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:33,239
Oh, no way.
He's getting back up!

61
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:37,577
[ENERU] You fools!
Is that the best you can do?

62
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,287
[ENERU coughs]

63
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,709
[ENERU]
Make no mistake, boy!

64
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,587
When you're gone,
the world will be mine!

65
00:05:51,257 --> 00:05:54,427
[ENERU] And once again,
everyone will fear me,

66
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,347
worship me, and revere me!

67
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,266
I am all-powerful!

68
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,563
In this world, filth like you
must learn the only truth.

69
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:11,319
By my hand, nothing is
ever impossible!

70
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:20,078
[ENERU]
For I am the Almighty God!

71
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:23,665
[VILLAGERS yelling, shouting]

72
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:25,041
Hey, look!

73
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,919
Up in the sky, something
floating over Upper Yard!

74
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:30,296
It's a... ship!

75
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,716
[CITIZEN A]
A flying ship? Impossible!

76
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,718
I've never heard
of such a thing!

77
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,476
[CITIZEN C] That's what
made the sky turn dark?

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,563
[CITIZEN D]
God is on that ship!

79
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:47,897
[yelps]

80
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:52,193
[CITIZEN B gasps]
Hey! You gotta get outta here!

81
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,571
[CITIZEN A]
Board the ships!

82
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,660
[FEMALE SHANDORIAN A]
Vessels are leaving Angel Island

83
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:02,370
by the hundreds!

84
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:09,169
What evil is this? Those dark
clouds are an ominous sign.

85
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,630
Look! Someone is
coming this way!

86
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,841
[CITIZEN E]
Shandorians!

87
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:18,261
Take heed! Ready your
ships and evacuate!

88
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:21,014
The sky islands are doomed!

89
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,057
They're what?!

90
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,683
You have to escape!

91
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,143
To the Sea!

92
00:07:25,226 --> 00:07:27,437
Not... the Blue Sea?

93
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,780
[ROBIN]
A ship.

94
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,532
It's him... Eneru.

95
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:51,544
Look hard, rubber boy.

96
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,464
On a falling island's despair.

97
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,096
[ENERU]
Skypeia will be destroyed,

98
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:04,307
the angels' lives extinguished.

99
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:08,019
No one can stop me. Heh.

100
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,021
[ENERU]
Not even you!

101
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,690
[gasps]
Wanna bet?

102
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,608
[ENERU]
Gloam...!

103
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,984
The golden wall!

104
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,070
No you don't!

105
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:18,405
[ENERU]
...Paddling!

106
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,656
Ah! Hot! Hot! Hot!

107
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:22,117
[gasps]
He melted it like butter!

108
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,747
[LUFFY] Yowtch! It burns!
It burns! It burns!

109
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,374
[NAMI]
Luffy!

110
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:33,169
[LUFFY yells]
It won't come off!

111
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,255
What's the matter,
rubber man?

112
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,882
Don't you like the way
I've evened the odds?

113
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,427
I've simply taken
the fight out of you.

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,430
[LUFFY grunts]
Get this off of me!

115
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:47,892
You see, I'm honestly not sure I
could take another hit from you.

116
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,519
[grunting]

117
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,771
[ENERU]
Therefore...

118
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,025
...I think it best
if we sever ties.

119
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:58,361
But in honor of the spirited
effort you've put forth,

120
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,614
take this gold bauble
as a parting gift!

121
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:05,201
[LUFFY yells]

122
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:08,788

[grunts]

125
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:24,220
[LUFFY yells, grunts]

126
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,764
Luffy!

127
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:32,354
Once I'm finally rid of you,
this world will be mine again!

128
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,481
[LUFFY grunts]

129
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:36,733
Just as it was before.

130
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:40,445
And not a soul in the
world can defeat me!

131
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:42,364
Not a soul in the world?

132
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,366
Hmph.

133
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:48,953
You're an idiot! Even if
I can't defeat you,

134
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:51,790
back in the Blue Sea,
there are tons more fighters

135
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:54,250
who can put you
in your place!

136
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,419
Someone like you could never--

137
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,004
[LUFFY gasps]

138
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,548
You talk too much, boy.

139
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,553
[ENERU] Now fall!
Fall along with the sky island!

140
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,222
You won't win!

141
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:09,766
No!

142
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,687
No!

143
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,775
[LUFFY yells]

144
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:21,695
Luffy...

00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:23,655
Eneru!

00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,031
[whimpers]

147
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:29,494
Horsey-Bird, look!
That's Luffy! He's falling!

148
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:31,121
[PIERRE yells]

149
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,205
[NAMI gasps]

150
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:36,042
Oh no. Aisa and Pierre!

151
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,544
--[ENERU] Aisa.
--[NAMI gasps]

152
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:41,756
So that sly, little voice I've
been hearing has a name.

153
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,011
Fight me, you coward!

154
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:49,764
[AISA]
Luffy! We're coming to save you!

155
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:50,765
[PIERRE crows]

156
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:54,602
I tire of this. Time to die!

157
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:58,106
Aisa! Pierre!
He's gonna shoot you!

158
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,942
Eneru!

159
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:05,155
[ENERU]
God's Judgment!

160
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:07,657
El... Thor!

161
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,173
Luffy!

162
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:27,719
Aisa! Pierre!

163
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,661
Luffy. Aisa...

164
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,955
[ENERU laughs]

165
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:58,750
For all my strength, he hurt me.

166
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,670
The rubber runt was
quite a challenge.

167
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:05,715
Yet, here I stand, the victor.

168
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,008
[grunts]

169
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,811
It's enormous.

170
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,146
[CONIS]
So, this is the ark

171
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,024
the Divine Squad
was forced to build.

172
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:30,782
[NAMI] Right here. On the
northeastern edge of the island.

173
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,534
After the others get the gold,

174
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:34,536
this is where we're all
supposed to meet up.

175
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,287
And once all of you
are together again,

176
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,581
you're planning
to escape, right?

177
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:40,417
As long as we
have the treasure!

178
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,753
I'm not going anywhere
without it! Heh!

179
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,548
[CONIS gasps]
Nami.

180
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,008
[CONIS]
They're heading northeast

181
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,927
towards theseashore. No doubt
returning to their ship.

182
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,471
The smartest thing right
now is go on ahead

183
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,098
and wait for them to show up.

184
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:58,518
Afterall, they'll need me to
guide them back to the Blue Sea!

185
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,146
I'm their best chance
to escape the island!

186
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,735
[CONIS] But I have to get to
the Going Merry, and fast!

187
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,575
[SANJI exhales] I just had
the most amazing dream.

188
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:16,578
Yeah, it was all about you.

189
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:21,082
Nami, my sweetness. You and I
wandered paradise together

190
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,251
tasting forbidden fruit.

191
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,296
Don't wake me. Let us
stay trapped in this

192
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:30,175
passionate utopia
for all eternity.

193
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,551
Nami.

194
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,763
[USOPP sighs]
You smell nice.

195
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,389
[SANJI yelps]

196
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,350
[SANJI]
No! It's not fair!

197
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,603
One minute I'm dreaming,
the next I'm in a nightmare!

198
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,271
Wait. Hold on.

199
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,524
Speaking of, where is she?

200
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,401
[grunts]

201
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:50,111
Nami?

202
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:53,323
[SANJI gasps]

203
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,701
What... What is that?

204
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,375
[gasps]

205
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,336
[SANJI RADAR VOICE] Mellorine.
Mellorine, Mellorine, Mellorine,

206
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,421
Mellorine, Mellorine, Mellorine,
Mellorine, Mellorine, Mellorine.

207
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,632
[SANJI gasps]
Nami!

208
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,550
She's in trouble!

209
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,595
[SUU whimpers]

210
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,681
[SANJI]
Hey, Usopp! Wake up!

211
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:21,017
This is no time to be
in bed, you idiot!

212
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:25,230
[USOPP grunts]
What is it? What's wrong?

213
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,315
Never mind that. Let's go!

214
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,734
[USOPP]
Huh? Go where?

215
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:32,278
Where d'you think?
To rescue Nami.

216
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,532
Rescue, huh? Um...

217
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:38,159
[gasps] Oh yeah, it's all
comin' back to me!

218
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,078
I-I remember everything!

219
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,830
[groans]

220
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:47,293
[USOPP yelps]

221
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:50,255
[grunts]

222
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,718
No. God came!

223
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,386
--Oh, nice, I angered a God!
--[SANJI] Would you relax?

224
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,013
He's long gone by now.

225
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,723
[USOPP] ...how can I
get myself smotted?

226
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,016
[SANJI]
It's Nami who's in trouble!

227
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,351
She's the one who got kidnapped!

228
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,602
Nami?

229
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:07,272
[SANJI grunts] How could
we have been so stupid?

230
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:11,276
This is all our fault!
She's too cute for this!

231
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,406
Okay, so he took her...
But where to?

232
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:17,741
[SANJI grunts]

233
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:20,326
[SANJI]
There!

234
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,327
[USOPP]
Huh?

235
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,788
[USOPP gasps]

236
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:27,709
It's big! Big ship! Flying!

237
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,211
Though I only saw
her for a second,

238
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,298
I'm sure it was
Nami on that ship.

239
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:37,510
And while I may not know
what dangers lie ahead,

240
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,763
at least she's not wearing
that t-shirt anymore!

241
00:15:39,846 --> 00:15:43,016
Again with the t-shirt? Focus!

242
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:45,435
I feel like I'm missing
something here.

243
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:48,813
Where're Conis, Weird Knight
and the others?

244
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,150
I don't know.
But we have to hurry.

245
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,615
[SUU whines]

246
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:03,495
[USOPP]
Hey, Sanji! Where ya going?

247
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,580
[SANJI]
To that ship! Where else?

248
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:07,374
[USOPP]
Say what?!

249
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,294
Run faster or we'll lose'em!
My love needs us!

250
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,380
[USOPP] Yeah, so um,
if I'm following you,

251
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,048
does that mean I'm going too?

252
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,342
[SANJI] Of course! I need
your help to get on board!

253
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:19,219
You still have that rope you
shoot outta your belly?

254
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:22,013
[USOPP]
My "Usopp Ahh-ahh-ahh"? Oh sure!

255
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,890
I'll let you use it
while I wait down here!

256
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:25,642
[SANJI]
Just hurry up, ya coward!

257
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:28,103
[USOPP cries] No, wait!
You don't need me!

258
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,729
The air's too thin up there!

259
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:33,775
[SANJI] I'm coming for you,
Nami, my beautiful swan!

260
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,867
Now that the Ark
Maxim is activated,

261
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,288
nothing can save this nation
from its inevitable destruction.

262
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:50,208
Sky island is destined to fall.

263
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,545
While my destiny as
the Almighty God

264
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,006
shall be to ascend to
the Land Without End.

265
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,634
My rightful utopia,
the Endless Vearth.

266
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,304
All is as it was meant to be.

267
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,348
[snickers]

268
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:09,644
That's right. I mustn't forget.
There's a certain treasure

269
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,689
I need to make sure and
claim along the way.

270
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,608
I guess the huge golden bell
and belfry that were the pride

271
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,361
of Shandora must have only
been another legend.

272
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,573
It's a shame I'll never be
able to lay my eyes on them.

273
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,783
A Golden Bell.

274
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:28,788
[ENERU] None are more deserving
of such a prize than I,

275
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:32,250
the man who rules
the very heavens!

276
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,962
What's wrong? You're lucky
to have made it this far.

277
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:38,423
Abandon all thoughts of your
incompetent playmates

278
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:42,594
and embrace the glorious
future I've given you.

279
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:46,181
Yeah, thanks.
You're a swell guy.

280
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:50,435
But one thing's more
precious than gold.

281
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:53,229
It's a treasure
called friendship.

282
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,565
[drums beating]

283
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:58,818
[USOPP laughs]
We're gonna to get some gold!

284
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:00,987
[LUFFY howls]

285
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:02,072
I treasure!

286
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:04,074
Tomorrow!

287
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,075
[ROBIN chuckles]

288

[ALL cheer]

289
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:11,081
What good is owning
the world's wealth

290
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:13,792
without friends to share it?

291
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,585
This island is
filled with riches

292
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,339
I'd love to get my hands on.
But sacrificing my friends

293
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:22,676
and enduring your ego
is too steep a price to pay.

294
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,511
So, your treasure?

295
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,475
It's yours. I don't want it!

296
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,812
[ENERU]
Really? You don't want anything?

297
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:36,606
[NAMI grunts]

298
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:43,363
Not even... your life?

299
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,702
[CONIS] Calm down, Suu.
Tell me what happened?

300
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:52,455
[SUU gibbers]

301
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,417
But, wait! Neither Sanji
nor Usopp are in any shape

302
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,169
to be moving around!
Why aren't they here?

303
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,296
[SUU grumbles]

304
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,757
Where did they go?

305
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,676
Come on, tell me!

306
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:08,054
[SUU gibbers]

307
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:12,350
[CONIS] Sanji woke up and
then he woke up Usopp.

308
00:19:12,434 --> 00:19:17,522
And they both ran and jumped up?

309
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,650
To the... the ship? You're sure?

310
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,278
[SUU gibbers]

311
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,530
[CONIS]
But they're not fully healed!

312
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:29,492
Oh, look at this place.
It's a mess.

313
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,127
[USOPP gasps]
You sure about this?

314
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,005
The wind's really strong!
Maybe we should wait!

315
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:43,923

a severe case of

Incurable!

317
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,261
Take the rope, Sanji!
You don't need me!

318
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,972
Stop rambling and focus!

320
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,940
Go now! Launch it!

This is on your head!

322
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,990
[SANJI]
Here goes nothin'!

323
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,502
[ENERU] Really, that was not
a wise thing for you to say.

324
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,089
You have chosen foolish ideals
over your own survival.

325
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,051
[ENERU] If you do not wish
to be aboard this ship,

there is but one
path left for you.

00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,555
Heh.

328
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,308

331
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,246
I can't do this!

00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:57,205
[SANJI]
Shut up!

333
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,707
Yes sir!

334
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,543
Usopp! Stop swinging!

God of the White Sea or not,
if he lays a finger on Nami,

339
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,825
I'll be his personal
Blue Sea nightmare!

but I won't give in.

Even if it takes all
my brains and energy.

343
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:55,138
I will survive this! I have to.

344
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:59,225
I will live to sail the seas
with my friends once again!

345

[NAMI] Luffy. I need to borrow
some of your courage!

348
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

349
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

350
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

351
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

352
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

353
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

354
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

355
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

356
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

357
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

358
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

359
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:45,498
[SANJI] Eneru, you'll pay
for kidnapping Nami!

360
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,208
[NAMI] If I stay here,
he'll kill me!

361
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,585
I have to escape!

362
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:51,171
[ENERU] It's far too late
for you to be saved now.

363
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:52,547
[USOPP]
How do we stop a god?

364
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,506
[ENERU]
You are doomed!

365
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,758
[SANJI]
Hold on, Nami!

366
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:57,469
I'll save you even if it
costs me Usopp's life!

367
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:58,470
[USOPP]
Gee, thanks.

368
00:23:58,553 --> 00:24:00,263
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

369
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,598
"The Two Awaken!

370
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:04,559
On the Front Lines of the
Burning Love Rescue!"

371
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:07,187
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
