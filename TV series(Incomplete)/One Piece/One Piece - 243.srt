should go guard the bedroom?

Nah. I'm sure the

37
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,567

as too much security.

But for a long time
I've wanted to see you.

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,202
I even put your wanted
poster up in my room,

00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,670
so I'd never forget.

00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,283
You wanted to kill me?

124
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:14,288
That's right. Before
you destroy the world.

125
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,257
Tell me... Why are you
looking for the Poneglyphs?

126
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,793
You must know the risk.

127
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,428
For as long as
anyone can remember,

128
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,064
the World Government has
made it a serious crime

129
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,066
to research them.

130
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:29,069
Why is that knowledge
so important?

131
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:32,439
If they're so bad, then why
do you know about them?

132
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:36,143
Knowing that the Poneglyphs
exist is hardly a crime.

133
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,778
But deciphering
them is another matter

134
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:42,783
and you're the only person in
the world who's capable of that.

135
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,184
That's why the World Government

136
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,686
put such a large
bounty on your head.

137
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,757
Even though you were only
8 years old at the time.

138
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,059
They fear what
you're capable of.

139
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,561
Because you
alone have the power

140
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,230
to revive the ancient weapons.

141
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:02,669
So, you already know.

142
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,174
Yes, but I never
would've thought

143
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,743
that CP9 was actually real.

144
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,412
And if that's the
case, that means

145
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,147
you've already
left the Straw Hats

146
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,716
and you're helping the
World Government now.

147
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,284
A strange choice for a woman

148
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,220
whose been on their most
wanted list for 20 years,

149
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:24,091
but, mwell, I suppose
that's not my concern.

150
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,158
If you decipher the Poneglyphs

151
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,595
and rebuild one of the
weapons it doesn't matter

152
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,397
if the person who uses
it's "good" or "evil."

153
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,666
It's all the same in the end.

154
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,037
A weapon can never be used
to bring peace to this world.

155
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,242
All it can bring is destruction.

156
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:45,545
We've buried the evils of
the past, now let them lie.

157
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,818
You may be right
and I don't disagree.

158
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,454
But you don't know
why I'm doing this.

159
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,190
You have no right to tell
me what I'm allowed to do

160
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:57,758
or not do with my research

161
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,427
or what knowledge
I can or cannot learn.

162
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,467
Mwell, I see what you mean.

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,771
But the truth is we might have
more in common than you think.

164
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,040
Perhaps you didn't know.

165
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,208
But I possess the blueprints

166
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,743
for the ancient
weapon known as Pluton.

167
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,380
[ROBIN]
Then they still exist?

168
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,448
[ICEBERG] Pluton is the
name of a battleship built

169
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,451
on this island many
years in the past.

170
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,554
The shipwrights who
created the weapon

171
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,791
passed on the blueprints as
a sort of insurance policy.

172
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,294
They feared that another
battleship of equal power

173
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:36,630
would be necessary if Pluton
ever fell into the wrong hands.

174
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,132
Thankfully, the ship was lost

175
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,768
to history before
that could happen.

176
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,038
And now the government
wants to revive that power,

177
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,574
when there's no force
strong enough to oppose it.

178
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,610
A part of me hopes that
you didn't know that

179
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,612
when you agreed
to help them out

180
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,647
but that doesn't
really matter now.

181
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,084
A man named Tom entrusted
those blueprints to me.

182
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,752
And he also told me
about a young girl

183
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:03,324
who was the sole survivor of
the Ohara incident 20 years ago.

184
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,726
He said despite her age,
she was still dangerous,

185
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,595
because she had
the same ideology

186
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,330
as the devils from Ohara.

187
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,432
In honor of Tom and
the other shipwrights,

188
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,368
it's my responsibility
to stop you!

189
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,803
Of course, now that
the government knows

190
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,073
that the blueprints exist the
logical solution would be

191
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,208
to burn them and
be done with this mess.

192
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,811
But I can't do that because
as long as you're alive,

193
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:26,646
there's a chance that the
weapon could be rebuilt!

194
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,564
[ROBIN] Is that all you
want to say before you die?

195
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,566
Oh, and with all due respect,

196
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,736
even if you had killed me,
nothing would've changed.

197
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,705
The government doesn't need me
to steal the blueprints from you

198
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,374
and I'm sure they've already
accomplished that anyway.

199
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,051
Mwell, let's not get
ahead of ourselves here.

200
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,257
You're the ones
who've fallen for my trap.

201
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,447
Aaahhh...

202
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:38,819
Oh!

203
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,620
That's it!

204
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,630
I thought I'd never
get out of there!

205
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,398
Man, that was terrible!

206
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,734
Okay. Let's get
it right this time!

207
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,603
I'll find Robin for sure!

208
00:13:55,636 --> 00:14:03,410
Gum-Gum Rocket!

209
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,697
[BULL MASK] I'm afraid you're
no match for our martial arts.

210
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:29,270
[BULL MASK] Now stop resisting
and hand us the document

211
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,205

it with your blood.

Damn it...

213
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:40,380
I really thought
I could beat them...

214
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,325
[PAULIE]
I shoulda known better.

215
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,327
This was all my idea.

216
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,096
Iceberg didn't
tell me to fight.

217
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,134
He told me to get
the hell out of here.

218
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,703
To run and leave
the blueprints behind.

219
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,276
[PAULIE]
Ya know why?

220
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,645
'Cause those are
nothing but fakes.

221
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,713
[SKULL MASK]
Wha...?

222
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,814
[BULL MASK]
What?

223
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,516
[SKULL MASK]
He can't be serious.

224
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,252
[BULL MASK]
What a waste of time.

225
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,653
[PAULIE]
I don't know who you are,

226
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,790
but this means your
plan's a bust, huh?

227
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:26,694
Too bad. Sucks to be you.

228
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,229
Funny thing is
I don't even know

229
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,733
what you bastards were
looking for in the first place.

230
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,303
If you think you've
outwitted CP9, you're wrong.

231
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,572
You're merely
delaying the inevitable.

232
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:42,610
[BULL MASK] At any rate, even
though you're only a decoy.

233
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:46,479
Now that you know the truth,

Damn it! I got stuck again!

236
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,098
Stupid walls getting
in my way all the time!

237
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,666
I hate 'em, I hate 'em!

238
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,435
What? Straw Hat.

239
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,404
Hey, it's the rope guy!

240
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,406
What's going on in here?

241
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:15,442
Whoa, are you okay?
You're covered in blood!

242
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,244
You sure did surprise me!

243
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,079
[PAULIE]
Look who's talking!

244
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,448
At least I'm not
crashing through walls.

245
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,284
[BULL MASK]
Straw Hat Luffy.

246
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,453
How kind of you to come here
to take blame for the crime.

247
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,291
Oh! I get it! You guys in
the masks must be the ones

248
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,160
that're forcing Robin to
do all this bad stuff, huh?!

249
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,729
You give her back, you bastards!

250
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,199
If I wasn't stuck right now,
you'd be in big trouble!

[SKULL MASK]
Tempest Kick.

00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:41,768
Uhn?

00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,419
He cut right through the wall!

Hey, behind you!

255
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,699
What are these...?

256
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,670
[BULL MASK]
This is an emergency situation.

257
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,472
We don't have time
to deal with you.

258
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,573
I can't move!

259
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,375
[BULL MASK]
Restrain Paulie too.

260
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,377
He's given us enough
trouble already.

261
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,511
[SKULL MASK]
Right.

Click.

265
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,796
[BULL MASK] It's me.
We've hit a snag in the plan.

266
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,799
Everyone head to the
bedroom immediately.

267
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,235
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

268
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:52,239
You understand?
I absolutely need him alive.

269
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,244
[MASKED WOMAN]
This has been a delight,

270
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,113
but I'm afraid our time is up.

271
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,381
Hmm?

272
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,316
[MASKED WOMAN] You see, I have
a pressing matter to attend to.

273
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,118
Running away, are you?

274
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,252
[MASKED WOMAN]
Not at all.

275
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,560
[MASKED WOMAN] I'm just
finishing you quickly,

276
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,794

You kidding? This is nothing.

00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,280
[PAULIE]
That's good, I guess.

283
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,649
But why did you come
here in the first place?

284
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,286
Everyone still thinks you're
the ones who attacked Iceberg.

285
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,422
Sorry about that, by the way.

286
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,591
I realize I mighta
jumped the gun a little.

287
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:47,061
[LUFFY] No big deal.
We are pirates, after all.

288
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:48,495
Anyway, the point
is those weird guys

289
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,632
in the masks took
one of our crew.

290
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,567
So we're here to get her back.

00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,372
Nico Robin.

292
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,113
So, you're good at
fighting, aren't you?

293
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,748
Hell yeah!

294
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,717
Then you can beat
those guys, huh?

295
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,820
You bet.

296
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,021
Good.

297
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:16,624
We can do this thing together.
'Cause I'm ready to fight!

00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,324
Oh yeah?

00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,525
Of course I am!

I'm just gonna let

then kill Iceberg?!

Who do those punks,
think they are, anyway?!

00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,203
To hell with all this
secret agent crap!

306
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,407
Iceberg is...

307
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,645
...more than just my boss.

308
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,180
He's my teacher.
He made me a shipwright.

309
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,049
I can't let him die.

310
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:43,517
But look at you, you're a mess.

311
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,619
I told you, I'm ready
to fight those bastards,

312
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,887
and I'm not giving up!

313
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,091
I don't care what happens to me
as long as I can save Iceberg!

to give you people!

This is your own fault.

00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,065
You should've handed
over the blueprints

when the government
asked nicely.

330
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,740

we could walk away

That means you've been with

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,258
Indeed.

00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,292
Needless to say,

338
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:36,263
going undercover was
like second-nature to us.

339
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:39,066
Now since everyone's
being so honest

340
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,670
with each other,
let's try this again.

341

I don't have time to play games.

342
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:50,611
Tell me before someone
else gets hurt. Where is it?
