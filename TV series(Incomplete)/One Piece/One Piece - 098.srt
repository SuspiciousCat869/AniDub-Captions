00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,698
I got great news!

175
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,666
You want food 'n water?

176
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,135
Because I've brought you
guys plenty of both!

177
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:49,802
[LUFFY laughs]

178
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,572
Oh! That's much appreciated!

179
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,141
This should be more than enough
to last us a good while.

180
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,076
Ace is one incredible man.

181
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,211
Sure is.

182
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,080
Kind and thoughtful to a fault,
unlike someone we know!

183
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,315
That's true.

184
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,383
[CHOPPER]
Thank you. I was so thirsty.

185
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,551
[ACE]
Then drink up!

186
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,053
[LUFFY]
Me too!

187
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,022
[VIVI]
Um, excuse me, Ace?

188
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,692
I assume you used something
other than money to get this.

189
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,659
Whatever you did,

190
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,561
please don't tell me you
stole the supplies.

191
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,829
That's not my style.

192
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,098
Actually, the rebel
army gave it to me.

193
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:19,765
[gasps]

194
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,367
[VIVI]
The rebel army?

195
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,369
[ACE] Well, perhaps
"fake rebel soldiers"

196
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,205
would be a more
precise description.

197
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,541
[NAMI]
Fake? What do you mean by that?

198
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,244
I mean, they passed
themselves off as rebel soldiers

199
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,179
in order to get hired
by the village.

200
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,515
And the villagers were so
grateful for their protection

201
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,519
that they've accepted these
hoodlums with open arms.

202
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,387
[NAMI] I get that they're
desperate for help,

203
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,755
but wouldn't they
eventually figure out

204
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,190
they've been duped?

205
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
Not necessarily.

206
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,460
The villagers know the mere
mention of the rebel army

207
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,529
is enough to send
most bandits running.

208
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,364
It's ingenious, really.

209
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,733
A confident swagger with
a little misdirection

210
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,537
and the money and
prestige comes rolling in.

211
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,205
Well, rebel soldiers
aren't hoodlums,

212
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,473
nor is their title
meant to serve

213
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,742
as some sort of decoration.

214
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,745
Vivi.

215
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,648
I'm sure we'd all be happy to
teach these guys a lesson.

216
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,448
Yeah?

217
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,783
Well, if your plan
for restitution

218
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,385
involves duping the villagers,

219
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,587
may I point out that's exactly
how they were treated

220
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,721
by the hoodlums.

221
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,889
At least the way
things stand now,

222
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,892
the villagers live in peace
with their fake protectors.

223
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,794
Is this necessary?

224
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,462
[SANJI]
I understand what you're saying,

225
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,399
but you gotta consider this
from Vivi's perspective.

226
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,734
Surely you'd like to
see those jerks pay.

227
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,336
[ACE] Look, Vivi can
do what she wants.

228
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,406
I was only sharing my
thoughts on the subject.

229
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,511
I don't wanna hear your excuses!

230
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,280
For years I waited for you all
alone in an abandoned city

231
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,649
in the middle of
a trackless desert!

232
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,319
[SANJI] There's no reason
you should stick up

233
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,920
for those bastards.

234
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,589
[ACE]
I'm not sticking up for 'em.

235
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,925
I just know you guys are in a
hurry to get going, that's all.

236
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,926
[VIVI]
Fine.

237
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,862
My kingdom's no longer
able to protect everyone,

238
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,265
so I find nothing wrong
with villages attempting

239
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,768
to uphold public safety on
their own whenever possible.

240
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,437
Done.

241
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,840
No. First I mean to put
these bandits to the test.

242
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,208
A test?

243
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,176
Yes.

244
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,311
And if these impostors
are protecting them,

245
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,213
even if that protection
is nothing more

246
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,781
than a byproduct of their ruse,

247
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,619
then I really don't care what
they pass themselves off as.

248
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,886
You want us to find out

249
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,189
if these hoodlums
have hearts of gold.

250
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,156
Yes.

251
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,525
I'm sorry, but this is
something that requires

252
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,329
everyone's cooperation
if we're to pull it off.

253
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,164
That's no problem, Vivi!

254
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,332
[chuckles]

255
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,369
[LUFFY] All right! Now things
are getting interesting!

256
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,903
[CHOPPER] What do you
mean by "interesting"?

257
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,839
[NAMI] Hold on, Luffy!
You need to calm down.

258
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,807
This isn't a game, understand?

259
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,009
[LUFFY]
Yeah, yeah, I get it!

260
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,578
Basically, we're gonna track
down these fake rebel guys,

261
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,480
then beat 'em up, right?

262
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,848
[SANJI]
He doesn't understand a thing.

263
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,549
Someone needs to put
him on a short leash.

264
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,521
[CAMU]
He's been gone too long.

265
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,723
First he says, "Leave it to
me," and then he takes off.

266
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,358
That was over an hour ago!

267
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,559
[IMPOSTOR A]
You saw his strength!

268
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,095
I'll bet he's beating those
sand pirates up as we speak!

269
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,063
[IMPOSTOR B]
Don't be so sure.

270
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,431
Remember who he's fighting!

271
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,666
They might've gotten
the jump on him!

272
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,101
[IMPOSTOR C] If that's true,
that means we're next, huh?

273
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,770
[growls]

274
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,104
[CAMU]
I can't do this!

275
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm sure gonna miss these
perfect accommodations!

276
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,443
But staying alive
is all that matters!

277
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,378
That's for sure.

278
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,014
[BOTH yelp]

279
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,696
[VILLAGERS cheering]

280
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,805
[MAYOR] Gentlemen!
We're all relying on you!

281
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,773
I was just about to
come calling for you,

282
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,543
but I should've realized you
are on top of the situation.

283
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,612
Of course you were already aware
that the sea pirates are here!

284
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,381
[ALL]
Sea pirates?

285
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,650
Not sand pirates?

286
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,485
Yes. Sea pirates.

287
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,121
Far more ferocious and
deadly than sand pirates.

288
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,957
One in particular is classified
as a priority‐capture,

289
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,461
and has a 30‐million‐Berry
bounty on his head!

290
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,062
Once we heard you'd give a...

291
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,330
[MAYOR, VILLAGERS]
..."hiyah!"

292
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,132
...to these gruesome pirates and
stop them cold in their tracks,

293
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,067
we knew we could rest easy.

294
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,103
We know you won't fail!

295
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,504
[KID A]
Good luck, mister!

296
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,005
[CAMU]
Huh?

297
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,508
Show those stupid sea
pirates who's boss!

298
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,844
I'm gonna get strong
just like you someday!

299
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,113
[KIDS laughing]

300
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,514
[CAMU]
Let's go!

301
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:33,119
[VILLAGERS cheering]

302
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,021
Hey, Big Bro, are you
serious about this?

303
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,191
Don't be stupid. Of course he's
not serious. That's crazy.

304
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,993
Shut up, both of you.

305
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,027
Once outta town,

306
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,863
we run in the opposite
direction of those pirates

307
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,631
and we don't stop.

308
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,500
That's our only chance
to get outta this alive.

309
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,002
We keep running.

310
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,837
We understand.

311
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,478
[chuckles]

312
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,489
[CAMU] Look at them all,
following our every step.

313
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,959
Morons! What a bunch
of mindless sheep.

314
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,035
Stay sharp. We've got
one shot at this.

315
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,869
Once outside the gates,

316
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,638
we find which direction
is pirate‐free

317
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,640
and then we take off
as fast as we can.

318
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,707
Got it?

319
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,709
[IMPOSTOR B] Uh‐huh.
Understood, loud and clear.

320
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,644
[CAMU]
Here goes!

321
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,180
One! Two! Three!

00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,228
[CAMU]
Oh, crap!

326
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,198
Get 'em, get 'em,
invincible rebel army!

327
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,034
[CAMU]
He's gonna get us killed!

328
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,119
[LUFFY] What's that?
You're a rebel soldier?

329
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,221
[gasps]

330
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,890
[CAMU]
No, nothing of the sort!

331
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,191
We're just simple travelers
passing through!

332
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,793
Now say your prayers!

333
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,795
You dastardly sea
pirates are dead!

334
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,231
These brave rebel soldiers
are gonna make mincemeat

335
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,632
out of the whole lot of you.

336
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,967
You cowardly thieves!

337
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,869
Stop talking!
You're not helping!

338
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,237
[MAYOR]
Right! Right! How rude of me!

339
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,105
It won't happen again!
Please, carry on!

340
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,274
I'm not even here!

341
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,711
Loser. The guy's as
spineless as a jellyfish.

342
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,946
Completely unreliable.

343
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,248
Yeah.

344
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,983
[NAMI] Are you sure about
letting this play out?

345
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,987
It might be better for everyone
if we take care of them now.

346
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,722
