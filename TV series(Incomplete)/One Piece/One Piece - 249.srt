1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,712
Have a nice flight!

2
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,184
Damn you!

3
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,282
Now that hurt.

4
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:55,556
If that leopard freak
wanted to piss me off,

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,690
he sure as hell did.

6
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,760
All right, now time
for some payback.

7
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,110
Damn it! Not again!

8
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,228
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

9
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,638
Interesting.

10
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,508
Many ships were born
in this cobwebbed room

11
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,077
and now look at it. Filthy.

12
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,148
They built ships here?

13
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,591
Tom, Iceberg, and Cutty Flam.

14
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,594
This place must hold
countless memories of days

15
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,795
when you still shared
a life with those two.

16
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,567
And now you call it
"your top secret base."

17
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,237
That's heartbreakingly adorable.

18
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,507
Damn you. Just get
the hell out already!

19
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,611
We won't leave till
we get what we're after.

20
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,512
Make this easy on yourself.

21
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,515
There ain't no
blueprints in here!

22
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,785
Oh? No? You don't say?

23
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,154
Hey!

24
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,188
Kalifa!

25
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,100
Dammit!

26
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,668
Just keep it together Usopp.

27
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,074
You bastard.

28
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,242
Take your time,

29
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,212
but be aware that we know
many things about your past.

30
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,080
Things that you
don't want getting out.

31
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,816
For example, we know what
happened eight years ago.

32
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,783
And that you are guilty

33
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:47,087
of committing a very
serious crime back then.

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,689
Just like your dear old Tom.

35
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,659
You shut up! Tom was
never a damn criminal!!

36
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:55,695
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about! You freak!

37
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,206
Tom!

38
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,678
Stay back!

39
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,647
I disagree.
You're both criminals.

40
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,915
And as such,

41
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,185
you should be made to feel the
consequences of your actions.

42
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,521
Franky. Whatever happens,

43
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:23,123
don't interfere with
what I'm about to do.

44
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,292
No matter what.

45
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,494
You talk like you
know everything.

46
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,397
You don't know Tom.

47
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:35,368
And you don't know
anything about Water Seven!

48
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,515
I heard the Judicial Ship
will be here in three days.

49
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,218
Finally putting Tom
on trial, are they?

50
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,786
I hope it ends well for him.

51
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,688
I'm sure it will.

52
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,826
Right. He fulfilled
his promise after all.

53
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,493
That he did.

54
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,166
Alright, let's get
that lumber in the dock!

55
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,636
So, how'd the deal
work out with St. Poplar?

56
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,670
Not that great.

57
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,138
They're taking advantage of us

58
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,641
since we don't have
much to trade with 'em.

59
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,509
Like iron from San Faldo.

60
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,612
We'll all be in the red if
this kinda crap keeps up!

61
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,615
We're not gonna let this keep
happenin', now are we guys?!

62
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,718
Yeah! No way!

63
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,457
The people do seem to be happy

64
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,359
about being able
to cross the ocean.

65
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,297
But they say the trade situation
isn't as good as they'd hoped.

66
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,032
I wonder if this town
needs more than a sea train.

67
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,370
Ah, but their
spirits are up, boy!

68
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,540
That's a major step,
so give the rest some time.

69
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,774
We've done our best,

70
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:52,146
so be proud, keep your head
held high and walk with gusto!

71
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,346
Yeah.

72
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,824
You there!

73
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,992
Am I correct in assuming

74
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,329
I'm speaking with Mr. Tom,
the shipbuilding engineer?!

75
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,463
You're a difficult
man to pin down.

76
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,534
I have some matter of
great importance I wish to--

77
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,635
Uhm Sir?

78
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,370
This man and I are talking!!

79
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,070
Yes, sir!

80
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,406
Again before I was so rudely--

81
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:28,816
I was going to say.
My name is agent Spandam.

82
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:31,285
From Cipher Pol Number Five!

83
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,686
Spandam, sir!

84
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,092
OW! Sorry about that! My bad!

85
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,262
Looks like you got in the way
of my victory cannon salute!

86
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:45,199
Tough luck! It's! Super!

87
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,468
Battle Franky thirty-five
comes back home with booty!

88
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,603
That's right. Check it out!

89
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:54,174
Is this not the biggest Sea King
you ever laid your eyes on?!

90
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,246
I can't believe him.
Still acting like a child.

91
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:05,486
Hey! What hell do ya think
you're doing, Ice-for-brains?!

92
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,121
Will you ever grow up?

93
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,255
Ever since you were a kid

94
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,457
all you wanna do is build
these stupid battleships!

95
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,560
It's time to stop!
This better be the last one!

96
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,363
Or I'm gonna start
tearin' em all apart myself!

97
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,597
Wanna bet?!

98
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,301
You lay a finger on my ship
and you'll draw back a stump!

99
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:20,968
You hear me?!

100
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,270
Yeah? Mwell! Listen, Franky!

101
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,205
If you were able
to kill a Sea King

102
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,440
with this floating
piece of junk

103
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,275
that means it's a
dangerous weapon.

104
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,144
And you've got all
those other "battleships"

105
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,478
of yours just
strewn around here?

106
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,612
What're you thinking?!

107
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,716
Hey, it's not like I'm attacking
people with them, am I?

108
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,451
I'm not saying <i>you'd</i> do that!

109
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,652
But you're making it easier

110
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,655
for anyone else who'd
want to, you idiot!

111
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,490
Sir--

112
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,228
Am I right? Back me up here Tom!

113
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,265
Flunky's weapons are gonna
be the end of our business!

114
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:54,802
Ah! "Flunky" That's rich!

115
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,238
Hold on! This is
no laughing matter!

116
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,440
I demand a sincere apology!

117
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,343
And that you listen to
what I've come here to say!

118
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,380
Government guy are ya?
So, is this about the trial?

119
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,749
Trial? What the devil
are you talking about?

120
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,519
No, this concerns an
altogether different matter.

121
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,589
Now what?

122
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,127
Did Tom come back with you boys?

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,062
No, I think he's with a visitor.

124
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,833
Some man from the government.
It wasn't about the trial.

125
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,202
Span-Span something.

126
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,170
Span-Something, dumb? Maybe?

127
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,240
How strange. And he's not
from the judicial ship?

128
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,176
The government
is so disorganized.

129
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,780
Fraid not.

130
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,582
I've got no blueprints
for something like that.

131
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,652
That's nonsense!

132
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,288
Do you take me for some kind
of weak minded simpleton?!

133
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,491
I researched the history of
Water Seven for countless hours!

134
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,593
And I am absolutely
certain this document

135
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,095
can only be in your possession!

136
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,399
You're saying that
you actually have

137
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,501
the authority to
investigate me?

138
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,637
That's right, I do!
And what's more.

139
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,373
I learned all about your
dealings with Gold Roger

140
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,442
in the course of
my investigation.

141
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,611
So unless you want me
to share that information

142
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,446
with my colleagues,
you're going to cooperate.

143
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,482
Why would I care? The government
already knows about it!

144
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,118
We do? That's utter poppycock!

145
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,386
If that's true,

146
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,190
why are you here and not rotting
away somewhere in a jail cell?

147
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,193
Use your investigative powers
and find out for yourself.

148
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,294
Good day.

149
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,731
Hey! You can't treat a
government agent like this!

150
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,066
Open the door this immediately!

151
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,806
That's right.
It's all true. Yes sir.

152
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,508
He did exactly what he
told the judge he'd do.

153
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,577
And they should be dropping

154
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,746
the charges at the
trial that's coming up.

155
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,582
That man saved
this island, for sure.

156
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:49,850
It makes my blood boil.

157
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:54,622
To think, that damned criminal
is being treated like a hero.

158
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:58,692
I see. You're certain that
such a thing truly exists?

159
00:10:58,725 --> 00:10:59,926
Yes sir!

160
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,063
And the pirates are scouring
the globe for it as we speak.

161
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,766
That's why it's imperative
we locate it immediately.

162
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,035
If it were to fall
into the wrong hands,

163
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,404
the resulting destruction
would be inconceivable.

164
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,040
We've been suffering through
this "great pirate era"

165
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,308
for more than a decade now.

166
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,811
It's a vile sickness that grows
worse with every passing day.

167
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,713
The time for idle
discussion is over.

168
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,516
We must do more than to prevent
this weapon's construction.

169
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,817
We must build it ourselves

170
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,487
and use it as a mighty
instrument of justice!

171
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,689
With it, we can eliminate
this pirate scourge

172
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,592
and bring law and order
back to our land!

173
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,260
Hmm.

174
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,431
This is indeed a troubling era.
There's no doubt about that.

175
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,500
Your primary objective
will be to locate

176
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,101
and then obtain
these blueprints.

177
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,203
That will be all at this time.

178
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,740
We trust that you can complete
this mission, Spandam.

179
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,075
Yes sir! Without fail!

180
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:52,313
I've been working on
this case for far too long

181
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,781
to see it all go up in smoke.

182
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,516
It's right within my grasp now.

183
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,788
Let's go!

184
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,228
Damn! If the judge
decides to acquit him

185
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,698
that'll mean a
real headache for me.

186
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,265
Spandam, sir!

187
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:22,076
The charge will stick
and that bastard will hang.

188
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:26,379
Men! I'll need five
more agents, stat!

189
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,753
Spandam, sir!

190
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,150
Iceberg, Franky.

191
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:03,717
Yeah?

192
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,152
Hey, boys, come here.

193
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,286
What's up?

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,356
It's about time I let you
in on somethin' important!

195
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,064
Why would anyone even
dream of something like this?

196
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,602
Is this for real? Can this
thing actually be built?

197
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,272
Those are the blueprints for
a nightmare, a real monster.

198
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,374
The government has
learned of their existence

199
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,476
and has started
sniffing around for them.

200
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,479
It's too dangerous for
me to keep them anymore.

201
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:36,550
This is terrifying,
but I agree. I'll keep them.

202
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,355
Wow, Iceberg. Hey let's see
if we can build this thing!

203
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,789
You idiot!

204
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,560
Do you ever think
before you speak?!

205
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,095
This thing can never be built.

206
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,364
Do you realize how much
destruction it could cause?

207
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,471
Yeah, the world
would be done for.

208
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,445
Besides tryin' to
build the damn thing,

209
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,513
you can do whatever the
hell you want with it for now.

210
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,315
Even toss it if you need to.

211
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,050
Yes, of course.

212
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,688
While I got your attention.
Here's another storm a brewin'.

213
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,029
Franky! Hold on!

214
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:26,300
For what?

215
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,202
For your pants, you silly boy!

216
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,771
I swear, you'd think after
all that attention you got

217
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,005
last time you went out

218
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,042
dressed like that, you'd be
wise enough to not do it again.

219
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,777
Geez. I'm just goin'
out to get a few things.

220
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,447
Now, that you're dressed,
you can skedaddle!

221
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,684
Thanks. I can't believe
she's makin' a big dinner

222
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,687
just cause the stupid judge is
finally sayin' Tom's not guilty.

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,521
He never was in the first place.

224
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,326
Alright.

225
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:57,131
Rise and shine!
Tom! Iceberg! Get up!

226
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,832
Today's judgment day!

227
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,334
Don't wanna sleep
through your big trial!

228
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,406
Let's get down to the harbor!

229
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,008
They're gonna hand
down Tom's sentence!

230
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,751
The spectators are
boarding the ship in droves.

231
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,787
The people are
really interested.

232
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,689
Seems like it'll be a big trial.

233
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:23,390
Seems that way.

234
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,160
Have you had a chance to see
the sea train yet, your honor?

235
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:31,565
I have indeed. Quite impressive.
A true feat of ingenuity.

236
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,500
He fulfilled his
end of the bargain.

237
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,736
I'm certain the
people will rejoice

238
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,272
to see their hero go free.

239
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,273
Is Tom here yet?

240
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,508
I wish it would start already.

241
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,078
Come on! We gotta hurry
before all the seats are taken!

242
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,146
I know, I can't wait to
see the look on his face

243
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,347
when the judge lets him off!

244
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,385
What a trip! Wow, can't believe
it's been fourteen years.

245
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,433
The ship's under attack!

246
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,608
Get away from it!

247
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,143
Run! Hurry!

248
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,045
What the?!
Is this a pirate raid?!

249
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,585
But how? Where is this
attack even coming from?

250
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:27,020
Hey, look over there!

251
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,623
What? Some kind of fleet!

252
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,564
Those look like battleships!

253
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,532
Those pirates are attacking us!

254
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,504
There's so many of them!
Are they all working together?

255
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,343
Everybody! Run!

256
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,544
Get outta the harbor!

257
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,512
Hurry!

258
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,547
It's not safe near the water!

259
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,316
My baby! Where's my baby?!

260
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,694
What's happening?

261
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:15,769
Who the hell? Who's doing this?!
Who took my ships?

262
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,604
Tom! We're in trouble!

263
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:21,375
Franky's ships are
attacking the harbor!

264
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,678
It's not him. I saw him earlier.
He wouldn't do such a thing!

265
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,815
I know that! Look, I'm positive
it's not Franky doing it.

266
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,684
This is a whole other
kind of trouble we're in!

267
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,786
Let's put a stop to it!

268
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,555
Right!

269
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,657
Pirates? Or worse,
the Government.

270
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,295
Evacuate!

271
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:44,030
Hurry! Into the city!

272
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,767
Get away from the harbor!

273
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,501
My father's still inside!

274
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,040
Bastards! They're gonna pay!!

275
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,179
Who the hell is it, huh?!

276
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,382
Who the hell is screwing
around with my ships?!

277
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,825
Please, come with us your honor!
The ship can't take much more!

278
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:14,060
Who does that fleet belong to?

279
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,566
The raid on the Judicial Ship
was a success sir.

280
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,537
Excellent. Now, I want you to
proceed to step two immediately.

281
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,806
We must ensure that
justice is served.

282
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,274
Yes, sir!

283
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:36,349
Now, let's begin your impending
trial in earnest. Shall we, Tom?

284
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,625
It looks like it's
about to go down.

285
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,494
Alright! Let's get back
to Scrap Heap Island.

286
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,662
Right!

287
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,102
Hey. The fleet is
starting to turn around!

288
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,303
Hold on.

289
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,406
I'm pretty sure I've seen
those ships somewhere before!

290
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,078
Tom, look!
They're heading this way!

291
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,081
They're getting closer!
I think that we can catch 'em!

292
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:09,183
I can't imagine what the
hell they were thinkin'

293
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:13,520
pullin' a stunt like that!

294
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,123
I see two men
approaching from the island!

295
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:20,327
That's Tom. Right!
Let's abandon this ship!

296
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,804
What the?!
Not a soul on this thing!

297
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,208
Same here! I don't see anybody!

298
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:38,579
What the hell is going on here?

299
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,147
More of Franky's ships?

300
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,315
Iceberg! Watch out!

301
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,667
Dammit! My Battle Frankies!
They're destroyed!

302
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:13,747
Tom! Iceberg! Hey!
Can you hear me?!

303
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,217
Are you okay?! What in
the hell happened here?!

304
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:26,092
Tell me what's
going on. Hey! Ice--

305
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,664
You stupid ass!

306
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:40,074
It's your fault this happened.
It was that intelligence agent.

307
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:44,511
He used your damn battleships
to attack people at the harbor.

308
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:48,382
No I-I didn't hurt anybody.

309
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:53,520
I told you this would happen.
But you don't listen.

310
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,454
Listen, Franky!

311
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,390
If you killed a Sea
King with this ship,

312
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,492
then it's a dangerous weapon.

313
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,660
You're making it
easier for somebody

314
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,329
who wants to use it
like one, you idiot!

315
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:06,734
My ships did this.
They hurt Tom!

316
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:12,373
Look. We have the ability to
create powerful things, weapons.

317
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:15,542
Even if you weren't trying to.

318
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,746
Weapons are made to hurt people.

319
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:23,484
Whether you want them to or not,
they can hurt your friends.

320
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:25,519
That's what the
government did to us.

321
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,422
They used your creations
to hurt a lot of people.

322
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,291
People we care about!

323
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:32,826
And now they're gonna
put the blame on us.

324
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,762
They want to back
Tom into a corner

325
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,364
so they can get
those blueprints.

326
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,732
After all this.

327
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:43,470
You still think your hands
don't have blood on them?!

328
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:48,042
If Tom gets taken away.
If he hangs for this.

329
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:53,179
I swear on my life.
I will never forgive you!

330
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:16,230
Tom! Forgive me,
this is all my fault!

331
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,832
Silence! Criminals are
not allowed to speak!

332
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,235
That's a load of crap!
We didn't do it!

333
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,503
Be quiet, you hooligan!

334
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,705
My business is solely
with the Fish-man!

335
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,906
What're you gonna do to him?!

336
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:29,410
When I'm done, Tom's workers
will be a thing of the past!

337
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,678
On the next episode One Piece:

338
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:35,048
"The End of the Legendary Man!
The Day the Sea Train Cried."

339
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,684
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
