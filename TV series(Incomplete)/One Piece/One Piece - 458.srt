[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,661
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,997
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,833
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:49,536
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,205
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,174
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,044
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,679
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,180
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:03,550
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,153
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,323
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,527
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:18,231
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,380
[PRISONERS chattering]

17
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,550
[PRISONER A] I'm so full,
I think I'm gonna pop!

18
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,518
[PRISONER B] I think I
just gained ten pounds!

19
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,988
[PRISONER C] Navy food
sure beats bread and water!

20
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,989
[PRISONER D]
Bread?

21
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:44,624
Ha! We were lucky to
eat dirt back there!

22
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,994
[PRISONER E]
Good thing our hero came!

23
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,563
[PRISONERS] We're forever
in your debt, Captain Buggy!

24
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:50,797
Thank you!

25
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,167
[BUGGY laughing]

26
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,703
No problem, lads,
you're all very welcome!

27
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,006
So, how much longer before
we get there, Jimbei?

28
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,807
[JIMBEI]
What?

29
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,508
[BUGGY]
Hpmh.

30
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,444
Don't "what" me, you turd!

31
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,812
When are we gonna
arrive at Navy HQ?

32
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,683
I'm ready to throw down and show
those damn dirtbags who's boss!

33
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,952
What an inspirational attitude.

34
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,021
I know, I can't stop shaking.

35
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:15,956
The Seven Warlords
who sold their souls

36
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,291
to the World Government
and those three Admirals

37
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,495
they're no match for the
likes of us, are they, men?

38
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,762
[PRISONER F]
That's right!

39
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,131
[PRISONER G] You should be
the next King of the Pirates,

40
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,265
Captain Buggy!

41
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,901
'Cause you're doing just
what Gold Roger would do!

42
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,807
[LUFFY] "A Special Retrospective
Before Marineford!

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,676

Come Together!"

44

[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, at Navy
Headquarters in Marineford...

45
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,519
[MARINE A]
May we enter?

46
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,191
Pardon us. But it's time.

47
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,493
We're going to need
you to follow us

48
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,828
down to the harbor right away.

49
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,797
[NARRATOR] Without "First
Son of the Sea" Jimbei,

50
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,333
who is with Luffy,
and Marshall D. Teach,

51
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,468
who has burst into Impel Down,

52
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:05,973
five of the Seven Warlords
are about to leave Marie Jois.

53
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,475
Among them is the
infamous Boa Hancock,

54
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,679
waiting in silence after
her stop at Impel Down.

55
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,948
Four of these five individuals
have had dealings

56
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,118
with the Straw Hat
Pirates in the past.

57
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,453
Whitebeard's nothing
but a tired old geezer

58
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,057
and look at the lot of you,
beside yourselves with fear!

59
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,192
What's the big rush?

60
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:28,462
We still have three hours
before the execution.

61
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,830
That's true, but I'm afraid

62
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,532
we have to be prepared
for any contingency, sir.

[NARRATOR]
Bartholomew Kuma.

64
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,010
Now suffer the Ursa Shock.

65
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:05,165
I see you survived, Roronoa.

66
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,069
If you were to take a vacation,
here would you want to go?

67
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,541
I'll protect you. Even,
if it costs me my life!

68
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:20,080
[SANJI]
Damn you!

69
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,887
Someone. Help me!

we'll never meet again.

[growling]

75
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,415
Farewell, Straw Hat.

76
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,260
Can't wait to get
your hands dirty, huh?

77
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,001
[DOFLAMINGO]
Creepy, as usual, I see.

78
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:18,305
[NARRATOR] Dracule Mihawk,
aka "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk.

79
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,468
[ZORO]
That's...

80
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,472
That's him.

81
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,708
That man is...

82
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,910
...Hawk-Eye Mihawk.

83
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,884
I set sail for only
one reason, to meet you.

84
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,352
And what is your goal?

85
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,820
To beat you.

86
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,821
[MIHAWK]
Heh.

87
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,322
How foolish.

88
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,561
Tiger!

89
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,694
Trap!

90
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,335
Sir, state your name.

91
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,110
I am Roronoa Zoro.

92
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:30,411
[MIHAWK]
I'll remember it.

93
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,980
No one as strong as you has
come around in quite some time.

94
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,150
So as a swordsman's courtesy,

95
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,154
I'll use the world's strongest
black sword to finish you.

96
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,023
[ZORO] Three Sword
Style Secret Technique!

97
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,359

[ZORO]
Three Thousand Worlds!

99
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,910
But why?

100
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,815
Scars on the back are
a swordsman's shame.

101
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,182
Fine.

102
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:18,358
Zoro!

103
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,497
[MIHAWK] You shouldn't rush
these things, young man.

104
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,635
There's nothing to be upset
about. Your friend will live.

105
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,437
It's still far too
early for you to die.

106
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:33,507
My name is Hawkeye Mihawk!

107
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,877
You're strong but there
is much for you to learn.

108
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,880
No matter how many years it
takes, I will hold this title

109
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,549
as the greatest in the
world and wait for you.

110
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,486
Until that day, you
must hone your skills.

111
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,522
Then, seek me out, Roronoa Zoro!

112
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,962
[MORIA]
All right, I'm coming!

113
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,731
Don't suppose I'd
want to miss this.

114
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,166
Might be a good chance to steal

115
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,135
some more powerful shadows
and corpses, after all.

116
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,671
If any of Ace's little
buddies try anything,

117
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,274
it'll be an all-you-can-eat
buffet for me!

[MORIA] Now, every last
shadow in Thriller Bark,

00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,057
come to me, and become my power!

[MORIA]
Now, Brick Bat!

128
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,463
I call that one the Black Box!

129
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,397
Dammit, he trapped me!

130
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,467
[MORIA]
I'll crush you!

[MORIA]
Consider this your punishment!

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,759
Sorry, but...

134
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,027
...Mister Doflamingo and Miss
Hancock, you must hurry.

135
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,662
Or what, little man?

136
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,799
Who are you to give me orders?

137
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,600
[NARRATOR]
Boa Hancock.

143
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,132
Actually, you make me sick.

[HANCOCK gasps]

145
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,968
[MARIGOLD]
Stay strong, sister!

146
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,271
This simply cannot be happening.

147
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,473
There's no man alive
that can resist my allure.

148
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,508
It's just not possible!

149
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,981
So long as that man
exists in this world,

150
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,016
I shall never know peace again.

151
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,388

Now, Gum-Gum...

...Jet Gatling!

157
00:12:58,712 --> 00:12:59,813
Hot!

00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,114
[HANCOCK]
He can't be.

159
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,249
You'd rather die

160
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,151
then let people see this
thing on your back, right?

161
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,155
Like I said, don't move.

No more. I'm begging you!

169
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,191
Why are you making me do this?

170
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,659
You've really let me down.

171
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:49,196
And I've got zero tolerance
for useless punks like you.

No! Not again!

Just give me one more
chance to set things right.

177
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:14,555
I swear, we'll loyally
follow your every command.

178
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,689
[sighs]

179
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:20,160
What a touching sentiment.
Such genuine loyalty.

180
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,830
But... I still have
no use for you.

181
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,669
[BELLAMY]
Doflamingo!

182
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,506
[laughing]

183
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,309
The beginning is upon us!
I suggest you prepare.

184
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,178
We're drawing close
to a new world

185
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,014
in which only true
pirates can survive.

186
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,949
The weak should run
while they still can,

187
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,452
or be swept away by
the tides of time,

188
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:48,822
as they roll back to reveal
a new era of champions.

189
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:54,194
[laughing]

190
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,697
[NARRATOR] The extent of
his strength is yet unknown.

191
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,651
[NARRATOR] There is
another figure of interest

192
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,354
at Navy Headquarters.

193
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:24,224
One who's under the command
of Fleet Admiral Sengoku.

194
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,694
[MARINE B]
Sorry to wake you,

195
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,230
but we really need to
get moving, Admiral.

196
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,000
[AOKIJI]
I'm up.

197
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,470
It's already time
for lunch, is it?

198
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,471
[NARRATOR]
Admiral Aokiji.

199
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,411
[AOKIJI]
Ice Age.

200
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:03,463
[LUFFY]
The sea... It's frozen.

201
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:07,500
This is the power of a
Navy Headquarters Admiral.

202
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,703
You have some
very loyal friends.

203
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:12,939
But you will never
change, Nico Robin.

204
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,675
No! That's not true!

205
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:20,080
Robin! Get away
from him! Watch out!

206
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,429
[LUFFY]
You bastard!

207
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,333
Stop yelling.

208
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,636
If you thaw her out
carefully, she'll live.

209
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,339
However, her body
is extremely fragile,

210
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,607
so you'll need to
handle her with care.

211
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:50,444
If she breaks, she'll die.

212
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,879
For example, if I were
to smash her apart.

213
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,981
[yelling]

214
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,485
[LUFFY]
Stop!

215
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,392
[AOKIJI]
Huh?

216
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,028
That was close.

217
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,664
[USOPP screaming]

218
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:14,802
[ALL cheering, laughing]

219
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,171
What in the hell are you doing?

220
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,874
Usopp, Chopper, quick! Take
Robin and run back to the ship!

221
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,442
Thaw her out and keep her safe!

222
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,478
[BOTH]
Right, you got it, Captain!

223
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,280
[SANJI] You're not gonna
mess with this crew!

224
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,415
Wait, nobody attack him!

225
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:32,953
[LUFFY]
Stay back, and don't interfere.

226
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:35,222
I'm gonna fight him one-on-one.

227
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,227
[LUFFY]
What do ya say?

228
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,163
The two of us can
settle this on our own.

229
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,664
Fine by me.

230
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:47,501
But since I don't have
a ship to take you back,

231
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,937
then I'll just have to kill you.

232
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,307
[LUFFY yelling]

233
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,764
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Storm!

234
00:18:28,876 --> 00:18:31,645
Now, it's Ice Time.

235
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,494
No, it's not lunch yet, Admiral.

236
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,631
What I'm talking about is
Portgas D. Ace's execution.

237
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:56,036
I know that, kid. I was
joking. Don't be so uptight.

238
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,140
[MARINE C]
Please hurry, sir.

239
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,509
Oh, they're summoning
us at noon, huh?

240
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:05,512
They could've at least
let us eat our lunch first.

241
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,149
[NARRATOR]
Admiral Kizaru.

242
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,056
[USOPP]
Zoro!

243
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,725
[USOPP screaming]

244
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,362
[groaning]

245
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,302
[USOPP] Who... Who are you?
Uhh, what are you?

246
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,338
Whatever! Just get the
hell away from Zoro!

247
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,206
[BROOK]
No, no, Zoro!

248
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,177
He got hit by one of
those laser beams!

249
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,311
Kizaru?

250
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,881
Hey, Usopp, be careful!
That man's a Navy Admiral!

251
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:44,617
An admiral? Uh-oh!

252
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,188
[KIZARU] Well, you'll have
plenty of time to rest up now.

253
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,093
Zoro!

254
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,497
Crap! He shoots beams too?

255
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,034
How're we 'sposed
to beat these guys?

256
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,003
At point blank like
that, he's done for!

257
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,873
Zoro's in trouble! Come
on, do something, guys!

258
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,475
[USOPP] Get away from him!
Back up or else!

259
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,543
Take this!

260
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,645
[gasps]

261
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,480
[USOPP]
What the hell? Why?

262
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:17,183
What is this? What's
happening? I can't hit him!

263
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,957
I-I can't stab him!
What the--? What can we do?

264
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,859
Keep trying! Dammit!

265
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:31,465
Get back! Move your foot!
I mean it! Leave him alone!

266
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,800
Step away from our friend!!

267
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,036
You're wasting your time.

268
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,206
I ate the Glint-Glint Fruit
and now I'm made of light.

269
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,608
It's a Logia, you see.

270
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,343
He's made of light?

271
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,980
[NAMI] This is a nightmare.
There's nothing we can do.

272
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,982
Zoro! Try to run away!

273
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,917
Now, Veinte Fleurs!

274
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,720
[KIZARU]
Huh?

275
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,196
It's cute how your
friends want to save you.

276
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,065
But you're far beyond help now.

277
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,571
[KIZARU]
Well then, time to die.

278
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,500
You picked some time
to come out of hiding.

279
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:46,273
[KIZARU] You sure you want to
do this, Dark King Rayleigh?

280
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:48,008
Rayleigh!

281
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,944
Don't go pickin' these
buds before they sprout.

282
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,147
Their era is only
just beginning.

283
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,482
And I wanna see
what they do with it.

284
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,954
I suppose if 'ole
Whitebeard is on the move,

285
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,424
we must put duty ahead
of our appetites, huh?

286
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,861
[NARRATOR]
Also at HQ is the Navy's

287
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:13,099
extreme Emissary of
Justice, Admiral Akainu.

288
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:25,145
[NARRATOR] The Navy's greatest
warriors, the three Admirals,

289
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:30,050
and the Seven
Warlords of the Sea.

290
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:32,787
Gathered at Marineford,
this formidable force

291
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,822
stands between Luffy
and his brother Ace.

292
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,829
[MARINE D] It's three
hours to the execution.

293
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:44,231
We have to take the
prisoner to the scaffold.

294
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,740
Time to go.

295
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,996
[NARRATOR] Fifty warships,
100 thousand Marines,

296
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,499
seven Warlords, and
the three Navy Admirals,

297
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,700
Akainu, Aokiji, and Kizaru.

298
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:23,604
The stage is set, and
Fleet Admiral Sengoku

299
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:25,439
reveals a shocking truth

300
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:28,041
as a battle with
Whitebeard looms.

301
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,643
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

302
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,645
"Ticking Down to
the Time of Battle!

303
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,481
The Navy's Strongest
Lineup in Position!"

304
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,850
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
