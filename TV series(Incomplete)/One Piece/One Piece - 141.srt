What's this?

176
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,423
The mayor is changing.

177
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,194
Oh, what now?

178
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,932
Flame Suit!

179
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,867
[SOLDIER A]
Commence fueling now!

180
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:55,401
[SOLDIER B]
Roger that!

181
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,403
Commencing fueling!

182
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,405
[SOLDIER C]
Internal tank pressure rising!

183
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,240
[SOLDIER D]
Safety valve released!

184
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,410
I'll burn the flesh
right off your bodies!

185
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,319
[RAPA NUI]
Hey, wait a minute!

186
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,954
Where are we going?

187
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,055
Isn't it obvious?

188
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,456
Back to our friends.

189
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,758
Are you serious?

190
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,494
You mean you really know a way
to get back to where they are?

191
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,462
Nope. Sure don't.

192
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,564
[RAPA NUI groans]

193
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,498
What's wrong?

194
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,234
So then, we're just
blindly running around?

195
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,936
Well no, not exactly.

196
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,337
I have a hunch, see?

197
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,506
That's the same
thing as blindly running!

198
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,075
I hope you realize that this
whole mess is your fault.

199
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,344
Why did you have to go and
knock me out here with you?

200
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,145
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,180
Saying sorry's
not going to help!

202
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,616
Henzo and I were finally
reunited as friends again,

203
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,485
and I didn't even get
a chance to shake his hand.

204
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,255
What's more, I'll never
get back to Luluka now.

205
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,623
Ever.

206
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,091
Damn it!

207
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,361
Now I'm going
to die in this mist.

208
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,530
Just like my dad did years ago.

209
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,264
[LUFFY]
Your dad?

210
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,166
Yeah, my dad was in the Marines.

211
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,334
He was an officer.

212
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,169
When I was a little kid, he
went off on a long journey

213
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,639
to explore some unknown
region of the sea.

214
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,140
Years afterward.

215
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,142
I was still waiting.

216
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,345
Waiting for him to come back.

217
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,948
My dad was off having these
grand adventures at sea.

218
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,517
That's what
I believed for years.

219
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,486
But then...

220
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,160
That's the ship!

221
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,662
Dad, no!

222
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,664
I searched the ship frantically.

223
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:35,301
But no matter how hard I looked,
I couldn't find him anywhere.

224
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,535
So I can tell you,

225
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,071
we're not going to
get out of here alive.

226
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,341
We'll be stuck
inside this mist forever.

227
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,382
Hey! Where are you going?

228
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,217
[LUFFY] I told you.
Back where our friends are.

229
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,885
[RAPA NUI]
But how do we do that?

230
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,253
You don't even know
where we are!

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,087
You're just going to keep

232
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,323
wandering through
the mist anyway?

233
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,557
What else should I do?

234
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:03,162
Standing still isn't gonna get
us back to where we need to be.

235
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,191
Usopp, did you find anything?

236
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,628
No. I didn't see a sign
of them anywhere.

237
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,364
It is possible that the two
of them were flung very far.

238
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,299
Enough to be beyond the mist.

239
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,801
But what's that mean?

240
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,768
Rapa Nui?

241
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,937
Is he not here anymore?

242
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,806
Quite possibly.

243
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,107
Oh no!

244
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,650
[ROBIN] That galleon there
is two hundred years old.

245
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,386
I've never seen
a ship like that before.

246
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,320
I wonder.

247
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,889
Is it possible that
inside Ape's Concert,

248
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,257
the course of time itself is‐‐

249
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,060
[NAMI]
Hey! You guys!

250
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,932
[USOPP]
Huh?

251
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,767
Oh, Nami. Hi.

252
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,001
[NAMI]
What do you mean, "Oh, Nami"?

253
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,903
Could you sound less excited?

254
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,306
And after I came all
the way here to rescue you!

255
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,407
How rude!

256
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,844
Oh yeah, you do seem
terribly broken up about it.

257
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,079
[NAMI]
Don't mind me.

258
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,281
Hey, uh, who are all
these children, anyway?

259
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,851
And where did
Luffy run off to this time?

260
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,754
You all look kinda upset?

261
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,255
What happened?

262
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,958
Well he, went beyond the mist.

263
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:39,859
Huh?

264
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,093
Like I said,
they're not here anymore,

265
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,762
and we can't find them, either.

266
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,864
What's this jibber‐jabber?

267
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,098
Exactly what he said.

268
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,801
You weren't here, so there's no
real way to explain it to you,

269
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,003
but they've gone
beyond the mist.

270
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,439
Okay. We'll withdraw!

271
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,040
Huh?!

272
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,775
Are you crazy?

273
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,777
Have you forgotten about Luffy?

274
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,677
I don't know
what happened,

275
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,946
but what are the
chances that he's dead?

276
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,781
He can handle it.

277
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,948
Just leave him be.

278
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,016
Come on, we're heading back!

279
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,119
So you've found a way
for us to escape from here?

280
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,721
Kind of, yeah.

281
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,455
It's a rope.

282
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,457
Ah come on.

283
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,193
[IAN] So you're the one
who came from Luluka, huh?

284
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,961
[ALL]
Huh?

285
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,731
Ian!

286
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,166
And he's, who?

287
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,467
He's a Wetton crony.

288
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,135
One of Wetton's men, huh?

289
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,137
So what's he doing here?

290
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,842
[IAN] Why don't you hand
that rope over to me, girlie?

291
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,843
But why?

292
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,011
If you're looking for
a way to get yourself

293
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,080
out of the Rainbow Mist then
you can just come with us.

294
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,050
Don't you care what
happens to this little boy?

295
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,821
Why should I?

296
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,822
Really?

297
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,356
I don't know who he his anyway,

298
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,525
and I'm not really nice enough
to help out some little kid

299
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,327
who I've never even seen before.

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,162
Well, yeah. I can't argue.

301
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,996
Wait a second!

302
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,864
What are you saying?

303
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,365
I'll shoot the boy.
I'm not kidding!

304
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,502
Ahh! Murderer!

305
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,504
Come on!

306
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,505
Please help him!

307
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,506
Don't be silly.

308
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,074
Why me?

309
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,509
Hey, easy!

310
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,511
[ISOKA] I don't want to lose
any more of my friends,

311
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,180
so please just do what
he's asking you lady!

312
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,784
Good decision, Isoka.
Now why don't you go ahead

313
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,787
and attach that lifeline
to the boat there.

314
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,392
Now, why don't you come
along with me, Isoka?

315
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,527
With all this treasure,

316
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,896
we'll never have to work
again as long as we live.

317
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,964
You don't get it, do you?

318
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,566
Rapa Nui is the only
leader that we'll ever have.

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,036
And I have no intention of
following some jackass like you.

320
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,805
What?

321
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,372
Ow!

322
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,807
Run away, Isoka!

323
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,141
[IAN]
Brat!

324
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,110
[ISOKA]
Rongo!

325
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,912
[IAN]
You're not going anywhere.

326
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,213
[USOPP]
Leave her alone!

327
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,484
Ugh! Damn it! Stop that!

328
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,052
Let me go!

329
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,556
[gasps]

330
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,057
[ZORO]
Hey! What happened?

331
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,559
[ROBIN]
Sea Prism Stone.

332
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,960
[ZORO]
Really?

333
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,964
[IAN]
Damn!

334
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,401
You jerk. Come back.

335
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,069
You better not miss him, okay?

336
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,970
Hurry up and shoot!

337
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,839
[USOPP] Calm down,
let me shoot, would you?

338
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,973
[NAMI]
Shoot him! Shoot him!

339
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,808
[USOPP]
He's too far away.

340
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,478
Now it's time.

341
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,179
To burn.

342
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,083
[CHOPPER]
It's no use.

343
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,019
I can't get away
from him like this.

344
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,922
Rumble!

345
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,596
[WETTON]
Lake! Get him!

346
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,633
[LAKE] Electroshock Suit
Maximum Output!

347
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,268
You're finished!

348
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,103
Dragon Spark!

349
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,140
[SANJI]
Chopper!

350
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,208
Always watch your opponent, boy!

351
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,945
What is this thing?

352
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,514
Silver Barbeque.

353
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,949
[SANJI]
Barbeque?

354
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,953
[WETTON] You think you can come
here and do whatever you please?

355
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,620
Think again.

356
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,189
We'll show you your place!

357
00:15:59,224 --> 00:15:59,792
Grandpa!

358
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,293
The rope! It's pulling!

359
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,461
[FLIP]
You can't be serious!

360
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,063
You mean that girl
is really coming back

361
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,397
from inside the mist?

362
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,565
Impossible!

363
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,300
Well, pull her back to shore.

364
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,635
Right.

365
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:11,637
No way.

366
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,871
[LAKE]
What?

367
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,374
I promised, that until Nami
returned from the Rainbow Mist,

368
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,977
no one would lay a
finger on that rope, so.

369
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,411
[WETTON]
Ridiculous!

370
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,379
Promises are only words!

371
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,581
You just want to get
a hold of the treasure!

372
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,484
But do you really want it
badly enough to die?

373
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,052
[SANJI]
We're not after any treasure,

374
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,388
but Nami is going to come back.

375
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,324
So we're going to
do whatever it takes

376
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,161
to make sure she returns
safely, no matter what.

377
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,168
Joue Shoot!

378
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,340
This pretense of
friendship is disgusting.

379
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,010
Mayor! There's a boat
heading towards the shore!

380
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,011
[WETTON]
All right.

381
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,513
Pull the rope, and lead
the boat straight to us.

382
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,251
Those kids are morons.

383
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,421
They can just live inside this
mist forever for all I care.

384
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,023
Ooh!

385
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,026
Feels so nice,
being back under an open sky!

386
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,193
Oh, finally!

387
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,228
There it is!

388
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,262
I can see it!

389
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,631
The town of Luluka!

390
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,067
Huh?! Is that?

391
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,440
[CHOPPER]
Nami isn't in the boat.

392
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,709
Who are you?

393
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,277
Sorry to be away so long.

394
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,980
I'm raider captain Ian.

395
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,049
I'm very pleased to see
you, Captain Wetton.

396
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,750
And you're looking
even better than ever!

397
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,218
Huh? Me?

398
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,586
Yes, I'm doing well.

399
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,387
Thanks.

400
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:35,988
[FLIP]
Ian?

401
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,623
[WETTON]
Ian's your name?

402
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,390
Really?

403
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,559
The same Ian who
served under me?

404
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,260
Huh?!

405
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,396
Hey, Captain, who's the old guy?

406
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,397
Uh, uh‐‐

407
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
I'm the captain here.

408
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,267
I'm Wetton, you fool.

409
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,568
[IAN]
Really? Then who is this?

410
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,236
[WETTON]
My grandson, Lake.

411
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,438
[FLIP]
And I'm his son, Phillip.

412
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,672
Huh?

413
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,507
You mean you're really that
bedwetting pipsqueak Phillip?

414
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,409
And you have a son
of your own now?

415
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,079
You've gotta be kidding me.

416
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,280
[FLIP]
Stop laughing, all of you!

417
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,281
Stop now!

418
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,616
So old friend, tell me
what it's like in there.

419
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,918
Uh, sure.

420
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,656
[USOPP] Here. Captain Usopp's
super special hot chocolate.

421
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,824
Thank you!

422
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,424
[AKIBI]
Well?

423
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,159
[HENZO]
It's no use.

424
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,427
When we were able
to get a signal

425
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,196
from outside and make contact,

426
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,864
it must have been
a temporary thing.

427
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,266
Of all the bad luck‐‐to
have a piece of jewelry

428
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,868
with a sea prism stone in it

429
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,870
among all the
treasure on that boat.

430
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,638
What is that thing?

431
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,340
It's a type of sea crystal.

432
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,341
It has the unique power

433
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,177
to cancel out anyone's
Devil Fruit abilities.

434
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,812
[NAMI] Hmm...
What's the point of having

435
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,781
so much beautiful treasure

436
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,650
if we can't even take it outside
of this stupid mist with us?

437
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,651
You're a navigator, aren't you?

438
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,386
Can't you do something about it?

439
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,454
[NAMI]
Nope.

440
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,523
This absurd area of
the sea is a first for me.

441
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,824
We're out of options then.

442
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,327
Not really. I guarantee
they'll be coming here.

443
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,228
What for?

444
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,462
Wetton's ultimate
goal has always been

445
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,732
to get all the treasure out of
Ape's Concert for himself.

446
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,834
And now that his man
Ian has returned alive,

447
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,569
he'll be putting
together a large force

448
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,705
and charging into
the mist very soon.

449
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,640
[NAMI]
You've gotta be kidding me!

450
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:02,641
Then we'll fight.

451
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,843
I'm not handing over
this treasure to anyone!

452
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,647
I wish Rapa Nui
was back here with us.

453
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,323
Hey. Come on.

454
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,491
You have to get up now.

455
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,659
Okay?

456
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,428
[ISOKA]
No matter how much we paddle,

457
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,265
we just wind up back
where we started.

458
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,499
[AKIBI]
It's impossible.

459
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,369
We're never going to make it
out of this stupid mist, are we?

460
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,838
Is that really so bad?

461
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,706
We're the only ones
in here, right?

462
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,609
We can sleep whenever we want,
play whenever we want.

463
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,877
It's our own paradise.

464
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,845
We're free here,

465
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,213
and we'll never die!

466
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,514
Rapa Nui!

467
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,383
We never have
to go home, you see?

468
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,619
So let's stay here and
make a land all our own!

469
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:48,921
Only now,

470
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,023
I really want to go home.

471
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,291
Back to Luluka.

472
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,392
That's home!

473
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:58,697
Is that?

474
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,868
Dad! Dad!

475
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,975
What's that light there?

476
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,909
What?

477
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,944
It looks like...

478
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,545
[RAPA NUI]
...an exit!

479
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,216
[WETTON]
Finally.

480
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,418
After 50 years of
waiting and working,

481
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,587
my plan will be
completed at last.

482
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:28,293
The Rainbow Mist and this world
will be joined together forever.

483
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,948

Everyone!

485
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,500
Hurry up and
grab on to something!

[ZORO]
What the hell is that?

487
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,476
[HENZO]
It's the Rainbow Tower.

488
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,845
That was a close one!

489
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:20,712
Here's your hat.

490
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,680
Thank you.

491
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,982
By the way, what is
that thing over there?

492
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,617
[RAPA NUI] I guess it's what
they're planning to use

493
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,386
to invade Ape's Concert.

494
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,787
What do you mean by "they"?

495
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,788
Never mind that now.

496
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,555
We have to get going.

Everyone's in danger.

00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,831
So Wetton, you've finally come.

Get going. Faster now.
