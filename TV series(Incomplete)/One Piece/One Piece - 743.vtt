00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.585
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:20.233
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats formed
a pirate alliance with Law

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.606
and defeated
the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.243
who had seized
control of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:28.216
Now, at last,
the kingdom is at peace.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.788
However, in the
aftermath of the battle,

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.560
the Navy Admiral Fujitora
sweeps in to capture

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:36.867
every pirate on the island
before they can escape.

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.238
[BARTOLOMEO]
Mister Zoro!

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.042
You and your friends
should stay back.

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.210
Leave this one to me!

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.549
[neighs]

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:47.855
Leave it to "us," you mean!

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.842
[SENGOKU] We've lost
a lot of good Marines.

00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:00.147
But it was different
when I lost him.

00:04:00.247 --> 00:04:02.284
He was special to me.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.957
We met when he was a child.

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:07.729
I thought of him as my own son.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.633
He was as honest as they came,

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:12.004
with an unshakeable
sense of justice.

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:14.843
Naturally, he had
my absolute trust.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:21.422
[SENGOKU] Regardless, he did lie
to me once, in the very end.

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:23.927
[MALE MARINE J]
Landing unit here.

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:27.268
Among the dead,
there's a Don Quixote Exec.

00:04:27.702 --> 00:04:29.438
His code name is Corazon.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.841
[SENGOKU gasps]

00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.594
[SENGOKU] Rosinante! What were
you doing on that island?

00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:48.142
[SENGOKU] But I know
he must have had a reason.

00:04:48.442 --> 00:04:52.084
There were four things that
were lost during that incident.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:54.355
The Barrels Pirate crew.

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:56.693
The life of poor Rosinante.

00:04:57.962 --> 00:04:59.498
The Op-Op Fruit.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:01.837
And of course the young boy

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:05.611
who was with the
Don Quixote Family then.

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.550
The one with
the White Lead Disease.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.592
Yeah. That was me.

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:16.365
[LUFFY]
"Men's Pride!

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:19.806
Luffy vs. Fujitora,
Head-to-Head!"

00:05:31.328 --> 00:05:32.832
I thought so.

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:39.713
So when Rosinante
stepped away from his mission

00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.783
for that half of a year
before he died,

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.620
it was to help you, wasn't it?

00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:45.891
[LAW]
That's right.

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.628
He took me to
countless hospitals.

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.433
[SENGOKU]
But that failed,

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:51.604
so he set his sights
on the Op-Op Fruit,

00:05:51.704 --> 00:05:53.372
and when things went south,

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:55.644
he sacrificed himself
to save you?

00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:03.728
Since he meant so much
to me, I must ask.

00:06:03.828 --> 00:06:05.831
What exactly did he die for?

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.914
My life. Everything.

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:15.585
Even though we weren't able to

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.187
leave together
like we'd planned,

00:06:17.287 --> 00:06:20.761
he gave me back my freedom,
and my will to live.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.167
[LAW]
I'm forever in his debt.

00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:26.874
That's why I carried this out.

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:29.746
To take down Doflamingo
and avenge his death!

00:06:33.052 --> 00:06:35.858
But now, I wonder
if that was my fate

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.031
as a "D." all along and he knew.

00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:40.033
"D."?

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:44.141
The same secret name
as Straw Hat.

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.713
Though I still don't know
what that amounts to.

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.055
[LAW] Since you used to be
the Fleet Admiral,

00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:52.592
perhaps you can tell me.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.631
What's the meaning
behind that letter?

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.399
I couldn't say.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.069
[LAW]
Don't play dumb with me!

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.941
I can tell you one thing.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:20.047
Rosinante didn't know
any more about "D." than you.

00:07:20.147 --> 00:07:21.650
[LAW gasps]

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.052
[SENGOKU] In other words,
that wasn't the reason

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.722
why he saved your life.

00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:28.997
He didn't need a reason.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.538
He did it out of love.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.049
[ROSINANTE]
I love you, kid!

00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.295
[SENGOKU]
Another "D.," huh?

00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:47.902
It's true. They always
follow a checkered fate.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.845
Shame I'm not on active duty.

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:54.682
I would have
locked you in a cell,

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:57.556
where we could have had
a nice, long chat about this.

00:07:57.656 --> 00:07:59.058
You're the only
person I can share

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:02.397
all of my fond memories
of Rosinante with.

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:04.936
How unfortunate
that you're a pirate.

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.440
If you want to
honor his memory,

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.044
you can do the same
as I've done.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.150
Never mind revenge.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.922
Just keep him in
your heart, always.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.297
[SENGOKU]
Live the life that you desire.

00:08:19.397 --> 00:08:20.868
One that makes you happy.

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:23.907
He fought to set you free.

00:08:25.243 --> 00:08:27.247
That's what he would want.

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:42.077
Heheh. Gimme your worst.

00:08:42.177 --> 00:08:44.949
My barrier ain't
goin' down that easy!

00:09:02.317 --> 00:09:02.918
[ALL]
Huh?

00:09:03.754 --> 00:09:05.658
That barrier over there?

00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:07.728
You're giving me
a real challenge today.

00:09:08.429 --> 00:09:09.832
[gasps]

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.644
This looks bad!

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:29.839
[LAW gasps]
What the hell?

00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:32.043
Interesting.

00:09:35.952 --> 00:09:38.022
He's not holding back.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:40.728
[TOWNSMAN A]
Whoa! What?

00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:41.963
[TOWNSMAN B]
It's floating!

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:43.600
[TOWNSMAN C]
Get outta there!

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.038
That's messed up!
What's causing this?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.808
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
The buildings--

00:09:47.908 --> 00:09:49.411
They're lifting
straight into the air!

00:09:49.512 --> 00:09:51.115
[TOWNSMAN E] They're not
gonna drop, are they?

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:52.484
[TOWNSMAN F]
No, it looks like they're all

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.321
going to the port in the east!

00:09:54.421 --> 00:10:00.399
[GYATS] Ladies and gentlemen,
do my eyes deceive me?

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.471
Is this the work of a god?

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:05.109
Or giant, invisible
birds, perhaps?

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:08.182
No. There's only one person
on the island--

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:11.054
or possibly in the
world capable of this!

00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:13.793
[gasping]

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:18.737
[GYATS] This is the work
of Navy Admiral Fujitora!

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.024
Pardon me,
but since you don't need

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:30.794
all this debris and rubble,

00:10:30.894 --> 00:10:33.266
I thought I might
put it to good use.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.540
Those infernal pirates are
the ones who made this mess.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.710
So let them feel its weight.

00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:42.284
So now what? We're screwed!

00:10:42.384 --> 00:10:43.954
How do we fight back?

00:10:44.054 --> 00:10:46.693
[CHIN JAO chuckles]
One things for certain--

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:48.496
We're going to need
a much bigger barrier!

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:50.266
Or a different strategy!

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.503
That's crazy!

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.940
C'mon, that's cheating! Jeez!

00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:57.515
[DWARVES scream]

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:59.484
What is that in the sky?

00:10:59.586 --> 00:11:02.157
[gasps] It's no time to be
screaming in terror!

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.862
We gotta go help
the Usolanders, somehow!

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:07.300
It can't be! This is mad!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.939
That's how he intends
to capture all the pirates?

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:12.878
They'll be dead!
No one can survive that!

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:15.685
[KYROS]
This is a disaster!

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:17.821
Their escape fell
apart so quickly!

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:22.865
Lucy!

00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.377
Vice Admiral Bastille.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:32.552
Hey, Bastille!

00:11:32.652 --> 00:11:36.760
[BASTILLE] Mm? Oh, uh, yes,
hello Tsuru. My apologies.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.830
I was overwhelmed for a second.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.803
Well? Still need
those reinforcements?

00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:43.774
[BASTILLE]
No. We're good.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:45.577
All units, withdraw!

00:11:45.678 --> 00:11:48.182
We no longer need
reinforcements at the port!

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:51.589
Evacuate from the
east side of the kingdom!

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.929
Any civilians you see
should also be evacuated

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:56.833
to a safe location!

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.570
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:03.445
[BASTILLE] Let Issho--I mean,
Admiral Issho--do his job!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.890
[USOPP gasping]

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:12.831
[USOPP]
How is this even possible?!

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:25.891
[LAW]
Hey! Guys!

00:12:26.526 --> 00:12:28.764
No place in this kingdom
is safe from this!

00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:29.999
Set sail now!

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.636
All right, then, Trafal--

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:35.811
Gah! Law! We've been waiting
for you and Straw Hat!

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.113
Where were you two?

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:41.556
Run to the ship!
It's time to sail out!

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:42.959

Uh, yeah!

When I said run, I meant it!

[CAVENDISH]
Hurry! Come on!

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.039
I'm fine with getting
the hell outta this place.

00:12:50.841 --> 00:12:53.980
But I have a feeling he's
not gonna let us off that easy.

00:13:07.675 --> 00:13:09.011
Hey! Finally!

00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:12.216
He's here! Luffy!

[BARTOLOMEO] We gotta
haul some ass, Mister Luffy!

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:19.900

That's everybody!
Let's move out!

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.146
Mister Luffy! There's an
angry Fujitora in your way!

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:32.490
It's that guy.

00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:35.564
That's quite a mouth
on you, Straw Hat.

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:36.833
However.

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.670
You wanna fight?

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.641
I don't suppose you'd back down?

Mister Luffy, everybody's
making a run for it now!

Just dodge him! Be careful!

00:13:58.042 --> 00:13:59.913
Just dodge him?

Hey! Gambler Man!

Do you remember me?

00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:06.927
[FUJITORA] Of course.
I've been waiting for you.

00:14:07.027 --> 00:14:08.863

Get ready for a fight!

00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:17.581
Gum-Gum Elephant Gun!

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:22.658
[BARTOLOMEO]
M-M-M-Mister Luffy!

00:14:22.758 --> 00:14:25.330
That's a Navy Admiral
you just walloped!

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.302
One of the toughest Marines
in the whole dang world!

00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:49.178
[LUFFY]
'Cause you got one coming!

00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:53.185
Gum-Gum Elephant Gun!

00:14:57.427 --> 00:15:02.938
[LUFFY grunting]

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:06.112
Mister Luffy, why?

00:15:06.212 --> 00:15:08.449
We're supposed to
be running away!

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.188
Don't pick a fight
with that guy!

00:15:12.023 --> 00:15:14.093
Beating him "someday"
isn't good enough.

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:16.432
Why should I run away?

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:18.703
Why should I back down
from the Navy?

00:15:18.803 --> 00:15:20.875
I did that two years ago.

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.145
But I'm done with that now!

00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:24.549
[USOPP, FRANKY gasp]

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:28.189
Everyone! Start running
and look after yourselves!

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:30.460
We can't win this one!

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:32.063
We're too weak!

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.840
[LUFFY] I don't care
if it's a Navy Admiral

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.743
or one of the Four Emperors.

00:15:38.843 --> 00:15:40.681
I gotta beat 'em all someday.

00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:42.049
Cause if I don't...

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:46.993
...then I'll never be
King of the Pirates!

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:54.842
Yeah. Can't argue with that one.

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:57.113
[USOPP groans]
Okay, fine!

00:15:57.213 --> 00:15:59.719
If you gotta kick his ass,
then do it right!

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:02.925
Huh?! Mister Usopp, too?

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:05.262
Really? Are you sure?

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:11.643
I'm going all out! Get ready!

00:16:11.743 --> 00:16:14.147
Good. Then I shall
do my best to match

00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:16.184
your conviction with my own.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.355
Might get ugly.

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:21.729
I'm gonna punch you!

00:16:22.932 --> 00:16:24.735
Gum-Gum...

00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:28.141
[LUFFY]
...Hawk Bullet!

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:30.212
[BARTOLOMEO yells]
We need to get out of here,

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:31.949
but I wanna watch this fight!

00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:33.953
You really are a nuisance!

00:16:34.053 --> 00:16:35.422
Should we fight him, too?

00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:38.930
Now I'm gonna stomp you!

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.569
Gum-Gum...

00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:44.608
...Hawk Axe!

00:16:45.944 --> 00:16:48.182
I'm on board with
the stuff that Luffy said.

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:50.185
But calling out all his moves?

00:16:50.286 --> 00:16:52.591
Is this some kind of
weird power play, or what?

00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:55.095
Why do you keep
warning him, Luffy?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.682
[LUFFY] Let's see
how you handle this one.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:08.156
I'm gonna punch you really fast!

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:11.896
Gum-Gum Hawk Gatling!

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:16.939
[yelling]

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:18.275
[grunts]

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:21.414
Now I'm gonna kick you!

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:26.592
Next, a kick and a punch!

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:32.905
What'd'ya do to me?

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:33.940
Get up!

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:35.644
[LUFFY]
Oh, right.

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:38.549
You have Devil Fruit Powers,
I almost forgot.

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.460
Now head-butt!

00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:48.703
Huh?

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:55.115
I'm gonna kick you!

00:17:57.286 --> 00:17:58.890
[gasps] I meant "punch"!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.292
So sorry about that!

00:18:01.194 --> 00:18:02.764
Got carried away, there.

00:18:03.465 --> 00:18:05.269
[FUJITORA]
No need to concern yourself.

00:18:05.369 --> 00:18:07.541
It was no threat to me.

00:18:19.063 --> 00:18:21.034
Okay, you ready, old man?

00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:25.711
[yelling]

00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:27.681
Gonna punch you!

00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:28.716
[yells]

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:32.658
Now a kick and a punch!

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:36.599
[LUFFY]
Now punching really fast!

00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:41.676
A shove! Head-butt! A big stomp!

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.517
[gasps]

00:18:59.177 --> 00:19:03.920
[LUFFY gasping]

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:05.657
First he makes me super heavy

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:07.627
and then he
makes me super light?

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:10.634
That looked bad.

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.270
I get that you're
being a badass,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.508
but I really think
you should run away!

00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:24.193
No more running. Not anymore.

00:19:24.996 --> 00:19:26.464
I see.

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:28.503
With your strength,
that's reasonable enough.

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.607
I do admire your spirit.

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:34.948
I'm gonna punch you!

00:19:35.048 --> 00:19:37.153
But this strategy of yours

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:39.390
I find rather confounding!

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:44.100
[FUJITORA] Why are you
announcing all of your attacks?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.804
Are you taking pity on me?

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:49.277
[FUJITORA]
Have you forgotten?

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:50.880
I'm a Navy Admiral!

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.653
I'm feared as a monster,
far and wide.

00:19:53.753 --> 00:19:55.657
I haven't achieved
this level of strength

00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:59.364
only to suffer your
misguided sympathy.

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.869
Are you troubled to see
a blind man on the battlefield?

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:04.809
Does my prowess
not speak for itself?

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.850
If you'd hoped to aggravate me,
then you've succeeded.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.023
You can laugh your way to the
grave while I take your head!

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.358
Oh, shut up!

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:14.828
No matter how strong you are,

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:16.932
if I attack you and
you can't see it coming,

00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:18.703
then that's like cheating!

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.741
[grunts]

00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:24.480
You're Navy, but that
doesn't mean I don't like you!

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:43.553
[laughing]

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:48.228
Hey! What are you
laughing at? You jerk!

00:20:48.328 --> 00:20:50.366
I'm gonna kick you!

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:52.436
What good is your sympathy?

00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:56.879
[FUJITORA] Your act of mercy
will gain you nothing.

00:20:56.979 --> 00:20:59.450
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna punch you a bunch!

00:20:59.552 --> 00:21:01.287
[FUJITORA] I thought you
were a man of conviction,

00:21:01.387 --> 00:21:04.595
but it seems you're strung along
by some whimsical nonsense!

00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:05.997
Here comes a punch!

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.874
[yells]

00:21:10.974 --> 00:21:13.813
Really hard!

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:16.886
When a man enters
a battle like this,

00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:20.894
no matter his side,
he has a standing to uphold!

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:24.601
[FUJITORA]
That leaves no room for pity.

00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.973
No matter how sincere
your feelings are,

00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:29.545
they have no place
in this struggle.

00:21:35.455 --> 00:21:36.892
Shut up!

00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:40.032
You can't tell me
how to feel or what to do!

00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:46.579
I don't desire this fight,
but I believe in my duty,

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:49.016
and I won't be
selfish, like you!

00:21:49.183 --> 00:21:50.553
[LUFFY gasps]

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:52.691
[FUJITORA]
Gravity Blade!

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.028
[ZORO]
Aw, crap! Run!

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.504
Raging Tiger!

00:22:37.012 --> 00:22:39.585
[LUFFY gasps]

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:05.536
[FUJITORA panting]

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.926
[NARRATOR] Luffy and his allies
rush to escape Dressrosa

00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:20.465
as the ruins of the kingdom loom
precariously over their heads.

00:23:20.566 --> 00:23:22.871
But Admiral Fujitora
will not be deterred

00:23:22.971 --> 00:23:25.275
and hounds their
every strep relentlessly.

00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:26.645
When the pirates are left with

00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:28.081
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide,

00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:30.887
he rains down his
terrifying final attack.

00:23:30.987 --> 00:23:32.825
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.925 --> 00:23:34.027
"No Way Out!

00:23:34.127 --> 00:23:36.632
Admiral Fujitora's
Ruthless Pursuit!"

00:23:36.732 --> 00:23:39.571
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
