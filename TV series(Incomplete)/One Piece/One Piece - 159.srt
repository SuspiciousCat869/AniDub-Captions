1
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:43,408
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:48,788
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:53,293
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,963
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:01,885
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:05,055
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,432
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,978
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,939
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,233
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:25,533
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,036
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,663
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:35,669
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,088
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,715
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,639
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:50,100
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,395
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,647
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,732
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,777
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,279
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:07,992
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,787
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:18,169
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:29,222
[NARRATOR] After a long
and arduous adventure,

30
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:31,099
Luffy and his crew
finally reached

31
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:34,561
their mystical island
destination of Skypiea.

32
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:39,357
[NARRATOR] However, when Nami,
Zoro, Robin, and Chopper

33
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:41,568
were carried off to face
Heaven's Judgment,

34
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,695
Luffy and his remaining crew
set out to Upper Yard

35
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,447
to rescue their friends.

36
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,240
Fortunately, their
new friend Conis

37
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,200
was there to show them the way.

38
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,202
Presenting the Crow!

39
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,497
Ah! You're kidding me, right?

40
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:56,833
[SANJI]
Wait, uh.

41
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,877
Crows don't even swim.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,546
[CONIS]
Your exit is Gate Number Two.

43
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,298
It leads right to
the Milky Road,

44
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:06,968
and that will take you all
the way to Upper Yard.

45
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,387
Just follow it
and you'll be fine.

46
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,476
[LUFFY]
Hey, Conis.

47
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,685
Yes?

48
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,937
You've been trembling
ever since we left.

49
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:19,814
Is everything okay?

50
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,860
[PAGAYA] Oh, Conis,
please forgive me.

51
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:26,279
But it's every citizen's duty.

52
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:29,074
[CONIS]
Just run away. Please.

53
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,618
I called the Super
Express Lobster!

54
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:33,620
It was all my fault!

55
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,038
Once we know
someone's a criminal,

56
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,248
we must lead them to Upper Yard.

57
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,669
If we don't, then
the penalty is death!

58
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:51,388
[PIERRE]
Pi-e!

59
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:55,809
Conis! Look she's safe!

60
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:02,691
I-I know who you really are.

61
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,651
We-We all know.

62
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:07,821
Please come back to us... God.

63
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,283
[LUFFY] "Onward, Crow!
To the Sacrificial Altar!"

64
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,498
I really hope Conis
is all right.

65
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,916
You know she's gonna
have hell to pay

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,501
when the White Berets
catch up with her

67
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:23,086
and it's our own stupid fault.

68
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,005
She'd be okay if she
hadn't helped us.

69
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:27,132
And I'm not sure she can
trust that Sky Knight.

70
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,967
He pretty much
gives me the creeps.

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,385
He's kinda old and weird,

72
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,345
but he doesn't seem like
that bad of a guy.

73
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,805
There was no other choice.

74
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,306
I wanna protect her,

75
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,559
but it's not like we could've
brought her along with us.

76
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:40,729
Well, then she probably is
in less danger without us.

77
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,314
"Sacrificial altars," "ordeals."

78
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:44,733
And the sound of it,

79
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,569
I wish I was the one flying
off with the old geezer.

80
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,863
Man, this piece of junk is slow.

81
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,406
Of course it is.

82
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,700
It's gotta be several times
heavier than a standard waver.

83
00:04:53,783 --> 00:04:55,452
What'd you expect?

84
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:02,500
Uh, guys! Where did that
huge forest come from?

85
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,044
[SANJI]
Is that the Upper Yard?

86
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,172
[LUFFY] I don't remember
this being on the map.

87
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,423
Wait.

88
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:10,091
No, there is supposed
to be a forest ahead,

89
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,761
but I don't see any warning
about how big it is.

90
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:14,763
This cannot be right!

91
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,848
[SANJI]
Who knows how old that map is.

92
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,059
We know it can be traced back
a couple hundred years,

93
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:21,186
but who's to say it hasn't
been around longer?

94
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,146
The forest may have been
a fraction of its size

95
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,731
when that map was made.

96
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,232
[USOPP]
Ah, that's true.

97
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:29,319
[LUFFY] All I know is, I gotta
climb one of these trees!

98
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,405
Ha! They're enormous!

99
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:37,744
[LUFFY]
Look, the entrance!

100
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,412
[SANJI]
Well, this is it, Usopp.

101
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:41,706
If you're gonna chicken out,
now's the time.

102
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,916
[USOPP]
Actually, if you don't mind,

103
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,709
I was kind of thinking
I'd like to go back.

104
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:45,710
[LUFFY]
Too late!

105
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,337
[USOPP]
Then why did you ask me?!

106
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,736
[caws]

107
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,779
[USOPP]
Wh-What was that?

108
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:14,364
[LUFFY]
Would you calm down?

109
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:15,740
[SANJI]
Yeah, take it easy.

110
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:16,950
[USOPP]
Open your eyes!

111
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,035
Don't you notice
anything strange?

112
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,787
Look at all these shipwrecks!

113
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,205
[LUFFY]
It is a forest.

114
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:23,248
[SANJI]
He's right.

115
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,457
[USOPP]
That doesn't make any sense!

116
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,292
Besides, they didn't
run aground--

117
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,877
they were sliced in half!

118
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:28,712
[rustling]

119
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:29,796
Did you hear that?

120
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,965
The woods are full
of noises. Relax.

121
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:32,590
[SANJI]
I heard that.

122
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:33,508
[USOPP screams]

123
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,718
[USOPP]
Full speed ahead!

124
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:36,094
All ahead full!

125
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:36,845
Stroke! Stroke!

126
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,472
[LUFFY]
What's going on?

127
00:06:39,556 --> 00:06:41,141
Hm?

128
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,059
[ALL scream]

129
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:46,062
A sickle monster!

130
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,857
Hang on tight, here
comes another one!

131
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,361
No. Not just one.

132
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,783
Paddle like crazy!

133
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:04,581
[ALL yelling]

134
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,041
[USOPP screams]

135
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,127
[SANJI]
What the hell is this?!

136
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,463
[USOPP]
Watch where you're going!

137
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:12,922
Luffy! No, wait! Slow down!

138
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,592
This isn't working.
Usopp, take the wheel!

139
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,926
Gum-Gum...

140
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,511
[USOPP] What are you doing?
It's in front of us!

141
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,221
[LUFFY]
I know, just hang on!

142
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:23,767
...Bazooka!

143
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,310
Ha-ha! Dodged it!

144
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,562
[USOPP]
Whoa! That was close!

145
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,611
Great, there's more?

146
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:41,117
Spears? Are you kidding me?

147
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:41,993
[LUFFY]
Usopp, right!

148
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:42,660
[SANJI]
No, left!

149
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:43,411
[USOPP]
Which one?

150
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,871
[SANJI]
Just dodge 'em!

151
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,337
They won't stop!

152
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,922
One of  'em's bound
to hit us eventually!

153
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,174
All right, guys, get ready.

154
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:59,260
Gum-Gum Pinwheel!

155
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:02,430
[sighs]

156
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:03,973
That was close.

157
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:08,103
I hope that's all over with.
I can't take any more scares.

158
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,359
[USOPP]
Eh? Oh, now what?

159
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,694
[USOPP screaming]

160
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:16,736
It's gone!

161
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,029
Not yet!

162
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:20,782
[USOPP]
It's coming back!

163
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:22,951
--[SANJI] Move it!
--[LUFFY] Dodge!

164
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,789
I can't believe that
overgrown crustacean

165
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,333
just dropped us out in
the middle of nowhere.

166
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,461
Does anybody know
where we are?

167
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,921
[NAMI]
One thing's for certain,

168
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,466
we're definitely somewhere
in the middle of Upper Yard.

169
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,801
[ROBIN]
Hmm.

170
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:42,095
This seems to be some sort
of altar for sacrifices.

171
00:08:42,178 --> 00:08:45,181
[NAMI]
Altar? Wait, sacrifices?

172
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,308
Nami, what's a sacrifice?

173
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,769
[NAMI] You know, like,
an offering to the gods.

174
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,062
Oh, is that all?

175
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,689
I thought it meant
being boiled alive

176
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:54,399
in a big stew or something.

177
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:57,527
[screaming]

178
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,988
Actually, that's about right.

179
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,406
But regardless of the method,

180
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,575
the thing being offered is
generally someone's life.

181
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:04,993
[CHOPPER screams]

182
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,203
Are you tryin' to tell me
we're all gonna die here?!

183
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,039
Whoa!

184
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:10,540
[NAMI]
Chopper!

185
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,958
Damn it.

186
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:17,756
[sighs]

187
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,763
[CREATURE roars]

188
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:27,807
[screaming]

189
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,184
Oh, no! What's that?

190
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,144
A shark. In the sky.

191
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,312
A "skyshark"?

192
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,897
[CHOPPER screaming]

193
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,608
Zoro! Zoro!

194
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,870
[ZORO]
I can't see anything down here.

195
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:50,663
Where the hell is it?

196
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,345
[ZORO]
Way out of my element.

197
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,014
Can't maneuver like
I can on land.

198
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,236
[LUFFY screaming]

199
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,570
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

200
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,406
[LUFFY yelling]

201
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:25,532
[USOPP]
It missed us.

202
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,992
Oh! Not again!

203
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,997
[USOPP]
I'm sick of this place!

204
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,083
We're never gonna
make it outta here!

205
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,085
I'm going back! I don't
care what you say!

206
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:38,378
[LUFFY]
No, you're not!

207
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,755
[USOPP] Shut up!
I'm captain of the Crow!

208
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:41,589
[LUFFY]
Since when?

209
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:42,674
[USOPP]
Since now!

210
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:44,217
Even if we do turn around,

211
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,720
there's no guarantee we'll
survive the trip back.

212
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,263
Damn.

213
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:49,973
[USOPP screaming]

214
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,684
[USOPP]
Doesn't that thing ever quit?

215
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,395
Let's see how you like
a little Gum-Gum, huh?

216
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,146
[USOPP]
Yeah!

217
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:57,522
[SANJI]
Get it, Luffy!

218
00:10:59,232 --> 00:10:59,941
[LUFFY]
I got nothin'.

219
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,276
[USOPP screams]

220
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,155
[SANJI]
That only leaves us one choice.

221
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:06,698
Try and outrun it!

222
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,116
[yells]

223
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,625
I think we finally outran it.

224
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,336
Aw, but this is bad.

225
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,879
Now it's too late to go back!

226
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:23,882
Oh, I can't even see
the entrance anymore!

227
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:25,133
[LUFFY]
Then stay here.

228
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:26,801
[USOPP]
I'd die, you idiot!

229
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,136
[SANJI]
More than likely

230
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,262
[yelps]

231
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,099
[screams]

232
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,811
Was that a big snake?

233
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:39,022
[SANJI]
Looked like a giant lamprey.

234
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,024
A "Sky Lamprey" I guess.

235
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:43,610
One that big will do more
than just suck a little blood.

236
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,195
Neatest forest ever, huh?

237
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,696
Neat forest my butt!

238
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,407
If this is our so-called
ordeal, then I quit!

239
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,951
You can't quit yet.
We just got here.

240
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,787
We've got to keep moving.

241
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,290
We can't spend any more time on
this Milky Road than necessary.

242
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,543
Otherwise, we're asking
for certain death.

243
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:21,314
[ALL gasp]

244
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:30,031
What happened to him? No.

245
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,584
There he is!

246
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:42,502
Zoro!

247
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:43,628
[CHOPPER]
It's all my fault!

248
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:45,839
What if he gets swallowed?

249
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:00,478
Wait. Why hasn't
he come back up?

250
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,940
Zoro, please be okay!

251
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,735
You don't think he
got eaten, do you?

252
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:07,610
[CHOPPER screams]

253
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,779
Zoro's fish food!

254
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,949
If he had been eaten, the clouds
would've turned red by now.

255
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,869
How can you stay so
calm at a time like this?

256
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,288
[ZORO]
I am so done with you!

257
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:37,932
[ZORO
I can tell you one thing.

258
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:41,603
We are not gonna make
it across by swimming.

259
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:43,730
What kinda swordsman
punches a shark

260
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:44,856
'stead of usin' his blade?

261
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,524
I'm so glad you're okay!

262
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:49,652
Whatever happened to your
precious swordsman's pride, huh?

263
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:52,113
Would you give it
a rest for once?!

264
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,494
[CHOPPER] Ah! There's an
entire school of 'em!

265
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,287
What are we gonna do?

266
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,538
[ZORO]
I'm not sure.

267
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,457
But if that first one
was any indication,

268
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,959
we're not gonna have much
luck fightin' 'em off.

269
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,544
[ROBIN]
We've got to do something.

270
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,546
We can't stay here forever.

271
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,884
If leaving us here was that
lobster's idea of a joke,

272
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,011
it's not very funny.

273
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,888
Perhaps this is the
"Heaven's Judgment"

274
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,932
we've been hearing
so much about.

275
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,850
[ZORO] 'Cept you'd think this
"God" would try something

276
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:22,268
a little flashier, ya know?

277
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:26,398
Eh. Couldn't say,
never met the guy.

278
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,608
[ZORO] I'm not sure
what the solution is.

279
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,986
We definitely can't set sail
with the hull looking like this.

280
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,656
Hey, Chopper, try to figure
out a way to fix the ship.

281
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:36,783
Uh, me? Okay!

282
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:39,911
Why should he fix it?
Are you going somewhere?

283
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:42,247
[ZORO] I'm gonna find
a way into the forest.

284
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,958
We should probably make
this our base of operations.

285
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,334
You guys can keep a lookout.

286
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,629
I'm sure Luffy and the others
are headed this way.

287
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,214
Like they say,
if you get lost,

288
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:53,049
you should stay
where you are, right?

289
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,468
[NAMI] Shouldn't that
apply to you, too?

290
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,722
[ROBIN]
Hm.

291
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:08,064
Zoro, if you wanna
go into the forest,

292
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,733
well, I guess that's
okay with me.

293
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,943
But you haven't really
told us what for.

294
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,279
There's supposed to be some
kinda God on this island--

295
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:15,363
I wanna meet him.

296
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,574
Wait. That's a terrible idea!

297
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,869
I mean, what are you gonna do
when you actually find him?

298
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:24,247
I don't know. Depends on
if he behaves himself.

299
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,334
Zoro, you're the
bravest person I know.

300
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,919
And what about his priests,
you gonna beat them up, too?

301
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:32,881
Hello? The last thing we need
is you pissing off a God!

302
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,841
It's kinda not smart!

303
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,427
[gasps]

304
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,513
By the time I'm done with him...

305
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,849
...this "God" is gonna
bow before me.

306
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:46,895
Ah-ha! Go, Zoro!

307
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,688
I don't believe in him anyway.

308
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,482
What do I care about
pissing him off?

309
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:51,816
[CHOPPER screams]

310
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,027
O powerful one,
I just wanted you to know

311
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,279
I don't agree with
my idiot shipmate.

312
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:58,031
I don't even like him that much.

313
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,449
Okay, bye.

314
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:02,786
[CHOPPER] Don't listen to
her, Zoro! You're awesome!

315
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:05,830
[ROBIN]
Hm?

316
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,670
Come on. Can't this little
cruise be over already?

317
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,589
Are you kidding? That was
probably a warm up for later.

318
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,383
Supposedly we're gonna
have to go up against

319
00:16:16,466 --> 00:16:18,385
a boat-load of
super-deadly priests

320
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:20,011
that are already waiting
for us on the island.

321
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,013
So you're telling me none
of what we've gone through

322
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:24,641
has anything to do with
our actual ordeal?

323
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,101
I dunno. I kinda doubt it.

324
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,687
Especially considering the
magnitude of that attack

325
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,188
back at the docks.

326
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,399
I couldn't tell you
how it all works,

327
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,025
but it's serious power.

328
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,946
Take even one hit
and you're a goner.

329
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:41,282
This "Eneru" shouldn't be
taken lightly, that's for sure.

330
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,953
And I get the distinct feeling
he's watching us, even now.

331
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,622
[LUFFY] That's weird. So you
think he was in that town?

332
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,040
[SANJI] I'm guessing
he's must have been,

333
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,001
to attack as
accurately as he did.

334
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:54,004
[USOPP] Not necessarily! This
is a God we're talking about.

335
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,464
I bet he could see us from
a thousand miles away!

336
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,134
Heck, he's probably
watching us right now.

337
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:02,554
Yeah? Since when did you become
such a devoted follower?

338
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,472
You're not even
from around here.

339
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,391
You're missing the
point completely.

340
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:08,309
People say "God
is great," right?

341
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,146
I was taught to show
respect to those with power.

342
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,857
You don't have to mean it.
It's self-preservation.

343
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,983
Fine.

344
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,860
But you do realize
that not every "God"

345
00:17:16,943 --> 00:17:18,903
in the world is "great."

346
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:23,116
Like the God of poverty.
Or the God of pestilence.

347
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,285
[USOPP, LUFFY]
Oh, what do you know?

348
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:27,454
[SANJI] We can continue
that debate later.

349
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:30,290
That is, if we live through
being eaten by that thing.

350
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,167
[USOPP whimpers]

351
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,668
[screams]

352
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,712
Not another one!

353
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:41,718
That vine looks pretty sturdy.

354
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,596
[ROBIN]
Ah. Excellent idea.

355
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,890
Mind if I tag along, swordsman?

356
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,976
[ZORO] Sure. Long as you
promise not to slow me down.

357
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,063
[NAMI] Wait a minute!
Where do you think you're going?

358
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,482
Look at this.

359
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,275
At least a thousand
years have passed

360
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,110
since this altar was built.

361
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,237
[NAMI, CHOPPER]
A thousand years?

362
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,823
The sense of history
here is amazing.

363
00:18:03,907 --> 00:18:07,285
It gives me chills. You feel it?

364
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,245
[BOTH]
Uhh...

365
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,623
[ROBIN] A place as ancient
as this is sure to be filled

366
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:14,959
with all kinds of old relics.

367
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,462
Imagine all the valuables
we could discover.

368
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,714
Just think: The
possibilities are endless.

369
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,965
[NAMI]
Hm.

370
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:22,425
In that case, I'll join you.

371
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:25,428
Nami! I thought you
were too scared!

372
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:27,764
It's for history.

373
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,683
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, sure it is.

374
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,063
[ROBIN]
That work for ya?

375
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,690
[ZORO]
It's perfect!

376
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,403
[clearing throat]

377
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,821
[NAMI groans]

378
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:49,661
[ZORO yelling]

379
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:53,289
It's official.
He's lost his mind.

380
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:04,801
She made it!

381
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:06,553
[NAMI]
Looks easy enough.

382
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,684
This is higher up
than I thought.

383
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,977
[ROBIN]
Be careful.

384
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,271
If you fall, you'll
most certainly die.

385
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,024
[NAMI] That supposed to
be your idea of helping?!

386
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,738
Whoa. She's right.

387
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:26,948
I'm dead if I fall.

388
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,742
Nami?

389
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:32,370
All right, fine! I'm going!
Is that what you want?

390
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:36,332
[squeals]

391
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,755
Help me! It's too fast!
I'm gonna crash!

392
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,924
[NAMI screams]

393
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,344
Look at that,
you're not gutless.

394
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,514
[NAMI]
Thanks for catching me.

395
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:52,515
Anytime.

396
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,517
[ZORO yells]

397
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,769
[ZORO]
...is what you should've done.

398
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:57,979
[NAMI]
That had nothing to do with it!

399
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,859
[ROBIN] This forest is even
bigger than I thought.

400
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,072
Okay, Chopper! You're
in charge of the ship!

401
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:08,323
[ROBIN]
We're counting on you!

402
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,991
We'll be back soon!

403
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,660
[CHOPPER]
Bye! Everyone be careful!

404
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,038
Don't take too long, okay?

405
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:21,503
I guess Nami will be all right
since she's with Robin and Zoro.

406
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:25,131
My friends are all so
brave and adventurous.

407
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,884
I'm too scared to go,
but maybe someday,

408
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:32,097
if I'm really lucky,
I can be brave like them, too.

409
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:37,769
[CHOPPER]
Oh, well. If I can't be brave,

410
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,480
I can at least
make myself useful.

411
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:42,774
Being left alone in the middle
of a dangerous forest

412
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:45,151
to fix our ship is proof that
everyone must trust me,

413
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,987
so I have to do my very best.

414
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:51,825
It's just little old me, all by
myself in the big scary forest.

415
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:52,951
[gasps]

416
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,419
[CHOPPER]
Oh, no! Who's gonna protect me?

417
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,005
[screaming]

418
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:06,923
Sky lamprey!

419
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,758
Hey. What do you think?

420
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,094
Would that thing taste good
with some salt and pepper?

421
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,554
Never thought I'd say it,

422
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,723
but I don't think now's the
time for trading recipes.

423
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:15,765
Damn.

424
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,475
Then Gum-Gum...

425
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,060
...Pistol!

426
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,316
[yelling]

427
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:32,699
[USOPP] I hate sky islands,
they're scary!

428
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:34,075
[SANJI]
Wanna get out here?

429
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,161
What kinda question is that?!
You want me to die?!

430
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,538
I'm allowed to be scared,
cut me some slack!

431
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:39,497
[LUFFY chuckles]

432
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,041
Uh. Hey, look!

433
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,960
There's a giant head
blocking our way!

434
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,589
Not quite. It's a statue.

435
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:50,925
Oh, right. But it looks
like a total dead end.

436
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,553
No, look, there's
four entrances.

437
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,222
Of course.

438
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,766
And how much you wanna
bet all four of 'em

439
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,101
lead to different places?

440
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,188
[USOPP]
Ordeal of Swamp, Ordeal of Iron,

441
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,983
Ordeal of String,
and Ordeal of Spheres.

442
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,611
Ha-ha! You think we
get to take our pick?

443
00:22:09,694 --> 00:22:11,321
Is it me, or do none
of these things

444
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:14,366
really sound like much
of an "ordeal"?

445
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,203
[LUFFY chuckles]

446
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,747
[USOPP]
Uh. I don't know, guys.

447
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,791
Which one should we choose?

448
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:38,932
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

449
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

450
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,316
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

451
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

452
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,948
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

453
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

454
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,915
<i>We will never yield</i>

455
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>We won't back down</i>

456
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,087
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

457
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,593
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

458
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,055
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

459
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,475
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

460
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:30,358
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

461
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:43,163
[USOPP]
So, any suggestions?

462
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:45,081
[LUFFY]
Spheres are like balls, right?

463
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:46,124
That sounds fun!

464
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,209
[USOPP]
This isn't a game, you know!

465
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,087
[SANJI] Okay, Spheres it is.
Just don't let your guard down.

466
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,380
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Whoa!

467
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,673
[SANJI]
What is this place?

468
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:54,674
[LUFFY]
Look at all the balls!

469
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:57,093
[USOPP]
You call this an ordeal?

470
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:58,928
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

471
00:23:59,012 --> 00:24:02,724
"10% Survival Rate!
Satori, the Mantra Master!"

472
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,268
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
