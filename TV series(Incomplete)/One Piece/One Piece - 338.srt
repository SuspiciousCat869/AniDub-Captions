00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,691
that your portion
is a bit large--

179
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
would you be interested
in switching with me?

180
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,962
You can have seconds,
just leave her alone!

181
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:45,466
We pulled the
octopus from a fish tank

182
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:46,300
we have on the ship.

183
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,502
It's really big,
you've gotta see it!

184
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:50,838
You have a fish tank with
octopus on your ship?

185
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,774
Truly the wonders never cease
with you people! How splendid!

186
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:54,742
And that's just the start!

187
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,978
Did you know the ship
can transform, too?

188
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:58,813
It can fly in the air and stuff!

189
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,481
I've never heard
of anything like it!

190
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:03,050
How fortunate that I met
with such a fascinating ship!

191
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,753
If you're that interested,
I could show you.

192
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:08,789
Oh, yes, by all means,
right after dinner!

193
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:10,825
He can understand
that nonsense?

194
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:13,928
[BROOK] Gonna see the ship yeah,
gonna see the ship, uh-huh!

195
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,888
Would you
shut up and eat?

196
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,993
[NAMI] The Revive-Revive Fruit?

197
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,863
[FRANKY] So it was a
Devil Fruit after all.

198
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,065
It's a complicated tale.

199
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,466
The truth of the matter is,

200
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,503
I actually did die already,
many years ago.

201
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,804
[SANJI] Could you clean
off your damn face?

202
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,073
I've never seen
such a messy eater.

203
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,710
The Revive-Revive Fruit...

204
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,078
[slurping]

205
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,115
...allows a person to be
reanimated after they have died.

206
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,784
[slurping]

207
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,152
Even among
devil fruit powers,

208
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,221
the ability to live two lives
is indeed quite strange.

209
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,790
So you're a "revive man"!

210
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:51,857
Then you're not immortal.

211
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,792
It's more like you died once

212
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,027
and it gave you a
second chance at life.

213
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,662
[BROOK] In short, yes.

214
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,030
Ah, excuse me.

215
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,098
[burps]

216
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,801
[BROOK] As I said, it's
complicated, but during my

217
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:05,037
"first life" if you will,
I was a pirate, just like you.

218
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,238
[LUFFY] That explains the ship!

219
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,208
[BROOK] That it does.
Excuse me again.

220
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,076
[farts]

221
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,811
I'm gonna beat
some manners into you

222
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,880
if I have to break every
single one of your bones.

223
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,652
[BROOK] A long time ago,
I was sailing

224
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,955
with the rest of my crew
through these accursed waters.

225
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,023
Now, for the record,

226
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,493
I had flesh and blood like
anyone else back then.

227
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,895
At any rate,
we had the misfortune

228
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,633
of running afoul of a
very powerful adversary.

229
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,137
[BROOK] Soon, the entire
crew met its demise.

230
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,710
Of course, that
included me as well.

231
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,179
When I was alive,

232
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,582
the Revive-Revive Fruit
did precious little,

233
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,051
other than rob me
of my ability to swim.

234
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:53,853
But on that fateful day,

235
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,023
its true power awakened
as I lay dead.

236
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,060
[BROOK] My spirit returned
from the netherworld

237
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,865
and came to unite with this
body of mine once again!

238
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,643
[BROOK] Now, if it had actually
found my body as intended,

239
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,578
that would all be well and
good, but as you can see,

240
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,281
the fog around
here is quite thick,

241
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,884
so the matter became
a bit complicated.

242
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:29,221
In short, poor little Soul Brook
couldn't find his way back home.

243
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,323
All in all, my spirit
wandered through

244
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:36,662
the foggy waters, searching
for my body for an entire year.

245
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,764
Then at the end of
its tragic journey,

246
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:42,568
the two were
reunited once again.

247
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,103
Much to my soul's dismay,

248
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,906
by the time it found my
body there was nothing left

249
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,076
but a miserable pile of bones!

250
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,777
I was so shocked,

251
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,979
my eyes were as
wide as dinner plates.

252
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,750
Not that I have eyes to
begin with! Yohohoho!

253
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,718
You got lost, huh?

254
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,787
So you're stupid, just
like Zoro! Hahahaha!

255
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,788
Hey now...

256
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,825
And so a walking,
talking skeleton was born.

257
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,728
Man, those Devil Fruit powers
can be pretty scary sometimes.

258
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,762
Even though you're just bones,

259
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,297
it still brought
you back to life.

260
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,632
Yeah, but it only does
it once, despite the fact

261
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,935
that he still can't swim
and he's stuck like this.

262
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,204
It seems kind of like a
crappy deal if you ask me.

263
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,673
Skeletons aren't supposed
to have hair, are they?

264
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,974
Especially not
so much of it.

265
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,776
Is that afro a wig
or somethin'?

266
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,278
No, my roots are
just very strong.

267
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,047
I'll take your
word for it.

268
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,082
Then that means you're not
actually a ghost after all?

269
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,851
You're just a normal
human like us?

270
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,986
Well, normal is a stretch,
I suppose, but--

271
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,887
The important thing

272
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,856
is that you're definitely
not a ghost?

273
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,058
Ohhh! Oh, heavens no,
I hate ghosts!

274
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,228
If I saw one, I'd scream
my lungs out if I had any!

275
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,264
You're a skeleton and
you're afraid of ghosts?

276
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,932
Have you tried looking
in the mirror lately?

277
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,369
Aaaah!! No mirrors! Stop!

278
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,771
[USOPP] Hm? What's wrong?

279
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,106
Hey. Hold up.
What's going on here?

280
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,244
No, why?
Why can't we see you?

281
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,746
Why don't you show
up in the mirror?

282
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,382
Aaaaah!!

283
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,018
[NAMI, CHOPPER, and USOPP]
A vampire!

284
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,722
Are you for real?
That's awesome!

285
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,657
Look at his feet!

286
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,159
He doesn't even have a shadow!

287
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:17,229
[CHOPPER] Aaaah! You're right!
What kind of creature are you?

288
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,935
[slurps]

289
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,370
Don't take a tea break!

290
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,907
You better explain
yourself right away, mister!

291
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,409
I suppose that I should
tell you the rest of the story.

292
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,212
About what happened while
I was drifting in this evil sea,

293
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,981
and the second tragedy
I was forced to face.

294
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,717
What I told you about
becoming a skeleton is true,

295
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,119
but the reason
I don't have a shadow

296
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,988
is a different matter entirely.

297
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,792
To be continued.

298
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,195
How 'bout you tell us now?

299
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,330
[BROOK] My shadow was stolen.

300
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,799
Someone took it from me,
several years ago.

301
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,134
[USOPP] Stolen?

302
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,836
But how?

303
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,237
[ZORO] I guess that's
not any more ridiculous

304
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,841
than a talking skeleton,
but it's still hard to swallow.

305
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,742
Can something like
that really happen?

306
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,811
[BROOK] Yes. I'm afraid it can.

307
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,947
And in addition to
losing my reflection,

308
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,348
having my shadow stolen means

309
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,284
I can no longer exist
in the world of light.

310
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,320
[LUFFY]
But you're still alive, right?

311
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,755
[BROOK] Yes, for now at
least, but only because

312
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,725
I'm able to stay in this
place with no sunlight.

313
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,961
Although, you can
scarcely call it "living."

314
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,029
I am saved by the
grace of the thick fog

315
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,731
surrounding these seas.

316
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,767
[ROBIN] Then what would happen
if you were exposed to sunlight?

317
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,770
If even a ray of
sunlight touched this body,

318
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,373
every inch that it fell upon

319
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:40,462
would be reduced
to naught but ash.

320
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,949
[BROOK] A single step
into the sun,

321
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,016
and in a matter of moments,

322
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,986
every trace of me would
be wiped from this world.

323
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,892
[STRAW HAT CREW]
You'd be killed?

324
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,828
Yes.

325
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:22,805
[panting]

326
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:28,243
[MAN]
Auuuuugh!!

327
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:43,325
Heh... Hahahaha!

328
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,863
[grunts]

329
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:56,071
[screams]

330
00:16:02,144 --> 00:16:04,480
Aaaah!!

331
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,150
[BROOK] I saw someone
with the same curse

332
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:11,153
as me lose his mind and
run into the sunlight.

333
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,122
When at last his
screams went silent,

334
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:15,457
nothing was left
but a pile of dust.

335
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:16,659
It was so frightful,

336
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:20,362
I swear my soul practically
left my body a second time!

337
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,065
And just as the sunlight
does not cast my shadow,

338
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,467
my image cannot be
reflected in a mirror

339
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,670
or captured in a photograph.

340
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,438
You must forgive me
for startling you,

341
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:33,409
but I hope you can understand my
reluctance to share this story.

342
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:34,376
For as you see,

343
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,679
not only have all of
my comrades been slain,

344
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:39,381
I also live in a
world without light.

345
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,017
Well, I hate to say it,
but your life sure does suck.

346
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,553
Even still, right now,
I'm so happy to have it!

347
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,555
A fluffy afro, a big smile--

348
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,357
the cheery gentlemen
skeleton, Brook!

349
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,958
Always a pleasure!

350
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,694
Where does all this
optimism come from?

351
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:55,964
Yohohohoho!!
Yohohohoho!!

352
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,201
Uh, hey. What's wrong?
He's flipping out!

353
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,405
What a wonderful
day this has been!

354
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,574
I met other people!

355
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:07,976
[BROOK] Buried in a heavy fog,

356
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,478
even though I knew
decades had passed,

357
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:12,514
I couldn't tell when one
day ended and another began.

358
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:17,920
[cheering]

359
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,710
[BROOK] Unable to
navigate or steer the ship,

360
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:46,315
my companions long since dead,
I could only drift aimlessly.

361
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,317
And so I waited and waited

362
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,987
as the waves rocked me
back and forth.

363
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,021
You can't even imagine

364
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,258
how lonely I was
all those years.

365
00:17:56,291 --> 00:18:04,099
Not just lonely, but scared,
wanting to die every single day!

366
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,402
Even still, a long life
is a blessing, not a curse.

367
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:09,037
You've made me so happy.

368
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,673
Meeting such wonderful people
gives my life meaning!

369
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,442
Yohohohoho!!

370
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,244
If I had but the
eyes to shed them,

371
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:18,347
I would be crying tears
of happiness right now!

372
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,548
I was happy beyond measure

373
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:20,816
when you asked me
to join your crew

374
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,253
and I sincerely want to thank
you from the bottom of my heart!

375
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,721
[chuckles]

376
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,290
However, I fear that
I must decline your offer.

377
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:29,324
What?

378
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,726
Why would you do that?

379
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,728
As I mentioned to
all of you just now,

380
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,463
my shadow has been
stolen from me,

381
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:37,466
and I am unable to come
in contact with any sunlight.

382
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,700
Lonely though I may be,

383
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,502
for now I am able
to survive thanks

384
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,571
to the thick fog
covering these seas.

385
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,407
However, if I were to go
on a journey with you,

386
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,642
it would only be
a matter of time

387
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,111
before I met my
unfortunate demise.

388
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,280
[BROOK] Therefore,
however unlikely it may be,

389
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,049
I'll wait for the day when
my shadow can be restored--

390
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,819
make no bones about it.

391
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:59,188
I don't want to hear you
make excuses like that!

392
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,622
If you need your
shadow back so bad,

393
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,491
then we'll get it back for you!

394
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,526
You said someone
stole it from you, right?

395
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,396
Who was it?
Where can we find them?

396
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,064
Thank you.

397
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,667
You truly are a kind
person, aren't you?

398
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,171
But for that reason, I'm
afraid that I cannot tell you.

399
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,706
We've only just met, you see,

400
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,541
and I cannot ask you
to throw your life away

401
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,810
attempting something
that's nearly impossible.

402
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,312
[FRANKY] I'm sure
the guy's tough and all,

403
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,547
but gimme a break.
You got nothing to lose.

404
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,449
Least you can do
is tell us his name.

405
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,351
No, it's best that I don't.

406
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,420
Besides, I doubt
I could find him anyway.

407
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,356
Yohohoho...
But I have decided that

408
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,124
when and if I do ever reach him,

409
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,427
I will fight him to the
death for my shadow.

410
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,796
I don't know when
my second life will end,

411
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,732
but I am willing to wait for
him for the rest of my days.

412
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:51,139
[BROOK] But never mind that.

413
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,141
Why don't I play a song for you?

414
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:55,577
[CREW]
Hmm?

415
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:05,487
I am skilled

416
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,755
with a great many
instruments, you know.

417
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,825
When I sailed the seas with my
old crew, I was their musician.

418
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,526
What? Are you serious?

419
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,161
Our crew needs a musician!

420
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,198
Hurry up and join us
already, I'm begging you!

421
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,633
Yohohoho.

422
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,401
I haven't played
music for anyone in years,

423
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,203
but here goes!

424
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:28,610
[shudderin breaths]

425
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,445
Auuuugghh!!

426
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,616
Hey, what's wrong?
You're freaking out!

427
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,287
A g-g-ghost!

428
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:43,926
[CHOPPER] Ah! He's right!
Get out! Go away!

429
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,861
[LUFFY] This is too cool!

430
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:47,496
[ZORO] It's leaving.

431
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,332
[rumbling]

432
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,601
Wha-- Something's
happening to the ship!

433
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:57,306
[BROOK] No, it can't be.
What terrible fortune!

434
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,674
He must have
been watching them.

435
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,443
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

436
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:03,245
[BROOK]
Everyone look to the front!

437
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,747
That noise we heard was
this gate slamming shut.

438
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:09,851
Our passage has
already been blocked off.

439
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,486
That thing is a gate?

440
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,721
It looks like teeth.

441
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:15,290
Like a giant sea monster
is gonna eat us all!

442
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:17,759
What's going on here?

443
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,964
It seems this is the
backside of the gate.

444
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:23,298
That bad?

445
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,534
This is very bad.

446
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:28,904
[BROOK] Come to the
rear of the ship, hurry!

447
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,180
What in the world is that?

448
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:41,917
Did you, by any chance,
pick up a barrel

449
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,853
from the waters
on your way here?

450
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,691
[ZORO] Hey! There's something
floating in the ocean!

451
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,293
[LUFFY] Hey, you're right!

452
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:53,829
Maybe it fell off
a treasure ship!

453
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,431
Okay, let me see.

454
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,771
Fireworks?

455
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,442
Yeah, we did.

456
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:10,245
It was a trap.
You're all in great danger!

457
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:12,247
Simply put, your
ship's been targeted

458
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,682
ever since you came here.

459
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:15,884
You mean there's someone
out there hunting us down?

460
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,085
And by the way,

461
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,322
how'd we run into that gate
when our ship's not moving?

462
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,643
[LUFFY] Where the heck did
that creepy island come from?

463
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,311
[BROOK] This is the ghost island

464
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,514
that wanders
throughout these seas.

465
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,316
They call it "Thriller Bark."

466
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,569
Thriller Bark. I see.

467
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,882
[USOPP] Where did
that skeleton run off to?

468
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:23,351
And hey, let me steer
the paddleboat, Nami!

469
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,052
[NAMI] Not a chance!

470
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,554
You can try it out next time!

471
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:26,922
This is too much fun!

472
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,023
[USOPP] Wait a second,

473
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,692
is it just me or is that
island trying to swallow us?

474
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,929
[NAMI] Oh, you're just trying
to scare me--ah! It is!

475
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,430
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

476
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:38,033
"One Unnatural
Phenomenon After the Next!

477
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,068
Disembarking on Thriller Bark!"

478
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,637
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
