00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,393
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:18,193
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,994
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,180
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,847
[NARRATOR] God Eneru's land,
the Upper Yard.

25
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,016
The deadly survival
game continued,

26
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,728
and the latest round cost
the losers the ultimate price.

27
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:45,572
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Robin
stumbled upon Shandora--

28
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:48,408
the fabled lost city of gold.

29
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:50,452
Chopper found his way
to the Upper Ruins

30
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,454
where he encountered
the Priest Ohm,

31
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,749
and sadly fell to
his Ordeal of Iron.

32
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:03,590
The path to peace
leads to but one place.

33
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:08,053
This is the Ordeal of Iron!
The survival rate is zero!

34
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:11,765
[NAMI screams]

35
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,475
[LUFFY]
Let me out of here!

36
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:14,434
[LUFFY yelling]

00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:16,311
[NAMI screams]

38
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,899
[NARRATOR] Back at the
Upper Ruins of Giant Jack,

39
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,817
Ohm staved off
an attack by Wyper,

40
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,236
the leader of
the Shandorian rebels.

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,822
But before their battle
could rage any further,

42
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:31,826
they were interrupted by two
more of the game's survivors.

43
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:36,331
[ZORO screams]

44
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:40,543
Ow... Bird's gonna pay.

45
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,923
Where am I? More ruins?

46
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,509
These guys all look
pretty tough.

47
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:51,221
Oh, well.
Hey! Hand over the gold!

48
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,181
[OHM]
Look what we have here.

49
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:56,851
If it isn't another greedy
infidel, seeking his salvation.

50
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,812
[WYPER]
Enough! Get out of my way

51
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:01,398
or I'll destroy
every one of you!

52
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,899
[GAN FALL]
The time has come, Ohm.

53
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:06,820
Tell me where Eneru and
the Divine Squad are!

54
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:10,031
Ya stupid cave! Just lemme out!

55
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,616
[SNAKE groans]

56
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,829
[OHM] I'm sure you each feel
what you have to say

57
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,914
is important,
but there's only one way

58
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:19,582
for your voice to be heard.

59
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,752
You must survive...
or find salvation!

60
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,385
[LUFFY]
"Climb Giant Jack!

61
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,471
Deadly Combat in

[SNAKE growls]

63
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:45,358
Now if you're ready, it's
time to bring this to an end.

64
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:49,362
The mighty Eneru has prophesied
that you won't survive.

65
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:50,780
Oh, yeah?

66
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,992
[OHM] If only your hearts hadn't
been tainted by greed,

67
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,952
you might have lived longer.

68
00:04:56,036 --> 00:05:01,249
I'll grant you a few moments to
repent before I render judgment.

69
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,209
[ZORO]
Heh. So I guess that makes you

70
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:06,004
one of those priests
that serves Eneru, huh?

71
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,841
I couldn't care less
about him or his prophesies.

72
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,509
The only thing
preordained for me

73
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:14,637
in this crazy place
is takin' the gold.

74
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:17,390
I will forgive you
of that sin, too.

75
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:18,725
Huh?

76
00:05:18,808 --> 00:05:21,561
[OHM] Your only salvation
lies in a quick death--

77
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:25,648
one that I can mercifully
provide with my Ordeal of Iron.

78
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,318
I'll save all of you.

79
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,905
Hmph!

80
00:05:31,988 --> 00:05:35,158
High and mighty words from
a blaggard such as yourself.

81
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:37,452
[OHM]
Hmph. Let's go, Holy.

82
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,496
Be as ferocious
as you want, Boy.

83
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,705
[barks]

84
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,874
That one is our target, Pierre!

85
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,459
Since he is the most powerful,

86
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,753
we must neutralize
Eneru's priest first!

87
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:48,838
Pi-e!

88
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:54,219
[SNAKE growling]

89
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:58,139
I'm really gettin'
sick of you, snake.

90
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:01,017
I mean, how the hell'd you
get way up here, anyway?

[LUFFY grunting]

92

[LUFFY] Dammit!
One minute this place is up,

93
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,985
the other, it's down!

94
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,907
This is one messed-up cave!

[SNAKE growling]

96
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:21,621
Well I guess the three of you...

00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,123
[ZORO]
Hm?

98
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:26,001

have to die together!

[WYPER]
Huh?

102
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,221
Heh.

103
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:41,016
You need to work
on your aim there, pal!

[WYPER]
Insolent Blue Sea Dweller!

105
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:44,602
You think you can just
come to this land

106
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,312
and take what's rightfully ours?

107
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,898
You have no idea how long
and hard we've struggled!

108
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:51,568
[ZORO] If you Sky People want
to blow each other to pieces,

109
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,778
that's your business.

110
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:58,700
It's like I told that priest,
I couldn't care less!

111
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,452
That figures!

112
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:07,375
[WYPER] I should have finished
you from the start!

00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,088
Damn.

All right, note to self.

Whoa. I've never seen
a dog move like that!

127
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:13,066
Not many people have, friend.

128
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:16,277
You'll find that Holy knows
a great number of commands

129
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:18,446
beyond just "sit" and "stay."

130
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,075
I'm a Skybreeder renowned for
my special animal training.

131

I've trained him how to
walk upright on two legs

132

and to box just like a
champion prizefighter.

Chopper! No!

175
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,865
I'm coming! Hang on!

176
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:12,620
I see. He was part of
your Blue Sea crew.

177
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:17,083
Hey. Watch your step over there.

178
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,128
[groans]

179
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,009
What the--?

180
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,094
Barbed wire?

181
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:33,224
[WYPER]
So that's his ordeal?

182
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:35,727
[ZORO]
Chopper! Talk to me!

183
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,063
Say something! Why?

184
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:41,775
Why did you try and take
this guy on? Come on!

185
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,069
[OHM]
A shame, isn't it?

186
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,491
Those barbs? Iron Cloud.

187
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,118
They're light as a cloud,
but hard as iron.

188
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,746
Blown into shape
by a milky dial.

189
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:56,915
I've rigged several of 'em
with hidden triggers.

190
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:59,000
You and your little friend
found out the hard way

191
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,711
what happens when
you step on one.

192
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:04,673
This field is a weapon.
I don't have to attack you.

193
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:09,094
I can sit back and watch your
own blundering do you in.

194
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:12,013
I'm partially responsible
for that animal's defeat,

195
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,682
but he's also to blame.

196
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:17,560
He stumbled into my
ordeal all by himself.

197
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,527
[OHM] I guess you'll want
to get revenge now, eh?

198
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,987
No.

199
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,489
Believe it or not,

200
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:32,659
I normally don't like fighting
for that reason at all.

201
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:35,954
Oh. Heh. I'm actually impressed.

202
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,872
[ZORO]
Normally.

203
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:43,378
But you've changed my mind.

204
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,532
[PAGAYA] Well, Conis,
I think we've arrived.

205
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,951
This is the seashore
where our Blue Sea friends

206
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,578
are planning to meet, right?

207
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,996
[CONIS]
Yes, Father.

208
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,748
This is where Nami told me
they'd be dropping anchor.

209
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,125
[PAGAYA] Well then,
what should we do now?

210
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,211
I really wasn't expecting
to look after their ship.

211
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:29,341
Nonetheless, we must protect it
at all costs until they return!

212
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,843
I'll sound the horn to
scare off any threats!

213
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,095
Right. Good idea, Father!

214
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,222
Let them hear our resolve!

215
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:41,019
[horn blares]

216
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,937
[PAGAYA]
Ah, perfect.

217
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:48,943
[PAGAYA]
Keep your eyes open, Suu.

218
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,487
I'm counting on you
to keep watch.

219
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,863
[SUU]
Suu!

220
00:13:56,034 --> 00:14:00,497
[horn continues]

221
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,667
[CONIS]
Nami, you mentioned a promise?

222
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,168
[NAMI]
Oh, that.

223
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:07,545
Luffy and the others went
into the forest on an errand,

224
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,923
but we all promised to meet up
on the northwest shore,

225
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,050
so that's why I've got
to go over there.

226
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,468
[CONIS]
Do you think they're okay?

227
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,096
Things are really dangerous
in the forest right now.

228
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,181
I just hope they're all right.

229
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:21,017
[NAMI]
Don't worry.

230
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:24,479
That's my crew we're talkin'
about. They'll be fine.

231
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,693
[horn continues]

232
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,989
Hang on! I'll nurse both
of you back to health!

233
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,325
You'll be better in no time!

234
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,290
[horn continues]

235
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,918
[PAGAYA]
Please everyone, be safe.

236
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:50,130
I'm sorry the sky
island is like this.

237
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:58,138
[SHANDORIANS shouting]

238
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,934
[SHANDORIAN B] Don't stop
until we've taken Eneru's head!

239
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,310
[DIVINE SQUAD A]
The only heads that will roll

240
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,646
are yours, Shandorian!

241
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,524
[SHANDORIAN A]
Climb up Giant Jack!

242
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:12,360
[DIVINE SQUAD A] Don't let
them get to God's Shrine!

243
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:21,327
[LAKI] Wyper! Please don't
use the Reject anymore!

244
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:25,540
Now, Divine Squad!
Let's kill them all!

245
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,584
[DIVINE SQUAD B bleating]

246
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:38,470
[LAKI]
Don't challenge Eneru, Wyper!

247
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:47,854
[LAKI] He can't be defeated.
No matter what we do.

248
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:01,117
[SHANDORIANS groaning]

[laughing]

251
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:12,379
That's right. Those of you
still in the game,

252
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:17,717
climb your way to the Upper
Ruins and destroy each other.

253
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,637
[SNAKE roars]

254
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,890
[ENERU] There will only
be five survivors.

255
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,814
[ENERU] My words and
prophecies are absolute.

[GAN FALL]
Stop this insanity now, Wyper!

260
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:44,369
I'm not here to--

261
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:45,912
You're not what, Old Man?

262
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:49,082
You believe that
you're not my enemy?

263
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,959
To the Shandorians,
there's no difference

264
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,753
between you and Eneru!
Both of you must go!

265
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,089
[GAN FALL] Quit being stubborn!
Listen to reason!

My Burn Bazooka didn't
even faze that thing.

00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,035

What... was that?

282
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:31,685
Hmph. Typical Blue Sea Dweller.
You didn't expect it.

283
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,730
You see This sword of mine
is also made of Iron Cloud.

284
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,691
In other words,

285
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:40,360
the blade itself is actually
Iron Cloud expelled

286
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,571
from a dial that's conveniently
embedded in the sword's hilt,

287
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,117
and it will hunt its prey
to the ends of the earth!

288
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,414
[OHM] Well, do you
understand it better now,

Swordsman from the Blue Sea?

290
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,251
Yeah, it's just like a whip.

291
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,753
I get it. You White
White Sea people

292
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,424
are more circus performers
than warriors!

to fight separately.

Well, you know what this means.

305
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:50,972
Yeah. It means we're
the only ones left.

348
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,634
[ALL gasp]

349
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,599
Wyper!

350
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,811
[OHM]
You were so distracted

351
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:05,190
that you neglected to
protect yourselves.

352
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:08,401
Quit worryin' about
other people!

353
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,906
Accept it! There's nothing
you can do to save them!

354
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:19,996
[NAMI, AISA scream]

355
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,964
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

356
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,551
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

357
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:37,555
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

358
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,142
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

359
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

360
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:48,942
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

361
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:52,028
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

362
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:57,242
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

363
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,286
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

364
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,205
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

365
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

366
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,585
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

367
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,504
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

368
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,257
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

369
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,675
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

370
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,552
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

371
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,389
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

372
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,224
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

373
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:25,061
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

374
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,231
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

375
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:45,040
[ZORO] Fence or no fence,
I'm not running away.

376
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,292
[WYPER] So the thorns
are painful, I get it.

377
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,626
Laki!

378
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,170
[LAKI] Get out of there now,
Wyper! Don't fight!

379
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:52,672
[WYPER]
Stop it, you monster! Laki!

380
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:54,716
[ENERU laughs]
Even though you're a woman,

381
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,259
I'll show you no mercy.

382
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:59,220
[ZORO] Hey, snake! Let's see
what's in that belly of yours!

383
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,972
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

384
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,392
"The Ordeal of Iron!
White Barbed Death Match!"

385
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,103
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
