00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,578
And what is your goal?

174
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,746
To beat you.

175
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,914
[MIHAWK chuckles]

176
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,115
How foolish...

177
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,756
You've got spare time,
so let's do this.

178
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:20,059
Whoa! No way!
It's him! Roronoa Zoro!

179
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,928
It's Zoro of the
Three‐Swords Style!

180
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,262
It is?!

181
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,665
Really? A pirate hunter?

182
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,934
He's a what?!

183
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,972
Hey Luffy, we'd
better hurry! Come on!

184
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,908
The Going Merry is about
to sail right out of sight!

185
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,777
Hey! Luffy!

186
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,245
A fight...

187
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,615
You're a weak, pitiful creature.

188
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,921
[MIHAWK] If you are in fact
a competent swordsman,

189
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,090
you should see the
disparity in our abilities,

190
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,092
even before we cross swords.

191
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,963
I must ask you why have
you challenged me?

192
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:01,033
Could it be your courage?
Or is it simply your ignorance?

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,102
My ambition drives me!

194
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,975
Also... I made a promise
I intend to keep.

195
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,710
The greatest
swordsman in the world

196
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,645
going up against Roronoa Zoro...

197
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,313
Two masters of swordplay...

198
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,183
What kind of a fight is
this gonna turn out to be?

199
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,820
There isn't a person alive
who can defeat Big Bro.

200
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,989
He's already the
best in the world!

201
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:25,992
[ZORO gasps]

202
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,796
Funny... What do you think
you're gonna do with that?

203
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,998
It'll be more than adequate.

204
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,401
After all, you wouldn't kill
a fly with a cannon, would you?

205
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,404
You may have quite the
reputation on the East Blue,

206
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,840
but that doesn't
mean much to me.

207
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,910
This sea is by far
the weakest of the four.

208
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,814
Unfortunately, I don't carry any
blades smaller than this one.

209
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,917
I have had just about
enough of your attitude.

210
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,887
[ZORO]
Now, you die!

211
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,923
You have no idea how
big the world really is.

212
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,026
[ZORO]
Oni Giri!

213
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,928
[metal clangs]

214
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,997
[ZORO gasps]
What the‐‐?!

215
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:13,906
Zoro!

216
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,876
What?! Big Bro's
Oni Giri was stopped?!

217
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,780
But that's crazy! That attack
never fails to stop an enemy!

218
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,782
What's going on here?!

219
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,719
[ZORO] I can't move my swords!
What has he done?!

220
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,255
No one's been able to defend
against that technique...

221
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,724
He stopped it with
a pocketknife!

222
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,027
No... Th‐This
can't be happening!

223
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,463
He can't be this much
better than me!

224
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,733
There's no way our skills
are this far apart!

225
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,771
[ZORO yells] I'm not that far
behind the world's strongest!

226
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,074
[ZORO grunting]

227
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,042
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY whimpering]

228
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,243
[ZORO groans]

229
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,445
[ZORO grunts]

230
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,713
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY gasp]

231
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,148
You're just toying with him,
right?! Fight for real, Big Bro!

232
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,883
Big Bro!

233
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,086
You can't be that
much better than me!

234
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,957
[ZORO yells]

235
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,745
[ZORO grunting]

236
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,652
Such ferocious swordplay.

237
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,854
[ZORO yells]

238
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,694
[PIRATE SS]
How can he defend against

239
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,463
Zoro's Three‐Sword Style
with such a small knife?!

240
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,332
[PIRATE VV] He's more
of monster with a blade

241
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,867
than even the great Zoro!

242
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,940
[ZORO] I did not devote my
entire life to swordsmanship...

243
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,676
to be dispatched
by a toy like this!

244
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,947
‐‐[KUINA] Zoro...
‐‐[ZORO gasps]

245
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,718
[ZORO groans]

246
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,654
[ZORO grunts]

247
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,689
[ZORO screams]

248
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,825
[KUINA grunts]

249
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,362
You're lucky, Zoro...
being born as a man.

250
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,899
All I ever wanted was to be
the world's greatest swordsman.

251
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,569
If only... If I'd
just been born a man!

252
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,237
[ZORO growls]

253
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,505
[ZORO]
Don't fly off at the mouth,

254
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,541
whining like that
after you beat me!

255
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,642
Because it's not fair!

256
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,545
You're my goal! Do you know
how this makes me feel?!

257
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,579
[KUINA gasps]

258
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,814
[KUINA]
Zoro...

259
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,749
Now promise me...

260
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,851
Promise me that someday,
one of us will be

261
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:41,420
the world's greatest swordsman.

262
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,855
We'll see who gets there.

263
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,257
[BOTH]
It's a promise.

264
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,932
[ZORO]
To become the world's strongest!

265
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,536
[ZORO growling]

266
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,341
[ZORO grunting]

267
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,577
[ZORO] I ask that you
let me have that sword.

268
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,612
I'm gonna get stronger
than she ever was!

269
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,782
Strong enough that my name
reaches up to the heavens!

270
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,686
I am going to be the
world's greatest swordsman!

271
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,622
I promised her... I promised...

272
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,298
[ZORO grunting, panting]

273
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,468
[ZORO] I will defeat
this man... for her!

274
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,939
[ZORO grunting]

275
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,310
[ZORO pants]

276
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,712
[ZORO grunts]

277
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,980
What is it then?

278
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,749
What weight do you carry
upon your shoulders?

279
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,618
Speak up, weakling!

280
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,486
How dare you call
him "weakling"!

281
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,787
You'll pay for that!

282
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,389
We'll teach you a lesson!

283
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,323
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY yell]

284
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:51,991
[LUFFY]
No!

285
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,660
Yosaku! Johnny! Get back here!

286
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,465
‐‐Just stay put!
‐‐[YOSAKU, JOHNNY growling]

287
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,833
Luffy...

288
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,003
[ZORO grunts]
No... I won't lose...

289
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,071
I refuse to be defeated!

290
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,846
[heartbeat thumps]

291
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,187
Tiger...

292
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,923
[LUFFY]
World's greatest swordsman...

293
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,025
Sounds pretty good!
The King of the Pirates

294
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,494
wouldn't have any less
than the best on his crew.

295
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,628
[ZORO]
...Trap!

296
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,719
You are defeated, yet
you won't step back...

297
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,954
Why not?

298
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,122
[ZORO]
I don't know...

299
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,025
But... I will not run...

300
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,494
Even if I retreat
a single step...

301
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,130
I would be shattering
the promises I've made.

302
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,799
I can't run...

303
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,701
I would lose my honor.

304
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,069
You see, without that,

305
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,738
there would be nothing
left for me here.

306
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,841
That's what defeat is.

307
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,744
[ZORO chuckles]
Then I won't accept defeat.

308
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,413
Then you'll die.

309
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,516
I'd rather die than give up!

310
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,753
[MIHAWK]
A strong heart indeed!

311
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,155
He chooses death before defeat!

312
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,390
[ZORO grunts]

313
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,561
Sir... State your name!

314
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,501
I am... Roronoa Zoro!

315
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,736
[MIHAWK]
I'll remember it!

316
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,106
No one as strong as you has
come around in quite some time.

317
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,609
So as a swordsman's courtesy,

318
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,546
I'll use the world's strongest
black sword to finish you.

319
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,749
Thank you... I appreciate it.

320
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,451
[PIRATE A]
Look! He took it out!

321
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,454
[PIRATE B] That's the sword
that sliced up the ship!

322
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,956
[ZORO]
So this is it...

323
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,025
Will it be the
world's strongest...

324
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,126
...or death?

325
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,864
[LUFFY growls]

326
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,632
Enough, Big Bro!
Stop it! Please!

327
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,068
[ZORO] Three‐Sword
Style Secret Technique!

328
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:19,872
[MIHAWK]
Fall!

329
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,874
[ZORO]
Three Thousand Worlds!

330
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,084
[ZORO]
I've lost...

331
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,622
[ZORO] Never in my life
did I imagine I'd lose.

332
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,727
[ZORO] So this is the power
of the greatest in the world.

333
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,499
But why...?

334
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,837
Scars on the back are
a swordsman's shame.

335
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:52,838
Fine.

336
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:02,081
Zoro!

337
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,252
[MIHAWK] You shouldn't rush
these things, young man.

338
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,855
[USOPP]
Zoro!

339
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,191
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY]
Big Bro!

340
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,694
No!

341
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,829
[SANJI]
Why?!

342
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,199
[ZORO]
I devoted my entire life to

343
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,534
becoming the world's
greatest swordsman...

344
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,535
It was my choice,

345
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,871
so I'm the only one who
gets to call me stupid.

346
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,174
[SANJI]
He's insane!

347
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,810
His opponent was way
out of his league!

348
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,146
How this fight would end
was clear from the start!

349
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,814
Why choose death?!

350
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,282
Don't be stupid!

351
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,852
Give up your ambition and live!

352
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:47,059
So this is the power of the
Grand Line; it's terrifying!

353
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,729
The Pirate Hunter Zoro was as
helpless as a newborn baby!

354
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,064
[LUFFY]
Damn you...

355
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,868
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY]
Big bro!

356
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:01,740
[LUFFY yells]

357
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,976
He must be some kind of freak!

358
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,244
[SANJI gasps]

359
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,747
So that loudmouthed little twerp
has the power of a Devil Fruit.

360
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,849
[LUFFY]
Bastard!

361
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,587
[MIHAWK] Are you that
young warrior's comrade?

362
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,990
I'm impressed with you
for not interfering.

363
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,262
[LUFFY grunts]

364
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,597
[MIHAWK] There's nothing
to be upset about.

365
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,166
Your friend will live.

366
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,033
[LUFFY]
Huh?

367
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,602
[YOSAKU]
Big Bro! Say something, please!

368
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,871
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

369
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,605
[ZORO groans]

370
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,706
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

371
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,942
C'mon let's hurry up and
get him out of the water.

372
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,612
[USOPP]
I've got some medicine! Here!

373
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
It's still far too
early for you to die.

374
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,618
My name is Hawk‐Eye Mihawk!

375
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,688
You're strong but there
is much for you to learn.

376
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,791
No matter how many years it
takes, I will hold this title as

377
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,394
the greatest in the world,
and wait for you!

378
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,730
Until that day, you
must hone your skills!

379
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,267
Then... seek me out!
Roronoa Zoro!

380
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,870
[YOSAKU]
Please say something!

381
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,071
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY]
Anything!

382
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,076
Not just anyone can earn
the regard of Hawk‐Eye Mihawk.

383
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,212
[MIHAWK]
You...

384
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,047
What is your goal?

385
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,982
To be the King!

386
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,751
Your ambitions are even
loftier than your friend's.

387
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,153
That's quite a task.

388
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,889
Yeah, well, you just let
me worry about that.

389
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,057
Bleh!

390
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,892
[USOPP]
He's alive!

391
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,393
He was just unconscious!

392
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,261
Big Bro!

393
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,730
If you're alive,
then say something!

394
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,899
[gasps] Zoro!

395
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,000
[YOSAKU]
Big Bro!

396
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,403
[ZORO]
Luffy...

397
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,938
Can you hear me...?

398
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,973
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

399
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,244
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

400
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,912
I know that you need
nothing less than

401
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,348
the greatest swordsman
in the world...

402
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,416
I've let you down...

403
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,918
Please forgive me.

404
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,756
Okay, okay! You can
stop saying things now!

405
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,991
Big Bro!

406
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,260
[ZORO]
I solemnly swear...

407
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,095
From this moment forward...

408
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,764
That I will never lose again!

409
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,166
[ZORO chokes]

410
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,868
Until the day comes...

411
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,772
...when I defeat him
and take his title...

412
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,840
I will never...

413
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,842
...never be defeated!

414
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,111
Is that okay...

415
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,280
...King of the Pirates?!

416
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,718
[LUFFY laughs]
Yup!

417
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,454
You're a good team.

418
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,657
I hope to see you
again... someday.

419
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,029
[KRIEG]
Hey! Hawk‐Eye!

420
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,498
I was under the impression that

421
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,300
you had come here
to take my life.

422
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,470
Weren't you here to kill Don
Krieg, ruler of the East Blue?

423
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,372
The thought had
crossed my mind...

424
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,141
But I've had enough
fun for today,

425
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,243
so I'm going home
to get some rest.

426
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,045
[bones cracking]

427
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,546
I don't care if
you've had enough.

428
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,581
I haven't even gotten started.

429
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
Um, but, sir...

430
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,519
Maybe it's not a good idea
to try to keep him here!

431
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,221
[KRIEG chuckles]

432
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,325
Now it's time to die!

433
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,560

He just won't learn, will he?

[PIRATES screaming]

435
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:19,171
Aw, damn... He escaped.

Go on ahead!

441
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,185
I'll leave Nami to you!

442
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:33,885
[USOPP]
Roger that!

443
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,354
Don't you worry about a thing!

444
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,255
Zoro and I are gonna
get her right back!

445
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,925
And make sure you get that
cook to join our crew!

446
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,059
And then...

447
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,261
...on the Going Merry,
the five of us'll set sail...

448
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,030
...to the Grand Line!

Yeah! Let's do it!

[KRIEG]
All right, men!

451
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,969
We ran into a little
distraction from our plan,

452
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,904
but the real fight starts now!

453
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,373
We're gonna take that ship!

454

Yes, sir!

Hey, Pops,

00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,112
can I stop doing these chores if
I get those pirates outta here?
