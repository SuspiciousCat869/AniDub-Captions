00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,583
You two are fighting
again, already?!

177
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,051
[MR. 0] We will have
no more radio contact

178
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,287
from now on, understand?

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,422
If Marines were to catch on
to what we're doing,

180
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,057
that would be most unfortunate.

181
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,760
From this point on, all of my
orders will be sent via letter,

182
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,997
following the usual protocol.
That will be all, Mr. 3...

183
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,966
Good luck on your mission.

184
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,278
[MR. 0]
Miss All Sunday.

185
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,012
Yes, sir?

186
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,781
[MR. 0]
I want you to send Mr. 2

187
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,783
to Little Garden immediately.

188
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,850
Huh?

189
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,287
Mr. 3 is on his way from
Little Garden to Alabasta.

190
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,290
I want you to see
that he is eliminated...

191
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,962
Perhaps that might be...
a little extreme, Crocodile.

192
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,497
[MR. 0] We still have plenty
of agents to spare.

193
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you arguing with me,
Miss All Sunday?

194
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,368
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
No...

195
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,604
I'll make the
arrangements at once.

196
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,372
Consider it done.

197
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,376
[MR. 0]
Hmm...

198
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,386
Well, he finally hung up...

199
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,989
Now... I wonder
who these guys were...

200
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,024
They sure are funny looking.

201
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,400
What's this?

202
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,684
[BROGGY]
Gya, ba, ba, ba, ba!

203
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:56,922
Gya, ba, ba, ba, ba!
Gya, ba, ba, ba, ba!

204
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,092
Gya, gya, gya, gya!

205
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,728
We've been fighting so long
that we'd completely forgotten

206
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,830
about the bounties
that were put on our heads.

207
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,899
It has been a long time.

208
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,668
But I'm the whole reason
that the Baroque Works agents

209
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,403
came here in the first place...

210
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,671
It's my fault.

211
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,073
None of that anymore... Okay...?

212
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:14,940
Yeah, come on, Vivi.

213
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,576
Why are you so sad?

214
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,678
Here, have a rice cracker.

215
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,113
[NAMI] Uh, guys,
where did you get those?

216
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,916
[LUFFY] I know!
Let's have a rice cracker party!

217
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,951
Rice crackers aren't
that exciting, though.

218
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,020
[LUFFY] Sure they are!
We can even toast with them.

219
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,456
You see...?
Nobody's blaming you.

220
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,091
[LUFFY]
Cheers!

221
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,695
[USOPP]
Hey, Luffy, don't do that!

222
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,463
You can't just go
wasting food like that.

223
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,098
Seriously,
you should know better.

224
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,866
[LUFFY]
Hey, what are you doing?!

225
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,902
Who said you could
have my cracker?

226
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:43,703
Give it here!

227
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,538
[USOPP]
It's done! It's mine now!

228
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,639
[LUFFY]
No, it's not!

229
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,473
What's with you?

230
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,142
[NAMI]
Nothing... Just a bug bite.

231
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,645
All right, I still can't believe
we have to wait here a year

232
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,613
just for the Log Pose to reset.

233
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,781
I know...

234
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,950
It's definitely something
we should be worried about!

235
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,119
All of you helped save us
from those other guys.

236
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,923
If we can, we would really
like to return the favor.

237
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,158
Well, maybe you guys could do
something about our Log Pose,

238
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,827
so we won't be stuck here.

239
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,128
Huh...

240
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,464
I'm afraid the Log Pose
is the one thing

241
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,798
that we can't help you with.

242
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,833
[SANJI]
Ahhh!

243
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,004
Nami, dear! Vivi, my love!
And all the rest of you!

244
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,141
Hey...! Sanji!

245
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:26,178
You're all still okay...!
I'm so happy, so happy!

246
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,481
Of course, he's happy,
the big useless jerk...!

247
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,950
He shows up after we've
taken care of everything!

248
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,485
[laughs]

249
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,686
[shrieks]

250
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,588
[SANJI]
What the hell is going on?!

251
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,690
Is one of you guys Mr. 3?

252
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,026
Wait... and just how do you
know about Mr. 3 anyway?

253
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,995
Nami...

254
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,531
You look absolutely
amazing in that outfit!

255
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,866
[NAMI]
Say that again.

256
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,134
[SANJI]
Now, Nami...

257
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,604
If you stand around dressed like
that all day, you'll catch cold.

258
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,038
Here... Take my coat...

259
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,640
Oh, thank you...

260
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,941
[SANJI]
So, I've been a little busy.

261
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:56,876
I just finished talking

262
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,646
to that Mr. 0 guy over
a transponder snail.

263
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,148
Mr. 0?!

264
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,149
[SANJI]
Yeah, that guy...

265
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,217
I was talking to him in
this weird hideout place

266
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,952
I found in the jungle.

267
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,054
He thought I was
some guy called Mr. 3,

268
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,891
and I thought it would be a
good idea to let him believe it.

269
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,225
And since I had him on the line,

270
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,728
I went ahead and told him
that we were all dead.

271
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,029
[gasps]

272
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,064
So he thinks he doesn't have to
send people after us anymore.

273
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,299
So you're saying
that we're finally free

274
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,569
of people chasing us now that
we can't go anywhere anyway?

275
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,037
Oh... That is just perfect...

276
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,205
We can't go? Why?

277
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,074
Is there still something we
need to take care of here?

278
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,709
That's a real shame
after I managed

279
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,912
to get hold of this thing.

280
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,820
Uh... what...?

281
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,156
An Eternal Pose to
Alabasta...! All right!

282
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,259
Now, we can set sail! Woo‐hoo!

283
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,761
[NAMI]
Yes! Good job!

284
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,763
I knew something would happen!

285
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,199
Ohh...! Thank you!
Thank you so much!

286
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,099
Thank you, Sanji!

287
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,735
I was getting really
worried, thank you!

288
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,605
No, no!
It was all my pleasure.

289
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,907
I'm just glad I could
make you happy, Vivi.

290
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,008
[LUFFY]
All right, everyone!

291
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,277
Now we're having
a rice cracker party!

292
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,279
No way. Look, Luffy,

293
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,615
we don't have
enough left for a party.

294
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,783
There's only three.

295
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,951
[LUFFY]
What?!

296
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,785
It doesn't matter.

297
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,720
We don't have time
for that anyway.

298
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,621
Come on now, Captain.

299
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,224
We don't have time
to be sitting here.

300
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,061
Zoro! Hold on a sec.

301
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,598
So, uh, you forget
about our hunting contest?

302
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,234
[ZORO] Nope. Hate to
tell you this, but you lost.

303
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,636
I caught a rhino
that was this big.

304
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,073
That doesn't sound very tasty,
but I guess you can eat it.

305
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,975
Sounds just fine to me.

306
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,810
[BROGGY]
Hunting contest?

307
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,578
[DORRY]
Hunting contest?

308
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,581
Something about that
sounds familiar somehow.

309
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,650
[DORRY]
Hmm...

310
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,319
'Kay... Giant old guys,

311
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,089
it's really been
a lot of fun, but we gotta go.

312
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:50,990
[BROGGY]
Hm?

313
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,991
[DORRY]
Hmm?

314
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,726
Of course... Right...

315
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,294
We can tell you
need to get going.

316
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,963
It's too bad that you
have to leave so soon.

317
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,932
I hope you get to
your homeland in time.

318
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,001
Me too. Thank you.

319
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,137
[LUFFY] See ya...!
Try not to die anymore, okay?

320
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,238
Quaaaack!

321
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,072
Master...

322
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,341
I'm going to go
visit Elbaf someday!

323
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,776
You just wait and see.

324
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,945
My catch is much
bigger than yours.

325
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,680
[ZORO]
Hmph! You wish.

326
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,822
Our friends are setting sail.

327
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,625
That's right, and
we can't just sit here,

328
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,662
not when there's a monster
waiting for them in the sea.

329
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,165
So, Dorry,
how are your wounds doing?

330
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,835
These...? I think
I can live with them.

331
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,875
It's safe to say that our
weapons are about worn through.

332
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,345
Any regrets?

333
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,546
[BROGGY]
It's difficult to give up...

334
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,883
I've fought with this axe for
more than a hundred years,

335
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,220
but if it's a sacrifice for our
friends, then it's worth it.

336
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,022
Yeah, I agree...

337
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,734
[ZORO] See, I told you mine
was bigger than yours.

338
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,835
I win!

339
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,371
You should look closer!
My lizard is much bigger!

340
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,039
[ZORO] What, are you
blind or something...?

341
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,241
My rhino is obviously
so much larger

342
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,810
than your stupid lizard is.

343
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,144
It doesn't really matter...

344
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,412
They both look yummy.

345
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,081
[ZORO, SANJI]
Just shut up, Luffy!

346
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,182
[ZORO]
Yours doesn't even have horns...

347
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,817
[SANJI] What does that
have to do with anything...?

348
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,418
[ZORO]
Size! Yours is puny...

349
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,722
Children, how long
are you going to fight...?

350
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,990
We don't need all of it, anyway,

351
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,026
just cut up what we do need, so
we can get out of here, already.

352
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,395
Right...! Of course, Nami!

353
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,832
Hey, Usopp! Would you tell him
that I'm clearly the winner?

354
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,333
No, I really don't care.

355
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,268
Can't you just agree it's a tie?

356
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,403
I don't believe in ties.

357
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,371
I fight to win.

358
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,072
Just hurry up, you two!

359
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,774
[shuddering]

360
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,109
[SANJI]
Yeah!

361
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,082
[LUFFY]
Set sail!

362
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,022
[NAMI] The giants said that
going straight would take us

363
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,790
to the western end
of the island...

364
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,924
[LUFFY]
Hey! Couldn't you guys

365
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,292
have gotten any
more meat on board?

366
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,460
[ZORO]
Yeah, right.

367
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,929
[SANJI] We can't possibly
preserve any more than this.

368
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,098
It would just spoil
before we could eat it

369
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,702
[NAMI] Are you actively
trying to sink the ship?

370
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,305
Hey! Look at that;
it's the giants!

371
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,975
They must have come
down here to say goodbye.

372
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,082
[BROGGY] A great danger
still lies ahead of you.

373
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,818
[DORRY] It is an obstacle that
has always been here.

374
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,320
Trying to prevent people from
reaching the next island.

375
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,089
[NAMI]
Uhh...

376
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,324
Everyone of you
fought like true warriors

377
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,493
in order to protect
the pride of our duel...

378
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,162
And because you
were willing to do that,

379
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,330
no matter what
enemy you may face...

380
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,004
We will never let them
destroy your pride, friends.

381
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,175
You must have faith in
what we say. Go straight...

382
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,343
No matter what happens,
keep going straight.

383
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,245
Understand?

384
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,514
Yeah, got it...

385
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,783
What was that about?

386
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,251
I don't get it.
What'd he say?

387
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,989
No matter what happens,
we just go straight!

388
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,868
This is goodbye.

389
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,503
Let's meet again someday.

390
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,704
Absolutely.

391
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,706
Look! Over there!

392
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,523
Hello, Island‐Eater.

393
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,024
You will open the path...

394
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,527
In the name of Elbaf,
you will open it!

395
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,532
[roars]

396
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,906
[roars]

397
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,880
[CREW screaming]

398
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,717
Quaaack!

399
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,886
It's a monster!

400
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,091
What the heck is
that guy? A goldfish?

401
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,495
It's a... giant goldfish?

402
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,496
Usopp, hey!

403
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,365
Start working the rudder
or we're gonna be eaten!

404
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,432
Hurry it up!

405
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,903
Yeah... I know but,
we have to go straight ahead...

406
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,404
Isn't that right, Luffy?

407
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,505
[LUFFY]
Mm‐hmm.

408
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,073
We sure do.

409
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,847
Don't be a moron, Luffy!

410
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,950
This isn't going to be anything
like what happened with Laboon.

411
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,051
Yeah, I know...

412
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,586
Now, calm down...

413
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,888
Here... I'll let you
have the last rice cracker.

414
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,123
I don't want a cracker!

415
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,891
If we don't turn the
ship around right now,

416
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,426
that thing is gonna eat us.

417
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,861
Quaaack!

418
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,629
Nami, just give it up.

419
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,101
Luffy! You really sure

420
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,537
we can trust
those little pals of yours?

421
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,305
[LUFFY]
Yup!

422
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,239
Are we actually
going to willingly

423
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,775
head straight into
that beast's belly?!

424
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,946
Uh‐huh! It's too
late to turn now!

425
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,556
You've sure gotten a
lot bigger, Island‐Eater...

426
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,124
Filthy goldfish.

427
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,125
And his size isn't

428
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,795
the only surprising
thing about him, either.

429
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,630
There's also the dung
that he produces

430
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,632
after he devours a island.

431
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,101
The size of that stuff
is quite impressive...

432
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,471
I recall one specimen that's
known as Nothing At All Island.

433
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,773
[DORRY]
Gya, gya, gya, gya!

434
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,142
Yes... We landed
on it a long time ago

435
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,979
and thought it was real
land we were standing on.

436
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,647
I'm beginning
to feel nostalgic...

437
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,848
Watching them sail in,

438
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,484
I remember my old
adventurous days.

439
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,825
[DORRY] The only thing that we
can't pierce with this weapon,

440
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,027
is the great bloodstained snake.

441
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,028
[BROGGY]
Together our weapons

442
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,631
form the most powerful
weapon Elbaf can offer.

443
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,532
The giant spear...

444
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,173
Just go straight...!
Go straight!

445
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,677
What does it matter...?!
We've already been eaten here!

446
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,647
Straight, okay?!
Just keep going!
