00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,739
Seems they're planning to
go in through the west gate.

176
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,676
Damn brats. Let's go!

177
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,846
[MR. 2]
Un... Deux!

178
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,783
[USOPP] Okay! Let's head
for the southwest gate now!

179
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,254
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER] So they're
going to approach three

180
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,657
of Alubarna's five
gates from the west?

181
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,159
If they're gonna split
up and enter that way,

182
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,293
then we'll do the same thing.

183
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,028
We can wipe them
out inside the city!

184
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,532
You're not getting away from me!

185
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,105
[ROYAL SOLDIER J A]
Hey! Someone's coming!

186
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,607
Is it the rebels?

187
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,041
[ROYAL SOLDIER B]
No, wait!

188
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,043
It's the Supersonic
Duck Squadron!

189
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,111
Let them in!

190
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,127
[MR. 2]
I'm not kidding here!

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,997
There's no way you're
getting away with this!

192
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,034
[MR. 4]
Four. Four. Four. Four.

193
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,379
[USOPP] Tee hee hee! Thank you
so much for following us

194
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,180
all the way here.

196
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,420

Now! Stop!

[DUCK B squawks]

198
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,757
[NAMI] Wow, you guys
are very good, you know?

199
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,925
That's right.
I'm the real Princess Vivi.

200
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,428
[ZORO] What are you‐‐I mean,
what are you talking about?

201
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,897
I am the real Princess Vivi!

202
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,036
[SANJI] I wonder if this
is far enough now.

203
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,009
[SANJI] I have to say, it's
really entertaining how easily

204
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,878
you all fell for this.

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,281
Now. We can go ahead and
take these silly cloaks off.

206
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,686
[GROUP] Too bad! It looks
like your guess was wrong!

207
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,758
[GROUP]
What?!

208
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,300
[VIVI]
Thank you so much, everyone.

209
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,970
I have to hurry now.

210
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,939
The rebel army
is almost to the city!

211
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,109
Let's go, Karoo!

[KAROO squawks]

213
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,498
[CROCODILE] Whatever the cost,
Vivi and her friends

214
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,467
must be prevented
from making contact

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,935
with the rebel army.

216
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,977
Camel?!

217
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,980
And I recognize you from
the ship, too, don't I?

218
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,949
Sorry!

219
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,484
Yeah, come on, Zoro,
let 'em have it!

220
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,586
[ZORO]
Would you keep quiet over there?

221
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,521
[MR. 1]
They fooled us.

222
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,522
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Quite a farce.

223
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,991
[ZORO] I don't owe that
anymore! You cleared me!

224
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,094
[SANJI] It looks like there
won't be any rebellion now.

225
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,829
[MISS MERRY CHRISTMAS]
What did you say?

226
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,601
[VIVI]
I have to stop them at any cost.

227
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,138
If I don't, then all of this
struggling has been for nothing!

Secure the cannonballs!

Man your posts! Keep the
artillery under control!

232
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,201
The ground is
really moving, huh?

233
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,204
The enemy army is made up
of two million angry men.

234
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,573
Even the ground shakes
a little before them.

and stay together!

That isn't important right now!

our fight turned out.

You couldn't have
held out longer?

350
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,338
[USOPP]
What are you doing here anyway?

351
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,239
[SANJI]
Your ducks got me.

352
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,307
They came to get
some help for you two.

353
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,508
But that aside...

354
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,144
You let Mr. 2 get
away, didn't you?

355
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,179
Yeah.

356
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,352
[ZORO]
Listen up.

357
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,921
That creepy ballerina's
transformations are perfect.

358
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,189
There's no telling
when he might pose

359
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,491
as one of us and make
an attempt on Vivi's life.

360
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,627
Does everyone understand?

361
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,429
If you ever feel like one
of us is acting suspicious...

362
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,500
...ask them to take
off this wrapping,

363
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,935
reveal their mark.

364
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,204
If they can't do that,
they're an imposter.

365
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,205
Whoa.

366
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,107
Having such a well
thought out plan like this

367
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,943
seems uncharacteristically
smart for you.

368
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,979
So how can we be sure you
aren't already an imposter?

369
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,047
I'll stab you!

370
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,482
Yeah, that's him.

371
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,517
Whew! Definitely Zoro.

372
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,659
You're lying.

373
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,460
You're not really Usopp.

374
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,029
[USOPP chuckles]

375
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,064
Well, that's too bad.

376
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,069
Now, really! You knew? How?

377
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,639
I thought my imitation
was perfect.

378
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,574
We even had a helpful
report from the boss

379
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,410
that you all had the same
bandages wrapped up

380
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,045
on your arm like this.

381
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,313
So smart of you.

382
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,416
[SANJI]
This isn't good.

383
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,585
Vivi's in danger!

384
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:17,269

386
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,613

I know we'll get there... ♪

397
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,464
[SANJI]
That creepy ballerina freak!

398
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,666
If he hurts Vivi at all,
I'm gonna kill him!

399
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,568
[USOPP]
Hey, Chopper! Wake up!

400
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,604
[CHOPPER] Watch out!
She's under the ground there!

401
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,505
[NAMI screams]

402
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,440
[ZORO] Look, just find
someplace to hide!

403
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,808
[VIVI]
I have to do something!

404
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,444
I can't let myself
die here like this!

405
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,179
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

406
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,349
"Alubarna Grieves!
The Fierce Captain Karoo."

407
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,018
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
