who lived in the

The events herein transpired
more than 400 years ago.

141
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,412
There once was a man by
the name of Montblanc Noland

142
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,290
who lived in the
North Blue countryside.

143
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:18,086
Noland, who was an explorer,
always regaled the crowds

144
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,421
with stories of his
incredible exploits.

145

But nobody knew whether or not

146

to take Noland's
tall tales seriously.

147
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,179
One day, upon returning
from yet another adventure,

148
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,057
he reported to his king
all that he had seen.

149
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,018
"I saw a city of gold on
an island in the great sea,"

150
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,186
declared Noland.

151
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,562
And the courageous king decided

152
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,566
that he must have this
treasure for his kingdom.

153
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,819
The king set out with Noland
and two thousand

154
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,320
of his finest soldiers.

155
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,614
Along the way they
endured treacherous storms

156
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,450
and battled many
ferocious sea creatures.

157
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,495
At the end of their journey
only the King, Noland,

158
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,831
and 100 soldiers
survived to set foot

159
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,333
on the island that
housed the city of gold.

160
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,501
And all they found
for their troubles

161
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,422
was a normal island covered
with an ordinary jungle.

162
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:06,008
And so, upon their return,
Noland was sentenced to death

163
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,052
for the crime of
lying to his King.

164
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,972
His last words were as follows.

165
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,600
"I can only assume that the
city of gold sunk into the sea."

166
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,561

court were dumbfounded.

Nobody believed Noland anymore.

spent in shame and ridicule

of death was carried out

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,207
of the infamous
Montblanc Noland?

176
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,501
I heard that fairy tale
all the time as a kid.

177
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,211
But I never knew that
Jaya was the island

178
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,255
where he thought
he saw the city of gold.

179
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,090
When we were growing up
in the North Blue,

180
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,216
we were always warned

181
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,886
that if we lied, we'd suffer
the same fate as Noland

182
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,472
and be ridiculed until we
were eventually put to death.

183
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,223
[laughs]

184
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,351
It makes sense that
Cricket's related to that fool,

185
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,105
but I can't believe that Jaya is
the island from the fairy tale.

186
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,399
Pardon the intrusion,
but if I heard you correctly,

187
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,443
you're saying a descendant
of Noland is here,

188
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,279
400 years after the fact,
looking for that gold?

189
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,573
He's gotta be doing this
to clear his family name

190
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,285
and regain some
small amount of respect.

191
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,039
[laughs]

192
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,291
This story keeps getting
better and better.

193
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,043
[laughs]

194
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,003
Can he seriously
hope to wipe away

195
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
over 400 years
of embarrassment

196
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,590
by bringing back
a few pieces of gold?

197
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,175
What a joke!

198
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,429
Sounds like he's a
few bricks short of a wall.

199
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,315
[NAMI]
Alas, the Liar died

200
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,276
before he could prove
himself to the people.

201
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,361
[sighs]

202
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,154
All he ever really wanted to do

203
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,115
was live the life
of an adventurer.

204
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,242
[USOPP] That last part's
not in the book.

205
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,744
Don't try to tack on your
own sentimental nonsense.

206
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,412
[LUFFY screams]

207
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,623
Did he just fall in the water?

208
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,625
What's going on?

209
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,460
[CRICKET]
Who the hell are you?

210
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,545
You've got nerve,

211
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,130
relaxing at someone's
house without permission.

212
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,299
This is my land,
and I suggest you leave.

213
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,343
Hurry, Usopp. Move it! Go and
fish Luffy out of the sea.

214
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:12,927
[USOPP]
You got it!

215
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,220
I know why you're here.

216
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,222
You're after my gold!

217
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,481
Sanji!

218
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,275
Sanji, no!

219
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,735
Don't worry.
This guy's a terrible shot.

220
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,613
[SANJI]
Hey! Cut it out!

221
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,322
Idiot.

222
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,241
Never underestimate your foe.

223
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,744
[ZORO] Out of the way.
I'll handle this.

224
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,629
You really need to
learn to be more careful.

225
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,548
But I thought I saw...

226
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,800
...bubbles in the water,

227
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,469
so I looked closer and
then a chestnut appeared.

228
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,762
But it wasn't a chestnut.

229
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,516
It was a guy,
and he pulled me in.

230
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,768
[LUFFY]
What's with him?

231
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,608
[CHOPPER]
I need more cold towels.

232
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,402
And open up those windows.

233
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,070
[ZORO]
What's Caisson disease?

234
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,614
[LUFFY]
So this guy is really sick, huh?

235
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,865
Yeah.

236
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,576
Caisson disease is an illness
that sometimes afflicts divers.

237
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,493
Though it's called a disease,

238
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,787
it isn't actually
a chronic condition.

239
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,664
It's caused by a lack
of decompression

240
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,666
when surfacing from the seabed.

241
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,085
The nitrogen in the
blood releases too quickly

242
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,048
and causes gas bubbles to
form in the circulatory system.

243
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,257
And when those
gas bubbles expand

244
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,344
they can cause considerable
damage to muscles and joints

245
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,471
and seriously
decrease blood flow.

246
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,181
So it's a mystery disease.

247
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,223
Think you can help him?

248
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,433
[CHOPPER]
I'm not sure.

249
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,769
My guess is he kept diving
everyday without allowing time

250
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,064
for his body to recover and
it finally caught up with him.

251
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,732
That's why he passed
out during the fight.

252
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,068
But why in the world
did he do that?

253
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,110
[CHOPPER]
I don't know,

254
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,237
but he was taking a big risk.

255
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,366
In some cases,
Caisson disease can cause death.

256
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,035
So he's lucky to be alive.

257
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,090
[SHOJO]
Oh hey, Masira.

258
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,716
I guess you're
still alive after all.

259
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,343
[MASIRA]
Why do you say that?

260
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,469
[SHOJO]
Forget about it.

261
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,429
Do you know what all that
gunfire was about earlier?

262
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,389
[MASIRA]
I'm not sure,

263
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,724
but that's where I'm
headed now, to find out.

264
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,642
[SHOJO]
Well, come on then.

265
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,602
I'm worried about the old‐timer.

266
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,565
Hey, Old‐timer.
Are you all right?

267
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,819
[screams]
They've come to kill us.

268
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,238
What in the world are
you people doing here?

269
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,240
And just what are
you doing to our friend?

270
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,157
We're trying to help.

271
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,118
So I suggest you
either lend us a hand

272
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,577
or find someone else to bother.

273
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,704
Don't antagonize them, Luffy.

274
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,788
You know what
they're capable of,

275
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,249
and now there're two of
those savages to deal with.

276
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,375
[CHOPPER]
They're savages!

277
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,378
[USOPP] Everyone, jump out
the windows and run away.

278
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,172
Thank you, guys.

279
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,632
[USOPP]
What did they say?

280
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,899
[LUFFY] So you guys
live on this island, too?

281
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,777
Yep. This old‐timer's house
is the official headquarters

282
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,904
of the Saruyama
Alliance of Jaya.

283
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,864
We call this home,

284
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,907
but we spend most of
our time on our ships.

285
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,783
We're more comfortable at sea

286
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,785
'cause this place
is too small for us.

287
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,246
[LUFFY] You guys are
too big for your own good.

288
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,831
But it's all in how
you look at it, I guess.

289
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,291
To a giant you'd still look like

290
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,792
nothing more
than a ball of earwax.

291
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,793
[laughter]

292
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,628
Well, those three sure
are getting along well,

293
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,629
now, aren't they?

294
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,715
Yeah, seems like they
have a lot in common.

295
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,549
I'm pretty impressed you managed

296
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,800
to get Masira
here off your ship.

297
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,304
It's quite a feat for someone as
small as you to overpower him.

298
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,805
[LUFFY]
Eh, it wasn't really that hard.

299
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,931
Huh? What's that?

300
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,476
[LUFFY]
I'm sure you could kick his ass.

301
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,311
Luffy! He's waking up!

302
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,729
He's awake?

303
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:55,608
[SHOJO]
He's right!

304
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,152
I can kick Masira's ass!

305
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,654
[LUFFY]
Hey, chestnut head.

306
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,157
I got a question for ya.

307
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,660
[sighs]

308
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,370
I'm sorry I attacked you.

309
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,581
I thought you were nothing more
than another group of bandits

310
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,333
who had come to steal my gold.

311
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,335
Did someone say
something about gold?

312
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,294
Just calm down, Nami.

313
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,713
What exactly was it
you wanted to ask me?

314
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,549
We're searching for sky island
and were told you might be able

315
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,218
to tell us how to get there.

316
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,345
[CRICKET]
Are you serious?

317
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,640
[laughs]

318
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,518
Don't tell me you really
believe that place exists.

319
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,269
Hey! Stop it.

320
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,521
You can't attack a sick man.

321
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,356
You mean there's no sky island?

322
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,358
Are you sure?

323
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,779
I don't know. See...

324
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,533
Nobody knows if the
sky island really exists or not.

325
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,534
I know of only one man

326
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,203
who claims to have seen
the island for himself.

327
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,540
But he's considered
a liar of epic proportions.

328
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,082
Wah!

329
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,543
What are you looking at?

330
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,585
[CRICKET]
There's an old fairy tale

331
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,547
that the people of the
North Blue know very well.

332
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,715
It's called "Noland, the Liar."

333
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,758
Wah!

334
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,345
Stop looking at me, Luffy.
My name's not Noland.

335
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,263
Now that I think about it,

336
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,516
Noland's family name
was also Montblanc.

337
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,893
Does that mean that
two are related somehow?

338
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,061
Is he right?

339
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,981
And is this island the one
mentioned in the fairy tale?

340
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,650
Hmph. Yeah,
Noland's my grandfather's,

341
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,404
grandfather's grandfather. He's
a distant ancestor of mine.

342
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,322
I am his descendant.

343
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,574
But we're so far removed,

344
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,661
I doubt there's even a single
drop of his blood in my veins.

345
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,246
The Montblanc family
was driven out

346
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,415
of the North Blue country
a long time ago,

347
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,252
and we've managed to keep
a very low profile ever since.

348
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,379
People still denounce
the family name.

349
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,756
But we've never
despised him for this.

350
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:43,757
[CHOPPER]
But why?

351
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,010
Because Noland,
contrary to popular belief,

352
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,678
was an very honest person.

353
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,972
That's not what
the fairy tale said.

354
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,557
[CRICKET]
As the story goes,

355
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,727
Noland's last words
were as follows.

356
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,272
"I can only assume that the
city of gold sunk into the sea."

357
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,189
This line is accompanied

358
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,984
by an idiotic face
in the illustration.

359
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,320
But Noland was no idiot.

360
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,571
He knew what he saw,

361
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,698
and I believe he
wasn't lying about it.

362
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,742
Noland was sure the
island he stumbled upon,

363
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,869
where he found
the ruins of a city of gold,

364
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,787
was the island of Jaya.

365
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,333
But when he returned with
the king, there was no gold.

366
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,668
Unsuccessful, he insisted
that the ancient city

367
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,504
had submerged due
to shifts in the earth's crust.

368
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,797
But everyone dismissed this

369
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,051
as the last‐ditch excuse
of a doomed man.

370
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,637
Noland was given
a public execution.

371
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,931
When he died,
so did his discoveries.

372
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,891
Only the legend
of the liar remained.

373
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,892
I get it.

374
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,976
You're trying to find
the ancient city of gold

375
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,061
at the bottom of the sea
in order to finally clear

376
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,022
the Montblanc family name
and prove Noland right.

377
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,899
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,484
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

379
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,655
[CRICKET] I don't really
care if the ancient city of gold

380
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,572
exists or not.

381
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,782
The actions of my ancestor

382
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,076
have nothing to do
with me and my life.

383
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,954
You can't possibly begin to
imagine what it's like as a kid

384
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,914
for everyone to laugh
at you and ridicule you

385
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,458
because you're a descendant
of that idiot, Noland.

386
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,002
That's what I've dealt
with my whole life.

387
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,715
[CRICKET]
Anyway, over the past 400 years

388
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,967
a great many of my family

389
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,012
have set sail to find the city
of gold, prove Noland right,

390
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,682
and restore the Montblanc name.

391
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,934
But each and every one
of them went missing.

392
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,020
I was ashamed to be a member
of such a pathetic family.

393
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,023
So I decided to leave
home become a pirate.

394
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,693
Wow! So you're
a pirate just like us?

395
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,987
I didn't even really
want to become a pirate.

396
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,072
I just wanted out
of Noland's shadow.

397
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,949
To be my own man.

398
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,536
But over time I came
to assemble my own pirate crew.

399
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,706
Finally, I was seen as a
leader, not a laughingstock.

400
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,750
And I spanned the world
looking for adventures.

401
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,504
Then ten years ago as
my crew and I sailed a calm sea,

402
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,382
we discovered this island
purely by chance.

403
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,466
And ironically,

404
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,094
of all my family members
who sought out this place,

405
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,889
who lost their lives doing so,
it was I who found it.

406
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,851
I who despised
the Montblanc name.

407
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,604
We came ashore, but found
no trace of the city of gold.

408
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,939
I stood on a cape of the island

409
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,567
and felt I was
destined to be there.

410
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,402
Let's settle this, Noland.

411
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,404
Once and for all.

412
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,280
[UNDERLING A]
You're on your own.

413
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,906
We don't want anything
to do with this.

414
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,575
We're setting sail and leaving.

415
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,826
[UNDERLING B]
If you wanna stay here

416
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,997
and search for gold that doesn't
exist, you're doing it alone.

417
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,124
[UNDERLING A]
So long, Captain.

418
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,008
[CRICKET] I don't care
if I find the city or not.

419
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm not here to prove
Noland right or wrong.

420
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,889
I have no interest
in rewriting history.

421
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,225
All I'm doing is following
what I believe is my destiny.

422
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,896
This is between me and Noland.

423
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,481
I'm facing what I fear,

424
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,777
and whatever the outcome,
the act is all that matters.

425
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,364
Wow. What a sad story.

426
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,658
But what about the monkeys.

427
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,079
How did they come to be on
this island with you anyways?

428
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,372
[USOPP] I'm sure that's
another story of bravery

429
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,083
and the face of incredible odds.

430
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,835
Your life reads like a great
book you know, Cricket?

431
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,921
They were just
fans of the fairy tale.

432
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,297
They're fans?

433
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,257
[NAMI]
How did they find you?

434
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,343
I think it was
five or six years ago.

435
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,137
They heard a rumor
and set out to find me.

436
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,474
Those two truly believe that the
city of gold exists somewhere.

437
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,559
And they're helping me find it.

438
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,812
Ahhh!

439
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,023
Shojo, you have no idea
what you just got yourself into!

440
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,149
Bring it on you big ape.

441
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,275
I'm ready when you are.

442
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,277
Just step up and
you'll get knocked down.

443
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,280
[CRICKET] The sea surrounding
this island is very deep.

444
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,157
And in those dark, cold depths,

445
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,327
you're surrounded by a
profound sense of solitude.

446
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,205
[CRICKET]
When I first arrived here,

447
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,000
I spent my time searching
the sea bed alone.

448
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,585
They entered my life
without permission

449
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,922
and assigned themselves
as my crew without asking.

450
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,466
And they do nothing
but fight all the time.

451
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,469
But having these idiots
around puts me at ease.

452
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,223
And truthfully,
I enjoy their company.

453
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,808
You understand?

454
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,977
I understand completely.

455
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,395
True friends lift each other up

456
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,148
and give each other
strength in times of need.

457
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,900
Are you just about finished
telling us your life story?

458
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,527
Shut your mouth
you ungrateful brat.

459
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,196
[screams]

460
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,322
Stop it.

461
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,909
Look, all I really want to
know about is sky island.

462
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,161
[CRICKET chuckles]

463
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
You're a pushy guy, aren't ya?

464
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,873
But like I told you earlier,

465
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,917
the only person who's ever
seen the sky island is Noland.

466
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,919
And nobody knows
if he was telling the truth

467
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,130
or if it was just
another tall tale.

468
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,465
[LUFFY] Is there any record
of his trip to the island?

469
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,886
Officially, no, but he
does mention it in here.

470
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,053
What do you have there?

471
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,264
That isn't
Noland's logbook, is it?

472
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
[CRICKET]
Yeah, it is.

473
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,310
Read from the
bottom of that page.

474
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,352
[NAMI]
Amazing.

475
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,230
This logbook is
over 400 years old.

476
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,524
June 21st, year 1120.

477
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,526
A sunny day on the
Sea of Ephemeris.

478
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,862
Upon departing
from the Jolly Villa.

479
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,198
We left the harbor and
sailed into the rising sun

480
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,158
at a heading of
east by northeast

481
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,410
with the wind at out back.

482
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,497
At midday we happened across
a bumboat carrying a rare item.

483
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,043
A single person contraption
called a sky waver.

484
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,046
This small, mysterious vessel
can generate its own wind

485
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,632
and sail at great speeds
even on a still day.

486
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,134
But the ski‐like ship
was not easily maneuvered.

487
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,219
I couldn't control it,

488
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,638
although my crew has
taken quite a liking to it.

489
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
I gotta get one of those things.

490
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,558
Keep going!
Don't stop reading!

491
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,102
[NAMI] Uh, we were told the
vessel had been manufactured

492
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,395
on the sky island,

493
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,315
and that many more interesting
devices could be found there.

494
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
It brought to mind
an explorer friend of mine

495
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,319
who once showed me
the most unusual specimen,

496
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,196
a living sky fish.

497
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,448
I have never seen a fish with
such a bizarre appearance

498
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,283
‐‐in all my years.
‐‐Sky fish?

499
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,953
[NAMI] This island remains
the only unexplored domain,

500
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,497
and as a sailor and adventurer
I feel it is my destiny

501
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,666
to one day reach
the sea in the sky.

502
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,251
Montblanc Noland.

503
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,585
Do you know what this means?

504
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,504
The sky island
must really exist.

505
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,464
Just like Robin said it did!

506
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,925
Now we just gotta
figure out how to get there.

507
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,261
[CHOPPER]
The sky island does exist!

508
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,014
[MASIRA]
You're up?

509
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,266
You feeling all right?

510
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,308
Better than ever.

511
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,518
Glad to hear it.

512
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,187
[MASIRA] This jerk snuck up
on me and attacked me from‐‐

513
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:12,854
[CRICKET]
Shut up.

514
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,314
I need to ask you something.

515
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,691
What do you think of those guys?

516
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,651
Why you askin', Old‐timer?

517
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,444
It seems that they're
determined to get

518
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,072
to sky island no matter what.

519
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,573
Sky island?

520
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,326
You know there's only
one way for them to get there.

521
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,704
And if they try
to get there on their own,

522
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,289
they'll die.

523
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,748
Exactly.

524
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,001
I think we should
help them along.

525
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,295
So, what do you
guys think about that?

526
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:06,325
<i>♪Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

527
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear‐blue sky...</i>

528
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,623
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

529
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:20,672
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

530
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,356
<i>When I am alone</i>

531
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:43,195
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

532
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,614
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

533
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:50,452
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

534
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:55,457
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

535
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,834
<i>until I recalled...</i>

536
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,589
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

537
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,385
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

538
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:12,140
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...♪</i>

539
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,231
[LUFFY]
And we're off!

540
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:19,815
Finally!

541
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,774
To the sky!

542
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,734
[USOPP] I hope this
place has nice beaches.

543
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
[LUFFY]
To the sky!

544
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,445
[USOPP] Now this is
the kind of adventure

545
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,447
Captain Usopp deserves!

546
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,408
[NAMI] You know it's a
life‐threatening journey.

547
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,743
[USOPP] So? That's
what makes it exciting.

548
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,994
I guess.

549
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,455
[NAMI] I've heard of a scaredy
cat, but not a scaredy captain.

550
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,124
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

551
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,835
"Steer for the Clouds!
Capture the South Bird!"

552
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,504
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
