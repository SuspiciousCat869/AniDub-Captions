WEBVTT

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.347
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.018
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.422
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.325
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.531
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.270
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:43.360
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:45.263
as the New World.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.775
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.044
they held.

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.289
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.132
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.671
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.045
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.484
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.964
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:18.997 --> 00:03:21.536
of the New World,
the Straw Hats form an alliance

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.672
with Law.

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.110
Their current objective is
to destroy a man-made

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:28.483
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:30.253
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:32.959
at the Corrida Colosseum
with the Flame-Flame fruit

00:03:32.992 --> 00:03:35.732
as the prize, he decides
to join and compete

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.304
against titanic contenders from
all over the New World.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.480
All right! Here we go!

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.850
Gaon Cannon!

00:03:44.883 --> 00:03:45.885
Fire!

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.358
Oh, that won't do!

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:54.369
[GIOLLA yells]

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:55.738
Got ya!

00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.309
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:03:58.343 --> 00:03:59.579
[MOMONOSUKE]
Head blow!

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.725
Eight centuries ago.

00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:08.897
That's how far back
this little story begins.

00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:10.300
Law.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.506
Twenty kings from
20 countries met

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.745
at the center of the world.

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:19.485
They formed an alliance and
became a single organization.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.023
Today, we know it as
the World Government.

00:04:24.294 --> 00:04:26.499
The kings who created
this governing body

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:29.672
decided to move to
the Holyland of Marie Jois

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:32.344
and live there
with their families.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:36.119
There was only one, the
Nefertari Family of Alabasta,

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:38.790
that refused to reside
in the capital.

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:41.630
The descendants
of those 19 creators

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:43.066
still dwelling in the city

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.473
control nearly the entire
world and go by the title

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:48.544
of Celestial Dragons.

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:51.115
Out of necessity,
the countries needed to select

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:55.157
new kings to govern and
replace the missing rulers.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.797
For instance, in the case
of my native Dressrosa,

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.835
the Riku Family was
selected to govern

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:02.872
over the island.

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:05.210
And the old royalty
who chose to move

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:08.951
to the Holyland of Marie
Jois all those years ago.

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:12.792
The Don Quixote Family!

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:45.157
Okay. She's toast. Good.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.158
Did you see?

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:47.529
I went hm!

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:49.699
And I took her out with
one big swing!

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:50.835
A clean blow!

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:52.772
Almost like it was
muscle memory for you!

00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:54.275
D-Do you think so?

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:55.210
Thanks a lot!

00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:58.249
Muscles...
Wait. I don't have those.

00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.418
How would I know?

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:02.424
Yo ho ho ho!

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:04.362
Well we can't throw her over.

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:06.165
Yeah, she'd sink.

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:08.671
I think I'll pass on
the panties this time.

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:11.977
Oh? Panties?
You say you'd like to see them?

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.683
[BROOK] Trust me, I wouldn't
dream of such a thing, Madam!

00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:16.418
[MOMONOSUKE] Should I hit
her harder this time?

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:18.055
No, just leave her alone.

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.694
We have to go
meet up with Traffy.

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.299
Right.
He wants us to take Caesar.

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:24.902
But I wonder why.

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.609
[LAW]
Look. Take the ship...

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:29.779
...and head for Green Bit, now!

00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:32.283
I want to leave Caesar with you!

00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:34.889
This whole situation
is so bizarre.

00:06:34.922 --> 00:06:37.762
But Doflamingo did resign
from the Seven Warlords,

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.766
and at our request, I might add.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.204
So I suppose we
must return Caesar.

00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:44.475
Oh, don't be a fool.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.378
You haven't got a clue,
have you?

00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:49.953
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:51.890
[GIOLLA] You think the Young
Master would actually

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:54.194
negotiate with the likes of you?

00:06:54.228 --> 00:06:56.566
Just because he said he
left the Seven Warlords

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.469
doesn't mean he did!

00:06:58.504 --> 00:06:59.672
Huh?

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.210
That's it.
Tell us what you mean, now!

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:03.948
Did he or didn't he?

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:07.254
Ouch! You brat! I'll kill you!

00:07:07.287 --> 00:07:09.458
[MOMONOSUKE crying]
Nami!

00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.228
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:14.435
No, the Young Master didn't
quit the Seven Warlords.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.571
Sorry.

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:17.107
You've fallen right into our
trap and given Violet

00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:18.977
the chance to
discover your plan!

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.050
By now, I'm sure all your
friends have been captured!

00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:23.253
[GROUP]
What?!

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.225
[GIOLLA laughs, coughs]

00:07:28.462 --> 00:07:30.801
[CROWD cheering]

00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:40.921
[GYATS] Ladies and gentlemen,
this final match

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.393
is the showdown we've
all been waiting for!

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:46.065
It's time for Block D!

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.302
Let's watch these
tenacious competitors

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:50.942
duke it out for survival!

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.277
It's a full house!

00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.218
But then, the more fighters
we have, the bloodier!

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:58.490
The first contender
to keep an eye on

00:07:58.524 --> 00:08:00.293
is this imposing fellow!

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:03.466
A class-A war criminal from
the Sea Battle of Dias!

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:20.266
Suleiman the Beheader!

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:23.607
Secondly...

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:35.965
The fearless admiral of the
Yonta Maria Grand Fleet!

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:38.770
"The Surmounter" Orlumbus!

00:08:40.406 --> 00:08:44.181
A military captain from the
Majiatsuka Kingdom to the south!

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.761
Rolling Logan!

00:08:55.572 --> 00:08:57.742
And that's not all!

00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:07.193
A fighting lion, Agyo!

00:09:12.103 --> 00:09:14.174
[COMPETITORS yell]

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:19.451
[GYATS]
An arsonist, Damask!

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:21.757
[COMPETITORS yell]

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.227
[GYATS]
A sorcerer, Mummy!

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:42.297
[GYATS]
And a gladiator, Agilia!

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.506
With so many
impressive competitors here,

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.842
it's anyone's game.

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.147
Now! Although the match
is just beginning,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.820
right off the bat,
one star is shining bright!

00:09:53.854 --> 00:09:56.158
That's right, folks,
you guessed it!

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:01.068
Cavendish of the White Horse!

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:09.417
Who's this?

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:17.868
Oh, me?
Gardoa, handsome bounty hunter.

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:24.214
Ah! Wow, Gardoa! You're cute!

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.489
Why you little...

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.297
[GARDOA] I see you're
admiring my shining spear.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.001
I use the bounty from
each pirate I catch

00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:36.238
to buy an even more
glistening weapon.

00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:39.645
It's like a medal
of honor to me.

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:42.317
Fortunately for me, there are
plenty of valuable targets

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:45.357
in this competition.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.632
For example, I hear you're
worth 280 million Berries.

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:52.805
Why, that'd buy a spear
made of diamonds!

00:11:12.778 --> 00:11:14.014
Smells lovely.

00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:16.819
Enough!

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:20.694
Where'd you--?

00:11:20.728 --> 00:11:21.930
[CAVENDISH]
Over here.

00:11:24.468 --> 00:11:26.706
A diamond spear, huh?

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.008
How gaudy.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.311
Know this. For those who
dare try to upstage me.

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:49.986
The consequences are severe.

00:11:54.762 --> 00:11:58.036
Ah! Sorry. We changed our minds!

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:59.539
Please win!

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:01.610
[MAN A] That pretty boy's
tougher than he looks!

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:03.680
[CROWD cheering]

00:12:09.024 --> 00:12:10.360
[CAVENDISH]
Yes!

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:12.865
Straw Hat!
Do you hear the cheers?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.602
The crowd loves me!

00:12:14.636 --> 00:12:16.806
I'm more popular than you!

00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:20.648
Hey, get out of the
way, Cabbage!

00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.121
I wanna watch Rebecca,
but I just see your dumb face!

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:25.591
[INMATE A]
Yeah, what he said!

00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.360
[INMATE B] No one cares
about your goofy ass!

00:12:27.394 --> 00:12:28.563
[INMATE C]
Get outta the way!

00:12:31.936 --> 00:12:32.972
[COMPETITOR M]
C'mere!

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.150
[COMPETITOR P]
Yeah, you're history!

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:43.927
Things are shaping up
just as we predicted!

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.432
Many combatants are ganging
up on the ever-hated

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:49.906
Rebecca in hopes of being
the one to slay her!

00:12:49.939 --> 00:12:53.747
Hold on!
'Cause this could be the end.

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.186
Look out behind you!

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.859
You're dead!

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.366
Die, Rebecca!

00:13:40.072 --> 00:13:42.477
[COMPETITOR W] You're about
to be Fighting Fish food!

00:14:43.934 --> 00:14:45.136
No way.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:47.641
So you're a Celestial Dragon.

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:48.843
I don't believe it!

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:54.556
[DOFLAMINGO]
That's me.

00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:56.391
Well, that was me at least.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:04.040
But not anymore.

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:07.682
A man's destiny has nothing
to do with bloodline.

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:10.086
Not many people can
say they've lived a life

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.925
as checkered as I have.
That's for sure.

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.599
[laughs]

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:17.467
Who cares?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.738
Stop rambling, bastard!

00:15:24.782 --> 00:15:26.719
[DOFLAMINGO]
Sorry, Law.

00:15:26.753 --> 00:15:29.458
Believe me, I'd love
nothing more than

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:31.563
to knock back a few
drinks and tell you

00:15:31.596 --> 00:15:33.867
my life story.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.940
But I don't have
time for all that.

00:15:36.973 --> 00:15:41.682
The Straw Hats are in Dressrosa
and I need to address that.

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.589
Plenty of others have
made the mistake

00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:47.159
of underestimating
the Straw Hats,

00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:49.330
and I don't want
to end up like them.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.886
So what? You're done?

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:00.954
Not at all.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.562
It's just that I heard a
thunderclap coming from

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.365
the direction of the sea.

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.469
What does the sky look like?

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:09.605
Thunderclap?

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.545
[FUJITORA] I may be blind,
but I've always had

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:17.421
a keen sense of the weather,
or at 'least I thought I did.

00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:19.123
Maybe I'm just getting old.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.699
[LAW] Nami controls the
weather, doesn't she?

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.669
The ship must be here!

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.775
Hurry up!
You have my heart, don't you?

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:29.445
Well, hand it over!

00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:32.217
What is taking you so long?

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.287
Give it back at once!

00:16:36.827 --> 00:16:38.864
No point. Think about it.

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:41.803
I never said it was
Caesar's heart, did I?

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.105
What?!

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:45.678
You've been keeping that
a secret all this time?

00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:47.547
How is that possible?

00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:50.453
My heart is missing
from my body!

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:53.091
I can't feel a heartbeat!
I checked!

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.176
[yells]

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.147
What are you doing?

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.552
Stop that! I'll die!

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:19.477
Guess I'm fine.

00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:20.947
[MARINE A yells]

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.855
[MARINES chattering]

00:17:27.294 --> 00:17:29.231
A Marine?! Really?!

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:31.001
Then where's my heart?

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.772
That's one of my men.

00:17:32.805 --> 00:17:34.440
What is the meaning of this?

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:38.616
Room!

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.660
Gravity. Nice trick.

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:46.966
Keep it up or else
I might get away!

00:17:48.136 --> 00:17:49.137
[LAW]
Shambles!

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.866
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Joker! Help me!

00:18:08.543 --> 00:18:10.479
[DOFLAMINGO]
You've got a lot of energy, Law.

00:18:13.754 --> 00:18:16.926
Poor fool. He should give up.
It's useless.

00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.170
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Let go of me!

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.608
And tell me what you did
with my heart, you brute!

00:18:26.846 --> 00:18:30.119
Ha. You know there's
nowhere to run, right?

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:35.496
Wherever you go, I'll catch you!

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:51.562
[NAMI]
You see Traffy?

00:18:51.595 --> 00:18:54.535
Nah. The fog is way too thick.

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.304
Just looks like
some weird forest.

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:08.195
Don't get me wrong, I don't
want to believe anything

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:10.567
that old hag told us, but still.

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:14.474
What if when we go
to pick up Caesar,

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:16.780
Law's plan has
already backfired?

00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:18.850
What do you think will
happen to us then?

00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.956
Well, it's simple.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.492
We're going to die.

00:19:23.526 --> 00:19:25.196
[GROUP]
No!

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.966
Oh, no!

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.235
[GROUP yells]

00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:31.876
Ow, what happened?

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.946
That hurt. Someone there?

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:35.917
[MOMONOSUKE, NAMI yell]

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:41.428
[CHOPPER]
What the--?

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:45.135
Ah! Something's coming this way!

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:52.517
Fighting Fish.
An entire school of the things!

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:58.429
It's your fault!

00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:01.368
You steered the ship
too close to the island!

00:20:01.402 --> 00:20:03.206
Our fault?

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:05.309
What's a Fighting Fish?

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:08.750
[GIOLLA] They're monsters,
deadly enough to sink a warship!

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:10.920
[MOMONOSUKE]
Nami, save me!

00:20:30.326 --> 00:20:32.564
[LAW]
That's it! Keep chasing me!

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.737
If he turns his
attention to the ship,

00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:37.106
then it's all over for us!

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.549
First, I need to draw
Doflamingo to the bridge

00:20:41.582 --> 00:20:43.586
while the others grab Caesar!

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.323
Then I'll just keep
him distracted

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:47.794
for a few more minutes!

00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:50.733
That way, I can buy enough
time for the ship to leave!

00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:56.812
[DOFLAMINGO] Looks like he's
about to cross the bridge.

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:58.015
What for?

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.819
That's Dressrosa.

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:02.022
I'll have the
advantage over there.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.803
--[GROUP yells]
--[LAW] Oh, no.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:18.823
[GROUP yells]

00:21:18.856 --> 00:21:20.560
Idiots! Quiet!

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.039
Now I get it.

00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:29.010
[GROUP yells]

00:21:29.044 --> 00:21:32.117
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.753
[LAW]
Doflamingo, wait!

00:21:33.787 --> 00:21:35.524
This doesn't involve them!

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:36.992
[DOFLAMINGO]
Too late, Law.

00:21:38.228 --> 00:21:40.165
[GROUP yells]

00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:45.877
Please don't let them
destroy the Sunny!

00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:48.816
Stop that now!
I'll turn you into fish sticks!

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.603
This is strange,
where did they go?

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:01.542
I'm so afraid, Bone-Kichi!
What should we do now?

00:22:01.575 --> 00:22:04.782
Let's see.
H-Here, fishy, fishy!

00:22:04.815 --> 00:22:06.051
Whoa!

00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:07.687
What is it now?

00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:11.729
Doflamingo's flying this way!

00:22:11.762 --> 00:22:12.864
[GROUP yells]

00:22:12.897 --> 00:22:14.166
Young Master!

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:16.706
[NAMI]
This is a nightmare!

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:18.843
And it just keeps
on getting worse!

00:22:18.877 --> 00:22:20.613
[GROUP]
Help!

00:22:20.647 --> 00:22:22.283
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:24.320
I hope you're watching, Law.

00:22:24.353 --> 00:22:26.291
Because I'm about to
eviscerate your pathetic

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:29.565
little companions right
before your eyes!

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.134
No, Stop!

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:38.415
Help us! Traffy!

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.152
[SANJI]
Hey!

00:22:41.623 --> 00:22:43.593
You made my crewmates cry!

00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:46.999
You're going down!

00:22:48.502 --> 00:22:50.573
Sanji's here!

00:23:03.398 --> 00:23:06.505
Ha. This should be fun.
Let's go.

00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:16.893
[NARRATOR] When all hope
seems lost for Nami's group.

00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:19.565
Sanji appears just in time.

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:21.602
Although Doflamingo's
power easily defeated

00:23:21.635 --> 00:23:23.272
Trafalgar D. Law in the past,

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:24.975
this monstrous villain
is about to contend

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:27.113
with Sanji's scorching
leg attacks.

00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:29.985
And so, their epic showdown
is set in motion!

00:23:30.019 --> 00:23:31.889
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.922 --> 00:23:35.496
"A Big Clash!
Sanji vs. Doflamingo!"

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.701
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
