We're battle cooks now!

Set sail, Mackerel Head One,
the Baratie's secret weapon!

177
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,620
So If you wanna live,
I'd suggest running away now!

What is that thing?

179
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,361
That thing is so... cool!

just waiting to be unleashed!

Did we bump into something?

[CARNE]
We're not moving!

rule... the oceans!

Oh no, you're not... I am!

I don't have time for
these stupid games!

No way!

He's got legs of steel!

215
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,999
He kicked back that crazy boat
just like it was nothing!

216
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,835
Very impressive.

00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,171
Nice kick!

Stop acting so cool!

this up another time?

[PIRATE J]
You guys still don't get it.

233
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,648
Even well armed,
you're still just cooks,

234
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,017
and we're expert fighters that
are way out of your league.

235
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,852
So why don't you be
good little cooks,

236
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,788
and run along to
a safer restaurant?

237
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,055
Maybe one on land, huh?

238
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,793
C'mon, guys, why are you lettin'
'em beat you up so easily, huh?

239
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,796
And you still call
yourselves fighting cooks?!

240
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,564
Well, these pirates
are really good!

241
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,133
They're totally different from
the ones we've fought before!

242
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,902
[PIRATE J]
It's insulting to lump us in

243
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,804
with that average riffraff...

244
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,238
We are the great Krieg Pirates!

245
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,074
And we're the absolute
rulers of the East Blue!

246
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,709
Let it be known to all...

247
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,745
...that this garish
boat already belongs...

248
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,214
...to the great and
powerful Krieg Pirates!

249
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,349
I'm afraid you're mistaken...

250
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,153
You and your cronies will never
set foot in our restaurant.

He's right, men!

252
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,763
[PATTY] You know what,
I've been a cook all my life!

253
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,031
I've worked at a
lot of restaurants,

254
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:56,001
and gotten fired from them all
for scuffling and livin' hard!

255
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,905
And after years of wandering,
we finally found a home here!

[PATTY]
Anybody here!

257
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,742
This is the restaurant that's

00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,278
owned by a guy name
Red Foot Zeff, right?!

Hey! We found this "Damn Cooks
Wanted" sign, is it true?!

260

[ZEFF]
Yeah... It's true.

261
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,958
[ZEFF]
But you need to understand

262
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,694
that this is no
ordinary restaurant.

263
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,896
It really doesn't matter
who they are...

264
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,130
...or where they come from...

265
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,932
...if someone comes in hungry...

266
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,635
...we will feed them
until they're stuffed!

267
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,405
Do I make myself clear?!
Can you handle that?

Sir!

00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,883
I wouldn't serve
anyone slop like this!

and hit me for, huh?!

00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,391
We like fighting and cooking,
so this place is perfect for us.

That's right! There's
no other place like this!
