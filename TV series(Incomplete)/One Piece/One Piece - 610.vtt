00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.269
[crashing]

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:24.944
[DRAGON yelps]

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.546
[DRAGON] Watch what you
are doing, insolent fellow!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.049
[LUFFY]
Uh? Huh?

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:34.487
[DRAGON whimpers]

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.223
[LUFFY]
H-Huh?

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:58.611
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Hmph.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:02.515
Curses. I loathe this
stupid "secret room"!

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:07.119
Too bad, right? But once
we're done, I'll be free.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:09.822
And I'll never have
to come here again.

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:12.825
The Straw Hats have
overstayed their welcome.

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:16.996
I'd say it's time for them
to be properly punished.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.098
I've got Joker on my side.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.767
And now I have the opportunity
to kill all of them

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.236
in the ideal manner!

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.340
Master! We're awaiting orders!
We're ready for combat!

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:31.076
Yes. But may I ask why
you've summoned us here

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.345
to Vegapunk's former
command room?

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:36.382
Wasn't he responsible for
the accident four years ago?

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.751
We've got a score to
settle with him, too!

00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:39.718
Let's get 'em!

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.654
Why're we wastin' time
standing around here

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.955
staring at each other?

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.658
I mean, shouldn't we
be fighting?

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.227
No. Not yet.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.930
You gentlemen are
my backup plan.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:53.399
You're the best soldiers I have!

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.236
So, I cannot risk losing you.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.505
[gasps]
Master!

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:05.344
Now, allow me to explain
the plan to all of you.

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:10.115
As I said before, once the gates
to C and D have been closed,

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:12.451
the only open routes
through the laboratory

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:15.321
will lead to the first
floor of Building R,

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:18.557
which is directly beneath us.

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.560
The Straw Hats, G-5,
the children...

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:24.230
It doesn't matter whether
they're friend or foe.

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:28.067
All of the survivors in the lab
will be forced into that room.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.702
The first floor has
external vents

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:31.570
which can bring in outside air.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:32.705
In other words,

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.040
we'll be able to fill the room
with Land of the Dead!

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:38.043
There will be no way
for them to escape!

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:40.813
They'll be stuck
breathing that air!

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:43.515
It'll be like a
giant gas chamber.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.352
And soon, they will all die!

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:48.420
The best part is
we'll be broadcasting it,

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:52.591
so my shadow brokers in the New
World can witness the slaughter!

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:56.362
Then they'll respect me!
They'll know my greatness!

00:14:56.395 --> 00:15:01.400
[laughs]

00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:11.810
Uh. I hate to ask this,
but Master Caesar.

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:12.945
Huh?

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.281
I don't mean to doubt
you or anything, sir,

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.050
but did you create the
deadly poison gas?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.819
Why, yes. I did.

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:22.354
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:27.393
[SUBORDINATES murmur]

00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.128
Forgive me, Master.

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.397
It seems a lot like
Vegapunk's gas.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.401
The one from the accident four
years ago, and thing is, Master,

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:36.769
it freaks us out.

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:38.304
It's awful.

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.408
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Uh! Huh?

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:54.086
[CAESAR CLOWN grunts]

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.091
[CAESAR CLOWN whimpers]

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.025
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.627
Uh, Master?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.632
[CAESAR CLOWN whimpers]
Dammit!

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:09.802
Just allow me to
explain everything!

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:11.971
Please, men!

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:13.772
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:18.344
That day... It still haunts me!

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.880
Oh, how I tried to
stop the mad scientist!

00:16:21.914 --> 00:16:25.484
"No! What if this dangerous
weapon exploded", I cried!

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:29.088
"Just think of all the innocent
people who would be killed!"

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.991
"Please, Vegapunk!
Don't do this!"

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.464
[CAESAR CLOWN]
But there was no stopping him.

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:43.802
And now, he's the head of
the Navy Science Division,

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:47.573
and he's widely considered the
world's greatest scientist!

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:51.210
It's not fair!
It should've been me!

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.512
I cannot accept it!

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:56.482
How could someone so heartless
come to be praised

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.850
as the best of all?

00:16:57.883 --> 00:16:59.785
Tell me, after what he's done,

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:03.288
does he still deserve
to be called the greatest?

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.026
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.628
Master.

00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.930
That's why... I must
prove him wrong!

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.666
I don't want to create a
weapon of mass murder,

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.236
but I'm afraid it must be
done in order to prove

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:21.173
I am the greatest
scientist in the world!

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.742
Please! Trust me!

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.845
[SUBORDINATES sob]

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.815
Once the Navy realizes
that I deserve

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:33.952
to be their lead scientist,
then I'll be fulfilled.

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:38.457
And I shall use my knowledge
to bring peace and unity!

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.360
[SUBORDINATES sob]

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.828

[SUBORDINATE C]
Forgive me, Master!

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:46.698
You're right!
How could I doubt you?

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.666
I'm sorry!

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:50.869
Me, too! You are the
god of salvation!

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:56.141
[SUBORDINATES sob]

00:17:56.175 --> 00:18:00.345
Master!

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:05.217
We love you! Master!

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.853
Why, thank you! I love you, too!

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.822
All of you!

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.892
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:16.495
[MARINE J]
Don't do it, Caesar! Stop it!

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.997
I'm warning you! Shut it down!

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:25.337
[MARINE J] You're putting
everyone on the island

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.205
in danger!

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.806
You realize if that
weapon explodes,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.941
innocent lives will be lost!

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:33.212
Shut up! Ignorant fool!
This is a military testing site!

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.647
This is my job! Back off!

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:36.915
As you may know,

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.852
the Navy wants to kill as many
pirates as they possibly can.

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:42.221
I'm simply creating a new
weapon for them designed

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.422
to do just that!

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:45.991
It's dangerous! I'm sure your
weapon will kill pirates,

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:47.626
but you know what
else it'll do?

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:48.927
Kill a bunch of civilians!

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.529
[laughs]

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:54.366
Idiot! See, that's something
called collateral damage.

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:57.736
If they don't evacuate,
they deserve what's coming!

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.606
Wipe them all out and we'll
finally have world peace!

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.573
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.942
How could you say that, Caesar?
You're so--

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.313
What, you think I'm cruel?
Perhaps, but so are you.

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:11.650
Think about it. You're using the
prisoners as your guinea pigs.

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:14.486
Let's be honest, is there really
a difference between them?

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.155
I think not.

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:18.857
Fleet Admiral Sengoku
may be soft,

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:21.460
but Admiral Akainu,
on the other hand...

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:24.429
I bet he would love
one of my weapons.

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:27.666
Now scram! I don't need
you interrupting my work.

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:32.204
[laughs] Vegapunk's just
jealous, and I can't blame him.

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.605
I am a genius.

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:36.408
Besides, his silly human
enlargement experiment

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:38.644
is nothing but a failure.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.046
You'd need to be a real
magician to make the human body

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:43.448
grow that much in
such a short time.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.884
I tried to tell him what to do.

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:48.854
What he needs is children.
Those who are growing.

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:52.124
And fill them with drugs.
I believe that's the only way.

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:55.360

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.695

Don't try to fight us!

How dare you manhandle
me like this?

I'm almost finished making
a weapon so powerful

it's beyond comprehension!
