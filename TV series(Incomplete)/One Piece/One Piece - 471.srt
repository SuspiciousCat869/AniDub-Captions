1
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,289
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,959
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,694
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,697
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:45,098
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,868
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,703
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,606
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,442
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,011
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,678
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,982
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,252
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,522
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:11,758
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,730
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,070
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,339
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,141
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,308
The Whitebeard Pirates have

21
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,144
successfully
pushed into the bay,

22
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,480
but a massive number of Marines
still block the path to Ace.

23
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,583
The battle is heating up!

24
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,084
After Luffy narrowly avoids

25
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,785
a deadly encounter with Mihawk,

26
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,223
a battalion of human weapons
known as Pacifistas appear.

27
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,726
[PIRATE AA]
Look at the bay head!

28
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,360
There's something out there!

29
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,898
[PIRATE BB]
What... What the hell are they?

30
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,234
Of course.
I wondered when I'd get

31
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,437
a glimpse of the
Government's human weapons.

32
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,906
[IVANKOV]
Huh? Huh? Huh?

33
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,407
I'm confused.

34
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,046
[LUFFY] "The Extermination
Strategy in Action!

35
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,615
The Power of Pacifistas!"

36
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,301
They all look just
like the Warlord, Kuma!

37
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,504
No way. It's gotta be
some kind of an illusion.

38
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,305
Well, this just got weird.

39
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,616
I think I know those guys--

40
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,818
they went on a rampage
here a while back!

41
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,321
[MAN B] It's like having
an army of Warlords!

42
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,191
But there weren't that
many when they attacked us!

43
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,534
[DRAKE roaring]

44
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,438
Head office! Reporting in!

45
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:10,377
You gotta hear this!
Hello? Anyone?

46
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,558
So this one's gotta be
the real Kuma, right?

47
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,095
I thought this
was just some rumor,

48
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,931
but I've heard word that
Dr. Vegapunk has been working on

49
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:33,166
some kind of human weapon,
and he's been shipping

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,968
out the prototypes
to backup the Navy.

51
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,469
This could be them.

52
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,539
[PIRATE AA] Well, That looks
like a "human weapon"

53
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,807
if I've ever seen one.

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,543
[PIRATE BB]
Sure, but why are they all Kuma?

55
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,144
Hey, Uncle!

56
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,314
This isn't looking like
the plan we talked about!

57
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,516
I thought the pirates were
supposed to be rounded up

58
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,887
inside the bay, so we could pick
'em off like fish in a barrel.

59
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,389
Why're they scattered
all over the place?

60
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,161
That big guy with the axe--

61
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,296
Can you make out
what he's saying?

62
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,303
I believe I've
deciphered the Navy's plan.

63
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,771
They leaked the intel about

64
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:13,239
the decision to
expedite Ace's execution,

65
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:16,543
knowing that it would send us
into a frenzy to save him.

66
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,547
After that, all they had to do
was slowly back up their forces

67
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,317
to fully lure us
pirates into the bay.

68
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,619
And then they block
off the bay head with

69
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:29,957
their human weapons
to close the trap. Checkmate.

70
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,526
Now it all makes sense.
That's why Whitebeard ordered us

71
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,695
to sink those Navy ships
instead of advancing.

72
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,264
He saw through their plan.

73
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:40,367
If it weren't for him,
we would've been trapped.

74
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,235
Yeah.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,849
We can still attack
from the front and the rear,

76
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,184
even if they're not
closed in the bay!

77
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,955
Stick to the plan and take
down the allied forces first.

78
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,691
Eliminate any
pirate that's trying

79
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,159
to stray from the
enclosure to advance.

80
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,964
And there you go.

81
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,768
Got it. And if our ships
get caught in the crossfire?

82
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:16,303
Let's try to keep it
to a minimum, okay?

83
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,538
Heh. So, that's the plan, huh?

84
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,375
[SENTOMARU]
Then, time to work!

85
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,390
Line up as many
Kumas as you want!

86
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,459

reach the plaza!

00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:23,030
[IZO] The Navy's pullin' back,
so now's our chance!

178
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,866
We're breakin' through
these bastards!

179
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:30,370
Ooh. Lookee here.
It's a real fight.

180
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:58,965
[MORIA laughing]

181
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:02,369
[MORIA] Well, if it isn't
10th Division Commander Curiel!

182
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,937
Look at that angry glower.

183
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:07,073
Do you really wanna die
with such a sour face?

184
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,845
You do realize you'll be buried
in this bay if you stay here?

185
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,881
First, Ace will die,

186
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,983
and then your cronies will
be trapped and wiped out.

187
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,621
I honestly couldn't care less
about who's gonna win this war.

188
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,690
But watching Whitebeard die?

189
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,891
That's fun!

190
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:28,595
Pops and Ace won't die--
not while I'm around!

191
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:40,607
Shall we put this
match on hold, Vista?

192
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:45,913
Much as I hate to, we do have
other matters to worry about.

193
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,514
[PIRATES gasping]

194
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,850
[PIRATES yelling]

195
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,653
We've gotta back down.

196
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:57,023
So, let's go, Smoker!
Didn't you hear the orders?

197
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:02,495
Yeah... I heard 'em.

198
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,099
[SMOKER]
Next time, Straw Hat!

199
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:16,042
Luffy, you can do it.
Stay strong.

200
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,648
[SENGOKU growls]

201
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,751
Why the hell hasn't
the video feed been cut?

202
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:26,921
[MARINE D] Sorry, sir!
It'll just be another minute!

203
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,589
Hey! Have you found it?

204
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:29,923
[MARINE FF]
Uh, no!

205
00:16:29,957 --> 00:16:33,026
We're still searching,
but it's just gone missing!

206
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,896
[PRISONER AA]
We're all set!

207
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,532
[PRISONER BB] Hey, Gaffer,
you're blockin' the shot.

208
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:42,136
It seems like they've cut all
the camera feeds except for one.

209
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,472
But what's with this stupid
message--just show us already!

210
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:50,877
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL humming]

211
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,550
[PRISONER CC]
The camera's good to go.

212
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,819
[PRISONER C]
Okay then. We're going live...

213
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:04,291
...in five, four,
three, two, one. Action!

214
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,427
Hey! It came back on!

215
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,564
[PRISONER A]
So... Um. Ahem.

216
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:14,101
Uh, sorry. We apologize
for keeping you waiting.

217
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,036
Wait, who is that talking?

218
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,173
[PRISONER A] Uhh.
We're live here at Marineford,

219
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,610
surrounded by the dead bodies
of pirates and marines.

220
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,578
They're doing a commentary?

221
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,046
[gasps]

222
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,450
Hey! What's going on down there?
What is this feed?

223
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,686
[PRISONER A] Wait...
Is that who I think it is?

224
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,457
Oh! It is!
I can't believe it's him!

225
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,293
He's been laying low
for all these years, but

226
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,228
he was a member
of the legendary crew

227
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:45,165
that served under Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates!

228

[CROWD]
Huh?

229
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,534
Who is it?

230
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,536
[PRISONER A] Can it really
be the renowned pirate,

231
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,871
Captain Buggy?

232
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:51,905
[BUGGY]
Huh?

233
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:56,009
I'm sorry,
did someone say my name?

234
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:56,576
Huh?

235
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,980
[CROWD]
Huh...?

236
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:03,250
It is classified information,
but I admit it--

237
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,953
I am the legendary pirate...

238
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:08,856
[PRISONER A whispering] Hey!
Hold it, Captain Buggy! Stop!

239
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,824
You've got a nosebleed!

[BUGGY yelling]

242
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,231
Cut now! Stand by!

243
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,100
Get a hankie, dammit!

244
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:21,602
[SENGOKU]
What the hell is happening here?

245
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,537
How many times have
I ordered you fools

246
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,939
to cut the stupid video?

247
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,609
We can't move with
the world watching!

248
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,144
I understand, sir!

249
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,546
But I'm afraid that the escaped
prisoners have somehow managed

250
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,649
to steal one of the video
transponder snails from us!

251
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,818
What?! How did you
let this happen?

252

mark it! Take two!

In three, two, one, and...

[PRISONER A]
Oh! Is that who I think it is?

257
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,733
The legendary crewmember
of Gold Roger and

258
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,538
the sworn brother of Shanks,
of the Four Emperors?

259
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,776
Could it really be the
mythical pirate, Captain Buggy?

260
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,544
Did someone say my name?

[PRISONER A] I just saw
you get sliced in half by

the infamous "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk,

00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,595

a scratch on you!

getting video of this moron?

we're gonna miss the execution!

we know that Ace is safe!

Hm?

Oh, Squard.
Good to see you're alive.

286
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,407
[SQUARD]
Yeah, barely.

287
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,911
[WHITEBEARD] Is that so? I was
trying to reach you earlier.

288
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,413
How're things lookin'
at the bay head now?

289
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:50,550
I'm sorry to say, but your
allies were beaten pretty badly.

290
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,387
As for me, I only managed to get
out of there through sheer luck.

291
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,290
[WHITEBEARD] Sengoku is
one merciless bastard.

292
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,360
He's pulling out every
dirty trick he can think of.

293
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,262
Judging by your shift in tactic,

294
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:05,432
I'm guessing you
picked up on the Navy's plan.

295
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,934
[WHITEBEARD]
I've known Sengoku

296
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:09,769
and what he's capable
of for a long time.

297
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,444
I see.

298
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,979
[WHITEBEARD]
Little does he know,

299
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:22,249
it works in our favor for them
to attack us from the rear.

300
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,684
I'm joining the fight.

301
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:26,586
Our only chance is
to keep pushing forward.

I couldn't agree more.

303

Huh?

304
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,360
What's Squard doing up there?

305
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:37,264
You have 43 allied captains
willing to die for you.

306
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:41,134
We're all in your debt,
for now and for always.

307
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:42,470
We consider it a privilege

308
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,805
to risk our lives
for you and your crew.

00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:54,781
And I'm grateful,
but this fight is--

311
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:59,552
Yes, I know. This fight is
to save a member of your family.

312
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,288
The great pirate
Whitebeard is a man

313
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,057
who would do anything
for his family.

314
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,894
And your loyalty
inspires loyalty.

315
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,863
That's why everyone
followed you to this hell.

316
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,032
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

317
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,336
I do wish things were different.

318
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,373
[SQUARD]
But at the end of the day...

319
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:25,279
[SQUARD] ...I'm not
a part of your family.

[NARRATOR] After witnessing
Squard's betrayal

323
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:18,199
against Whitebeard, ripples of
distrust and uncertainty

324
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,766
spread within his alliance.

325
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,135
And yet Whitebeard's faith
will not be shattered.

326
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,838
And it soon becomes clear
that his allies are falling

327
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,574
into a clever setup,
launched by the Navy.

328
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,310
