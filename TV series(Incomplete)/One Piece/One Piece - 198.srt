1
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,749
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,208
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,878
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,546
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,050
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,347
[NARRATOR]
The Going Merry fell right into

25
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:33,184
the middle of the invincible
Marine fortress, Navarone.

26
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,189
[NARRATOR] But luckily,
Luffy and the others

27
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,067
managed to escape
under cover of night.

28
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:45,905
{\an8}[NARRATOR] Nami successfully
disguised herself as a janitor,

29
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:48,908
while Luffy and Sanji
infiltrated the kitchen.

30
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:50,827
Murray?

31
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,995
So you're here.

32
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:54,456
[NARRATOR]
However, one of the crew, Zoro,

33
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:57,459
was captured by
their Marine foes.

34
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,544
[JONATHAN]
Welcome to Navarone.

35
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,595
[LUFFY] "Captured Zoro!
Chopper's Emergency Operations!"

36
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:17,771
[JONATHAN]
One down, six to go.

37
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,814
The infamous Roronoa Zoro,

38
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:22,442
one of Luffy's
Straw Hat Pirates.

39
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,570
Drake, go to the brig and
interrogate the prisoner.

40
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,364
But, Commander, my team and I

41
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:28,656
are already under
orders from you

42
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,784
to surveil and secure
the dining hall.

43
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,285
[JONATHAN]
Huh? You are?

44
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:34,829
You told me that pirates
are always hungry.

45
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,332
So sooner or later they'll
show up at the mess hall.

46
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:38,792
[JONATHAN]
I'll handle the mess hall.

47
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,294
Things are bound to be a
little screwy around there.

48
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,295
Jessica told me they got

49
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:44,339
some new cooks
from headquarters.

50
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:48,843
And how shall I conduct
Zoro's interrogation?

51
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,762
[JONATHAN]
I'll leave that up to you.

52
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,358
[yawns]

53
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:04,693
Oh, come on,

54
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:06,611
are you guys just gonna
sit there and stare at me?

55
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:26,256
Well, nothing to do but
get some more shuteye.

56
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,801
[ZORO snores]

57
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:32,721
[DRAKE]
Open the cell.

58
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,180
But, Lieutenant Commander!

59
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,391
The prisoner is
extremely dangerous.

60
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,893
[DRAKE] I am under direct orders
from Vice Admiral Jonathan

61
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,854
to interrogate the prisoner.

62
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:43,064
[MARINE AB] Yes, sir!
Please be careful, sir!

63
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,860
[cell door opens]

64
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,194
[ZORO]
Hm?

65
00:04:48,278 --> 00:04:50,447
Roronoa Zoro.

66
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,991
Known far and wide
as a pirate hunter,

67
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,159
until you turned traitor

68
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,494
and joined the scum
you used to hunt.

69
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,288
[ZORO] You didn't come
all the way down here

70
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,248
just to tell me that, did you?

71
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:02,417
If that's how you
want to play it.

72
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,918
How many of you are there?

73
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,963
And what exactly is your purpose
in invading this fortress?

74
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,256
It was a clever strategy

75
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,551
to invade a base like
this from the sky.

76
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,803
How did you do it?
Did you build a launch pad?

77
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,139
Nope, we just came
down from the sky.

78
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,640
[DRAKE]
Don't mock me!

79
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,809
Calm down, big guy,
I'm not mocking you.

80
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,103
I'm just answering
your question.

81
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,856
I won't hear any more
of your lies, pirate!

82
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,233
Like I said, we came
down from the sky.

83
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:28,526
If you want to get specific,

84
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,196
we rode down on a
floating octopus.

85
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,573
Are you happy now?

86
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:37,494
Well, I guess we'll have
to do this the hard way.

87
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:40,080
You're gonna be sorry!

88
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,665
[groaning]

89
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:46,127
I'll find out the truth,
no matter what!

90
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:00,975
[CHIEF CLEANER]
Your next assignment

91
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,144
is to clean the old gym.

92
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,854
[NAMI]
Aye aye, boss!

93
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,823
Clean all this?

94
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:22,330
[NAMI]
And I gotta do it... by myself?

95
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,127
[CHIEF CLEANER]
I wanna see it sparkle!

96
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,922
Boy, I'd hate to be in your
shoes right now! [laughs]

97
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,217
This disguise was
clearly a mistake.

98
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:38,430
[MARINE A]
I heard that they captured

99
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,306
one of the Straw Hat Pirates.

100
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,934
[MARINE B] What, then that
wasn't a ghost ship?

101
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,145
[MARINE A] No, but this
guy is scarier than a ghost.

102
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:48,648
You're not gonna believe this,
but they caught Roronoa Zoro!

103
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,649
[MARINE B, MARINE AC]
Whoa!

104
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,817
[CHOPPER]
What?

105
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,735
[MARINE A]
And apparently there are other

106
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,319
crewmembers hidin', too.

107
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:55,905
Imagine, if we found even
one of them, we'd be heroes!

108
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,073
[MARINE B, MARINE C]
Yeah!

109
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,034
[CHOPPER]
Zoro got captured!

110
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,077
What do I do now?

111
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,082
[CHOPPER gasps]

112
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,417
Those Marines back there

113
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,128
didn't mention anyone else
being taken prisoner.

114
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,713
So the rest of the
crew has got to be

115
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:12,839
around here somewhere.

116
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,299
But where could they be?

117
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,926
This place is huge!
I'm so ready to get outta here!

118
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,554
--[MARINE AC] Hey, what's that?
--[CHOPPER gasps]

119
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,639
[NAMI]
If I keep that up,

120
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:24,684
I'll be dead before
they catch me!

121
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:26,019
[MARINE AC]
Hold it!

122
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:29,230
Help me! Help!

123
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,940
[MARINE AC]
I said hold it!

124
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:37,447
I guess those guys weren't
looking for me. [sighs]

125
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,656
Cleaning sucks.

126
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,909
Gotta find a new disguise.

127
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:43,286
Well look at that.

128
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,165
[CHOPPER panting]

129
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,875
[CHOPPER]
Oh, no! A dead end!

130
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,502
[MARINE AC]
He went that way!

131
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:51,503
[MARINE AD]
All right, fellas!

132
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,046
The corner is raccoon dogged.

133
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,839
I mean, the raccoon dog
is cornered!

134
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,258
What do I do? What do I do?

135
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,265
[MARINE AC]
He disappeared!

136
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,435
[MARINE AD] A magical
disappearing raccoon dog.

137
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,522
[MARINE AC]
Hmm...

138
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,649
He didn't disappear.

139
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:22,617
[MARINE AE] It'll take forever
to find him in here!

140
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,290
--[MARINE AD] Hey!
--[MARINE AC] Shh.

141
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:38,383
--What do we got here?
--Yeah. Ready or not!

142
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,634
[ALL gasp]

143
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,345
[MARINE AD]
What's going on?

144
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,181
[MARINE AE] Did the raccoon dog
leave his antlers behind?

145
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,225
[MARINE AC] I don't know,
but you can't make tasty treats

146
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:48,518
with antlers.

147
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:49,894
Let's go.

148
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,940
[MARINE AC] We must've
lost him in those hallways.

149
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:00,196
[sighs] Safe at last.

150
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,490
[gasps]

151
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,202
So where's the crate?

152
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:07,579
Should be over here.

153
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:09,539
[CLERK A]
Ahh. There it is.

154
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, what are they
doing with deer antlers?

155
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,544
I think they're
used in medicines.

156
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,716
[MARINE E]
What happened to them?

157
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,176
[MARINE F]
They said they ran into a storm.

158
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,469
Took a lot of casualties.

159
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,636
Hurry it up!

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,805
[MARINE G]
Get them to the infirmary, stat!

161
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,440
Let's see. Make a vertical
incision with the scalpel

162
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,942
and if it begins to bleed...

163
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,365
Blood, blood, blood!

164
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:02,092
Ugh, it's just my luck
that all the other doctors

165
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,010
got called away at once!

166
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:07,138
Oh, please don't let there be
any surgery patients today!

167
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:07,972
[CLERK A]
Doctor!

168
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,599
[KOBATO gasps]
Yes?

169
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,059
We brought the crate
of deer antlers

170
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:13,353
for the medicine
you're going to make.

171
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:14,604
Of course.

172
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,606
Right over there will be fine.

173
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,732
[CLERK A]
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,446
[CHOPPER]
Where am I?

175
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,867
[gasps]

176
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:32,163
[NAMI humming]

177
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,666
I look pretty good in this,
if I do say so myself,

178
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,043
and I bet the work
won't be near-- [gasps]

179
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,463
[gasps] I'm so sorry!

180
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:41,798
What are you apologizing for?

181
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:43,550
Just get to the
infirmary already!

182
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,093
What? Where? Huh?

183
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,219
[NURSE B]
There's been an emergency.

184
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,138
All nurses are to
report immediately!

185
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:51,266
I knew it! I'm screwed
no matter what disguise I pick!

186
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,309
Doctor, we have an emergency!

187
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:56,354
So, what kind of
emergency is this?

188
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,273
[NURSE A] Critically injured
sailors from the Stan Marey

189
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,150
need immediate attention!

190
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,402
Um, well, I'll leave
these patients to you

191
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,571
since that isn't my
area of expertise.

192
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,656
This isn't really
your expertise?

193
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,116
Well last time I checked,

194
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,201
you're the only doctor on
this entire base right now!

195
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,078
[KOBATO]
But--I'm just a pediatrician!

196
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:13,872
I don't know anything
about trauma!

197
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:16,916
That's outside of my specialty!

198
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,588
I see. It's a medical room.

199
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:24,966
But I wonder if that doctor
can handle those patients.

200
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,691
[MARINE G, NURSE A, NURSE B]
One, two, three!

201
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,575
Wow, these guys are all
in really rough shape.

202
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:53,036
Did they get hit by a cyclone?

203
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,038
Don't just stand there,
treat the wounded!

204
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,206
Right!

205
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,086
[NAMI] I don't have time to be
playing nurse with this bunch!

206
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:03,546
I need to be searching
for the Going Merry

207
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,216
so I can get us
outta this place!

208
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:08,635
[MARINE H groans]

209
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:09,969
Oh, I'm sorry!

210
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,846
[NURSE A]
Don't just stand there!

211
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,683
[NURSE B]
Doctor, what do we do?

212
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,017
Okay, let's see.

213
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,395
Painkiller--he needs 50
milligrams of painkiller.

214
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,021
[NURSE C]
Shall we prep the O.R.?

215
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,525
That's right, operate.
I have to operate...

216
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,991

Doctor!

217
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,952

We don't have time for this!

219
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:36,788
[NURSE A]
Tell us what to do!

220
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,289
[NURSE B]
Doctor! Doctor, please!

221
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,416
You've got to wake up.

00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:40,709
[NURSE C]
Ma'am, are you okay?

223
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,377
I gotta help!

224
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:45,296
[CHOPPER] I'll be
directing treatment today!

225
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,589
[NURSES]
Huh?

226
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,094
[CHOPPER] First, administer
this patient a dose of

227
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:54,472
both phenicol and cardiotonic,
then prepare some tialcillin.

228
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,392
Respond if you understand!

229
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,309
[NURSE B, NURSE A]
Yes, Doctor.

230
00:12:58,393 --> 00:12:59,728
Yes, Doctor!

231
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:07,277
Now cross-match every
patient's blood type!

232
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,361
Begin pre-op treatment

233
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:10,697
for everyone who
requires an operation!

234
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:13,992
Get this patient on antibiotics
to treat tetanus

235
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:16,286
and any other infections
he may have!

236
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,579
[NURSE A]
Right!

237
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,205
What's the status of the O.R.?

238
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,915
The operating room
is ready, sir!

239
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,083
[CHOPPER]
Then move patients there!

240
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,877
Start with those in
critical condition!

241
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,086
[NURSE C]
Yes, sir!

242
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:37,682
C'mon. Snap out of it.

243
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:38,516

244
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,642
Nami?

245
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,269
What in the world
are you doing here?

246
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,730
[NAMI]
I should be asking you that!

247
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:46,733
Excuse me, but could you
tell me what's going on?

248
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,194
Where is everyone?
I seem to have fainted.

249
00:13:49,277 --> 00:13:51,988
Wait. You're a doctor!

250
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,074
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

251
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,367
but I'm glad you came along.

252
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,036
You sure saved us with
your expert instructions.

253
00:13:58,119 --> 00:13:59,954
No one's saved yet, Doctor.

254
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:00,914
What?

255
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,791
The situation doesn't look good.

256
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:05,543
Without emergency surgery,
many will die.

257
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:06,795
Yeah.

258
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:08,338
There's no time to lose.

259
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,216
You must operate on the
critically injured now!

260
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:14,427
Yes. Operate. [chuckles]

261
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:17,055
[NAMI]
Hey, what's with you?

262
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:19,808
[KOBATO]
I-I can't do it.

263
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,685
Do what?

264
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,187
[KOBATO] I can't stand
to see people in pain

265
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,564
or bleeding or worse.

266
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,609
Honestly I can barely
even administer a shot.

267
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,444
So the thought of
putting stitches in,

268
00:14:31,528 --> 00:14:33,113
or cutting someone is just...

269
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,614
Oh, just perfect!

270
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,157
This is a Marine base, you know.

271
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:38,118
How can you call yourself
a military doctor

272
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,662
if you can't stand the
sight of a little blood?

273
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,498
My field of practice is
children's medicine.

274
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:46,167
All the other doctors were
called away on business.

275
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:49,087
You see, I was only left in
charge as temporary substitute.

276
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,422
Temporary?

277
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,840
[CHOPPER]
Substitute or not,

278
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:54,718
you're in charge of the
infirmary right now, aren't you?

279
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,095
Uh, yeah, seems so.

280
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:58,680
It seems so?

281
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:01,683
Hey, Chopper, don't you think
it's time we get out of here?

282
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:02,934
Yeah, but...

283
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:04,519
I found out that
this isn't a lake.

284
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,104
It's connected to
the open ocean.

285
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,522
We just have to find
the Going Merry

286
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,649
and we can escape from
this stupid fortress!

287
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:10,942
[CHOPPER]
I can't go yet!

288
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,485
Huh?

289
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:15,447
You're a doctor. It's your duty
to preserve life, isn't it?

290
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,407
That is what I have sworn to do.

291
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,367
But still. I have limits.

292
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,245
Even the best doctors have
things they just can't do.

293
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:23,538
[CHOPPER]
The man who taught me medicine

294
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,457
used to tell me a story.

295
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:30,003
[CHOPPER] There once was a man
who was told by his doctors

296
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,505
that he would soon be dead.

297
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,050
In despair, he wandered
the wilderness

298
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,469
in search of a place to die.

299
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,846
Then as he walked
through a mountain pass,

300
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,599
he saw something extraordinary.

301
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:46,978
The entire mountain was covered
in brilliant cherry blossoms.

302
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:49,272
[CHOPPER]
After seeing this,

303
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,232
he went to visit
his physicians again,

304
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,443
where they were
astounded to report

305
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:56,196
that the man was now
completely healthy.

306
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,032
You are the only doctor for
those patients in there!

307
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:02,118
You alone can save them
from a terrible death!

308
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:04,120
A healer must never give up!

309
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,831
There is no illness
that can't be cured!

310
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't ever let your
fear limit you!

311
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:12,504
There is no patient that we
doctors shouldn't try to cure!

312
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:14,631
[KOBATO gasps]

313
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:17,467
As doctors, we have the power
to make miracles happen!

314
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,886
We have to always believe that!

315
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,263
[KOBATO]
Then...

316
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,685
[KOBATO]
Will I...

317
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,438
...be able to see the
cherry blossoms, too?

318
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,441
No. I will show them
the cherry blossoms.

319
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,944
All of those suffering people
in the operating room.

320
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,488
That's the spirit!
I'll even stick around to help!

321
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:41,658
[NAMI] Hey! We don't
have time for this!

322
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,201
Yes, that may be true.

323
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,454
But my first priority always has
to be helping those in need!

324
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,415
I'm a doctor, Nami!

325
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,627
If that's your decision, then
I'll have to leave you behind.

326
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,838
Is that really what you want?

327
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,465
Doctor, the operating room
is prepped and ready to go!

328
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,134
[CHOPPER]
Good! I'm on my way!

329
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:01,803
Chop--I mean, yes, Doctor!

330
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:08,977
Right, let's go!

331
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,445
Hey, Chopper!

332
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,113
[CHOPPER] You can leave me
behind if you need to,

333
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,489
but I have to stay.

334
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,699
If I didn't, I'd be abandoning

335
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:25,285
everything Doctrine
taught me to uphold.

336
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:31,082
Jeez! Well I'm not just gonna
leave you here all by yourself!

337
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,067
Just who in the
heck is that guy?

338
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:01,696
[KOBATO] We'll start with
the critical cases.

339
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,115
There's a large iron shard
lodged in his upper torso

340
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,408
that must be extracted.

341
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,035
The patient has
been anesthetized,

342
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,620
so we are ready to
begin the procedure.

343
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:10,747
--Scalpel.
--Yes, Doctor.

344
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,921
Dr. Kobato, you'll be fine.

345
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,381
Remember, you are the only one

346
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,217
who can show these patients
the cherry blossoms.

347
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,510
[KOBATO]
Yes.

348
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,351
This incision runs close to
an artery, so be careful.

349
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,644
[KOBATO]
Right.

350
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,315
Nami, suction.

351
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,692
[NAMI]
Yes, Doctor.

352
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:50,620
[CHOPPER]
The shard has been removed.

353
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:51,996
--Done!
--Dr. Kobato,

354
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,581
we're not even close to done.

355
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,000
There are so many more patients.

356
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,042
[KOBATO]
Of course.

357
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,961
We can do it.

358
00:18:58,044 --> 00:18:59,462
[KOBATO]
Yeah.

359
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:00,714
[DRAKE]
What?

360
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,341
An unidentified doctor
is performing surgery?

361
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,218
[MARINE I]
Yes, sir!

362
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:08,888
That could be our second
Straw Hat of the day.

363
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:10,265
[ZORO]
Chopper.

364
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,853
[DRAKE]
Pardon the intrusion!

365
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,731
[KOBATO]
We're operating. Please leave!

366
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:20,066
This is urgent! I assure you.

367
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,818
I need to ask you
a few questions.

368
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,738
[NAMI] Doctor, his blood
pressure is dropping fast!

369
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,949
[CHOPPER] Give him six
units of saline solution

370
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,909
and one unit of platelets!

371
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:30,910
[NAMI, NURSE B]
Yes, sir!

372
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:34,080
[CHOPPER]
He's out of danger now.

373
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,750
Continue the blood transfusion
and ready the dopamine!

374
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:39,919
[DRAKE clears throat]
Dr. Kobato!

375
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,296
[KOBATO] We're in the
middle of an operation!

376
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,256
If you're going to stay,
please be quiet!

377
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,300
Excuse me, did I hear you right?

378
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:46,885
You're performing surgery?

379
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:51,014
The doctor that nearly faints
every time she sees a paper cut?

380
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,600
There are reports of an
unidentified doctor here.

381
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,060
[KOBATO]
Get out!

382
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,603
Huh?

383
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:58,563
[KOBATO] The only thing you and
your thugs will find in here

384
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,732
are people giving their all
to save precious lives!

385
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:02,275
Is that clear?

386
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:09,532
Let's go!

387
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:12,285
[DRAKE]
Monitor them.

388
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:13,411
[MARINE I]
Sir!

389
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,185
[KOBATO]
Suture completed.

390
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,479
[NURSE B] That was the
last of our patients.

391
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,526
[NAMI]
Good job, Dr. Kobato.

392
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,362
[KOBATO sighs]

393
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,322
No, Chopper, don't!

394
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:52,117
[CHOPPER]
You really are a great doctor!

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,703
Thank you. But you're
a much better doctor

396
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,871
than I'll ever be,
Mr. Raccoon Dog.

397
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,415
You stupid face!

398
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:01,835
I'm not a raccoon dog,
I'm a reindeer!

399
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:03,253
[NAMI] It's like she
doesn't even notice

400
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:05,714
that Chopper just changed shape!

401
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,094
[JONATHAN humming]

402
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:15,140
[SANJI] Really, what are we
still doing hanging around here?

403
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:18,643
We don't even know if Robin and
Nami are out of harms way.

404
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,896
[SANJI] Ahh. But I can't
just abandon a task

405
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,399
that the lovely Jessica gave me!

406
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,026
Got that right.

407
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,986
What are you doing, you idiot?

408
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,279
Uh, I don't know.

409
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,197
Have you seen how awesome
this glow thing is?

410
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,074
Yes, I've seen how
awesome your thing is.

411
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,368
Now help me or figure out
how to get us out of here.

412
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:36,870
Oh, yeah.

413
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,830
How come we're still sitting
around this stupid kitchen?

414
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:40,749
We're still here because
you haven't figured out

415
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,042
a way for us to escape!

416
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,001
Hey, Sanji?

417
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,210
What now?

418
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,879
Do you think someone
could eat a raw octopus?

419
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,881
What does that have
to do with anything?

420
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:49,090
[JESSICA]
How's it coming?

421
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,468
Are you done yet?
If you don't hurry,

422
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,720
we won't be ready for
the next hundred soldiers.

423
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:55,638
Oh, my sweet Jessica!

424
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:57,599
I just finished the onions!

425
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,560
Well, looks like it's just
about break time. I'm beat!

426
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,437
[SANJI] But you haven't
done anything yet!

427
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,688
Since you're so eager to help,

428
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,775
I've got another 300
onions here for you!

429
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,694
More? You gotta be kidding me!

430
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:13,865
I am ever your humble
servant, sweet Jessica!

431
00:22:13,948 --> 00:22:16,409
Hey, I think I know why
we're stuck in the kitchen.

432
00:22:16,493 --> 00:22:18,661
And it's all your fault!

433
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:39,557
<i>A future lies before us</i>

434
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,769
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

435
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:46,981

440
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,584
<i>We're running, and running,</i>

441
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:09,587

448
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,581
[ZORO] That little game
of 20 questions sure hurt,

449
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,458
but I'm more worried
about the others!

450
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:48,126
Usopp, is our ship okay?

451
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,836
Robin, what's with that outfit?

452
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,213
Nevermind the captain
and that idiot cook!

453
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,840
Looks like the tide
is about to turn.

454
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:55,633
On the next One Piece!

455
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,594
[LUFFY]
Don't steal my line!

456
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,262
On the next One Piece!

457
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:03,391
"The Marine's Dragnet Closes In!
The Second Member Captured!"

458
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,268
[ZORO]
I'm gonna be a great swordsman!

459
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:06,728
[LUFFY]
Hey!
