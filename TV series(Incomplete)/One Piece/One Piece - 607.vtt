00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.708
â™ª Opening Song

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.531
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.434
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:46.639
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.175
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.445
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.280
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.683
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.719
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.023
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.658
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.395
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.666
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:18.671
[NARRATOR] After a
series of fierce battles,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.540
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:24.244
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.579
Their first stop is the
island of Punk Hazard,

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.216
where they face off against the
mad scientist, Caesar Clown.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.452
When he unleashes a
terrifying weapon known as

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:36.189
"Land of the Dead,"
the Straw Hats barely survive.

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.526
Ready for a counterattack,
they team up with Trafalgar Law

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.061
and launch an assault
on Caesar's lab.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.663
Their hope is to
fight their way through

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.099
to the only exit off the island.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:49.369
But in another part of the lab,
Vice Admiral Vergo

00:02:49.402 --> 00:02:52.672
suddenly appears before
Tashigi's Navy unit.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.141
Captain Tashigi!
We're saved at last!

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.111
The big guns have arrived
to provide us some back up!

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:01.281
We got two Vice Admirals
on our side now!

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.490
[TASHIGI]
Vergo!

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.669
[MARINE U]
Vice Admiral Smokey and Vergo?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:26.906
The G-5 is finally
ready to kick some ass!

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.275
[MARINE T] Ain't no one
gonna stop us now!

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.410
Oh, no.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:34.080
[MARINE V]
Hell yeah! Caesar's goin' down!

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.014
[TASHIGI]
Run.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.583
Everyone.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.618
Run now!

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.499
Uh, Vice Admiral Vergo?

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:55.168
Did those soldiers
do somethin' wrong?

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.369
Even if they did...

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.837
I'm all for punishment
and everything,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.872
but your finger pistol
might kill 'em.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.874
[TASHIGI]
Everyone, get back!

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.142
Run for your lives!

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.112
He's not the man
you think he is!

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.413
Listen to me!

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.849
He's been working against--

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.318
--[JERO gasps]
--Captain, no!

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:25.131
Monster! I'm sending
you to hell!

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.699
[PIKE screams]

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.135
[MARINES groan]

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.240
[TASHIGI] My words are
frozen in my throat.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.944
Smoker. Anyone.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:40.046
Please, you have to stop this.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.381
[SANJI]
I hear a lady...

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.115
Who is that?

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.550
[SANJI]
...in need of my help!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.763
I heard the heartbreaking
sound... of a woman's tears.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:02.268
[LUFFY panting]

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.436
You ready?

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.839
[LUFFY] Are you serious?
Gimme a sec! Jeez!

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:10.910
I was running so fast my feet
lit the damn floor on fire!

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:16.382
[pants] I'm starting
to catch my breath.

00:05:16.416 --> 00:05:20.053
Huh? Hey, did you hear me
say I was ready?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.823
Listen up. Vergo's
mine, stay back.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.792
Yeah! I got it!

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.927
And you keep away from Caesar.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.530
I'm the only one
taking down that jerk.

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.603
Oh. Guess I'm up first.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.271
Fine.

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:39.138
Huh?

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:44.410
You're not getting
away now! Caesar!

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:47.613
[CAESAR CLOWN groans]

00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.152
[LUFFY]
"A Fierce Battle Gets Heated!

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.355
Luffy Vs. Caesar!"

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:04.731
[LUFFY yelling]

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.073
[LAW]
Listen, White Hunter.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:18.444
I'm telling ya right now:
keep your distance from Caesar.

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.679
Last thing I need to deal with

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:22.615
is us taking turns squeezing
each other's hearts.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.984
I know you're filled with
hell fire right now,

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:28.087
but save it until I get
my heart back from Vergo.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:32.158
As long as we're on this island,
you're following my orders.

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.526
Got it?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.431
[SMOKER]
I took the shortest route here.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:41.467
And I was moving
as fast as I could.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.239
[SMOKER]
Where are you, Vergo?!

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.549
Dammit, you're
incessantly irritating!

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.651
[LUFFY]
I got you now!

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.987
[LUFFY yelling]

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.155
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Spoke too soon, there.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:04.123
[LUFFY yelling]

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.292
And Flammable Type!

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.666
Huh?

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.868
Miok Gas!

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.036
[LUFFY gasps]

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.743
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Straw Hat!

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.978
[CAESAR CLOWN]
What's your problem?

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:28.748
What reason do you have
for attacking me?

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:30.249
Other than you tryin' to kill me

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.684
and my friends
and everyone else,

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.153
somethin' cool's supposed
to happen if I capture you!

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.588
That sounds to me
like you formed

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.523
some kind of alliance with Law.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:39.525
Trusting him is
an act of foolishness.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.260
Take it from my own experience.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.328
He will betray you!

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.096
Keep your advice!

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.799
I'll do whatever I wanna do!

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.269
You really are a glutton
for pain, aren't you?

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.238
Karakuni!

00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:57.910
[gasps] Ah, crap,
I'm choking again!

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.045
That you are!

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:02.348
Most people do that when
I remove their oxygen!

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:06.786
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles] Are those
pathetic flailings intended to

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.122
hit me, or are they
merely your death throes?

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.762
[groans]

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.936
[pants] So this is the distance!

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.372
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
Yes, you got me.

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.708
My powers are locked
within a set radius.

00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:33.179
The question is, how long can
you stay out of that radius?

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:36.148
You just told me
all I needed to know.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.518
Second Gear!

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.825
Get ready for Gum-Gum...

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:49.095
I'm not giving you the chance!

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:51.464
[LUFFY]
...Jet Pistol!

00:08:51.497 --> 00:08:54.734
[CAESAR CLOWN]
So fast!

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:00.506
[CAESAR CLOWN]
That hurt, you dullard!

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.340
[LUFFY gasps]

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.142
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Although, it allowed me

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.411
to close the distance!

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.512
Not again!

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.847
That looks painful!

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.850
Well, here.
Want your oxygen back?

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.721
Breathe in the Blue Sword!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.994
[panting]

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.430
[cackles]

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.599
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Every gas is a weapon for me!

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:28.801
Maybe I can't kill
you with poison,

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.670
but I've still got
an entire arsenal

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.171
that'll put you in the ground!

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.841
[pants] Man, this is annoying.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.344
I'm gettin' real tired
of not breathing.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:40.479
[cackles]

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:41.581
Dammit!

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.849
[CAESAR CLOWN] Get ready
to be slashed and seared!

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:48.321
All right,
now Gum-Gum... [gasps]

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:50.389
Have some Gastanet!

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:57.997
[LUFFY panting]
Close call.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.500
I'm sending you
to hell, Straw Hat!

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.970
[alarm blaring]

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:05.438
It's the alarm!

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.007
[MARINE C]
The gate's closing!

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.510
We gotta run! Hurry!

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.945
[VERGO]
You're a pirate.

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.914
Why're you helping
a bunch of marines?

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.650
'Cuz you're not supposed
to hurt ladies, scumbag.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.318
If your parents
didn't teach you that,

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:22.388
then I'm the one who's gonna
beat the lesson into your brain.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:26.492
I'm far too busy right now
to field your moral platitudes.

00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:40.206
Ain't that "Black Leg" Sanji?

00:10:40.239 --> 00:10:44.110
I don't get it. What's a
Straw Hat doin' helpin' us?

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.078
He saved my life.

--Holy crap!

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.575
Oh no!

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:20.246
That dragon is not gonna rest
until all of us are barbecue!

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.381
He does look pretty riled up.

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.617
C'mon, Brownie, faster!

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.885
This is my fastest!

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:28.688
Why don't ya get off and
use your own damn legs?

[screams] We're gonna die!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:34.927
Just one breath could roast us.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.063
No one asked for your
academic analysis!

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:39.031
Get up and do something, Brook!

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.032
Huh?

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.767
Yeah, it's all up to you now!

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:42.635
What?

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:44.303
Why are you putting this on me?

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:46.272
I'm scared of
the dragon, too, y'know!

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.541
You're the only one who can
do this, you're oldest!

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.176
Well, then you shouldn't
sacrifice your elders!

Hey, we've got a problem!

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:06.926
[SUBORDINATE B]
What's up?

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.294
The Straw Hats and
most of the Marines

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.296
got through the gates
into Building B!

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:12.765
Wait. Are they getting
close to Building D?

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:13.966
[SUBORDINATE B]
Calm down.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:17.403

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:36.889
Holy crap. That's...

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:41.727
[SUBORDINATE B]
Trafalgar Law!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.364
[SUBORDINATE A] What's going on?
What the hell's he doing here?

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:52.238
It doesn't matter
how he got here!

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:55.374
Let's make the traitor pay!

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:56.876
[LAW]
Room.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:12:58.477
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.612
What?

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.547
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.581
[SUBORDINATE A]
My legs!

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.250
What the heck did you do to me?

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:07.052
Hey! Where are my legs?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.390
You can't avoid me forever!

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:45.558
[gasps]

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.628
[LUFFY]
Will you quit it?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:52.298
You're just itching to die, huh?

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:57.837
[LUFFY pants]
I can breathe again!

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.172
[inhales, gasps]

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:02.942
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.678
[CAESAR CLOWN] Quit running
and give me your breath!

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.983
[cackles] I'm closing
the gap on you!

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.686
Not so easy to run when
you can't breathe, is it?

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:17.289
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:25.097
[cackles] How long do you
think you can run from me?

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:30.035
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
Sit still already!

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:33.539
Wouldn't it be easier on you
if you just let me kill you?

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.507
Oh, man, you suck!

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:38.577
Quit chasing me!

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:41.447
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.890
You obnoxious pest!

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.192
Damn your Haki!

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:57.429
[panting]

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.405
[panting] I've gotta catch 'im
before he sucks my lungs dry.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.341
How do I get close
enough to do it?

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.311
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
Look at that face.

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.847
You're really straining your
little brain, aren't you?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.115
Well, sorry.

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:18.884
Because you're never going to
figure out a way to capture me.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:21.687
Anytime you get close,
I'm just going to keep removing

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.291
all your oxygen until
you finally croak.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:31.130
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles] So.
Please, keep trying to catch me.

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:36.835
[MARINES panting]

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:43.575
It don't look like
Black Leg's gonna back down.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.678
He's beatin' the hell
outta that fake Vergo.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.212
We gotta give 'im
some backup!

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:49.949
What are you morons doing?
Start running already!

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:53.319
They're trying to seal you up
in here to poison you!

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:54.286
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.155
[MARINES gasp]

00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.491
What'd I tell you?

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:00.793
[MARINES scream]

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.628
[MARINES gasping]

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:03.796
They're letting the gas in,

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:06.498
we've gotta run
for it, get a move on!

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:15.507
Well look at that. Now I get it.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:19.445
You've got metal or something
under your skin, don't you?

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.513
Quit interfering.

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.917
This is an internal matter.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.719
I'm familiar with your type.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:29.521
My captain hates guys like you.

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.664
[SANJI]
Aw, crap.

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:48.107
[SANJI]
He's really damn strong!

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.274
Hey, Black Leg!

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.843
Ya gotta run, man!

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.211
The gate's closing!

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.680
You're gonna get
trapped in there!

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:57.216
Turn around, the gas
is right behind you!

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.218
Get out of there!

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:06.925
[SANJI gasps]

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.163
[LUFFY groans]

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:18.103
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles] How long
do you intend to keep this up?

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.439
[CAESAR CLOWN]
According to my math,

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.307
you've only got two options.

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.575
You can walk out of this room

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.677
with your tail tucked
between your legs.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:29.581
Or you can die
by immolation. Ha!

00:17:31.784 --> 00:17:33.619
[CAESAR CLOWN] The entire
point of this experiment

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:35.421
was to demonstrate
for the brokers

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:38.490
the lethal force of
my Land of the Dead.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.128
Killing you in any other manner
defeats the whole purpose.

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:47.499
This is not what I want,
but I will still enjoy it.

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.401
Karakuni!

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.373
Dammit! You suck!

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:57.209
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
I'm giving you one final chance

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.877
to turn around and leave.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:00.746
You do that and--

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:07.719
[LUFFY] I'm not walkin'
away till I catch you.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.956
Ha! Suicidal, aren't you?

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:13.592
[LUFFY]
Go on and take away my air.

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:17.596
One breath's all I need
to kick your gassy ass!

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:20.632
Huh? Well, that's
a rather bold claim.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.568
Armament Hardening!

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:25.604
All right, fine.

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:28.173
Just remember you chose this.

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:32.211
Send me a postcard from hell!

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:35.614
[inhales]

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:36.782
Huh?

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.786
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:43.355
[LUFFY]
This is it!

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:46.425
Gum-Gum... Jet Gatling!

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.330
[LUFFY gasps]
Is that a wall?

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.364
Hey, what the hell?

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:53.599
[MONET]
Igloo!

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.533
[gasps]

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.868
I'm impressed.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.336
There aren't too
many people alive

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:59.805
that could actually
break through this wall.

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:04.510
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:06.979
[LUFFY]
Have you got Devil Fruit powers?

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.116
Dammit! You dumb rubber bastard!

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.586
It's time to go, Master.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.522
This is a pointless fight.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.158
Heh. You're telling me.

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:20.192
We are in the midst of

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.961
a terribly important
demonstration, after all.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:24.863
So what, you're just gonna run?

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.064
Do your worst, Straw Hat.

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.167
I've got bigger fish to fry.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.568
But I'll keep you in my thoughts

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:33.338
when I use your crew as test
subjects for my experiment.

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:36.909
Enjoy your demise! [cackles]

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.011
[LUFFY gasps]
Hang on!

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:41.547
Sorry, but you can't
go after him.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.017
I won't let the Master suffer
any further misfortune.

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.754
Joker would kill me
if I allowed that.

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.657
You mean the pink bird
guy from the war?

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.059
What the hell is
up with that dude?

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:10.776
[alarm blaring]

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.047
[SUBORDINATE D]
Aw jeez, what's happening now?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.915
[SUBORDINATE E]
It's Trafalgar!

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.450
This is way beyond bad.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:21.019
Send out an emergency
broadcast! On the double!

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.287
Right!

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.257
[siren blaring]

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.492
[SUBORDINATE E] This is an
alert from Building D!

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:30.495
Attention all buildings
of the Third Laboratory!

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.097
What now?

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.665
[SUBORDINATE E]
This is Building D!

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:37.135
Attention all buildings
of the Third Laboratory!

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:41.573
The Warlord Trafalgar Law
has infiltrated the premises!

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:46.778
And he's just gained access
to the SAD manufacturing room!

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:50.616
Is he crazy?

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:53.385
What does that fool
think he's doing?

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.887
If he goes through with this,

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:59.658
he's gonna bite off more
than even he can chew!

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.730
So that's it.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.365
That was his plan all along.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.233
[SANJI grunts]

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.737
What the? [gasps]

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:21.280
You capture the Master
while he finds SAD.

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:24.783
Well, I finally see what
your little scheme is.

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:31.890
[SMOKER]
Vergo!

00:21:36.528 --> 00:21:39.498
Law. He formed an alliance
with the Straw Hats

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.433
just to keep us busy.

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.568
And he probably
joined the Warlords

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:46.505
just so he could gain
access to that room.

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.808
[VERGO]
Crazy bastard!

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:53.412
[VERGO] He must have one
seriously hellish scenario

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:56.014
banging around inside his skull.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.818
[VERGO]
And if he succeeds...

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:04.222
[VERGO] ...he'll send
the New World into chaos!

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.638
[NARRATOR]
Trafalgar Law infiltrates

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.073
the SAD production area

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:24.609
and prepares to shake up the
New World in a profound way.

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:27.479
At the same time, the mysterious
Warlord whose been

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.881
pulling the strings of
Punk Hazard from the shadows

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:33.318
finally breaks his silence
and enters the fray.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.853
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:38.924
"A Mastermind Underground!
Doflamingo Makes His Move!"

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:41.727
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
