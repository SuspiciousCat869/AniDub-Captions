Seek freedom and it will lie

00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:00,670
[USOPP] I figured since
I wasn't doing anything anyway,

39
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:03,965
I'd start hauling this wood
over to the ship for repairs.

40
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,675
You're gonna
swim over there, huh?

41
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,052
Yeah.

42
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,804

51
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,003
With Satori gone,
we proved today

52
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,465
that we can defeat
the remaining priests.

53
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,426

We all know why we're here,

get away instead of

you had the chance.

all their pathetic efforts

have left it to me.

could handle it alone.

175
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,200
Why do you mock us?

176
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:29,202
Is that the reason
you summoned us here?

177
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,037
To entertain yourself?

178
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,455
[ENERU]
I was bored.

179
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,416
[chuckles]

180
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,584
Now have a seat.

181
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,378
You don't seem to have
given too much thought

182
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:41,131
to the Blue Sea
dwellers yet, have you?

183
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:44,300
[OHM] God Eneru, if this
is about Satori's failure.

184
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,511
[GEDATSU] That idiot
was too inexperienced.

185
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:50,890
[SHURA] And that ridiculous
Ordeal of Spheres! Ha!

186
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:55,353
You're hardly in
a position to talk, Shura.

187
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,565
Gan Fall still lives.

188
00:10:58,648 --> 00:10:59,607
That's impossible!

189
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:02,777
I tell you I killed
the man myself!

190
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,487
[ENERU]
You injured him, certainly.

191
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,490
But he's far from dead.

192
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:09,868
What's more, he seems
to be hitting it off quite well

193
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,661
with the Blue Sea dwellers.

194
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,747
What a stubborn old man, eh?

195
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,956
[chuckles]

196
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,791
And just what is it
these Blue Sea dwellers

197
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,002
are looking for anyway?

198
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,465
Why, they are looking for gold.

199
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,342
That's obvious.

200
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,010
What, gold?

201
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,012
Impossible. How?

202
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:30,805
How did they know?

203
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,351
[ENERU] This island was
originally part of the Blue Sea.

204
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:37,145
It's not so odd that they
should know about it.

205
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,109
Of course,
they'll move tomorrow.

206
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:45,070
As will the Shandorians.

207
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,323
[ENERU] The rules state that
you each run an area of

208
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,575
the Upper Yard, and you're
not allowed to enter

209
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:54,996
each other's areas or interfere
with one another in any way.

210
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,333
Tomorrow, I'll allow you
to go where you will.

211
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:02,170
You may set up your
ordeals wherever you want.

212
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:04,255
There will be no restrictions.

213
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,758
Get as vicious as you like.

214
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,427
Why are you being
so generous all of a sudden?

215
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,012
Because, my friends.

216
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:15,058
I am pleased to announce that
the Maxim is almost complete.

217
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,810
So it's time
for us to put an end to

218
00:12:16,893 --> 00:12:19,479
this wretched island and
set forth on our journey

219
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,815
to the world of dreams!

220
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:43,420
[GAN FALL] To think that these
children could defeat Satori.

221
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,800
[GAN FALL] They've managed to
set Eneru against them for sure.

222
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,719
And if I know the Shandorians,

223
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:53,722
they won't pass up this
chance for another attack.

224
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,099
[USOPP whimpers]

225
00:12:56,182 --> 00:13:00,854
[GAN FALL] Eneru. I wish I could
figure out what it is you want.

226
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,330
[WYPER]
We did put up a good fight,

227
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:22,751
and today, we will break
into God's Shrine!

228
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,427
[WYPER]
And then... Eneru.

229
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,393
[screams]
It's true! I wasn't dreaming!

230
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:42,520
Someone was here last night!

231
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,114
[STRAW HAT CREW]
The Going Merry!

232
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,241
She's been repaired!

233
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,540
[USOPP]
I knew it!

234
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:05,210
See, guys?
I told you I wasn't insane!

235
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:08,004
[whimpers, sobs]

236
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,589
[NAMI]
I don't believe it.

237
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,091
The mast is fixed.

238
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,343
Hey, now that's service!

239
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:16,888
[ROBIN giggles]
You can say that again.

240
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:18,765
Can you imagine
what a chore it was

241
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:22,310
just to stand something
this heavy upright?

242
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:27,065
Well, I hate to say it,
but they did a lousy job.

243
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,484
Well, whoever
did it sure is nice!

244
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,860
[laughs]

245
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:34,406
[USOPP] There was somebody here.
I knew I saw him!

246
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,866
But who'd risk crossing a
river full of skysharks to come

247
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,245
all the way out here
and fix our ship for us?

248
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:43,039
I mean, as far as we
can tell, the only people here

249
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,750
on Upper Yard are
us and our enemies.

250
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,294
Hey, did you notice
they took all the flying gear

251
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,214
off the ship? That's weird.

252
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:54,718
[USOPP] Hmm... Yeah,
I been thinking about it,

253
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,678
and it's really
got me wondering.

254
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:03,393
Huh. It just doesn't
make any sense to me.

255
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,854
How could this phantom repairman
know what the Merry's supposed

256
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,689
to look like?

257
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,566
How'd he know she
didn't always have a comb,

258
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,652
or wings, or a tail?

259
00:15:12,736 --> 00:15:15,238
[CHOPPER] Who'd you see,
Usopp? Who was it?

260
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,698
I still say he was
partying too hard

261
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,199
and was having a nightmare.

262
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:20,035
[gulps]

263
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:21,828
[CHOPPER grunts, laughs]

264
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,872
[NAMI]
And why are you two goofing off?

265
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,251
There's lots of work to do.
Or did you forget?

266
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:29,544
[ZORO growls]

267
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:32,339
But Nami, aren't you
even a little bit curious?

268
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,299
'Bout what?

269
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:37,427
[CHOPPER] About who fixed the
Going Merry for us, what else?

270
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,012
[NAMI]
Who cares?

271
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,223
If they wrecked it, that'd be
another thing, but it's fixed.

272
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:45,060
What, do you want to track
them down and thank them?

273
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,773
Well, no, but I...

274
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:54,027
[USOPP] Hmm... How could
he possibly have known?

275
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:03,161
C'mon, Merry,
just tell me who I saw.

276
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,630
[BOTH]
Hmm.

277
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,799
Right! Pay close
attention as I,

278
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:18,426
Usopp the Mighty, chief
operating officer of Operation

279
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,387
Get the Going Merry
Off that Stupid Altar,

280
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,472
swing into action!

281
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:25,058
[CHOPPER] I'm assistant chief
operating officer for Operation

282
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:28,144
Get the Going Merry
off that Stupid Altar!

283
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:29,979
Everyone's counting on me!

284
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,567
[NAMI]
Hey, what are you doing?

285
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,611
You got a plan, Usopp?

286
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,698
Heh. Uh...

287
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,949
[USOPP]
All right.

288
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,245
Chopper!

289
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,454
[CHOPPER]
Hmm!

00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,667
[USOPP growls]

291
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:53,878
All right!

292
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,338
Go!

293
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,966
Ha-ha!

00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,763
[STRAW HATS laugh]

295
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,682
Okay, Chopper!
Give 'er all you got!

296
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,309
Awesome! You're awesome, Usopp!

297
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:11,896

301
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,035
[CHOPPER]
It didn't work, Usopp. What now?

302
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,286
[USOPP]
Don't worry about it.

303
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,788
I've devised a cunning
super-secret backup plan

304
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,832
for just such an emergency.

305
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,461
Oh, boy, can you
tell me what it is?

306
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:35,712
[USOPP]
Sure!

307
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,882
This river is full of
huge skysharks, right?

308
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:42,385
I'll say!
There's swarms of them!

309
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:46,681
[USOPP grunts]
So what if we used their power?

310
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,267
The sharks' power? Yeah!

311
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,896
That's a great idea, Usopp!
They've got lots of power!

312
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,940
[USOPP] Thanks, Chopper! 'Cause
I've got a little job for you!

Just name it!

You can count on me!
I'll do anything!

Did I miss something?

No, no, you're
doing great, keep it up!

322
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,970

[CHOPPER wails]

349
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,335
[sighs]

350
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:46,760
All right!

351
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:48,303
--Okay, Usopp!
--Atta way, Usopp!

352
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,680
--You're the best, way to go!
--You show 'em, buddy! Yeah!

353
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:53,266
That's the way you get
a ship off a stupid altar!

354
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,102
[laughs]

355
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:59,147
[CHOPPER whimpers]

356
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:08,031
[shrieks]

357
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,746
[NAMI]
Okay, let's look at the map.

358
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:19,084
The exploration team will be
taking this route moving south.

359
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,627
There should be
some old ruins near

360
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,128
the skull's right eye.

361
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:25,131
Keep an eye out for enemies
and bring back that gold!

362
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,342
[ZORO]
Heh. You make it sound so easy.

363
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,803
[ROBIN] I'm looking forward
to investigating those ruins!

364
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,930
Hold on, you're the one
who keeps talking about gold

365
00:20:32,013 --> 00:20:33,765
and more gold,
but you're not coming?

366
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:36,226
Well, of course not--
it's way too scary!

367
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:37,560
[CHOPPER]
She wants the gold,

368
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,688
but she doesn't want
to risk anything to get it?

369
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,523
That's just too weird!

370
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,066
Did you say something?

371
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:44,943
[CHOPPER whimpers]

372
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:48,196
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh...

373
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,490
[NAMI] We'll be in danger,
too, you know.

374
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:54,244
We'll be taking the Merry
down river through the island.

375
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,705
Then, we'll head for
the beach near the ruins

376
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,790
as fast as possible.

377
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,875
[NAMI]
We can meet up here.

378
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,295
And then we can escape
this stupid sky island!

379
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:07,549
At long last, we'll be a rich
and powerful pirate crew!

380
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:09,009
Able to buy anything!

381
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:12,345
Oh, yeah!
All the meat I can eat!

382
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,181
[USOPP]
Escape. That sounds great!

383
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,100
[CHOPPER]
Just don't make me the bait!

384
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,311
[USOPP]
Look! The weather's perfect!

385
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,105
[SANJI] Sure, we're
on top of the clouds.

386
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,774
[ZORO] Okay! We'll all meet
safely on the east coast!

387
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:27,110
--[USOPP] You bet!
--[LUFFY] Let's get going, then!

388
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:28,737
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

389
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:38,371
[GEDATSU growls]

390
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:02,187
[SHURA] Who will fall
before my Ordeal of String?

391
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,815
The Shandorians or
the Blue Sea dwellers?

392
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:14,282
[ENERU]
And so the festival begins.

393
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:18,161
Magnificent.
Today will be a great day.

394
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:22,999
[yawns]

395
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:38,807
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

396
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,271
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

397
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:48,191
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

398
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:50,944
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

399
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:54,823
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

400
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,869
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

401
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,790
<i>We will never yield</i>

402
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,667
<i>We won't back down</i>

403
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,962
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

404
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

405
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:18,930
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

406
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,350
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

407
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:30,233
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

408
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,289
[LUFFY]
Okay! Let's go get that gold!

409
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,707
[NAMI]
I'm counting on you!

410
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,002
Once we have that gold,
we'll finally be rich pirates!

411
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:50,295
[ZORO] Looks like things
are about to start

412
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,880
getting interesting!

413
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,007
[LUFFY] Bring it on, sky island,
we can handle all you've got!

414
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,550
[CHOPPER]
You guys are the greatest!

415
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:57,635
You can count on me
to do my best!

416
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,429
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

417
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:03,683
"A Giant Snake Bears Its Fangs!
The Survival Game Begins!"

418
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,269
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
