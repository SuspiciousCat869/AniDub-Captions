00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.903
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.719
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.524
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.832
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.334
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.286
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:17.328
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:19.265
the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.235
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:25.077
and launched an attack
on Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:28.383
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.155
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.095
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:35.665
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:38.169
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:41.711
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:44.348
Now, the fate of Dressrosa
will be decided

00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:48.489
in a one-on-one duel between
Luffy and Doflamingo.

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:57.675
[LUFFY]
Muscle Balloon!

00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:16.445
Fourth Gear!

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:26.733
Bounce-Man!

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.308
Now, my Gum-Gum...

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.914
...Kong...

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:37.387
...Gun!

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:52.652
[LUFFY]
Rhino Schneider!

00:04:53.386 --> 00:04:54.789
[DOFLAMINGO]
Athlete!

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:04.042
[DOFLAMINGO] Even with the
armor, he's still like rubber!

00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.514
Not now!

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.049
[DOFLAMINGO]
Damn it!

00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:11.255
Enough! Eat this!

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:14.662
And now, Gum-Gum...

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.104
...Culverin!

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:21.710
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:33.968
Please, listen well. It is I,

00:05:34.035 --> 00:05:39.178
King--rather, former king,
Riku Doldo the Third.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:42.151
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:43.320
[TOWNSMAN O]
What's going on?

00:05:43.387 --> 00:05:45.357
[DOLDO]
The feared Don Quixote Family,

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:47.094
whom we believed
were unstoppable,

00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:50.868
have nearly been eliminated
by a group of mighty warriors

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:54.643
who only happened to be
passing through our country!

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.949
None of the Executives
are left standing!

00:05:58.016 --> 00:05:59.251
Whoa, really?

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:01.957
[DOLDO]
The final obstacle is him!

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:05.732
The ruthless tyrant who has
Dressrosa under his thumb.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.401
Doflamingo!

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:10.340
And the brave soul
who's doing battle with him

00:06:10.407 --> 00:06:13.413
is Luffy of the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.983
I believe he'll save us.

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:17.822
He'll destroy this Birdcage
once and for all!

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.431
That win, or lose,
it'll end in mere minutes!

00:06:22.498 --> 00:06:24.669
Our dear country
may be crumbling,

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:27.441
but I cannot allow you
to go down with it!

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.880
I implore you to keep running!

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:33.921
Even if you run out of breath,
or your legs are broken!

00:06:33.988 --> 00:06:35.357
For a few minutes.

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:38.062
Please try to survive!

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.200
There's still hope for us.

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:42.838
That is why you
mustn't surrender yet!

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:18.977
[grunting]

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.084
The king is right.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.587
Yeah!

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:26.492
[TOWNSMAN D]
We can't give up!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.797
[TOWNSMAN E]
Run!

00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:38.984
Move faster! Everyone,
get to downtown, now!

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:41.924
I have to live,
for myself and my baby!

00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:44.929
There's still a chance
that we'll survive!

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.469
We just gotta have some hope!

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.216
That guy up there.

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:57.888
He's gonna protect our kingdom!

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:03.734
If I take too much time,
then it's all over!

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.363
[yells]

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.269
Nice try!

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.608
Such a stubborn brat.

00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:45.818
[LUFFY panting]

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:48.355
[LUFFY]
Crap. I can't get near him

00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:50.994
with all these
strings in the way!

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.916
[panting] But I gotta hurry.

00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:07.327
Mingo!

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:18.282
[yells]

00:09:34.448 --> 00:09:36.953
Break White outta hold you!

00:09:38.323 --> 00:09:40.193
That was close!

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.733
You little gnat!

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.693
[yells]

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:05.745
Your demise is long overdue.

00:10:05.812 --> 00:10:10.988
[panting] There's not
much time left!

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:24.982
I told you, it's time to die!

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:36.306
Oh no. The whole town's
turning to string!

00:10:36.372 --> 00:10:39.010
And now, Billow-White!

00:10:40.413 --> 00:10:41.381
[gasps]

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.934
It's over!

00:10:57.247 --> 00:10:59.719
I'll blow you away!

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:08.002
[DOFLAMINGO]
Damn you!

[LUFFY grunts]

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.745
You're mine now!

00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:37.193
Don't talk such a big game
if you can't deliver, boy!

00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:48.617
I'm gonna end this for good.

00:11:48.683 --> 00:11:50.253
[gasps]

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.927
With my Gum-Gum...

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.945
...Leo Bazooka!

[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:35.864
He won. He beat Doflamingo!

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.218
[panting]

00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:09.866
I--I don't believe it!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.067
He saved Dressrosa,

00:14:11.134 --> 00:14:14.007
just like King Riku
said he would!

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:25.664
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:37.621
[gasps] Is that--?

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:45.136
He looks strange,
but it must be!

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:52.250
That amazing skill!

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:55.891
[groans]

00:14:55.958 --> 00:15:00.132
[yelling]

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:03.038
[GYATS] And a body that
stretches like rubber!

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:07.815
[gasps] It can't be,
and yet it is!

00:15:07.882 --> 00:15:09.251
[TOWNSMAN M]
He did it!

00:15:09.317 --> 00:15:11.856
[TOWNSMAN N] Thanks to him,
Dressrosa is free!

00:15:11.923 --> 00:15:13.794
Go, gumball guy!

00:15:13.861 --> 00:15:16.566
Gumball? No, he's a lot
more than that.

00:15:16.633 --> 00:15:17.701
[TOWNSMAN O]
Hm?

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:19.304
Didn't you hear
King Riku's speech?

00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:24.949
Come on! He's the pirate
they call Straw Hat Luffy!

00:15:26.953 --> 00:15:30.627
You won, Lucy! Great work!

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.979
You're our hero! We love you!

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:41.983
Wait a second.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.121
You saw Luffy's face
in the newspaper.

00:15:44.188 --> 00:15:46.559
This guy looks way different!

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:49.933
So how can we be sure it's him?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.801
[TOWNSMAN R gasps]

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:53.172

00:15:55.209 --> 00:15:57.815
Sorry, but are you
Straw Hat Luffy?

00:15:57.882 --> 00:15:59.151
Uh, yeah.

00:15:59.218 --> 00:16:00.954
I heard Straw Hat's a monster.

00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:03.794
Like 26 feet tall!
But this guy...

00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:06.265
He can't be more than
14 feet or so.

00:16:06.331 --> 00:16:08.069
Does that mean he's a fake?

00:16:08.136 --> 00:16:11.843
Hey, bouncy boy!
Are you legit or not?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.847
Just give it a rest!

00:16:13.914 --> 00:16:15.984
Why are you still
bouncing around?

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:17.855
Can't you stop that?

00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:19.490
Nuh-uh.

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:31.716
Whoa, what was that noise?

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.254
Everyone else heard that, right?

00:16:36.826 --> 00:16:38.229
[USOPP]
Viola?

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:43.707
[gasps] Straw Hat. He did it!

[BOTH]
Huh?

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:47.079
Really, you're sure?

00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.602
Amazing! What a
devastating blow!

00:16:57.668 --> 00:17:00.640
There's no way he
survived such a thing!

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:06.418
[LAW]
Hey, look at the sky!

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.788
[gasps]

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:20.513

Not enough.

[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:48.302
[BOTH] The damn Birdcage.
It's still there!

00:17:55.183 --> 00:17:56.351
[CAVENDISH]
You're right!

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:59.892
[gasps] In that case,
Doflamingo is...

00:17:59.959 --> 00:18:02.196
He isn't dead yet.

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:04.768
Please, Straw Hat.

00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:13.720
One more! Then you're done!

[LUFFY yelling]

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.732
It's time for Gum-Gum...

[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:18:52.732 --> 00:18:55.837
[TOWNSMAN Y] Hey, what's
the matter? Are you okay?

00:18:55.904 --> 00:19:02.551

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:26.331
That's Jesus Burgess!
What's he doing here?

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.535
[KOALA]
He landed that?

00:19:27.602 --> 00:19:30.306
I had no idea he could
jump that far!

00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:33.045
Hey, Sabo, are you there?

00:19:33.112 --> 00:19:34.915
Come on! Pick up!

00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:38.289
It looks like Straw Hat's
at the end of his rope!

00:19:38.355 --> 00:19:43.733
This is my chance! [laughs]

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.371
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:50.647
[gasps] I know that guy!

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.419
[TOWNSMAN Z] He's the
captain of the first ship

00:19:53.486 --> 00:19:56.559
of Emperor Blackbeard's
pirate group!

00:19:56.626 --> 00:20:00.332
They call him "Champ" Burgess!

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:04.776
You've got somethin'
and I want it,

00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:07.079
which means you're dead!

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:10.687
The Gum-Gum Fruit is mine!

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.976
--Are you all right?
--Wait, we can't get too close!

00:20:22.978 --> 00:20:24.581
He's still a pirate, remember?

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:26.351
And pirates
shouldn't be trusted!

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:28.923
Who knows what
he's gonna do next?

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.426
But how can you say that?

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:31.930
He beat Doflamingo.

00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:34.668
If not for him, the whole
kingdom would be done for!

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:38.743
Yeah, she's right!
That guy isn't going to hurt us!

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.949
I don't know.
I just can't trust him.

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:45.389
[panting]

00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:46.659
[TOWNSMAN AA]
He's a pirate.

00:20:46.726 --> 00:20:49.898
For all we know,
he's the same as Doflamingo!

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:08.301
Now don't forget!

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:10.006
King Riku said that
Straw Hat Luffy

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:11.475
would be the one to save us!

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:13.011
Come on, tell us, man!

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:14.815
So is the battle
over now, or what?

00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:17.888
[TOWNSWOMAN F] What about
Doflamingo? Is he dead?

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:59.738
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:22:06.652 --> 00:22:10.861
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:22:10.927 --> 00:22:13.533
[TOWNSMAN AE] It's no good!
He's still alive!

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.604
[TOWNSMAN AF]
We have to get away from town!

00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:19.076
[TOWNSMAN AG] Those two pirates
aren't done duking it out yet!

00:22:21.348 --> 00:22:24.253
[TOWNSMAN AH]
Even downtown isn't safe now!

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.291
[TOWNSMAN AI]
Then where the hell do we go?

00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:28.362
[TOWNSMAN AJ]
The Birdcage is closing in,

00:22:28.428 --> 00:22:30.867
there's nowhere left to run!

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.464
Dammit, Mingo.

00:22:51.007 --> 00:22:54.581
[panting]

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.590
[NARRATOR]
Doflamingo strikes back

00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:19.030
while Luffy is incapacitated
from using up all of his Haki.

00:23:19.096 --> 00:23:20.266
For ten long minutes,

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:22.737
Luffy will be unable
to defend Dressrosa.

00:23:22.804 --> 00:23:25.309
In the meantime, a desperate
battle prevents him from

00:23:25.375 --> 00:23:26.780
being killed by Doflamingo,

00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:29.417
who has now become
the embodiment of rage!

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:31.020
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:38.101
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
