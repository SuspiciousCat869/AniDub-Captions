00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,423
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,160
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,727
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,730
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,265
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,068
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,736
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,672
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,542
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,178
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,712
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:02,149
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,385
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,789
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,958
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,630
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,769
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,206
Luffy struggled in vain
to rescue his brother Ace

19
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,374
from execution at
the hands of the Navy.

20
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,478
Marineford was then thrown
into chaos by Blackbeard,

21
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,847
who stole Whitebeard's
Devil Fruit power.

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,881
Traumatized by the
death of his brother,

23
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,552
Luffy is carried away by Jimbei,
who fights to escape the island

24
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,688
alongside Whitebeard's
surviving crew.

25
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,492
How about I give Marineford
a burial at sea?

26
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,467
[BLACKBEARD groaning]

27
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,236
[BLACKBEARD]
Shock Wave!

28
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,405
You can tear down our buildings,

29
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,607
but in time,
we will rebuild them.

30
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,376
But this island is different,

31
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,444
it's more than
a symbol of our strength.

32
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,314
It stands in the
center of the world,

33
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,883
and that means if we want
to protect innocent people

34
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,085
from criminals such as yourself,

35
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,521
it must be our stronghold,

36
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,557
so its light can
reach every corner.

37
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,995
It doesn't perish,

38
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,265
and it will certainly
not sink by your hand.

39
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:27,434
Time to learn your place.

40
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,536
Well? C'mon!

41
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,574
Let's see what you're made of!

42
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,941
[MARINE Q]
Destroy them!

00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,343
[MARINE Q, MARINE R]
Destroy them!

[MARINE Q, MARINE R, MARINE S]
Destroy them!

[MARINES]
Destroy them!

46
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,917
What are these
voices in my head?

47
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,953
I dare not face him on dry land,

48
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,888
but the sea will aid me!

49
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,491
[AKAINU growls]

50
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,360
[JIMBEI grunts]

51
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,897
The water, it's frozen solid!

52
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,164
Sables!

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,669
[JIMBEI groans]

54
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,840
I say if you're gonna protect
someone, then do it right!

55
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,140
I don't like either of you,

56
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,542
but if you screw this up,

57
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,410
then you let the Navy win.

58
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,984
What is that?

59
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,687
It was underwater... A ship?

60
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,788
[PIRATE FF]
It's a submarine!

61
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,657
[PIRATE GG]
That's a Jolly Roger.

62
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,094
[LAW]
Quick! Hand over Straw Hat!

63
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,464
Huh? I don't take
orders from you, pal!

64
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,867
And besides, what do you want
with him anyway, ya weirdo?

65
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,036
Actually, who the hell are you?

66
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,438
Hand him over and we can escape.

67
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,174
He'll die without my help.

68
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,608
What?

69
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,548
Trust me. I'm a doctor.

70
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,493
Oh, "Doctor," my ass!

71
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,862
What kind of doctor
carries a giant sword?

72
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,331
And the whole submarine
thing is fishy, too.

73
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,298
What's your deal?

74
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,233
Who is it?

75
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,635
Another pirate crew?

76
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,169
It's Trafalgar Law, sir!

77
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,438
He's a rookie from
the North Blue.

78
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,540
[MARINE A] Then he must
be Straw Hat's accomplice.

79
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,744
The two started trouble with the
Celestial Dragons on Sabaody

80
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,547
a while back, but we weren't
able to capture either of them.

81
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,114
He's quite dangerous.

82
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,051
[MARINE B] They must be
planning to escape by submarine!

Stop screwin' around!

84
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,554

What's in it for you?

approaching from the stern!

Damn it! There's no time!

00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,073
We gotta escape now!

92
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,947
Even if he does survive today,

93
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,417
what makes you think Straw Hat
will do you any favors?

94
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,219
He's the son of the most
heinous criminal in the world.

95
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,922
He could be your undoing just as
easily as he could be your ally.

96
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,326
If you're so determined to
stand in the path of justice,

I will grind you
beneath it's wheels.

on Straw Hat or anyone else!

00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,112
These are human lives!

352
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,214
This is wrong!

353
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,516
They have families, children!

354
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,353
They're our friends and
we're watching them die!

355
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,423
[COBY] We killed Ace!
Whitebeard is dead!

356
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,160
The pirates don't have
the will to fight anymore!

357
00:20:59,193 --> 00:21:00,728
What are we trying to prove?

358
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,196
What's the point?

359
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,364
[COBY]
There are wounded men out there!

360
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,767
We could save them if
we stopped fighting!

361
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,069
[COBY] But no! We're
just making more victims!

362
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:13,507
More casualties! Those Marines
have nothing to be proud of.

363
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,409
That's Coby...

364
00:21:15,443 --> 00:21:16,777
Why are they dying?

365
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,180
What are they even fighting for?

366
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:23,951
Boy, you better run.

367
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,822
[COBY gasping]

368
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,723
You're wasting my time.

369
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:34,962
If you would impede justice,
I have no use for you.

370
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:35,863
[COBY]
This is it.

371
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:37,264
Not exactly what I'd hoped for,

372
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,733
but at least I said
what I had to say.

373
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,435
[AKAINU growling]

374
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:43,603
[COBY]
I have no regrets!

375
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,473
Coby!

376
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,945
[MARINES gasp]

377
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,554
[AKAINU]
Huh?

378
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:06,493
A splendid speech,
touched my heart.

379
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:09,763
And though they were few, those
precious moments of courage

380
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,566
you showed will
change this world.

381
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,901
Though only the future will tell

382
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:16,603
if it's for the better
or for the worse.

383
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:18,505
Inside! I'll be
right behind you!

384
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:19,340
[BEPO]
Roger!

385
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,608
I don't think so.

386
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:27,615
Put your hands up, now.

387
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:31,084
Oooh, I'll be! Ben Beckman!

388
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,454
[MARINE KK]
Hey, wait a second.

389
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,122
I know that ship!

390
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,524
[LAW]
Let's move!

391
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:38,359
What's he doing here?

392
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:41,228
One of the Four
Emperors and his crew!

393
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:44,431
[MARINES] It's "Red-Haired"
Shanks. Oh, no!

394
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,913
[SHANKS] It's been
a long time, old friend.

395
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:05,018
Let's end this war.

396
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,496
[NARRATOR] Suddenly, the
Red Hair Pirates appear!

397
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,432
As the Navy stares on in shock,
Law tries to escape

398
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,769
while suffering heavy
fire from the admirals.

399
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,838
Narrowly missing
a reunion with Luffy,

400
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:26,072
Shanks utters a speech
on the battlefield

401
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,275
that brings the
fighting to a halt.

402
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,977
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

403
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,081
"Here Comes Shanks! The War
of the Best is Finally Over!"

404
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,349
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
