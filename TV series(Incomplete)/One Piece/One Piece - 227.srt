1
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,319
Hey Chopper, did you
find any new herbs to use?

2
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,387
[CHOPPER] Mhmm! This place
has all sorts of neat stuff.

3
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,354
I got a good stock,

4
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,058
but I'm still in case
I missed something.

5
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,161
Which reminds me, I noticed
something weird a second ago.

6
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,396
There's a little groove
along the trail here.

7
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,764
I wonder what it is.

8
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,700
[USOPP] Oh, you're
right. That is weird.

9
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:18,606
Looks like a bicycle or
something came through here.

10
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,607
[LUFFY]
Well that's a letdown.

11
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,644
Just looks like a whole
lotta nothing out here.

12
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:28,782
[snores]

13
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:32,786
[AOKIJI] Hmm?
A raccoon dog?

14
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,555
See the antlers?!
I'm a reindeer!

15
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,258
[LUFFY]
I saw you fall! Are you hurt?

16
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,259
Who the heck is that?!

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,828
[ZORO]
What's going on?

18
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,730
[AOKIJI]
Do you mind? I was sleeping.

19
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,598
Did you hit my friend?!

20
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,700
Oh, man. That guy is huge!

21
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,502
I thought we were
alone on this island!

22
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,604
[gasps]

23
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,305
[CREW] Huh?

24
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,376
You know him?

25
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:29,109
This guy has Robin scared
out of her freakin' mind. Why?

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,819
He's a marine.

27
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,222
Navy Headquarters
Admiral Aokiji.

28
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,724
[CREW]
Admiral?!

29
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,193
Wait, you mean this
guy's an Admiral?!

30
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,395
That's one of the
highest ranks there is!

31
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,830
That's right.

32
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,100
There are only three
officers in the entire Navy

33
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:57,037
who currently hold
the position of Admiral.

34
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,343
Akainu, Aokiji, and Kizaru.

35
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:05,279
The only one who outranks
them is Fleet Admiral Sengoku,

36
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,680
the Navy's top official.

37
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,249
The man you see
standing before you

38
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,750
is one of the
three men known as

39
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,320
the World Government's
Ultimate Powerhouses.

40
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,123
But why the heck's
someone like this even here?

41
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,058
Shouldn't you be out
hunting some big-time pirates

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,396
with bazillion berry bounties
or somethin'?! G-Go away!

43
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,530
Huh?

44
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,634
Oh, my, my...

45
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,635
What? What is it?

46
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:31,205
Another very sexy lady
with super big bazongas.

47
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,539
Are you free tonight?

48
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,742
You watch your mouth,
you lanky jerk!

49
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,510
Hey! Focus! Pay attention!

50
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,546
Whoa, whoa, hold
on a second you guys!

51
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,315
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

52
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,318
I'm just out
taking a little stroll.

53
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,220
Don't get so worked up, okay?

54
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,689
I mean you guys are just,

55
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,226
you're like just
what-cha-ma-call-its, you know?

56
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,627
What?

57
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,528
What'd he say?

58
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,097
Hmmm...

59
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,432
[AOKIJI]
I forgot. Oh, well.

60
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,035
You're not making
any sense, you weirdo!

61
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,269
Robin, are you kidding?

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,104
You must be mistaking
him for someone else.

63
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,106
This doofus wouldn't
pass as a regular marine,

64
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,474
let alone an admiral!

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,310
Hey come on, you
shouldn't go around

66
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,245
judging people based
on their appearance.

67
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,682
The motto I've
always lived by

68
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:18,152
as a Marine is
Total Slovenly Justice.

69
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,687
Then our judgment was right!

70
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,122
Anyway, what I was saying.

71
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,359
Uh, excuse me a moment.

72
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,561
[AOKIJI] Being on my feet
too long makes me tired.

73
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,096
Yeah? Then maybe
you shouldn'ta been

74
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,398
sleeping standing up, ya' think?

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,399
What I was saying,

76
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,602
is that I have no
intention of capturing you

77
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,671
or anything like that,
so just take it easy.

78
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,674
I'm only here to confirm the
whereabouts of Nico Robin,

79
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,611
who hadn't been seen
since the Alabasta incident.

80
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,313
As we suspected,
she's been with you.

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,482
[SANJI] That is one
tall piece of apathy.

82
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,318
The only thing high-ranking
about him is his nerve.

83
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,722
I'll put some sort of report
together for headquarters later.

84
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,757
Now that you've added
another crewmember

85
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,559
who's got a price on her head,

86
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,661
your overall bounty has gone up.

87
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:06,766
100 million, plus 60 million,
plus 79 million equals...

88
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,572
[AOKIJI] Aww, screw it.
Some big-ass number.

89
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,440
Just do the damn math.

90
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,076
[LUFFY]
That's it! Gum-Gum...

91
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,378
[SANJI]
Hold on, Luffy!

92
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,746
[USOPP]
Stop it! Stop!

93
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:22,416
What are you guys
doing?! Let me go!

94
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,418
Why are you trying to
start a fight with this guy?

95
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,385
Are you crazy?!

96
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,121
He's one of the
strongest marines there is!

97
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,389
I'm not just
gonna stand around

98
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,824
while this jerk tries to
take Robin away from us!

99
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:31,825
[AOKIJI]
Take it easy!

100
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,296
I told you I'm not gonna
do anything, remember?

101
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,398
[LUFFY] Well, I am!
I'm kicking your ass!

102
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,098
[SANJI]
Stop it, dammit!

103
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,600
[USOPP]
Hold on! Just relax!

104
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,636
Huh?

105
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,703
Eh?

106
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,607
So you're really a marine?

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,676
I wish we'd known
that a lot sooner.

108
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,712
Hey, who are
all these people?

109
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,380
[SANJI]
Whoa! Are you guys okay?

110
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,282
[USOPP] I thought this
island was uninhabited.

111
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,552
Well, they're
probably castaways

112
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,321
that washed up
on the shore here.

113
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,623
There was a passenger liner
that was reported missing

114
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,260
about a month ago, last
seen somewhere in this area.

115
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,696
I'm guessing it sank,
and these are the survivors.

116
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,703
How are they, Chopper?

117
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:16,704
Some of them are injured,

118
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,206
but it doesn't appear to
be anything too serious.

119
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,508
I've got some medicine
that should fix them right up.

120
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,676
But the more
pressing matter is that

121
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,712
they haven't had
much to eat in days.

122
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,946
Their bodies are weak.

123
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,449
Sanji and Usopp went to see
if they could find some food.

124
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,750
They should be back soon.

125
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,652
[USOPP]
Hey! Sorry it took so long!

126
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,727
I can only imagine
how hungry you are!

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,062
Take it easy!
No need to wolf it down.

128
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,697
There's plenty more
where that came from.

129
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,733
Yeah! No wolf!
There's plenty!

130
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,135
Hey! Why are you
eating it? Cut it out!

131
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,437
Look, this island
may be deserted,

132
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,740
but you still could have found
food on your own, you know.

133
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,808
You're lucky we came
along when we did.

134
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,777
Their ship wrecked
in the Grand Line.

135
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,445
They're lucky
to be alive at all.

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,679
Not everyone was so fortunate.

137
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:03,284
We were the only ones on the
ship who made it to this island.

138
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,018
So what happened?

139
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,123
We were on our way home
from a gourmet tour of Pucci,

140
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,759
the city renowned
for its exquisite food.

141
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,129
When suddenly, our ship
collided with a giant frog

142
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:19,366
that was doing the front crawl,
and shattered it to pieces.

143
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,236
A giant frog doing the
front crawl? Seriously?!

144
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,572
Besides, frogs normally
do the breaststroke.

145
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,041
Awesome! I have
got to see this frog!

146
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,242
That sounds crazy.

147
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,276
It's the truth!

148
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,079
Yeah, that was Yokozuna.

149
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,247
Yokozuna?

150
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,115
After what seemed
like days of struggling,

151
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,785
we were finally able to
make it to this island.

152
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,521
It didn't take long to
deplete our food supply.

153
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,090
After one month, we were
on the brink of starvation.

154
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,259
Then, we spotted someone
approaching the island.

155
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,627
We rejoiced until we noticed

156
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,796
he was riding a
bicycle on the water.

157
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,699
Come on. That's even more
far-fetched than the frog!

158
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,802
Ah that was me, actually.

159
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,339
The only boat we spotted
after that was a pirate ship.

160
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,573
[NAMI]
That was us.

161
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:05,779
Well... That makes you one of
those, uh-uh those you know.

162
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,515
[SANJI and USOPP]
Spit it out, dammit!

163
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,150
Aw, man! I forgot!

164
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,752
Stop screwing us around, jerk!

165
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,520
Calm down, Luffy!
Get a hold of yourself!

166
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,220
Take it easy!

167
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,456
[AOKIJI]
Didn't you hear me?

168
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,129
I told you, I'm
just out on a stroll.

169
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,397
[LUFFY]
A stroll, huh?

170
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,698
Then go take your
stroll somewhere else!

171
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,365
Get out of here!

172
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,134
Why are you so angry at me?

173
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,304
[NAMI thinking] It's like
he's trying to pick a fight!

174
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:34,642
Okay. Whatever,
I'll leave, but before I do.

175
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,343
You guys should
gather your stuff

176
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,545
and get ready
to leave, too.

177
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,748
Fortunately, I know
of an inhabited island

178
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,384
that's not too far
away from this one.

179
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:47,288
You should go there and
ask them to help you out.

180
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:48,255
Hey! You guys!

181
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,758
Don't believe a word
he says, understand me?!

182
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,326
This jerk's a marine officer!

183
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,166
So what? Is that a problem?

184
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,072
[LUFFY]
Oh! That's right! I get it!

185
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,307
I guess that makes sense.

186
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,708
Normally, the marines
are your friends

187
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,644
and the pirates are
the bad guys, right?

188
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,479
Stop it! What's so funny?

189
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,682
Him! How is he
gonna help anybody?

190
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,050
I don't know!

191
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,751
Heck, I don't even
think he has a ship!

192
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,121
Other than ours, there isn't
another ship around anywhere!

193
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:21,689
Let's see...

194
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,690
There's no ship,

195
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,658
and nobody here seems to
have a Log Pose, either.

196
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,726
How in the world
are they supposed

197
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,461
to get to that island, anyway?

198
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,263
Oh, they'll be fine.

199
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,399
Nothing you say sounds
the least bit convincing.

200
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,267
It's true.

201
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,305
[ROBIN] He does have
the power to help them.

202
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,085
That should do it!

203
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,720
We loaded them up
with food and water.

204
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,222
It should be enough to
last them for quite a while.

205
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,658
Feels good to do a little
work from time to time.

206
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,193
Yeah, no doubt about that!

207
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,729
Hey, you know something?
You're not so bad!

208
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,198
What do you know?
They're hitting it off.

209
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,032
Okay, so now what?

210
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,133
Are you gonna
swim to that island

211
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,669
and drag these guys and
all their stuff behind you?

212
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,137
Don't be ridiculous.

213
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,442
All right, everybody stay back!

214
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,566
What is that thing?

215
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,101
It's some kind of monster!

216
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,170
I bet it's the guardian
of this part of the sea!

217
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,413
Hey, you! Run for it! Look out!

218
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,549
Get outta there! Gum-Gum...

219
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,653
Ice Age.

220
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,001
A devil fruit!

221
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,515
[LUFFY]
The sea! It's frozen!

222
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,352
This is the power of a
Navy Headquarters Admiral.

223
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,357
It'll stay like that
for at least a week.

224
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,530
Head out across the
sea in that direction.

225
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,098
And take your time.

226
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,601
You should reach the
island in about four days.

227
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,206
It's going to be a
little on the chilly side,

228
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,610
so be sure to bundle
up and stay warm.

229
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,446
Is this a dream?

230
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:37,418
[GENTLEMAN A] The sea has
become as hard as the ground!

231
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,253
We can finally cross it!

232
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,789
Now we'll be able to
get off of this island!

233
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,424
Thank you! Thanks so much!

234
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,563
[GENTLEMAN A] It's a miracle!
The marine granted us a miracle!

235
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:04,178
[GENTLEMAN A] All right then.
Time for us to get going.

236
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,547
[LUFFY] Right. I'm really
happy for you guys.

237
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,715
[NAMI]
Take care!

238
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,351
I guess there are all sorts
of different pirates, huh?

239
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:11,518
How can we ever thank you

240
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,420
for everything that
you've done for us?

241
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,688
Not only did you treat our sick

242
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:18,325
and injured but you shared your
food and water with us, as well!

243
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,260
Aw, don't worry about it!

244
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:22,296
Good things happen
to good people.

245
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,831
Just let fate take its course.

246
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,833
Make sure the
children don't catch cold.

247
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,368
Keep them bundled up tight.

248
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,236
At any rate, these
colder temperatures

249
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,205
should keep your
food fresh longer.

250
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,140
Thank you all very much.

251
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,609
We will never
forget your kindness!

252
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,544
Take care,
Straw Hat Pirates!

253
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,480
[NAMI]
Bye! Take care!

254
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,051
Be careful on your trip!
Safe journeys! Good-Bye!

255
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,154
That felt really good.

256
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,259
It feels like
winter just happened!

257
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,627
Check it out! I can skate!

258
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,663
Whoa! Awesome, Chopper!

259
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,764
Must be that
Winter Island blood.

260
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,270
[CHOPPER]
How about this one?

261
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,606
[CHOPPER]
You guys should try it, too!

262
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,442
Man, it's cold!

263
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,344
I'm freezing!

264
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,545
Huh?

265
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:16,216
Hmm...

266
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,384
What is it?

267
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,786
[LUFFY]
How should I put this?

268
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,120
You're the spitting image

269
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,691
of your grandfather,
Monkey D. Luffy.

270
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:26,794
Or, maybe should I say
you're just as reckless

271
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:29,263
and hard to figure out.

272
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,799
You knew my grampa?!

273
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:34,467
Seriously? Luffy's?

274
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,341
Hey, Luffy! What's wrong?
You're sweating.

275
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:43,410
Uh, nothing! Really! I'm fine!

276
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,646
Your grandfather
helped me out once.

277
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,083
A long time ago.
That's why I'm here.

278
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,017
I wanted to see you

279
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,189
and Nico Robin together
with my own eyes.

280
00:15:55,222 --> 00:16:00,561
On second thought, maybe
I should just kill you.

281
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,697
The government still doesn't
consider you a threat.

282
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,266
But I know enough
of your history

283
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,335
to see you're
a formidable crew.

284
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,037
You may be few in number,

285
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,107
but with the shrewd
rogues gathered here,

286
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,543
this crew will likely
be a problem later on.

287
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,147
Considering the circumstances
regarding your initial bounty,

288
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,483
the numerous daring
actions you've taken,

289
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:25,386
and the speed of
your overall progress.

290
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,521
I've fought outlaws
for most of my life,

291
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,256
but thinking about
how you'll turn out

292
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,492
scares the hell out of me.

293
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,127
Hey! Wait! Hold on a second!

294
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,495
You said you were just here

295
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,330
to check things out,
not to kill anyone!

296
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,533
[AOKIJI] One among you
I consider the most dangerous.

297
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:42,570
That would be you,
Nico Robin.

298
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,072
So despite everything,
you are here for Robin!

299
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,640
Now I'm really
gonna kick your ass!

300
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,809
The size of her bounty
isn't merely a reflection

301
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,511
of her strength and power,

302
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,413
it also represents
something else.

303
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,480
That would be
the level of threat

304
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,117
and danger that she poses
to the World Government.

305
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,820
That's why a
79-million-berry-bounty

306
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:04,325
was placed on her head at
the tender young age of 8.

307
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:07,494
I'm impressed you were able to
survive, especially as a child.

308
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,130
You managed to betray,
sidestep, and escape

309
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,632
from everyone in your past.

310
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:14,201
And then found a new
partner to make use of.

311
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:18,172
You survived in the underworld
by being quick to switch sides.

312
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,342
And now you've chosen this
crew as your next haven.

313
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,409
That's enough, jerk!

314
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,577
I'm not just gonna stand here

315
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,346
and let you speak
to a lady like that!

316
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,115
What kind of ridiculous grudge
are you holding against Robin?!

317
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,483
Stop it, Sanji!

318
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,819
I don't have
anything against her.

319
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,488
The only connection
we have between us

320
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,757
is that I let her escape
from me one time,

321
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,361
but that's about it.
It was a long time ago.

322
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:42,229
You will all learn soon enough

323
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,198
that protecting this
troublesome woman

324
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,133
leads to nothing but regret.

325
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,235
If you need proof,
consider this.

326
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:51,605
Every organization that
she's had something to do with

327
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,341
in the past has
been annihilated.

328
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:59,446
Not one single, solitary
member escaped, except for her.

329
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:03,317
Why is that, Nico Robin?

330
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,619
Shut up, you jerk!
The past doesn't matter!

331
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,720
That's right!

332
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,888
If it did, then
we wouldn't have

333
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,090
a dangerous former pirate
hunter guy or a degenerate,

334
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,726
conniving, ex-thief woman
on our crew, would we?!

335
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,960
Don't go overboard!

336
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,597
[SANJI] Who we are now is more
important than who we were!

337
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,365
[CHOPPER] That's right!
Robin is our friend!

338
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,002
Don't you dare say anything
bad about her, you hear me?!

339
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,508
I see. So these poor fools
don't suspect a thing.

340
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,642
Just get to the point!

341
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:29,443
If you want to arrest me,

342
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,712
then why not just
do it already?!

343
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,048
Trienta Fleurs!

344
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,783
No! Robin!

345
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,084
My, my, my!

346
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,286
Did something
I say strike a nerve?

347
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,520
That's too bad.

348
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:43,490
I must have overestimated how
reasonable a woman you were.

349
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,225
And clutch!

350
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,361
AAAH! He shattered
into a million pieces!

351
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,704
It didn't work! We're screwed!

352
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,074
Let's get out of here!

353
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,343
Everybody run for your lives!

354
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,350
AAAAAHHHH!

355
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:13,620
Now, now. That wasn't
a very nice thing to do.

356
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,771
Ice Saber!

357
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,673
I didn't wanna have
to kill you, but now.

358
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,544
[clank]

359
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:51,091
Slice Shoot!

360
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,460
Yeah!

361
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,297
I don't remember asking
for your help, cook.

362
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,799
Funny, I was gonna say the
same thing to you, moss head.

363
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:02,135
Gum-Gum...

364
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:07,107
...Pistol!

365
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,644
He's cold!

366
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,787
Ah-h! He froze 'em!
He froze 'em! Ah-h!!

367
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,489
He got all three
of them! At once!

368
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,339
He's freezing them solid!

369
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,074
I have to help quickly!

370
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:44,044
If they get frostbite,
their limbs will start to rot!

371
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,045
Usopp, what are you doing?!

372
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,714
We have to save them! Now!

373
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,749
I want to help! I'm trying to!

374
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,785
But I can't seem to move!
Did he freeze me, too?

375
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,555
No! You're just too
scared to move, coward!

376
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,090
Aaaaah!! Luffy!

377
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,325
Sanji! Zoro!
Hold on! We'll save you!

378
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:00,460
Robin! Run away!

379
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,064
You have some
very loyal friends.

380
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,401
But you will never
change, Nico Robin!

381
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,270
No! That's not true!

382
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,412
Robin! Get away
from him! Watch out!

383
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,313
I'm not who I--

384
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,316
Robin!

385
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,557
Aaaah!!

[CHOPPER]
She's frozen!

[AOKIJI]
Don't despair!

390
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,633
Her death will be
a benefit the world!

What'd you say?!

Luffy?

395
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:26,273
[LUFFY] Step back. I'm gonna
handle this guy on my own.

396
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:29,343
[AOKIJI] Fine by me, but
what about the-the, uhm...

What-cha-ma-call-it?

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,545
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

"Duel Between Rubber
and Ice! Luffy vs Aokiji!"

400
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,351
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
