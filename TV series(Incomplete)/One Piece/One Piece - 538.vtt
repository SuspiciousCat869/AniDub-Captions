WEBVTT

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.200
[NARRATOR] Two years have passed
since the War of the Best

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.267
in Marineford.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.336
Reuniting after their
special training,

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.372
Luffy and his crew continue
on to the New World.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:28.341
Their first stop
is Fishman Island,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.376
thousands of feet
below sea level,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.112
where trouble seems to
find them wherever they go.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.615
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.618
plot to overthrow King Neptune
and rule the kingdom.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.620
They have teamed up
with Vander Decken,

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.656
who has eyes on
the mermaid princess.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.594
The Straw Hat Pirates are now
entrenched in the conflict.

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:50.530
As Luffy escorted the
princess to the Sea Forest,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.665
Vander Decken
blocked their path.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.401
[DECKEN]
I found you, Princess!

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:59.038
I suspect!
Ba ho ho ho ho!

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.373
C'mere, sweetie!

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.644
Oh, no. Please, not now.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:07.914
[DECKEN] Ugh! Quit sticking
your butt into my business!

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.116
This is between us!

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.751
[grunts]

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.657
All right.
Now Gum-Gum... Jet...

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.292
...Hammer!

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.496
[LUFFY]
Okay, Shark! Get movin'!

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:27.734
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, at the
palace, Zoro and the others

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.937
wage battle with Hordy after
his New Fishman Pirates

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.939
launched a plan to sneak inside.

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:36.409
[HORDY]
Your era's at an end!

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.578
You miserable,
worthless primate!

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.858
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style... Lion Strike!

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.300
[LUFFY]
"The Straw Hats Defeated?!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.902
Hordy Gains Control
of the Ryugu Palace!"

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.179
[PIRATES gasping]

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.216
[USOPP]
Zoro!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.921
[PIRATE A]
Boss!

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:23.122
[PIRATE B]
Boss!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.794
How did a human
cut down one of us

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.795
in the water?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.030
And not just any Fishman,
but Hordy?

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.999
Where does that power come from?

00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:37.603
[ZORO]
I gotta get some air!

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.573
Kill him!

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.108
We can't let him get away!

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.844
Don't be afraid,
he's strong, but he's human!

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:47.080
He's gotta be close to drowning!

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:48.815
Move in and surround him!

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.452
Take an energy steroid,
just to be sure!

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:07.133
[PIRATES chuckling]

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.170
You're screwed now!

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.706
Kill 'em all!
Neptune's army, too!

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.274
[PIRATES yell]

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.078
[ZORO]
Not good.

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:22.315
[PIRATE F cackling]

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:25.651
[NEPTUNE]
What's happening?

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.554
It's as if a wave of madness
has washed over them.

00:06:29.422 --> 00:06:30.490
Zoro!

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:37.597
[PIRATES chuckling]

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.899
Is he okay?
He's still down there!

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:41.067
Why won't he come up?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.535
I feel sick.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.905
If I can't get out of this
water, my lunch is coming up.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:47.140
[USOPP]
What should we do?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.275
[PIRATE C yells]

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:52.912
Die! Tear him to shreds!

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.080
[PIRATES laughing]

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:05.625
All you can do now
is try to hold us off!

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:07.427
Might as well quit!

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.363
You're running out
of air, aren't you?

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.703
[laughs]

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.605
Can't find a way out, huh?

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.340
'Cause there isn't one.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.975
Now die!

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:25.411
[ZORO] No way I'm losing
to some thug like you.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.879
One-Sword Style...

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.015
...Thirty Six Caliber Phoenix!

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.450
[PIRATES yelling]

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.458
Damn it, ignore him for now!

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.359
Kill everyone else!

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.427
[USOPP]
Zoro!

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:45.264
[NEPTUNE] Soon, the room
will be completely submerged.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.767
Come here and hold on,
so that we may flee together.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.104
[PIRATES laugh]

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:56.342
[NEPTUNE] There is something
unnatural about their strength.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.711
My army is highly skilled
and they've made quick work

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:00.112
of them.

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:03.716
I have to save my men and
I have to save my kingdom.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:07.620
Here, you should be able
to secure some air with this.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.021
Oh, good, thanks!

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:10.323
[NEPTUNE]
Hang onto me tightly.

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:11.491
This may get rough.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:12.592
You got it!

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.797
[NEPTUNE]
There's no more time to spare!

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.867
[USOPP] Zoro, swim faster,
we gotta get outta here!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.768
[NEPTUNE] I only hope that
my back doesn't give out

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.303
when I need it most.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:35.648
[PIRATES chuckling]

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:41.053
[NEPTUNE]
Ready yourselves, my soldiers.

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.222
I shall create a path for you!

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:45.658
We shall retreat
to fight another day!

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.396
Merman... Combat!

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.234
Take this! You're gonna need it!

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.103
[NEPTUNE]
Here we go!

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.138
[yelling]

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.976
Neptune's up to something.
Get ready!

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.044
Zoro!

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:09.649
[NEPTUNE]
Ultramarine!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.222
[PIRATES yelling]

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:22.662
[NEPTUNE grunts]

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.931
All soldiers, forward!

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.098
[FISHMEN]
Sir!

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.467
[NEPTUNE] Ride the current
and retreat from the palace!

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.535
[PIRATE C]
Damn it!

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.203
I didn't think they'd pull back!

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.471
Now what?

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:33.940
Here, take one of these, boss!

00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.341
That'll fix you right up!

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.079
[FISHMAN A]
Don't look back!

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.714
We're almost there!

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.550
[FISHMAN B] Pass through the
gate and head inland!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.419
[USOPP]
We gotta move, Old Man!

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.620
Pull it together!

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.325
[NEPTUNE] Truly, there is
nothing so terrible as old age.

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.928
My will is strong, but my
body will not budge an inch.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.196
Not now!

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.568
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
The king is injured!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:04.170
[FISHMAN C]
Your highness!

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.739
[USOPP]
Aw crap, what should we do?

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:09.942
[NEPTUNE] Nothing.
This is the end, I'm afraid.

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.577
What? No!

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.646
[PIRATES chuckling]

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.648
[HOE]
Whale!

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.018
[NEPTUNE gasps]
Hoe!

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:21.787
[HOE vocalizes]

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:22.989
[NEPTUNE]
We're saved!

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:25.758
[HOE vocalizes]

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:27.693
[NEPTUNE]
I owe you my life, Hoe!

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:31.130
Ow, darn it all,
I can't even turn my head!

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.398
[USOPP]
You're not that old!

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.666
Well done, Hoe!

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.901
Now come join us, and hurry!

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:37.370
[USOPP]
Faster!

00:10:37.403 --> 00:10:38.938
[ZORO]
I'm gonna pass out!

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.107
[HOE grunting]

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.418
[HOE grunting]

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.086
What's wrong now?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.721
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.957
[USOPP] Did we get snagged
on something back there?

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:03.896
[HORDY chuckling]

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.097
[USOPP yelps]

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:10.469
[HOE vocalizes]

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:13.039
Oh, no, your highness!

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.343
Hordy grabbed him!

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.711
He can't pull away!

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.579
The pirates aren't
fleeing either!

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.682
I thought that swordsman
took care of him already!

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:25.084
Why the hell is he giving
us so much trouble?

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:25.951
Minister!

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:26.952
Let's go back!

00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:28.821
At this rate,
the king could be killed!

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:32.625
[NEPTUNE]
I told you to retreat, didn't I?

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:33.793
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:36.262
[NEPTUNE]
All is not lost if you escape!

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:39.165
Bring my sons and
we may see victory yet!

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.466
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.072
There's no time!

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.673
Do as our lord commands!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.075
[FISHMEN]
Yes, sir!

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:50.810
[PIRATE D]
Boss, they're getting away!

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.278
Should we go after them?

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.379
[HORDY]
Let 'em run.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:54.680
What do we care?

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.016
Soldiers who can't
protect their king

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.251
are no threat to us.

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.520
Speaking of the king,
tie him up in case he gets

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.055
his strength back.

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.490
[PIRATES]
Yes, sir!

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:06.859
[NEPTUNE]
I have failed you this time.

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:10.663
But so long as my allies live,
the battle is not over!

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:15.201
[chuckling]

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.040
[PIRATE O]
Whoa, what's that?

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:24.143
[PIRATE N] Dunno. Maybe the
water washed in an old corpse?

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:29.849
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Prince Fukaboshi.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.417
[FUKABOSHI] Have you any
news regarding the missing

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.952
Straw Hat Pirates?

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.153
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
No sir.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.721
Nothing of use, at least.

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.957
The patrons of this clothing
store saw Straw Hat

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.625
and three others shopping,

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.561
but they were apparently all
taken away by King Neptune.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.430
Well, that would
account for the members

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.799
who seized the palace,
but none other.

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:47.967
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Yes sir.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.902
Then where could they be?

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.637
What do we know about
the two crew members

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.707
who were seen in
Coral Hill earlier today?

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.277
We asked around,
but no luck so fa-so-la!

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.378
[FUKABOSHI]
Alas.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.515
This may prove more
complicated than I had hoped.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:05.618
Shake it, shake shake
it, it'll be fine, bro!

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.153
Maybe we should
call the palace again

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:09.555
and see if there's something
they're not telling us.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:12.024
--[TRANSPONDER SNAIL rings]
--Hey, maybe that's them now!

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.993
[AMMO KNIGHT B]
Prince Fukaboshi! Sir!

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:16.095
--Come in!
--Uh-oh.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.830
Yes, this is Fukaboshi.

00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:19.398
[AMMO KNIGHT B] There's an
urgent situation over here

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.432
in Waterwheel Town.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.334
We're requesting assistance.

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.170
Please explain.

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.805
[AMMO KNIGHT B] Men from the
Fishman District suddenly

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:26.906
invaded the town.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.908
They have some grudge
against the queen.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:29.975
[yelps]

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:34.613
Sorry, but this
is invite only, pal.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.420
Wait, what do you
mean they have a grudge

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:42.488
against my mother?

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:43.889
Tell me! Are you there?

00:13:45.591 --> 00:13:47.459
To Waterwheel Town, quickly!

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:48.494
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Yes, sir!

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.333
[IKAROS]
Are they gone?

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:57.670
[PIRATE E] Yeah, to deal
with the others, I'd guess.

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:59.071
[IKAROS]
This is a mess.

00:13:59.104 --> 00:14:01.273
Dosun couldn't wait
for the rest of us?

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.209
I know he's eager to fight,
but the whole point

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:05.611
was to attack
everyplace at once.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:06.812
Whatever.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.715
No point in complaining now.

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:11.217
Listen up, men!

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.253
This is the day that our
dreams finally come true!

00:14:14.286 --> 00:14:17.323
Draw your swords and fight
for a better tomorrow!

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:20.626
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.047
[LUFFY]
Ooh!

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:45.885
So this is the Sea Forest, huh?

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:48.254
I see why you
wanted to come here!

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.288
Thank you.

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:54.660
I've wanted to see
this place for so long.

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:59.064
You have no idea
how much this means.

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.599
[MEGALO grunts]

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.571
[CHOPPER] Hopefully we can get
some peace and quiet here.

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:08.774
Mermaids! Whoo!

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.376
Mermaids! Whoo!

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:11.577
Oh, man.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.680
[LUFFY]
Look, it's the Sunny!

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.748
Hey, you're right!

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:17.316
And I see Franky, too!

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.318
[LUFFY]
Hey, what's up!

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:21.353
I didn't know you were here!

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:23.255
Cool place, huh?

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:25.190
[FRANKY]
Wow! Look who it is!

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.195
[FRANKY] Whoa.
Is that your new girlfriend?

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:32.932
You always did like to aim big.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.266
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.505
Let me introduce you.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.173
This here is "Crybaby."

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.175
Doesn't look like
a crybaby to me.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:45.444
Tell me, sister, do you
live up to your name?

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:47.413
Maybe a little bit.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:50.316
You may call me Shirahoshi
if you please.

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.851
[LUFFY] So, uh, you're
the only one here?

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.086
[FRANKY]
'Fraid so.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.489
Robin stopped by earlier,
but she had some Robin business

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:58.724
to attend to.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:01.360
She went to that big
forest of coral over there.

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.128
Who knows when she'll be back.

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:04.229
[LUFFY]
Hmm.

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:06.799
[footsteps]

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.400
[JIMBEI]
Luffy!

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.268
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.369
[JIMBEI chuckles]

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.437
It's Jimbei!

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.074
Awesome! You're here too!

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.142
I'm so pleased that you made it.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.190
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:16:31.223 --> 00:16:33.292
You've grown even
stronger than before.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.293
I can tell.

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:35.861
People said you
couldn't come to town,

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:38.130
so I was afraid I wouldn't
get to see you.

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.798
[JIMBEI] I thought you came
here because you received

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.133
my message.

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:44.536
Hm? What message?
I didn't hear anything.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.805
[JIMBEI]
Hm. Most peculiar.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.640
A pleasure to see you, Jimbei.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.209
It's been ever so long!

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.243
Yes.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:53.545
What an unexpected meeting,
but a welcome one.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:57.483
To what do I owe the-- Wha--?!

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:59.318
What are you doing here?!

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.253
Shouldn't you be in the palace?

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.855
Do you have a sec, Franky?

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.891
I need some help getting Sanji
and Hachi off this shark.

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:07.726
[FRANKY]
You got it!

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.295
Oh! It's the octopus guy!

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.397
[HACHI]
Nyuu...

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.198
[FRANKY] Looks like you
took a beating, brother!

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:16.201
Hachi? What?!

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:17.703
You're injured!

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:18.871
What happened?

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:19.938
Scratch that.

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.107
What are you doing
on Fishman Island?

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:23.776
[JIMBEI] I heard that
Arlong was captured,

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.811
so I assumed you were as well.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:28.280
Nyuu. Long story.

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:29.648
Maybe later.

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.749
[CHOPPER]
Franky!

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.818
Let's get Sanji too!

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:34.853
[SANJI] That's all right.
I'm feeling better.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.199
[SANJI]
The Mermaid Princess at last!

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.702
Standing here. I see.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.372
How inadequate
my imagination was!

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.176
Even with all
the colors in my heart,

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.878
I could never paint a picture
as lovely as you!

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.815
--Uh-huh?
--No blood loss!

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:05.717
He's being annoying,
but also sort of cool!

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.519
The old Sanji is back!

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:08.687
Alas!

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.824
Such beauty as yours is too
vast to fit on any canvas!

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:16.662
Every shade in the world
is reduced to gray before you!

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:17.930
Is something wrong?

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.398
You're so noisy!

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.466
Huh?

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:23.202
What is Princess
Shirahoshi doing here?

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.970
Hey, who the hell is that guy?

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.306
That's my ship, buddy, get off!

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.708
Don't flip out, Captain,
this guy's a shipwright.

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.143
Tom's brother, actually.

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.946
His name's Den.
He's doing the recoating.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:36.215
Oh, then why didn't
you just say so?

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:38.784
He lives in a den and he's
recoating your brother for you,

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:39.818
huh?

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:46.024
Sure. Close enough, I guess.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:47.526
[DEN chuckles]

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:50.195
[JIMBEI]
I mean no disrespect, Princess.

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.331
I know why you would
come here, but...

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:00.906
Again?

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.778
Didn't I kick
his ass hard enough?

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.547
How many of these
is he gonna throw?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.882
Get over it, man!

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:10.916
What a mess!

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.151
What were you thinking, Luffy?

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.986
The princess
could have been killed!

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.954
C'mon, have a little faith!

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.656
She's got me to save her!

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:18.690
Yep!

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.693
She's not scared.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.869
[LUFFY] So that's the grave
she wanted to see so bad?

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.343
She's been at this
an awful long time.

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:42.681
[JIMBEI]
That is her mother's grave.

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:45.617
A monument to Queen Otohime.

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.953
Vander Decken's
relentless pursuit began

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.222
right after the death
of the queen.

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:53.725
Shirahoshi was denied
any chance at closure.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.461
And even worse,
she was unable to attend

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.297
her mother's funeral.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.399
She's spent every
day since locked

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.034
in the Hard Shell Tower.

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.344
I'm sure that over
the years all the things

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:15.414
she wanted to tell her mother
kept piling up in her heart.

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:24.456
[NAMI]
Luffy!

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.691
[CAMIE]
Luffychin!

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.194
[LUFFY]
Nami! Camie!

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.164
Oh, hey!
See there? That's the boss!

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:34.099
That's Jimbei down
there with Luffy!

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:44.109
[CAMIE] Oh. Princess
Shirahoshi is here too.

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:46.878
What?!

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.180
[LUFFY]
Hey!

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:50.249
You ever have that
banquet or what?

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:52.718
[SANJI]
Nami-swan!

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.986
[CHOPPER]
He's okay now.

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:57.589
Hatchin!

00:20:57.623 --> 00:20:59.691
What in the world happened?

00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:01.293
Camie.

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:03.028
[JIMBEI]
Hordy did this?

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:05.864
So that's what's it's come to.

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.599
To think that they
were even able to

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.734
infiltrate the palace.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:11.003
This is a dire situation indeed.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.204
What about everyone else?

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.305
They're not hurt, are they?

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:14.506
I hope not.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.242
But let's hurry back just
in case things got worse.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.878
[SHIRAHOSHI]
My father! No!

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:22.281
How could they do
such a thing to him?

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.916
To such a kind and gentle man!

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.020
[crying]

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.554
[JIMBEI]
I've failed you, Luffy.

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:34.826
I left you that message
to avoid a fight like this.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.763
I didn't want to get you
dragged into our struggles.

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:41.033
Yet here we are, and it's even
worse than I ever feared.

00:21:41.066 --> 00:21:42.067
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:47.039
[JIMBEI] We must make haste,
but humor me for a moment.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:48.874
There is something
I should have told Luffy

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:51.176
two years ago when we first met.

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:54.546
Though it means even more now.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:56.882
I owe a debt of gratitude

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:59.284
to the people who stopped
Arlong from running wild

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.652
in the East Blue.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.988
He had done more than
enough harm already.

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:08.327
I understand that it was
you who defeated him.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.298
So I express a long
overdue thank you for that.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:16.301
And though it pains me,
I must apologize as well.

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:20.005
Don't say it.

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:21.773
Eleven years ago,

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:23.842
Arlong was locked away
by the Government,

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.578
and even knowing what
evils he was capable of...

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:29.781
...I freed him.

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.361
[NARRATOR] As Jimbei reveals
a piece of history,

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.697
Nami remembers her tragic past.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.133
Sanji resents Jimbei
for his involvement,

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:23.201
but Nami gives him
a chance to speak.

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.771
The Fishman begins
a tale from years ago,

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:28.540
when two famous figures fought
to undo the animosity

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.243
that existed between
humans and his kind.

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:33.011
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:36.681
