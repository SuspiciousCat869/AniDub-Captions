to pay me off.

But then, while I was making
plans to buy a pirate ship

you I was attacked by pirates

and I eventually drifted ashore
to this god‐forsaken island?

Well, naturally I managed
to protect the cash.

my life for that money.

Come, bring your ship out!

350
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,892
That's fine, we were
thinking of leaving anyway.

351
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,794
We'll be heading
out in a minute.

352
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,433
[USOPP] Here you go,
old man, I fixed it for ya.

353
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,734
[ZENNY]
I should have known.

354
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,635
Thank you.

355
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,670
Don't mention it‐‐
it was my pleasure.

356
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,573
[SANJI] Everything is
set up through supper.

357
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,308
All you have to do is heat it.

358
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,644
Thanks. Much obliged.

359
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,279
Say, um, listen, you guys.

360
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,680
Are you sure about this?

361
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,649
I mean, you are going
to be facing a fleet

362
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,850
of nine ships!

363
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,652
[LUFFY]
Don't worry about it.

364
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:38,590
I'm not only strong,
I'm also incredibly lucky.

365
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,660
I can't keep up with you, sonny.

366
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,928
Old‐timer.

367
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,430
I made up a
whole supply for you,

368
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,365
so I want you to
take your medicine.

369
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,633
Promise me, okay?

370
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,802
All right, all right, relax.

371
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,671
I promise to take it just
like I'm supposed to.

372
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,978
We had a real
good time, old man!

373
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,380
Take good care of yourself.

374
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,949
Hey, you guys!
Take care of the old man, okay?

375
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,617
[GOATS bleat]

376
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,986
We'll see you out
on the sea sometime!

377
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,121
Yeah!

378
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,390
Once I finish making repairs
to the good ship Zenny,

379
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,493
my boys and I'll
be setting sail!

380
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,896
[LUFFY] We'll be waiting
for you, Zenny Pirates!

381
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,069
[GOAT G bleats]

382
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,573
[ZENNY] Well, let's head back
to the island for a while.

383
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,808
We have to fix the ship.

384
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,543
All right, get ready.

385
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,744
We're heading back.

386
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:38,050
[GOATS bleat]

387
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,229
So age doesn't have
anything to do with

388
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,231
becoming a pirate, huh, son?

389
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,435
That kid really knows
how to get an idea

390
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,571
into someone's head.

391
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,340
That Chopper's a pretty
determined one too.

392
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,442
I wonder how many years I'll
need to take this whole stack

393
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,510
of medicine.

394
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,748
Much obliged, everyone.

395
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,650
Very much obliged.

396
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,319
Thanks to you,
I think I can tough it out

397
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,820
a little while longer.

398
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,260
Besides, my life as a pirate
is only just beginning.

399
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,264
[laughing]

400
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,439
[NAMI] Gotta say, that was
pretty shrewd thinking,

401
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,441
luring them into
this foggy reef area.

402
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,643
You really use your
head sometimes, Luffy.

403
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,812
Huh? What's that?

404
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,216
Oh, right, of course not,
you weren't thinking at all!

405
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,717
[MARINE 7]
This is Captain Moore's fleet,

406
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,786
calling all ships in this
quadrant of the sea!

407
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,621
Requesting immediate assistance!

408
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,790
Repeat, this is
Captain Moore's fleet!

409
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,692
[NAMI] You are such a moron!
I take it back!

410
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,794
I wish I'd never
complimented you!

411
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,995
[LUFFY]
What?

412
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,798
It's not like he really planned
for that to happen, is it?

413
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,466
Ah, it was just dumb luck.

414
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,203
He was just pointing
in a random direction!

415
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,304
[SANJI, USOPP]
Eh.

416
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,344
Listen, ship's doctor.

417
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,679
How's the old man doing, really?

418
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,214
Will he be all right?

419
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,418
The medicine I gave
him will help him

420
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,721
to control his episodes,
but it won't keep him

421
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,156
from getting any worse.

422
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,659
His heart was fairly
weak to begin with,

423
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,729
and old as he is,
trying to sail a ship,

424
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,498
let alone lead
a pirate's life...

425
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,566
Will you stop worrying?

426
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,768
The old goat man said
he wanted to be a pirate,

427
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,237
so let's let him be one.

428
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,339
Besides, once the old‐timer
sets out to sea,

429
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,675
he may find an island that
has a cure for his illness

430
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,844
and then everything
will be fine.

431
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,679
I guess so.

432
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,748
[ZORO] I don't think we
have much to worry about.

433
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,852
That old guy isn't
gonna croak that easily.

434
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,587
Maybe he does have a weak heart,

435
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,857
but he's also got plenty
of guts to make up for it.

436
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,227
Zoro's right, Chopper.
We'll see Zenny again.

437
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,266
You bet!

438
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:50,542
