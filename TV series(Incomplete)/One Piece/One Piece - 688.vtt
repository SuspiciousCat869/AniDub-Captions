00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.803
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:16.225
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:18.196
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.501
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:23.306
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.212
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.684
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:30.722
a barrier known
as the "Birdcage"

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:33.126
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.529
If they can't deliver
the heads of Luffy

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:37.401
and 11 other enemies of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.405
everyone in the
kingdom will die.

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:41.309
Hunted by countless adversaries,

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:44.248
Luffy rushes to the royal
palace to defeat Doflamingo

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:47.321
and put an end to his massacre.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:53.033
All right, Gum-Gum... Gatling!

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.270
Move it!

00:03:58.443 --> 00:03:59.946
[NARRATOR] While the
members of the Straw Hats

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.220
and the Don Quixote Family are
clashing all across Dressrosa,

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:06.794
Sabo faces Navy Admiral
Fujitora alone.

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:10.367
But not before
exchanging a few words.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.538
Giving cover to pirates?

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:16.045
Is that the
Revolutionary Army's job?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.415
[SABO]
It is now.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:21.222
And I think I can say that,
as chief of staff.

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:23.627
Moreso. I say that...

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.467
...ss a brother. Heh.

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:31.476
[SABO]
Mark my words.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.514
No matter where I am.

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:35.685
No matter what I'm doing.

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:38.691
Even if I must
abandon my duties.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:41.363
The moment that Luffy
needs my help,

00:04:41.396 --> 00:04:43.366
I won't let him down.

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.444

[MARINES gasp]

I'll protect you!

[moos]

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.630
That's the coliseum's
grim reaper!

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:34.035
But why does it have
Straw Hat on its back?

00:05:34.068 --> 00:05:36.071
Don't chicken out now, man!

00:05:36.105 --> 00:05:37.976
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C]
Everybody, aim for the bull!

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.180
Keep firing 'til it goes down!

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.215
And Straw Hat, too?

00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:42.384
Are you kidding?

00:05:42.418 --> 00:05:44.254
There's no way we
can win against him!

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.826
If we slow 'em down,
that's enough!

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.699
As long as we keep him away
from the palace, we're good!

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.970
He'll lose the game eventually!

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:52.926
Damn it!

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.230
I thought I was taking
a shortcut for sure!

There's no point in reaching
the palace if I can't fight.

At this rate, Doflamingo
will just kill me.

Easy.

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:34.394
[KELLY HENCHMAN A] Damn, boss,
that's brutal, but also genius!

00:13:34.427 --> 00:13:39.037
[KELLY laughs]

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.481
I see!

00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:19.050
No way.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.143
They're beetles!

00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:35.050
[CUB]
All clear!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:38.557
Closer! Closer! Closer!

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:39.592
You got it!

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:40.861
Bring it in!

00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:42.931
Perfect!

00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:53.753
[CUB]
Looking good, team!

00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:56.727
[LEO]
All right! Step forward.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.129
We're all ready to go.

00:14:58.162 --> 00:15:00.233
It's time to take to the skies!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.538
Just board the Yellow Cubs!

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.064
[LEO]
Hm? Guys? Is something wrong?

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.402
They're too small!

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:19.939
[ROBIN]
Um...

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.110
Yep.

00:15:22.144 --> 00:15:24.147
What's the problem?

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.651
[CUB]
You've got the wrong idea.

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:29.357
Here, hold onto these ropes.
One in each hand.

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:35.637
Uh-oh.

00:15:36.807 --> 00:15:38.375
He's nuts.

00:15:38.408 --> 00:15:39.244
We're too heavy!

00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:41.381
There's no way
they can carry us!

00:15:41.415 --> 00:15:43.887
Let's leave the bugs
and run instead.

00:15:43.921 --> 00:15:45.891
Yep. Yep. That
sounds much better.

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:48.062
Now. I'll tell you
how this works.

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:50.433
You aren't listening, are ya?

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:52.204
[LEO]
This is the Tontatta Airlines

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:54.374
Special Jumping Service.

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:57.681
Big People are too heavy to
fly on their backs, after all.

00:15:57.714 --> 00:15:59.351
[BARTOLOMEO]
Oh, yeah, you think?

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:01.455
Is this normal?

00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:03.426
No. Not that I've seen.

00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:05.496
[LEO]
There's no more time to explain!

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.701
Get a running start
and take off!

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:10.172
[REBECCA, BARTOLOMEO gasp]

00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:13.646
[REBECCA screams]

00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:21.362
We're not flying, we're falling!

00:16:21.395 --> 00:16:23.701
Leo! Please don't
kill our friends!

00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:25.436
Hey! Are you all right?

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.039
[BARTOLOMEO]
If I fall to my death,

00:16:27.073 --> 00:16:29.946
I'm gonna haunt you runts!

00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:31.448
That sounds bad.

00:16:31.482 --> 00:16:33.587
[gasping]

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.057
[REBECCA screams]

00:16:41.937 --> 00:16:43.540
[gasping]

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:48.315
This is like flying.

00:16:48.348 --> 00:16:51.856
If nothing else, we can
make you all fall slowly.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.225
Falling is falling--

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:56.332
How the hell do you
call this an airline? [gasps]

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:58.737
Those buildings are
getting closer and closer!

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.039
[LEO]
It's fine! Relax!

00:17:00.072 --> 00:17:03.045
And how is this relaxing?
I'm gonna crash!

00:17:03.078 --> 00:17:05.016
[LEO]
Try to aim for a rooftop.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:07.487
Huh? A rooftop?

00:17:07.521 --> 00:17:11.696
[LEO] Yeah, that's it!
Land softly and keep running.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.510
[LEO]
Now, go! Jump!

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:20.379
[screams]

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:32.237
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]
I'm flyin'!

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.041
[LEO] If you keep
kicking off of rooftops,

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.376
you can stay in the air!

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:38.784
I see! So we just leapfrog
straight to the field!

00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:40.085
Uh-huh!

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.827
Very clever!

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.864
I think I'm catching on!

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.280
[LEO]
Wow! You're really soaring!

00:17:57.253 --> 00:18:02.531
[BARTOLOMEO laughs]
Guys, I feel like a balloon!

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:05.436
Someone still might
attack us, so watch out.

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:09.545
Otherwise, just head for the
fourth level of the big plateau!

00:18:09.578 --> 00:18:10.547
Roger that!

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.683
Roger that!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:12.818
Got it!

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:29.250
[FRANKY grunts]

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:34.628
[SEÑOR]
Swim. Swim. Swim. Swim.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:47.154
[groans] Enough with the
swimming, you jackass!

00:18:47.187 --> 00:18:49.257
Just fight me already!

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.802
[FRANKY gasps]

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:03.218
[FRANKY groaning]

00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:06.760
[WOMEN] Ew! Don't show us
your junk, you creep!

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.863
Too much? Stop watching.

00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:11.970
'Cause this is what it
looks like when men fight.

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:15.276
[WOMEN gasp]
So hard-boiled!

00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:18.850
[FRANKY] It's gonna take
more than cuddles to beat me.

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:21.589
Strong Right!

00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:33.813
[FRANKY] Huh?
Disappearing again? Damn it.

00:19:33.846 --> 00:19:35.550
[SEÑOR chuckles]

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:36.619
Huh?

00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:44.300
[SEÑOR]
That was some punch. Not bad.

00:19:46.573 --> 00:19:47.874
Try again.

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:51.248
Fraland.

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.452
[WICCA]
Inhel, what should we do?

00:19:53.485 --> 00:19:57.027
I might have
come up with a plan.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.462
Go on.

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:16.665
Bastard! How dare you
step on my sword!

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.306
Did I? Too bad.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:21.776
[PICA]
I'll kill you!

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:28.857
You really like
hearing yourself squeak.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.060
And that sword is way too big.

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:33.733
You overcompensating
for something?

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:40.680
Two-Sword Style!

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:45.924
[gasps] I see.
That's how it works.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:00.052
Let's end this right now. Ready?

00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:12.176
I think we've given
him plenty of time.

00:21:12.209 --> 00:21:14.481
Let's go, Kelly.

00:21:14.515 --> 00:21:15.650
Right.

00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:21.261
[KELLY HENCHMAN B groans]

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.398
[groans]

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:29.611
[BULL moos]

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.551
Hey. One second.

00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:33.485
Huh?

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:37.160
Feels like this passage
is sloping down.

00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.763
Y'think so?

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.838
Turn back!
This place is flooded!

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:49.250
[LUFFY] Huh. I thought this
was supposed to be a shortcut

00:21:49.284 --> 00:21:51.689
to the top of the plateau.

00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:59.237
[LUFFY]
It's a dead end!

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.208
[LAW]
Get out! Hurry!

00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:03.345
[LUFFY]
Don't panic, Moocy!

00:22:03.378 --> 00:22:08.589
[footsteps]

00:22:11.061 --> 00:22:13.666
Huh? Someone's coming.

00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:27.827
[gasps]

00:22:42.957 --> 00:22:46.331
[DOFLAMINGO] This is nothing
but a sideways water well.

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:49.237
More of a trap than
a shortcut, really.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.673
[gasps]

00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:09.043
[LUFFY]
It's you! Doflamingo!

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:17.293
[NARRATOR] Trapped inside
a well with no room to escape,

00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:18.763
Luffy is knocked into the water

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.667
after an assault
from Doflamingo.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.405
Far from his destination,
far from his friends,

00:23:23.438 --> 00:23:25.577
and unable to free Law
from his handcuffs,

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.681
Luffy bets everything
on one giant attack

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:30.052
to bring him a
last-minute comeback!

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:31.522
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:33.158
"A Great Escape!

00:23:33.192 --> 00:23:35.664
Luffy's Tide-turning
Elephant Gun!"

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.803
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
