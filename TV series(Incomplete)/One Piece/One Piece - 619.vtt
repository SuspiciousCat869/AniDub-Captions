00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:06.039
â™ª Opening Song

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.698
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.601
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:46.806
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.342
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.612
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.447
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.850
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.886
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.190
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.825
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.562
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:13.833
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.571
[NARRATOR] At long last, the
Straw Hat Pirates have reached

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.841
the waters of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.710
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:27.147
an island divided into
freezing and burning halves.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.482
There, they soon discover
the twisted motives

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:33.319
behind the ruler of the island,
the mad scientist Caesar Clown.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.322
Along with their pirate ally,
the Warlord Trafalgar Law,

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.358
the Straw Hats have
three objectives:

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:41.761
successfully kidnap Caesar,
save the children test subjects,

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.763
and find a way to
escape from Punk Hazard

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.299
before the lab
collapses on them!

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.968
[gasps] Wait a sec!

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.806
[LUFFY] "Running Wild!
Invincible General Franky!"

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.989
[FRANKY]
General Left!

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.529
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.465
[BUFFALO gasps]

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:26.766
[BABY 5 yelps]

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:29.435
[BUFFALO]
Mayday, Mayday!

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.170
[BABY 5]
You okay, Buffalo?

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.739
[BUFFALO]
Baby, what is that thing?

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.275
[BABY 5]
How am I supposed to know?

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.445
[BABY 5] Jerk didn't even
give us a warning shot!

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.315
[BABY 5]
Not again!

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.689
For a second there, I could
have sworn that thing was

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:51.491
some kind of Pacifista.

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.892
But when the hell
has Caesar ever been

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.494
interested in human weapons?

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.762
Get me in range!

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.031
[BUFFALO]
Coming right up!

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.334
Whatever it is,
he'll regret shooting at us!

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.010
If you wanted a fight,
well here it is!

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.966
[BABY 5] Guess we'll never
know what his story was now.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.935
Such a tragedy.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.415
Hurry, everybody,
get aboard the train!

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:50.983
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.752
[MARINE I]
There's room on the front car!

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.853
[MARINE J]
Watch your step!

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.355
[MARINE K]
Pick up the pace, kiddies!

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:56.856
[MARINE L]
We gotta hurry up!

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.292
[MARINE M] The building's
gonna collapse soon!

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.827
[ALL panting]

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.228
[GIRL D]
I can't climb up!

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.863
[MARINE N]
You can do it! Come on!

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.965
There's still no sign of
Chopper and Brook.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.834
Yeah. Time's up.

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.102
It's too dangerous.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:10.670
We can't wait here any longer!

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.205
Just to get everything
straight here,

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:13.673
where does this passage lead to?

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:16.075
Away from the laboratory,
and straight to a harbor

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.378
where we'll find
a tanker waiting for us.

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.380
[NAMI]
It's not safe to go outside!

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.181
The gas is covering the island!

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:25.351
[LAW] We have to risk exposure
in order to reach the transport.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.120
It's our only option.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:29.322
Or we can stay and
be buried in the rubble.

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.623
What about the children?

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.992
[GIRL A] Hey, you don't
need to worry about us!

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:35.094
We all want off
this island, okay?

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.996
We'll do anything
to get back home!

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.231
She's right!

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:40.933
Even if we have to hold our
breath all the way to the ship!

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:44.036
Yeah, whatever we got to do to
see our moms and dads again!

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.906
[SYND] We know the danger
and we're ready to face it!

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:49.709
[CHILDREN]
We just wanna go home!

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.445
You're right.

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.514
There's no turning back.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:57.383
We move forward and
leave the rest to fate!

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.418
Listen up, kids!

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.586
I promise you all
whatever it takes.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.790
We're shippin' outta Punk
Hazard and getting you home!

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:07.260
[CHILDREN]
Yeah!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.501
[BUFFALO]
Coast is clear!

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:18.137
Let's grab double C
and vamoose outta here!

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:21.107
Yeah. Enough of all
the dilly dallying.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.175
[BABY 5 gasps]

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:41.561
[FRANKY]
General A-okay!

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.362
I didn't even put a dent in him!

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.965
Who is this dude?

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.801
[FRANKY]
All right, my turn!

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.105
[FRANKY]
General...

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:53.873
...Shield!

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:55.641
That's too little and too late!

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:58.211
It's too little? Too late?

00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.046
My ears deceive me.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:03.649
You wouldn't dare accuse Franky
of incompetence, would ya?

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:05.518
Well, since you brought it up...

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:07.653
[FRANKY] Don't underestimate
General Franky,

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.188
the pervert robot!

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:10.089
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:14.827
[FRANKY]
General Shield! Uh...

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.629
Oh, take your time,
why don't you!

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:17.563
[FRANKY]
Let's see...

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.999
Maybe I can, uh, use it
like a projectile?

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.167
Uhh... Boomerang!

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.168
He threw his shield?

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.170
Talk about desperate!

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.408
Well then.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.745
Looks like I'm just gonna
have to break out the big guns.

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:33.946
Sorry, pal.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.382
As long as you're standing
between us and Caesar,

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:39.585
I'm afraid that
makes you our enemy.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.787
[FRANKY]
Throwing down her weapons.

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.924
What, does that mean she's
givin' up the fight already?

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:48.060
Oh, the real fight is
just getting started.

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:50.530
Weapon-morphosis!

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.735
[FRANKY]
Well that was unexpected.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.253

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:14.921

round and round and round

[FRANKY] Very interesting!

Pathetic!

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:41.113
[BUFFALO]
We're gonna recycle you, punk!

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:47.753
[FRANKY] Impressive,
Fan Man and Weapon Girl!

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.322
Really, not bad at all!

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.991
You are just starving
for a fight. Huh?

00:09:52.024 --> 00:09:55.027
[FRANKY] My only concern
is protecting the Sunny!

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.197

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.069
What were you saying about
no more getting sidetracked?

00:10:03.102 --> 00:10:05.638
Time for a more direct approach!

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:09.609
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.978
Call me Missile Girl!

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.112
Target is in sight!

Caesar's coming with us!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.523
[FRANKY] Wait, Caesar?
What're you even talking about?

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.759
General Left!

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.136
Whatta big finish!

[CAESAR CLOWN]
Where the hell am I?

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.873
[CAESAR CLOWN]
I can't even lift a finger.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:17.543
This can't be how the
brilliant Caesar goes out!

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:21.113
Dammit! Why did those three
have to team up?

Vice Admiral Smoker.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:12:00.186
What a wonderful
souvenir. Thanks.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.988
With this, the fight is over.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.563
[cackles]

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:14.533
Smoker! Your heart
is still in my hands.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.169
And I'm not going to hell alone!

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.305
[cackles]

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.140
I can't watch you die in person,

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:23.909
but I see it in my
head oh so clearly.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:26.412
Your eyes wide in terror,
spewing up blood,

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:29.115
the life slowly
extinguishing from you.

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:32.718
Fear spreading to everyone
nearby like a disease!

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.321
I can barely hold
the blade steady!

Whoa, what's going on?
Why's the door closing?

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.500
Hey! What's that?

[MARINES]
Land of the Dead!

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:59.378
[MARINE O]
No shoving! One at a time!

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:14.059
The hell're you Straw Hats
standing around and waiting for?

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.099
[LAW]
We can't let Caesar escape!

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.635
Or the entire plan
will be for nothing!

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.236
All of you, get on now!

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.337
Sure, we will.

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.439
When we have everyone!

I'm waiting for my whole crew!

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:33.045
Mocha's not here either!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:38.017

unaccounted for, too!

life depends on it!

We're trying the
best we can, Usopp!

[MARINES] We're the ones
doing the running here!

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.517
[USOPP] You gotta move
faster than the gas!

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.086
Hurry! The gate is
starting to close!

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:17.223
Only fifty meters left!
Then you're home free!

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.725
[SUBORDINATE E] The building's
gonna collapse any minute!

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.827
Time to take my own advice!

Damn it, me!

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.532
I forgot about the
Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:27.700
Shot in the dark here,

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.635
but do you know where I can
find any Sea Prism Stone?

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:31.203
[SUBORDINATE A]
Handcuffs? Like these?

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.371
You're kidding!

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:33.906
[SUBORDINATES]
No! We all have a pair!

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:35.307
[USOPP]
I just need one!

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:38.410
Don't ever let anyone tell you
it's wrong to ask for help!

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:39.411
[SUBORDINATE B]
We're coming with you!

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:40.546
Huh?

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:42.581
None of us can stand the
thought of dying down here.

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.950
Not after what that
bastard Caesar did to us!

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.185
We're going with you!

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.519
[USOPP]
Whatever floats your boat!

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.789
Chopper, Brook! Get to safety!

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.191
[CHOPPER]
The gate's gonna close!

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.826
[ALL panting]

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.294
[MARINE H]
We're dead! So dead!

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:56.662
[MARINE G]
We won't make it!

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.364
[BROOK] It's only over
when you give up!

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.833
And I've got no plans
for dying today!

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:02.601
[MARINE H]
But the gas is right behind us!

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.802
[MARINE G]
We're done for!

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.304
[BROOK gasps]

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.705
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:34.433
[CHOPPER]
Luffy!

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.435
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.609
They're here!

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:45.611
[CHOPPER]
Hey! Did you miss us?

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.546
[CHILDREN]
Mocha!

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.782
What a relief.

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.450
[USOPP]
Hey!

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:54.086
[BROOK laughs]

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:55.854
That was a close call!

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.423
The crew's all here!

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.291
Were you trying to
make us worry?

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:00.859
I knew you'd make it!

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:02.761
[CHOPPER]
It was all thanks to you, Usopp!

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.597
[MARINES] That's strange!
We didn't see him carrying you!

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.599
Enough with the
reunion! Let's go!

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.502
[LUFFY chuckles]
Well, guys, you heard 'im!

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.271
No reason to wait around, right?

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.707
All right, lackeys!
Follow me onto that train!

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.141
And they're gone.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.643
[SUBORDINATES]
What're you waiting for?

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:18.844
How'd they move so fast?

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:22.548
All aboard! Time to
get outta here!

00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.417
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.019
What about Kin'emon?

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:29.254
Is there anything
we can do for him?

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:31.423
What? That's Kin'emon?

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:35.060
We're just gonna have to
figure somethin' out later.

00:16:35.094 --> 00:16:39.631
[MOMONOSUKE]
No! What did they do to you?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:46.372
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.073
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cu-lick!

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:53.178
[MONET panting]

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:56.648
[MONET]
Joker. Are you there?

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:12.898
[MONET]
It's me... Monet...

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:14.466
[DOFLAMINGO]
Monet?

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.069
I'm surprised you're alive.

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.438
Vergo's been defeated.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.641
[DOFLAMINGO]
Caesar as well.

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:27.413
Though Baby 5 and Buffalo should
be able to recover him soon.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:30.682
[MONET]
I see. That's good to hear.

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:33.552
[DOFLAMINGO]
I feel sorry for you all.

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:36.922
I misjudged the whole situation.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.759
[DOFLAMINGO]
No more games.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:43.595
I want them all wiped out
in one fell swoop.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:46.965
[ALL screaming]

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:50.969
[LUFFY laughs]
Yee-hoo!

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:53.138
[DOFLAMINGO] Deep in the third
lab, you'll find the weapon

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.642
responsible for destroying
the first two laboratories,

00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:01.346
as well as the rest of the
island exactly four years ago.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.415
With the simple
push of a button,

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:08.187
Punk Hazard's population will be
reduced to a single person.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.091
The only one who can survive
the Land of the Dead,

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.726
our dear friend, Caesar.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.195
The location of the device--

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:19.298
You don't need to say
another word, Joker.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.869
[MONET]
I was going to do it anyway.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:29.808
[MONET] Actually, I'm next to
the switch right now.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:35.347
[MONET] The explosion will sink
their only means of escape.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.584
Just as long as you you're
okay with losing a tanker.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.919
Very good.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.222
Die for me, Monet.

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:45.691
And take everything with you.

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:56.268
[MONET]
Understood... Young Master.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.637
[CAESAR CLOWN]
At the very least,

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:09.875
I'll get my revenge
on you, Smoker!

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.378
[DOFLAMINGO]
This is goodbye.

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:16.982
Sorry it had to end
like this, old friend.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:24.423
Thank you...
for your years of service.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.854
[MONET]
Farewell, Young Master.

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.457
[MONET] Though I won't
be around to see it,

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:35.160
I know you'll become...

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:40.165
[MONET]
...the King of the Pirates.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.271
[NARRATOR]
After Monet sacrifices her life

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.706
for Doflamingo's sake,

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:23.241
Punk Hazard faces
utter annihilation,

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.043
and Luffy finds
himself enveloped by

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:27.612
a bright flash of light
as the Straw Hats continue

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.414
to race through the long tunnel.

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.283
Little do they know
that a shocking development

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.951
awaits just ahead!

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:34.986
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.724
"A Critical Situation!
Punk Hazard Explodes!"

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:41.893
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
