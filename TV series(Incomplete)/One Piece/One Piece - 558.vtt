[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.274
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:11.044
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.279
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.581
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.682
You can have it!

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.518
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.787
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.756
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.960
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.159
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:42.095
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:47.367
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.469
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.837
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.139
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.974
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.410
this has proven to be
the end of the road,

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.113
a graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.751
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.386
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.056
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:14.260
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.065
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.834
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.905
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.241
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:33.112
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.981
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.283
get pulled into the conflict

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.787
and find themselves in
the midst of an all-out war!

[SURUME growls]

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.494
[LUFFY] You wanted to
save your brother's life,

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.331
so you did whatever
this jerk told you?

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.366
I know what that's like.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.302
So is he your big brother,
or your little brother?

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.373

After all...

I... I don't understand.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.943
[NEPTUNE]
Why is it moving?

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:46.913
Wh-Who is doing this? And how?

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:50.149
This is a terrible development!

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.885
You must forgive
my ignorance, Father, but...

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.155
...I don't understand why
you're so upset by its presence.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.458
While I do admit
that it's strange,

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.860
the ship itself
is nothing more than a relic.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.796
It has no purpose today.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.131
[NEPTUNE]
You're wrong!

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:08.234

anything happen to that ship!

You see, my son,

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:15.675
until the intended day, that
vessel was not to be moved

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.877
from its resting place!

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.920
Are you okay, Captain?

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.288
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B]
I thought after he took

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.658
all those Energy Steroids,
nothing could stand up to him!

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.627

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.393
Wow.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:50.029
I really didn't think he'd
get back up after that one.

00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.398
I guess this guy's
no joke after all.

00:13:55.634 --> 00:13:56.802
[HORDY]
Hmm?

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.306
Is he out of his mind?

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.341
What the hell is
Decken thinking?

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:05.344
That bastard is about
to ruin all my hard work!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:20.025
[DECKEN laughing]

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:24.430
Why, hello, Shirahoshi!

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.098
I offer you my love.

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.566
One last time!

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.269
[laughs]

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:54.994
[laughing continues]

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.295
[DECKEN]
What do you say?

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.763
Do you want me?

00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:00.466
[laughs]

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.101
How can this be?

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:03.869
It's coming for the princess?

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.604
Don't tell me!

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:08.107
Decken must have thrown the
Noah like he threw those axes

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.508
and letters before!

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.710
For ten years,
I've been pining for you,

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.780
waiting for the day
I could make you mine!

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:17.616
See? Love's patient, I suspect.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.652
That means there isn't another
person alive who could

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.954
care for you like I do!

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:23.889
That's why I'm doing this!

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:26.358
It's love! Love!

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:30.429
L! U! V! Love!

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:33.866
Why won't you accept it?

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.735
By now you know about
my Mark-Mark Fruit powers.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.705
The things I throw with
this ability don't stop unless

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:43.075
they hit their target or
crash into something else!

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.510
So here's Noah!

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:47.279
This giant ship embodies
my love for you!

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:49.048
It's yours for the taking!

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:52.985
My feelings will be the last
thing you feel as it crushes

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:56.121
the entirely of Fishman Island!

00:15:56.155 --> 00:16:00.859
[laughs]

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:09.134
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:11.236
Captain Decken, wait!

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.838
How do I not die?

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.140
[laughs]

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:17.109
Sorry, pal!

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.746
You shoulda thought about
not dying before you fell off!

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.014
Them's the breaks!

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:24.616
You're just one more thing
I have to sacrifice

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.352
in my pursuit of Shirahoshi!

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.153
Oh, no!

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.492
Why's this happening?!

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:35.227
The bubble's about to pop!

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.029
We're doomed for sure!

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:40.265
Huh? Hey. Where did
Princess Shirahoshi go?

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.266
[SURUME gasps]

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.968
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE S]
She vanished!

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.503
This isn't good.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:47.439
Princess! Please,
you have to come back!

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:48.540
[LUFFY gasps]

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:52.945
[DECKEN] What's this? My
Shirahoshi has disappeared?

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:55.347
No. Not now.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.149
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I'm right here!

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.550
[gasps]

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.721
Not a good place for her!

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.056
[gasps]

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.257
[NAMI, BROOK gasp]

Wah!

[SHIRAHOSHI panting]

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.210
Princess Shirahoshi!

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.945
When'd she get up there?

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.849
Weepyhoshi...

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.885
Please, don't die!

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:35.888
Come back down!
What do you think you're doing?

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:37.856
She's changing
the ship's trajectory!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.059
By moving herself away
from the island!

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.994
What? But she--!

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:44.897
[SHIRAHOSHI panting]

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.975
[panting continues]

00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:01.013
Wah! Now that's exactly what
I'd expect from my dream girl!

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:03.549
[panting]

00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:05.451
I knew you were awful!

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:08.120
But I never believed you
would stoop this low!

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:17.696
If you want to take my life,

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.731
then I am powerless to stop you!

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.867
But no one else
should have to suffer!

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.203
I won't let you
harm this kingdom!

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.472
I will protect it with my life!

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.809
So come get me, you monster!

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:31.910
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.345

No!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE S gasps]

00:18:58.237 --> 00:19:01.907
Look at that!
Its changing direction!

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.342
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE T]
But it's still heading

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:06.445
right for the princess!

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.113
Just get away!

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.016
[JIMBEI growls]

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.751
What can we do now?

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.753
There has to be something!

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:22.561
Figures.

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:25.797
That's what I get for
teaming up with a madman.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.033
I expected he
might kill a few commoners,

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:31.336
but now I see he'd just
as soon kill me, too.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.671
[growls]

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:35.073
I won't stand for betrayal.

[panting]

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:41.914
[FISHMAN N] Please!
Don't sacrifice yourself for us!

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.550
[FISHMAN O] We have to
do something to save her!

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:50.889
[laughs]

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.791
Lovely!

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:56.195
Your beauty is
so much more than skin deep!

00:19:56.228 --> 00:20:00.232
Faced with impossible odds, you
take matters into your own hands

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.734
to save the countless
innocents I hope to crush

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.469
for no good reason!

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:08.874

[DECKEN growls]

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.448
This is so unfair.

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:21.119
[DECKEN] As I always suspected,
you are the perfect woman

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:24.223
to become Mrs. Vander
Decken the Ninth!

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:26.225
[laughs]

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.627
But since you insist
on rejecting me,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.897
I fear your beauty must
be resigned to history!

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.799
Now die!

Please, run away!

How could he do that to her?

[FISHMAN P]
Leave her alone!

Dammit, Weepyhoshi!

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.913

I could protect you!

He's tryin' to get away!

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.984
Hey, Captain Hordy, he--!

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.286
What the hell?!

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:30.022
Where did the Captain
run off to?!

Look up there!

happens to traitors,

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:55.480

I like this idea of yours!

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.837
Unforgivable!

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.373
I'll make him pay
for hurting the princess!

[LUFFY]
Sanji! Hold it!

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:23.775

Huh?

sI'll go! You take
care of the plaza!

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.281
[SANJI]
Are you sure?

00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:32.984
Think about it, Luffy!
The ship's in the water!

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:35.754
But the ship's in a bubble,
so it should be okay!

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:37.255
That would make sense.

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:40.258
Decken is weak to
seawater, just like you.

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:44.062
Despite being a fishman, he
needs air to move around freely.

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.065
Better safe than sorry, though.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.768
Take this bubbly coral.

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.169

letting you save the girl!

[NARRATOR] Shirahoshi
flees into the open sea,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.563
hoping to draw the Noah away
from Fishman Island.

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:21.700
With a littel help from his
friends, Luffy chases after her,

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.069
but is halted by Hordy,
who easily bests

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:26.571
the land-dwelling
pirate underwater.

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.740
Then suddenly,
an act of savagery from

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:32.878
the ferocious fishman throws the
conflict into utter chaos.

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:34.546

On the next One Piece!
