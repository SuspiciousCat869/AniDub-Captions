1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,371
Long Nose?! Is that you?!

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,540
Now, Mr. Wet Noodle,

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,109
while we're at it,
try this one on for size!

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,411
Ramen Kenpo!

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,579
Multi-Noodle Spank!

6
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,662
A chef must fight without
using his hands or knives.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,863
Those are sacred.

8
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,601
So it's always been my policy
not to use them in battle.

9
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,135
But, since we're in a kitchen

10
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,671
and you're using
food as a weapon.

11
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,741
That changes things
a bit, now doesn't it?

12
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,743
It's time for a demonstration.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,148
This is how a real chef

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,585
gracefully handles
his kitchen knives.

15
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,133
I've had enough of you!

16
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,500
Likewise!

17
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,607
What the hell are you?!

18
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,246
Where'd all that
kenpo spirit go?

19
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,116
You gotta burn off all
those carbs, you know.

20
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,120
Damn it you crook cook!
Don't talk saucy to me!

21
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,622
My awesome noodle
fists are all gone!

22
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,757
What am I?

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,294
An onion?!

24
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,361
If you're an onion,

25
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,630
you're gonna make yourself
cry if you keep this up.

26
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,632
Just quit while you're ahead.

27
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,734
I won't cry and I won't quit!

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,236
Who said I was gonna lose?!

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,275
After all, I'm Wanze, CP7's ace!

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,245
I may look like I'm having fun,

31
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,647
but I take this
mission very seriously.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,482
The government's been
chasing Robin for years

33
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,351
and I'm not gonna
be the one to blow it

34
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,053
now that we finally have her!

35
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,187
So maybe you're the one

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,089
who should quit
while you're ahead!

37
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,291
Now Ramen Kenpo!

38
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,493
Noodle Nail Knockout!

39
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,602
When cutting an onion,

40
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,769
you need to sever the stem

41
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,505
and the root without
harming the flesh.

42
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,777
If you chop through the
fiber with one clean stroke

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,414
the surface will
retain its glossy shine.

44
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,650
Stop it!

45
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,484
Go away!

46
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,220
Ramen Beam!

47
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,426
Epluchage!

48
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,242
You know, I wouldn't expect
it of a third-rate cook

49
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,380
that blows ramen out of
his nose but I have to admit,

50
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,681
he takes good care
of his kitchen knives.

51
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,775
Well?

52
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,676
You like my star shield?

53
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,748
What's up with this guy's body?

54
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,617
There's no way a human
could do this stuff!

55
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,554
Spitting fire again?!

56
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:23,524
Master Nails!

57
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,558
Moon Walk!

58
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,430
Hey, stop jumping around!

59
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,699
We're getting nowhere!

60
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,567
I was hoping my Four
Powers would be enough,

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,701
but I guess not.

62
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,671
I'm afraid I haven't mastered
the Finger Pistol yet.

63
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,106
But I've got a little stand-in

64
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,442
that should do the
job quite nicely.

65
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,376
All right!

66
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,144
This is my chance
to go to the next car!

67
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,513
Hey, I thought we were
having a fight, here!

68
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,148
He thinks he's smart.

69
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,053
I got you now.

70
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,222
Beans Left!

71
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,459
Nice try.

72
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,730
But I saw that coming
from a mile away!

73
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,473
That hurt!

74
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,377
I get it.

75
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,580
You son of a bitch,
Ouchie Finger!

76
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,782
Shave!

77
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,816
This ain't good.

78
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,585
He's got my number now.

79
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,555
Tempest Kick!

80
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,190
Just grazed me!

81
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,059
He sure moves
around a lot, though.

82
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,231
I know your weak point!

83
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,566
It's your back, isn't it?

84
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,202
And that's not
counting your brain,

85
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,305
which is an obvious
weakness, too.

86
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,474
At this rate, it's only a matter
of time before you're finished.

87
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,410
Don't get ahead
of yourself, pal.

88
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:53,414
I got a move that'll get
rid of my weak point easy!

89
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,550
Franky Invincible!

90
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,684
Eat that!

91
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,090
Now do you give
up, weasel face?!

92
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,563
That's so stupid, I don't
even have a comeback.

93
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,538
What's going on?

94
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,174
How did you get here
in the first place?

95
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,542
This is dangerous, you know!

96
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,346
Ma'am, I can hardly answer

97
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,448
if you bombard me
with questions like that!

98
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,217
Let's just calm down
and take it slowly.

99
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,320
Ah, shall I pour you
some coffee, perhaps?

100
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,488
Stop fooling around!

101
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:39,794
What are you?

102
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,161
Pleased to meet you.

103
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,064
I'm Sniper King,
the King of the Snipers.

104
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,802
To make a long story short,
I've come to rescue you.

105
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,671
You're really serious.

106
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,473
I am not alone, of course.

107
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:55,376
Your friend Sanji and a
cyborg thug named Franky,

108
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:58,312
are currently engaged
in battle on this train.

109
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,515
They kept the enemy busy long
enough for me to come here.

110
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,550
Furthermore,
Captain Luffy and the rest

111
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,054
of the Straw Hats are following
closely on another Sea Train.

112
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,456
I hear he's bringing
a small army with him.

113
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:20,434
On my way here, I peeked
inside the other train cars.

114
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,336
Frankly, I believe
the four agents in

115
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:25,105
the car behind us may
prove too great a challenge.

116
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,641
If possible,
I would like to escape

117
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,076
with you before
Sanji has to face them.

118
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,120
Come, let's run away together!

119
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,128
What's the matter?

120
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,062
There's no need to worry.

121
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,199
I made all of the
necessary preparations.

122
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,534
Here.

123
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,369
These Octopu-shoes are for you.

124
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,271
If you use them on
your hands and feet,

125
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,272
you can climb through the window

126
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,541
and stick to the outer
panels of the sea train.

127
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,177
Quickly put them
on before they notice.

128
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,411
I won't go.

129
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,413
Why not?

130
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,350
I don't know why
you're doing this.

131
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,686
I told you very clearly
that I wouldn't see you again.

132
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,288
I said I would never
return to the Straw Hats!

133
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,730
The situation has changed.

134
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,165
They know why you
turned yourself in.

135
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:29,369
That Ice gentleman from the
shipyard clarified everything.

136
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,641
So he survived after all.

137
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,177
But still, that doesn't
change my mind.

138
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,413
I won't go with you,
no matter what.

139
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,515
Enough with that already!

140
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,649
Don't you get it?

141
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,053
They aren't so weak that
you need to worry about them!

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,390
What were you thinking,
accepting such a stupid deal

143
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,626
before talking to
the rest of the crew?!

144
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,361
You think they'd
be happy to go on,

145
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,130
knowing that
one of their friends

146
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,432
had thrown her
life away for them?

147
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,134
Now that they know why you left,

148
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,670
they'll follow you to the
depths of hell if they have to

149
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:06,640
and they'll bust every skull
they can on the way there!

150
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,808
You don't get it, do you?

151
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,278
That's the kind of guy Luffy is!

152
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,814
How many times do
I have to tell you this?!

153
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:17,284
Even if you think you can save
me, I don't want your help!

154
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,486
Don't you care how I feel?!

155
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,622
C'mon, gimme a break!

156
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,727
Hey, keep it down in there, you!

157
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,831
What's the matter?

158
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,034
Now that we're getting
closer to Enies Lobby

159
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,339
is that cool exterior of yours
finally starting to melt away?

160
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,307
Well, you can cry all you like

161
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,443
but there's no point
in lamenting your fate

162
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,812
after it's already been sealed.

163
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:47,447
Really, I'm fine.

164
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:50,284
Strange.

165
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,753
That's not the reaction
I was expecting.

166
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,422
I can't put my finger on it,

167
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,058
but there's something
different about her.

168
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:03,297
Maybe it's just my imagination?

169
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,833
I said I'm fine.

170
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,001
Now please, just leave me alone.

171
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,771
This is definitely fishy!

172
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,407
Why is she goofing off
at a time like this?

173
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,381
Rabbit Ears?

174
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,081
Hey!

175
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,750
Would you take this seriously?!

176
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,718
You can't just quit
'cause you were losing!

177
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,220
Get up and fight me!

178
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,355
I'll spit on you!

179
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,458
I'd watch my weasel mouth
if I were you, punk.

180
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:36,130
I'm not quitting,
I'm just getting started.

181
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,466
Anyway, this is
nothing but bad luck.

182
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,735
Well, bad luck for you, I mean.

183
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,504
I'm doing great.

184
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:50,210
Did I mention
I was super this week?

185
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,481
It's not a good time
to make me angry.

186
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,553
Let me ask you
something, brother.

187
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:03,257
Have you ever heard of the
creature they call a "Centaur"?

188
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,425
Hm?

189
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,126
You mean those
things that are human

190
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,562
from the waist up and like
a horse from the waist down?

191
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,097
Yeah, what about them?

192
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,536
Convert!

193
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,319
No way.

194
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:38,726
That's ridiculous!

195
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,796
Franky... Centaur Mode!

196
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:43,997
It's backwards!

197
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,167
Your head's supposed to be
in the front, not your crotch!

198
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,609
You call this backwards?

199
00:12:55,642 --> 00:13:00,180
Just wait 'til I rearrange
your face, weasel boy.

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,468
Are we there yet?

201
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,403
Where's Bashing Tom?

202
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,604
It's Puffing Tom!

203
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,040
Anyway, get inside
before you catch a cold!

204
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,609
You just changed clothes and
you're soaking wet already!

205
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,710
I don't care.

206
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,146
It's more awesome up here.

207
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,214
Fine.

208
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,750
Now, Gum-Gum-

209
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,321
Three Hundred Caliber-Cannon!

210
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:40,821
Boom!

211
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,389
Splash!

212
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,725
Ah! You defeated me!

213
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,195
Would all of you
stop screwing around?!

214
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,763
We're bored.

215
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,665
Then polish your
weapons or something!

216
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,834
What's wrong with you?!

217
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,337
Uh yeah.

218
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,739
I tried to tell those guys
the same thing earlier,

219
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,407
but they wouldn't listen to me.

220
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,641
Hm?

221
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,181
Hey, check it out!

222
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,516
There's a train in front of us!

223
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,721
It's the Puffing Tom!

224
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,727
Seems a bit early
don't you think?

225
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,595
Who's in my arpmit?!!

226
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:25,432
Ahh!! I can't move!!

227
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,002
Dammit!

228
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,638
What's gonna happen to us now?

229
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,139
There's no engine on this car.

230
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,775
All we can do is wait it out.

231
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:35,476
Ah!

232
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,610
Another wave!

233
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,179
Whoa, this storm
is still pretty bad.

234
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,115
You think someone
will come save us?

235
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,782
We're in big trouble
if they don't.

236
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,153
Hey, guys, there's something
approaching from behind!

237
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:46,787
Really?!

238
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,455
It must be a rescue ship!

239
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,324
I don't think so.

240
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,826
Actually, it looks like it's
coming on the railway.

241
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,495
There's no way.

242
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,430
There's only one sea
train in the world

243
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,698
and we're on it right now.

244
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,300
Besides, it's Aqua Laguna.

245
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,635
No one could make it out
of Water 7 in this weather.

246
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,304
Well, if it's not
a train, then...

247
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,378
...what the heck is it?

248
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,615
That's the Puffing Tom all
right but it's just the caboose.

249
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,483
There's no engine!

250
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,252
And it doesn't look
like it's moving!

251
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,253
That can't be right.

252
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,155
What's going on here?!

253
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,058
Does this mean it
got detached somehow?

254
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,159
Maybe something happened

255
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,428
and Sanji and
Usopp are on there!

256
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,363
Big Bro Franky, too!

257
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,733
Well, I hope not, cause we're
about to crash into 'em!

258
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,335
Granny, hit the brake!

259
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,503
I already told you,
now didn't I?

260
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,171
We don't got one!

261
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,374
We're gonna crash!

262
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:43,410
Luffy!

263
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,045
What are you gonna do?

264
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,481
I'm flying over
to see what's up!

265
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,351
Now Gum-Gum Rocket!

266
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,655
There's something in the sky!

267
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,031
What happened?

268
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,374
Ow, ow, ow.

269
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,208
All right!

270
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,376
I made it!

271
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,345
Who the hell is this weirdo?!

272
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,213
Hello?

273
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,180
Sanji!

274
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,581
Are you in here?

275
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,719
Or Usopp?

276
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,488
Hey, Sanji!

277
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,790
You hear me?

278
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,691
Maybe over there.

279
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,632
Wait a sec.

280
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,767
I know that face!

281
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,602
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

282
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,712
Hello?!

283
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,247
Are you there?

284
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,549
Sanji?

285
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,085
Shut up!

286
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:02,289
I can't hear!

287
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,390
B-Bring it on!

288
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,192
We're not scared of you!

289
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,193
Where's Sanji?

290
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:06,827
Wait, what?

291
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,128
I don't know who that is.

292
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,196
Sanji!

293
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,497
He's my friend!

294
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,499
Sorry, never heard of him!

295
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,468
Too bad.

296
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,070
See ya.

297
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,240
Shoot him!

298
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,046
Straw Hat's coming out!

299
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,051
Looks like they're shooting him,
and he's saying "no."

300
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:31,985
Well, whatever happened,

301
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,021
the train cars must
be full of Marines.

302
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,358
So what's the plan, Rope Man?

303
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,093
If we don't move
those cars outta the way,

304
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,493
we might get knocked off!

305
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,304
Holy crap, it is a
sea train after all!

306
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,538
They're gonna ram right into us!

307
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,507
Yeah and if they
don't slow down soon,

308
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,176
we're gonna get
smashed to pieces!

309
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,679
Let the Franky
Family handle this!

310
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:01,115
We'll dismantle 'em
before they can hit us!

311
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,216
Let me help!

312
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,084
I wanna break stuff too!

313
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:04,785
Hear that, men?

314
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,520
Get to work!

315
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,222
Yeah!

316
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,123
Hey!

317
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,125
Zoro!

318
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,593
Hear that, Roronoa?

319
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,395
He's calling for you!

320
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,329
Go ahead!

321
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:18,031
Cut 'em!

322
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,134
Okay.

323
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,768
That's it?!

324
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:30,744
Stop the train!

325
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,279
We'll die!

326
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,058
The ego of the entropic world.

327
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,362
Shall be rent in twain.

328
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,311
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

329
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,756
...Rashomon!

330
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:17,725
What?!

331
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:19,360
What?!!

332
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:24,564
What?!

333
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,416
Hey, if you're gonna do
something crazy like that,

334
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,285
you gotta warn us first!

335
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,153
You heard me say
"cut 'em" didn't you?

336
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,721
But I didn't think
he could actually do it!

337
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,423
Of course he could do it!

338
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,258
We'd be dead right
now if he couldn't!

339
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,294
Yeah, I guess that's true

340
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,729
but you're gonna
give me a heart attack!

341
00:19:55,762 --> 00:20:00,067
He's got all that power and he's
not even the leader of the crew?

342
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,403
Good thing we made
friends with those guys.

343
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,038
Anyway, that was awesome!

344
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:05,238
Nice work!

345
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,719
I still can't believe
there was another sea train.

346
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:22,489
They might even catch the
Puffing Tom with that speed.

347
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,625
This is bad but if
those guys rescue

348
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:27,227
the prisoners on the train,
we're totally screwed.

349
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,829
There's no way
that's gonna happen!

350
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,433
Remember, we still have
one last line of defense.

351
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,134
He's waiting for them!

352
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:36,704
That's right!

353
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,472
As long as we have
him in the Navy,

354
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,708
justice will always
find a way to win!

355
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:51,785
All right, here goes!

356
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:55,522
Two-Sword Style
Sword Draw Rashomon!

357
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,258
Hey! You're supposed
to be the train!

358
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:57,792
No way!

359
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,260
I wanna be Roronoa!

360
00:20:59,293 --> 00:20:59,960
Don't be a baby!

361
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,428
I don't wanna get cut in half!

362
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,363
Sure you do!

363
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,330
No way!

364
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,165
Hey guys!

365
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:09,436
We're not done yet.

366
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,071
What the hell is that?!

367
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:16,410
It's a Sea King!

368
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,712
That giant monster was--

369
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,515
Sashimi!

370
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,050
It's split in half!

371
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,518
Let's grill it up!

372
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,326
Someone killed that giant thing?

373
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:35,795
It was big enough to swallow
up Rocketman in one gulp!

374
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,673
There's someone
waiting on this railway.

375
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,778
Someone who can cut
Sea Kings in half.

376
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,728
Who the hell is that?!

377
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:15,295
Ahh!

378
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,064
That's the Ship-Slasher!

379
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,265
Ship-Slasher?

380
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:19,633
Ship-Slasher T-Bone!

381
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,535
A Captain from
Navy Headquarters!

382
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:25,306
He uses a straight sword to cut
through ships like a raw steak!

383
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:26,474
Sounds like fun.

384
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:29,443
Hey, Steak Man, draw your
sword, or get outta the way!

385
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,577
On the next One Piece:

386
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:35,282
"Clash! Demon-Slasher Zoro
vs. Ship-Slasher T-Bone!"

387
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
the King of Pirates!
