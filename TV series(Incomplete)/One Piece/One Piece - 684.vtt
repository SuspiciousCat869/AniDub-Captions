WEBVTT

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:31.851
[TEACH cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:34.155
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:35.991
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.471
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:37.715
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.688
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:46.032
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:47.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:51.577
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.514
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.657
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:03.467
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.785
[LUFFY] I’m gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.361
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:20.568
of the New World, the Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:23.173
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:25.678
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:28.349
Usopp freed citizens
who had been enslaved

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:29.920
and transformed into toys,

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.324
prompting Doflamingo
to trap the entire kingdom

00:03:32.358 --> 00:03:34.395
inside a barrier known
as the "“Birdcage"”

00:03:34.428 --> 00:03:37.267
and place bounties
on Luffy and his allies.

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.740
[PICA high-pitched]
Any fool who opposes our family

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:41.910
will be answering to me.

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:46.520
[PICA]
Now, step forward and fight!

00:03:46.553 --> 00:03:51.395
[laughs] His voice is so high!

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.436
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.642
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE R]
Run for it!

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:00.582
[yelling]

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.219
[LAW]
Faster! We’re gonna get crushed!

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:06.225
[screams]

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:07.695
[ZORO]
Luffy!

00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:10.568
[LUFFY yelping]

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:17.447
Luffy!

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:22.124
[LUFFY] "Gathering into
a Powerful Front!

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:24.996
Luffy and a Group
of Brutal Warriors!"

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.813
What’s goin' on now?

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.415
[whimpering]

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:37.488
My hand! I can’t...

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:39.258
I can’t hold on much longer!

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:40.294
[yelps]

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:43.432
I swear, I won’t let you fall!

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:48.176
[screams]

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.478
Usoland!

00:04:49.512 --> 00:04:51.448
[USOPP screaming]

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.429
Thanks. You’re the man, Leo.

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:01.435
[LEO sighs]
That was a close one.

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.541
But what’s making
the ground shake?

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.045
You guys get
a lotta earthquakes?

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:22.211
[TOWNSMAN C]
How’s that possible?

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:23.847
This is scary!

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:39.546
He crumpled our town
as if it were paper.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.351
Next punch, there’ll be
nothing left of Dressrosa.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.353
Let’s leave!

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:44.856
Leave where, exactly?

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.029
You realize his fist can
reach us pretty much anywhere!

00:06:14.782 --> 00:06:17.955
[ZORO] All this damage
from a single blow.

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.130
Luffy! Law! Where are you?

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.488
[LUFFY]
Hey! Zoro!

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:39.131
Hi! We’re up here!

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:40.400
Up here!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.570
Luffy!

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:44.943
[LUFFY giggles]
It’s like I got hanged!

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.980
Stop joking and get us--

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.623
[LUFFY giggles]

00:06:51.657 --> 00:06:53.326
Get your ass off me.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:54.495
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.098
[LAW groans]

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:59.071
[LAW] What’s wrong with you?
Ya know I’m injured!

00:06:59.104 --> 00:06:59.973
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:01.644
[LAW]
Don’t act dumb!

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:03.847
[groans]

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:07.187
I’m starting to think
you’re trying to kill us all.

00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.893
Laughing at Pica’s voice,
especially to his face,

00:07:09.927 --> 00:07:11.563
is a death sentence.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.468
[yelps]

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:24.556
[LUFFY giggles]

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.327
[LUFFY]
He really flung us, didn’t he?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.398
Where are we now?

00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:30.668
[ZORO]
Like I’d know!

00:07:30.702 --> 00:07:33.540
Even further from the
palace, thanks to you.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.345
Damn it!

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.216
That stone bastard’s
somethin' else.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.387
Never thought we’d see
someone bigger than Oars,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.990
but here we are.

00:07:42.023 --> 00:07:45.196
How am I supposed to even
fight somethin' that size?

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:47.635
[CAVENDISH]
Straw Hat.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.609
[LUFFY]
Cabbage!

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.556
Pirate Hunter Zoro, I presume.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:01.896
And you. Trafalgar Law!

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.507
[CAVENDISH] You disgusting,
"“Worst Generation,"” scoundrel.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.211
Why do you steal
all the glory from me?

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:10.414
Stop yellin’!

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:12.217
Got a beef with my
crew mate or something?

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.621
I’m not in your crew!

00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:16.860
[LUFFY] Lemme guess, you still
got a grudge against us?

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:20.601
You’re wrong.

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.473
I shall no longer be
a threat to the Straw Hats.

00:08:23.507 --> 00:08:24.810
[ZORO, LUFFY]
Huh?

00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.913
Because your brave
crew mate, God Usopp,

00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:30.120
selflessly saved me from
a life of doom and gloom.

00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:31.523
Usopp did that?

00:08:31.557 --> 00:08:34.428
That’s right! I won’t
forget his valiant deed.

00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.798
He boldly risked everything

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.638
in order to spare
the lives of hundreds.

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:40.173
Or so it’s rumored.

00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:44.582
[laughs] Shucks, it’s nice to
hear you compliment my crew.

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:45.984
[CAVENDISH]
Oh, right!

00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:50.227
[CAVENDISH]
Trafalgar.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.896
I believe this is yours?

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.569
I happened upon it
outside of the Colosseum.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.607
I’m sure you’ve been
longing for it.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.044
Lend me your head a second.

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:01.282
[LAW] Get away from me!
I don’t trust you!

00:09:01.315 --> 00:09:04.421
[CAVENDISH] Hmph. Like I’d
waste any more time on you.

00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:06.259
I have a schedule to maintain.

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:08.964
Aren’t you going to
inquire why I’m so busy?

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:09.832
I’m good.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:11.101
Very well!

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.741
I shall indulge your inquisitive
appetite if you must know!

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.844
I have decided to repay
my debt to your crew

00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:19.418
by seizing the
head of Doflamingo!

00:09:19.452 --> 00:09:20.622
The hell?

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:22.993
Seek shelter in dirt
or whatever you do.

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:24.762
I shall handle these
matters as tribute.

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:27.267
Yeah! No thanks!
I’m gonna do it myself.

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.539
I already decided this
is how I’m gonna pay back

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.175
Rebecca for buying me lunch.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.814
You’re going head-to-head with
a warlord over some food?

00:09:33.848 --> 00:09:37.220
I won’t fall for it!
How dare you lie to my face!

00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:38.990
You’re just trying
to take out Doflamingo

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.195
for the fame and
riches that follow!

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:43.332
That sounds like you, actually.

00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:45.069
[CAVENDISH]
Just ponder it a moment!

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:48.109
He who brings down the dastardly
Doflamingo will make headlines,

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:50.848
ensuring the whole world
turns their head!

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.687
Imagine the crowds
clamoring to meet you!

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.697
[CAVENDISH] "“Mr. Superstar
Playboy Extraordinaire!"”

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.868
Just "“superstar"” will suffice.

00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.173
No need to be formal.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.776
What is it?

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:06.245
"“Excuse me, sir!

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:08.550
What’s your opinion regarding
piracy in recent years?"”

00:10:08.584 --> 00:10:10.020
"Oh? Are you still there?

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:13.493
I’m having trouble seeing!
Lord Cavendish, sir?"”

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:14.729
What’s the problem?

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:17.033
I’m standing here
in front of you!

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.639
"You’re shining so bright,
we can’t see you!

00:10:19.672 --> 00:10:21.743
Can you turn down your aura?"

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.079
Is it too intense for you?

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:25.985
I apologize, but I cannot
suppress my brilliance!

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:28.957
"“Wow! He really is a superstar!"

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.930
[LUFFY]
All right. Time to go.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.938
[CAVENDISH] Please feel free
to bask in my glory.

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.476
Take it in! Take it all in.

00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:45.824
[laughing]

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:53.305
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
What about here?

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:58.817
Keep searching
for Straw Hat’s body!

00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:09.205
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
After a punch like that,

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:13.012
he might’ve been
crushed to smithereens.

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:14.883
[PICA]
Perhaps he got away.

00:11:14.916 --> 00:11:17.320
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES chuckle]

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:24.034
[PICA]
Where are you hiding, Straw Hat?

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:32.150
[LUFFY laughs]
His voice is so high!

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:34.922
[PICA grumbling]

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:52.759
Find him!

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:56.165
I need to know if the
little maggot’s still alive!

00:11:56.199 --> 00:11:59.471
I’ll squash you flat
before you get to Doffy!

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:04.181
Luffy. Is that
squawking peacock guy

00:12:04.214 --> 00:12:05.752
a friend of yours?

00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.187
Oh, you mean Cabbage?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.489
Cabbage, huh?

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:10.527
His parents really
named him that?

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.063
[LUFFY]
He’s a real weirdo, huh?

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:15.336
I met a whole bunch of crazy
people back at the coliseum!

00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:16.506
[ZORO]
Huh.

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:18.677
There they are!

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.313
A Two-star and a Three-star!

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:21.315
[BOTH grunt]

00:12:21.349 --> 00:12:23.152
Don’t let '‘em get away!

[TOWNSPEOPLE yell]

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:26.827
[TOWNSMAN I]
Take this!

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.834
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Whip!

00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:34.107
Two-Sword Style! Rhino Cycle!

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:41.690
All right, boys!

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:44.127
We got some berries to collect!

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:48.670
[LUFFY, ZORO]
Crap. There’s more?

00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:50.173
Whatcha thinkin’, Luffy?

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:53.179
If we engage this mob,
we’ll be here all day.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:53.847
Wanna split?

00:12:53.881 --> 00:12:54.983
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.955
[CHIN JAO]
There you are, Straw Hat!

00:12:57.988 --> 00:12:59.859
Get out of my way!

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:02.564
[BOO]
Move! Move! Move!

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:03.867
[CHIN JAO]
You heard me! Go!

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.136
I know that guy.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:11.683
[CHIN JAO yells]
Grandson of Garp, wait for me!

00:13:11.716 --> 00:13:14.823
We ’ve been looking
for you, rubber boy!

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.728
Stay right there!

00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:20.567
[GROUP yelling]

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.070
Ugh! Thought so.

00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:23.272
[CHIN JAO]
We’re coming for you!

00:13:23.305 --> 00:13:25.644
We should go! Run!

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:28.683
[ZORO]
What's gotten into you?

00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:31.021
[CHIN JAO]
But we told him to wait!

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:35.630
We got more company?

00:13:35.664 --> 00:13:36.867
[SAI, BOO, CHIN JAO yelling]
Wait!

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.169
Just go away already!

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:42.076
Stop! Both of you! Head-Arms!

00:13:45.382 --> 00:13:47.421
[LUFFY gasps]

00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:50.594
[CHIN JAO] Is there something
wrong with your hearing,

00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:52.564
Grandson of Garp?

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:20.253
[CHIN JAO laughs]

00:14:20.286 --> 00:14:23.359
Just hear this old man
out for a moment.

00:14:23.392 --> 00:14:25.731
I wanted to let you know
I’ve forgiven the grudge

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.868
I held against your family.

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.471
What? You did?

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.175
We’re here for one thing.

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:34.916
And that’s to eliminate
Doflamingo’s immoral business.

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:37.220
We don’t care about the money.

00:14:37.254 --> 00:14:41.228
A puny bounty like that
is mere change for us.

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:43.600
I must thank you
and your friend.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:47.608
For the brave God Usopp
rescued me in my darkest hour.

00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:48.877
[LUFFY]
Usopp did that?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.146
Indeed he did.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.518
And that is why I have
decided to repay my debt

00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:55.090
to the Straw Hats by
obliterating Doflamingo

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:56.993
and his wicked monarchy.

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:58.964
Huh? You, too?

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:01.702
The only guy who’s
kickin’ his ass is me!

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:08.115
Speak up. What did you say?

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:10.286
What I said was "“don’t bother"”!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.455
I’m gonna do it!

00:15:11.488 --> 00:15:13.025
The nerve of you!

00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:15.897
Are you rejecting
my generous favor?

00:15:15.931 --> 00:15:18.870
[rumbling]

00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:21.676
Straw Hat. I was
searching for you.

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:23.880
[LUFFY]
Oh! The Giant guy!

00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:26.451
I say we bury the
hatchet between us.

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:29.291
I swear, as a proud
warrior of Elbaf,

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:32.230
I’ll slay Doflamingo
for God Usopp!

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.769
Huh? Again?
Get lost! I got this!

00:15:34.802 --> 00:15:36.906
[ELIZABELLO]
Just one moment!

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:38.109
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.581
We of the Prodence
Kingdom have long owed

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:42.951
King Riku an enormous debt.

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:46.960
I’ll bring down Doflamingo
with my own two fists.

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:49.297
Yes! His Majesty’s right!

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.636
We don’t want the bounty!
Not this time.

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:52.538
Huh?!

00:15:52.572 --> 00:15:53.573
[ABDULLAH]
Stand down!

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:56.045
We will be the ones
who kill that bastard!

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:58.349
We shall never forget
that beacon of light

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.588
who freed us from our torment!

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:02.825
Let us repay his valor!

00:16:02.858 --> 00:16:04.529
Wait!

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:08.202
I won’t let you
do this without me!

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.640
Destruction’s my specialty!

00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:14.849
You can leave
the execution to me.

00:16:14.883 --> 00:16:15.951
Back off!

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:18.389
I’ll be the one
to take his life!

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:19.357
Uh...

00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:21.294
You really attract
some oddballs, huh?

00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:23.767
[CAVENDISH]
You’d be a fool to forget me!

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.472
[yells]

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:28.577
Great. "“Big Mouth"”
found us again.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:35.223
[ALL growling]

00:16:35.256 --> 00:16:37.861
[ZORO] Hey! You all
serious about helping?

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:39.297
[CHIN JAO]
If you were wise,

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.671
you’d leave the task of
taking down Doflamingo to us!

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:44.609
I must do it for my pride!

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:47.347
I said I owe the King!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.053
All right, now this
is getting annoying.

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:52.992
Ugh. Hey, what if
we do it this way?

00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:54.127
[COMPETITORS]
Hm?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.331
Us two’ll handle
killing Doflamingo

00:16:56.364 --> 00:16:59.204
while you guys watch
our backs. Sound okay?

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:03.478
[ALL] Absolutely not!
I’m going to kill Doflamingo!

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.295
Forget it. There are way
too many egos involved.

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.399
[LUFFY]
Come on, guys.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:17.307
[sighs] All right, I’m making
the call, so listen up!

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.077
If anyone here’s
gonna kick his ass

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.147
like it needs to be kicked,
it’s gonna be me!

00:17:21.181 --> 00:17:22.918
What’d you say?

00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:25.891
You’re getting this favor
returned one way or another!

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:27.394
If you save someone’s life,

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:30.634
you better learn to accept their
kindness or else, ya moron!

00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:32.705
[BOO]
That’s right!

00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:34.140
I said leave it to me!

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:36.011
I’ll destroy him!

00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:38.349
My method will be the best way!

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:39.585
Duty!

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:40.820
Attention!

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.356
My pride!

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.059
The King!

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:45.096
[BOTH]
Our Savior!

00:17:45.129 --> 00:17:50.574
[COMPETITORS growling]

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:53.212
[yelps] A spear?

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:55.049
[TOWNSMAN U]
So that’s where they were!

00:17:55.082 --> 00:17:57.855
[TOWNSMAN V] Hey, ya think
we can get in on this?

00:17:57.889 --> 00:18:02.030
[laughs] Splitting up all those
bounties could go a long way.

00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:03.634
[laughs]

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:04.935
Wait a sec.

00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:06.940
Don’t they look kinda
familiar to you?

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:09.311
They were toys at
the dock, just like us!

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:11.983
That they were. As you say.

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:14.120
Those shameless cowards!
How dare they!

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:15.123
Let’s get that bounty!

00:18:15.156 --> 00:18:17.460
[TOWNSPEOPLE yell]

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:25.644
You ungrateful swine!
I’ll see you in hell!

00:18:27.447 --> 00:18:28.248
Let’s go.

00:18:28.282 --> 00:18:29.450
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

00:18:33.894 --> 00:18:36.264
[gasps] It’s Moocy!

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:39.605
A cow?

00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:41.274
Got an idea.

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:54.200
[yelps] There’s someone
approaching from the smoke!

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:58.509
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
It can’t be. A bull?

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:00.915
[bellows]

00:19:00.948 --> 00:19:02.952
Go, go!

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:06.158
[yelps] I have located
the Straw Hats!

00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:10.400
Look, Master Pica!
They came right to us!

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:11.903
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Don’t let them get away!

00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:15.309
They’re riding a bull!
I got eyes on three--

00:19:16.812 --> 00:19:23.527
Wait, I mean... four,
five... six? Seven?

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.095
[CHIN JAO]
Wait, Straw Hat!

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:28.336
[LUFFY]
Huh? I said get lost!

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:33.345
He brought an army?
Where did they come from?

00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:39.592
I said I’ve got this!
You all can stand down!

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:40.727
That’s enough!

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.899
I won’t hesitate to slice
you all into pieces

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:44.267
if you get in my way!

00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:46.404
Oh, don’t be so
full of yourself.

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:48.375
We’ll be the ones
to take his head!

00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:50.747
[ORLUMBUS]
Wrong! That’ll be my privilege!

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:51.916
[IDEO]
No, mine!

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:55.791
Luffy! What should we do
about all this dead weight?

00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:57.594
It was my idea first!

00:19:57.628 --> 00:20:00.400
Stop following us;
we don’t need you all!

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:05.610
[COMPETITORS chattering]

00:20:07.914 --> 00:20:09.719
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
How’d they get so many allies

00:20:09.752 --> 00:20:10.721
on such short notice?

00:20:10.754 --> 00:20:12.389
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
How should I know?

00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:14.762
Aren’t those some of the

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasping]

00:20:25.984 --> 00:20:27.486
That can’t be good.

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:32.764
He’s making a move!

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.148
Looks like he’s winding up!

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:42.584
I’m gonna knock him out!

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:45.991
Not if I get there first!
Back off already!

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:47.127
That’s absurd!

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.197
Leave this to my family.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:54.440

Here we go!

That fool’s no match for me!

00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:38.295
Hope it was worth it!

00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:41.068
You’ll be laughing
in your graves!

I got a lite one for you!

My king can throw a punch!

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:52.309
We can consider this
our practice round

00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:54.414
for when we finally
get to Doflamingo!

00:22:54.447 --> 00:22:55.683
Right? Huh?

00:22:55.717 --> 00:22:57.787

[NARRATOR]
Luffy heads to the Royal Palace

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:18.696
with a group of prideful
ruffians in tow.

00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:21.636
However, Pica easily blocks
all attempts to break through

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:23.105
and get back on course.

00:23:23.138 --> 00:23:24.440
As things start to look dire,

00:23:24.473 --> 00:23:26.980
after another of Pica’s
devastating blows,

Luffy stands up to him,

00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:31.154
revealing his stunning
ultimate technique!

00:23:31.187 --> 00:23:32.758
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i>!

00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:36.532
"Steady Progress!
Luffy’s Army vs. Pica!"

00:23:36.566 --> 00:23:39.538
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!
