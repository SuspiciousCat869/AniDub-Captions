00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.585
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.434
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats formed
a pirate alliance with Law

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.773
and defeated
the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:25.243
who had seized
control of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.343 --> 00:03:28.316
Now, at last,
the kingdom is at peace.

00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:31.055
[REBECCA]
Do you think he doesn't

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.292
want us to live together?

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.140
Maybe I'm just a nuisance!

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.411
Beats me! Not my call!

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:45.685
I just came to ask if you're
fine with him leaving!

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.020
So tell me!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.424
'Cause I gotta get out
of this kingdom, too!

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.569
Of course not!
It's not okay at all!

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:56.940
Then come with me.

00:03:58.711 --> 00:03:59.913
Let's go.

00:04:04.088 --> 00:04:06.292
[LUFFY] "The Bond Between
Father and Daughter!

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:08.530
Kyros and Rebecca!"

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:14.576
[TOWNSMAN A] I guess pirates
are rotten after all!

00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.747
[TOWNSMAN B] That's what
we get for trusting them!

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:19.452
[TOWNSMAN C] We thought you
were a hero, then you do this?

00:04:19.553 --> 00:04:21.857
Someone stop Lucy!

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:24.262
[TOWNSMAN E]
Give us back our princess!

00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:26.165
[TOWNSMAN F]
Stop running!

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.802
[TOWNSMAN G]
You can't get away!

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:35.785
[TOWNSMAN H]
He's going that way!

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:39.424
[LUFFY gasps]
They must really like you!

00:04:41.997 --> 00:04:43.934
[LUFFY gasps]

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:48.409
Our target is Straw Hat.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.321
You have a plan, right?

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:55.423
Take him out!

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:56.560
You ready?

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.461
[REBECCA]
Mm-hm!

00:04:57.562 --> 00:04:59.866
[MARINES yell]

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:02.437
Capture him!

00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:03.607
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:08.550
Aim carefully!

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.356
[REBECCA gasps]

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:13.359
Aw, damn it! No good!

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:15.430
It's Sea Prism Stone!

00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:21.442
[REBECCA]
Oh, no! Are you okay? Lucy!

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.886
Got it!

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.790
[MARINE A] Stop right there!
You're surrounded!

00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:34.368
[MARINE A] Step away from
the princess, slowly!

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.973
[REBECCA gasps]
What now?

00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:45.891
Hop on!

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:49.365
Attack!

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:51.703
[MARINES yell]

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:55.344
Get outta my way!
Gum-Gum Whip!

00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:57.682
[MARINES groan]

00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:00.554
[LUFFY]
Gatling!

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.036
[MARINE D]
Got you!

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:10.775

No! Lucy!

[LUFFY giggling]

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:24.001
[REBECCA screaming]

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.707
[TOWNSMAN I]
Whoa! What's going on?

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:28.009
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
Lucy?

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:29.378
[TOWNSMAN J]
That's my dinner!

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:30.547
[REBECCA]
We're sorry!

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.691
Listen.

00:06:36.893 --> 00:06:38.730
I'm gonna drop you off
at the hill.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.634
I'll lure them away.

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.438
Then you run for it, 'kay?

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:44.743
Seems like everybody's
on the lookout for you.

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:47.414
If you get caught, they'll take
you back to the palace.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.951
So be careful!

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:51.690
'Kay. But where do I go?

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.527
[LUFFY] Soldier should still be
at the little house

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:55.230
in the Flower Field.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.533
The Flower Field?

00:07:02.444 --> 00:07:05.083
Right. Got it.

00:07:05.183 --> 00:07:06.419
We better hurry, though.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.155
I don't know
how long he'll stay.

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:09.659
Thank you!

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.532
For everything you done, Lucy.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.740
[LUFFY giggles] No problem.
Glad it worked out.

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:42.726
[REBECCA crying]

00:07:42.826 --> 00:07:45.364
[SCARLET]
Her name is Rebecca.

00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:49.037
Kyros. She's your
child! Hold her!

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.043
[REBECCA giggles]

00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:55.483
[gasps] I shouldn't touch
such an innocent thing!

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.056
Not with these tainted hands.

00:07:58.156 --> 00:07:59.091
It's not right!

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:05.270
You're such a little
angel, aren't you?

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.673
I'll watch over you.

00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:09.177
I'll always be at your side!

00:08:11.048 --> 00:08:13.787
My little girl, you're so cute.

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:16.091

[KYROS]
Scarlet. I've fulfilled my duty.

00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:33.827
Forgive me for cooking up
a lie about our marriage.

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:40.575
[KYROS] I just want Rebecca
to live a happy life,

00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.645
safe from my past.

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:56.171
[REBECCA]
I gotta move.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.792
Hey, Mother! Mother!
Look at all the flowers I found!

[SCARLET]
There's so many of them!

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.532
I picked this one just for you!

It's beautiful!
Thank you, Rebecca!

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:15.276
And this is from
your mother to you! [laughs]

Would you like to have one, too?

We did good selling
all the flowers today!

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.820
[SCARLET]
Maybe people bought so many

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.957
'cause I had such
a cute little helper!

you are! Nice work!

Scarlet, Rebecca.
I need you to stay safe.

00:10:04.576 --> 00:10:05.844
Okay, Daddy.

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:29.157
I... I couldn't save her.

[KYROS]
I'm sorry! It's my fault.

00:10:35.403 --> 00:10:37.407
I failed to protect your mother!

I regret I couldn't save
your mother's life.

But I will devote mine to
protect yours whatever the cost!

00:10:52.136 --> 00:10:54.742
I'd rather have my mother!

[REBECCA]
I hate you.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:02.825
Because you couldn't
save her. I hate you!

Soldier!

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:11.108
[giggles] Is that better?

Yes. Your hand is very warm.

This is unfair. You can't go.

Not 'til I've seen you!

told you how I feel!

You know,

I wish we could both actually
live in the same house one day.

[REBECCA]
Soldier, wait!

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.795
[KYROS] You're going to
learn to defend yourself.

00:12:28.162 --> 00:12:31.670
Mother said I shouldn't
hurt others, no matter what!

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.578
But you must protect yourself
from those who would hurt you.

[KYROS]
Stand up, child! Don't give up!

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.072
[KYROS] Because you're
a member of the royal family,

you've had to endure
the hatred of this nation

it will be different.

You can live the life
you were meant to lead.

Look, I have a terrible history.

00:13:36.966 --> 00:13:41.241
I was a sorry excuse for a man,
always getting into fights.

00:13:41.642 --> 00:13:43.078
And I was a killer, too.

I can't deny what I've done.

That's the honest truth.

I've had to grant

[USOPP]
Luffy isn't here yet?

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.631
[CAVENDISH] I haven't seen
Law anywhere, either.

00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.670
[JEET] They're the ones who are
s'posed to be running this show!

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.139
Our group is pretty tough,

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:29.679
but what if the Navy
brings out the big guns?

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:31.047
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:33.085
Here he comes!

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.134
Fujitora!

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.840
And yep, we're dead!

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.246
Hurry up, Mister Luffy!

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:53.158
[LUFFY panting]

00:16:56.164 --> 00:16:57.969
[BASTILLE] All it takes
is an ounce of foresight

00:16:58.069 --> 00:17:00.306
to squash a fool like a bug.

00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:03.011
I've already sent reinforcements
to the Eastern Port,

00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.716
where Straw Hat's headed.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:07.555
They'll be pincered between
the warships at sea

00:17:07.655 --> 00:17:09.324
and Issho on land.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:15.436
Straw Hat and all the
rest of his criminal friends

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.708
will be felled in one swoop!

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:24.154
What now? Huh?

00:17:24.254 --> 00:17:26.157
Only one option!

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.510
[BARTOLOMEO]
Mister Zoro!

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.314
You and your friends
should stay back.

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:38.650
Leave this one to me!

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.087
[neighs]

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.494
Leave it to "us," you mean!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.270
[FARUL neighs]

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:52.878
[BASTILLE] Hey! What happened
to the reinforcements

00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:55.249
headed to the eastern port?

00:17:55.349 --> 00:17:57.521
[MARINE E]
They, uh, seem to have run into

00:17:57.621 --> 00:17:59.057
a bit of trouble along the way.

00:17:59.157 --> 00:18:01.127
And what does that mean?

00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:04.267
[MARINE E] Their bullets and
gunpowder have gone missing.

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.606
Unfortunately,
all of our other weapons,

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:10.780
like swords, axes, and knives
and such are missing as well.

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:17.159
[MARINE E] I can only assume
they were stolen by someone.

00:18:18.663 --> 00:18:21.101
[MARINE E]
And that's just the start.

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.804
The warships can't
sail from the port

00:18:22.904 --> 00:18:24.542
because they're all
stuck to each other.

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:26.613
Like someone
sewed them together!

00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:29.752
[MARINE F] You can't sew iron
with thread! This is insane!

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.390
[MARINE G] Grab something
and cut it! Hurry!

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.695
[MARINE H] We can't!
Our knives are missing!

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:37.099
[MARINE E] Also, the soldiers
who collapsed earlier

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.936
are still paralyzed.

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:42.010
How can you possibly
screw things up this much?

00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:44.247
[MARINE E]
We're sorry, sir!

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:45.416
[BASTILLE]
Do you know how many criminals

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:46.820
we're dealing with here?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.189
You can't let them get away!

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:49.993
Figure something out!

00:18:50.093 --> 00:18:51.562
[MARINE E]
W-We'll do our best!

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.231
[MANSHERRY]
I'm worried I might be taking

00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:54.735
too much from them today.

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:57.307
Mouji, you're sure
this is okay, right?

00:18:57.407 --> 00:18:59.477
I don't want them
to get paralyzed.

00:18:59.578 --> 00:19:01.716
They've all been so generous.

00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:03.085
Don't worry!

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:05.189
We got permission, of course!

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.126
From Kyros.

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:09.331
Please carry on, Princess!

00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:11.870
Okay, then! I'll keep it up!

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.641
We still have a whole ton of
heavy injuries to heal.

00:19:18.516 --> 00:19:19.886
I know you're in
the middle of this,

00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:21.255
but we need to go now.

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:24.460
Huh? I'll only be a second!

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:27.000
Okay, I'll wait!

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.936
[MARINE E] According to
the citizens we asked,

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:31.575
these strange occurrences
are the work of fairies.

00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:33.846
Seems to be something
they're used to.

00:19:33.946 --> 00:19:36.853
Are you stupid?
They're obviously lying to you!

00:19:36.953 --> 00:19:39.625
[MARINE E gasps]
I'll keep looking into it!

00:19:44.334 --> 00:19:46.237
[BARTOLOMEO]
B-Barrier!

00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:49.645
Will that hold against him?

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:51.983
[BARTOLOMEO] Wouldn't be
a barrier if it didn't!

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.553
We're not exactly weak!

00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:56.024
We can hold 'til Mister Luffy
and Law show up.

00:19:56.124 --> 00:19:57.761
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.409
Did the fight start already?

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.892
[SENGOKU] Would you like
some crackers, perhaps?

00:20:12.992 --> 00:20:15.129
[LAW]
No thanks. Just start talking.

00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:16.665
[OOK-OOK grunts]

00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:25.383
[SENGOKU]
A boy with White Lead Disease?

00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:27.988
So there was a survivor
from White Town?

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.492
[ROSINANTE] He resents
everything in this world.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.067
[ROSINANTE] Feels like I'm
watching my older brother

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:35.870
when he was a kid.

00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:37.541
[SENGOKU]
He has my sympathy,

00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:39.979
but there's no cure
for White Lead Disease.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:43.018
Don't get involved too much
or you'll give yourself away.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.222
I know. Don't worry.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.696
I won't forget
what I'm here to do.

00:20:49.397 --> 00:20:51.902
I'll stop my brother
at any cost.

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:55.743
[ROSINANTE] He won't lay
a finger on Dressrosa.

00:20:58.984 --> 00:21:01.354
[SENGOKU] We've lost
a lot of good Marines.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.327
But it was different
when I lost him.

00:21:04.427 --> 00:21:06.632
He was special to me.

00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:13.379
We met when he was a child.

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:16.084
I thought of him as my own son.

00:21:16.552 --> 00:21:17.921
He was as honest as they came,

00:21:18.021 --> 00:21:20.293
with an unshakeable
sense of justice.

00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:22.998
Naturally, he had
my absolute trust.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:29.912
[SENGOKU] Regardless, he did lie
to me once, in the very end.

00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:31.649
[ROSINANTE]
I heard you were looking to

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.452
make a trade for
the Op-Op Fruit.

00:21:33.553 --> 00:21:35.624
My brother caught
wind of it somehow.

00:21:35.724 --> 00:21:39.531
What? That's top secret info!

00:21:39.832 --> 00:21:43.172
[LAW] I see. So that's who
you're talking to, huh?

00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:45.510
[SENGOKU] So we'll plan an
ambush at Swallow Island.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.614
That'll be the
end of Doflamingo!

00:21:47.714 --> 00:21:50.219
It's a chance to catch
the whole Don Quixote Family

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:51.388
in one fell swoop!

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:53.860
Just make sure you stay away!

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.095
That was the plan.

00:21:58.636 --> 00:22:00.339
[MARINE J]
Landing unit here.

00:22:00.439 --> 00:22:03.647
Among the dead,
there's a Don Quixote Exec.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.851
His code name is Corazon.

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:07.052
[SENGOKU gasps]

00:22:10.827 --> 00:22:13.566
[MARINE J] I've sent a picture
of him. Could you confirm?

00:22:15.469 --> 00:22:19.711
[SENGOKU] Rosinante! What were
you doing on that island?

00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:24.789
[OOK-OOK grunts]

00:22:24.889 --> 00:22:28.629
He betrayed me.
That's how it felt, at least.

00:22:31.135 --> 00:22:34.708
[SENGOKU] But I know
he must have had a reason.

00:22:34.808 --> 00:22:38.348
There were four things that
were lost during that incident.

00:22:38.448 --> 00:22:40.152
The Barrels Pirate crew.

00:22:40.654 --> 00:22:42.857
The life of poor Rosinante.

00:22:44.127 --> 00:22:45.530
The Op-Op Fruit.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.935
And of course the young boy

00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:50.673
who was with the
Don Quixote Family then.

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:54.848
The one with
the White Lead Disease.

00:23:03.165 --> 00:23:05.670
Yeah. That was me.

00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:16.425
[NARRATOR] Admiral Fujitora
stands in the way

00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:17.861
of the Straw Hats
and their allies,

00:23:17.961 --> 00:23:19.631
who hope to escape Dressrosa.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.367
Firm in his determination,

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:23.940
Luffy challenges him head-on,
without a second thought.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.679
As the two men with
unshakeable conviction face off,

00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:29.885
their attacks roar like thunder
across the kingdom.

00:23:29.985 --> 00:23:31.622
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.722 --> 00:23:32.991
"Men's Pride!

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:35.897
Luffy vs. Fujitora,
Head-to-Head!"

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.903
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
