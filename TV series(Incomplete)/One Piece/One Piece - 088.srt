dare you laugh at me?!

176
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,020
Shut up!

177
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,030
[VILLAGER C]
I have to admit I was skeptical

178
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,965
when I heard about this
ropeway to the castle.

179
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,133
[VILLAGER D]
But here it is, just like

180
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,735
the young man told us...

181
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,303
[VILLAGER E]
This place looks familiar.

182
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,906
Didn't it used to
be Dr. Kureha's house?

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,913
[ZORO]
Great view from this thing, huh?

184
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,715
[USOPP] Yeah, but isn't it just
the teensiest bit overcrowded?

185
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,984
[VILLAGER F] We can't let Dalton
go alone when he's injured!

186
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,252
[VILLAGER G]
We'll fight alongside him!

187
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,387
[USOPP]
Okay, I get it!

188
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,256
But we're so overloaded;
it'll take forever to get there!

189
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,959
[DALTON pants]

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,129
You! You gotta peddle faster!

191
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,666
Dalton! Please! Just relax.

192
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,833
[DALTON]
Wapol...

193
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,169
[WAPOL] Who do you
think you are, Dalton?

194
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,907
"There's no medicine that
can cure fools," you say...

195
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,146
Did you call me,
the king, a fool?

196
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,148
What, do you think you're
some hero who speaks

197
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,651
for the lowly subjects of my
kingdom?! Don't make me laugh!

198
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,086
You're just a servant!

199
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,691
[WAPOL] A week in this cell
will give you plenty of time

200
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,925
to reflect on your mistake.

201
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,661
There's nothing like prison
to change a man's attitude.

202
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,862
And just in case
that doesn't work,

203
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,865
I'm gonna have that rebellious
streak beaten out of you!

204
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,801
[laughs]

205
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,002
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[DALTON groans]

206
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,204
[KUROMARIMO] You're an excellent
guard the citizen's trust.

207
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,339
Don't be a fool.

208
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,609
Apologize to the king and
show him respect, Dalton.

209
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,877
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[DALTON groans]

210
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,013
[CHESS] That dead doctor
Hiriluk was an idiot!

211
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,148
I can't believe you
fell for his nonsense!

212
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,184
Risking your status
and insulting the king?!

213
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,886
Have you lost
your mind, Dalton?!

214
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,055
[WAPOL] I'll grant you
a full pardon, Dalton.

215
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,890
All you have to do
is get on your knees

216
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,727
and say the following:

217
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,062
"I'm so sorry,
oh, great King Wapol.

218
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,199
You always know what's
right for this country!"

219
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:36,802
[laughs]

220
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,239
To hell with status!

221
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,742
To hell with the king!

222
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,743
[WAPOL]
Hm?

223
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,577
[tweets]

224
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,213
You dare mock me, too?!
Stupid bird!

225
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,015
I'm the king of Drum!

226
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,086
Yeah, so what?

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,655
[LUFFY]
It doesn't matter...

228
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,924
if you're a king or
even if you're a god...

229
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,427
It doesn't matter if
you're someone who's great

230
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,096
or someone who's not‐so‐great!

231
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
I'm still gonna
kick your lousy butt!

232
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,869
[WAPOL chuckles]
It does matter, Straw Hat!

233
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,871
Drum Kingdom is a member
of the World Government!

234
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,674
Don't you know
what that means?!

235
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,342
It means this
is a capital offense

236
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,844
because I'm the king!

237
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,180
Like I said,
big mouth, it doesn't matter!

238
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,216
King or no king,
I'm taking you down!

239
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,054
Oh, really? Well, not if I...

240
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,890
...take you down
first, Straw Hat!

241
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,359
[LUFFY chuckles]
That won't work!

242
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,460
[WAPOL]
But this will!

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,697
Munch Munch Shock!
Tongue Cannon!

244
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,965
Agh! His tongue
turned into a cannon!

245
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,267
[WAPOL]
Goodbye!

246
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,770
[screams]

247
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,799
[DALTON coughs]

248
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,503
[VIVI] Dalton! Someone
help me lift him!

249
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,005
Dalton, can you
hear me?! Dalton?!

250
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,640
Say something, please!

251
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,676
You can't die! You just can't!

252
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,611
Dalton! Please!

253
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,848
[DALTON groans]
I'm okay.

254
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,652
Please don't die...

255
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,956
[pants]

256
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,761
[DALTON]
I won't... I can't!

257
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,462
Not until I've put an end
to Wapol and what

258
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,997
he's done to this country!

259
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,833
[CHESS] "A government should
care about its country

260
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,603
and its people"?
You mean you weren't joking?

261
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,672
That's what you
really think, Dalton?

262
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,675
Please! A government
doesn't need to have a heart!

263
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:57,510
That's right!

264
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,845
It just needs to
control the people!

265
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,649
[gasps]

266
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,619
[WAPOL chuckles]

267
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,622
[DOCTOR A] What‐What are
you doing?! Unhand me!

268
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,359
Stop it! Let me go!
You can't do this!

269
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,628
I have patients who will
die if I don't treat them!

270
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,029
Throw him in the ocean!

271
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,732
If he resists, you have my
permission to shoot him!

272
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,468
[DOCTOR A] No! Think of
my patients at least!

273
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,503
They're the ones
who are going to suffer!

274
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,838
Don't do this!

275
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,910
[DALTON] To hell with
controlling the country!

276
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,979
[DALTON growls]

277
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,384
[HIRILUK] Good...
Then none of them are sick...

278
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,721
I'll show them what
happens to a country

279
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,390
that doesn't have a heart!

280
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,558
[gasps]

281
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,430
[ZORO]
Hm?

282
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,835
[VILLAGERS murmur]

283
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,736
[USOPP]
Dynamite?!

284
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,904
Everyone, listen...

285
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,074
Once we arrive, take cover,
because once I'm inside,

286
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,576
there'll be explosions.

287
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,950
Chopper, are you worried
about your friend?

288
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,619
[CHOPPER]
No, Doctorine, not at all!

289
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,621
Know why? 'Cause he's a pirate!

290
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,762
[WAPOL laughs] That idiot!
He let his guard down!

291
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,731
[laughs]

292
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,899
[LUFFY chuckles]

293
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,601
Whoa, look who's talking!

294
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,737
‐‐Huh?!
‐‐One... two...

295
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,405
Hey, what are you doing?!

296
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,941
Now stop!

297
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,743
Gum Gum...

298
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,946
[LUFFY]
...Blowgun!

00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,797
[CHOPPER]
Doctorine...

303
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,068
[KUREHA] It certainly seems
like it's finally over...

304
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,140
The long nightmare
has reached its end.

305
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,477
Its end...

306
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,915
[HIRILUK]
This country is sick right now.

307
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,151
[HIRILUK] The people and
the king both suffer from

308
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,587
a terrible sickness
of the heart.

309
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,825
And one day, I'll end up
saving this country

310
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,627
with medical science!

311
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,164
[VILLAGER D] Get out
of here, you crazy quack!

312
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,866
[VILLAGER E]
Don't ever come back!

313
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,968
[HIRILUK]
It's Wapol's guards! Run!

314
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,206

00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,853
I told ya not to
mess with that flag!

318
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,156
Now I'm finally
gonna kick your butt!

319
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,190

00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,025

Doctor...

322
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,372
[WAPOL]
Wait a minute!

323
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,207
I'll give you a medal and
a position in my cabinet!

324
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,542
[LUFFY]
Gum... Gum...

325
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,043
Look! There's
something going on,

326
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,712
on top of the castle!

327
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,652
[CHOPPER]
Doctor...

328
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,090
This...

329
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,591
This Kingdom...

330
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,694
Drum Kingdom, it's...

331
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,564
[yells]

00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,566

333
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,202
Fine! I'll make you vice‐king!

334
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,904
[CHOPPER]
It's... about to fall!

335
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,207
...Bazooka!

336
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,946

[LUFFY chuckles]

340
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,972
[KUREHA] So the Drum Kingdom
was ultimately defeated by

341
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,940
the Skull and Crossbones...

342
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,143
[cackles]

343
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,491
[USOPP]
Everybody, wait here!

344
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,894
I'll brave whatever dangers
lie ahead and let you know

345
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:42,961
when it's safe!

346
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,229

347
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,299
Agh! I'm going first!

00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,279
Hey?! What the
hell are you doing?!

349
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,480
Just watching your back!

350
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,182
Hiding behind it's more like it!

351
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,284
Why'd you even come
if you're so scared?!

352
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,151
[LUFFY grunts]

353
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,786
[USOPP]
Me? Scared? Don't be ridiculous!

354
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,321
I always laugh at
the face of danger!

355
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,156
[LUFFY yells]

356
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,357
Mommy!

357
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,093
Luffy?!

358
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,961
Zoro?! Usopp?!

359
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,196
[ALL yell]

362

[laughs]

363
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,142
Why'd you do that, ya moron?!

364
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,211
I didn't recognize you at first!

365
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,779
[laughs]

366
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,347
I thought you were
more of big mouth's guards

367
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,615
coming to fight!

368
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,184
Whoa, I'm really surprised you
guys came all the way up here!

369
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,054
Well, not you,
Zoro. But you, Usopp.

370
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,522
Aren't you normally
scared of doing stuff

371
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,190
like climbing mountains?

372
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,826
[laughs]
Yeah, right!

373
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,728
Whenever there's a
towering peak in front of me,

374
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,830
I get to climbing!
But let me tell you,

375
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,967
scaling that mountain
hand over hand was no picnic!

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,336
Actually, we took a
ropeway car up here, Luffy.

377
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,303
[USOPP groans]

378
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,339
[VIVI] Nami and Sanji‐‐
are they all right?

379
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,008
Yeah! Both of them
are just fine!

380
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,377
Oh! Thank goodness!

381
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,747
[chuckles]

382
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,016
Here's why! We're on the way...

383
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,819
Then! A giant condor flew out
of nowhere and attacked us!

384
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,988
So... What was that
you were doing on top

385
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,390
of the castle a few minutes ago?

386
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,092
[LUFFY] Beating the crap
out of the king.

387
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,561
[ZORO]
Oh... Okay...

388
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,030
[DALTON] You mean that person
I saw flying through the air,

389
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,398
it was actually Wapol?!

390
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,033
You‐You beat him?!

391
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,535
Yep! I sure did!

392
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,437
[USOPP] ...I threw a rope around
his neck and showed that bird...

393
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,907
And his two henchmen?
What happened to them?

394
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,942
Oh, well, the
reindeer beat them up.

395
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,444
What? Those two? A reindeer?

396
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,013
Once again, Captain Usopp
saved the day!

397
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:41,947
Oh, hey, Usopp...

398
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,082
I made a new friend
and you gotta meet 'em!

399
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,118
Get this‐‐he's a reindeer!

400
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,520
Reindeer?

401
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,389
A reindeer...

402
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,392
[DALTON]
Could it be...?

403
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,862
[DALTON gasps]

404
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,937
[DALTON gasps]
It is you...

405
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,307
[DALTON]
Stop!

406
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,075
I apologize for
those who had the nerve

407
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,944
to laugh at Hiriluk's death!

408

[CHOPPER gasps]

409
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,448

strength you'd only die in vain.

410

Don't waste your life...

411
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,289
Don't sacrifice it
for this country...

412
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,295
Blue Nose...
You never gave up...

413
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,432
...did you?
You still kept fighting...

414
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,968
believing in what this
country could become.

415
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,843
[DALTON]
And now, thanks to you...

00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,246

strange creature

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,361
behind that tree?!

421
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,996

He's not a yeti you idiot!

That thing's your friend?!

you to my friends!

running for a second?!
