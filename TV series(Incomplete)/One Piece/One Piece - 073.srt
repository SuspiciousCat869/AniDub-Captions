00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,361
[MR. 3]
Candle...

179
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,662
...Lock!

180
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,000
[yelps]

181
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,672
[chuckles] Mr. 5!

182
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,909
Bring the swordsman
and the other girl.

183
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,677
Time to begin.

184
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,917
[yells]

185
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:45,892
Giant... Candle... Set!

186
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,793
[gasps]

187
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,034
[growls]

188
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,872
[gasping]

189
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,919
[MR. 3 chuckles]

190
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,656
[MR. 3 laughs]

191
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,259
[gasps] So this is what
Mr. 3's capable of?!

192
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
What is that thing?

193
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:27,900
[gasps]

194
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,635
[MR. 5]
Here are the others.

195
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,905
[NAMI, ZORO grunt]

196
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,307
[NAMI groans]

197
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,142
[MR. 5]
It's just sad.

198
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,243
[gasps]

199
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,077
[ZORO grunts]

200
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,278
[MR. 5]
Idiots like these shoulda been

201
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,314
a lot easier for me to catch.

202
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,748
Shoulda caught 'em
the first time.

203
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,983
How embarrassin'.

204
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,084
No need to be ashamed.

205
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,753
You can't help the fact
that you're weak, after all.

206
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,955
[MR. 5]
What was that?

207
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,089
It's nothing.

208
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,358
Now, please just hurry
and get the candles set up.

209
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,359
[NAMI]
Candles?

210
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,794
[NAMI gasps]

211
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,929
[NAMI]
What is that thing?!

212
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,432
Nothing good.
I'm sorry, you guys!

213
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,967
But... Vivi...

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
What happened? I thought
you were with Luffy!

215
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,204
I was... but now...

216
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,373
[MR. 5] If you're wonderin'
about the Straw Hat,

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,443
I saw to that
little runt myself.

218
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,212
He didn't put up
much of a fight either.

219
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,880
Yeah, right.

220
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,301
[MR. THREE chuckles]

221
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:41,340
[MR. THREE laughs]

222
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,045
Welcome, one and all,

223
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,015
to my famous candle service set.

224
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,440
I guess this is
what it feels like

225
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,776
to be a candle stuck
on a birthday cake.

226
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,510
Guys...

227
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,412
What's that spinning up there?

228
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,250
I can't move. Great.

229
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,451
It's not surprising to me that

230
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,620
they don't want
us moving around.

231
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,755
That's what "captured" means.

232
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,261
Damn... That stuff's hard.

233
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,196
And I can't put much
strength behind my swing

234
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,131
from this angle.

235
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,132
Something's falling.

236
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:45,805
[laughs] I do hope you
enjoy my candle service.

237
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,406
You may have noticed
the wax flakes

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,607
that are falling from above.

239
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,311
You'll eventually be covered
and turned into wax figures.

240
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,581
You'll become perfectly lifelike
statues for my collection.

241
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,784
Something that even I
couldn't achieve on my own.

242
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,720
I will literally
capture your spirits

243
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,590
and encase them
forever in wax shells.

244
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,792
It will be a true masterpiece.

245
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,462
You will die for my art.

246
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,230
I don't think so, you freak!

247
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,265
I have no interest in
dying for whatever it is

248
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,734
you consider art!

249
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,634
Hey, giant!

250
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,836
Why are you laying
there doing nothing

251
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,639
when you could be beating the
crap out of this candle guy?

252
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,676
Now he is gonna make
one huge statue.

253
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,811
[MR. 3] Heh! You can
try to convince him,

254
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,747
but your efforts
will be useless.

255
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,515
He's a little blue
at the moment.

256
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,351
You see, he just realized how
unfairly he won his last fight,

257
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,520
and he's lost the
heart to celebrate.

258
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,188
He killed his dear friend Dorry,

259
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,491
with whom he had
fought for 100 years.

260
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,293
Dorry was injured.
But he didn't notice.

261
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,361
Just imagine how much pain

262
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,865
Dorry must have been in.
He didn't stand a chance.

263
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,700
You did shed
a few tears, though.

264
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,668
Perhaps you were crying
for your friend?

265
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,536
[laughs]

266
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,372
Now it's no use.
There's no undoing it.

267
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,674
He's dead! And it's
all your fault!

268
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:01,714
[MR. THREE laughs]

269
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,853
[BROGGY]
I should have seen it.

270
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,190
I knew something
strange was going on.

271
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,364
[BROGGY] From the moment
we first began to fight,

272
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,899
I knew Dorry was
hiding something,

273
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,802
but I couldn't tell what it was.

274
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,870
You say that you knew it?

275
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,138
You're lying!

276
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,375
If you knew something was wrong,
why didn't you stop the fight?

277
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,577
Why didn't you give him
a chance to rest?

278
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,846
I didn't see one shred of pity
in the way you ruthlessly

279
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,247
cut him down.

280
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
[MR. 3 laughs]

281
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,584
[BROGGY growls]

282
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,886
[BROGGY] You know nothing
about honorable duels!

283
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,924
Someone like you could
never understand my tears.

284
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,693
What do you know
about the way of Elbaf?

285
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,696
You think that I would shame
a warrior who hid the fact

286
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,366
that he was weakened so that
he could continue to fight?

287
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,239
Only a truly great warrior
would go to such lengths,

288
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,943
and such a man isn't
interested in pity!

289
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,743
Huh?

290
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,411
[BROGGY]
Now...

291
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,247
I know what really happened.

292
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,782
And I must do
something about it.

293
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,918
I'm going to finish this
with my own two hands.

294
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,388
[BROGGY growls]

295
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,623
[MR. 3 gasps]

296
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,729
[BROGGY] That's the least
I can do for Dorry.

297
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,699
He was a great warrior
and my dear friend!

298
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,635
[BROGGY yells]

299
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,637
[gasps] Broggy!

300
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:37,643
[groaning]

301
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,986
[NAMI, VIVI]
Broggy!

302
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,655
His chatterin' was
gettin' on my nerves.

303
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,663
[LUFFY]
U... Usopp... Usopp...

304
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,471
They have to... pay for this.

305
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,475
[weakly] Oh, yeah.
Those jerks have to pay.

306
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,820
[LUFFY]
You can't... take this either?

307
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,623
[squaks]

308
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,829
Heh. All right.
Then it's settled.

309
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,299
Let's go beat them senseless.

310
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,099
[NAMI]
Broggy!

311
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,702
[MISS VALENTINE laughs]
Big fool!

312
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,603
[MR. 5 chuckles]

313
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,605
[MR. 3]
It seems that I miscalculated.

314
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,008
I forgot how freakishly strong
these dumb giants can be.

315
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,543
[BROGGY growls]

316
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,878
It looks like you're
going to require

317
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,314
more complete restraints.

318
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,318
Wax‐wax... Handcuffs!

319
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,955
[MR. 3]
Still going!

320
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,858
[NAMI, VIVI gasp]

321
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,797
And now for the finishing touch.

322
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,632
Take this!

323
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,704
[screams]

324
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,740
[MR. 3 cackles]

325
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,576
It'll be tough for you
to move now, won't it?

326
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,580
[laughs]

327
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,021
You really are despicable.

328
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,691
Now! Let's get these
candles going faster!

329
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,494
It's time to turn these
people into beautiful,

330
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,529
artistic wax statues!

331
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,666
[MR. 3 laughs]

332
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,603
[NAMI coughs]
My chest is starting to hurt.

333
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,605
The wax is starting
to get into our lungs.

334
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,875
At this rate, he's gonna turn us
into wax from the inside out!

335
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,244
That's it.

336
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,446
Make it look like you're
in as much pain as possible!

337
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,614
That's perfect.

338
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,583
Expressions of agony
are what I seek

339
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,784
to achieve in my art!

340
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,454
The finished product
will be simply splendid!

341
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,757
You must die filled with terror!

342
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,792
[NAMI] This is what you
call art, you creepy,

343
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,129
weird‐haired freak?!
You guys are gonna regret this!

344
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,698
You're gonna pay for what
you did to Broggy and Dorry

345
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,533
and for what you're
trying to do to us!

346
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,935
[MR. 3] Yell and scream
all you want to, little girl.

347
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,937
No one can help you now.

348
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,379
[BROGGY]
A century...

349
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,723
[BROGGY] For 100 years,
Dorry and I dueled

350
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,826
day in and day out,
fighting endlessly.

351
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,661
We battled for our pride,

352
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,164
as is the way of the
warriors of Elbaf.

353
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,100
We fought with honor
and with strength.

354
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,602
And still, we are
subjected to this.

355
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,005
Why has this happened to us?!

356
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,942
[BROGGY] Must we be
forced to meet our end

357
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:00,012
in such a way? Must we?

358
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,014
It isn't fair for a
warrior to die such

359
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,485
a dishonorable death!
Why can I not die in battle?!

00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,027
And just the right
amount of anger.

00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,028

This isn't good.

My hands won't move.
Can't we do something?

369
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,037
I don't wanna die like this!

beginning to turn stiff.

I'm not messing around at all.

It's the only way to get us
out of this situation.

Are you insane? No way!

Even if you get down from here,
you won't get far without legs!

393
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,079
[ZORO] There's no way to
know for sure until we try.

394
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,015
So are you saying you'd
rather just sit here and die?

395
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,152
Why should we make it easy
for those guys to kill us?

396
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,720
Dying quietly without a struggle

397
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,555
doesn't make you
any less dead.

398
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,923
Right?

399
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,192
The girl was right.
This guy's insane.

00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,360
He's bluffing.

401
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,595
There's no way he would do
something as crazy as that.

402
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
He's just trying to act tough
so his friends will feel better.

is he? And why...
