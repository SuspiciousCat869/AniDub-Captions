1
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,331
[NARRATOR] Spring has finally
arrived in Grand Jipang.

2
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,532
It's said that in spring,

3
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,568
one can sleep
right through sunrise.

4
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,370
If that was so, you'd
think the townspeople

5
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,440
must be taking it easy, but
that's not really the case.

6
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,042
Tomorrow's the big day!

7
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,177
And this is just the
perfect weather for it!

8
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,811
Yeah.

9
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,246
This is gonna be great!

10
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,047
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
On my way here,

11
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,914
I stopped by
Pinwheel and put in

12
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,250
my family's order
for bento lunches!

13
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,419
Sounds like it'll
be a nice afternoon!

14
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,254
[NARRATOR] And this is
what the townspeople

15
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,123
are so excited about.

16
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,558
Each year, a festival is
held under the branches

17
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,794
of this gigantic
millennium sakura tree.

18
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,597
Its gorgeous blossoms are
the pride of Grand Jipang,

19
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,199
and everyone in town
comes to see them.

20
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,470
I'm sure they'll be happy
to share some food with me.

21
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,504
[NARRATOR] With a
celebration like that,

22
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,441
even a hungry monk
finds it hard to stay away.

23
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,276
[ZORO]
Shut your mouth.

24
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,245
[NARRATOR]
Anyway,

25
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,479
even during the festival,

26
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:36,216
there are those who have more
pressing matters to tend to.

27
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,253
[LUFFY] "Influenza"?
What the heck is that?

28
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,121
More commonly
known as "the flu",

29
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,223
tt's a type of
infectious disease.

30
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,224
[CHOPPER]
It's contagious,

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,659
so he shouldn't leave the house.

32
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,695
And he needs lots of rest.

33
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,729
--What?
--What?

34
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:49,963
But he can't!

35
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,666
We're all supposed to go to
the sakura festival tomorrow!

36
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,600
That's impossible!

37
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,669
If he does that,
his condition will worsen.

38
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,171
There's a chance
he could even die!

39
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,372
How awful.

40
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,407
Carrot was really looking
forward to it this year, too.

41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,476
Sensei, can't you
do anything for him?

42
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,310
You're a doctor!

43
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,177
Be that as it may,

44
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,213
even a doctor has
things they can do

45
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,048
and things they can't.

46
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,251
[CARROT]
I'm sorry, guys.

47
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,152
[coughing]

48
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,388
It's my fault that
I got sick, okay?

49
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,790
No reason to blame
Blue Nose sensei.

50
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,061
Look, don't worry about me.

51
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,796
There's always next year, right?

52
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,198
Just go to the
festival without me.

53
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,073
[USOPP] Everybody
keeps going on and on

54
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,110
about the sakura festival.
It's so annoying!

55
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,678
Come on!
Don't talk like that!

56
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,679
Thanks to that festival,

57
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,814
we have a ton of bento
lunch orders coming in.

58
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,816
That sakura tree is
a blessing for us!

59
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,551
She's right, you know.

60
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,687
Speak for yourself--
it's a curse for me!

61
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,355
While everyone else
is out having fun,

62
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,690
I'm stuck patrolling the city!

63
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,325
It's nothing but a
nuisance, I tell you!

64
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,459
That's ridiculous!

65
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,794
The whole town will be empty.

66
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,362
What on earth are
you patrolling for?

67
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,164
You should just take it easy!

68
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,531
Isn't that right?

69
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,672
[LUFFY] This sucks!
Isn't there something we can do?

70
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,574
[CHOPPER]
Not really.

71
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,108
I wish there was
some way I could show him

72
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,277
the millennium
sakura tree blooming.

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,345
And I wish
there was some way

74
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,714
I could heal him
so he could just go.

75
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,417
Hey! What's up
with those two?

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,819
[USOPP] Beats me, but
they've been like this all day.

77
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,387
No matter
how I look at it,

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,523
I can't think of one
single thing I can do.

79
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,191
[CHOPPER]
Me neither.

80
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,194
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

81
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,296
[LUFFY] See ya later,
Blue Nose sensei.

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,131
[CHOPPER]
Yeah. See ya.

83
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,602
What's the deal?

84
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,139
It's not like them at all to
act like that at festival time.

85
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,441
Boss didn't even
finish his food!

86
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,645
[NARRATOR]
And, after a restful evening,

87
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,647
the day of the sakura blossom
blooming festival

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,048
finally arrived!

89
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,424
I made you medicine, Carrot.

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,362
[USOPP]
What the hell is this?

91
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,367
The sakura tree!

92
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,369
It vanished without a trace!

93
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,104
It's a mystery, I tell you.

94
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,440
How and why would anyone
steal something that massive?

95
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,441
Good point!

96
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,644
Pulling off a stunt like
this is less about money

97
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,646
and more about power.

98
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:23,083
Knowing that, my detective
skills are telling me...

99
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,718
...the culprit
must be our lord!

100
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,720
Not Cobra-sama!

101
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,089
Yeah.

102
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:30,591
He wanted that
tree all for himself,

103
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,493
so he and some of
his men came down here

104
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,195
in the middle of the night,
carefully dug it up, and--

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,531
Idiot! Why the hell would our
lord do something like that?

106
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,301
Serves me right.

107
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,570
Don't know why I asked
you in the first place.

108
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,604
Where's Straw Hat?

109
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,439
We've got an emergency here!

110
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,074
Well, I went looking for him,

111
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,609
but couldn't find him anywhere!

112
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,211
But I'm sure he'll
be here real soon.

113
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,181
[LUFFY] I wish
there was some way

114
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,183
I could show him the millennium
sakura tree blooming.

115
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,587
[USOPP]
The millennium sakura tree.

116
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,022
No, he couldn't have!

117
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,395
Hey! Have you guys
seen the Boss around?

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,332
Whoa. What the--?

119
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,766
What's going on here?

120
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,237
[SANJI] Well, since the
sakura tree's gone missing,

121
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,272
everybody cancelled
their bento lunch order.

122
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,642
[NAMI] Thanks to
that no-good tree thief,

123
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,611
we're going to take
a huge loss on this!

124
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,613
Pinwheel is done for!

125
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,382
Whoa. Sorry to hear that.

126
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:31,218
Hey! Hey! Come here!

127
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,390
What is it?

128
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,292
Well, see...

129
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,361
[whispering]

130
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,196
So Boss is the
sakura tree thief?

131
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,130
Shh!

132
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,799
I don't have any proof--
it's just a hunch.

133
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,102
Do you remember what
he said yesterday?

134
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,536
Yeah, it was
something about wanting

135
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,405
to show the sakura
tree to someone.

136
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,240
Right! Exactly!

137
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,643
And I haven't seen
him all morning.

138
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:58,245
When you put everything
together, it all adds up.

139
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,648
[NAMI] Who did you say
the tree thief was?

140
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,385
That little Straw Hat bastard!

141
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,820
Wait! Like I was saying,
it's just a hunch, so--

142
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,189
[NAMI] Enough! It doesn't
matter who did it!

143
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,824
Just find them and
arrest them already!

144
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,526
This criminal must
be brought to justice

145
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,161
so we can resume the festival

146
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,330
and sell off every last
bento lunch in Pinwheel!

147
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,498
Now get going!

148
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,632
[USOPP and SANJI]
Yes ma'am!

149
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,250
[USOPP]
So, you find him?

150
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,317
[SANJI]
Nope. No luck.

151
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,320
[USOPP] Did you check
Blue Nose sensei's place?

152
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,287
[SANJI]
Not yet.

153
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,189
But somebody told me
they saw the good doctor

154
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,824
headed over to
Carrot's house earlier,

155
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,594
so I'm on my way there
now to check it out.

156
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,661
At Carrot's house, huh?

157
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,628
[SANJI] Yeah.

158
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,197
Not only that, they
said he was muttering

159
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,566
about the sakura
blossoms as he walked by.

160
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,800

00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,412
Are you trying to say that
despite having that branch,

177
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:41,315
you don't know anything
about the missing sakura tree?

178
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,450
Hold on a sec!
Did you say the tree's missing?

179
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,519
[USOPP] Oh, come on!
Fess up, will you?

180
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:48,055
We can still try to
sort this out. Trust me!

181
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,356
[LUFFY] I don't know
what you're talking about.

182
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,357
I found this on the ground

183
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,192
and thought it'd be nice
to show it to Carrot!

184
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,627
I'm sick and tired of your lies!

185
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,828
Now tell me what
you did with it!

186
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,263
[RIKA] It was me!
I put it by the door

187
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,197
where he could find it!

188
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,331
Ha, I knew it!

189
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:02,235
You found it on the ground
by the door where--Orika?

190
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,506
I'm so sorry!

191
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,663
[RIKA] After hearing
what Blue Nose sensei said,

192
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,131
we really wanted
to find some way

193
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,400
to show Carrot
the sakura blooms.

194
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,302
So Pepper, Onion,
and I went to the tree

195
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,370
in the middle of the night

196
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,405
to see what we
could come up with.

197
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,142
[RIKA]
Are you guys okay?

198
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,744
[PEPPER] We're fine!
Really! No need to worry!

199
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,381
[PEPPER] Look!
That one's perfect!

200
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,750
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,653
Please allow us this one
branch to show our friend.

202
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,128
Somebody's coming!

203
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,365
Come on, you guys!
We gotta get out of here!

204
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,203
We can't!
There's no time!

205
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,771
Take that branch
and go on without us!

206
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,406
I won't leave without you!

207
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,540
We'll be fine!

208
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,675
As soon as they're gone,
we'll climb down and come home.

209
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,778
Just leave the branch
in front of Carrot's doorway.

210
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,380
Don't let anyone see you!

211
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,614
Uh, okay.

212
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,048
[PEPPER]
Hurry!

213
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,295
[SANJI]
I see.

214
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,164
So after that, you
brought the branch here

215
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,233
and left it where
Carrot could find it?

216
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,501
Yeah. Sorry.

217
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,769
[USOPP]
Hold on. Wait a sec.

218
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,072
Does that mean that the culprits
that stole the sakura tree are--

219
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,674
No way it was
Pepper and Onion,

220
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,409
and it wasn't me, either.

221
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,777
So the true
thieves are the ones

222
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,180
that arrived after
Orika ran away.

223
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,715
Oh, no! This is terrible, Boss!

224
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:55,682
--[LUFFY] Hm?
--[SANJI] Before we came here,

225
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,685
I stopped by to check in
on Pepper and Onion,

226
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,353
and neither of them were home!

227
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,155
There's only one
place they could be.

228
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,556
Wait! Are you saying--

229
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,433
[CARROT]
Boss!

230
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,369
[USOPP]
Don't worry!

231
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,170
We'll take it from here!

232
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,539
Orika, keep an eye
on Carrot, okay?

233
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,573
[RIKA]
Right!

234
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,210
[LUFFY]
Oh! Blue Nose sensei!

235
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,578
Take good care of Carrot!

236
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,479
What's going on?

237
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,613
[USOPP]
Thank goodness!

238
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,749
He's still sick, so check
in on him, please! See ya!

239
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:29,650
Sure! Bye!

240
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,452
Hey, Boss!
Couldn't all the information

241
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,387
in that letter that was
on the arrow be fake?

242
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,556
No way! It's the truth,
I just know it!

243
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,124
Hurry! We gotta
get to the harbor!

244
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,798
What's gonna happen to us now?

245
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,466
I don't know!

246
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,538
[BUGGY] So. What do you
think, my foreign brother?

247
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,706
I bet you've never seen such

248
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,209
an amazing sakura
tree in all your life!

249
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,478
A world traveler and
gatherer of rare items

250
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,214
such as yourself should be eager
to add it to his collection.

251
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,549
Wouldn't you agree,
Silver Fox Foxy?

252
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,685
[FOXY laughs]

253
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,154
[FOXY]
Indeed, brother Buggy.

254
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:10,791
This beautiful specimen
will be a magnificent addition.

255
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,360
I'm sure my dear Porche will
be ever so pleased with it,

256
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,427
as well.

257
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,132
Then I suppose we should
finalize this transaction.

258
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,301
[laughing maniacally]

259
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:21,335
With the money from this,

260
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,536
all of my magnificent plans

261
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,672
will finally be able
to come to fruition!

262
00:13:24,705 --> 00:13:27,675
Now. How about you give me
the 10 million Ryo-Berries

263
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,209
you promised me.

264
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,478
[FOXY]
Oh, I don't have any money.

265
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,449
You what?!

266
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,519
D-d-d-don't h-h-have
a-a-a-any m-m-money?!

267
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,255
What the hell are
you trying to pull?

268
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,123
Do you have the
slightest idea how much

269
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,093
of a pain in the ass it
was to get this thing here?

270
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,529
You were lying to me from
the beginning, weren't you?

271
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:51,432
I bet you're flat broke,
you bastard!

272
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,201
[FOXY] No, no.
I've got plenty of money.

273
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,136
I'm what you
would call "loaded".

274
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,272
And if I sell this tree
to another country,

275
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,274
I'll be even more so.

276
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,142
See how that works?

277
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,644
What I meant to say
is I don't have

278
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,313
any money for an
overdressed clown like you.

279
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,282
[BUGGY] How dare you
mock me so flashily!

280
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,117
This was a lot of
trouble, damn it!

281
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,519
Prepare a Buggy Ball, men!
We're gonna blow him away!

282
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,055
[BUGGY PIRATES]
We're way ahead of you, Boss!

283
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,590
You're gonna regret that.

284
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,326
[laughing]

285
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,467
Hey! That's--

286
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,670
You're the one
that sent this, right?

287
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,205
Thanks a lot!
Where's the sakura tree?

288
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,610
[ROBIN] It's on the far side
of that island over there.

289
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,413
It appears to be onboard a ship.

290
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,382
It's such a
beautiful specimen.

291
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,583
They're probably
planning to sell it

292
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,286
to some other country,
far away from here.

293
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,254
[ROBIN] Fortunately,
there's a ferry available.

294
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,223
You should hurry
before it's too late.

295
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,791
That island's being developed
by the government

296
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,126
so people can live on it,

297
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,261
but it's still
deserted right now.

298
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,196
It'd be a pretty
inconspicuous place to do

299
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,699
some dirty business without
being seen by anyone.

300
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,734
We should get over
there and check it out.

301
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,571
Thanks again for the--
Where'd she go?

302
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,306
[USOPP]
Whoa! She's gone!

303
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,775
At least she helped us out
before she disappeared.

304
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:10,311
Whatever. Let's get going!

305
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,045
Hey! Wait up, Boss!

306
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,748
She's so beautiful.

307
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:30,597
You bastard!

308
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,068
[FOXY laughing]

309
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,402
[FOXY] Behold the
magnificent power

310
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,037
of the Slow-Slow fruit!

311
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,372
I bet you fools never
thought you'd meet

312
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,076
your demise in such a
fabulous way, did you?

313
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,444
But you won't die yet.

314
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,613
The effects'll last
another thirty seconds.

315
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,114
Still, no sense in wasting

316
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,749
that cannonball of
yours, now, is there?

317
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,784
Why don't we find you a
better seat for the show?

318
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,652
Yeah. Right over here.

319
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,325
[BUGGY]
How dare y--

320
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,427
[distant crash]

321
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,765
Whoa! What's that?

322
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,300
Looks like something blew up!

323
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,502
I sure hope Onion and
Pepper are okay over there.

324
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,137
[LUFFY] Thanks, Pops!

325
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,240
I think we can go the
rest of the way on our own!

326
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,044
[PAGAYA]
Oh? All right, then.

327
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,146
I'm sorry for not taking
you all the way across.

328
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,114
Very sorry, indeed.

329
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,552
[FOXY laughing]

330
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,820
So tell me.

331
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,290
How does it feel to get blown up
by your own men's attack, eh?

332
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,791
[BUGGY]
It hurts like hell!

333
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,726
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this!

334
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,561
Get him, boys!

335
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:41,201
Fools! Slow-Slow Beam!

336
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,406
No! Boss Buggy!

337
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,079
[ALL screaming]

338
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,755
Whew!
Wasn't expecting that!

339
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,324
[SANJI]
Hey, Usopp, you okay?

340
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,224
It's Boss!

341
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,327
What the hell? Hey!

342
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,596
What's your problem, damn it?

343
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:09,830
[LUFFY]
The sakura tree!

344
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,732
That must make
you the tree thief!

345
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,799
How dare you!

346
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,069
You come in from out of
nowhere, destroy my ship,

347
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:15,936
and then have the nerve

348
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,105
to throw around
accusations like that?

349
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:18,906
Who are you?

350
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,608
I'm Straw Hat Luffy,
a policeman.

351
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,743
And I'm tired of your
sakura-stealing mouth!

352
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,379
You're under arrest, split-head!

353
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,647
[FOXY]
Split-head?

354
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,282
[SANJI]
Wow, he's really depressed.

355
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,683
This guy's got issues.

356
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,352
More importantly, Boss,

357
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,387
I see a familiar face
up there on deck.

358
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,191
[LUFFY] Buggy!
You just never learn!

359
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,495
[LUFFY] Gimme back
that sakura tree!

360
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,702
[LUFFY]
What the heck?

361
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,606
Whoa, that's weird.
What's he doing?

362
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,807
Not much of anything!

363
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,644
He's been slowed down by the
power of my Slow-Slow Beam!

364
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,279
You need to be careful, Boss!

365
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,748
This guy's got
some strange powers!

366
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,549
Pepper! Onion!

367
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,589
What's with him?

368
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,724
He just now felt that punch?

369
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,761
[FOXY] You're about
to suffer the same fate!

370
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,763
[FOXY] They call me
Silver Fox Foxy.

371
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:18,732
I'm a man who obtains
everything he desires.

372
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,670
And no lowly, nosy, policeman
is going to stand in my way!

373
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,405
Slow-Slow Beam!

374
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,076
--Boss, no!
--Boss, no!

375
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,145
[laughing]

376
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,147
Listen kiddo, I don't care
if you're the law around here

377
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,014
or not!

378
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,316
You're about a
thousand years too early

379
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,284
to go up against
the likes of me!

380
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,251
[FOXY] And it seems
like you've brought

381
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,287
some annoying little
friends with you, too.

382
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,224
Oh well, nothing I can't
fix with a few cannonballs.

383
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,626
Not if I can help it!

384
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:46,794
Poor Boss!

385
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:49,563
[ZORO] Hey!
Keep it down, will ya?

386
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,765
What a pain. I'm trying
to get some sleep here!

387
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,833
[ONION and PEPPER]
It's the monk!

388
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:53,834
[ZORO]
Is it morning already?

389
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,171
Wait! Oh, yeah! Today's
the big sakura festival!

390
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,505
Hey! Where the hell am I?

391
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,540
What's going on?

392
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:00,808
Why're you up there, anyway?

393
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,576
Someone stole the
sakura tree last night

394
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,443
and us along with it!

395
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,279
There's not gonna
be a festival now!

396
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh yeah?

397
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,115
Who did that? Tell me!

398
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,688
Give back the tree, you bastard!

399
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,156
[FOXY]
No way!

400
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,793
He stopped him in mid-air?

401
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,027
[USOPP]
Dammit!

402
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,299
Special Attack...
Exploding Star!

403
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,333
Nope!

404
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,136
What is this?

405
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,105
[ZORO]
So it was you.

406
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,573
How am I supposed
to get my free food

407
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,142
if there's no festival?

408
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,111
One fool after another!

409
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:39,179
Well, I've had enough!

410
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,317
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing!

411
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,652
Now Gum-Gum--

412
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,688
Huh? 30 seconds already?

413
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,457
Now you're gonna pay.
You're dead!

414
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,193
[FOXY]
Double Slow-Slow Beam!

415
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,666
Chop-Chop Festival! Haha!

416
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,309
[FOXY] He deflected
it with his sword?

417
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:24,358
[LUFFY] You tried to
steal away everyone's fun!

418
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,627
I'm never gonna
forgive you for this!

419
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,762
I'm the one who's
never gonna forgive you!

420
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,531
Don't think this is over!

421
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,799
You're right. It's not.

422
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,467
It'll be back in just a second.

423
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,236
Oh? What will?

424
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,770
[LUFFY]
My right hand.

425
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,808
[LUFFY]
Billy Club!

426
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:44,578
[FOXY screaming]

427
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,551
You really sent
him flying, huh?

428
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,520
By the way.
What should we do about him?

429
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,558
[LUFFY] You've gotta be the
dumbest guy in the world.

430
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,260
Just give the crazy
plans a rest already.

431
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,798
Looks like you'll be
missing the festival this year.

432
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:09,703
Gum-Gum--
Billy Club Bodhisattva!

433
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,142
There.
Let's head back to town.

434
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,044
[SANJI]
Sounds good.

435
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:18,545
[LUFFY]
You coming, too, Monk?

436
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,579
[ZORO]
Sure.

437
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:25,085
[BUGGY] Thank you
for all your hard work!

438
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,827
[CHOPPER]
I don't understand.

439
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,363
Theoretically, that
should have healed him.

440
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:40,200
[LUFFY]
Carrot! Carrot!

441
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:44,037
Hey, Carrot! Hey!

442
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,124
Look!

443
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,161
We found the
millennium sakura tree!

444
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:08,495
Hey, Carrot!

445
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,731
Hope this'll make
you feel better!

446
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,500
Get well soon
so we can go play!

447
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,336
You dummies.

448
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,371
Worrying about me like that.

449
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,240
[RIKA laughing]

450
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,553
Thanks so much!

451
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:37,758
[USOPP] Come on!
Over here! A little closer!

452
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,393
Thank you, guys!

453
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,561
I'm feeling better already!

454
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,301
[CHOPPER] Whoa.
He is feeling better!

455
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,336
Did my medicine
finally start working?

456
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,807
[laughing]

457
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,476
[CHOPPER]
No.

458
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:58,478
I think it was a different
kind of medicine.

459
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:15,262
[LUCCI]
After all that talk,

460
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:18,265
I was expecting an opponent
with a little more backbone.

461
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:19,700
How disappointing.

462
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,202
Did you run out of strength
after that last attack?

463
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,571
[LUFFY] If it's
backbone you want,

464
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,806
wait'll you get a
load of my next move!

465
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,608
It's time to end this!

466
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,476
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

467
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,179
"I Can't Protect
Anyone Unless I Win!

468
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,214
Third Gear Activated!"
