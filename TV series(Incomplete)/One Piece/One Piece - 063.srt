[MISS WEDNESDAY]
It's been an interesting ride

177
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,338
to say the least.

178
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,941
[MR. 9] Perhaps we'll
meet again someday!

179
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,943
Bye‐bye, baby!

180
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,083
That's a quick exit.

181
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,452
I guess we'll never learn what
those nut jobs were up to.

182
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,988
Aw, who cares!
We're landing!

183
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,425
[NAMI] Well, there's a waterway
right up to the shoreline.

184
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,294
It looks like we
can go inland by ship.

185
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,166
Um, I'm weighing the possibility
of monsters out there.

186
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,301
It's definitely a possibility.

187
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,036
This is the Grand Line.

188
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,971
No problem.

189
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,473
If we find monsters,
we can just leave...

190
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:08,841
That's not true...

191
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,142
According to what Crocus said,

192
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,178
it's imperative we
stay on this island,

193
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,313
at least for a little while.

194
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,982
But why?

195
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,283
The Log Pose needs enough time

196
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,318
to record the island's
magnetic field.

197
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,887
So, until that's done,
we have to stay put.

198
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,155
The Log Pose can require

199
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,890
a different amount
of time for each island.

200
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,060
Some will take a few hours,
others may take several days...

201
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,996
Suppose this island is
crawling with monsters,

202
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,631
but we get stuck here waiting...

203
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,332
That's stupid. We'd be done for!

204
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,234
What's the point of gathering
navigation coordinates

205
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,402
if your dead?

206
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,337
[NAMI]
We're staying.

207
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,873
Lets not think about the
monsters till we have to.

208
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,241
They're not even there.

209
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,676
As strange as this seems...

210
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,178
I agree. There's no
need to worry yet.

211
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,213
Now that that's settled.

212
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,516
Let's get going , and
I'll keep you safe Nami...

213
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,385
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it.

214
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,020
It's this cold‐‐it's
a condition really.

215
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,188
You guys should
just go on without me.

216
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,924
All right, get ready... and...

217
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,361
Make sure you're prepared
to run, as well as fight.

218
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,663
[USOPP] In fact, it's
commonly referred to

219
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,665
as "Don't Go to
the Island" disease.

220
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,533
Heard of it? No?

221
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,202
[SANJI] What's waiting
for us out there?

222
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,338
[USOPP]
Please don't let us die!

223
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,086
[MAN A]
Hey, it's a pirate ship.

224
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,427
[MAN B] A new group
of pirates are here...

225
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,490
Something's moving over there.

226
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,292
[SANJI]
Who are they?

227
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,495
Now be on your guard, everyone.

228
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,430
Well, I may have
to fight monsters,

229
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,499
but at least I came prepared!

230
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,468
[USOPP]
Whoever's out there, I'm ready!

231
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,903
Show yourself and face my wrath!

232
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:27,847
[cheering]

233
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,117
[TOWNSPERSON A]
Welcome to the Grand Line!

234
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,519
[TOWNSPERSON B] Greetings and
good tidings, brave travelers!

235
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,755
[TOWNSPERSON C] We're happy
to have you here in Whisky Peak!

236
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,156
Why, those aren't monsters,

237
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,326
they're people and they actually
seem happy we're here...

238
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,996
What the hell's wrong with 'em?

239
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,499
[TOWNSPERSON D] Pirates are
always welcome in our town!

240
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,834
[TOWNSPERSON E] Hurray for
the heroes of the sea!

241
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,540
Whoa, yeah!

242
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,642
I've never seen so
many cute girls in one place!

243
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,845
[WOMEN]
Hey, handsome! You're cute!

244
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,014
[USOPP] I guess some
folks consider pirates

245
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,849
to be heroes. Who knew?!

246
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,851
Man, I should have
come here ages ago!

247
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,686
[LUFFY]
Hey!

248
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,127
[IGARAPPOI]
Welc‐‐ [coughs]

249
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,897
Ma‐ma‐ma...

250
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,732
Welcome!

251
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,003
My name is Igarappoi,

252
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,540
and it is my honor as mayor
to welcome you to Whisky Peak.

253
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,875
Oh... Great! I'm Luffy.
Nice to meet you...

254
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,178
Nice hair. I like the curls...

255
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,646
You'll find that this is a place

256
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,048
that thrives on
making liquor and music.

257
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,651
Hospitality is a matter
of pride in our town.

258
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,685
The smiles run long,

259
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,688
and the liquor flows
as bountiful as seawater.

260
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,823
Would you permit
us to throw a party

261
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:48,093
in honor of your arrival
so that we may hear... [coughs]

262
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,597
Ma‐ma‐ma...

263
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,532
...your tales of adventure?!

264
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,067
‐‐[USOPP] With pleasure!
‐‐[LUFFY, SANJI] Be glad to!

265
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,003
[laughter]

266
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,572
Idiots...

267
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,173
By the way, how
long until the Log Pose

268
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,742
records this islands
magnetic field?

269
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,777
Log what...? Oh...

270
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,513
Such boring details
will have too keep for now.

271
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,682
Surely you'd like to
rest after your journey.

272
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,784
Now, lets prepare to party...!

273
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,587
Sing and be merry!
Entertain our guests!

274
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,425
[cheering]

275
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,088
Then I looked 'em straight
in the eye and I said,

276
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,056
"Sea Kings, you don't
dare touch my friends,

277
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,791
or you'll have to answer to me."

278
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,759
Oh, wow!

279
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,662
You're amazing, Captain Usopp!

280
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,764
Well, even I trembled
when facing

281
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,666
the deadly landscape
of the Calm Belt.

282
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,135
Trembled with
excitement, that is.

283
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:03,936
Really?!

284
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,171
You're a true hero!

285
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,641
[IGARAPPOI] Please, don't hold
back on my account. Drink up!

286
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,977
Uh, no... Thanks,
but I'm not drinking.

287
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,079
Don't worr‐‐ [coughs]

288
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,982
Ma‐ma‐ma...

289
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,017
Don't you worry...

290
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,619
What you have there
is a very special drink...

291
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,822
Made by using only the
very sweetest premium grapes.

292
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,992
It contains all the flavorful
benefits of a fine wine,

293
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,160
but zero alcohol.

294
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,695
[NAMI]
I see...

295
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,998
Yeah, you're right!
It's delicious!

296
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,000
We had an excellent
grape harvest this year.

297
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,136
Now, to celebrate that harvest,

298
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,272
our traditional
toast competition!

299
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,675
It's simple.
Make a toast, take a drink.

300
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,010
This continues for as long
as you can hold your liquor.

301
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,680
Last one standing is
the winner... Join us!

302
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,847
No, thanks. You go ahead.

303
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,649
I'd rather watch
the competition.

304
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,951
Did I mention that the prize

305
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,852
is one hundred
thousand berries?!

306
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,789
Then fill'er up!

307
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,691
Zoro! Stand up and join us!

308
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,225
You need the money, don't you?!

309
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,327
[ZORO]
Huh?!

310
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,967
[DRUNK MAN A]
Whoa! That's his 10th mug!

311
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,669
[DRUNK MAN B]
No more!

312
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,837
That's it; I'm done!

313
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,005
Good...

314
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,740
[DRUNK MAN C] That girl's
drinking 'em under the table

315
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
with mug number twelve!

316
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,877
More!

317
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,679
Give me more!

318
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,814
[MAN D]
Unbelievable!

319
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,882
The captain just finished
a meal fit for 20 people!

320
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,918
[MAN E]
The cook is down!

321
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,253
Good night.

322
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,823
[MAN E] Whoa! This pirate's
trying to hit on 20 girls

323
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,224
at the same time!

324
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,393
[MAN F] We don't stand
a chance with these pirates!

325
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,396
Hahaha! This is truly a fun...

326
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:41,900
[coughs] Ma‐ma‐ma...

327
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,202
...a fun‐filled night!

328
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,703
It pleases me to see you all

329
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:49,708
enjoying the celebration
with such vigor! Hahahaha!

330
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,014
Oh, yes, indeed,
I'm quite pleased.

331
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,416
[MR. 9] We do formally
admit complete failure

332
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,184
in our mission to secure food...

333
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,220
However, it should
be duly noted...

334
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,189
That without the slightest
concern for our well‐being,

335
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,359
we bravely succeeded in leading
the gang to Cactus Island.

336
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,063
Sincerely, and with best
regards, etc., etc. baby...

337
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,065
There, that'll do...

338
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,268
Now, we submit this,
and with any luck...

339
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,636
All is forgiven.

340
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,771
Right. I'll drop it

341
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,607
in the Unluckies'
Box immediately.

342
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,647
[MISS WEDNESDAY] They'll
deliver it to the boss for us.

343
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,418
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
I hope it works...

344
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,723
[ZORO] I'm calling it quits...
Need to get some sleep.

345
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,093
[MAN G] That one's finally
down after drinking 13 mugs!

346
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,328
Aw, come on!
You quitin' already Zoro?

347
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,329
You wuss...

348
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,132
[MAN H] Only two left,
and they're both women!

349
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,834
[MAN I] 15th mug‐‐
Pirate versus Sister!

350
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,969
My child, forfeit
for your own sake,

351
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,937
there's no disgrace.

352
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,807
Ha! Well, I appreciate
the concern, Sister,

353
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,942
but you're not getting
me to quit that easy...

354
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,977
Hahahaha!

355
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,148
This is a new
feeling I think it's full...

356
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,983
[MAN J]
Three cooks are down!

357
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,119
Glad to hear it... Thanks...

358
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,956
I'm out.

359
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:15,327
I won!! Hahahaha!

360
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,329
The prize money's mine!

361
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,997
[MAN K]
She's finally down!

362
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,933
[sighs]

363
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,136
Whiskey Peak!
What a marvelous town!

364
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,206
We've stumbled
upon pure paradise!

365
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,717
[IGARAPPOI] They've worn
themselves out partying

366
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,985
and are fast asleep.

367
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,056
[IGARAPPOI]
Sweet dreams...

368
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,025
[IGARAPPOI]
...brave adventurers.

369
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,196
[IGARAPPOI]
My, how the Cactus Rocks gleam

370
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,298
under the pale moonlight...

371
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,200
Beautiful as ever.

372
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,536
[MR. 9]
If I may say,

373
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,806
your poetic skills are
beyond compare, Igarappoi...

374
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,508
I mean, Mr. 8.

375
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,510
[IGARAPPOI]
Oh, it's you.

376
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,312
[MISS WEDNESDAY]
So where are they?

377
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,814
[IGARAPPOI]
They're falling...

378
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,486
...straight to hell.

379
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,726
[MISS MONDAY]
Damn my head is killing me.

380
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,729
Our guests didn't have the good
taste to pass out gracefully,

381
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,564
so I doctored
their drinks a little...

382
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,567
Otherwise, they'd still be up
drinking us all into oblivion.

383
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,701
So, tell me...

384
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,936
Was it really necessary

385
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,539
to put on this elaborate
show for those idiots...

386
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,510
I get that nobody
wants to hear me whine,

387
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,547
but it's my duty to point out
the amount of food we wasted,

388
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,715
when we could've just
ambushed them at the harbor.

389
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,584
We're already
short on supplies.

390
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,419
It's not like anyone
had high hopes

391
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,554
for that whale
meat or anything.

392
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,589
Well, why don't you go try
and kill that damn whale?!

393
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,590
We tried our best you know...

394
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,058
[IGARAPPOI] Both of
you calm yourselves...!

395
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,060
Before you question
the validity of my plan,

396
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,895
you should see this...

397
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,932
What?! Thirty million berries?!

398
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,100
For those morons?!

399
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,468
Don't be foolish...

400
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,737
Appearances can be deceiving.

401
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,638
That goes for‐‐

402
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,943
[coughs] Ma‐ma‐ma...

403
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,412
That goes for all of you.

404
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,813
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,616
It's no matter,
our prey has been trapped...

406
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,718
And that's news
the boss will enjoy...

407
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,888
For now confiscate everything
of value from their ship...

408
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,890
So what do we do with them now?

409
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:25,991
Kill them?

410
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,461
[IGARAPPOI] If they die,
the bounty drops thirty percent.

411
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,298
The Government prefers
to hold public executions.

412
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,971
Now, go!
I want them alive!

413
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,807
[ZORO]
Hey... Sorry to interrupt.

414
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,510
Do you mind lettin'
my friends sleep?

415
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,946
They've had a long day,
and the journey was exhausting,

416
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,815
so I've been told.

417
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,455
Hey, Mr. 8! Miss Monday!

418
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,625
One of them escaped from the
room when we weren't looking!

419
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,993
He's right over there!

420
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,461
[IGARAPPOI]
Sneaky wretch!

421
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,130
You should've stayed
asleep with your friends!

422
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,865
A good swordsman
never makes the mistake

423
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,502
of letting his guard down‐‐plus,
I took a nap earlier.

424
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,604
Judging by the scowls
and cheap disguises,

425
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,873
I'm guessing you're
all bounty hunters.

426
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,675
Your specialty is
robbing drunk pirates

427
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,810
who fall for your hospitality...

428
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,880
It's original,
I'll give you that at least...

429
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,851
I count a hundred of
you scumbags, give or take.

430
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,689
And I'll fight all of you,
you hear me, Baroque Works?!

431
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,892
Ah! How do you know our name?!

432
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,695
I was in a similar line
of work once upon a time...

433
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,564
Your company tried to
entice me with a job offer.

434
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,400
Naturally, I said no.

435
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,201
Do the same rules still apply‐‐

436
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,672
Employee identities kept
secret, cheesy code names.

437
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,875
The boss' identity and
whereabouts‐‐also a mystery...

00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,045
Baroque Works: The criminal
group that faithfully carries

439
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,548
out their orders‐‐like
herded sheep. Hmph!

440
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,717
That's some secret.

441
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,920
[IGARAPPOI]
This is a surprise...

442
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,889
If you know all of our secrets,

443
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,159
then we are left with no
other choice but to kill you.

444
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:12,164
And another gravestone...

445
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,434
Shall be added to
the cactus rocks tonight...

446
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,961
Kill him!

448
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,801
