00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,656
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,393
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,994
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,964
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,532
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,268
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,970
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,939
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,742
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,378
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,945
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,016
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,719
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:09,056
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,259
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:16,997
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,570
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,805
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,974
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:30,945
[NARRATOR] Fighting alongside
Whitebeard and his associates,

21
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,547
he continues to push
toward the scaffold.

22
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,148
As the all-out battle continues

23
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,352
between the Navy's elite and the
strongest pirates in the world,

24
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,223
Luffy puts his life on the line,
vowing death before defeat!

25
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,891
[SENGOKU]
Concerned about the future?

26
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,394
I'll be more than happy
to show it to you now.

27
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,762
Let's end this.

28
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,263
Execute him!

29
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,202
[LUFFY pants]
I'm too slow!

30
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,137
Don't make me laugh!

31
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,708
You think I can't stop
those runts from doing it?

32
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,077
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

33
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,612

[LUFFY grunts]

39
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,979
Did you just do
what I think you did?

40
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,948
It's the Conqueror's... Spirit!

41
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:44,552
Well damn. This is a mess.

42
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,120
There's a surprise for you.

43
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,593
Why, that little brat.

44
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,265
[LUFFY]
"The Scaffold at Last!

45
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,901
The Way to Ace Has Opened!"

46
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,278
We're good!

47
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,913
Ace is still alive, guys!

48
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,015
Hey! Pull it together, pal!

49
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,219
That power--it came
from Ace's brother, huh?

50
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,386
What the...

51
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,955
I almost passed out back there.

52
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,725
[LUFFY yelling]

53
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,362
That was the Conqueror's Spirit.

54
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,132
Like Pops and Shanks use.

55
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:35,035
Damn. That kid is
full of surprises, huh?

56
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,638
I don't think he realizes
what he just did.

57
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,609
I tell you, boys, we got
some scary stuff right here.

58
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,278
[PIRATE C groans]

59
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,787
He didn't learn that power,
he was born with it.

60
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,589
Just like Pops.

61
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,325
If your will is
weak, stand back!

62
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,795
He's not just another rookie!

63
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,629
Conqueror's Spirit, huh?

64
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,165
We can't forget he's
the son of Dragon.

65
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,601
That's what we get for
underestimating him.

66
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,303
What next, Vice Admiral?

67
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,238
My energy hormones
didn't do that!

68
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,407
What hat did you pull
those powers out of?

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,909
Power? What d'you mean?

70
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,743
We'll discuss it later!

71
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,078
[IVANKOV]
He's not aware of it.

72
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,514
That means we can't count
on him using it again.

73
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,550
Either way, it's no wonder that
people are so drawn to him!

74
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:27,454
The apple doesn't fall far from
the tree, does it, Dragon?

75
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,559
[DOBERMAN] Do not let that
boy escape this battlefield.

76
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,495
If he does, he'll turn
into a dire threat to us!

77
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,865
Dead or alive,
you take him down!

[WHITEBEARD chuckles]

84
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,993
Scared to death of a mere
boy and an old man?

85
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,763
You were so cocky before,
but where's your fire now?

86
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,366
I thought you wanted to kill me!

Focus on Whitebeard first!

He may be a monster,
but he's injured!

91
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,513
Take him down,
then go for the kid!

92
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,848
Heh. Just try it.

93
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,520
Don't let a single Marine
lay a hand on him!

They're aiming for Whitebeard!

Move those buns
while you still can!

We finally make headway

105

and the bastards start
pulling it together.

Thinks he can push through.

107
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,635
He'll be pushing up
daisies first.

108

as I've got these things on.

There's a new plan!

I'm either gonna live
or I'm gonna die.

119

Pardon me, Vice Admiral,

00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,950
but I require a moment of
your time, if you would.

We've got some friends!

If Whitebeard says
to lend you a hand,

then we're on it in a flash!

[IVANKOV]
Heehaw!

Ace may be your brother, but
he's Whitebeard's son, you know.

trying to be coy

and rise to the occasion,
you cocky little snot!

that old man wants,

what he thinks, either.

to do one thing!

They're too busy gawking at that

Now I've got to do
something flashy in a flash,

00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,535
so people stop watching

Just defrost the damn thing.

Give it a quick dip in that

260

melt right off.

00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,910
Pops said to watch your back.

357
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,178
So keep running. We got this.

358
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,085
Everyone push.
We're breaking through!

359
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:24,157
[MARINES yelling]

360
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,926
[FOSSA grunts]

361
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,628
[BLENHEIM grunts]

362
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:33,133
[MARINES screaming]

363
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,401
Here he comes, men!

364
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:36,336
Gum-Gum...

365
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,841
...Battle Axe!

366
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,475
[MARINES groan]

367
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,916
Take it straight to the top.

368
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,984
[LUFFY]
You got it! Thanks!

369
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,421
[MARINE FF]
He's getting away!

370
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,990
[IVANKOV]
Death Wink!

371
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,226
[MARINES groan]

372
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,396
If you really wanna rumble,
then step right up!

373
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,433
Heehaw!

374
00:21:05,466 --> 00:21:08,402
Now you just keep on
shining, Straw Boy!

375
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,237
[PIRATE AA]
It worked! He's gonna make it!

376
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,840
[PIRATE BB]
We got this! We really got this!

377
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:16,109
[MARINE GG]
It's not over! Pull him down!

378
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,312
Straw Hat! Save Ace!

379
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,714
Yeah, it's all you
from here on out!

380
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:22,883
I've got to admit,
I didn't think Whitebeard

381
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,819
would gamble it all on you.

382
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,787
It's been a fun ride,

383
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,956
but don't kid yourself, boy.

384
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,595
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

385
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:40,133
Well, don't that beat all.

386
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,668
It's gonna be a good show,

387
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,404
why don't you just
sit back and watch?

388
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:47,807
[LUFFY panting]

389
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:56,984
[ACE gasping]

390
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,451
Luffy!

391
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,956
We did it!

392
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,158
I'm here!

393
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,528
[LUFFY gasps]

394
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,398
[PIRATES gasp]

395
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,642
[MARINE HH]
Is Garp gonna fight, too?

396
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,212
Grandpa!

397
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:27,748
Get outta the way!

398
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,317
I'm not moving a damned inch!

399
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm a vice admiral of the Navy!

400
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:37,925
I've been fighting pirates since
long before you were born,

401
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,594
and I ain't stopping today!

402
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,062
Old man!

403
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,700
You're not my grandson here.

404
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:49,536
You are the pirate,
Straw Hat Luffy.

405
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,805
And I'll fight you to the death.

406
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:54,208
[LUFFY gasps]

407
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:58,045
This is the path that
you chose to take!

408
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:00,714
You and your brother alike!

409
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,864
[NARRATOR] Thanks to
Inazuma's makeshift bridge,

410
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,232
Luffy is able to ascend
to the scaffold.

411
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:22,703
Garp, unable to watch any
longer, leaps into Luffy's path.

412
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,537
Maintaining his
pride as a Marine,

413
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,007
he faces his own
grandson in battle,

414
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,477
cursing the life of piracy
that Luffy and Ace chose.

415
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:32,313
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

416
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,616
"Each on Different Paths!
Luffy vs. Garp!"

417
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:38,418
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
