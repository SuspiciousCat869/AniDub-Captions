[MARINE O] You think
he's gonna melt, or what?

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:54.321
[FRANKY groaning]

00:14:54.354 --> 00:14:56.692
I'm dying...

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.237
Hey, gotcha.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.107
[MARINES gasp]

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:07.581
Ha, ha! You really think
that's all it's gonna take?

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:10.888
The fire from those crappy toys
didn't even slow me down.

00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:15.697
In fact, I'm feeling just super!

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:16.966
[MARINE P]
Dammit!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.780
Well, you did get my hair.
What look should I go with next?

00:15:23.813 --> 00:15:26.586
Allow three seconds for styling.

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:29.458
[MARINES]
Eh?

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:32.531
[FRANKY]
This one? Nah...

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:34.502
Not feelin' it.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.082
You know, this was good.

00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:42.651
He's screwin' with us!

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:45.056
Don't worry,
I'm not runnin' away!

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:48.429
Smile! [chuckles]

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:52.772
C'mon! Don't get shy on
me now, boys. Let's party.

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.009
[BASTILLE]
Open fire!

00:16:33.318 --> 00:16:35.758
[USOPP] Toys are coming out
one after the other!

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.193
Sugar is making them.

00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:40.968
We were right.
She's in the tower.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.341
What are those tentacle
things up there?

00:16:44.374 --> 00:16:46.178
[LEO] There's an exclusive
lift for the Executives

00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:48.917
in the middle.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.486
But those pipes on the sides

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.027
are where Big People and
broken toys get tossed in.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:58.637
[LEO] They all lead here,
but those giant chutes

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.175
can be found everywhere
in Dressrosa.

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.611
When someone falls through one,

00:17:02.645 --> 00:17:04.949
they'll drop past us and
straight to a scrap heap

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:07.219
below the Executive Tower.

00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:12.564
[USOPP whimpers]

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:16.172
[TOY MAN A screams]
Someone help!

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:18.342
[TOY WOMAN A screams]

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:27.962
[CAVENDISH]
Revolting!

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:30.466
First I'm thrown into
the garbage and now this?

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.203
What is this place?

00:17:32.237 --> 00:17:35.744
[MEDIC A] You are the pirate,
Cavendish, correct?

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:37.347
[CAVENDISH]
Yes. That's right.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.184
[MEDIC A] We need to do
an examination.

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:42.189
Why would you do that?
Clearly, I'm in perfect health.

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.830
[CAVENDISH screams]

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:51.743
[CAVENDISH] Ugh! What sort
of nonsense is this?

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:56.017
[CAVENDISH groaning, screaming]

00:17:57.019 --> 00:17:59.324
[CAVENDISH] It seems
I've fallen into a trap.

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:01.428
And a slimy one, unfortunately.

00:18:01.462 --> 00:18:02.831
Should have known
something was amiss

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:04.401
when they took me
to the medical room.

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.672
I wasn't even hurt, after all.

00:18:06.706 --> 00:18:10.113
[TREBOL] It's not "slimy,"
you big silly. It's "sticky."

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:13.587
[gasps] Whoa. Hello!
What is this place?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.293
[TREBOL laughs]
It's the Executive Tower.

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:19.665
Also, it's where toys come from.

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:21.770
Though outsiders
wouldn't understand.

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:22.872
But since you're here,

00:18:22.905 --> 00:18:24.842
you're not really
an outsider, huh?

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.946
So we might as well
tell you the other name

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:28.884
we have for this special room.

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:31.989
Sugar! Tell him for me.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.402
I don't care.

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:42.110
Why?! [cries]

00:18:42.143 --> 00:18:45.818
Look what you did!
It's a double snot rope!

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:47.788
Just die. You're gross.

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:49.725
No! You die!

00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:53.065
Sorry, but I don't take orders
from little brats like you!

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.502
[laughing]

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:56.573
Can you help me, kid?
I'm stuck.

00:18:56.606 --> 00:18:59.410
Gotta get this
sticky goo off of me.

00:19:03.385 --> 00:19:04.788
Huh...?

00:19:07.193 --> 00:19:09.130
Here's your contract.

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:12.169
You will not do harm
to any human.

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:16.779
And you will follow all
orders from the Family.

00:19:16.812 --> 00:19:21.054
I'm confused. And wait.
What happened to my body?

00:19:21.087 --> 00:19:22.156
Change me back!

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.229
[TREBOL] Stop talking
and get to work, 'kay?

00:19:25.263 --> 00:19:26.432
[gasping]

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.804
[CAVENDISH]
Huh? I can't talk!

00:19:28.837 --> 00:19:30.907
Why am I obeying this idiot?

00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:34.280
And you will follow all
orders from the Family.

00:19:34.313 --> 00:19:36.084
[CAVENDISH]
The contract?

00:19:36.117 --> 00:19:41.128
[laughing] One more thing.
Nobody remembers you!

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:44.267
Even I forgot who you
were a second ago.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.138
Now, you're gonna work for Doffy

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:49.845
until you break down and
we have to throw you away!

00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:52.349
[laughing]

00:19:52.383 --> 00:19:53.620
[CAVENDISH]
How is this happening?

00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:55.323
I'm some kind of toy slave?

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:58.028
[TREBOL] Keep walking straight
till you hit the port,

00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:02.403
then get to work! [laughs]

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:12.925
Oh, new guy?
I'll show you where to go.

00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.462
[CAVENDISH]
Is this a port?

00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:17.567
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE N]
Keep moving!

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:19.204
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE M]
Here! Now get to work!

00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:21.141
[CAVENDISH gasping]

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:23.880
[CAVENDISH]
I'm a pirate, damn it!

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:27.020
What kind of nightmare is this?
And how do I wake up?

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.055
[CAVENDISH gasps]

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.994
There. Your box. Now go.

00:20:31.028 --> 00:20:33.165
[CAVENDISH]
No! These toys are creepy!

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:34.635
I don't want to be one of them!

00:20:34.668 --> 00:20:38.543
And I especially don't want
to slave away until I die!

00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:46.826
[SAI] So this is where
they trade the weapons

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:48.462
to the warring nations.

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:52.771
But I'm powerless to stop it!
I'm helping them!

00:20:52.804 --> 00:20:55.276
[HACK] This is just the lead
we were looking for!

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:57.848
If only I had a
transponder snail!

00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:59.418
Koala's waiting for me.

00:20:59.451 --> 00:21:02.423
There must be some way
to regain control!

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:04.127
[ELIZABELLO]
Curse you, Doflamingo!

00:21:04.161 --> 00:21:05.663
I'm the King of Prodence!

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:08.168
"Work as a toy
until I break down"?

00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:11.809
Is that a joke?
Somebody help me!

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.517
[USOPP]
Sneak, sneak.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:25.302
[ROBIN] That must be Sugar
talking to Trebol.

00:21:25.335 --> 00:21:26.739
[USOPP]
She really is a kid.

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:28.108
[LEO]
In appearance.

00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:30.513
Anyway, we know
she loves grapes.

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:32.183
She eats them constantly.

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:33.452
And why do I care?

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:37.794
[LEO] We have a plan.
And a secret weapon!

00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:41.502
Looks like a grape but it's
a clump of Tatababasco.

00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:45.076
It's the hottest spice
in the world!

00:21:45.109 --> 00:21:47.881
Hold on, you're gonna
make her eat it?

00:21:47.914 --> 00:21:50.821
[LEO] We just have to
sneak it into the basket!

00:21:50.854 --> 00:21:54.127
We tested it before on 50
people from our tribe.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.668
All of them were knocked out
cold and 18 of them almost died!

00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:58.837
[LEO laughs]

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.707
[DWARVES chuckle]

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.976
That sounds bad!

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:05.817
It better be! We can't
take any risks!

00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:10.392
'Kay. Leo. Go. I'll be
watching you from here.

00:22:10.426 --> 00:22:12.698
[LEO]
I feel stronger already!

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:17.139
[USOPP] If this goes south,
I'm cuttin' out!

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.141
Good luck, Leo!

00:22:18.174 --> 00:22:19.912
[DWARVES cheer]

00:22:19.945 --> 00:22:22.250
Shut up! Are you crazy?

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:24.120
Don't let Trebol notice you!

00:22:24.154 --> 00:22:25.524
[DWARVES]
Be careful!

00:22:25.557 --> 00:22:27.962
Hey, they're gonna hear you!

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:33.172
This is just the start.
Everyone, prepare yourselves.

00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:35.811
The moment that Sugar screams

00:22:35.844 --> 00:22:38.048
is the moment when
every toy in the kingdom

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:41.555
regains their human
form at long last.

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:45.463
And the other citizens will
reclaim their lost memories.

00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:48.268
The truth of this land
will be revealed.

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:53.212
All of Doflamingo's evil will
be dragged out into the light!

00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:56.451
We will save our friends,
and Dressrosa as well!

00:22:56.484 --> 00:22:58.422
[DWARVES cheering]

00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:00.827
I told you, you're too loud!

00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:03.866
King Riku will claim this
kingdom once more!

00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:05.570
[DWARVES cheer]

00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:09.845
Please, shut up!
They're gonna hear you!

00:23:14.522 --> 00:23:15.924
[NARRATOR]
As the suspenseful tournament

00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.261
for the Flame Flame Fruit
continues to rage,

00:23:18.294 --> 00:23:20.199
Burgess of the
Blackbeard Pirates

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.069
pits his deadly Shockwave Elbow

00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:24.641
against Lucy's all-destroying
dragon power.

00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:27.548
Soon, the crowd will witness
the immeasurable strength

00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:29.818
of the man who will
inherit Ace's will!

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:31.722
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:35.730
"Dragon Claw Strikes!
Lucy's Intimidating Attack!"

00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:39.070
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
