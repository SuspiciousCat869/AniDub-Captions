00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,884
Blood can harden
sand, too, can't it?

175
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,861
[chuckles]

176
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,530
[CROCODILE] First Rainbase,
and then the royal palace,

177
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,067
and now this underground temple.

178
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,805
You should be rewarded for your
insistence on challenging me.

179
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,374
Even after I've put you
through hell twice now,

180
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,142
you keep on coming back.

181
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,377
[LUFFY]
Why, you!

182
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,583
[CROCODILE]
You're a pirate, Straw Hat.

183
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,886
You've certainly proven
that in your determination

184
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,388
to defeat me no matter the cost.

185
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,656
And I'll admit that
you've become

186
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,391
an annoyingly
persistent opponent

187
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,760
during our three encounters.

188
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,164
All right. What's that?

189
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,066
[CROCODILE]
A poisonous hook.

190
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,067
I see.

191
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,103
You seem to be a competent
pirate, I suppose.

192
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,072
So surely, you must understand

193
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,574
that a duel between
pirates is always about

194
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,843
two people fighting
for survival.

195
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,111
And when that's the case,

196
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,514
there's no such thing
as playing dirty.

197
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,118
[CROCODILE chuckles]

198
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,989
When the explosion
happens in the Square,

199
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,093
this place will most
likely crumble to dust.

200
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,028
This will be our final battle,

201
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,231
so let's settle this
once and for all!

202
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,587
[ZORO] The smoke was coming
from this direction, wasn't it?

203
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,090
[ZORO]
Or was it? Argh.

204
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,925
[MARINE A gasp]

205
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,193
Wha‐‐? The Marines?

206
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,129
Hey, look. It's Roronoa Zoro.

207
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,263
Just great.

208
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,432
I didn't realize the Marines
were in this town now.

209
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,801
I don't have time for this.

210
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:49,969
Oh, damn it.

211
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,138
I guess I have no choice but
to deal with them quickly.

212
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,440
Why are you here in the
middle of the battlefield?

213
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,041
Yeah, what do you think
you're doing here?

214
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,444
Well, I could say the
same thing to you!

215
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,612
[MARINE B]
Hold it, Zoro!

216
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
We know that you have absolutely
no sense of direction,

217
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,517
but this is just ridiculous,
even for you.

218
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,451
Go that way.

219
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,952
If you head north
at the next corner,

220
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,788
then you can reach
the Palace Square.

221
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,956
[MARINE D] Go back and
turn right! It's not this way!

222
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,525
[MARINE C]
Are you that stupid?

223
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,526
[ZORO]
Stupid?

224
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,460
[MARINE B]
Get outta here!

225
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,461
[MARINE C]
Go!

226
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,464
Uh. What the‐‐? How di...?

227
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,201
[BILLIONS shouting]

228
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,805
Faster! We have to
run faster, Vivi!

229
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,039
I don't think I can, Usopp!

230
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,643
Don't let the princess get away!
Our promotions are on the line.

231
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,078
[BILLIONS screaming]

232
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,547
[USOPP]
Huh?

233
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,057
[BOTH gasp]

234
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,828
Uh... Thank you?

235
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,763
We're here to help
you, not fight!

236
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,199
Go stop the explosion
in the Square, okay?

237
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,066
Now go, quickly!

238
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,669
Let's get going Usopp.
Come on, hurry.

239
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,505
‐‐[USOPP] Right!
‐‐[VIVI] Thank you!

240
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,274
Your orders are to assist
them in any way you can.

241
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,275
Move out!

242
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,777
[MARINES]
Right!

243
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,946
Are we chasing after
the Straw Hat Pirates?

244
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,049
Or, uh, reinforcing
the royal army?

245
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,684
[SMOKER]
That's up to you.

246
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,019
You'll have to decide
which is more important

247
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,188
when you get there.

248
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,091
Rely on your sense of justice.

249
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,762
Whatever happens,
I'll accept responsibility.

250
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,545
[USOPP]
Hurry! We have to hurry!

251
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,080
We've wasted a lot of time!

252
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,048
I don't know why they
helped us back there,

253
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,083
but if it weren't
for the Marines,

254
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,552
we'd be a lot worse off now!

255
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,564
[USOPP]
No, don't look at that!

256
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,732
We don't have time to help them!

257
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:00,733
If we don't stop the explosion,

258
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,769
the casualties will be
a lot worse than that!

259
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,004
Right.

260
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,240
Crying about it isn't gonna
stop the attack from happening!

261
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,113
[USOPP] In two minutes,
we're either gonna beat them,

262
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,180
or we're gonna die.

263
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,749
We still have time left!

264
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:17,583
[VIVI]
Yes!

265
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,084
[USOPP]
And we're all helping you!

266
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,586
[VIVI]
Yes!

267
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,260
Right there! Vivi! Usopp!

268
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,829
It's Nami! And Tony!

269
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,764
What's going on?

270
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,766
The Marines just helped
us out back there!

271
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,768
Were you able to find
where the cannon is?

272
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,769
We haven't confirmed it yet,

273
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,171
but that's this is the
only place it can be!

274
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:42,141
We must've passed it a bunch
of times before I realized it.

275
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:46,045
The cannon is up there.
I'm absolutely sure of it now.

276
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,122
[gasps]

277
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,357
The clock tower?

278
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,625
I see.

279
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,994
From up there, he can get a
really good shot at the Square.

280
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,963
We still need Pell
to get here, though.

281
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,365
It's the only way to stop it.

282
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,967
Pell.

283
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,378
[PELL]
We don't have much time.

284
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,246
I could've sworn I saw
the smoke coming up

285
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,016
from somewhere around this area.

286
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,828
[gunshot]

287
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,830
[MISS FATHER'S DAY]
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

288
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,998
Did you see that?

289
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,434
I just shot down that big bird
with my Ribbit‐Ribbit Gun.

290
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,769
Quite impressive, huh?

291
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,072
[MR. 7 laughing]

292
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,876
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,144
[LUFFY yells]

294
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,775
Gum‐Gum Pistol!

295
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:02,081
[LUFFY yells]

296
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,826
[BOTH yelling]

297
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,974
[COBRA] He's so strong.
Who in the world is he?

298
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,410
Crocodile made even our best
warriors look like children.

299
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,313
But now, he's
actually struggling.

300
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,052
[chuckles]

301
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,525
[CROCODILE] You were skewered,
buried alive, and dried up.

302
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,427
You may have made it
through all that,

303
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,564
but you won't escape
this time, Straw Hat.

304
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,399
There's no hope for survival.

305
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,268
The game is over.

306
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,337
This poison will spread
through you soon.

307
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,874
You know, Crocodile?
You just don't understand.

308
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,520
[VIVI]
I wonder what happened.

309
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,192
Pell? I don't see him
up there anywhere.

310
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,527
But I don't think there's
any way that we can get

311
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,063
to the top of the tower in less
than a minute without any help.

312
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,232
Pell, where are you?
Hurry. We need you.

313
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,035
For now, we're going to have
to get moving without him.

314
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,903
We're gonna have to climb
all these use the stairs.

315
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,038
You guys ready?

316
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,239
[SANJI]
Hey!

317
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:07,973
[ALL]
Huh?

318
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,876
Nami! Hey, Vivi!

319
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,278
[USOPP] Sanji, what are you
doing all the way up there?

320
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,379
[SANJI]
What do you think?

321
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,050
You left a message where
the smoke was, didn't you?

322
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,952
The message said
"Go to the clock tower,"

323
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,621
so I figured I'd better
head up here to meet you.

324
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,089
So what should I do?

325
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,791
Where's the cannoneer, anyway?

326
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,893
[USOPP]
The top! He's at the top!

327
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,662
Go up from there
and take him down!

328
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,564
[ZORO]
Sanji?

329
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey! Where were you?
I was looking!

330
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,002
[SANJI]
Zoro! You're here, too?

331
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,904
[ZORO]
What are you doin' down there?

332
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,939
[SANJI] Funny, I was gonna
ask you the same thing!

333
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,840
[ZORO]
It was the Marines.

334
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,842
They kept saying
"go north, go north,"

335
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,745
so I just kept going north till
I got all the way up here.

336
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,914
[SANJI] "North" and "up"
aren't the same thing!

337
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,916
Anyway, good job, you two!

338
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,584
Now just keep on
going up from there

339
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,152
and destroy the
clock tower, okay?

340
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,854
No way!

341
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,689
They can't get inside
the clock tower

342
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,790
from where they are now.

343
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,926
You see, there are
only two ways in:

344
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,362
The back stairs on the first
floor and from the sky.

345
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,097
