00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,749
Thanks a whole lot
for the food, old guy.

178
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,686
[chewing] Good food. Want more.

179
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,689
That little bit
wasn't enough food...

180
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:14,861
‐‐[STOMACH grumbles]
‐‐[LUFFY sighs]

181
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,397
[LUFFY] Where's the city?
Where's a restaurant?

182
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,835
Can't a guy get any food in
this stupid desert place!

183
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,238
[sighs]

184
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,883
[gasps]

185
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,518
Food!

186
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,421
[LUFFY]
I'm coming, food!

187
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:51,264
[ONLOOKERS gossiping]

188
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,904
What's going on? What happened?

189
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,639
Well... someone died.

190
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,107
Apparently he suddenly
dropped dead

191
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,141
right in the middle
of the restaurant.

192
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,110
He just died?!

193
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,811
[ONLOOKER B] Yeah, he just
up and keeled over

194
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,114
during a conversation
with the owner.

195
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,315
[ONLOOKER C]
He isn't from here.

196
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,917
We think he may have
accidentally eaten a

197
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,385
Desert Strawberry
while traveling,

198
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,786
not knowing what it was.

199
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,289
[ONLOOKER A] Uh, what is
a Desert Strawberry?

200
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,257
[ ONLOOKER C] There's a
species of poisonous spiders

201
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,927
that look like red strawberries
growing in the desert.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,729
Anyone who eats one will
suddenly die a few days later.

203
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,332
The infection spreads throughout
the corpse, and it's contagious,

204
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
so no one can go near.

205
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,670
It's a quick but
unpleasant way to go.

206
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,240
[ONLOOKER B] You have to
be careful in the desert.

207
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,309
Anything you touch can kill you.

208
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,811
But just look at the way his
arm is still stuck up like that,

209
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,680
holding on to a bite of meat.

210
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,983
That's proof of just how swiftly
the Desert Strawberry acts.

211
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,319
It's an incredibly
deadly creature.

212
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:51,324
[ONLOOKERS whispering]

213
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:55,962
[ONLOOKERS scream]

214
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,197
[ONLOOKER A]
He came back to life!

215
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,808
[ACE]
Huh?

216
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,177
Um... are you all right?

217
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,513
‐‐[ONLOOKERS gasp]
‐‐[WOMAN screams]

218
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,815
[ACE sighs]

219
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,351
[ACE]
Sorry about that.

220
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,151
Fell asleep.

221
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,354
[ONLOOKERS]
You were asleep?!

222
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,855
That doesn't make sense!

223
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,024
You were right in the
middle of a conversation!

224
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,893
And now you're just eating
like nothing happened?!

225
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,297
Jeez, what's all the
commotion about, anyway?

226
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,033
[ONLOOKERS] We thought you had
dropped dead! Are you crazy?!

227
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,036
Does this restaurant of yours
do comedy skits or something?

228
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,839
Nope. That isn't
our thing, not here.

229
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,508
We're just glad that
you're all right.

230
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,810
[ONLOOKERS]
Damn it! Cut it out!

231
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,881
‐‐[ACE snores]
‐‐[ONLOOKERS chatter]

232
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,217
[ONLOOKER A] So it turns out
he wasn't dead after all?

233
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:56,222
[ONLOOKERS continue chattering]

234
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,725
[SMOKER]
Hm...

235
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,829
Yeah, I think that oughta do it.

236
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,231
Tell me, mister.

237
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,232
[OWNER]
What is it?

238
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,768
[ACE] Have you by any
chance seen this guy?

239
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,337
He's a pirate that
wears a straw hat.

240
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,405
[SMOKER]
You've got some nerve,

241
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,908
eating in the middle of
a public place like this.

242
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:20,179
Even for a Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

243
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:24,417
Hello Portgas D. Ace.

244
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,287
Huh? No way! Not the
Whitebeard Pirates?!

245
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,057
[ONLOOKER E] I knew I'd seen
that mark on his back before!

246
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,391
[ONLOOKER A]
You mean this weirdo is

247
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,959
one of the Whitebeard Pirates?

248
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,861
[ONLOOKER F] It's the mark
of the Whitebeard Pirates!

249
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,296
But what is he doing here?

250
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,231
[ONLOOKERS chatter]

251
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,566
[SMOKER]
I'm curious.

252
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,270
What's such a big shot pirate
doing in this country?

253
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,077
[ACE]
I'm looking for someone.

254
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,948
My little brother.

255
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:04,223
[LUFFY]
Give me food!

256
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,058
What's with this
weirdo city, anyway?

257
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,561
There's some strange non‐food
smell all over the place!

258
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,965
[gasps] There's one!
It's a restaurant!

259
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,582
[ACE] So... what do you
want from me now, Captain?

260
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,017
[SMOKER] I'd just like you
to come with me quietly.

261
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,154
No thanks, I think I'll pass.

262
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,324
Yeah... figured you'd say that.

263
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,925
[sighs]

264
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,094
[SMOKER] I'm here in
Alabasta trying to hunt down

265
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,996
another pirate at the moment.

266
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,098
To be honest, I have
no real interest in

267
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,633
capturing you right now.

268
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,468
[ACE]
Then just look the other way.

269
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,171
[SMOKER]
I'm afraid I can't do that.

270
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,547
Not as long as I'm a Marine,

271
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,950
and you're part of a
notorious pirate crew.

272
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,320
That's not much of
a reason, now is it.

273
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,523
How 'bout I give you one?

274
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,130
[LUFFY]
Give me food!

275
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,199
Gum‐Gum Rocket!

[laughs]

280
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,716
Woo food! Now I can eat!

281
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,552
Finally! I'm starving!

282
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,387
I thought I was gonna die!

283
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,721
Old guy, gimme food.

284
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,156
Hurry, come on.

285
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,428
Food, food, food, food!
Now, now, now!

286
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,078
[LUFFY]
Amazing!

287
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,215
This is seriously the
best food I've ever tasted!

288
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,417
Uh, yes... thanks a lot.

289
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,285
But you see, sir...

290
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,455
It's just... well...

291
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,724
...you might want to
start running now.

292
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,758
Why is that?

293
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,194
The guy you sent flying
through the wall just now,

294
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,063
do you have any idea who he is?

295
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,631
Who sent someone flying?

296
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,599
You did.

297
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,734
Really? Who was he?

298
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,638
[LUFFY]
So...

299
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,075
...what's with all these holes?

300
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,743
Kind of a weird
decoration, you know?

301
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,611
So why'd you do it?

302
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,779
[ONLOOKERS]
You're the one who did it!

303
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,948
I did? Really?

304
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,386
[ACE groans]
Damn it.

305
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,622
So what the hell was that?

306
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,326
[SMOKER groans]
What just happened?

307
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,128
[ACE]
This is ridiculous!

308
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,063
Just look at this place!

309
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,268
[ACE]
Eh‐‐ Oh, hi there.

Many apologies for
disturbing your meal.

00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,511
[ACE]
What kind of world‐class idiot

312
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,313
would do something like this?

313
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,515
[ONLOOKERS gasp, yell]

314
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,683

Straw Hat!

I've been looking
for you, Straw Hat.

324
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,771
I thought you'd be here.

325
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,340
Seems I was correct.

326
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,314
Would you quit eating!

327
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,321
[LUFFY]
Isn't he...

328
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,524
[SMOKER]
Straw Hat Luffy.

329
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,526
You're finally here.

330
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,194
I already told you that you

331
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,829
couldn't make it
to the Grand Line

332
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,633
without beating
me first, didn't I?

333
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,069
[LUFFY groans]

334
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,737
[LUFFY]
What's happening?!

335
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,572
[SMOKER]
I ate the Plume Plume Fruit,

336
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,876
so my body can be smoke
whenever I want.

337
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,714
Gum‐Gum Pistol!

338
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,881
[SMOKER]
Don't you see?

339
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,685
You've got to go through me
to get to the Grand Line.

340
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,387
I told you!

You're that smokey guy!

What're you doing in Alabasta?!

Thanks a lot for the meal.

Huh?

Stop, you!

Wait up Luffy! It's me!

00:16:55,614 --> 00:17:00,252
Hold on a second!
Hey! Come back, Luffy!

00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,055

This is bad!

My Gum‐Gum moves don't work
against this guy at all!

355

a run for it now!

Yes sir! Would you
like a cool towel?

00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,467
It's quite refreshing.

359
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,202
This desert kingdom
really is hot.

It's Straw Hat!

361
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,305

Gather the Marines at once!

[TASHIGI]
Right! Come on!

370
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,423
They must have
devil fruit powers.

00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,724
No way!

372
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,793
[TASHIGI]
The Straw Hat's crew is here.

373
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,494
That must mean...

Why did you come to
this island, Straw Hat?

380
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,680
What are you after?

381
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,848
[LUFFY]
What am I after?

382
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,285
I just came here to beat up
some guy named Crocodile!

[SMOKER]
Crocodile?

384

you and Crocodile connected?

Where could Luffy have gone?

He doesn't know
the island at all.

00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,310
[SANJI]
Seriously.

393
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,711
A crew shouldn't have
to work this hard to

394
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,646
keep track of their captain.

395
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,714
Oh, Nami!

396
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,216

This doesn't look good.

397
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,450
We could be in some
serious trouble

if we don't get
out of here soon.

[SANJI]
Trouble? Why's that?

400
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,388
'Cause the Marines are here.

00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,022
Marines?

402
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,657
And also some mystery man.

403
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,659
Let's just find Luffy
as fast as possible and

404
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,394

Yeah, and they're
excited about something.

I'm sure it's nothing.

They're probably
chasing some idiot pirate

While you may have the
power of smoke, mine is fire.

440
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,483
A fight between the two
us would be pointless.

441
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,319
It would probably go on forever.

All right, looks like
the mystery man

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,888
has Devil Fruit powers.

And why is he helping us?

a bit, Luffy.

Heh. Can't a guy help out

get that, Smoker.
