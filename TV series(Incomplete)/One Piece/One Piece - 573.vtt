WEBVTT

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.281
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.320
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.255
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.899
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.802
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:44.974
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:47.510
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:50.746
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.682
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.117
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:57.820
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:02.458
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:04.093
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:07.763
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:11.967
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.005
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:18.774
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:22.011
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:22.044 --> 00:03:25.548
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:28.217
who were looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.886
and instigated an all-out war.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.822
Luffy finally defeated Hordy,

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:34.890
the captain of the
New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:34.924 --> 00:03:36.959
thwarting their
plan for revenge.

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:38.260
[LUFFY]
There's the Sunny.

00:03:38.294 --> 00:03:40.162
[USOPP]
Yeah, I see Franky!

00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:42.565
He looks like he's
ready to set sail.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:46.669
I can't wait!

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:55.277
[LUFFY] "Finally Time to Go!
Goodbye, Fishman Island!"

00:03:57.012 --> 00:04:02.351
[CROWD chattering]

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:03.719
[CAMIE]
Madam Sharley?

00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.589
Luffy and his friends
are setting sail now.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.527
[SHARLEY] Oh? Perhaps
you should see them off.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.929
Sure thing!

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:17.299
[MERMAIDS] Wait up!
We wanna go say goodbye, too!

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.667
[SHARLEY]
Sorry,

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.704
but I need somebody to
stay here and run the café.

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:22.938
We'll have more tourists here

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.608
now that we're rid of
that despicable Hordy.

00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:27.376
So I need you girls
to keep this place

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.745
in tip-top shape for me, okay?

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.014
You got it, Madam Sharley.

00:04:32.047 --> 00:04:35.251
[MERMAIDS giggling]

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.720
[gasps]

00:04:39.422 --> 00:04:42.324
Ah, the crystal ball?

00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:45.227
Don't worry,
I'm through with that now.

00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.130
I don't need to look
into the future anymore.

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.435
[SHARLEY] After all,
Fishman Island being torn apart

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:54.570
by Straw Hat Luffy...

00:04:54.603 --> 00:04:58.707
Well, that's a future
I never wanted to see.

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:03.078
So, if my prediction turned out
to be incorrect this time,

00:05:03.112 --> 00:05:05.881
then nothing would
make me happier.

00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:08.217
[CAMIE] She knows her
visions are never wrong.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.020
She must be more
scared than anyone.

00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:14.089
And it may not
come true anytime soon.

00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:17.760
It could be tomorrow
or a year from now.

00:05:17.793 --> 00:05:20.763
So we don't know when
we can stop worrying.

00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:24.366
Look, Madam Sharley,
I know you're afraid,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.035
but Luffy-chin and the
others would never--

00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:26.769
Camie.

00:05:26.802 --> 00:05:28.604
[CAMIE gasps]

00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:30.172
I hope that you'll forgive me.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:32.975
I shouldn't have
suspected your friends.

00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:34.376
I see that now.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.280
So you'd like me to trust
the Straw Hat boy, then?

00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:41.951
[CAMIE gasps]
Um, uh-huh!

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:47.990
[CROWD chattering]

00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.463
Here you go. For your trip!

00:05:54.497 --> 00:05:56.232
Sweet, thanks, everybody!

00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:59.702
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]
Oh, Luffy.

00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:03.205
Do you really have to set
sail from here immediately?

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:06.175
I-I only just met you!

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.911
Stay with us at
least one more day.

00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:11.113
No, better yet, another week!

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:12.815
O-Or a year, perhaps?

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:14.884
Jeez, Weepyhoshi,
you haven't stopped crying

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.553
since the moment
we met, have you?

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:20.689
[SHIRAHOSHI] You're right,
I'm always a crybaby.

00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:24.760
I'm sorry, Luffy. [cries]

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:27.429
[SANJI gasps]

00:06:27.463 --> 00:06:30.666
Wow, I can't believe my fantasy
is finally coming true!

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.935
The beautiful Mermaid
Princess is in tears

00:06:32.968 --> 00:06:35.404
because she can't
bear to see me go!

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.439
[MERMAIDS]
Bye, Sanji!

00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:41.243
Forget the New World,
I'm happy right here!

00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:43.679
[laughs] I agree!

00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:45.447
In fact, our time
with these ladies

00:06:45.481 --> 00:06:49.351
has inspired me to
compose a new song!

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:53.722
♪ I met my girlfriend
at the Mermaid Café! ♪

00:06:53.756 --> 00:06:54.957
[SANJI]
Try not to cry,

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.361
I'll always have a place in
my heart for every one of you!

00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:00.930
[ZORO]
I like that idea.

00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:02.197
Maybe you should stay here.

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:05.301
I don't want to watch you
drown in your own nosebleeds.

00:07:05.334 --> 00:07:06.602
You're just jealous
'cause they're not

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.537
begging you to stay, ugly!

00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:11.206
Who are you calling ugly?!

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.241
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Your Majesty.

00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:14.043
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:07:14.076 --> 00:07:15.978
Should you tell
them or should I?

00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.748
It's only a matter of time until
the Tamate Box reaches her.

00:07:19.782 --> 00:07:21.417
They need to know.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.887
If Big Mom opens
the box, it'll explode!

00:07:27.856 --> 00:07:30.526
[NEPTUNE]
Yes, but look at them.

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:32.161
[gasps]

00:07:32.194 --> 00:07:35.364
[CHOPPER, USOPP crying]

00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:37.166
It's all over.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.635
We can't go to
the New World now.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.572
Big Mom's gonna murder us
the second we get there.

00:07:43.606 --> 00:07:45.140
Maybe if we start sending her

00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:48.043
every piece of treasure we
find for the rest of our lives,

00:07:48.077 --> 00:07:50.779
she might let it
slide just this once!

00:07:50.813 --> 00:07:53.449
[BOTH] If we tell them
they sent her a bomb,

00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:56.118
they'll lose their will to live!

00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:58.187
[NEPTUNE] Come to think of it,
Minister of the Right,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.656
those explosives
are ten years old.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.125
It's possible they're
no longer functional.

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:06.061
Oh, I admire your
positivity, Your Majesty!

00:08:06.095 --> 00:08:09.498
We do keep it rather humid in
the Ryugu Palace, after all.

00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.133
And who really knows if Big Mom

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:13.035
will open the box
herself, anyway?

00:08:13.068 --> 00:08:16.472
[BOTH] Right, then let's
just hope for the best!

00:08:16.505 --> 00:08:20.809
Do I want to know what you
two are whispering about?

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:24.880
[NAMI]
Hm?

00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:27.182
Uh, what's this?

00:08:27.216 --> 00:08:29.551
It's a Log Pose
for the New World.

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:31.453
I'd like you to
take it with you.

00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:34.156
It frightened me to think
that the one you'd be using

00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:36.191
had only a single needle!

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:38.027
Huh? What's up, Nami?

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.596
So you got a new Log Pose? Heh.

00:08:40.629 --> 00:08:43.165
Whoa. It looks pretty cool!

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:47.536
[NAMI] But why does it
have three needles?

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:48.904
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Well, take a look at

00:08:48.937 --> 00:08:50.172
the Log Pose on your wrist.

00:08:50.205 --> 00:08:51.607
Notice anything odd?

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.409
Huh? Uh...

00:08:53.442 --> 00:08:55.711
[gasps] It's still moving!

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.113
That's funny, I thought we
had stayed here long enough

00:08:58.147 --> 00:08:59.515
for it to stabilize.

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:01.083
Oh no, you did.

00:09:01.116 --> 00:09:04.219
Half a day is all you need,
but that's not the issue.

00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:05.854
For the first half
of your journey,

00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:08.457
the Log Pose was recording
the magnetic waves

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.958
of each destination,

00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:13.429
so you were able to navigate
between islands that way.

00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:15.631
However, the second
half of the Grand Line

00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.533
won't be so easy to predict.

00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:19.468
In addition to the
currents and the weather,

00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:21.837
some of the islands
tend to experience

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.606
changes in their
magnetic waves as well.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.741
Huh?

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.543
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
In fact, some islands have waves

00:09:27.576 --> 00:09:29.645
that disappear altogether.

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:30.779
Huh?

00:09:30.813 --> 00:09:32.781
Then how are we supposed
to find out where they are?

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:36.318
Well, you're sure to lose
your way with only one needle.

00:09:36.351 --> 00:09:40.489
But now, fortunately,
you'll have three of them.

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:43.325
[NAMI] Okay, so why is
one of the needles moving

00:09:43.358 --> 00:09:45.027
while the other two
are sitting still?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.262
Are you sure this thing works?

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:49.832
Each of the needles is
recording the magnetic waves

00:09:49.865 --> 00:09:52.034
from one of three
different islands.

00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:54.503
This way, you'll be able
to assess multiple paths

00:09:54.536 --> 00:09:55.938
and determine
which way to travel

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.807
based on your instincts
as a navigator.

00:09:58.841 --> 00:10:00.275
It's likely to make
the difference

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:02.678
between life and death for you.

00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:04.046
A skilled navigator will know

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.582
which direction is safest
by simply observing

00:10:06.615 --> 00:10:08.951
the slightest movement
of their needles.

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.152
There are no guarantees,

00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:13.756
but there is a good rule
of thumb you can follow.

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:17.526
Erratic movement
means more danger!

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:19.728
Changes in magnetic waves
are often caused

00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:22.297
by abnormalities on the island.

00:10:23.332 --> 00:10:25.300
[NAMI]
What? That's creepy!

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:27.703
I'd rather not know
that stuff, thank you!

00:10:27.736 --> 00:10:29.371
[CHOPPER]
I'm with you on this one!

00:10:29.404 --> 00:10:30.773
[USOPP] Me, too!
Why don't you go ahead and

00:10:30.806 --> 00:10:32.141
smash that thing now?

00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:33.375
But you mustn't!

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:36.879
Knowing where the danger is will
help you travel more safely!

00:10:38.213 --> 00:10:39.014
[gasps]

00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:41.316
Lemme see, Nami.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.184
[USOPP screams]

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:44.787
No! Luffy!

00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:48.624
[screaming]

00:10:48.657 --> 00:10:50.125
Middle's one's going crazy!

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:54.263
That must be where the
party is. I say we go there!

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:58.400
[USOPP gasps]
We're gonna die!

00:10:58.433 --> 00:11:01.436
[NAMI] Excuse me, but who's
the navigator around here?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.205
I don't try to do
your job, do I?

00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:04.573
So let me do mine!

00:11:04.606 --> 00:11:07.142
Yeah, well I'm the
captain, remember?

00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:08.811
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Uh, Captain Luffy?

00:11:08.844 --> 00:11:13.048
We like being alive,
so please listen to her, okay?

00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:14.183
[ROBIN chuckles]

00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:17.119
Don't be afraid, Nami,
I'll protect you!

00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:18.887
Aw, look at her,
she's so adorable...

00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:22.157
And now for the B-side!
I call it "Requiem for Us"!

00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:24.593
Yo! Are you ready?

00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:28.630
'Cause it's time to get this
show on the road, bro!

00:11:28.664 --> 00:11:31.266
[ALL]
Huh?

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.437
Den taught me how to bring
this baby back up to the top.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.839
Well, Luffy?

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:38.407
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.142
Right!

00:11:40.175 --> 00:11:42.978
Let's go!

00:11:44.446 --> 00:11:45.547
We'll miss you!

00:11:45.581 --> 00:11:47.149
See ya!

00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:48.383
[HACHI grunts]

00:11:48.417 --> 00:11:51.720
I'm gonna stay here and help
these folks rebuild the factory.

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.456
You sure you'll be all
right without a guide?

00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:56.458
Sure! It was fun
havin' you around,

00:11:56.491 --> 00:11:58.360
but I think we'll be okay!

00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:00.295
Oh, sure, screw it,
we don't need a guide!

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.296
I mean, what's the point?

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.831
Apparently, we're just
gonna waltz our way into

00:12:02.865 --> 00:12:04.566
the world of suffering
and death anyway!

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.869
Exactly! Why don't we
all just die right now

00:12:06.902 --> 00:12:08.637
and save ourselves
the trouble, huh?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.571
[ROBIN]
Oh, dear.

00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:12.841
[MERMAIDS]
Goodbye! Come back someday!

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:15.177
[SANJI]
You bet your sweet fins I will!

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.713
You ladies are all
I dream about!

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:19.114
So much for the All Blue.

00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:20.415
[SANJI growls]

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:24.453
You've done so much
to help our kingdom.

00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:25.988
We thank you.

00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:29.391
I pray that you will
arrive safely.

00:12:29.424 --> 00:12:31.493
Heh. Thanks.

00:12:31.526 --> 00:12:32.861
Just you wait!

00:12:32.895 --> 00:12:35.931
By next time... Whoo!

00:12:35.964 --> 00:12:38.333
We'll be way tougher!

00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:40.335
Even tougher than the
Great Knight Neptune,

00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:42.604
and we'll be commanding
the most powerful army

00:12:42.638 --> 00:12:45.507
under the sea-fa-
so-la-ti-dooooo!

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.210
[LUFFY laughs]
Sounds good!

00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:52.014
[NEPTUNE chuckles]

00:12:52.047 --> 00:12:54.950
Now, where's--

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:57.920
[LUFFY]
There he is!

00:12:59.388 --> 00:13:01.089
[LUFFY]
Jimbei!

00:13:24.713 --> 00:13:25.948
Ha.

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:33.422
[LUFFY] All right,
New World, here we come!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.032
It's time to set sail!

00:14:01.683 --> 00:14:03.852
[FISHMAN B]
Goodbye, Straw Hat!

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.021
[ALL]
Bye!

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:10.559
[CHOPPER]
Bye! See ya next time!

00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:14.429
Well, time's
a wastin'! [chuckles]

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.473
[FISHCHILDREN]
Goodbye! Thank you!

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:27.209
[FISHMAN C] Come back for
more candy and meat sometime!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.511
[FISHMAN D]
I like humans now!

00:14:29.544 --> 00:14:33.081
Oh, and robots
and raccoons, too!

00:14:33.115 --> 00:14:34.216
[laughs]

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.952
I'm a reindeer,
but I'll let that one go!

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:39.621
[BROOK]
Huh? Oh. Not me?

00:14:39.654 --> 00:14:43.492
Be careful! Come back anytime!

00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:46.762
Come back for more
takoyaki, okay?

00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:50.165
I love you! Every one of you!

00:14:50.198 --> 00:14:51.600
[chuckles]

00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:55.804
[ALL]
Ready? Skeletons, too!

00:14:55.837 --> 00:14:58.840
[BROOK gasps]
You did remember!

00:14:58.874 --> 00:15:02.277
[crying]

00:15:16.758 --> 00:15:18.427
Majesty!

00:15:20.595 --> 00:15:21.830
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:21.863 --> 00:15:23.432
Luffy, wait!

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.100
[LUFFY]
Heh, whoa!

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:27.269
[SANJI]
Shirahoshi, my love!

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:31.373
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:15:33.608 --> 00:15:36.011
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I just wanted to say,

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:38.380
if I get to see you again...

00:15:40.115 --> 00:15:42.217
...then I promise you.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.518
I won't cry!

00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:46.455
At least, not as much as now.

00:15:48.223 --> 00:15:52.060
I hope you and I can take
another stroll together, Luffy.

00:15:52.094 --> 00:15:53.562
Oh, yeah?

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:56.598
You wanna go back to
your mom's grave again?

00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:58.967
No, not this time.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.070
The place I want to
go is farther away.

00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:07.375
[SHIRAHOSHI] I want to visit
a real forest, on the surface!

00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:10.011
[LUFFY]
That's right, you've never been

00:16:10.045 --> 00:16:12.614
out of the sea before, have you?

00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:15.851
Sure. Let's do it!

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:19.454
I'll take you there
first chance I get!

00:16:19.488 --> 00:16:22.090
[giggles]

00:16:22.124 --> 00:16:26.995
[ALL chuckle]

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.034
Promise me?

00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:36.705
Uh--okay, I'll pinky-swear ya!

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:39.174
Leave it to me!

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.342
Careful now, Luffy.

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:43.111
If you make a promise,
we have to help you keep it.

00:16:43.145 --> 00:16:45.247
Remember. No matter
what happens,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.949
you must never break
a promise, ever!

00:16:47.983 --> 00:16:50.619
[NAMI] You know what,
though? Count me in!

00:16:50.652 --> 00:16:54.089
[gasps] Oh, Nami!

00:16:54.122 --> 00:16:55.390
[SANJI]
And me, of course!

00:16:55.423 --> 00:16:56.992
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, me, too!

00:16:57.025 --> 00:16:58.226
[ROBIN]
And me.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.327
[BROOK]
Me, too.

00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:01.530
[USOPP]
Don't forget me!

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:03.465
We've all given our word now.

00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:06.935
No bones about that! [laughs]

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:09.871
[chuckles]

00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:12.007
[ALL]
We won't let you down!

00:17:14.776 --> 00:17:17.679
Oh, thank you!

00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:21.349
[LUFFY chuckles]
So don't cry anymore, okay?

00:17:25.687 --> 00:17:26.955
Right!

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:39.634
[SHIRAHOSHI giggles]

00:18:11.766 --> 00:18:14.970
[NEPTUNE] Never forget
what they've done for us.

00:18:15.003 --> 00:18:16.771
[PRINCES]
We won't, Father!

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.418
[FISHBOY C]
Hey, Papa!

00:18:30.452 --> 00:18:32.220
[FISHDAD A]
Huh?

00:18:32.254 --> 00:18:35.123
Can you pretty please
buy me a straw hat, too?

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.626
I wanna be just like Luffy!

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:38.893
Huh?

00:18:38.927 --> 00:18:41.696
I'm sorry, buddy, but they don't
sell straw hats on the seafloor.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.598
Then go get one from up there!

00:18:43.632 --> 00:18:45.433
[gasps] I can't do that, son.

00:18:45.467 --> 00:18:47.736
The surface is full of
humans who hate our kind!

00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:49.471
There's no telling
what they'll do if I--

00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:50.438
Huh?

00:18:50.472 --> 00:18:52.207
Er--uh, what I mean is,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.443
I've heard that some humans
aren't very nice, that's all.

00:18:55.477 --> 00:18:56.945
But they're not all the same.

00:18:56.978 --> 00:18:59.914
Some of them are heroes,
like Straw Hat Luffy!

00:18:59.948 --> 00:19:01.249
[FISHDAD A, FISHBOY C]
Huh?

00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:06.755
[FISHDAD A] Hey, Boss
Jimbei! Perfect timing!

00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:10.425
I just overheard.

00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:12.694
I'm going to ask a merchant
to get his hands on

00:19:12.727 --> 00:19:14.796
some of those straw hats for us.

00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:15.964
[FISHBOY C]
Really?

00:19:15.997 --> 00:19:17.832
Yes, my boy.

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:20.769
You'd like to be
a hero, wouldn't you?

00:19:20.802 --> 00:19:22.137
Uh-huh!

00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:24.272
[chuckles]

00:19:24.306 --> 00:19:31.012
[JIMBEI laughing]

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:47.796
[sighs] I miss it already!

00:19:47.829 --> 00:19:51.132
All those gorgeous mermaids.

00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:53.802
[NAMI] Look alive,
you guys. Don't goof off.

00:19:53.835 --> 00:19:57.472
Once we ascend, who knows what
trouble we might run into!

00:19:57.505 --> 00:20:00.408
You remember how scary it was
on the way down, don't you?

00:20:00.442 --> 00:20:03.611
[FRANKY grunting]

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.683
Huh? What's with the
weird boxes, Franky?

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:11.319
[FRANKY] Those are hollow
cubes made out of banyan.

00:20:11.353 --> 00:20:12.987
They're gonna help us float.

00:20:14.122 --> 00:20:18.126
I can even adjust the ship's
speed based on how many I throw.

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:24.265
[ZORO]
Hm? Luffy, what's up?

00:20:32.374 --> 00:20:34.843
Once we reach the New World...

00:20:37.045 --> 00:20:39.481
...Shanks won't be far away.

00:20:44.886 --> 00:20:47.756
I hope I see him soon!

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:49.591
[SHANKS]
In that case,

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:52.660
I'll leave this hat to you.

00:20:52.694 --> 00:20:55.530
It means more to me
than anything else.

00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:58.166
I want you to bring
this hat back to me.

00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:01.069
But not until you've
become a great pirate.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:10.478
There is one thing that hurts.

00:21:10.512 --> 00:21:15.517
I won't be around...
to see you fulfill your dream.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.221
It's fine. I have
faith you can do it.

00:21:21.356 --> 00:21:23.658
'Cause you're my brother.

00:21:23.691 --> 00:21:26.561
[JIMBEI] There is yet
joy beyond your sorrow!

00:21:26.594 --> 00:21:28.863
What's gone may be gone,

00:21:28.897 --> 00:21:30.799
but you still have something
left in this world

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:33.101
to treasure, don't you?

00:21:33.134 --> 00:21:36.137
Let nothing stop you
from reaching the top!

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:39.207
By the way, I was wondering
if you've ever heard

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.444
the name they use for the
second half of the Grand Line?

00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.281
[COBY] On the other
side of the Red Line,

00:21:46.314 --> 00:21:48.416
at the far reaches of the ocean,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.886
is a place that few pirates
or marines have ever seen.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.621
They call it...

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:55.590
...the New World.

00:21:56.658 --> 00:21:58.560
The New World.

00:22:01.262 --> 00:22:03.097
[COBY]
There's a new era coming,

00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:06.534
and the people who can guide it
are gathering on those seas.

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:08.970
They say the one who
can master those waters

00:22:09.003 --> 00:22:11.706
will become King of Pirates!

00:22:13.842 --> 00:22:16.744
[LUFFY] Who knows what's
waiting for us up there.

00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:20.281
That's the greatest
sea in the world!

00:22:20.315 --> 00:22:21.783
Took long enough.

00:22:21.816 --> 00:22:23.284
I'm ready for some action!

00:22:23.318 --> 00:22:25.386
It won't be long now, Laboon!

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.921
Just one half to go!

00:22:26.955 --> 00:22:29.657
With this new Log Pose,
I can take us anywhere!

00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:32.260
And wherever we go,
the Sunny can handle it!

00:22:32.293 --> 00:22:34.896
Don't worry, I'll treat
all your injuries!

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:37.932
And as long as I'm around,
you'll never go hungry.

00:22:37.966 --> 00:22:40.301
The great Usopp's
got your back, too!

00:22:40.335 --> 00:22:42.470
[ROBIN laughs]

00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:44.305
[chuckles]

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.910
All right!

00:22:48.943 --> 00:22:51.913
Let's go!

00:23:02.724 --> 00:23:04.759
[LUFFY]
The New World's waiting!

00:23:04.792 --> 00:23:07.262
[STRAW HATS]
Yeah!

00:23:10.899 --> 00:23:12.834
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
depart from Fishman Island

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:14.435
and ascend to the surface.

00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:16.271
The journey is not
a short one, however,

00:23:16.304 --> 00:23:17.872
and it is filled
with sea monsters

00:23:17.906 --> 00:23:19.908
of increasingly massive size.

00:23:19.941 --> 00:23:21.476
While Luffy tries to
make dinner out of

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:23.077
the underwater abominations,

00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.680
the Sunny encounters
a deadly whirlpool.

00:23:25.713 --> 00:23:27.649
Helpless against
its whipping waters,

00:23:27.682 --> 00:23:30.451
the crew must hope for
a miracle to survive.

00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:32.053
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.086 --> 00:23:35.490
"To the New World!
Heading for the Ultimate Sea!"

00:23:35.523 --> 00:23:38.259
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
