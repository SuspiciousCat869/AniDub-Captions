This cheap swill makes
me feel terrible.

Ah, man.

00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,596
How I long for the old days
when I was surrounded by

changed the course
of my entire life.

00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,647
Because of him,
the Marines said I

183
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,816
tarnished their good name
and I lost my rank

184

of Marine Headquarters

him will be easy!

restore me to full rank.

at the sea restaurant.

came outta battle.

at us! This is bad!

We're getting closer.

351
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,763
We've almost made it to
the Grand Line and...

352
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,366
It looks like the only
way into it is here,

353
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,301
through Reverse Mountain.

354
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,702
What a pain.

355
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,272
There's gotta be some
way around that thing.

356
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,475
There's not. From what
the geezer told me

357
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,543
that's the only place to enter.

Hm?

Well how come?

360
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,381
'Cause it's really dangerous.

361
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,682
Yeah... but how come?!

362

I told you everything
I know... Jeez!

See the reason is‐‐

364
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,190
Hey! I got an idea! Why don't
we just sail straight into it!

365
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,493
Are you really that clueless?!

366
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:38,230
My way sounds a lot funner!
Plus, it'd feel way better

367
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,299
to just dive right
into it, you know?

drives me completely insane.

370
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,540
First off, we need to
stop at an island...

371
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:52,577
Time to pick up some meat!
We need meat!

372
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,179
Mm?

373
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,415
[NAMI] There's a famous
city on this island.

374
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,250
Known as Loguetown.

375
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,651
Loguetown...

376
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,221
Why is it famous?
They got delicious meat?

377
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,158
I'm pretty sure I've
heard of it before.

378
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,694
It's the city of the
beginning and the end.

[LUFFY]
Mm?

380
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,398
It's the town where the old King
of the Pirates, Gold Roger,

381
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,234
was both born and killed.

382
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,408
That's where the King
of the Pirates died?

383
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,710
Well?

384
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,745
Yeah. Let's do it...

385
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,381
This was the man who
had the One Piece.

Everything the world
has to offer.
