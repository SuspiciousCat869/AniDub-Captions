00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:37.481
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.665
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.236
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.442
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:53.380
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.658
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.832
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:04.368
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:08.376
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.752
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:16.325
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.196
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.367
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.772
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.879
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:29.151
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:32.091
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.563
Years in the past,
Corazon spent six months

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:36.232
taking Law to various hospitals,

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.405
in order to cure his deadly
White Lead Disease.

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:44.348
What are you gonna do to me?

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:48.022
[ROSINANTE] You're still
a pain in the ass kid,

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:50.829
but hearing you
talk about death...

00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:53.700
My heart can't take it.

00:03:55.838 --> 00:04:00.413
[ROSINANTE] You may have stabbed
me, you little shit. But...

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:05.558
It didn't hurt at all.

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.700
You were the one who was
actually suffering back then.

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:13.574
I just wanted to fix
things for you, Law.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:17.247
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
This is it!

00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:21.022
Playtime's over.
Fun while it lasted.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:23.359
[BELLAMY yells]

00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:25.664
See you in hell!

00:04:37.254 --> 00:04:39.659
[BELLAMY yelling]

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.667
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:48.075
[yells]

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.618
[groans]

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:58.864
Wasn't enough.

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:02.939
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
My string's stronger than that.

00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:05.845
Traffy!

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:08.416
I can't get stuck
here fighting you.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.920
This is no good.

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.990
[DOFLAMINGO]
Yeah? What're you gonna do?

00:05:12.023 --> 00:05:16.867
If a sword won't cut your
string, then how about this?

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.471
Hm?

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:26.653
[yells]

00:05:31.428 --> 00:05:34.034
Now it's time for a comeback!

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:48.096
[panting]

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.603
[laughs]

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:03.293
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:06.633
[LAW]
Hey, Cora! Cora!

00:06:08.537 --> 00:06:10.140
Ooh, that's nice.

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:11.475
Call me "Cora" again.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:12.679
Don't be weird!

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:15.383
[ROSINANTE giggles]
Are you shy?

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:19.192
Just pick up the
damn snail already!

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:20.795
Cu-lick.

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:23.634
Corazon. It's me.

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.516
What's wrong?

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.720
I know you're there.

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:44.308
[DOFLAMINGO]
It's already been six months

00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.580
since you took off on your own.

00:06:46.613 --> 00:06:48.850
Is Law still with you?

00:06:50.287 --> 00:06:52.090
[LAW]
Doflamingo.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.081
[DOFLAMINGO] I see. Well, I'm
glad both of you are all right.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:06.452
Have you found a good doctor?

00:07:06.486 --> 00:07:08.557
[tapping]

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.895
[DOFLAMINGO]
I had a feeling.

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:14.068
I think it's time you
come back to the ship.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.873
We might be able to
cure Law's disease.

00:07:16.907 --> 00:07:18.042
Huh?

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:23.086
[DOFLAMINGO] I happened to find
a lead on the Op-Op Fruit.

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:24.622
[gasps]

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.627
[DOFLAMINGO] Some stupid pirates
who don't know what it's worth

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.296
got their hands on it.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.666
Seems the Navy caught word,

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.637
'cause now they're
offering them a ton of money

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.474
and getting ready for trade.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.914
As usual, the World Government

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:39.619
is pulling strings
to get their way.

00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:42.825
It's risky, but we can steal it.

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:48.369
[DOFLAMINGO] Once we have it,
due to the nature of its power,

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.608
I can only allow
someone whose loyalty

00:07:50.641 --> 00:07:53.747
I trust completely to eat it.

00:07:55.383 --> 00:07:58.958
[DOFLAMINGO]
And that would be you, Corazon.

00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:02.998
Afterwards, you can
cure Law's disease.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.476
Cu-lick.

00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:12.719
[DOFLAMINGO] What do you think?
I value your opinion.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:13.988
The Navy had been hounding us

00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.027
everywhere we went,
quite consistently.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.535
Tsuru in particular
always seemed to find us.

00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:22.003
But in the past six months,

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:25.845
the Navy hasn't reared its
ugly head around us even once.

00:08:25.878 --> 00:08:29.753
You'll note, that's exactly
how long Corazon's been gone.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.689
You think your dear
little brother has been

00:08:31.723 --> 00:08:34.763
tipping off the Navy
this whole time?

00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:39.539
[laughs] Could be a
coincidence, though!

00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:42.745
That's certainly
what I'm hoping.

00:08:42.778 --> 00:08:46.185
I don't want to
distrust him, honestly.

00:08:46.218 --> 00:08:49.091
We're still family, after all.

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:53.299
Lucky you, Law!

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.970
[ROSINANTE laughs]

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:56.573
[ROSINANTE]
Forget those stupid doctors!

00:08:56.607 --> 00:08:58.310
You're gonna
make it without them!

00:08:58.343 --> 00:08:59.679
Once we get the Op-Op Fruit,

00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:03.486
your White Lead Disease
will be a thing of the past!

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:04.889
What's the Op-Op Fruit do?

00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:07.327
It lets you modify
someone's body!

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.898
You can perform
miracle operations

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:11.870
and cure any nasty diseases!

00:09:11.903 --> 00:09:12.672
Yeah right.

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:14.408
I don't believe in fairy tales.

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:16.813
It's real! But there's a catch!

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:19.553
You need knowledge to use it!

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:21.256
[LAW gasps]

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:22.691
But that's no problem.

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.096
'Cause I know you're the
son of a brilliant doctor--

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.504
one who was trusted by
the people of Flevance.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:30.741
And soon as you were
old enough to learn,

00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:33.580
you started picking up every
ounce of medical know-how

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:35.785
you could from him, right?

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:40.528
I mean, yeah, but why's
that matter now?

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:42.097
Are you kidding?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.467
It matters 'cause
you're gonna eat the fruit!

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:48.910
I am? Doflamingo said you were
s'posed to eat it, though!

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.524
A person will die if
he eats two Devil Fruits.

00:09:55.557 --> 00:09:57.494
Doffy only said that
'cause he doesn't know

00:09:57.528 --> 00:10:00.399
about my Calm-Calm
Fruit ability.

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.773
We're through with Doffy.

00:10:03.807 --> 00:10:05.978
We aren't going back
to the Family.

00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:07.046
[gasps]

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.770
That decision became clear to me

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:21.409
as my journey
with you dragged on.

00:10:22.377 --> 00:10:27.387
By now, I'm sure Doffy has
realized that I'm a traitor.

00:10:28.156 --> 00:10:32.297
You sure? On the snail, he said
you should eat the fruit, right?

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:35.738
There is a secondary reason
behind that decision.

00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:38.677
It has nothing to do with trust.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:43.085
[ROSINANTE]
I get it, Doffy.

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:46.459
You want me to sacrifice myself
to give you eternal life.

00:10:46.492 --> 00:10:48.563
And if I don't, I'm a traitor.

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:51.135
But either way, I'm dead.

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:54.008
Listen, we'll get
the jump on Doffy!

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:58.584
We'll steal the Op-Op Fruit
before anybody else can have it!

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:00.988
You'll eat the fruit
and cure your illness.

00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:04.261
When you're better, we can go
into hiding somewhere together.

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:06.265
[gasps]

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:09.104
[ROSINANTE]
Prepare to set sail.

00:11:09.138 --> 00:11:12.277
We'll get that fruit,
no matter what it takes.

I've been worried about you!

Hey, Garp! Could you
step out for a second?

Yeah, sorry. Go ahead.

00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:57.467
[ROSINANTE] I heard you were
looking to make a trade

00:11:57.502 --> 00:11:59.337
for the Op-Op Fruit.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:06.318
[SENGOKU]
Yes, but how did you know that?

00:12:06.352 --> 00:12:08.757
My brother caught
wind of it somehow.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.132
What? That's top secret info!

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:16.372
[LAW] I see. So that's who
you're talking to, huh?

00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:19.646
Where can I find the pirates
you're making the trade with?

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.981
[SENGOKU]
I don't know.

00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:23.252
If they're smart,
they're laying low right now.

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:25.757
And what if I told
you that Doflamingo

00:12:25.791 --> 00:12:28.864
was going to steal the fruit
before you could buy it?

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:30.333
[SENGOKU]
Is he?

00:12:30.367 --> 00:12:32.036
[LAW]
Weird...

00:12:32.938 --> 00:12:35.678
[LAW]
I'm dizzy all of a sudden.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.349
When and where are you
making the trade?

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:42.423
[SENGOKU] Three weeks from now
at Rubeck in the North Blue.

[ROSINANTE]
Rubeck.

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:47.467
I'll meet Doffy and his
friends on Swallow Island.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.142
They should be there three days
before the handoff happens.

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:52.945
[SENGOKU]
That's where he'll be waiting?

00:12:52.978 --> 00:12:54.949
I imagine he won't want
to take any chances,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.989
so he'll likely bring
the entire Family with him.

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:00.026
Thanks for the intel.

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:02.598
So we'll plan an ambush
at Swallow Island.

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:04.835
That'll be the end
of Doflamingo!

00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:07.474
It's a chance to catch
the whole Don Quixote Family

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:08.877
in one fell swoop!

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.084
Just make sure you stay away!

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:14.054
[ROSINANTE]
That was the plan.

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:15.825
I've got a list I'll
be sending your way

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:19.699
soon as I can of Doffy's
business partners.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.504
Big shots working
behind the scenes.

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:27.915
Buncha dark little secrets
hiding there in the North Blue.

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.053
[SENGOKU]
I see. Thank you.

00:13:30.086 --> 00:13:32.423
Cu-lick.

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:33.325
Hey, Law.

00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:36.900
You ready to
take off? Gotta move.

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:39.840
Law! Are you okay?

00:13:39.873 --> 00:13:42.745
C'mon kid, stay with me!

00:13:43.479 --> 00:13:46.819
Not now, when we finally have
a real chance to save you!

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:48.890
It hasn't even been
three years yet!

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:50.460
You said you had
more time than this!

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:51.796
You gotta hang in there!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.334
Aw jeez, that fever's bad!

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:55.604
What should I do?

00:13:55.638 --> 00:13:58.142
Doctors are useless. It's all
up to me now to save him.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:01.148
I'll give him some water.
That's something, at least!

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:08.162
[screams]

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.805
[ROSINANTE] Dammit! What am I
supposed to do, Law?

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:15.176
Gimme a hint, please!

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:20.086
You gotta pull
through this, okay?

00:14:23.226 --> 00:14:26.364
[ROSINANTE] Just stay alive
for three more weeks!

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.872
Give me a chance
to make this right!

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:38.590
[ROSINANTE] Damn it!
Why did a storm have to hit now?

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:39.859
[LAW]
Cora...

00:14:39.893 --> 00:14:42.497
[ROSINANTE]
Huh? What's wrong, Law?

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:44.201
All those years...

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.640
The Government knew that
my people would die,

00:14:46.673 --> 00:14:51.148
but they kept making us dig up
that White Lead to get rich.

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:56.092
The people of Flevance,
and my family.

00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:59.497
The Government killed them!

00:15:02.337 --> 00:15:03.540
Tell me the truth.

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:06.345
Are you one of them?
Working with the Navy?

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.950
Are you a Marine,
like the others?

00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:10.086
You kidding me?

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.991
No, I could never be a Marine!

00:15:15.029 --> 00:15:16.633
What a relief!

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.169
I'm with you, Law.

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:19.939
But listen to me, okay?

00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:22.945
Once you and I run away
with the Op-Op Fruit,

00:15:22.978 --> 00:15:24.414
we'll make enemies of everyone!

00:15:24.447 --> 00:15:27.688
Doflamingo, the Navy,
and the World Government!

00:15:27.721 --> 00:15:30.392
And they'll chase us to the
end of world if they have to!

00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:35.236
So, if you wanna live,
be prepared to fight for it!

00:15:58.215 --> 00:15:59.552
[ROSINANTE]
Any update on the location of

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.188
those pirates, Sengoku?

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:03.292
[SENGOKU] Yeah, they're
hiding in a ghost town

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:06.031
in this place
called Minion Island.

00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:07.701
It's right to the
east of Rubeck,

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:09.137
where we're making the trade.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.143
Seems like they have
a hideout over there.

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:15.651
[SENGOKU] The pirate's
name is Diez Barrels.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.353
That ring a bell?

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:20.159
[ROSINANTE] Yeah, he's a
former Navy officer, right?

00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:21.829
[SENGOKU]
Good memory.

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:23.867
Anyway, our lookout
ship is monitoring

00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:26.438
Minion Island as we speak.

00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:32.585
[ROSINANTE] Everything he
said seems to check out.

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:35.323
[SENGOKU] We have everything
set up at Swallow Island, too,

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:38.029
near where you told Doflamingo
you were going to meet him.

00:16:38.062 --> 00:16:40.032
We brought two warships
to deal with him.

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:43.038
We're ready for
an all-out battle.

00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:44.542
[ROSINANTE] I don't think
anyone should be able to

00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:46.713
see our boat down here.

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:48.950
[SENGOKU] I won't let Doflamingo
get his grubby fingers

00:16:48.983 --> 00:16:51.890
on the Op-Op Fruit,
no matter what it takes.

00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:54.962
Okay. It won't be long now, Law.

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:56.532
Wait here.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.145
[BARRELS PIRATES chattering]

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:24.421
[BARRELS PIRATE A] Drie! Where's
my booze? I need a refill!

00:17:24.454 --> 00:17:25.691
Right away.

00:17:25.724 --> 00:17:27.628
All this money for one fruit!

00:17:27.661 --> 00:17:30.299
Do you know how much
they offered us, huh?

00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:34.609
Five billion berries,
man! [laughs]

00:17:34.642 --> 00:17:36.112
What a buncha suckers!

00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:38.382
Is the Government
full of morons or what?

00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:39.619
If we get that much money,

00:17:39.652 --> 00:17:41.388
we don't even need to
be pirates anymore.

00:17:41.422 --> 00:17:43.761
We can just stuff
our faces and party!

00:17:43.794 --> 00:17:44.962
[BARRELS PIRATES laugh]

00:17:44.996 --> 00:17:48.469
[laughs] Yeah, that
sounds good to me!

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:51.342
From what I understand
about this thing,

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:54.715
if a doctor gobbles it up,
then he'll get the skills

00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:58.455
to be a world-famous surgeon,
like none other.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.796
[BARRELS]
There was some legendary doctor

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.332
who ate it some time ago.

00:18:03.365 --> 00:18:06.104
They say he could perform
miracles with a scalpel.

00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:09.311
Cure incurable diseases.
That sort of thing.

00:18:09.344 --> 00:18:11.749
But what the hell do I care?

00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:13.386
I don't need to be a surgeon!

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:14.756
[BARRELS PIRATE A]
Not when you're as rich

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:15.824
as we're gonna be!

00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:17.360
[BARRELS PIRATE B]
Damn straight!

00:18:40.607 --> 00:18:42.611
[ROSINANTE]
Check this out, Law.

00:18:42.644 --> 00:18:46.719
Everything that's near me won't
make a peep after I do this!

00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:50.627
Calm!

00:18:58.209 --> 00:19:00.179
[LAW]
That face!

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:06.859
[LAW]
That stare!

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:10.767
[LAW]
Ugh! That stinks!

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.969
Just like magic!

00:19:12.002 --> 00:19:13.272
You didn't hear
a thing, did you?

00:19:13.306 --> 00:19:16.412
Who cares? What the hell
is that even good for?

00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:17.347
[ROSINANTE]
U-Uh--

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.552
[LAW]
It's totally dumb!

00:19:19.586 --> 00:19:22.991
Baby 5's Arms-Arms
power is way cooler!

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:24.227
Yeah, you're right!

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.400
I totally wish I could
do that stuff, too!

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:29.572
But when it comes to having
a peaceful night's sleep,

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:30.707
no one beats me.

00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:32.744
[LAW]
So what?

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:50.981
[BARRELS PIRATES gasp]

00:19:51.014 --> 00:19:53.520
What happened? An earthquake?

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:55.824
Captain! I didn't
hear an explosion,

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.327
but something blew up!

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.264
The compound's on fire!

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.605
[BARRELS] What?! Was there
an explosion or not?

00:20:02.638 --> 00:20:04.441
[BARRELS PIRATE E gasps]
Our treasure!

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:05.911
Our treasure's burning!

00:20:05.944 --> 00:20:10.553
Then put out the fire already!
What's going on here?

00:20:12.557 --> 00:20:15.897
[BARRELS] We must be
under attack somehow!

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:17.500
[BARRELS PIRATE A]
The lights just went out.

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:19.404
[BARRELS PIRATE F] Where's all
this glass coming from?

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:22.477
[BARRELS PIRATE A] The lamps!
They were all shattered!

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:25.683
[BARRELS] Somebody!
Light a candle, would you?

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.228
C'mon, doesn't anybody
have a light?

00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:38.442
[BARRELS PIRATES chattering]

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:41.916
Somebody's in here!

00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:54.842
[BARRELS PIRATES scream]

00:20:59.786 --> 00:21:02.624
[BARRELS PIRATE J]
Hm? Who is that guy?

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:13.546
[ROSINANTE] I got it, Law!
Just like I said I would!

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:16.952
We're gonna cure that
disease of yours right up!

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.649
[gasps]

00:21:33.787 --> 00:21:35.890
[screams]

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.437
That freaked me out! Who's that?

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.073
[BARRELS PIRATE L]
He fell outta nowhere!

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:47.180
[BARRELS PIRATE M] Hey! A guy
in a black coat just stole

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:49.652
the Op-Op Fruit and
he was coming this way!

00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:52.023
[BARRELS PIRATE J]
Don't let him escape!

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:54.161
He said "a guy in a black coat"?

00:21:54.194 --> 00:21:55.530
[BARRELS PIRATE N gasps]

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:58.569
[BARRELS PIRATES]
It's him!

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:06.017
[gunshots]

00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:13.566
[ROSINANTE]
Law, I can't take you with me

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:16.070
for the last part of this plan.

00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:24.821
I know you've got it rough,
but wait for me here, okay?

00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:30.399
I'll be back.

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.739
And I'll have the
Op-Op Fruit with me, too!

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:16.792
[NARRATOR] Corazon made off
with the Op-Op Fruit,

00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:18.395
but by the time he reaches Law,

00:23:18.428 --> 00:23:21.835
the injuries he sustained
threaten to do him in.

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.575
Law searches for help
and encounters a Marine,

00:23:24.608 --> 00:23:27.113
but a cruel twist of fate
causes things to quickly

00:23:27.146 --> 00:23:29.818
go from bad to
worse for Corazon.

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:31.589
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:35.630
"The Moment of Resolution!
Corazon's Farewell Smile!"

00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:38.636
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
