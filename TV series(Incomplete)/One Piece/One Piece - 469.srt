1
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,224
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,961
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,264
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,067
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,870
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,538
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,507
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,377
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,013
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,547
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,717
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,187
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:10,624
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,794
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:18,398
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,037
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,306
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

18
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,174
to rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,109
The Whitebeard Pirates
have successfully

20
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,678
pushed into the bay,
but a massive number of Marines

21
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,849
still block the path to Ace.
The battle is heating up!

22
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,619
[MARINE N yelling]

23
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,154
[LUFFY grunts]

24
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,024
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

25
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,728
[ACE]
Why do any of them care?

26
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,063
I deserve to die like this.

27
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,534
Why can't they see I'm not
worth risking their lives for?

28
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,769
Please don't do this.

29
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,640
Just stop! Just let me die
like I'm supposed to!

30
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,377
Ace! You're my brother!

31
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:05,379
[PRISONERS shouting]

32
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,081
[IVANKOV]
Please listen! That's enough!

33
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,451
Kuma! Look, it's me!

34
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,586
Have you forgotten my face?

35
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,623
If you don't stop, friendship
be damned! I will fight back!

36
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,626
[DOFLAMINGO laughs] I don't
know what kind of a history

37
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,995
you two have,
but it doesn't matter.

38
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,097
Trust me, Emporio Ivankov.

39
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,400
There's really no use in
talking to him as he is now!

40
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,804
Doflamingo...
What're you saying?

41
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,205
Is something wrong with him?

42
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,074
[DOFLAMINGO] You're clearly
a friend of Bartholomew Kuma's,

43
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,409
so I doubt you'll
take this well.

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,645
The man you knew
as "The Tyrant Kuma"

45
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,815
is not the man you
see before you now.

46
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,919
Because that man is dead.

47
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,920
Hate to tell you though,

48
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,090
you're still not strong
enough to beat me.

49
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,291
Dammit! Ya cheap jerk!

50
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,293
Move that thing!

51
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,627
[HANCOCK]
Get your filthy hands off him!

52
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,162
[SMOKER groans]

53
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,165
My body's smoke.
How'd she hit me?

54
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,266
[MARINE JJ]
Wait a sec!

55
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,669
Why did the Pirate Empress
just save Straw Hat?

56
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:05,672
Hey, Hancock! What the
hell's wrong with you?

57
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,407
Don't tell me you're
resigning from the Warlords?

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,076
Shut your mouth!

59
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,677
The screaming fury in my heart

60
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,679
has rendered me
deaf to your words!

61
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,515
How dare you pin
my beloved down

62
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,484
with your boorish club
and threaten him?

63
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,687
You will die for your actions.

64
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,057
I've never felt this angry
in my entire life!

65
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,427
I'll feed you piece by
piece to wild animals!

66
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,730
Hah. The Kuja's Haki
is overwhelming.

67
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,344
[MARINES gasping]

68
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,180
[MARINE AA]
What the hell just happened?

69
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:50,717
I thought Hancock was
supposed to be on our side!

70
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,777
No! Look!

71
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,178
She's not saving him.

72
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,315
She's about to turn
Straw Hat into stone!

73
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,749
[HANCOCK]
I never stopped believing that

74
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,686
you'd make it here alive,
and now, here you are.

75
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,993
[HANCOCK]
Take this.

76
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,331
[HANCOCK] It's the key
to your brother's handcuffs.

77
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,532
[gasps]

78
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,468
[MARINE BB] Wow, she's really
doin' a number on him!

79
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,069
[MARINE CC]
Straw Hat's frozen in place,

80
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,603
he hasn't moved an inch!

81
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,539
Did she turn him to stone?

82
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,808
Thanks, Hancock!

83
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,978
[gasps] He said my name!

84
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,480
[HANCOCK gasping]

85
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:00,921
The touch of his hands...
They're strong, yet so kind!

86
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,889
[LUFFY]
Hancock.

87
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,393
Yay! You're so awesome!
I could hug ya forever!

88
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,295
I'll never forget this,
what a pal!

89
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,364

92
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,941
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

93
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,877
Oh, um, well...
it's really no trouble at all!

94
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,545
I'm just glad I could help out.

95
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,115
Never mind me though, Luffy,
just go and save Ace!

96
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,384
Oh, yeah, right!

97
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,152
Thanks again!

[SALOME hisses]

100
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,395
No way! He managed
to defeat the Pirate Empress!

101
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,433
Unreal! The stare
did nothing! He's a beast!

102

[HANCOCK panting]

103
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,713
[MARINE GG] He smothered her
into submission!

104
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,982
[MARINE HH] I can't believe
how easy he made it look!

105
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,384
Straw Hat Luffy's unstoppable!

106
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,492
Ah. Oh, Luffy. Oh, Luffy!

Oh, Luffy!

My love, you're too much.

109
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,201
Hold me like that again!

The warmth of his embrace still

111
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:29,709
reverberates within my breast--
no, my entire body!

112
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,346
Could it be?

113
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,481
Perhaps...

114
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,885
This is... what people call...

115
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,155
[HANCOCK]
What they call marriage.

[gasps] Luffy! Yes.
This union was meant to be!

Between us lies a thread
that links us together!

An unbreakable bond

138
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,707
that can't be cut.

139
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,244

red string of fate,

Jeez! The Empress is
really looking down on him!

she's started looking up!

I'll do whatever I like!

standing behind you?

Hey, Iva! Be careful!

Don't let him get his paws
on you! They're dangerous!

friends or something?

not acting like himself.

down memory lane for you,

177
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,273
but I'm afraid the Kuma
you know is no longer with us.

178
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,142
This is the new model.

179
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,744
"New model"? Whaddya
think he's talking about?

180
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,780
He wants to get under my skin!

181
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:03,383
Yeah, okay. He's acting pretty
different than usual right now.

182
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,951
But he's still Kuma!

183
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,254
Wake up, buddy! Hey!

184
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:12,893
[IVANKOV grunts]
Damn it all!

185
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,696
Then again, he's always
been the quiet type.

186
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,131
[DOFLAMINGO]
Are you deaf or just stupid?

187
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,101
Trust me, it's no use
trying to talk to him.

188
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,538
It happened just a few days ago.

189
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,740
Dr. Vegapunk,
the Government scientist,

190
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,710
finally finished his
modifications on Kuma.

191
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,212
Now he's the ruthless
weapon of death

192
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:35,049
he should've been
from the start!

193
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,884
Ladies and gentlemen,

194
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,386
the former Bartholomew Kuma!

195
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,455
Doc Vegapunk? Mods?

196
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,757
What the hell are
you talking about?

197
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,260
[DOFLAMINGO] Kuma here
volunteered to be a guinea pig

198
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,596
in a study to build
the ultimate human weapon

199
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,965
run by the Government,
of course!

200
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,102
[DOFLAMINGO]
First, they modified his hands,

201
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,503
then his legs.

202
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,373
Although his mind was still
intact, they modified his body,

203
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,642
piece by piece,
until he was no longer

204
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,010
the same Kuma you know and love.

205
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,147
But that's nonsense!

206
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,849
Kuma always hated the
Government, you jerk!

207
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,020
As if he'd ever sacrifice
himself for their stupid plan!

208
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,490
Hey, Kuma!
Snap out of it! It's me!

209
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,292
[DOFLAMINGO]
Stop yelling.

210
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,461
It's starting to
get on my nerves.

211
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:23,497
I don't know what kind of deal
he had with the Government.

212
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,634
He was just fine a few days ago.

213
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,635
It's funny, but tragic.

214
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,670
Before you know it,
someone's gone.

215
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:33,941
[DOFLAMINGO]
In Kuma's case,

216
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,809
he doesn't even realize
he was ever human,

217
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,745
so the poor sap
might as well be dead.

218
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,348
Now he's just a monster

219
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,017
who the Government
has do their dirty work.

220
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,154
It's the latest, the greatest,

221
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:51,191

229

Kuma! What's the big idea?!

230
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,649
Ya better stop shooting that
laser crap at me right now!

232
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,724
Yeah, I remember.

233
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,527
We will never meet again.

234
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,830
Farewell.

235
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:05,999
Even then, he knew.

236
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,403
What's wrong, Kuma?
Surely you recognize me!

237
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,938
[gasps] That was spooky!
Now where is he?

Damn it Kuma, that's enough!

248
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,073
You forgot me!

249
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,875
But how about my Face Spectrum?!

you are, that's your business.

dangerous the great Ivankov is,

used Ice Age again,

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,349
Nice one!

351
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:04,624
Ace!

352
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:10,130
[gasps]

353
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,798
[PRISONERS yelling]

354
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:16,469
[LUFFY panting]

355
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,406
[MIHAWK]
Apologies, Shanks.

356
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,942
[LUFFY panting]

357
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:24,911
[MIHAWK] But I will not
hold back against him.

358
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,620
Hey, I know him!

359
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,358
[LUFFY]
"Hawk-Eye"!

360
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,468
[MIHAWK]
I wonder what is written?

361
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,805
Will my hand wipe
his name from history?

362
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:53,740
Or perhaps his fortune

363
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:58,078
shall spare him the fury of
this Black Sword I wield.

364
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:03,116
[LUFFY panting]

365
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:15,829
[NARRATOR] Luffy's progress
is halted by Dracule Mihawk,

366
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,097
Warlord of the Sea.

367
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,933
Cleaving apart the
massive wall of ice

368
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,100
surrounding the battlefield,

369
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:23,036
one blow from Mihawk's sword
will rend Luffy in two.

370
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,672
The Whitebeard Pirates counter
with a swordsman of their own,

371
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,841
but will his strength be enough?

372
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,643
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

373
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,378
"The Great Swordsman Mihawk!

374
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,381
Luffy Comes Under the
Attack of the Black Sword!"

375
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,917
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
