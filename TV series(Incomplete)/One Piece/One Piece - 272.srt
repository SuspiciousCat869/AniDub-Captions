1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,737
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,540
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,277
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,186
Riding atop Gomorrah,
four of the Straw Hat Pirates,

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,253
and the Franky Family,

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,257
raced to the Courthouse
Plaza in pursuit of Luffy.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,525
You hear that, Gomorrah?

8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,393
To the courthouse!

9
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,603
Gomorrah!

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,343
Damn!

11
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,044
Who the hell is that?

12
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,256
Don't get too cocky, scumbags.

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,894
All right!

14
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,029
The second one's down, too!

15
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,432
We can't even run away anymore!

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,768
What're we gonna do?

17
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,703
Meanwhile, Sniper King
was making headway

18
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,771
near the Main Island Front Gate.

19
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,483
All right!

20
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,719
Oimo and Kashii
are back on their feet!

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,488
We're screwed.

22
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,193
I don't have the strength to
fight these guys a second time.

23
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,464
We were so close!

24
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,172
You bastards.

25
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,707
How dare you...

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,612
...lie to us?

27
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,686
And now, with our bosses safe,

28
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,622
before we mourn all
those years we wasted--

29
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,559
We're going let out every
last ounce of our anger on you!

30
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,629
Are you ready,
King of the Snipers?

31
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,733
With the assistance
of Oimo and Kashii,

32
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,536
Sniper King is back
on the Straw Hats' trail.

33
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,204
Let us not waste words.

34
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,406
Hoist the signal
for the counter attack!

35
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,609
Soon we shall be
reunited with our comrades!

36
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,480
Gross.

37
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,084
Soon, you'll understand
the extent of your changes.

38
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,320
The birth of new Devil Fruit
users is always exciting.

39
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,423
Enjoy yourselves, but
I'd try to get those powers

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,393
under control
while you still can.

41
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,729
Meanwhile, Luffy was on
the rooftop of the courthouse

42
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,599
waging a fierce battle
against Blueno from CP9.

43
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,038
Iron Body!

44
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,609
Wheel!

45
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,053
Door-Door!

46
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,394
Was that a door on the ground?

47
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,461
Door-Door.

48
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:18,999
Whoa, wait a second!

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,568
Now there's a bunch of little
ones all over the place, too!

50
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,370
Damn it, I can't move!

51
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,638
This sucks!

52
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,110
Revolving Door.

53
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,214
Whoa, what?

54
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,449
I'm not moving
anywhere but I'm spinning!

55
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,420
I dunno which way is front!

56
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,654
Make it stop!

57
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,255
Tempest Kick!

58
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,370
Cook! See that?

59
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,571
Yeah. I saw.

60
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,408
You know what that means;
Luffy is already fighting CP9.

61
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,676
What?

62
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,316
Look.

63
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,016
We gotta run.

64
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,318
We can't wait here any longer.

65
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,185
Yeah.

66
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,553
Let's cut through
to the courthouse.

67
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,456
It's our only option.

68
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,193
Right! Let's go!

69
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:20,261
Are you ready?

70
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,729
Yeah!

71
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,198
Wait! Nobody get off!

72
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,634
What? Why?

73
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,608
Everyone hold on tight!

74
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:45,318
That's-- That's
what Gomorrah says!

75
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:49,790
Go, Gomorrah!

76
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,791
Charge!

77
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,342
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

78
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,744
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,734
Gomorrah!

80
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,935
What are you doing?

81
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,504
You're gonna knock us off
if you keep crashing like that!

82
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,204
Whoa!

83
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,073
Maybe he's too injured to go on!

84
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,080
What? No!

85
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,548
Gomorrah can't see!

86
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,483
His retinas were
damaged in that last attack!

87
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,650
He's blind!

88
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,321
What's that?

89
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:35,122
Gomorrah!

90
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,656
You can't see anything?

91
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,229
It started running like crazy!

92
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,197
Don't just stand there!

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,831
Shoot it!

94
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,165
We gotta stop that thing!

95
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,567
We can't let it go any further!

96
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,435
Fire the trench mortars!

97
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,072
Gomorrah, don't do this!

98
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:52,806
Please stop!

99
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,441
You're in no shape to go on!

100
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,076
You'll kill yourself!

101
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,449
He said that he made
a promise to Sodom.

102
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,354
He told Sodom
"Leave the rest to me!"

103
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,622
"I'll take on your share

104
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,391
and carry everyone
the rest of the way!"

105
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,361
Gomorrah.

106
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,768
They were in its stomach?

107
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:24,071
I'm full already--couldn't
eat another bite.

108
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,107
Let's take 'em
with us as back-up food.

109
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,711
Big Bro!
Come here, quick!

110
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,214
Some pirates gave Sodom and
Gomorrah a serious beating!

111
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,417
You pirates have
got a lotta nerve!

112
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,251
Never touch my family!

113
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:44,792
Hey!

114
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,360
Take it easy, you two!

115
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,828
You're still injured!

116
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,096
This is no time
for a dance party!

117
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,103
Look!

118
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:56,770
We're headed
straight for a dead end!

119
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,039
He'll crash into it and die!

120
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,107
Gomorrah! Stop it!

121
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,543
You'll never make it! Stop!

122
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,380
A dead end?

123
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,348
I don't see one.

124
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,082
Do you?

125
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,383
Nope.

126
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,585
Can't say I see
anything of the sort.

127
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:51,625
It's the Courthouse!

128
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,060
He did it!

129
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,201
You made it, Gomorrah!

130
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,538
All units!

131
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,508
The King Bull carrying the
pirates broke through Block D

132
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,677
and they are now at
the Courthouse Plaza!

133
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,778
I repeat!

134
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:14,180
The King Bull carrying
the pirates broke through--

135
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,352
Look at this, Funkfreed.

136
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,627
A Golden Transponder Snail.

137
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,562
Having this little
gadget is the same

138
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,665
as having the authority
to issue a Buster Call.

139
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,768
That means I have the
same power as a Navy admiral,

140
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,372
or someone even
higher up than that!

141
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,708
Admiral Aokiji
entrusted it to me.

142
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,610
The question is
"if and when will I use it"?

143
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,448
Just you wait!

144
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,450
Once I revive the
ancient weapons,

145
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,419
this won't just be something
that's "on loan" to me.

146
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,555
I'll carry it of my own accord,

147
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,158
along with the power
to control an army.

148
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,129
A Buster Call.

149
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,200
I will now initiate
a Buster Call!

150
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,569
All ships may
commence attack at once!

151
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:11,205
Target every last thing
on this island of archeology

152
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,573
and turn Ohara into ash!

153
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,812
With the single
push of a button,

154
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,548
an entire island will disappear!

155
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,286
Authority can be a
weapon unto itself.

156
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,754
Oh, the power.

157
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:30,224
Chief Spandam!

158
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,759
That was close!

159
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,127
What's wrong with you?

160
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,062
Can't you even knock?

161
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,097
I almost accidentally
hit the button!

162
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,799
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

163
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,402
But I'm afraid we've
got an emergency here!

164
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,672
There's an urgent call from
Enies Lobby's Main Island!

165
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,040
Idiots!

166
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,007
If there's an emergency,

167
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,577
why didn't they just
call my room directly?

168
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,544
What the--?

169
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,378
Hey!

170
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,580
Why is the receiver
off the hook?

171
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,114
This always happens!

172
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,050
Who's responsible?

173
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,618
Well, either way,
you were saying something

174
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,520
about an emergency, weren't you?

175
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,354
Yes sir!

176
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,031
Spanda.

177
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,107
Hey! Ms. Robin!

178
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,209
It seems we have an
urgent report coming in

179
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,712
from the marines
down at the Main Island.

180
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,713
Knowing what it's likely about,

181
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:30,383
I wouldn't call it an
"emergency," exactly.

182
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,586
Your friends tried their best

183
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,656
but only managed to take
down five of our soldiers.

184
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,259
I wonder how they
were ultimately defeated.

185
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,361
Did some of my other
men bring them down,

186
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:44,265
or was it the giant gatekeeping
team of Oimo and Kashii?

187
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,466
So many possibilities.

188
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,536
Why don't we listen to the
report about these idiots

189
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:54,375
who defied the World Government
and learn their fate together?

190
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,643
You're such a scumbag.

191
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,677
Shut up, you low-life!

192
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,816
This is Spandam.

193
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,653
I understand you have a report?

194
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:06,553
Chief Spandam!

195
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,721
Finally! Thank goodness.

196
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,524
I tried your direct line,
but I couldn't get through!

197
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,793
I'm-- I'm not really
sure where to begin.

198
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,262
Calm down!

199
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:15,929
Take it easy.

200
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,731
It's the Straw Hats, right?

201
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,300
Yes, what about them?

202
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:19,767
Whoa!

203
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,601
Hold on!

204
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,602
Listen.

205
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,238
Just pick up from where
your last report ended.

206
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,141
Give me the gritty
details loudly and clearly.

207
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:27,675
Right!

208
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:28,375
The intruders--

209
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,210
Did you accidentally kill them?

210
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,177
Pity.

211
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,178
It's their fault for
being such weaklings.

212
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,382
The intruders consist
of about sixty pirates!

213
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,718
They've pushed their way all
the way through the Main Island

214
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,587
and have reached
the Courthouse Plaza!

215
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,489
We can't stop them, sir!

216
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,331
All personnel on
Enies Lobby's Main Island!

217
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:53,366
Head to the Courthouse
Plaza immediately!

218
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,539
You did a good job, Gomorrah!

219
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:03,343
I swear, everything you
two did will not be in vain!

220
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,380
All right, we're breaking in!

221
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,116
It's time to save
Big Bro Franky!

222
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,651
Yeah!

223
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,389
I repeat: The pirates have
reached the Courthouse Plaza!

224
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,161
Can you see Luffy?

225
00:14:54,194 --> 00:15:00,501
Nope.

226
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,436
But whether he's up
on the roof or not,

227
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,372
it's not exactly like we
can just jump up after him.

228
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,273
That's true.

229
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,243
Not much we can do.

230
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,612
How many members of CP9
did you see up there?

231
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,816
It was just that one
big guy with the bull horns.

232
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,152
It's hard to believe
that Robin, Franky,

233
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:22,389
all of them, are right
behind those doors.

234
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,558
In any case, we need
to catch up with Luffy!

235
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,560
Then we can save Robin together!

236
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,127
Hurry!

237
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,562
Get to the Courthouse!

238
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,164
The drawbridge isn't down yet!

239
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,298
Corner them!

240
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,445
Gero!

241
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,380
Whoa!

242
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,722
That frog's awesome!

243
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,124
That's the same ball
that took out Gomorrah!

244
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,692
Who threw it?

245
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,329
Look!

246
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:03,497
There're three of them!

247
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,199
And they're running away!

248
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,533
Why are they running away?

249
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,302
They're the ones
that attacked first!

250
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,570
Idiot cook!

251
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,805
We can't go chasing around every
enemy that runs off like that!

252
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:13,406
It's a waste of time!

253
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,824
Oh, pipe down.

254
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,492
It's confirmation.

255
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,497
Some of them need to
be chased, understand?

256
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,099
To find out who
we're up against.

257
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,468
That was amazing!

258
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,304
Who is this guy?

259
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,772
He must have superhuman strength

260
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,473
to swing something
like that around!

261
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,275
You think he's part
of some special unit,

262
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,077
like those guard dogs?

263
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,113
There're probably more of them
hiding out there somewhere.

264
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,614
Let's be careful.

265
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,352
We need to get moving.

266
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,554
It looks like the
reinforcements have arrived.

267
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,822
Surround them!

268
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,458
There's no way they'll be able
to open those heavy stone doors!

269
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,726
We'll have them cornered!

270
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,528
Move it!

271
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,596
He's right!

272
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:11,598
Now that I think about it, how--

273
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,335
--are we gonna open--

274
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,038
--those big, stone--

275
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,408
We're going in first!

276
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,177
Stay close-- don't fall behind!

277
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,281
He-- He cut right through
them, like it was nothing!

278
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,649
Hey! Zambai!

279
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,583
Let's split up!

280
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,518
We need to charge
both of those towers--

281
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,355
--'Cuz each side has a lever
to open up that drawbridge.

282
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:34,789
Yeah!

283
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:35,522
Good thinking!

284
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,757
I'm on it!

285
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,758
Right!

286
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,327
Looks like we need to
split into three teams!

287
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,129
Most of you go
with Kiwi and Mozu!

288
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,096
The rest are with me!

289
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,499
We'll crack some heads
in that courthouse!

290
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,201
Good luck, everyone.

291
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,268
Move!

292
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:01,682
Huh?

293
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:04,551
Also, the gatekeepers of
the Main Island Front Gate,

294
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,388
Oimo and Kashii, have
joined up with the pirates!

295
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:11,258
They're currently destroying the
central part of the Main Island!

296
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,360
Get outta the way!

297
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:19,466
After hearing all
the field reports,

298
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,238
our guard casualties total
must be over 2,000 men!

299
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:24,772
Wait.

300
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:25,940
Not five?

301
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,442
And the man who took down
over a thousand of those men

302
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,145
all by himself, the
notorious Straw Hat Luffy,

303
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,746
has suddenly disappeared!

304
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,315
We're still assessing
the situation here!

305
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,720
In the history of this island,
this is, without a doubt, the

306
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,056
absolute worst thing that has
ever happened at Enies Lobby!

307
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,698
It's Blueno!

308
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,732
What's he doing out
there on that rooftop?

309
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,673
What's happening here?

310
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,474
And why now?

311
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,046
What the hell's going on?

312
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,345
Finally!

313
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,446
My face closed!

314
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,581
Of course.

315
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,150
All open doors
will eventually shut.

316
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,121
I'm amazed you still managed
to dodge my Tempest Kick.

317
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,522
Yeah. No big deal.

318
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,390
How unsettling.

319
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,095
Jerk!

320
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:58,732
He's fast!

321
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,469
Finger Pistol!

322
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,338
Shave!

323
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,439
Iron Body!

324
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,507
Strong!

325
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,377
Now Gum Gum--

326
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:12,112
Bullet!

327
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,480
Iron Body!

328
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,119
Tempest Kick!

329
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,035
He's completely keeping
up with my speed.

330
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,705
He even changed the
course of my Tempest Kick!

331
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,609
His physical abilities
are unbelievable.

332
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,312
It's no good.

333
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,082
I can't stay like this.

334
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,550
It won't work.

335
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,453
When I lost to Aokiji,
I realized something.

336
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,155
I said to myself.

337
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,359
"You keep running into guys
that are stronger and stronger.

338
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,295
Unless you can
get stronger too,

339
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,230
you can't protect your friends."

340
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:05,833
And I want to.

341
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,801
They're not all strong like me.

342
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:11,138
But either way, they're my
friends and I wanna keep 'em,

343
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,273
so I have to get
stronger than anyone else.

344
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,476
Otherwise there's a
chance I could lose them.

345
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,213
Then what are you gonna do?

346
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:22,683
I thought of a new way
to fight with all my might,

347
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,552
so that I won't lose anyone.

348
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:32,259
So I won't let anyone
slip away from me.

349
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,327
What's happening to him?

350
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,562
What's going on inside his body?

351
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,302
That did it.

352
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,504
You won't be able
to stop me now.

353
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,239
What?

354
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:49,643
All my strength and techniques
just went up by one step.

355
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,214
Second Gear!

356
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:17,798
You know, truth is, I'm glad
I met you guys when I did.

357
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,466
And why is that?

358
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:23,037
Because thanks to you,
I won't ever lose my friends.

359
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,138
Ridiculous.

360
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,106
You certainly are
full of hot air.

361
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,674
Now Gum-Gum--!

362
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,044
On the next One Piece:

363
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,179
"Everything is to
Protect My Friends!

364
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,081
Second Gear Activated!"

365
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
