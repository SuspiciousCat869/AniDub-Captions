1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,228
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,498
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,372
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,506
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,076
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,046
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,516
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,452
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,722
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,527
[VIGARO] Because I know
he truly is a phoenix.

49
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,131
That he'll rise again and again,
no matter what he faces,

50
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,134
and each time, he'll be
even stronger than the last.

51
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,237
[PUZZLE] I--

52
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,141
[yelling]

53
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,609
[PUZZLE] I'm sorry, everyone.

54
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,311
I've been a fool.

55
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,580
A sorry excuse for a captain
who couldn't even bring

56
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,049
his best friend's
dying wish to fruition.

57
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,619
But now, you've all
brought me back to my senses.

58
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,788
Show these bounty hunters
what we're made of.

59
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,290
We'll reclaim our flag
in Vigaro's name

60
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,160
and fly it proudly in
the winds of the New World!

61
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,563
[LUFFY] Gimme back my flag!

62
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,799
I think the bigger issue
is that Luffy's arrived,

63
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,434
and he doesn't seem very happy.

64
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,301
Robin's got a point!

65
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,237
We're too late!
It's over! We're doomed!

66
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,640
No, there's still
something left we can do.

67
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,507
That's true.

68
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,276
I'm not even sure
how he discovered

69
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,844
the flag was missing
in the first place.

70
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,079
It's a mystery.

71
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,514
But the fact is: he didn't
actually see it being stolen.

72
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,582
Right!

73
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,851
That's why we still have
a chance to pull this off.

74
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,187
I know exactly
where our flag is.

75
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,788
Leave it to me.
I'll get it back!

76
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,856
That's awesome!

77
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,524
Robin, you're the best!

78
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,760
It was stupid to
think we could rely

79
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,695
on that idiotic Moss Head.

80
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,435
If you promise to remain
my big sister forever,

81
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,171
then I promise to
save you from those plants.

82
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,611
You tore the
Accino family apart!

83
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,514
Nobody does that to us!

84
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,283
You're the bastard
who trapped our ship

85
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,617
and stole our flag!

86
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,552
Naked balloon guy!

87
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,388
[ACCINO] Yeah, so what?

88
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,557
What are you going to do
about it, ya little brat?

89
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,126
Pshoo!

90
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,827
I'm gonna beat
the crap out of you!

91
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,363
And then I'm gonna
get our flag back!

92
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,634
[LUFFY]
The Red Hot Decisive Battle!

93
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,337
Luffy vs. The Scorching Don!

94
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,412
Awesome!

95
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,647
So you have
Devil Fruit powers, too, huh?

96
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,716
It's been a long time
since I've hunted down

97
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,884
a pirate bounty.

98
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,353
My children
can usually handle it.

99
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,323
You should be proud
of yourself, Straw Hat.

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,425
"Don" Accino.

101
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,392
I see.

102
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,894
So this must be
the big boss man

103
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,662
to all these
bounty hunters, huh?

104
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,898
It seems like he has
some sort of heat power.

105
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,267
[NAMI] That means these strange
fluctuations in temperature

106
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,601
are probably his doing.

107
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,171
So you're going to beat
the crap out of me, huh?

108
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,238
You've got guts,

109
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,341
but you should know
you're not the first pirate

110
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,544
to make such a ridiculous boast,
and you won't be the last.

111
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,213
Do you wanna know what
happened to the others?

112
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,614
--They were no match for--
--Gum-Gum...

113
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,682
How rude!

114
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,384
I was in the middle
of telling you something!

115
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,619
[LUFFY] ...Pistol!

116
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,523
[yelling in pain]

117
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,362
All I have to do
is touch something,

118
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,564
and it melts into nothing.

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,703
[gasping in awe]

120
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,905
Still think you can beat me?

121
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,375
Gum-Gum...

122
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,611
...Axe!

123
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,714
It burns!

124
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
Luffy can't land
a hit on this guy.

125
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,287
Hit him?
He can't even touch him!

126
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,323
That hurt!

127
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,226
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,729
[ACCINO] You still
don't get it, do you?

129
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,904
--[LUFFY] Ow ow ow ow ow ow!
--Luffy!

130
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,839
It's gonna be hard to beat me

131
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,809
when the only thing you're
doing is hurting yourself.

132
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,280
Every time I try to
punch him, it burns!

133
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,315
[ACCINO]
Heh heh heh!

134
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,418
[ACCINO]
I'm pretty slippery, huh?

135
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,419
Get it?

136
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
He's... skating?

137
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,591
Just another perk
of my Devil Fruit power.

138
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,593
By applying heat to
the bottoms of my feet

139
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,995
and melting
the ice beneath them,

140
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,364
I can slide around
wherever I like!

141
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,965
Nice, huh?

142
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,601
Awesome! Lemme try!

143
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,341
[LUFFY laughing]

144
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,709
What's he doing?

145
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:28,014
--[LUFFY yelling]
--[ACCINO laughing]

146
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,452
[LUFFY and ACCINO laughing]

147
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,454
[ACCINO] Slide and spin!

148
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:43,529
[LUFFY laughing]

149
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,635
I gotta admit...

150
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,970
I really like your power.

151
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,405
[chuckling]

152
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,874
I like yours, too,
Mr. Big Bounty.

153
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,643
[LUFFY, ACCINO]
You're a pretty cool guy!

154
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,711
[NAMI, SANJI]
Morons.

155
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,346
But...

156
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,648
...the real fight begins now!

157
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,817
[LUFFY] Wait. It does?

158
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,086
[ACCINO] Heat Whirlwind!

159
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,721
[LUFFY screaming]

160
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,824
Dammit! I can't see
anything! What'd you do?

161
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,727
[ACCINO] Heat Rise!

162
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,996
[LUFFY screaming]

163
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,564
[LUFFY]
Hey! Let me go!

164
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:21,000
[JIRO] Our flags are somewhere
inside that big mansion.

165
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,003
C'mon. Let's get moving.

166
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,538
Huh? But what about--

167
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,039
He'll be fine.
Let's get the flags.

168
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,374
All right!

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,844
[ACCINO] Hold it!

170
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,451
I really do love children.

171
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,422
Well, my own children, that is!

172
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,025
[CHOPPER and JIRO yelling]

173
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,527
--Chopper!
--Chopper!

174
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,128
[CHOPPER]
So windy!

175
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,430
Put me down,
you naked balloon!

176
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,798
Take it easy, kid.

177
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,767
You'll be down soon enough.

178
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,773
I'm gonna smash you flat, kiddo.

179
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,709
Steam Iron!

180
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,713
Wahhh! No! Luffy!

181
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,717
[CAMPACINO] I can't
let Papa get any angrier.

182
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,655
But there's no stopping him now
that he's fighting Straw Hat.

183
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,157
[CAMPACINO] All right,
Mr. 100 million Berry bounty!

184
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,159
It's time to bring you to Papa!

185
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,394
Not gonna happen.

186
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,664
A two-bit bounty hunter like
you could never take me down!

187
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,646
[CAMPACINO] Arrogant chump.

188
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,749
You're not even in
the same league as me!

189
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,085
Soon, the tide will change.

190
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,454
Ohohohohoho!

00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,500
So cold! I'm freezing!

193
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,102
[LAGO, RACE]
They're trapping us with ice!

194
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,103
Man up!

195
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,505
A little ice is no match
for a Phoenix Pirate!

196
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,773
I'm trying,
but it's just that--

197
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,809
[muffled speech]

198
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,010
[ACCINO] That's more like it.

199
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,613
I can almost taste
your bounty already.

200
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,154
You hurt my head,
naked bastard!

201
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:22,955
Wha--?

202
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,824
That should have
finished you off!

203
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,158
[LUFFY] At first
I was squished and hot,

204
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,961
but then the ice
started melting and I sank!

205
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,862
Felt good!

206
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,030
Is that so?

207
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,633
Then this time
I'll make it so hot

208
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,868
you won't live
to tell me about it.

209
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,838
No amount of ice will
cool you off after this!

210
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,574
Temperature up!

211
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,976
3000 degrees!

212
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,145
How are you making
all that cool smoke?

213
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,580
[ACCINO] It's not smoke!

214
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,015
Either way, as long
as I don't touch you,

215
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,583
you can't burn me.

216
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,394
[LUFFY straining]

217
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,433
All right, Gum-Gum...

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,835
...Bazooka!

219
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,570
[ACCINO]
Augh!

220
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:13,873
All right!

221
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,041
You sure showed him!

222
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,008
Nice shot!

223
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,910
Luffy!

224
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,879
Come on! We don't
have time to celebrate!

225
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,781
The faster he
finishes this guy off,

226
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,051
the faster he'll be able to
get back the flag on his own!

227
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,585
Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap!

228
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,420
This is bad!

229
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,120
If he does that,
he'll know for sure

230
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,922
that we lost it to begin with!

231
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,891
Hey, wait, what's he doing now?

232
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,065
That's it.
You've made me mad now!

233
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,976
That's what you get for relying
on such a primitive weapon.

234
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,779
I'm afraid this is the end!

235
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,482
[PENGUINS squawking]

236
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,216
Dammit!

237
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,718
We'll be completely frozen over!

238
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,087
If this keeps up, we won't
be able to move an inch!

239
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,887
Crap!

240
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,089
Bastards!

241
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,323
Listen, guys!

242
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,927
We need to huddle up and share
our body heat to keep warm!

243
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,101
It's stinky!

244
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,670
It's way stinkier down here!

245
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,504
Oh, shut up!

246
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,072
You think any of us
like the smell?

247
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,073
Get over it!

248
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,142
It's not like there's
a rescue team coming.

249
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,243
It's up to us!

250
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,746
[STANSEN] Oh, yeah!
It's better to fight on our own!

Damn straight, Captain Stansen!

252
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,750

Yes, sir!

259
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,985
You're the first opponent
I've ever gone up against

260
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,121
that's worn me out
like this, Straw Hat.

261
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,290
Heh! Too tired
to fight me then?

262
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,391
Not to mention,

263
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,027
you're the first opponent
to piss me off this much.

And Straw Hat!

268
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,176
Since we haven't heard
anything back from Robin yet,

269
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,812
we have no choice but to
take that flag back ourselves.

270
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,679
You're right!

271
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,648
We have to get it
back before Luffy!

00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,583

I'm sorry I made you
worry about me all this time.

It's no big deal.

I was never really
that worried, Captain.

Now it's time
to get our flag back.

pride of the Phoenix Pirates

dodging my attacks,

but you can't dodge forever.

like Heat-Heat Gatling!

No way! That's my move!

[LUFFY] Man, he's fast!

301

But what good is that supposed
to do when the eggs are so slow?

302

Hey! Move!

00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,783
Dodge them, you idiot!

That was close!

I don't care about collecting
your bounty anymore.

307
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,969
This is personal!

00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,738
I hope you're
ready to sweat, boy!

309
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,841
If five thousand still isn't
hot enough for you, fine!

310
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,076
I'll just have
to turn up the steam!

Quit treating me like
a sauna, naked balloon!

this world, Straw Hat!

Don't worry!

325

probably got something else

00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,932
to worry about right now.

I know, without a doubt,

will get our flag back.

to teach that brat a lesson!

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,405
Lay one finger on that girl
and I'll make you regret it.

356
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,240
[USOPP] It never ends, does it?

357
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,913
[SANJI] Let go of my Robin,
you stupid plants!

358
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,282
[USOPP] Yeah! Let's show
this shrub who's boss!

359
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,821
Are your friends really
that important to you?

360
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,757
Yes. They're here
for me and our pride.

361
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,093
You mean the
Straw Hat Pirate flag?

362
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,360
It's strange.

363
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,263
Papa always seems so happy with
his collection of pirate flags,

364
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,365
but... not me.

365
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,801
I never really cared
that much about them.

366
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,036
Right.

367
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,272
To most people, a simple flag
wouldn't be that important.

368
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,275
But for pirates, like us, it is.

369
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,312
Even more important
than our lives.

370
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,781
There's no way
we'd ever let it go.

371
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,725
If it means so much
to you, then I--

372
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,127
[loud banging noise]

373
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,395
Oh, no! This is bad!

374
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,364
Papa is really angry!

375
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,667
[USOPP] Help! Save me!

376
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,370
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

377
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,839
Eating him will
give you indigestion!

378
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,810
[LIL screaming]

379
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,410
Lil!

380
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,980
[USOPP] Gunpowder Star!

381
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,323
[ROBIN] Lil!

382
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,162
It's okay now. You're safe.

383
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,230
You... You saved me.

384
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,199
If anything happened to you,

385
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,102
Big Sister Robin would be sad.

386
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,038
Gotta keep my precious
little sister safe.

387
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,439
Don't you see, Lil?

388
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,741
You're not alone.

389
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,009
You've never been.

390
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,777
Treasure your family.

391
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,692
[NAMI] Wait...

392
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,427
Is that what I think it is?

393
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,030
[LUFFY] Second Gear!

394
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,868
You'll never win.
Just give up.

395
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:03,902
Never!

396
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,205
I'm here to take back our flag!

397
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,906
I won't let you.

398
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,410
And if you can't beat me, you'll
never make it in the New World!

399
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,249
I'm going.
It's already been decided.

400
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,917
It's only a matter of time.

401
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,220
Nobody's gonna to stop me.

402
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,755
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

403
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,893
[LUFFY]
...Jet Pistol!

404
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,806
--There it is!
--There it is!

405
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,951
--[yelling in pain]
--[JIRO] It hurts!

406
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,986
Hot!

407
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,328
[CHOPPER] Zoro! You rule!

408
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,264
I'll die before I let go!

409
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,498
This is our flag!

410
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,934
This is our pirate pride!

411
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,870
Jiro!

412
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,216
Look, Captain.
I found it. Our flag.

413
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,450
Good work, Jiro.

414
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,818
Well done.

415
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,996
High Heat Nose Jet Surprise!

416
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,331
Pshoo!

417
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,503
[USOPP, SANJI] Chopper!

418
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,172
Hey guys!

419
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,340
[laughing]

420
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,210
Look! I got our flag
back before Luffy!

421
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,478
Just in time!

422
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,314
All right! We did it!

423
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,183
Now there's nothing
Luffy can say--Huh?!

424
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,153
No! You gotta be kidding me!

425
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,487
[screaming]

426
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,092
It was right in front of me!

427
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,328
How could this have happened?

428
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,999
Now we're right back
where we started, huh?

429
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,672
Were Robin and Sanji able
to find our flag in time?

430
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,507
Don't tell me it's one of those!

431
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,695
[ACCINO] You hurt my family.

432
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,531
Destroyed Lovely Land.

433
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:50,535
And decimated my
precious flag collection!

434
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,905
I'll rip you apart
with my bare hands!

435
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,644
Time to feel
my full heat power!

436
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,280
Maximum Temperature!

437
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,316
10,000 degrees!

438
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,388
So he can get even hotter!

439
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,099
[FRANKY]
Well! This battle's heating up!

440
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,235
They're going to melt
all the ice at this rate!

441
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,736
[ROBIN]
They'd better get back soon.

442
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,172
I'm starting to get
concerned about our Log Pose.

443
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
[FRANKY] No worries!

444
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,441
If they take too long out there,

445
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:33,478
I'll just zip over and pick 'em
up in my super sharkmarine!

446
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,247
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

447
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,681
Waiting in the New World!

448
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,084
Farewell to the
Courageous Pirates!

449
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,686
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
