WEBVTT

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.171
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.174
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.326
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.625
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.494
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.532
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.835
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.437
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.605
they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.440
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.843
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.045
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:02.582
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.852
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.489
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:13.026
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.832
[NARRATOR] Two years have
passed since the War of the Best

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.201
in Marineford.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:24.971
Luffy and his crew reunite to
continue on to the New World.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.774
The first stop on their
journey is Fishman Island,

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:31.377
which resides thousands
of feet below sea level.

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.546
Now, they're
separated once again,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.482
stirring up trouble all
over the ocean floor.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.618
Luffy smuggled the
princess Shirahoshi

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.988
out of Ryugu Palace
for an adventure.

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:43.723
Robin received a lead
on the whereabouts

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.492
of a Poneglyph hidden
on Fishman Island.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.361
[ROBIN] The crew can
take care of themselves.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:51.864
I can't miss a chance to uncover
the world's lost history.

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.801
[NARRATOR] Franky stumbled upon
the Sunny at the Sea Forest.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.036
a resting place
for sunken ships.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.838
[DEN chuckles]

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.707
I'll do the ship
coating for you.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.676
And I'll do it with gusto.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.712
[FRANKY] Haven't heard
that one in a while.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.481
Oh, uh, sorry, I never
caught your name.

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:10.250
Call me Den.

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.385
[FRANKY] By way, I've been
meaning to ask you.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.487
There's a dude sitting
all alone over there.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.722
Do you know who he is?

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:19.459
Uh-huh! That would
be the Boss, Jimbei.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:21.694
Consider it a term
of endearment.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.830
He's waiting for someone.

00:04:23.863 --> 00:04:26.266
[NARRATOR] After Zoro,
Usopp, Nami, and Brook

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.202
managed to accidentally
seize the palace,

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.037
they found themselves
face-to-face

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.873
with the rebel uprising of
Hordy and Vander Decken,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:37.610
who are out to destroy
Ryugu Kingdom.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.912
[DECKEN]
Someone took my Shirahoshi?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.915
Ah! This is a tragedy!

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.484
[NEPTUNE]
She's not yours!

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.086
And damn right it's a tragedy!

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.721
[DECKEN yells]

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:50.857
We've been in love
for ten years!

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.426
Nothing can tear
us apart, Princess!

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.595
Except death, that is!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.133
[laughing]

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.136
If I can't have you,
then nobody can!

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.540
You're about to be a big,
beautiful corpse, Shirahoshi!

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.280
[LUFFY]
"The Battle in the Ryugu Palace!

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.982
Zoro vs. Hordy!"

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.495
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Oh, that one's an octopus!

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.964
And that looks like a blowfish!

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.801
And look! There's a
killifish over there!

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:37.770
That's lame. Do all clouds
look like fish to you?

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.907
That's a rice ball!

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.876
And that one looks
like a giant doughnut!

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.746
A chunk of meat!

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.981
They all look like
food to you, Luffy!

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.817
[LUFFY chuckles]
Guess so!

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.018
[SHIRAHOSHI chuckles]

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:57.890
[NEPTUNE]
Jamon! Jamon! Jamon!

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:01.961
Hold on.

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.863
What's the matter with you now?

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.465
[SHIRAHOSHI]
My poor father!

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:09.435
He's surely found me missing.
He must be worried sick by now!

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.737
[crying]

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.839
[LUFFY] Ah, jeez, is there
anything that doesn't

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.340
make you cry?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.843
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.711
Cheer up, ya sissy!

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.818
You goof!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.556
Hey, I'm not tryin'
to make you laugh!

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.525
Swallow her back up, shark!

00:06:38.498 --> 00:06:42.402
[NEPTUNE crying]

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:48.241
Vander Decken is going to
capture my precious Shirahoshi!

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.043
Poor Neptune!

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:55.181
[NEPTUNE]
Please. I beg of you people!

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.884
I'll give you anything
you ask for!

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.952
Just let me go after Decken!

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.891
You can have my
kingdom's fortune!

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.860
You can even take my
soldiers' lives if you want!

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.795
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.797
No, King! They can't!

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.167
[NEPTUNE] I can't let that
beast catch Shirahoshi!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.170
My sweet, innocent,
not-so little girl!

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.071
[crying]

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.108
[HORDY] You're quite the
pathetic sight, Neptune.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.376
But what a shock.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.678
I was confident that I
could take the palace,

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:27.847
but I never thought the
loathsome Straw Hats

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.183
would be part of the story.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:31.484
[NAMI]
He knows us?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.996
[NAMI] He's got the mark
of Arlong on his arm!

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.166
[HORDY chuckling]

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.267
Jimbei.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.269
He tried to warn me that there
was something wicked

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.171
going on in the
Fishman District.

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.172
But you...

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.374
How could a former
soldier of Neptune's army

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.709
be the ringleader?

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.644
Shame on you! Hordy!

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.014
[laughs]

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.249
Shame, huh?

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.285
[laughing]

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.520
I'm sorry.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:10.323
I can't drum up any shame,
maybe because I never

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:13.292
felt pride in the army
to begin with.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.229
Listen, there's only
one reason why I joined,

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.231
and that was to
learn combat skills

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.500
so I can turn this
world upside down.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:21.667
Simple as that.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.069
You traitor!

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:25.638
[HORDY]
You helped me set things right.

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.873
What do you mean?

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.709
[HORDY] The comforts of your
royal palace have blinded you

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.378
to what's been happening
on this island.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.415
[HORDY]
Ever since I was a child,

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:38.317
as far back as I can remember,

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.754
I've seen Fishmen oppressed
by barbaric humans.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.457
[DOSUN]
Ah! Help me, someone!

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.725
[yells]

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.196
All the trouble it took
to get to this island,

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.031
we might as well grab
a couple of souvenirs

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.533
to take back with us, huh?

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.201
[GROUP laughs]

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:57.470
Please, just let me go! Help!

00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:59.305
[GROUP]
Give us back our friend!

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.073
[yells]

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:02.675
[grunts]

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.578
Well, look at this.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.580
A couple of rowdy Fishman brats.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:08.981
You wanna join us?

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:12.018
I mean, you're not worth
as much as any Merfolk,

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.052
but y'know.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.087
if we sell you off as a set,
the auction house

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.123
might cut us a deal.

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.592
All right.
I've heard enough of your crap.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:23.362
[MEN grunting]

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:26.198
[ARLONG] Pathetic creatures
can't even breathe underwater.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.668
And yet, no matter
how many we kill,

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.002
they don't stop.

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.948
[HORDY] Arlong had a fierce
determination to suffocate

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.183
the arrogance out of humankind.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.252
I deeply admired him for that.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:52.558
And now, we will
restore his dream.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.895
The New Fishman Pirates
continue his legacy!

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.666
[HORDY] He was the reason
I cultivated my strength.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.401
I had to train until
I was strong enough

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.604
to become Arlong's
right-hand man.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.340
I dreamed of standing by
his side when he conquered

00:10:07.373 --> 00:10:09.508
the world from the East Blue.

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.243
Well...

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.846
I did until you humans
came along and crushed

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.514
everything he worked for.

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.853
Oh, man!

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.388
I thought we were
done with Arlong.

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:23.990
Can't you just let it go?

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.596
What? Not Arlong!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.764
I'm just kidding.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.233
In truth, I don't even
know who Arlong is.

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.535
I just didn't wanna
be left out, y'know?

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.903
Yohohoho--agh!

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:41.907
Ow! How rude!

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.610
I'll have you know
that I bruise easily!

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.946
Shut up!
This is no time for jokes!

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:51.917
Enough chit-chat.
We have business.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.353
So let's get down to it.

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.554
Stand back!

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.291
What the--?

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:00.459
Shark Grip!

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.368
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.370
He's doing that
with just his fingers?

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:13.406
Is he trying to bring
the palace down?

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.111
[PAPPAGU]
Okay, I am so not into this!

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.346
I'll check you later!

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.786
Camie. I need a favor from you.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:27.853
[CAMIE]
Huh?

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.894
Is that his own strength?

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:37.830
Yeah, he hasn't taken
a single energy steroid.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.365
Not yet at least.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.233
[HORDY yells]

00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.936
[MAN A yells]
He just destroyed that pillar!

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:54.914
Ah, damn!

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.615
The creep's flooding the joint!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.090
I came here for a banquet,
not for drowning!

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.558
[BROOK crying]

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.093
[HORDY laughs]

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.636
Oh, crap, water drops!

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.671
Hit the deck!

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.905
He's gonna do it!

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:20.973
[PIRATE H gasps]

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.147
Shark Arrows!

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:33.719
Those're gonna hit the guards!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:34.954
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.188
[FISHMEN yell]

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.724
[USOPP, BROOK yell]

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.899
[NEPTUNE]
You monster!

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:51.837
My guards are innocent men;
how dare you shoot them down!

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.372
Leave them be!

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.407
You deranged cretin!

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:59.044
King Neptune!

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:00.546
You can't do that, sire!

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.983
[NEPTUNE] Your lives
are my responsibility!

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:05.818
[FISHMEN]
Your highness, no!

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.186
[HORDY]
Sentimental fool!

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.622
Risking his life
for lowly pawns.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:13.159
Just more proof that you don't
have what it takes to be king!

00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.560
King Neptune!

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.295
Damn you, Hordy!

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.531
Why? They're chained
and unarmed!

00:13:18.564 --> 00:13:20.099
Damn. He's brutal.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.035
Also, he's way stronger
than Arlong ever was!

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:31.177
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.411
Bird Dance!

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.282
[PIRATES gasp]

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:37.483
Wait, Boss, please!

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:41.387
Can't you just move
out of the way?

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:19.425
That creep!

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.794
He used his own
crewmate as a shield!

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.195
Hey. You two.

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.130
Go untie all of the soldiers.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.198
[USOPP, BROOK]
Huh?

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:29.501
Our negotiation
with the kingdom.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.870
It collapsed.

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:34.440
We gave them our word to give
back all the hostages unharmed.

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:36.709
And we couldn't
keep that promise.

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:38.944
They're so honest.

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:41.013
[USOPP]
You're right. I'm on it!

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:42.581
[BROOK] Ah...
My foot's in the water!

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.450
I can feel my life
draining away!

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.318
Help me, Nami!

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:48.821
Wait. Where's Nami? Look.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.223
Huh? She's gone?

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.625
It's not just her!

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.393
Camie has gone missing, too!

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.232
Oh, great!

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.934
We're losing our
friends left and right!

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.370
First priority is releasing
these guys, though.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.739
Just try to hang in there
and keep at it, Brook!

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:08.774
Always riding my bones.

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.142
I recommend running now.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:12.177
Oh!

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.680
I need you to untie your
other comrades, please.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.849
I'm afraid I don't have
the energy for it.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.752
Untie the others quickly
and take up your arms!

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.954
Don't let them do a damn thing!

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.657
Destroy Neptune's army
and the Straw Hats.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.258
Kill them all!

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.360
[PIRATES yell]

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.130
Special Attack:
Green Star "Rafflesia"!

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:37.469
Whoa! That shot turned
into a giant flower!

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.138
With such exotic flora!

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.073
Breathe deep!

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.508
[PIRATES]
Ugh!

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.109
Gah! It stinks!

00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:47.179
[coughs]
Damn. Bunch of fools.

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:48.681
[USOPP laughs]

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.649
Enjoy!

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:51.850
I'm dying here.

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:54.019
C'mon, Zoro! Let's move!

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:58.424
Listen up.

00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:01.393
Do me a favor and help
those two get out of here.

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:03.495
[NEPTUNE]
And what about you?

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.397
[ZORO] We're not gonna
make it out of here.

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:07.299
Not if that guy's chasing us.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.676
This is a revolution...
and you're in the way.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.953
[FRANKY]
All right, well that's a relief.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.956
Doesn't look like
anything's broken.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.826
Sorry I put you through the
ringer like that, partner.

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.995
You just rest here for a while
and build your strength

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.730
back up.

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:38.931
Hey, pal.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.566
You want me to help
out with the coating?

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.700
[DEN]
Not necessary.

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.169
A man's best off sticking
to his own trade.

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:46.205
[FRANKY] Good point.
I'll leave you to it.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:48.273
Well, look at that,
there you are.

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:49.308
Sunny!

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.977
Heya, Robin!

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:53.612
Huh? This a friend of yours?

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:56.181
Yep. You finish up
all your business?

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.182
Not yet.

00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.651
I've still got something
big I need to check on.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.819
And there it is.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.188
[DEN] Hey! Where d'ya
think you're going?

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:05.557
Outsiders aren't supposed
to go in there.

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.693
[ROBIN]
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

00:17:07.726 --> 00:17:10.596
Heh! She's a weird one, huh?

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:11.697
[DEN]
Seriously?

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.632
No offense,
but look who's talking.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:22.307
[GROUP grunting]

00:17:24.643 --> 00:17:25.778
Quite impressive.

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.048
You were the only one quick
enough to dodge my arrows.

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:33.452
But then again,
you've seen them before.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:35.454
I have a lot of
respect for Arlong,

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.889
but I've surpassed him.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.861
Your skills are
inconsequential now.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:44.229
You're helpless here.

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:47.399
No human stands a chance
against a Fishman in the sea!

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.403
Yah!

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.373
[HORDY laughs]

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:05.517
[HORDY]
Yah!

00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.120
[laughing]

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:11.390
There's no deflecting
my arrows in the water!

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.959
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style! Tatsu-Maki!

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:20.866
Oh. Not bad.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.434
I can let loose.

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.875
[ZORO] I can't keep this
up for much longer.

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.181
[CHOPPER]
Just stay with me, Hachi!

00:18:36.215 --> 00:18:38.050
You're gonna be okay!

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.718
[HACHI grunts]

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.787
No, you need to get out of here!

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.056
Quit worrying about us,
we'll be fine!

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:47.226
C'mon! Focus on you first!

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:48.861
What's up with the angry mob?

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.762
Give us back the Mermaids!

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.966
[FISHMAN G] Yeah! We're nothing
but objects to you humans!

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:55.968
[SANJI] Hm?
What're you talking about?

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.003
[FISHMAN H]
Don't play dumb, pirates!

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.505
The word's gotten around town!

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:00.506
We know you did it!

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.474
We know you kidnapped
all those poor Mermaids

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.709
from the beach in the south!

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:06.044
Where did you take them, huh?

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:08.847
You've got the wrong guys here.

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.116
Besides, what gives you
the idea that we're the ones

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.251
behind this?

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:14.253
I mean, I will admit.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:16.321
I love Mermaids so much
I want to keep them

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.790
all for myself!

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.627
Regardless, our crew
didn't kidnap them.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.930
You hear that? He just
admitted that he wants them!

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.431
Will you jerks shut up?

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.267
There's a dying man here!

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.102
[FISHMAN D]
I knew you pirates were guilty!

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.837
[FISHWOMAN A]
Get off our island!

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:32.871
[CHOPPER]
Ow!

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.177
Hey, this bottle is almost full!

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.778
That's a waste of good booze!

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.380
Shut up, human!

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:44.716
Oh, hey! Sanji! Chopper!

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.819
Hey, Sanji! Get your
nose under control?

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.556
Luffy! Is that a blowfish?

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.861
Who is that human gentleman?

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:57.729
And is that...

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.064
...a raccoon!

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:01.433
It looks just like
the picture I saw!

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:04.102
You know them, Luffy?
You're friends?

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:07.239
[LUFFY] Yeah, those guys
are my crewmembers.

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.174
Wow. Interesting crew.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.044
Look! Up there, the captain
of the Straw Hat crew!

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.312
You're right, it is!

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.314
You gave the order
to kidnap the mermaids.

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:16.215
Didn't you?

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.583
[MEGALO choking]

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:22.020
We can't let all of the
people down there see me.

00:20:22.054 --> 00:20:24.022
Hey! Shut your mouth, hurry!

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.995
[LUFFY yells]

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:31.863
I'm gonna go check
things out on the ground.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:32.898
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Huh?

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:36.935
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.203
[FISHMAN E]
He jumped off!

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:42.541
Hey! Hachi! What happened?

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.042
Leave, Straw Hat.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.944
Did some jerk do this to you?

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.279
Tell me who it was!

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:50.082
We tried, but he won't
say for some reason.

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:53.585
[HACHI]
You have to get off the island!

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:56.188
That's the only thing he'll say.

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:57.823
[FISHMAN F]
Hang on a second.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:00.892
I heard that Straw Hat had
taken over the Ryugu Palace.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.827
It's a ploy.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.096
He's out to kidnap
more of us Mermaids.

00:21:04.129 --> 00:21:07.566
He left his men at the palace
so he could go out marauding!

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.067
I know what he wants!

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.903
He's gonna kidnap
Princess Shirahoshi too!

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.872
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.507
That's absurd and you know it.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.709
The princess is
the size of an Orca.

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:20.145
Plus, she's the God of
the Sea's only daughter,

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.079
remember?

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.282
Some lowlife might
dream of kidnapping her,

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.450
but nobody could pull it off.

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:28.687
Huh? What's up
with that blowfish?

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:32.724
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:35.694
No!

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.739
[MEGALO choking]

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.921
[SHIRAHOSHI yelps]

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:08.427
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.337
[CHOPPER]
Huh?!

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:28.613
[FISHMEN]
Princess Shirahoshi?

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:29.981
Um... I, uh...

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.484
Well, um, y'see...

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:35.954
Uh, good job, you found me!

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:39.725
She's huge! Oh, no. Is she...

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.960
...the Mermaid Princess?

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:43.195
[SANJI]
Hey, what's up?

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.330
Something going on behind me?

00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:46.565
No, it's nothing!

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:49.234
No matter what you hear,
please don't turn around!

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.303
Huh? Why, what's the big deal?

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:55.173
Don't do it!
I don't want you to die, Sanji!

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.908
Ah, jeez.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.282
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:07.953
The Pirates!
They kidnapped the princess!

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:16.161
[NARRATOR] Luffy's captured by a
group of stalwart fishermen

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:19.364
who are enraged by Shirahoshi's
apparent kidnapping.

00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:21.032
Suddenly, Vander Decken appears,

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:24.669
forcing Luffy into combat
despite his arms being tied.

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.838
If Luffy can escape
to the sea forest,

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.807
He will be reunited with Sanji,

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.510
but the lecherous chef may not
survive the sight of the

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:32.778
mermaid princess.

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.379
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.783
"Keep Shirahoshi Safe!
Decken Close Behind!"

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:39.751
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
