1
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,116
[LUFFY]
Alright, let's go, let's go!

2
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,586
[LUFFY]
There's nothing at all!

3
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,056
[neighing]

4
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,224
Chopper. That's not a giraffe.

5
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,393
That's a horse
with a long neck.

6
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,261
A long horse.

7
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,430
Gum-gum whip!

8
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,302
[loud crash]

9
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,538
[CHOPPER]
What's going on?!

10
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:22,108
Well, uh, I think that
bamboo tree was possessed.

11
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,416
This can't be good.

12
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,152
[FOXY CREW A] We are
the notorious Foxy Pirates!

13
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,321
We want more than
just a fight from you.

14
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,489
We want a showdown!

15
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,302
[TONJIT]
I'm in your debt!

16
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,638
Come to my house and let me
show you some hospitality!

17
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,473
[LUFFY]
Awesome! I'm starving!

18
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,474
[CHOPPER]
Me too!

19
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,143
[TONJIT] Finally home,
after all these years!

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,812
It's a custom in this
village to treat visitors

21
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,682
to extra-delicious milk from
our extra-long farm animals.

22
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,485
Village? I didn't see
any village out there.

23
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,453
Or a farmhouse.

24
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,058
Now that you mention it.

25
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,793
[shocked gasp]

26
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:16,230
[TONJIT] The village is
gone! All our animals, too!

27
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,565
You're nuts, old man.
I know it's been ten years,

28
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,668
but whole villages
don't just disappear.

29
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,270
[TONJIT]
Yes, but this is a special case.

30
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,139
I'll save the explanation until

31
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,408
after we've had
a nice cool drink.

32
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,744
I believe I had some milk
tucked away somewhere.

33
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,212
Hmm...

34
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,447
Did you say "milk"?

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,182
You realize you were
stuck on those stilts

36
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,450
for ten years, right?

37
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,385
[shocked gasp]

38
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,223
I... uh... hope this
cheese is to your liking.

39
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,357
You think we're stupid?!

40
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,428
You can't pass off your
disgusting old milk as cheese!

41
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,064
[TONIT] If you don't want
to eat it, I won't force you.

42
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,533
But far be it from me to
let cheese go to waste.

43
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,169
Wait so you're saying it's okay
to eat this stuff after all?

44
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,171
Are you out of your mind?!

45
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,238
What's the big deal?

46
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,774
Some cheese tastes better
once it's finely aged!

47
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,644
Your high-stress lifestyles
have made your stomachs weak,

48
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,046
whereas laid back
fellows, such as myself,

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,348
can eat whatever we like!

50
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,450
You kids go on your
fancy adventures,

51
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,185
but you're shy when
it comes to new food!

52
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,290
Someone, call a doctor.

53
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,492
What did you think
was gonna happen? Moron!

54
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,261
Doctor, someone
get a doctor, hurry!

55
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,195
Wait, that's me!

56
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,732
It's food poisoning.

57
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,733
Yeah, you think?

58
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,201
Ha ha ha ha!

59
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,035
You're funny old man!

60
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,505
You okay?

61
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,508
Yes, excluding the fact that
the entire camp packed up

62
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,176
and moved on without me.

63
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,311
I see now.

64
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,346
The village didn't
disappear, it moved.

65
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,582
That must mean the
people here are nomads!

66
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,619
Indeed, and Long Ring
Long Land Island is our home.

67
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,054
You are welcome here.

68
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,722
Oh, uh, thanks.

69
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,126
The island got its name
from its ring-like shape.

70
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,194
Although it's
technically one big circle,

71
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,797
the tides divide it
into 10 smaller islands.

72
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,333
You probably wouldn't
guess that all of the islands

73
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,402
were actually connected.
But once a year,

74
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,137
when the tides
are at their lowest,

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,205
you can see Long
Ring's true form,

76
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,107
if only for a few hours.

77
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,743
We use this time to migrate
from one island to the next,

78
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,614
every three years, circling
the ring again and again.

79
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,649
So everyone moved to
the next island while

80
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,053
you were stuck up in the
trees. What rotten luck.

81
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:22,056
That's a good one!
You're a real rebel, old man!

82
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,091
If they stay on each
island for three years

83
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,226
then subtracting the
10 years you spent living

84
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,795
on those stupid
bamboo stilts.

85
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,663
It would still take a
good twenty years for them

86
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,665
to come back around and
meet up with you again,

87
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,300
assuming you don't eat
that "cheese" of yours

88
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,202
and die of food
poisoning, of course.

89
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,670
Well, it's sad, but true.

90
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:41,375
I just wish I had my
hooo-oorse to ride again.

91
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,144
Then I could cross an
island every time the tides

92
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,111
were low and catch up

93
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,414
to the other villagers
in only five years.

94
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,750
Hoooo-orse?

95
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:50,817
That's right.

96
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,553
They're the most graceful
and beautiful animals

97
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,255
on the whole island.

98
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,123
Once tamed, they
can be used to cross

99
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,059
the grassy plains with
the greatest of ease.

100
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,561
Without them, it
would be impossible

101
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,763
for our people
to migrate.

102
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,765
After all, our belongings
are far too heavy

103
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,500
to carry on our own.

104
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,235
And even if we
were strong enough

105
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,638
to move all our luggage,
the tide would still rise

106
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,107
and drown us before
we could make it across.

107
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,042
Wouldn't it be easier
to take a boat instead?

108
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,344
Yes, of course
but unfortunately,

109
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,445
we don't know how to sail.

110
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,214
And besides even
if we were able

111
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,049
to charge a Log Pose
here, that doesn't mean

112
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,551
it would point
to the next island.

113
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,520
The land may be
split into ten pieces,

114
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,689
but it's all part
of the same place.

115
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,592
Suppose I'll just
have to wait 20 years.

116
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,429
You'll be lonely.
That's a long time.

117
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,431
Oh! Wait a second.

118
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:41,201
Is a hoooo-ooorse
like a horse?

119
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,770
Hey, I almost forgot about that!

120
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,005
We saw a horse on the way here!

121
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,045
Oh, my sweet little Shelly,

122
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,414
you waited for me
all these years!

123
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,649
You're such a pretty
girl! Look at you!

124
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,218
So cute! I missed
you so much!

125
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,654
You've sure grown
long since I've been away!

126
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,290
Awe, you make
me so proud!

127
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:06,427
Good girl!
That's a good girl!

128
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm so sorry if you were
lonely while I was gone!

129
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,198
It's all my fault!

130
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,767
I promise I'll never
leave you again!

131
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,338
Don't leave her waiting!

132
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,540
She wants to
go out for a ride!

133
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,489
[USOPP]
What a pal, huh?

134
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,724
Even though everyone else left,

135
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,159
she still hung
around all these years.

136
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,161
[LUFFY]
That's my kind of horse!

137
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,565
[CHOPPER] I don't know which one
of them is happier right now!

138
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,534
[TONJIT laughs happily]

139
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,572
Man that horse
sure is fast, huh?

140
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,374
I wanna ride it too!

141
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,210
I see why that old man
likes horses so much!

142
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,412
[thinking] Now that I'm back,
let's cross the sea together

143
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,448
as soon as the tide
is low again, okay?

144
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,350
You've waited
through rainy days.

145
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,686
And you've waited
through snowy days as well.

146
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,089
But from now on, we'll
have nothing but sunshine!

147
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,233
[NOMAD MAN A] Shelly,
are you sure you want

148
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,468
to wait here for
Tonjit all alone?

149
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,305
We're taking all
your friends with us.

150
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,340
[NOMAD MAN B]
Littonto, wait, come back!

151
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,342
[NOMAD MAN A]
Please, come with us, Shelly.

152
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,645
We won't return to
this island for 27 years.

153
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,512
You're going to be lonely

154
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,816
if you have to
stay here by yourself.

155
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,152
[NOMAD MAN A] We don't
know where Tonjit ran off to.

156
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,353
It's not worth waiting here.

157
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,721
He might be gone for good.

158
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,456
[LITTONTO]
I'm gonna stay here, too!

159
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,759
Grandpa's coming back,
I just know it!

160
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:46,860
Put me down!

161
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,363
I'm not gonna leave
Shelly and Grandpa all alone!

162
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,398
Stop! Let me go!

163
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,265
Grandpa's coming back!

164
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,369
I know it! We have
to wait for him!!

165
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,670
[NOMAD MAN A]
Good luck, old girl.

166
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,239
Live well.

167
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:00,674
[LITTONTO]
Shelly!

168
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,211
[sad neighing]

169
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:14,087
[patter of rain]

170
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,373
[happy neighing]

171
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,677
Whoa, hold on there, Shelly!

172
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,580
You know this old man's
afraid of heights, don't you?

173
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,248
Hahahaha!

174
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,318
[ALL laugh]

175
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,272
[loud gunshot]

176
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,582
Oh no!

177
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,082
Are you okay?!

178
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,185
[pained grunting]

179
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,421
[frantic neighing]

180
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,522
Huh?

181
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,629
[USOPP]
Shelly! What happened?!

182
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,664
[CHOPPER]
We heard a gunshot!

183
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,440
[USOPP]
What's with this net?!

184
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,507
Here! I'll get it!

185
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,778
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!

186
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,248
Sorry suckers, but
that horse is mine!

187
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,549
[PORCHE]
Yeah! You tell them, Boss!

188
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,185
Put those losers in their place!

189
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,654
Whoever you are, you'll pay!

190
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,775
Whoever you are, you'll pay!

191
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,611
[FOXY] "Whoever you
are?" You don't know?

192
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,314
[PORCHE]
My goodness! How rude!

193
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,784
[HAMBURG]
Puh-puh-puh-puh...

194
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,387
Don't tell me you've never
seen this face before!

195
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,088
The only thing
I know about your face

196
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,125
is that I'm gonna break it!

197
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,660
[FOXY]
He really doesn't know me.

198
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,461
[PORCHE] Oh no,
don't get depressed, Boss!

199
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,430
He's just saying
that! It's a joke!

200
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,065
Everybody knows who you are!

201
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,333
[HAMBURG] Like he'd have
any reason to know him!

202
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,537
[PORCHE] You're gonna
make him cry, Hamburg!

203
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,573
My name is Foxy!

204
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:49,243
What's mine is mine and
what's yours is mine, too!

205
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,745
Feh-feh! You should see
the looks on your dumb faces!

206
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,347
What kind of pansy
gets so worked up

207
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,748
over some stupid horse?

208
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,250
If I didn't steal
that thing myself,

209
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,085
then somebody
else would do it!

210
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:01,388
[LUFFY]
That's enough! Gum-gum...

211
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,091
Hold it, Luffy, not yet!

212
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,460
Huh? How'd you know
my name was Luffy?

213
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,530
[FOXY] Because unlike some
people, we did our homework!

214
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,700
[PORCHE] Monkey D. Luffy,
with a 100 million Berry bounty.

215
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,769
Roronoa Zoro, with
a 60 million bounty.

216
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,239
A lump of cash like that
is nothing to scoff at,

217
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,640
especially considering
that you only have

218
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,408
seven crew members.

219
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,544
Now, with introductions
out of the way,

220
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,145
as Captain of the Foxy Pirates,

221
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,681
I challenge you Straw Hats
to a "Davy Back Fight!"

222
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,049
I don't know
what that means,

223
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,051
but if you want a
fight, bring it on!

224
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm sick of hearing you talk!

225
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,056
Huh? Wait! Now it
all makes sense!

226
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,058
I bet that messed up crew
we saw on the way here

227
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,794
got challenged to a
Davy Back Fight, too!

228
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:43,831
Which way do we turn?!

229
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:44,665
Who knows?!

230
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,234
Where's the navigator?!
Give orders!

231
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,402
--What navigator?!
--What navigator?!

232
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,470
Captain!

233
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,639
--What captain?!
--What captain?!

234
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:55,643
This's bad I got to
stop him! Luffy, no!

235
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,645
We're gonna end
up losing our crew!

236
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,146
What're you
talking about Usopp?

237
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,681
I know this guy is a jerk,

238
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,483
but you can't
agree to fight him!

239
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:05,219
[FOXY]
Hoi-hoi-hoi! Feh-feh-feh...

240
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,621
Aw, too bad kid,
but no take-backs!

241
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,323
You already agreed, remember?

242
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,091
"Bring it on,"
I believe you said.

243
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,426
Ain't that right, Porche?

244
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,095
Oh, that was definitely
a "bring it on" I heard!

245
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,330
And once you
say, "bring it on,"

246
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,832
there's no turning
back, that's the rule.

247
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,134
Should have kept
your mouth shut.

248
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,570
What's wrong?

249
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:25,372
Don't tell me you aren't
man enough to keep your word?

250
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,140
Am too!

251
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,343
You're falling into his trap!

252
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,412
But what about
the horse?! Come on!

253
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,247
Shelly.

254
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,515
You landed on your
back pretty hard!

255
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,616
Don't push yourself too much!

256
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,357
[TONJIT]
Both of you step aside!

257
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,624
Are you crazy?!

258
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,629
[TONJIT] Shelly waited 10
years for me to come back!

259
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,431
I won't let you take her!

260
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:54,234
I know that you're angry,
but those are pirates, old man!

261
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,638
You said the fight's
already started?

262
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,505
[FOXY CREW A]
That's right!

263
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,140
A Davy Back Fight
begins as soon as

264
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,542
one captain
accepts the challenge

265
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,777
from the other captain.
No take-backs!

266
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,644
[FOXY CREW B]
In other words,

267
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,213
your captain is
fighting our captain,

268
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,514
whether you like it or not!

269
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,717
All you can do is sit
back and deal with it!

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,718
I don't get this.

271
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:13,320
If it's a fight, why do
I have to sit and wait?

272
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,456
Let's do this right
here, right now.

273
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,691
[SANJI sighs]
You don't know anything, do you?

274
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:18,959
It's not a real fight.

275
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:22,096
It's more like a sports match
between different pirate crews.

276
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,097
[ZORO]
Hmm?

277
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,132
[ROBIN] Exactly.
Supposedly, the game originated

278
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,534
in a faraway place
called "Pirate Island."

279
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,535
As the name implies,

280
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,071
it's a sort of secret
paradise for pirates.

281
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,507
At any rate, the main
purpose of a Davy Back Fight

282
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,276
is to plunder
desirable members

283
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,111
from another pirate's crew.

284
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,313
[NAMI] Pirates
plundering other pirates?

285
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,347
Yes.

286
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,615
[FOXY CREW A] No wonder
your puny little crew

287
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,217
only has seven members!

288
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,685
A Davy Back Fight
is the best way

289
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,220
to pull in some new recruits!

290
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,154
[FOXY CREW B]
Since you're so clueless,

291
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,055
I'll tell you how it works.

292
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,757
After each match,
the winner can take

293
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,159
any crew member they
want from the losing team.

294
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,494
And once that
person is chosen,

295
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,396
they got to pledge
their undying loyalty

296
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,164
to their new captain,
on the spot.

297
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,599
Both crews take their oath

298
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,535
in the name of Davy Jones,
the Pirate of the Deep.

299
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,204
So if you lose, you
lose a crew member?

300
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,073
[FOXY CREW A]
Now you're getting it!

301
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,441
[FOXY CREW B]
Also, if the losing team

302
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,476
doesn't have any
members worth plundering,

303
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,812
the winning captain
can add insult to injury

304
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,349
by robbing the ship
of its Jolly Roger!

305
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,117
[SANJI] So you're not
just betting your crewmates,

306
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,786
but the pride
of your ship, too.

307
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,220
Winning might
make you stronger

308
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,190
but losing can leave
you with nothing at all.

309
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,259
Might as well be
betting your life.

310
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,328
I see, that explains it.

311
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,397
That ship without a captain
or a navigator or sail,

312
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,467
they must've lost everything
in a Davy Back Fight.

313
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,070
Oh? So you saw the
Fang-Frog Pirates

314
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,404
or what's left
of them at least.

315
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,639
How about we
give you a chance

316
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,741
to admire our
handiwork in person?

317
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,509
Here! Let's have a
round of applause

318
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,311
for our brand new recruits!

319
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,614
[FORMER CAPTAIN]
Long live the Foxy Pirates!

320
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,581
Before I came here,

321
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,783
I was the Captain of
the Fang-Frog Pirates!

322
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,151
I was the doctor.

323
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,186
I was the navigator.

324
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,687
And I was the shipwright!

325
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,357
We played five three-coin
games, and lost them all!

326
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,725
The captain,
thirteen crew members

327
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,427
and our Jolly
Roger, taken away!

328
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,196
[FORMER CREW B] With so
many people jumping ship,

329
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,298
I guess it was more like
a merger than anything!

330
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,800
[FORMER CREW MEMBERS laugh]

331
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,169
What about your crew,
huh? You don't care?

332
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,672
Just join a new ship
and leave them out to dry?

333
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,873
Yeah, no kidding.

334
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,176
Those poor saps got a one-way
ticket to a watery grave.

335
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,344
Watery grave?

336
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,613
That's their problem.
Don't look at me!

337
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,614
You're nothing but scum.

338
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,417
We're not playing
your stupid game, got it?

339
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,386
There's no way we'd
ever sink to your level!

340
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,121
[FOXY CREW A] You can
say that all you want,

341
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,789
but it ain't the
crew's decision to make!

342
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,392
The Davy Back Fight begins
the second one captain

343
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,427
agrees to another
captain's challenge.

344
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,294
[FOXY CREW B]
What's the matter?

345
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,463
Don't you have
faith in your captain?

346
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,399
If you don't agree with
the decisions he makes,

347
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,501
maybe you're better off
joining us after all!

348
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,338
[SANJI]
Sorry Nami, but they're right.

349
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,806
Huh?

350
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,341
All pirates take
an unwritten oath

351
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,443
to follow their captain
to the bitter end.

352
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,345
If we turned our back
on this fight now,

353
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,148
we'd be sailing
away in disgrace.

354
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,152
So? Who cares?
That's better than losing!

355
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,086
Maybe for you,

356
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:02,323
but I'd rather die
than live in disgrace.

357
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,724
The same goes for me.

358
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:07,094
[NAMI] Are you kidding?!
Get over yourself!

359
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,395
You know how men can be.

360
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,631
There's no point in
arguing with them.

361
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,534
UGH! I'll stop Luffy
by force if I have to!

362
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,536
Don't bother.
It's too late.

363
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,204
All that's left
now is to sit back

364
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,206
and wait for the
captains to fire a shot

365
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,508
to signal the
beginning of the match!

366
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,610
[gunshot]

367
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,211
[gasps]

368
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,448
Ah, no way.

369
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,817
Hhh... Guess that settles it.

370
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,785
Well, I'm
not complaining.

371
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,787
Should be interesting at least.

372
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,190
[FOXY CREW E]
He's agreed to the game!

373
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,158
[FOXY CREW chears]
Yay!!

374
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:47,201
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!

375
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,104
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

376
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:50,905
Why did you agree?!

377
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,339
You could end up
losing your crew!

378
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,707
You could lose me!

379
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,243
[LUFFY] Nuh-uh! I'm
gonna win this thing!

380
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:00,114
[FOXY] Now the Davy Back
Fight is officially underway!

381
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,150
[LUFFY] Good! The sooner I can
pound your face in, the better!

382
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,552
[FOXY] Feh-feh-feh...
I'd like to see you try!

383
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,188
All right! Bring
it on, Split-Head!

384
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,823
[FOXY]
He doesn't like my haircut.

385
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:13,093
[PORCHE] That's not true!
Hey! Apologize to him!

386
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,162
Our boss is sensitive
about his looks!

387
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,830
[HAMBURG] He's sensitive
about everything.

388
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:20,234
He's got a heart of glass.
Puh-puh-puh...

389
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:23,270
[PORCHE] How many times do
I have to tell you, don't laugh!

390
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,172
Luffy, now listen, I'm as angry

391
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,507
about the old guy's
horse as you are,

392
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,242
but this is madness.

393
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,277
Good! Use that
anger to thrash 'em!

394
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,245
What're you doing up?!

395
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,212
I thought you hurt your back!

396
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,447
Leave it to me!

397
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:39,787
You don't know what
you're getting into.

398
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,291
[fireworks booms]

399
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,225
[FOXY CREW F]
Sausage on a stick!

400
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,461
Get your sausage on
a stick! We got rum!

401
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,796
We got cheese burgers!

402
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:51,365
Turkey legs,
yakisoba we got it all!

403
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,767
[ITOMIMIZU] It's time
for the opening ceremonies!

404
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,036
Everybody simmer
down, simmer down,

405
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:56,670
simmer down, simmer
down, simmer down,

406
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,604
simmer down, simmer down!

407
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,206
[FOXY CREW I]
C'mon, let's hear the odds!

408
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,508
[FOXY CREW B]
All competitors get ready!

409
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,576
Split-head
may be a jerk,

410
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,144
but he sure
knows how to party!

411
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,646
And check out all
the people he invited!

412
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,647
Is that his crew?

413
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,383
Wow! There's so many!

414
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,718
[TONJIT]
Five jumbo yakisobas, please.

415
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,120
Whose side are you on, huh?

416
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,624
Now, let's calm down, boys!

417
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,758
We're about to start!

418
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,159
[FOXY CREW G]
I love you Porche!

419
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,093
[FOXY CREW H]
Marry me!

420
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,161
Since our challengers
have never played

421
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,565
this game before,
let's go over the rules, 'kay?

422
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,667
First of all, whatever you
lose in one of the matches,

423
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,335
whether it's your
crew, your Jolly Roger,

424
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,704
or anything else the
only way you can take it

425
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:34,208
back is with another
Davy Back Fight.

426
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,643
Second, any crew member taken

427
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,645
by the winner must
swear undying loyalty

428
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:41,115
to their new captain on
the spot, no exceptions.

429
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:43,250
Third, if your
Jolly Roger is taken,

430
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,653
you can't ever fly
it again! Never ever!

431
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,289
Nami! I got you
some cotton candy!

432
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:49,823
I don't know how
everyone can be so calm

433
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,791
at a time like this!

434
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:53,927
It's already settled,

435
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:55,729
so you might as
well stop complaining.

436
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,265
Finally, if you happen to
break any of these rules,

437
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,234
you'll be labeled a
disgrace to all pirates,

438
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,269
and banished to
Davy Jones' Locker!

439
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,071
So do you swear to uphold them?

440
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:05,272
I swear.

441
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,040
I swear!

442
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:08,642
[CROWD cheers]

443
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,247
All right then, Straw Hat.

444
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,115
I'll let you
choose your fate.

445
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,085
One coin? Two coins?
Three coins?

446
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,420
It's all up to you, kid!

447
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,822
That's our boss for you!
Always a good sport!

448
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,058
Feh-feh-feh-feh!!

449
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,225
What do the coins do?

450
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,627
Decide the number of games.

451
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,728
The boss is letting
you choose how many

452
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,463
matches you want to have.

453
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:31,065
You can quit after
one, or you can do

454
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,466
as many as three if
you're feeling lucky.

455
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,202
Well, the more games we do

456
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,471
the more fun we'll
have, right? So let's...

Huh?

459
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,146
Got it!

460
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,216
'Kay! Then I'll take three!

461
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,054
[USOPP and NAMI] You idiot!
Why did you add them?!

462
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,656
And why'd you
count an enemy, too?!

463
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:59,226
That was easy!
Puh-puh-puh...

464
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,160
Then it's settled!

465
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,697
Three coins, three
games, orthodox rules!

466
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,067
Let Davy Jones be our witness!

467
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,743
Huh? So who's
this Davy Jones guy?

468
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,778
[ROBIN] A pirate who
was cursed by the devil

469
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,480
and forced to
spend all of eternity

470
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,048
at the bottom of the sea.

471
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,150
I've never heard of
people living underwater!

472
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,718
Well, that's what
the legend says.

473
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,487
And all the ships
and treasures that sink

474
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,555
beneath the waves
go to his "locker,"

475
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,258
never to be seen
by anyone again.

476
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,195
I knew the ocean was scary,
but that's crazy! Yummy!

477
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,730
Davy Jones has
been taking his picks

478
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,399
from all sorts of
pirates for as long as

479
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,100
anyone can remember.

480
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,136
That's why we call
it a "Davy Back Fight"

481
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,637
in honor of the
pirate that may someday

482
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,605
claim your crew as his own.

483
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,443
[FOXY] The stage of
battle is set, Straw Hat!
