00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.751
My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:34.288
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:36.158
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.296
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.839
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:37.882
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.788
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:46.066
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.169
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:51.810
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.119
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.690
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.497
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.836
became rubber after eating

sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:13.152

[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:18.664
one of the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.869
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:22.104
Their current objective

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:24.510
is to destroy a man-made
Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:26.112
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:27.949
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:30.320
that promised the Flame-Flame
fruit to the champion,

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.695
but abandoned that plan when Law
was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.265
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:39.405
As Luffy waits for Usopp
to finish Operation S.O.P.

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:42.845
with the Tontatta,
Kyros reflects on his past.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:47.388
[KYROS panting]

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:49.559
He could attack! Step away!

00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:51.964
Be careful, my lord!

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.357
[DOLDO] Here again, Kyros?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.158
Listen.

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.096
[KYROS]
Go away!

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.606
Don't you understand?
No matter where I go,

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.979
for the rest of my life,
I'll be a beast.

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:17.782
A murderer!

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:30.073
I wish ...this world...

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:32.612
...would forget about me!

Her name is Rebecca.

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:40.026
I shouldn't touch
such an innocent thing!

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.498
Not with these tainted hands.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:43.601
It's not right!

00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:45.772
[SCARLET chuckles]
Your father's a strange man.

You're such a little
angel, aren't you?

00:04:52.653 --> 00:04:54.122
I'll watch over you.

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:56.893
I'll always be at your side!

00:05:05.143 --> 00:05:09.553
A fire? What happened?

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:14.194

The royal palace--it's on fire!

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:36.138

Our kingdom's falling apart!

[KYROS]
I'm going to the palace.

00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.466
Scarlet, Rebecca,
I need you to stay safe.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:07.736
Okay, Daddy.

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:09.706
If it gets too
dangerous here, leave.

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:12.311
Wait for me in
the Red Flower Field.

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:15.083

[KYROS]
Let me in! It's me, Kyros!

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.470

It's too much.

Would you like to pay your
respects to the new king?

and she's waiting for me.

00:16:35.924 --> 00:16:36.793
[SCARLET]
Please...

00:16:36.826 --> 00:16:39.264
It's Kyros! I'm your husband!

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:41.234
I beg you--

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:48.248
[gasps]

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:50.621
[KYROS]
Scarlet?

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:52.691
Scarlet!

00:16:53.794 --> 00:17:00.073
[sobbing]

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:04.682
Scarlet!

00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:06.519
[KYROS]
How did it come to this?

00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:07.755
I've lost her.

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:09.124
She's gone.

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:11.529
This is hell!

00:17:11.562 --> 00:17:14.334
These useless tin arms of mine.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:18.408
I can't even feel your
warmth one last time!

00:17:21.448 --> 00:17:29.665
[KYROS]
Scarlet!

00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:34.708
[VIOLET]
Soldier.

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:36.513
[VIOLET]
Soldier!

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:37.915
[gasps]

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:38.751
Are you all right?

00:17:38.784 --> 00:17:41.388
Huh? Yes, it's nothing.

00:17:41.421 --> 00:17:43.259
You having a bad dream, or what?

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:44.394
Listen.

00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:46.799
We have a problem.
There are enemies on the way.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:48.201
Oh!

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:52.745
[GLADIUS]
Unforgivable!

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:55.918
How dare he pretend
to be the young master?!

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:57.353
Straw Hat and his
friends must have

00:17:57.386 --> 00:17:58.890
made it past the second floor!

00:17:58.923 --> 00:18:00.794
Violet's blood was on the wall!

00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:02.330
It's no good.

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:06.304
[KYROS] At this rate,
we'll be completely surrounded.

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:10.814
Is it better to make a surprise
attack on Doflamingo now?

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:14.922
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yelling]

00:18:14.955 --> 00:18:16.826
[KYROS]
Hm.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.464
[KYROS] Usoland and the
others must have failed.

00:18:21.502 --> 00:18:23.205
I was wondering, Straw Hat.

00:18:23.238 --> 00:18:25.911
Are all of your friends pirates?

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:29.552
I realized that
Fraland and Usoland are.

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.054
That a problem for you?

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:33.125
No, I'm a criminal myself.

00:18:33.159 --> 00:18:36.164
I'm just grateful that
we share a common goal.

00:18:36.197 --> 00:18:39.705
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.112
[clang, rumbling]

00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:46.451
Those cracks in the
ceiling're freaking me out.

00:18:46.484 --> 00:18:48.021
That's what happens
when you have hundreds

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:50.927
of powerful fighters all
competing in the same event.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.396
It's no surprise
that the structure

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.967
has taken so much damage.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.004
That Burgess guy's
outta control!

00:18:56.037 --> 00:18:58.543
He's gonna bring
the place crashing down!

00:18:58.577 --> 00:19:01.381
And Shockwave Elbow!

00:19:01.414 --> 00:19:03.452
[CROWD screams]

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:07.059
[BURGESS]
Elbow! Elbow!

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:13.205
[GUARDS gasp]

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:14.609
Cut that out!

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:20.587
Stop shooting us!

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.523
You're funny.

00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:22.991
[BURGESS]
Huh?

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:25.163
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]

00:19:25.196 --> 00:19:28.669
If you don't believe me,
I'll tell you again, Rebecca.

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:32.377
I'm the one who shot and
killed your mother, Scarlet.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.413
I would've killed you, too!

00:19:34.447 --> 00:19:35.784
[BARTOLOMEO]
My barrier only protects

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.523
against physical attacks,
not verbal ones!

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:40.560
[REBECCA]
Soldier.

00:19:40.593 --> 00:19:43.131
I-I can't do it.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:45.671
[REBECCA]
I'm so hungry.

00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:47.440
Mother, I'm starving!

00:19:47.473 --> 00:19:49.177
[SCARLET] I'm going to
bring us something to eat.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.980
[REBECCA gasps]
Really?

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:55.857
[REBECCA]
I'm too angry to even move!

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.795
Cyborg Franky's down!
I think we're done here!

00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:16.599
[FRANKY groans]

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.237
[FRANKY]
Usopp. I'm countin' on you, bro.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.143
I know you're gonna start
that riot any second now.

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.278
You got this!

00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:27.854
[DWARVES] Usoland, go!
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:34.669
Special Attack:
Green Star Rapid Fire!

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:36.873
[TREBOL laughing]

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:40.380
[yells]

00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:41.683
And, uh,

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.687
Don't-Know-What-To-Call-It-But-
Some-Kind-Of-Special-Attack!

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.122
[yells]

00:20:49.698 --> 00:20:52.070
[TOY MAN A] They're going
nuts at the Executive Tower!

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:53.607
[TOY MAN B]
He said his name was Usopp?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.808
Of the Straw Hats?

00:20:54.842 --> 00:20:55.877
Good luck!

00:20:55.911 --> 00:20:57.380
[TOY MAN C] I don't even
know what you look like,

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:58.983
but I'm cheering for you, Usopp!

00:20:59.017 --> 00:21:01.254
You'll be my hero
forever if you win!

00:21:01.287 --> 00:21:02.290
[TOY MAN D]
You can do it!

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:03.391
[TOY MAN E]
You can do it!

00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:05.262
[CAVENDISH]
Being a toy is awful!

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:06.532
If you can fix this,

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:08.970
I promise I'll give up my
grudge against Straw Hat! Deal?

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:11.007
[HAJRUDIN] I'll be your flunky,
or whatever you want!

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.343
Just get this done!

00:21:12.377 --> 00:21:16.084
[DAGAMA] You can have all of my
money! No price is too great!

00:21:21.629 --> 00:21:22.664
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hey, Trebol.

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.467
Bring Sugar to the palace
and make it quick!

00:21:24.502 --> 00:21:28.242
[TREBOL chuckles]
Take it easy, Doffy!

00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:29.444
They tried to pull something,

00:21:29.478 --> 00:21:31.448
but I've got it all
under control now!

00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.086
[groans]

00:21:36.893 --> 00:21:38.964
I'm fine, Young Master.

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:42.003
The enemy's barely even
conscious anymore.

00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:42.705
[groans]

00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:44.809
Usoland, wake up!

00:21:44.842 --> 00:21:47.714
[groans]

00:21:50.353 --> 00:21:53.191
Why don't you take this
poison grape of yours back?

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:56.666
[COTTON cries]
That's our only hope!

00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:59.505
The Tatababasco grape!

00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:01.876
[SUGAR]
It's better if you eat it.

00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:12.898
Drop dead, will you?

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.133
[USOPP grunts]

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:23.619
[USOPP gulps]

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:31.736
[screaming]

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:35.877
[SUGAR screams]

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.920
[ALL screaming]

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:51.709
[SUGAR continues screaming]

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:54.748
Calm down, Sugar!
Everything's all right!

00:22:54.781 --> 00:22:57.921
Please don't pass
out on me, okay?

00:23:01.562 --> 00:23:04.067
Look! Usoland did it!

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.339
Sugar passed out!

00:23:14.822 --> 00:23:17.493
[NARRATOR] Against all odds,
Usopp made a miracle happen.

00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:19.598
Toys are turning
back into humans,

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:22.003
throwing Dressrosa into chaos.

00:23:22.036 --> 00:23:25.878
Before Doflamingo can react,
the undefeated gladiator, Kyros,

00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:28.248
pours his heart and
soul into an attack

00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:30.052
many years in the making.

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:31.722
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:35.563
"The Legend is Back!
Kyros' All-out Blow!"

00:23:35.596 --> 00:23:38.301
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
