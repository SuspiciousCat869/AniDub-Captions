1
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:02,093
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:05,180
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,557
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,187
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,148
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,359
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:25,658
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,161
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,872 --> 00:01:35,710
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:38,213
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,840
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,941
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,985
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,488
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:08,201
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,995
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,289
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:18,795
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,059
[USOPP]
What was the noise?

30
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:37,272
Shh!

31
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,524
[NARRATOR] After the campfire
celebration, Usopp witnessed

32
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:42,318
an eerie sight late that
night on the Going Merry,

33
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,903
[USOPP whimpers]

34
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,531
[screams

35
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:53,121
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the
priests, Ohm, Gedatsu and Shura

36
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:54,831
were summoned to God's Shrine.

37
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,292
Surprise, boys!

38
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,502
[yelling]

39
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:03,923
[NARRATOR] Where Eneru
himself appeared before them.

40
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07,469
[yelling]

41
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:13,767
[ENERU]
The rules state that each of you

42
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,102
run an area of the Upperyard.

43
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:19,064
Tomorrow, I'll allow you
to go where you will.

44
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:23,443
There will be no restrictions.
Get as vicious as you like.

45
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:31,951
C'mon, Merry,
just tell me who I saw.

46
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,374
[ZORO] Okay, we'll all meet
safely on the east coast.

47
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,501
[USOPP]
You bet!

48
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,211
[LUFFY]
Let's get going, then!

49
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,712
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

50
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,467
[LUFFY]
"A Giant Snake Bears Its Fangs!

51
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,803
The Survival Game Begins!"

52
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,525
Hey! That's the wrong way, Zoro!

53
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,360
We're supposed to be going west!

54
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:07,362
You know, west? This way!

55
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,364
Jeez, I can't believe
your sense of direction!

56
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,825
But he's going east!

57
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,702
Aw, come on, Luffy,
use your head for something

58
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,704
besides a hat rack,
for a change.

59
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,580
We're supposed to go
to the skull's right eye,

60
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,666
so we gotta go right,
you rubber brain!

61
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,085
They've both lost their minds.

62
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,045
Why don't you go tell
those two heroes that

63
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,923
we're supposed to be heading
south before they end up lost.

64
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,967
Sure thing, Robin.

65
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,178
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

66
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,639
[CHOPPER]
Luffy! Zoro! Wait up, guys!

67
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:39,310
[LUFFY] South, huh?
You should've said so sooner!

68
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,695
[LUFFY humming]

69
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:56,161
[CHOPPER] Luffy, that's a pretty
neat stick you got there!

70
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,705
[LUFFY laughs]
Isn't it? It's mine, though.

71
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,999
You gotta get your own!

72
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:04,669
[CHOPPER]
Aw... I want one.

73
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:06,171
Stick! Stick!

74
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:08,673
What's up with sticks?

75
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:11,718
[CHOPPER] You know, I thought
this forest would be scarier,

76
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,888
but so far, it's been
nice and peaceful!

77
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,099
[laughs]

78
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:20,977
Hey, Chopper, you're in
a pretty good mood today!

79
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,896
Are you feeling
courageous for a change?

80
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:23,980
Yep, you betcha!

81
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,982
[laughs]

82
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:29,069
[CHOPPER]
I feel so safe with these guys!

83
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,695
Yeah, you're right.

84
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:33,031
This forest really has been
a big disappointment.

85
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:35,617
Nothing but birds and trees
for two whole days!

86
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,952
Makes me wanna scream;
I'm so bored.

87
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,455
We haven't even seen
one of Eneru's priests,

88
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:43,124
so I know exactly
how you feel, Chopper.

89
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,167
Do you?

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,378
[laughs

91
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,380
Just listen to the two of you!

92
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,965
Are you that eager for
something dangerous to happen?

93
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,843
[laughs]

94
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,472
[gasps]

95
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:00,934
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

96
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:04,187
Where did that weird stripey
looking root come from?

97
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,772
[gasps]
It's moving!

98
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,816
[LUFFY] What do you see
back there, Chopper?

99
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,861
[CHOPPER] Oh! Uh, it's nothing
really, nothing at all.

100
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,530
[CHOPPER] If I tell them
I saw a moving root,

101
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,116
they'll laugh at me for
getting scared over nothing.

102
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,118
I'm supposed to be brave today.

103
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,704
It was probably
my imagination anyway.

104
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:24,165
[birds chirping]

105
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:27,002
[ROBIN] There's something
eerie about this place.

106
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:29,546
[CHOPPER whimpers]

107
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,965
[ZORO] Chopper! Why do you
keep looking behind us?

108
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:35,719
[CHOPPER gasps]
No reason! No reason at all!

109
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:39,222
Whoa, get a load of that weird
stripey-looking root back there.

110
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,975
Oh, that? So,
you guys can see it?

111
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:44,644
I've never heard
of roots moving before.

112
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,521
Oh, no! You see that, too?

113
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:49,065
I thought I was
just imagining things!

114
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,402
Huh?

115
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:58,283
--Ah! What's that?
--What in the hell?

116
00:06:58,366 --> 00:06:59,743
[PYTHON growls]

117
00:06:59,826 --> 00:07:02,162
[screams]

118
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:05,290
[roars]

119
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:14,758
[USOPP]
Wind, good! Helm, good!

120
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:18,470
Hmm. This is so nice. It's
just like a pleasure cruise!

121
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,180
But we're making bad time!

122
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,723
Navigator! Pick up the pace!

123
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,683
[NAMI] I'm afraid we can't,
Captain Usopp!

124
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:24,726
[USOPP]
Say that again.

125
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,311
[NAMI]
I'm afraid we can't!

126
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:27,979
[USOPP]
No, the Captain part.

127
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,607
[NAMI] The Milky Road gets
pretty steep in places,

128
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,443
so we have to rely on
dial power to get by!

129
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,236
[USOPP]
Pour it on, little Crow!

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,697
Sanji! You are
my official bodyguard!

131
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:40,950
The captain is afraid
of this creepy forest.

132
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,827
Come on, for crying out loud,

133
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,163
knock it off with the
"bold Captain" business!

134
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:48,208
The only person I'm planning on
protecting is my little Nami!

135
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,335
Hey! It's about time
for that weird knight's

136
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,878
medicine, isn't it?

137
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:53,797
Do you remember where Chopper
said he was going to put it?

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,299
[GAN FALL] Excuse me dear,
my name is Gan Fall.

139
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,842
That's Gan Fall.

140
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:00,136
[SANJI] Oh, yeah, that's right,
I think he left it sitting

141
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,598
on a barrel down in the galley.
Can you grab it, Nami-sweet?

142
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:04,974
[NAMI]
Sure thing!

143
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,686
Heh. Well, well old man,
looks like you're better.

144
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,938
[GAN FALL] Mm. I'm very
grateful to you all.

145
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,774
Hey, if anyone deserves
thanks, it's our ship's doctor!

146
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:14,651
When it comes to medicine,
that Chopper is

147
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,445
a real miracle worker,
there's no doubt about it!

148
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,072
But now that I think about it,

149
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,616
you saved Chopper from
that priest guy, didn't you?

150
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,201
So I guess you're even, then!

151
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:24,494
[laughs]

152
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,290
Old man?

153
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:33,670
[GAN FALL] Shall I tell you
a little of this land's history?

154
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:34,838
[USOPP]
Hm?

155
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:41,011
[GAN FALL]
Until six years ago, I was God.

156
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,263
[USOPP] Uh, did you hit
your head, old man?

157
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,224
[yells]

158
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,811
[GAN FALL]
As you have no doubt learned,

159
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,188
it is believed that the
Upper Yard first appeared

160
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:57,402
in Skypiea abruptly,
a good 400 years ago.

161
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:00,030
Until then, Skypiea
had always been

162
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:02,073
a peaceful sky island.

163
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:07,162
[GAN FALL] Items from the
Blue Sea that were occasionally

164
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:09,873
brought here by the Knock-Up
Stream were rare

165
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,917
and valuable treasures
to the sky people.

166
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:15,920
Likewise, all of the
Vearth on the sky islands

167
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:18,089
was brought here by
the Knock-Up Stream.

168
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:23,011
[GAN FALL] But a quantity of
Vearth as vast as the Upper Yard

169
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:27,307
appearing in the sky seemed
like an unimaginable miracle.

170
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,648
[GAN FALL] The sky people
were understandably overjoyed

171
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,776
and worshipped it
as holy ground.

172
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,403
A gift from Heaven itself.

173
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,906
[USOPP]
Hmm...

174
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:45,075
[GAN FALL] But the original
inhabitants were still on

175
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:50,288
that Vearth and a war
erupted over its possession.

176
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:53,833
Those inhabitants
were the Shandorians.

177
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,586
--Then they're the guerillas?
--[GAN FALL] Mm-hmm.

178
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,255
So you're saying the
Shandorians used to live on Jaya

179
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,091
when it was still
in the Blue Sea?

180
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:02,634
[GAN FALL]
That's right.

181
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,928
The current blasted them into
the sky against their will.

182
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:07,347
Hold on, does that mean
that you just stole the land

183
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,307
that was rightfully theirs?

184
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,767
[GAN FALL]
It does.

185
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,770
The sky people's greed
drove them to steal

186
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,689
the Shandorians' homeland.

187
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,233
[GAN FALL]
And for the last 400 years,

188
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,902
the war between the
Shandorians and the sky people

189
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,904
has gone on without a break.

190
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:25,031
The Shandorians are
simply trying to regain

191
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,741
their lost home.

192
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,119
How sad. All those lives lost.

193
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,621
[BOTH] Wait a second, doesn't
that make you the bad guys?!

194
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,457
--[PIERRE growls]
--[BOTH scream]

195
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:38,086
[GAN FALL] I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid that's correct.

196
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,882
[GAN FALL]
Oh, my medicine.

197
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,593
Excuse me, I almost
forgot to take it.

198
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,888
[USOPP whimpers]

199
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,392
What about... Eneru.

200
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,810
[GAN FALL grunts]

201
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,104
Who's he? What's his story?

202
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:03,111
[GAN FALL]
While I was still God,

203
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:05,280
he appeared from
another sky island,

204
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,282
leading a group of warriors.

205
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,784
They dealt a heavy blow
to my Divine Squad

206
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,536
and to the Shandorians.

207
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,330
Then they seized control
of the Upper Yard.

208
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,291
That was six years ago.

209
00:11:16,374 --> 00:11:18,960
Since then, nearly all
the Divine Squad have been

210
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:22,380
enslaved and forced to perform
some mysterious labor.

211
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:25,258
I don't know what it is.

212
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,386
But the Shandorians
don't care who God is.

213
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,347
They want what they've
always wanted:

214
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,390
the return of their homeland.

215
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,312
Yeah, right, if all these
Shandorians are interested in

216
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,897
is getting their
homeland back,

217
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,442
then why did they attack us
the minute we showed up?

218
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:04,172
[GAN FALL] The Members of the
Divine Squad sometimes steal

219
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,592
a ship in hopes that they
might escape from Eneru.

220
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,886
However, the Shandorians
still consider

221
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,554
the Divine Squad enemies.

222
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:13,807
And they will eliminate
them on sight.

223
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,685
They must have
mistaken you for them.

224
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:20,522
[SANJI] Oh, of course.
That makes it all better.

225
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,400
[GAN FALL] One reason I became
the Sky Knight was to help

226
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:28,029
these escapees make it safely
away to other sky islands.

227
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:30,782
There is no place on the
Upper Yard that such outlaws

228
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,992
would be able to
avoid Eneru's eye.

229
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:34,494
To hear the way you tell it,

230
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,706
this Eneru guy sounds like
he must be the devil himself.

231
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,374
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

232
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,042
For all we know, he's out
there right now listening

233
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,961
to every word we're say
and taking notes!

234
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,295
Notes! Notes! Notes!

235
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,630
Oh, you've got to be kidding,

236
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,133
don't tell me you've suddenly
become a convert.

237
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:50,135
Hey! You heard
what the old man said.

238
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:51,678
Scary!

239
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:55,640
[GAN FALL] The devil himself?
No, but he comes very close.

240
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,186
[GAN FALL] Eneru has
decreed that all outsiders,

241
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,355
like yourselves, are criminals.

242
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,275
What's more, he has made
the inhabitants of Skypiea

243
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,986
responsible for leading
them to judgment.

244
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:15,744
[GAN FALL] This gives rise to
the islanders' sense of guilt.

245
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,415
[GAN FALL] When the people
believe they are committing

246
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:24,002
a criminal act, they
become overwhelmed by it.

247
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,046
It weakens their will.

248
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,715
Eneru knows this
and exploits it.

249
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:32,302
He has created a flock of
helpless lambs to rule over.

250
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:33,803
The lives of the people are like

251
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,515
playthings to him.
A devil indeed.

252
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,519
[NAMI]
Hmm...

253
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,438
When we landed
on Angel Beach,

254
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,982
we thought we'd found
something like a paradise.

255
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:47,734
Boy, were we wrong.

256
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,695
Of all the places
that ancient City of Gold

257
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,656
could've ended up being.
This is just our luck.

258
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,534
[GAN FALL]
Oh, that's right. This city...

259
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,788
You sure were excited about it.

260
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,664
But please tell me something.

261
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,208
What is "gold"?

262
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,501
[STRAW HATS gasp]

263
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:22,435
[WYPER]
You back again, old man?

264
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,606
Get out. Now!

265
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:32,112
[CHIEF] Enough, Wyper!
Gan Fall is here to negotiate!

266
00:14:32,195 --> 00:14:33,571
[WYPER]
Negotiate what?

267
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,448
No, Chief, we're through!

268
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:38,702
We're not going to stand by
while two old men negotiate away

269
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:42,122
everything we've fought
for our whole lives!

270
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:45,083
Listen, Gan Fall,
you can forget about

271
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,876
any kind of treaty.

272
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,839
If you want compromise
so badly then give it all back!

273
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:53,091
For generations,
we've watched you sky people

274
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,634
slaughter us like little pigs.

275
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,219
Enough!

276
00:14:56,302 --> 00:14:58,388
And now you're saying that
you want to make peace?!

277
00:14:58,471 --> 00:14:59,597
Ha!

278
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:02,142
I cannot give
it all back to you.

279
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,227
The power of the
Upper Yard's Vearth is of

280
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,813
the utmost importance
to every man and woman

281
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,441
now living in Skypiea.

282
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:12,777
All are grateful
for its many blessings.

283
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:15,321
I have no right
to take that away.

284
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:18,992
These people are,
after all, innocent.

285
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:21,995
Oh, so the sky people
are innocent, are they?

286
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,205
I guess you can call them that,
since they let you do

287
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:27,417
their fighting for them and
never bloody their own hands!

288
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,503
Maybe it's time we involved
a few "innocent" people!

289
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:31,921
I won't allow that!

290
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,258
[WYPER] You want peace
so badly, make a sacrifice!

291
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,302
Execute a hundred
of your own innocent people

292
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:39,846

bring us their heads!

done talking! Get lost!

you use my name, old man.

I really don't know
but you have to admit,

when there are
problems in the village,

319
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,722
he's right in the

Why? What do you
think of him, Laki?

Run for it! It's a giant snake!

341
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:30,058
[laughs]

342
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,562

[PYTHON growls]

344
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,567
It's enormous!

345
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,903
I wonder if it's another result
of the environment here.

346
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,321
[CHOPPER screams]

347
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:44,531
[LUFFY grunts]

[PYTHON growls]

350
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,206
Okay, catfish face, it's time
for you to get filleted!

351
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:54,249
[PYTHON roars]

352

[CHOPPER shrieks]

354
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,633
How in the hell
can something so big

355
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,468
move so freaking fast?

356
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:09,889
[PYTHON growls]

00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:26,656
[CHOPPER]
Ah! Acid!

360
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,993
Uh, change of plan--
we're running away.

361
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,286
Sounds good.

362
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,746
Yeah!

363
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:34,539
[laughs]

364
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,792
[PYTHON roars]

365
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,377
Don't let that venom touch you!

366
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,628
It's death!

367
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,844
[LUFFY bellows]

368
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:49,637
Hey, Mister Snake!

369
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,598
Over here! Follow me!

370
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,060
Better hurry up!
Your dinner's getting away!

371
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,853
[laughs]

372
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,231
[CHOPPER]
Robin! Look out!

373
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,110
[ROBIN]
Cinco Fleurs!

374
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:05,570
Ha! Nice try!

375
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,530
[CHOPPER]
That was awesome, Robin!

376
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,532
--[roars]
--[CHOPPER screams]

377
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,411
Good!

378
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,622
I finally managed to make
my way around the back of it.

379
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:21,044
[PYTHON slurps]

380
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,587
[ZORO gulps]
Crap.

381
00:20:23,296 --> 00:20:24,673
[PYTHON roars]

382
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,341
[ZORO yells]

[CHOPPER shrieks]

384
00:20:28,218 --> 00:20:31,680
[LUFFY]
This way, whiskers! Over here!

385
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,973
[laughs]

386
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,194
[ROBIN]
This is bad.

387
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:50,448
I know I'm on the right path,
but where is everyone?

388
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:53,243
Are they lost?
Should I wait for them?

389
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,958
[CHOPPER sobs]

390
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,544
I'm lost, guys! Wait for me!

391
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:05,213
[ZORO] Well, it figures,
I turn my back for one second

392
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,173
and they go and get lost on me.

393
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:10,427
Well, whatever, they know how
to take care of themselves.

394
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,804
I got most of the map
memorized anyway.

395
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,264
I go to the right.

396
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,059
[LUFFY sighs]
Now what?

397
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:20,478
Where did everybody go?

398
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:23,148
Did they get lost?
I better keep moving.

399
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,108
I'll catch up with them
later at the ruins.

400
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:27,736
Robin said we had to go south,
and it always gets warmer

401
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,197
when you go south.
So I go this way!

402
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:35,660
It looks like our
Shandorian friends

403
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,245
are making their move.

404
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:38,705
How nice.

405
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,208
And the Blue Sea dwellers
have split into two groups.

406
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:44,294
And then split up again.

407
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:45,795
That's interesting.

408
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,675
Today is certainly
shaping up to be

409
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,218
a very lively day.

410
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,846
I wonder how many of our
players will live till its end?

411
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:57,557
Well then, let the
survival game begin!

412
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,019
[laughs]

413
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,316
[WYPER]
Our objective is God's shrine!

414
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,526
Don't let anything
get in your way!

415
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,574
[WYPER] Our only goal
is to bring back his head!

416
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:16,993
[SHANDORIANS yell]

417
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:38,807
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

418
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,271
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

419
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:48,191
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

420
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:50,944
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

421
00:22:51,027 --> 00:22:54,823
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

422
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,869
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

423
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,790
<i>We will never yield</i>

424
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,667
<i>We won't back down</i>

425
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,962
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

426
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

427
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:18,930
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

428
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,350
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

429
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:30,233
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

430
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:45,582
[ENERU laughs]
How many will survive?

431
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:48,501
[CHOPPER]
Where is everyone? Help!

432
00:23:48,585 --> 00:23:50,670
[WYPER] If you want a shoulder,
you can have it!

433
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:52,922
[ZORO]
They always get lost without me!

434
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,799
[WYPER]
Eneru's head will be ours!

435
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,844
[ENERU] In three hours only
five will be left standing!

436
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,512
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

437
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:02,974
"The Deadly Reject!
War Demon Wyper's Resolve!"

438
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,518
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
