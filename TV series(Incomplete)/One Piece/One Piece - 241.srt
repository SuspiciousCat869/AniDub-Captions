In other words,
she'll murder him.

177
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,730
[ZORO] I think that's what she's
trying to tell us, at least.

178
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,533
Also since she told Chopper

179
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,268
that she'll be pinning
the crime on us,

180
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,404
it could be that she's feeding
us all these little hints

181
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,674
to try and lure us out
to the crime scene tonight.

182
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,641
Think so?

183
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,710
If that is her plan,
it would be convenient

184
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,645
for her if we did
happen to show up.

185
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,148
Since that would put us
at the scene of the crime.

186
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,583
You say you don't
know what she's thinking,

187
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:36,450
but it sound to me like you've

188
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:39,186
already decided
that she's our enemy!

189
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,455
I'm talking about
possibilities here, that's all.

190
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,389
We should always be prepared

191
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,259
for the worst-case
scenario, understand?

192
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,261
If I get locked into a
single line of thinking,

193
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:50,364
it'll only slow me down.
If she's my friend,

194
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,132
I have to be ready to forgive

195
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,069
but if she's my enemy
I have to be ready to fight.

196
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:04,044
Our best chance to settle
this is tonight. Are we going?

197
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,579
Of course.

198
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,157
It's not that
I object to the plan

199
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,660
but we're still
forgetting something.

200
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,428
Sanji said he saw Robin walking

201
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,064
with someone in
a mask, remember?

202
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,699
Obviously that wasn't one of us,

203
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,068
but Iceberg said
exactly the same thing.

204
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,202
That he was attacked by Robin

205
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,373
and a large man in a mask
that he didn't recognize.

206
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,742
Whoever he is,
I bet he's the reason

207
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,744
Robin is doing
all of this stuff.

208
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:38,245
Yeah! That means
it isn't her fault

209
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,814
and we just need to beat
the real bad guy. Right?

210
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,050
That's the ideal situation.

211
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,284
But on the other hand,

212
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,121
it's also possible that this
guy is one of Robin's friends.

213
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,789
The problem is we
don't have much to go

214
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,225
on other than
"a big man in a mask."

215
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,626
So where do we even start?

216
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,095
I mean, what is our goal here?

217
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,530
We find Robin and capture her.

218
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,076
[LUFFY] That's the only way
we'll ever know the truth.

219
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,077
[ZORO]
You're right.

220
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,313
We're wasting time here
trying to figure it out.

221
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,647
Just one thing.

222
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,150
Robin won't be easy to catch.

223
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,785
After all, the World
Government's been trying

224
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:21,488
for 20 years and it
still hasn't happened.

225
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,758
Like he said, it's the only
way we'll really know for sure.

226
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,762
Yeah. Let's settle
this right now!

227
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,331
[LUFFY]
Right.

228
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,066
Come on. Galley-La's waiting.

229
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,610
Damn. It's late.
Where'd Straw Hat run off to?

230
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,678
[CRAFTSMAN C]
Paulie! We gotta go!

231
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,348
All these streets are
gonna flood before long!

232
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,683
All right. Let's head back.

233
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,418
I'm going to the main office.

234
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,120
Sounds good, boss.

235
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,655
You heard him, guys,
time to move out!

236
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:01,262
[FRANKY] Get out here and
fight me, Straw Hat!

237
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:07,067
Where are you?! Stop hiding!

238
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,103
I thought that little
turd had some backbone,

239
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,572
but I guess I was wrong.

240
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,474
Won't even show his face.

241
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,142
I know what you're saying, bro,

242
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,411
but to be fair, the whole
island is hunting him down

243
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,445
right now, you know?

244
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,281
Exactly! I bet he's hiding,

245
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:23,083
if he hasn't been
caught already.

246
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,752
By the way, what's
with this weird crab

247
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:25,753
walk thing all of a sudden.

248
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,688
If we face the front,
then the wind catches

249
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,792
our hair and we blow away!

250
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,761
Speaking of which, the
weather isn't the only thing

251
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:35,429
that's out of control today.

252
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,630
[MOZU]
Tell me about it.

253
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,233
It's like you've got a rampage
going on inside you, too.

254
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,270
Shut up. I'm just like
that this week, okay?

255
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,139
[ZAMBAI]
Hey bro!

256
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,041
[GROUP]
Hey, it's bro! Hey, bro!

257
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,643
[MOZU]
Well, if it isn't Zambai!

258
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,680
Tell me, tell me that you
beat up those stupid Straw Hats.

259
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,114
No, but I tried to.

260
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,282
Some angry mob showed up,

261
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,217
got in the way,
then Luffy took off.

262
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,619
[GROUP]
Huh?

263
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,588
Are those guys lucky or what?

264
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,557
When you're on a rampage,
nobody survives!

265
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,626
That's weird. I wondered
why that weak dude

266
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,095
with the long nose was
fixing the ship on his own.

267
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,097
I figured that you'd wrecked
up the rest of the crew

268
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,133
so bad that he was the only one
left who could do anything.

269
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,469
Wait. You found one of 'em?!

270
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,771
Yeah, on their ship.

271
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:22,276
[FRANKY chuckles]

272
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,446
Well, that's just fine,
'cause all we need is one.

273
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,647
In other words,

274
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,084
we'll use that loser as bait
to lure out the rest of 'em.

275
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:34,321
Whoa, Bro's got his
bad guy face on, guys.

276
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,056
All right, you
good-for-nothings,

277
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,291
I want you to march
through the town

278
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,426
and spread the word for me.

279
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,462
Say "we've got Long-Nose

280
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,397
and if you don't want him
swimming with the fishes,

281
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,200
then come to the
warehouse under the bridge."

282
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,569
Tell 'em Franky sent ya.

283
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,273
[chuckles]

284
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,541
In the meantime,
I'll go nab Long Nose

285
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,111
so we can make good
on our little threat.

286
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,580
You got it, Bro! I swear
we won't let you down!

287
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,103
Hey, you. Yeah,
you with the luggage.

288
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,338
What's all that stuff you got?

289
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,740
It's my special bed.

290
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,411
[CHILDREN]
Aqua Laguna! Agua Laguna!

291
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:34,448
Aqua Laguna is coming for you!

292
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,150
[CHILD A]
Here comes a big wave!

293
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,118
[laughter, play shrieks]

294
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,520
So do you know
what's going on

295
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,754
with those Straw Hats?

296
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,621
I'm not sure.

297
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,390
I don't think they've
caught them yet.

298
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,392
Tsk! Still on the loose!

299
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,094
Ah... That's no good!

300
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,730
And with everyone so
worked up about the storm,

301
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,699
they'll have the perfect
chance to attack again.

302
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,135
[CHILD B] Aaah!
Aqua Laguna's gonna get me!

303
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,437
And what I heard,
is that tonight,

304
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,505
all the craftsmen from
the Galley-La Company

305
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,108
will be guarding the main
office to protect the mayor.

306
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,778
Whoa, that's a really
big deal, isn't it?

307
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,348
[CITIZEN F] How many people
have the Straw Hats got, anyway?

308
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:10,784
[CITIZEN G] Some say 50.
Some say 100 or even more!

309
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,255
Remember, the captain's got a
100 million bounty on his head.

310
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:17,558
For all we know, he could be
sending an army of 3,000 men

311
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,627
to fight the
shipwrights as we speak!

312
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,462
Are you kidding?!
That sounds really bad!

313
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,336
[CRAFTSMAN M]
All right, men,

314
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,273
hold your formation
and don't give an inch!

315
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,741
[GROUP]
Yeah!

316
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,510
Don't even let a single
fly get through, got it?!

317
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:39,112
[GROUP]
Yeah!

318
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,731
Bring it on!! Wahahaha!!

319
00:19:57,764 --> 00:20:00,200
What's wrong with you?!

320
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,536
Would you please
be quiet, Tiletone?!

321
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,271
[LULU]
I heard the Straw Hats

322
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,574
weren't spotted on
the sea train.

323
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:10,344
That means they're still
here on the island somewhere.

324
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,413
Still. They'd be complete
idiots if they tried

325
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:14,582
to show up with all
of these guards around.

326
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,583
Yeah, you'd think,

327
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,817
but that didn't
stop the dumbass

328
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,688
that barged in
here earlier, did it?

329
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,524
We gotta be ready for anything.

330
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:28,095
[ICEBERG] Mwell, this is
reassuring, but it's a bit much.

331
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,764
They wanted to
do this for you.

332
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,433
I'm not royalty.

333
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,201
Pardon me sir,
but why on earth

334
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:38,172
did you put Nico Robin's
wanted poster up on your wall?

335
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,073
It bother you?

336
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,244
A bit.

337
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:45,111
Hmm...

338
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,382
It's better if you don't know.

339
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,288
That girl is a demon.

340
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,152
[CHOPPER] There sure are
a lot of people out there.

341
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:26,320
It's a little far, too.

342
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,689
It'll be fine if you rocket
through the window, right?

343
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,624
After Robin shows up, I mean.

344
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,660
That' right. If we
make a commotion first,

345
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,229
then they'll just sneak in while
we're dealing with the guards.

346
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:37,131
Let's be patient.

347
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,065
[CRAFTSMAN M]
Get ready!

348
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,068
Strike at anything
that moves, men! Got it?

349
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,770
[GROUP]
Yeah!

350
00:21:57,584 --> 00:22:02,589

351
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,462
[NAMI] What was
that explosion?!

352
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:16,630
[ZORO] Looks like
they're on the move.

353
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,166
[NAMI] Uh oh, who are those
weird people in the masks?

354
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,235
[LUFFY] All I know is
that Robin's in there, too.

355
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:22,503
[ZORO] Remember,
if we miss her here,

356
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,371
we may never see her again.

357
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,640
[LUFFY] I know.
We'll catch her for sure.

358
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,276
We're gonna settle
this tonight, Robin.

I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
