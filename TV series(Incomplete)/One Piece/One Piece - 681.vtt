[cackles]

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.088
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.992
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:42.505
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.649
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.555
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:45.798
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.514
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.857
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.333
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:04.869
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:16.225
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:18.263
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:20.467
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:23.339
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:26.112
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.518
After learning of the
Kingdom's dark history,

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:30.487
Usopp broke the curse
on its people,

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.324
revealing the truth to all.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:34.462
Doflamingo, left with
no other option,

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:37.736
confined the island in his
inescapable "Birdcage."

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.910
[DOFLAMINGO] Now, it's time
to watch the final act unfold.

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:44.917
The Birdcage...

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.653
...it's starting!

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:55.370
[LAW]
Doflamingo...

00:03:55.404 --> 00:03:58.877
...will kill every
person in Dressrosa.

Damn! It's just
dulling my blade!

00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:22.893
[PIRATE B]
Move! Lemme give it a try!

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.929
That do it?

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.502
[PIRATES gasp]

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:30.808

Daddy!

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.464
Everyone! Get out of here!
I'm not in control of what I do!

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:52.050
[laughs] No one's
coming to help you.

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:55.758
And not a single soul will be
able to leave the "Birdcage."

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.929
Hello? Hello?

00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:00.133
[DOFLAMINGO]
By the way, it's also useless

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.903
to call for outside help.

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:06.914
Not one solitary, pathetic
whimper can escape this place.

00:05:06.947 --> 00:05:08.517
Quite the predicament.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.355
You're going to be killed by
the people you trust the most.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.159
[TOWNSMAN I]
Please, help, somebody!

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:15.364
I don't wanna hurt my family!

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:17.902
Your neighbors, friends,
and loved ones

00:05:17.936 --> 00:05:19.572
will continue to rampage.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.578
Killing anyone in
their way. Even you.

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:24.348
[TOWNSMAN J]
P-Please don't do this!

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:28.657
I swear, I don't wanna
hurt you! I'm sorry!

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:34.702
Get back! I can't
fight it! Get away!

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.410

[MARINES groaning]

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.982
[DOFLAMINGO] It's pointless
to run and hide.

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:01.857
You'll find that there's no safe
place to be in the Birdcage.

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:05.698
You'll only be met with terror
that'll last for days on end.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:08.069
There's only two ways
this can stop.

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:12.745
Either you all die out,
or you meet my win conditions.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.952

Damn that Doflamingo!

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.763
You can never predict
his next move!

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:23.466
[TOY MAN B] I can't believe
the factory somehow

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.771
up and disappeared like that!
How is that possible?

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:28.644
[TOY MAN A] Who cares!
This is our chance to scram!

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:30.581
[TOY MAN C] We can finally
escape this hellhole!

00:06:30.614 --> 00:06:33.386
At long last, I never thought
I'd live to see the day!

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.225
Praise be to the
all mighty god Usopp!

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:38.462

Kin'emon! There you are.
I'm glad you're all right!

[KIN'EMON]
Metal breast-bands?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.053
Indeed, this is quite
the foreign culture.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:52.993
[KIN'EMON]
How splendid!

00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.849
Miss Robin, can I be your slave?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:07.321
No, I mean... Can I
ask you somethin'?

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:08.624
[ROBIN]
Hm?

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.061
Uh, so like, that guy's nose--

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:13.199
To me, it has more than
a passing resemblance

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:16.038
to Sniper King's. The guy
who shot down the flag

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:17.341
at the Tower of Law.

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:20.881
[ROBIN] Yes, that's him.
His name is Usopp.

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:30.902
Ohhh! And to think he's
here with Miss Robin,

00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:33.406
who was moved by the
actions of her crew.

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.909
Who turned against
the whole world

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:37.247
in order to save one
of their mates!

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.487
I'm blessed by the
"Enies Lobby Duo"!

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:44.261
Yes! Oh, yes! Yeah!

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:48.035
Can you stop geeking out
for a second? Just shut up!

Hmm...

00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:56.118
This is the same kid
who broke my wrist?

00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:58.122
[KIN'EMON] I leave these
lilliputian warriors

00:07:58.155 --> 00:07:59.391
in your care.

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:02.197
Though tiny in stature,
they're rich in courage.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.468
Topknot-land! How kind of you!

00:08:04.502 --> 00:08:06.707
We found them like this
in the palace.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.713
They're in pretty rough shape,
but they fought hard.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:12.818
We're so proud of you!
Great job, guys!

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:23.975
Stop me! Somebody!
My body is out of control!

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:26.847
Help me!

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:34.027
[sobs] This is exactly like
the tragedy from a decade ago!

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.602
[TOWNSMAN R]
I now know the truth.

00:08:37.636 --> 00:08:41.342
That night that King
Riku attacked us,

00:08:41.376 --> 00:08:43.613
it wasn't his fault!

00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.692
He was manipulated!

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:56.172

Manipulated by Doflamingo!

[DOFLAMINGO] You're angry?
Then scream! Suffer!

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:06.960
You'll all eventually become
casualties of this wicked game!

Doflamingo! Stop
this lunacy. Ah...

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:36.152
[DOFLAMINGO] Think it over.
Will you attempt to kill me?

00:09:36.185 --> 00:09:39.491
Or will spare yourselves
and join my Family?

00:09:39.526 --> 00:09:41.730
All that I'm asking you
to do is to hold just

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.936
12 fools accountable
for rebelling against me.

00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:46.305
If you make the wrong choice,

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:49.913
you'll never get to see
the end result of this game.

00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:53.252
The stars will be worth
100 million berries each.

...100 million berries?!

00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:56.660

onto the Two-stars.

[TOY MAN G]
A-Army Commander Kyros!

00:11:05.597 --> 00:11:08.770
Wasn't he the...
invincible gladiator?

00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:11.810
He listed pirates, too!
I saw the Straw Hat Crew!

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:16.051
Violet was Princess Viola?
But she's with the Family!

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:21.996
[laughs] And now, let's move
onto the head honchos.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.334
I present to you
the Three-stars!

Law and Straw Hat?
Who'd have thought we'd be

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.582
hunting the alliance that
shocked the world!

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:05.917
The king?

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:09.224
He was still alive!
Poor King Riku!

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:11.697
He's from the
Revolutionary Army!

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.099
That's their Chief of Staff!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.802
Looks like you've got fans.

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.238

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:24.421
[USOPP] Well, that's a relief.
Glad I didn't make the list.

00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:27.494
[DOFLAMINGO] And finally,
there's one man in particular

00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:31.301
who aroused my indignation and
resentment more than the others.

00:12:31.335 --> 00:12:34.743
You can direct all complaints
to this guy as he's the reason

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.581
you're all forced to play
this ruthless game.

00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:42.023
And the person who kills him
will get a hearty reward.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:51.542
[DOFLAMINGO]
Five hundred million berries!

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:33.192
Five-stars, huh?

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:36.533
I spot a pair of One-stars
and a Three-star, too!

00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.270
What do you want us to do, Sabo?

00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:42.477
We should make our escape.
Get to the surface! Let's hurry!

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:46.686
You gotta die! Please
forgive us, God Usopp!

Huh? These traitors
were all worshiping me

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:57.373

00:14:00.447 --> 00:14:03.620
I will be staying behind

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:04.856
Please excuse me.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.993
Be careful!

[TOY MAN S] That's one

00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:16.112
He's worth 100 million!
That's the samurai!

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:18.617
This is quite vexing!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:24.328
[KIN'EMON] Uh! Huh? If I recall,
this is the scrap heap!

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.133
Kanjuro are you there?
Please respond!

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:28.971
[TOY MAN U] The 100 million
berries are as good as mine!

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:30.674
[KIN'EMON]
I've no choice!

00:14:30.707 --> 00:14:33.814
[TOY MAN V] He's gone! Our
paycheck fell down the hole!

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:36.251
[KIN'EMON yelling]

00:14:36.284 --> 00:14:39.258
[TOWNSMAN Y]
Get outta here!

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:42.130
You have little time
for indecisiveness.

00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:44.636
The longer this takes,
the more people fall,

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:46.940
the more buildings burn.

00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:49.011
Either you kill me,

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:53.118
or you take out the
12 targeted criminals.

00:14:56.793 --> 00:15:00.734
[DOFLAMINGO]
Now, let the games begin!

00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:06.979
[laughing]

00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:29.792
I dunno. This feels wrong,

00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:33.499
now that we know King Riku
was innocent all this time.

00:15:35.937 --> 00:15:38.009
What if everyone
in town teams up?

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:41.115
Then we might have a shot
at taking Doflamingo out!

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:42.150
[TOWNSMAN AD]
Hmm...

00:15:42.184 --> 00:15:44.588
It's not just him, though.

00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:47.494
He's got at least 2,000
people in his Family.

00:15:47.528 --> 00:15:48.931
And I bet they're
more than willing

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.268
to throw their lives
on the line for him.

00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:53.239
What are we supposed to do?

00:15:53.272 --> 00:15:56.780
King Riku is near the top
of the most wanted list.

00:15:56.813 --> 00:16:02.323
Should we have his back?
He's innocent.

00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:05.496
Maybe it's okay if we
take them in alive?

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.870
Like, if we apprehend them,
that might be good enough.

00:16:08.903 --> 00:16:12.511
What else can we do?
We're out of options!

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:13.514
--Agreed!
--Yeah.

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.349
Fine! Okay!

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:18.857
Oops, looks like we
broke the robot.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.363
Guess that's one down
and 11 to go. Huh?

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:26.105
[SEÑOR] Uh? Coulda sworn that
cyborg was down for the count.

00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:28.543
Where did he run off to?

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:34.220
[FRANKY panting]

00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:38.229
I got a case of cola with your
name on it, SMILE factory!

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:40.099
Huh? Look, over there!

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.435
It's one of the Straw Hats!

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.270
[FRANKY panting]

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:43.405
[PIRATE D]
Get back here!

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:45.510
Wait a sec! Aren't
you guys the ex-toys

00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:47.581
who were saved by Usopp?
What gives?

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:51.254
[PIRATE D laughing]
I promise it's nothing personal!

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:54.127
You're worth 100 million berries
though and a man's gotta eat!

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.668
[PIRATE E]
I'm collecting the bounty!

00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:00.239
Let's go! You suckers!

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:02.945
All of you are being
blinded by money!

00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:04.414
Go ahead and try!

00:17:04.448 --> 00:17:07.855
I'm gonna stomp you
for being greedy!

00:17:07.888 --> 00:17:09.626
[PIRATES scream]

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:12.598
Heh. Talk loud, get plowed.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.769
[gasps] Get that guy!

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:15.871
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.608
He's one of the
criminals on the list!

00:17:17.642 --> 00:17:18.475
[TOWNSMEN grunting]

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.410
Let's go!

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:20.814
[TOWNSMAN AH]
Let's take him down!

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:24.020
[TOWNSMEN grunting]

00:17:24.053 --> 00:17:26.693
[TOWNSMAN AB]
Don't worry about us! Shoot!

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:28.028
[FRANKY]
Cut it out already!

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:30.333
I don't have time to
dance with you punks!

00:17:30.366 --> 00:17:33.272
[TOWNSMAN AC]
Hurry! Shoot him!

00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:34.876
[TOWNSMEN grunting]

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:36.946
Do it!

00:17:36.979 --> 00:17:38.550
Go ahead, pal.

00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:41.321

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.572

What else have ya got?

[TOWNSMAN Z gasping]

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.318
We don't have a choice.
There's no other way out.

00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:03.065
If I fight you losers one
on one, this'll never end.

[TOWNSMAN AC whimpers]

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.578
[FRANKY chuckles]
This should do it.

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:12.317
Usopp did his part,
now it's my turn!

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.124
I'm gonna bash that
factory into pieces!

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.168
[TREBOL]
Hey, hey!

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:23.640
How did the factory
move on its own, huh?

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:25.911
It was Pica.

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:28.916

[DOFLAMINGO]
Diamante! Good.

00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:37.668
I didn't realize you
were there, too.

00:18:37.702 --> 00:18:39.171
Uh, yeah.

00:18:39.204 --> 00:18:41.474
Doffy. I got some bad news.

to the palace at once.

[ROBIN]
Where are you?

00:19:17.714 --> 00:19:21.187
Well, uh... I think it's called
"The King's Plateau."

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:23.660
Anyway, I'm here
with Luffy's group.

00:19:23.694 --> 00:19:26.164
Things are gettin'
messy, aren't they?

00:19:26.197 --> 00:19:29.071
Oh, Robin, hey!
Did you see Mingo?

00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:31.241
Man, he makes me so mad!

00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:34.214

pretty hilarious though!

Shut up, Luffy!

I saw Rebecca was on
that dumb list, too.

I hope she's doing okay.

Is that you Lucy?

Oh! Great timing then! Guess
what! The soldier's with me!

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:55.924

Let's get 'em!

Soldier's there? He turned back
into a human, didn't he?

00:20:07.213 --> 00:20:10.152
Tell me, Lucy! What is he like?

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:15.162
That's a funny question!
You mean you don't know?

00:20:15.195 --> 00:20:16.866

to protect yours,

whatever the cost!

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:55.376
Some day... happiness
will return to you.

Until then, I will
stay by your side!
