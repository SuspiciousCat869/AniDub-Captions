00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,052
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,221
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,835
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,446
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,159
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,954
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,248
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:26,011
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

30
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:29,097
...Fireworks!

31
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,641
[WHITE BERETS yell]

32
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,237
They defeated the White Berets!

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,322
Unbelievable!

34
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,409
[laughs]

35
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,370
[MCKINLEY] Sorry, criminals!
You have no chance of escape.

36
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:56,374
You should've behaved and
done what I told you to do.

37
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,711
Of all the upholders of
law here in Skypiea,

38
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:02,255
we White Berets are
the most lenient.

39
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:06,634
However, they are not
nearly as forgiving!

40
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,636
[MCKINLEY laughs]

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,221
[MCKINLEY]
Congratulations.

42
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:13,475
You are now considered
second degree criminals.

43
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,935
You can try to cry for mercy...

44
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,937
[MCKINLEY laughs]

45
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,899
[MCKINLEY]
...but you all will be judged...

46
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:23,443
...by the Priests of Upper Yard!

47
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:24,861
Heso!

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,448
[LUFFY]
"Is Escape Possible?

49
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:31,159
God's Challenge
is Set in Motion."

50
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:38,917
What's wrong with those guys?

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,293
Forget them.

52
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:43,546
That old lady ratted us out.

53
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,798
She lied to us.

54
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,842
She said it was okay
for us to pass through.

55
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:51,429
But when we did, they
accused us of illegal entry?

56
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:54,015
That's flat out fraud!

57
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:55,600
Exactly.

58
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:57,811
But then, even if we were
told we couldn't pass,

59
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,604
we would've just forced
our way through.

60
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:02,065
I mean, how was that little
old lady gonna stop us?

61
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:03,316
Shut up!

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,068
In any case, you're in
a great deal of trouble.

63
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,237
You're now second-degree
criminals, and as such,

64
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,949
I'm afraid Conis and I are
unable to assist you any longer.

65
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:14,119
Why are you talking to us
from way over there?

66
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,663
I don't really see
what the big deal is.

67
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:19,124
I'm surprised you're not
used to this by now.

68
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,750
[chuckles]

69
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,752
[LUFFY]
I've been meaning to ask.

70
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,713
Why'd you come back, Nami?

71
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:25,797
What?

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,298
We were finally gonna
get to set sail

73
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,718
and head out on an amazing
adventure until you--

74
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,928
I mean, we were about
to come looking for you.

75
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,096
We were getting worried.

76
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,347
[LUFFY chuckles]

77
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,517
I think you and I need
to have a little talk.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,601
[yelps]

79
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,312
[NAMI]
Forget about your big adventure.

80
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:44,232
It's never gonna happen.

81
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,817
You haven't seen what I've seen.

82
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,527
That island is full
of the type of people

83
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,611
you don't wanna mess with.

84
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,447
I don't care who
you think you are.

85
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,115
Granted, we don't know
what this guy is,

86
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:53,533
but his powers are real.

87
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,910
And there's no way I'm ever
goin' back there again.

88
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:58,246
So forget it. Got me?

89
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,669
How 'bout you just relax
here while the rest of us go?

90
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:05,920
We're wanted criminals!

91
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,089
I'm not staying here a
minute longer, either.

92
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,300
Are you nuts? Get your
priorities straight.

93
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:13,011
The adventure is always
the most important part!

94
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:16,222
My priorities are life
first, then money.

95
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:18,224
Please tell me I'm
third on that list.

96
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,559
Don't push me.

97
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:21,394
[USOPP]
You raise a good point.

98
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,773
We put all of our energy into
just trying to get up here.

99
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:25,982
But we never really
thought about

100
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,650
how we were gonna get back.

101
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,319
[SUU]
Suu.

102
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:32,405
Is there a safe way back
to the Blue Sea World?

103
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:35,742
Can we ever even go home again?

104
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,243
There is a way,
but at this juncture,

105
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,162
I'm afraid it's no longer safe.

106
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:40,622
Your only hope for escape

107
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,082
is to make your
way to Cloud End.

108
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,751
From there you can travel home.

109
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:48,296
What's Cloud End? And how are
we supposed to get there?

110
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,548
[CONIS] It's a region
that lies far to the east.

111
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:51,925
The only way for
you to get there

112
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:55,428
is to travel across
the White White Sea.

113
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:56,638
Okay!

114
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,765
So we sail east, and we
eventually get home!

115
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:01,685
But I don't wanna go home.

116
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,688
Your other option is stay
and get sentenced to death.

117
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:05,772
Listen to me.

118
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,399
I don't want you causing
any more trouble

119
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:09,317
for Conis and her dad.

120
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,569
No. Don't worry about us.

121
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:12,946
Even if we leave right now,

122
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,615
there's no guarantee we'll
make a clean escape.

123
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,660
We don't have any time to
lose, so just get on the ship.

124
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,328
You'll have your
adventure, I promise,

125
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,038
but right now, we
need to get going.

126
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:24,332
So come on everybody.
Let's set sail.

127
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,126
[OTHERS grumbling]

128
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,546
Thanks for all your help!
We really appreciate it!

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,798
Ooh! Hold on.

130
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,008
Come on! Now what?

131
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:34,801
Hey, old man!

132
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,511
Huh? What is it, Luffy?

133
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:38,263
[LUFFY]
Can I ask I favor?

134
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,432
Ya mind if we take the
leftovers from earlier?

135
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:42,183
Of course not.
They're all yours.

136
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:45,186
Woohoo! Come on, Sanji!
Make us lunch!

137
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,730
Glad you got priorities.

138
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:50,900
In that case, could I ask for
a teensy little favor, too?

139
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:52,527
You're an engineer, right?

140
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,988
I don't suppose you could
spare any parts or tools

141
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,656
to fix our ship?

142
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,366
What's mine is yours, Usopp.

143
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,493
Feel free to take
anything you need.

144
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:03,413
Uh, guys. Where are you going?

145
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,623
[LUFFY]
Hello! They got food!

146
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,752
Tell ya what, you go ahead
and ready the ship for departure

147
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:12,297
and we'll be back
before you know it.

148
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,592
He's dead-set on goin'
to that island.

149
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,968
Doesn't he get it?

150
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:19,846
Don't take it out on us.
You know how he is.

151
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,724
Seriously, try to relax.

152
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,435
Chopper. You're still on
my side, aren't you?

153
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:26,603
Aren't you?

154
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,396
Don't answer that.

155
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:31,941
[CHOPPER]
Heavy point!

156
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:40,367
I was about to drop the
ladder for you, you know?

157
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:44,913
[ZORO] You know there's no
persuading Luffy of anything.

158
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:47,832
He won't listen even if
we all gang up on him.

159
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,627
Fine, then I guess
I'll just stay put.

160
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,463
Well, you're free to do
whatever you want.

161
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:55,465
I know that.

162
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:58,760
But if I stay here,
I'll be killed!

163
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:02,305
Yep. Quite a predicament.

164
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:06,976
Jerk.

165
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,269
Robin.

166
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,313
Let's go beat some
sense into Luffy.

167
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:11,856
Won't work.

168
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,149
[sighs]

169
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,442
I guess we'd have
a better chance

170
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,361
against the White Berets.

171
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:18,363
And you know they've
already gotta be gathering

172
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,740
reinforcements to follow us.

173
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,744
[MCKINLEY chuckles]

174
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,746
[MCKINLEY]
Follow you? Idiots.

175
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,791
Eneru and his Priests
aren't going anywhere.

176
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:33,753
Why should I bother when
your true judgment awaits?

177
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:36,798
Once you weigh anchor,
your challenge will begin.

178
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,259
Your ship will set
its own course

179
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:42,512
to the forbidden
Sacred Grounds.

180
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,558
[MCKINLEY]
The Upper Yard!

181
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:56,443
I-I feel I need to
tell you something.

182
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,202
[NAMI] There's a cloud
current that'll take us

183
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,204
down to the White Sea?

184
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:08,955
Yes.

185
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,373
By entering the current,

186
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:12,709
you can cross the vast expanse
of the White White Sea.

187
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,711
Then it will take you all
the way to Cloud End

188
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,671
and you won't have to
worry about getting lost.

189
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,048
Really?

190
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:19,632
[CONIS]
As long as you ride the current,

191
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,801
nobody will be
able to catch you.

192
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:23,386
[NAMI]
Hm.

193
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,347
I've got it:
We won't tell Luffy,

194
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,932
we'll just sail the Going
Merry into the current.

195
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:29,726
And what? We just
hope he doesn't notice

196
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,144
until it's too late?

197
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,730
Even so, I seriously doubt
he'll give up his quest.

198
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,273
[NAMI growls]

199
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,067
If you like, I'd be
happy to guide you

200
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,234
to the entrance of the current

201
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,403
to make sure you set
off for home safely.

202
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:41,654
Great.

203
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,198
Now we have to make sure
Luffy doesn't catch wind

204
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,324
of what's going on.

205
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,326
But don't worry.
We'll take care of that.

206
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,702
Then ready your ship

207
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,746
and I'll be back with the
others as soon as I can.

208
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,791
You got it. We really
appreciate it, Conis.

209
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:54,876
[giggles] You're welcome.

210
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,716
[LUFFY]
This is really good.

211
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,720
[SANJI] Save some for the trip.
And for the rest of us.

212
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:09,391
[LUFFY] There's plenty here.
Why hold back?

213
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:11,184
This does have
to feed all of us.

214
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,852
Conis! Refill!

215
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,854
Why don't you get it yourself?

216
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,773
Speaking of, where is Conis?

217
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:19,859
[PAGAYA] I think she went to
bid farewell to the others.

218
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:22,362
Oh, I brought you some more tea.

219
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,368
[PAGAYA] So you're the
shipwright for your vessel,

220
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,536
aren't you?

221
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:32,414
Well, not really.
Actually, I'm a sniper.

222
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,082
[PAGAYA]
Wow. That sounds exciting.

223
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:35,625
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:39,045
But it means we don't have a
regular shipwright in our crew.

225
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,464
Let's see, how can I
put this delicately?

226
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,842
I am cursed with supreme
skill on every subject

227
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:45,885
and the whole crew relies on me!

228
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,804
[laughing]

229
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,305
[USOPP]
Yeah, it's a lotta work,

230
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:53,101
but without me the ship
just wouldn't function.

231
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,061
My official title
is Sharpshooter,

232
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:58,356
but I'm also the co-captain.

233
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,028
And that's why everyone
calls me Captain... Usopp

234
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,446
[PAGAYA]
Ooh, your color arrangement

235
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,740
clearly denotes the work
of a professional.

236
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:07,949
Of course.

237
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,869
I consider the plating
of food an art form.

238
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,372
[NAMI]
Bye, Conis! See ya in a bit!

239
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:15,957
[CONIS]
Be right back.

240
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,253
Ha! Finally, a light at
the end of the tunnel.

241
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:22,339
For a while there I was
really getting worried.

242
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,090
I'm still a bit skeptical
that the current

243
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,508
will actually take us home.

244
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:27,010
Why's that?

245
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:29,929
If what she says is true,
and this current really exists,

246
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:31,097
wouldn't it stand to reason

247
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,682
that we would hear
more stories of people

248
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:35,268
returning safely
from sky island?

249
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,395
But you have to remember
that very few people

250
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,190
ever manage to find their way
up here in the first place.

251
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,067
So, of course, you're not
gonna hear many stories

252
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,610
about people coming back.

253
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,028
And even if they did
find the current,

254
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:46,821
there's no guarantee their
ship could withstand

255
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:48,948
the high speeds it requires.

256
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:50,325
Good point.

257
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,702
A lot of captains don't know
when to call it quits.

258
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:54,412
Let's hurry and weigh anchor.

259
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,789
Get ready to set sail.

260
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,499
Chopper, use your Weight Bonus

261
00:11:57,582 --> 00:11:59,417
and help us out with
the heavy lifting.

262
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,003
[CHOPPER] I keep telling you,
it's called Heavy Point.

263
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:02,962
[NAMI]
What?

264
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,297
[CHOPPER]
Nothing. Never mind.

265
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:05,799
[NAMI]
Now wake Zoro up.

266
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,050
[ROBIN]
But how?

267
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:08,510
[CHOPPER] Don't worry.
I don't need his help.

268
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:09,844
[NAMI]
We better hurry.

269
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,888
Conis gave us this chance,
and we can't waste it!

270
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,473
[CHOPPER]
Heavy Point!

271
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,699
[SANJI]
Maybe I'll put this here.

272
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,158
Naw, that doesn't work.

273
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:33,702
Throws off the
whole arrangement.

274
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,203
If I put the red one here

275
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:38,081
and then the emerald green
broad beans across the back...

276
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,543
Yeah. Ah, now this
looks delicious.

277
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,295
I sure hope Nami and Robin
appreciate the hard work.

278
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,548
Wow! It doesn't even
look like food.

279
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:47,632
I've never seen such

280
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,634
a beautifully prepared
lunch before.

281
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:50,969
Here.

282
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:52,846
I made one for you as well.

283
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,557
Really? Custom made just for me?

284
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,975
I've prepared all the food today

285
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,852
according to a
theme I've chosen.

286
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,146
I call it: "Love is a
Cruel Mistress Feast

287
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,439
for a Fallen Angel."

288
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,356
I see.

289
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,525
I don't get what
all the fuss is.

290
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,569
It's just a box lunch.

291
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:11,740
How dare you trash my work!
You better watch your mouth!

292
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,950
A great meal starts with
great presentation!

293
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,453
[LUFFY] Why bother?
It all comes out the same.

294
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:18,329
[SANJI] You're stuffing your
face without even looking!

295
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:21,041
[LUFFY]
Yeah, and...?

296
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:23,209
Why're you so mad?
It still tastes good.

297
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:26,046
'Cause food should please your
eyes as well as your palate!

298
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,172
[LUFFY]
Well, that's just stupid.

299
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,965
Not even I can eat with my eyes.

300
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,717
[SANJI] That's not what
I meant, you infant!

301
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,719
[LUFFY] 'Course I did kinda eat
with my nose once. But...

302
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,512
[SANJI]
Oh, just stop talking!

303
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,185
Now we just wait till Luffy
and the others get back.

304
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,151
All set?

305
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:49,444
All set.

306
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,074
[yelping]

307
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,579
Chopper! What's going on?

308
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,541
[chuckles]

309
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,975
What's goin' on?

310
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:23,269
I think we might already
be caught in the current.

311
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:25,855
[gasps] Hey!

312
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,232
Something's wrong with the ship.

313
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:28,358
[SANJI]
Huh?

314
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,777
What is it?

315
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,904
Take a look! She just started
rockin' all of a sudden!

316
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,114
Really?

317
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:36,658
Hope they're not havin'
a party without us.

318
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:39,119
Hey, look. It's Nami.

319
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:45,041
Wait. Why in the world
is she wearing a t-shirt?

320
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,628
I'm pretty sure we have more
pressing concerns right now!

321
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:51,381
Guys, look! The ship
started moving.

322
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:53,633
But why?

323
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,803
They wouldn't just leave
us here, would they?

324
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,388
Whoa!

325
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:01,433
I don't think I've ever seen a
ship sailing backwards before.

326
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:04,144
But they haven't even
set the sails yet.

327
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:05,437
Huh?

328
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,690
There's something underneath!

329
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,195
I think we're being
dragged away.

330
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,072
But by what?

331
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:19,284
[screaming]

332
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:22,704
You sure we're not stuck in that
current Conis told us about?

333
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:25,874
[ROBIN] No. I think we
have a bigger issue here.

334
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,587
[LUFFY, SANJI, USOPP]
'Kay, what is that?

335
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,381
It must be--

336
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,719
[PAGAYA] It's the legendary
White White Sea

337
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,930
Super-Express Lobster!

338
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,182
[LUFFY, SANJI, USOPP]
What?

339
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:48,563
Guys, we're being hijacked!
We'll have to abandon ship!

340
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:51,858
C'mon, we've gotta move right
now! While we still have time!

341
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:53,276
We can't leave the ship.

342
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,487
Without it we won't be
able to get back home.

343
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,406
Then I'll stay behind!
Just go now!

344
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,202
Forget it! You can't defend
the whole ship by yourself!

345
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,828
[ZORO]
I'll manage.

346
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:21,930
Oh, come on.

347
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,973
[cracking]

348
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,600
That's more like it.

349
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,768
[gasps]

350
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,482
All right. Makin' progress.

351
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:34,901
[ROBIN] I don't think
that'll get you anywhere.

352
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,030
[ROBIN]
Come back on board.

353
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:40,407
Why should I?

354
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,866
[ROBIN] You'll never be able
to significantly damage

355
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,577
that creature, and we've got
bigger problems now. Look.

356
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,954
What?

357
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,961
[ROBIN]
A school of vicious sky fish

358
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:55,380
are following us
ready to attack.

359
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:58,466
We can't jump ship
and escape now.

360
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,593
Even if we manage to
defeat the sky fish,

361
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:03,596
I'm sure that more will
arrive to take their place.

362
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,974
Our punishment has
already begun.

363
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:07,726
And there's no way to stop it.

364
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,602
Heaven's Judgment.

365
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:12,355
They must be taking us
to the forbidden island.

366
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,274
Guess they got tired of waiting.

367
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,985
Eneru's really got it in for us.

368
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:21,448
Oh, no. Please.
I can't go back there.

369
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,453
Luffy. Help us!

370
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:29,706
Sanji, Usopp!

371
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,504
[SKY FISH roaring]

372
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:43,887
[laughs]

373
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,905
Why, Nami? Why a t-shirt?

374
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,782
You're still thinking of that?

375
00:18:03,865 --> 00:18:05,408
This is awful, Luffy!
What are we gonna do?

376
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:08,036
We have to rescue
Nami and the others!

377
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,162
[LUFFY]
Hmm.

378
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,748
I wonder...
Where're they're going?

379
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:14,834
Where're they're
going? Yes, right!

380
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,544
[LUFFY]
I got nothin'.

381
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,088
[PAGAYA]
Um, well.

382
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,714
[LUFFY, USOPP, SANJI]
Huh?

383
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,258
[PAGAYA]
Oh. Uh...

384
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,053
The Super-Express Lobster
is a messenger of Eneru.

385
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:29,099
He must be taking your friends
as a sacrificial offering.

386
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,809
If that's the case,

387
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,936
they are being taken to
the northeast Upper Yard.

388
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,979
To the sacrificial altar.

389
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,273
Say what?

390
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,442
You don't mean that Nami
and Robin and the rest...

391
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:40,276
The rest?

392
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,404
...are gonna be sacrificed?

393
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,322
To that wannabe God?

394
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,824
That bastard!

395
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:50,161
He better not harm a single hair
on my Nami's pretty head!

396
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,621
[PAGAYA]
But listen carefully,

397
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:54,708
because I have not yet told
you what else will happen.

398
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,834
What? There's more?

399
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,961
[PAGAYA]
You see, in Heaven's Judgment

400
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,880
there are actually two different
types of criminal punishment

401
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:03,883
and I've only told
you about the first.

402
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,052
The second punishment
is a challenge.

403
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:09,264
Your friends are currently
hostages in Eneru's hands.

404
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,642
And they are being taken
to him even as we speak.

405
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:14,853
Hostages?

406
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:16,271
I'm afraid I must tell you,

407
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,107
the criminals who are
to receive the judgement

408
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,527
are the three of you
standing before me.

409
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,988
Wait. What are you
trying to say?

410
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,573
If we only had a map.

411
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:30,994
[USOPP] Uh. I know I've got one
of Skypiea with me somewhere.

412
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,954
[PAGAYA]
Well, this one is very old,

413
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,873
but it looks like the general
shape of the island

414
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:36,791
is correctly rendered.

415
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,464
Conis, is everything all right?

416
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,715
I'm fine.

417
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:44,424
It's just--

418
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,176
[LUFFY]
Don't worry.

419
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,262
We'll figure something
out. We always do.

420
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:50,722
[chuckles]

421
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:52,766
How can you be sure?

422
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,642
[PAGAYA]
This is where we are now.

423
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,062
The sacrificial altar where
your friends are headed

424
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,606
is located a good distance
to the northeast,

425
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,358
here in the Upper Yard.

426
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:04,444
And I'm afraid there's only
one way to get there.

427
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:08,490
[PAGAYA]
You have to take the Milky Road

428
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,617
that leaves this island.

429
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,494
And your only means
of transportation

430
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:14,287
will be the waver.

431
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,915
The road will take you
to a great forest

432
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:19,751
where the Priests are
awaiting your arrival.

433
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:25,840
Well, let's see.

434
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,259
There's gotta be a better way
for us to get there unnoticed.

435
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:29,803
If we just ride up
to the front gate,

436
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,221
we won't stand a chance.

437
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,348
Couldn't we sneak
around the side?

438
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,141
Usopp's right.

439
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:36,267
If we take the main road,

440
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,770
they'll see us coming
and set a trap.

441
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:39,938
That may be

442
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,065
but even if you do
find your way ashore,

443
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,694
there's no way that you'll ever
make it to the altar on foot.

444
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,822
You see, your old map differs
from the current configuration

445
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:53,702
in that now the Milky Roads
criss-cross the entire island.

446
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,412
The cloud canals you mentioned.

447
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:56,579
Correct.

448
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:57,914
There are hundreds
of them, of all sizes,

449
00:20:57,997 --> 00:20:59,374
running every which way.

450
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,876
I don't think anyone really
knows where they all lead.

451
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,461
[LUFFY]
Hmm. I see.

452
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,214
That's why your only course
of action is as I've said.

453
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:08,758
You must follow the main
Milky Road to the island,

454
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,594
and from there continue
until you reach the altar.

455
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:13,596
Is that so?

456
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,598
And even if we do find
another way ashore,

457
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,934
the canals will block us
from continuing inland.

458
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,477
[PAGAYA]
That's right.

459
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,522
Did I mention the man-eating
fish that prowl the canal?

460
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,607
Geh. Man-eating fish?

461
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:27,318
Sounds like they've
covered all their bases.

462
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:32,157
So you're saying, if we want
our friends and ship back,

463
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,200
we have to walk right up
to their front door

464
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:35,827
and march on it.

465
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,497
This is part of the
challenge you mentioned?

466
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,332
Part of Heaven's Judgment?

467
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,584
Yes.

468
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,502
In Upper Yard, there are
four powerful Priests

469
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:46,921
of unimaginable strength
who await you.

470
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,090
[ringing]

471
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:53,011
[LUFFY] Hmm. Sounds like
a piece of cake.

472
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,764
I mean, all we have to do
to get our friends back

473
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,932
is beat up these Priests, right?

474
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,768
You make it sound easy.

475
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,480
[laughing]

476
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,940
Finally, a little action!

477
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:38,723
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

478
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:45,188
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

479
00:22:45,271 --> 00:22:48,108
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

480
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:50,860
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

481
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:54,739
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

482
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:59,786
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

483
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:03,707
<i>We will never yield</i>

484
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,583
<i>We won't back down</i>

485
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,878
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

486
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:15,385
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

487
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:18,847
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

488
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,267
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

489
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:30,150
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

490
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,706
[LUFFY] Conis, why are you
shaking like that?

491
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,332
[CONIS]
I guess I didn't notice.

492
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,084
[LUFFY]
And you seem kinda pale, too.

493
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:49,336
[CONIS]
I...

494
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:50,462
[LUFFY] You shoulda just
told us you were scared.

495
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,796
[CONIS]
You shouldn't talk to me.

496
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,298
[LUFFY]
What?

497
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,632
[CONIS] According to our laws,
if I see a known criminal,

498
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,676
I must take them to
the authorities,

499
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,511
or I'll be sentenced to death.

500
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,055
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

501
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,558
"A Trap on Lovely Street!
The Almighty Eneru."

502
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:06,061
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
