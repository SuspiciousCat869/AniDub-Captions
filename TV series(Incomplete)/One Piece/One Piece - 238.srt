1
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,817
He was shot two
times in the front

2
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,520
and another three from behind.

3
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,656
I have no idea what happened
in that room last night.

4
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,559
But whatever it was,
it was brutal.

5
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,162
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

6
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,832
Who in the hell did this?

7
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,501
They're not gonna
get away with it!

8
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,570
[FRANKY]
Damn you, Straw Hat Luffy!

9
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,738
So this is your payback

10
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,141
for us stealing your
200 million berries?

11
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,611
Unforgivable!

12
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,482
Come on, everybody,
no need-to-be-shy!

13
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,217
Say my name!

14
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,722
Come out and show
yourself, Straw Hat!

15
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,528
[LUFFY]

16
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:58,679
Come on, Straw Hat,
you can't hide from me!

17
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,581
Stop being such a pansy!

18
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,250
Get out here and
fight me already!

19
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,586
I dunno how that weirdo
figured out my name--

20
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,488
I've never seen him
before in my life!

21
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,290
Didn't you hear what
those people said?

22
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,725
I think that guy
might be Franky!

23
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,526
Then we've found him.

24
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,365
[thinking] He's the one
who beat up Usopp!

25
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,235
[FRANKY] This money belongs
to us now. Understand?

26
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,583
No! Give it back!

27
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,485
Give it back!

28
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,488
[LUFFY]
If it wasn't for him...

29
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,756
Luffy.

30
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,529
[LUFFY]
Hey! Bikini Guy!

31
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,297
[NAMI]
Hold on a sec!

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,134
Huh?

33
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,006
That's me. I'm Straw Hat.

34
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,376
[CITIZEN A] There's
still no information?

35
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,745
[CITIZEN B]
What's going on?!

36
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,779
[KALIFA]
Everyone.

37
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,584
So, what's the word?

38
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,257
[KALIFA]
You may enter,

39
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,392
but try to keep your
voices down, please.

40
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,694
Then he... He's okay?

41
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,398
His injuries are still
serious but Mr. Iceberg

42
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,200
has finally
regained consciousness.

43
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,204
That's great news!

44
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,272
C'mon, let's see
how he's doing!

45
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,510
[PAULIE]
You're okay!

46
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,179
Mmwell, I've been
better, I suppose.

47
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,382
All things considered,
you're pretty lucky!

48
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,717
Anyway, you just
focus on getting better.

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,419
In the meantime,
you can count on us

50
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,688
to take care of
the shipyard, okay?

51
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,523
Yes, of course.

52
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,258
Now, I need to talk
to you about the people

53
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,260
who broke into my
room last night.

54
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,327
Uh, yeah.

55
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,664
Well, that's still under
investigation, I'm afraid.

56
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,532
[ICEBERG]
No. I remember them.

57
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,199
Huh?

58
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,567
[gasps]

59
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,838
There were two.

60
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,575
One of them was a large man
who was wearing a mask.

61
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,377
And the other was a woman.

62
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,216
Tall, with long black hair.

63
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,353
[ICEBERG]
I could never forget those eyes.

64
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,488
It has to be her.

65
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,433
I can't believe
what I just heard.

66
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,368
Mr. Iceberg's awake, everyone.

67
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,304
It looks like our
mayor's gonna be okay!

68
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:37,938
[CITIZEN C]
Is that true?!

69
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:38,705
[CITIZEN D]
All right!

70
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:39,506
[CITIZEN E]
I was so worried!

71
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,108
[CITIZEN F] I knew
he'd make it!

72
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,515
So you're Luffy, huh?

73
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,451
Didn't expect you
to look so shrimpy.

74
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,292
I got a bone to
pick with you, kid.

75
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,394
It seems you and your
gang had a little party

76
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,329
at my place
while I was gone.

77
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,431
When I came home,
now, what did I see?

78
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,532
My house was ripped to shreds

79
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,134
and my gang
was on its knees,

80
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,270
and it's all thanks to Luffy.

81
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,438
I'll make this
as plain as can be--

82
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,508
when you mess with my boys,
you mess with Franky.

83
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,477
I'd hate to
be you right now

84
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,445
cause I'm on one hell
of a roll this week,

85
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,781
and ain't nobody
gonna stop me!

86
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,483
Now you can cry if you like,

87
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,652
but either way I'm gonna
pound you so hard

88
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,055
even your own mother won't
recognize you when I'm done.

89
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,223
[NAMI]
Shut up!

90
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,424
Huh?

91
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,228
You jerk! Give us our 200
million berries back already!

92
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,562
You hear me?!

93
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,664
Huh?

94
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,199
You want your
money back, you say?

95
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,603
Well that's a damn shame,
cause I'm afraid I spent it all!

96
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,742
You pirates are all a
bunch of sore losers!

97
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,711
Don't act all high and
mighty when you probably

98
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,713
just stole the money
from someone else!

99
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,315
[LUFFY]
The money doesn't matter.

100
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,317
Maybe not to you,
but it does to me!

101
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,786
All I care about now
is getting revenge.

102
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,524
So money or no money,
I'm gonna make you pay!

103
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,826
[FRANKY] You're stealing
my lines, you bastard!

104
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,595
Are you trying
to make me mad?!

105
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,164
[LUFFY] Whatever!
Just come down here and fight!

106
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,667
Ah! Uh-oh!
Everybody get out of the way!

107
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,036
[CITIZEN H] Franky's
going on a rampage!

108
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,771
[CITIZEN I] Run away!

109
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,479
Is he holding his breath
or something? Weird.

110
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:45,232
[CROWD screams]

111
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,242
He just spit fire!

112
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,644
Yeah, I can see
that much but how?!

113
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,216
Oh? You scared?
Having second thoughts?

114
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,584
[NAMI]
Careful. If he can do that,

115
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,219
he might have
Devil Fruit powers!

116
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,354
Okay, but that
doesn't really help!

117
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,533
If that guy did
eat a Devil Fruit,

118
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:23,170
he wouldn't just jump in the
water for no reason, would he?

119
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,140
Maybe nobody told him that
if you try to swim, you die.

120
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,107
That'd be pretty pathetic,

121
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,542
but at least it would
save us the trouble

122
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,443
of fighting that weirdo.

123
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:45,326
Aaaaahhh!

124
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:49,129
I guess he can swim!
Lucky he didn't drown, huh?

125
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,733
I didn't eat no Devil Fruit!
You think I'm crazy?!

126
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,242
Doesn't matter to me!

127
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,176
Can't surprise me.

128
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,778
I heard about that
little power of yours.

129
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,617
[FRANKY]
Strong Right!

130
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,393
What?

131
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,017
Luffy!

132
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,088
[NAMI]
Hey! Are you okay?!

133
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,232
If you don't have Devil Fruit
powers, then what are you?!

134
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,266
Huuuh?

135
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,203
You poor saps don't
know anything, now do you?

136
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,772
All right then, I'll humor you.

137
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:10,244
I'm just a normal guy
with some extra parts.

138
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,513
A cyborg, you might say.
[chuckles]

139
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,224
One of the Straw Hats did this?

140
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,194
Sure about that? Of all people.

141
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,330
Yes. And my personal
investigation

142
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,664
led to the same result.

143
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,267
To make sure, I had Lucci
contact the government

144
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,269
to confirm her
identity and bounty.

145
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,737
Coo coo! Yes.

146
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,672
They said she's a
notorious criminal,

147
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:41,475
so it's no surprise that
she'd do something dastardly

148
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,410
to our boss, coo coo!

149
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,120
Then our next course
of action is crystal clear.

150
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,257
We gotta find those rapscallions
and show them what's what.

151
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,791
What in the hell
were they thinking?

152
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,126
Don't tell me
they're pissed off

153
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,694
'cause we wouldn't
fix their ship!

154
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,795
[KAKU]
I wonder that myself.

155
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,398
But regardless of what
their motivations might be,

156
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,200
the bottom line is that
they're the culprits

157
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,701
and they need to be dealt with.

158
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,568
[PAULIE]
In other words,

159
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,703
we should just capture
the Straw Hats

160
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,206
and interrogate them ourselves
instead of wasting time

161
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:14,041
trying to figure
this crap out.

162
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,643
None of this
makes sense to me

163
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,544
but anyone who
messes with Galley-La

164
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,213
is gonna have
hell to pay.

165
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,529
[SANJI] Stay on the lookout
for Robin, okay? Chopper?

166
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,666
[CHOPPER]
Uh, yeah, right.

167
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,071
Hey, Sanji?

168
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:44,938
[SANJI]
Hm?

169
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,042
[CHOPPER] Uh, this
Aqua Laguna thing,

170
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,744
it's gonna be
pretty crazy, huh?

171
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,379
Yeah. By midnight tonight,

172
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,415
everything here is
gonna be under water.

173
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,617
So do you think that
there might be somebody--

174
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,453
like a tourist maybe--who
doesn't know it's coming yet?

175
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,654
Yeah, I guess.

176
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,591
And that guy, if he had a
boat he wanted to take care of,

177
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:06,126
the storm would
be really bad, huh?

178
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,362
[CHOPPER]
Well, I mean...

179
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:12,733
You think we should--

180
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,368
[SANJI]
Hey, that reminds me.

181
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,136
You told me you
forgot something

182
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,338
back on the Merry, didn't you?

183
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,340
A medical bag or something.

184
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:20,574
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

185
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,375
That's what
you said, right?

186
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,680
[SANJI]
Better go back then, huh?

187
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,223
I forgot something, hurray!

188
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,092
We're going back to the Merry!

189
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,680
[manly grunting]

190
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,116
[TILESTONE]
Hey!!

191
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,684
There's trouble!!

192
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,620
Shut up Tilestone, you're
way the hell too loud!

193
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,657
You fools! You're
just as loud as he is!

194
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,059
Oh!! I didn't know you were up

195
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,095
already Mr.
Iceberg--that's great!! Hahaha!

196
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:15,662
[pow]

197
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,464
[TILESTONE]
Ohh!!

198
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,632
He may be awake,

199
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,301
but that doesn't mean you
should scream his ears off!

200
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,369
Take it down a
notch or two, okay?

201
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,373
I'm sorry!! I can't
help it!! I swear!!

202
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,810
Oh!! I almost forgot!!
I gotta tell you something!!

203
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,445
[PAULIE]
Fine, but stay outside.

204
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,646
You can tell me
from over there.

205
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,615
We got trouble with
that Straw Hat guy!!

206
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,482
I dunno what happened,

207
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,484
but he got in a
big fight with Franky

208
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,653
and they're both
wrecking up the shipyard!!

209
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,323
If we don't stop 'em,
who knows what they'll do!!

210
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,595
Straw Hat again?

211
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:50,330
Well, at least we
know where to find him.

212
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,335
He's got some nerve.

213
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:57,637
I'll teach that punk to
show his face on our turf!

214
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:03,377
Now you can finally have
a bit of peace and quiet.

215
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,312
Let them take
care of Straw Hat.

216
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,349
I'll be watching over
you in the meantime,

217
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,417
so there's no need to worry.

218
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:21,595
Gum-Gum Pistol!

219
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,336
[CITIZEN J] Watch out!
It's coming down!

220
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,071
[CITIZEN K]
They're trashing the ship!

221
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,374
[CITIZEN L] Stop it!
Go fight somewhere else!

222
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,082
Luffy! Tear him to pieces,

223
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,084
and then make him
put some pants on!

224
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,419
Hey, Bro!

225
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,421
You gotta put on a good show!

226
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,765
You're a lot tougher
than I thought you'd be.

227
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:00,534
But I'm still gonna
beat you, Bikini Guy!

228
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,037
If you say so!

229
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,672
Though it's gonna
take a long ass time

230
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:07,240
with those weenie
attacks of yours!

231
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,053
[FRANKY]
Weapons Left!

232
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,427
Gum-Gum Whip!

233
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,573
I can't see-- It seems
like they both got hit!

234
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,608
No! Look who it is!

235
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,678
Who just punched me?!

236
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,818
This is too easy.

237
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:52,386
If you knew what
was good for you,

238
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,155
you woulda skipped
town a long time ago.

239
00:15:55,188 --> 00:16:03,163
You're in for it now!

240
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,367
Galley-La? Great,
that's just what I need.

241
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,136
All right, the guys from
Dock 1 finally made it!

242
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,472
Lock those losers up
and throw away the key!

243
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,706
Woooo!

244
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,608
[CROWD cheers]

245
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,218
[CITIZEN Q]
All right!

246
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,520
The foremen'll take
care of these guys!

247
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,354
[CITIZEN R]
That was close!

248
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,288
If they didn't show up,

249
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,724
the whole shipyard
was gonna get totaled!

250
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,393
Wow, lucky break!

251
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,129
Finally, someone can put
a stop to this nonsense!

252
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,431
I bet they hate Franky too!

253
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,533
[FRANKY] I'd butt out
of this if I were you.

254
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,602
Once these fists start
rockin' and rollin',

255
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,772
they don't discriminate
between pirates and shipwrights.

256
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:47,541
[KAKU] And that goes for
other people's property, too!

257
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,144
Surely you don't expect
us to stand here gobsmacked

258
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,314
while you wreck
our entire shipyard.

259
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,348
[TILESTONE] Hhhhhgh!!
I'm warning you, Franky,

260
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,383
if you don't pay for
these repairs in berries,

261
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,518
you'll pay in blood!!

262
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:00,120
[PAULIE]
All right Tilestone, calm down.

263
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:02,523
We can take care of
Franky some other time.

264
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:07,328
We've got more important
business to deal with right now.

265
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,730
Yeah. I'm lookin'
at you, Straw Hat.

266
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,632
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

267
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,534
I don't know if
you're brave or stupid,

268
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,302
but either way, you're dead.

269
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,536
Wait, what?

270
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,507
We just came here 'cause we
heard the news about Ice Pops.

271
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,142
Wasn't enough
to wreck my house

272
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,544
and beat up my boys, huh?

273
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:24,411
What's wrong?

274
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:25,379
Don't feel like a
man unless you're

275
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,314
pounding the crap out
of shipwrights, too?

276
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,415
I know that
puberty can make you

277
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,684
do some really
crazy stuff, but wow.

278
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,319
I don't even know
what's going on,

279
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,622
so stop making fun of me!

280
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:38,592

I won't go easy on you!

284

Damn it, just, go away!

285
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,344
I told you shipwrights to
stay out of this, didn't I?

286
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:01,414
I'm the one who owes
this guy a beating, not you!

287
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,419
Coo!

288
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,789
Go Galley-La! Show 'em
what you're made of!

289
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:09,623
There's no way
they can beat

290
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,059
the top 5 shipwrights
in the city!

291
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:15,296
What? Why are the shipwrights
fighting against us too?!

292
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,230
Makes me itchy.

293
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,335
[LUFFY]
What're you doing?!

294
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,637
I don't have any
reason to fight you guys!

295
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,305
Just hold on!

296
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,345
Would you look at that?

297
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,513
He's got Devil Fruit powers.

298
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,226
Hey stupid, are
you even listening?

299
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,197
How many times do
I have to tell you bozos?!

300
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,232
For the last time...

301
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,003
[FRANKY]
Straw Hat is mine, damn it!

302
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,612
Hm?

303
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:05,713
Sorry Franky,

304
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,549
but we don't have time
for your shenanigans today!

305
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:12,319
Get the hell outta my way,
you flying monkey!

306
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:16,056
[TILESTONE] You're the one
who's in the way, Franky!!

307
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,360
Oh yeeeah!

308
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:20,694
[CITIZEN V]
That's our Tilestone!

309
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,697
He's even stronger
than usual today!

310
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:37,644
Coo coo! Coo coolookoo!
Coo coo! Coo coo!

311
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,349
Hey, stop it!

312
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,602
Damn, you guys are strong.

313
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,771
But I still don't
know why we're fighting!

314
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,679
[PAULIE] Straw Hat,
I think we're the ones

315
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,514
who deserve an
explanation here, not you.

316
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,652
Someone broke into
Iceberg's house last night.

317
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,653
Shot him twice in the front

318
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,723
and three times in the
back before they left.

319
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:24,558
They were from your crew!

320
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,595
That can't be! None
of us would do that!

321
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:30,463
[thinking] I'm never
gonna settle this, am I?

322
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,755
[thinking]
That was Nico Robin.

323
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,825
There's not a single
doubt in my mind.

324
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,462
But was that masked man one
of the Straw Hats as well?

325
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:04,832
And why did they attack
me in the first place?

326
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:07,401
Surely it wasn't
about their ship.

327
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,405
No. They must've been
aiming to steal something.

328
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,140
But seeing as they
left empty handed,

329
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:16,443
I have a good idea what
they were looking for.

330
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,713
The question is if they're
working with the government

331
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,449
or if they want
it for themselves.

332

[PAULIE] I'll never forgive
what you did to Iceberg!

347
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,531
[LUFFY] How many times
do I have to tell you,

348
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,465
that wasn't us!

349
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,334
[FRANKY] Hey! Stop
ignoring me, damn it!

350
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,603
[LUFFY] We'll just have to
talk to Ice Pops in person.

351
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:23,337
[PAULIE]
Yeah right!

352
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,204
[FRANKY]
Nobody's going anywhere

353
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,407
'til I settle
things with Straw Hat!

354
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,675
[PAULIE]
Nobody cares, Franky!

355
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,443
Don't make me
beat up both of you!

356
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,111
[LUFFY] On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

357
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,113
"The Straw Hat Pirates
are the Culprits?

358
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,549
The Protectors of
the City of Water."

359
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,051
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
