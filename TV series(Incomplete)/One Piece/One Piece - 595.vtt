00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:05.880
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.322
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:39.284
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:43.580
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.624
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.251
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:51.880
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.301
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:01.514
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
Pirates reach the New World

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.474
and land on Punk Hazard.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.935
After they discover that
the Master of the island,

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:09.355
Caesar Clown, has been
performing terrible experiments,

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.149
they set off to confront him.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.567
Before they got far, however,

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.445
Luffy was approached
by Trafalgar Law.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.280
[USOPP, [CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Team up with the Heart Pirates?!

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:20.158
What's the matter with you?!

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.242
'Kay.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.453
So we're supposed to kidnap
this Master guy, right?

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:25.580
That's the quickest
way to do this?

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:27.540
Last chance to change your mind.

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.083
It's up to you, Straw Hat.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.794
Oh, don't worry.
I'm still with ya!

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.797
[laughs]

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:41.179
How does it feel to be set
free after so long, Smiley?

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.394
[LUFFY]
"Capture M!

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.814
The Pirate Alliance's
Operation Launches!"

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.324
My head is killing me.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.576
I must've hit it when
we fell or something.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.996
Ah, perhaps the same
thing happened to me.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.456
My skull aches terribly.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.750
We've wasted too much time.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.169
I wonder how the
samurai's holding up.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.338
I blame you and
this stupid side trip.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.882
[ZORO] Me? I thought it was
something we all agreed on.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.551
[BROOK] A shame we weren't
able to locate the Yeti.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.095
I thought we were close.

00:04:22.136 --> 00:04:24.514
Still, those shadows we saw
seemed quite promising,

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:25.682
wouldn't you say?

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.809
[SANJI (NAMI)] Those shadows
didn't belong to any Yeti.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.186
You said yourself that
it was an enemy attack.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.521
[BROOK]
No, I did not.

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:32.897
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Yes, you did.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.941
[BROOK]
No, I did not.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.527
I don't believe in the Yeti.

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.070
I do believe in Yeti.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.322
I don't believe or disbelieve.

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:44.033
I am content to simply
ponder its existence.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.620
Uh-- Y'know, I'm a little
impressed right now.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.039
That's a pretty mature
outlook to have.

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.625
Well, wisdom is a benefit
of advanced age.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.544
Sorry, but I'd call
that way of thinking

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:57.755
indecisiveness, not wisdom.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.592
[BROOK]
Hey! Can you hear us, samurai?

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.554
Where are you?

00:05:04.595 --> 00:05:05.722
[ZORO]
I don't see any prints

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.224
those clogs of
his would've left.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.727
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Well, this is new.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:13.771
Look how much my boobs bounce
when I do this girly run!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.524
Hey, focus! You're the one who
wants to save the damn samurai!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.067
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.945
So romantic!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:21.988
[SANJI (NAMI), ZORO]
Huh?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.114
No way!

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.158
This idiot could fall down
the whole damn mountain

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.576
for all I care.

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:27.660
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Maybe you don't like me,

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.579
but at least treat
Nami's body with respect.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.832
Will you stop bickering for
a moment and come take a look?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.918
Quickly! I see a footprint!

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.420
From the samurai's clogs?

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.921
[BROOK]
Afraid not.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:42.342
Then... one left
behind by a centaur?

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:47.180
[BROOK]
No! It's enormous.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:49.849
Well, what do you think?

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.353
This footprint. Could it have
been left by the legendary Yeti?

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.939
[BOTH]
Uh-- Not a chance. No way.

00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:59.734
Don't be so ridiculous.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.944
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Well, damn! It's true!

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:04.072
There are giant
footprints in the snow!

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:05.114
[ZORO]
Huh?

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:08.117
This is just incredible!
I can't believe it!

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.412
There are so many of them,
and they look fresh!

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.249
If we follow them,
we may find...

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:23.299
[ALL] One of nature's
greatest mysteries.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.486
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Looks like they stop here.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:48.866
[BROOK]
Do you see that?

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.327
There are two huge
shadows behind us!

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.370
Huh?!

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.623
Do you think they could be Yeti?

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.836
[ALL gasp, scream]

00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.213
[SANJI (NAMI)]
What kind of gas is this?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.757
[BROOK]
It's almost as if I'm drunk.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:10.471
I suddenly find it hard to speak
clearly, and I'm so very tired.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:12.765
It's an enemy attack!

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.435
Don't waste your time
fighting against the effects.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:17.520
KYP leaves you drunk and drowsy

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.730
no matter how high
your tolerance.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:23.734
[SCOTCH] Beneath this
cliff lies district F-16,

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:26.737
home to the terrible Ice Spikes!

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.243
Three targets down.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.499
[BROOK, ZORO, SANJI (NAMI)
scream]

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.503
[ZORO]
Hm? Spikes?

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.175
Hey, guys, any ideas?

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:48.551
[ZORO gasps]

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.515
[ZORO grunts]

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:02.190
[sighs] Well,
that was a close call.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.212
[ROCK] We left them at
the bottom of a cliff

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.005
in District F-16.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:29.133
You'll need to get out there
and recover the bodies.

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:58.329
[SUBORDINATE A] We have
arrived at district F-16.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.790
We found three of the
Straw Hats, as reported.

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:03.417
We will recover the dead bodies.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:04.335
Huh?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.962
Hate to disappoint you.

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:07.004
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.006
[SUBORDINATE B]
Hey! One of them's alive!

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.091
[SUBORDINATE C]
She's just a girl.

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:11.300
She won't fight us.

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.970
I wouldn't be so
sure if I were you.

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.305
Damn underlings!

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:22.895
[pants] I have to
be more careful.

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:24.438
Nami's body is fragile.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.775
It probably bruises easily.

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.653
I don't want to put
a single scratch on it.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:37.285
I need a smoke,
Nami, my love. Sorry.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:48.379
[SANJI (NAMI)] And now...
time to wake up, you idiots!

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.214
[thud]

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.008
[BROOK, ZORO]
Ow!

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.847
Anyway, enough hunting
nature's mysteries.

00:09:57.888 --> 00:09:59.765
Think the samurai's
around here somewhere?

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.393
Yeah. That would make
the most sense, at least.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.854
I'd imagine he's probably
still looking for his torso

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:06.147
in the vicinity of the lake.

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:08.816
[ZORO] We're not far
from the water now.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.319
[BROOK]
Can you hear us, samurai?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.989
Hey, samurai!

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.950
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:21.495
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Samurai!

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.332
Did someone kick
your ass already?

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:29.337
[SANJI (NAMI)]
You've gotta be here somewhere!

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.131
Answer us! Hello?

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.759
[BROOK] If you're able,
please say something.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.679
[BROOK sighs] I truly thought
we would find him here.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.349
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Who knows?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.850
Maybe he found his torso already

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.060
and went off to
look for his son.

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:45.311
[ZORO]
Uh--

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:49.982
[ZORO]
Hey, guys. I think this is him.

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.484
[BROOK]
What?

00:10:51.525 --> 00:10:54.945
[ZORO]
Well, crap. He's frozen solid.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.406
[SANJI (NAMI)]
One, two, three!

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:07.541
[KIN'EMON gasps, pants]

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.503
[SANJI (NAMI)] Hey, you all
right? You don't look too good.

00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:13.214
So, someone did kick your ass.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.343
[KIN'EMON] I... I suddenly
became paralyzed.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.845
I thought for certain
that death was upon me.

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.597
[SANJI (NAMI)] You mean
you got caught in a snowstorm

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.640
and froze solid?

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:27.144
[KIN'EMON wheezes]
No! The cold cannot touch me!

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:29.355
[KIN'EMON shivers]

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.941
[SANJI (NAMI) groans]
Quit being so stubborn!

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:35.695
[KIN'EMON] A warrior such as I
does not feel the cold.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.406
[ZORO] This guy's more
trouble than he's worth.

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:39.657
Whip up some clothes.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.492
Or have you already
forgotten your ability?

00:11:41.534 --> 00:11:47.164
[KIN'EMON shivering]

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.166
The truth is... The magic.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.460
I did not acquire it
without a cost.

00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.130
Because of it, I now have
a certain weakness.

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:57.049
I, well, ever since
partaking of that fruit,

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.551
when submerged in water, I--

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:01.137
You can't swim, right?
Yeah, we know.

00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:03.139
Well, you see.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.975
I believe I may know
where my torso is.

00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:08.644
I... I suspect that
you might locate it

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.521
somewhere underwater.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.647
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Underwater?

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.607
Yes, that's right.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:17.570
It feels as if the upper half
of my body is submerged.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:19.697
I see.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.825
So, that's how you wound up
here, immobilized and frozen.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.412
If your body is underwater,
then you can't use your ability.

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:28.414
You said his torso
was near the lake.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.417
If it's stumbling around
headless, it may have fallen in.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.378
That's possible, and I
believe the lake is salt water,

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.421
rather than fresh.

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:38.007
Well, his other bits are
still alive and kicking.

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:40.968
So I think we can assume it
hasn't become shark food yet.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.180
But we have no idea what kind of
creatures are in that lake.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:46.265
We better get it out
as soon as possible.

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.601
That's true. We should
waste no time.

00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.353
I... I fear that I must ask

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:54.440
if you would be
willing to, uh...

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.025
Just ask already.

00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:57.610
Damn stubborn samurai.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:58.819
We'll do it.

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:02.198
[KIN'EMON gasps]
But aren't you people pirates?

00:13:02.239 --> 00:13:04.784
And I am an utter
stranger to you.

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.828
So why are you so
willing to aid me?

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:17.004
When I saved your head,
I became responsible for you.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.255
But know this:

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:19.924
When you're back in one piece,

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:23.344
we will fight,
and I will kick your ass.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:28.015
I... I accept your aid
and your challenge.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.069
You have my gratitude.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.823
Well, well. Look who learned
how to say thank you.

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:47.201
The cold taught you manners.
What do ya know?

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.372
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Huh? What's that?

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:54.416
[BROOK]
Hmm. It's difficult to tell.

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:58.170
Oh! Those look like... centaurs.

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.005
Perhaps the ones we robbed?

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.549
Brownbeard's subordinates?

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.343
Stay with me! Keep running!

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.928
We have to get away
from the lake now!

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.806
And away from the monster that
appeared on the other side!

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.808
How has it been hiding
on the island all this time?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.519
If we can just make it to the
Master, he'll know what to do.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:15.396
[CENTAUR D] Save your breath
and focus on running.

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:17.356
If we slow down
at all, it'll get us.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.567
What? Scared of a monster?

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:21.235
Aren't you monsters, too?

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.445
[CENTAUR B gasps]
Them again?

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:25.281
Those are the pirates
who robbed us!

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:27.575
[CENTAUR D] Damn, you're right!
That one's wearing my coat!

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:30.369
[CENTAUR A] Forget about them!
Just run! Let's get to the lab.

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:33.205
[CENTAUR B] Don't forget,
they kidnapped Boss!

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.749
[CENTAURS]
We'll make you pay for that!

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.629
What's got them so worked up?

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.423
They seemed to be
running from something.

00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:45.509
[ZORO] Hmm. They looked
scared, all right.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:47.136
And they were coming
from the lake.

00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:49.013
The one we saw earlier,
right, Brook?

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:51.056
What? Yes, that's correct.

00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.600
The lake's that way.

00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.518
The same direction
we were headed.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.520
Why, what are you
thinking, Zoro?

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:59.356
[ZORO] Well, if it is
actually the same lake,

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.109
where did that
mountain come from?

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:06.196
Huh. How strange.

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:08.198
Wait! That's not a mountain.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.284
What the hell?

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:54.328
[CAESAR CLOWN laughing]

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.040
Heh. Smiley was the the
so-called chemical weapon

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:00.501
explosion that occurred
four years ago,

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:03.003
right here on Punk Hazard.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:23.023
[MONKEYS screeching]

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.952
[CAESAR CLOWN] I had been
developing a poison gas bomb,

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.413
which I dubbed H2S.

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:39.081
It was so deliciously effective

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.166
that when it was
unleashed on the island,

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:45.254
it killed everything in its path
within a matter of seconds.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:01.270
[MARINES, PRISONERS groaning]

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.210
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs] Did they
seriously believe I would

00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:28.589
purify the island of
my experiment entirely?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.883
Who would be so wasteful?

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:33.260
Well. Instead I
created a monster

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:37.639
by compressing all the gas,
and it lives here still.

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:39.349
My Smiley!

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:45.397
[laughing]

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:49.234
Yes. Punk Hazard
became uninhabitable.

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:52.071
A wasteland covered with
a blanket of death.

00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:55.324
The poisonous threat seemed
to disappear with my arrival.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:59.453
In truth, it's been
lingering here all along.

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:01.497
Waiting to be unleashed.

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:07.336
[cackling]

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:34.279
[NAMI (SANJI)] He won't get his
hands on these children again.

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:36.657
They were drugged and
used as test subjects.

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.784
They've suffered
more than enough.

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.121
This Master, though.
I'd like to make him suffer.

00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:44.414
Okay. Well, let's go
and kidnap the guy,

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.333
and you'll get your chance. Heh.

00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.584
[FRANKY]
Yeah, let's move.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.379
We need to get going, or else
we're gonna miss our window.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.590
[LUFFY] Don't worry.
I already came up with a plan.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.259
Huh?

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.552
Did you?

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:58.971
Yeah! A good one!

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.810
[MARINE H]
We did it! We got their ship!

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.813
Don't let them get
out to sea! [groans]

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:10.524
Finish them off!
Let's end this quickly!

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.943
Smoker! I don't know
what I'm doing!

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.319
How do I turn back?

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:18.365
You're getting in the way.
Just stay still for right now.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:23.495
[MARINES grunting]

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.292
Come on, you idiots,
get that door open!

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:32.129
That rat is hiding
out in his lab.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.882
We can't exterminate him
from all the way out here.

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:38.927
[MARINE G] It's no use, Smokey!
The door won't budge. Sorry!

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.221
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) sighs]
Damn it all.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.890
If only I were in my own body.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:44.933
I could get inside there easily.

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.686
Instead, I'm stuck like this.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.376
[LAW]
Room.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:21.053
[CHOPPER gasping]

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.387
[CHOPPER]
That was awesome!

00:20:22.429 --> 00:20:24.348
You're power is super cool.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.099
Did we just teleport?

00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:28.143
[LAW]
Shut up and stay inside the bag.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.729
We've almost reached
the back door of the lab.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.731
They should be working
in the main room.

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:35.025
Caesar and probably
that bird-woman.

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.902
Here's what we do.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.154
I'll try to find a way to
get them out of this place.

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.572
While we're gone,
you look around

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:43.075
and see what you can
learn about the drug.

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:44.284
I don't understand.

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.371
It seems like you've got pretty
easy access to the Master.

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:49.373
And your power is strong.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:52.376
Wouldn't it be simpler to
go ahead and capture him?

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:55.712
Then we'd have plenty of time
to find out about the drug.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.965
I can't take him down myself.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.967
There are certain
circumstances preventing that,

00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:02.094
which is why I involved you.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.305
[LAW] You don't need to
know the specifics.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:08.267
All I'm asking your crew
to do is kidnap him.

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:10.102
I'll take care of the rest.

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:14.564
[CENTAURS, MARINES yelling]

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:16.733
Hey, you guys, look over there!

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:17.609
[LAW]
Hm?

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.569
[gasps]

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.530
What in the hell is that thing?

00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.073
[MARINE J]
It's headed right for us!

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.866
[MARINE K]
Is it some kind of missile?

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:27.703
Nope. It's not a missile!

00:21:35.752 --> 00:21:39.798
Go. Cien Fleurs. Wing!

00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:44.344
[LUFFY]
Wham!

00:21:44.386 --> 00:21:46.430
[FRANKY]
Yeah!

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.807
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.892
What the hell? It talked!

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:53.520
But missiles can't talk!

00:22:02.612 --> 00:22:03.780
[CENTAUR G]
Huh?

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.157
[CENTAUR G gasps]

00:22:05.198 --> 00:22:06.742
[FRANKY]
Hot damn!

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:09.202
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:15.000
[chuckles] Killer
shortcut there, Luffy.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.795
All right, come on out,
Master dude!

00:22:18.837 --> 00:22:20.297
Or else we'll
break into your lab

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:23.467
before we kick your
ass and kidnap you!

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:26.303
Luffy, that was
supposed to be secret.

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:27.304
Him again!

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.180
[gasps]

00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:29.806
Crap, it's the Straw Hat crew!

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.308
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.268
[CHOPPER]
Go, Luffy, go!

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.020
Damn loud mouth!

00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:38.398
Are you capable of
doing anything quietly?

00:23:02.506 --> 00:23:06.301
[LUFFY] Where are you,
Master? Show yourself!

00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:13.183
[laughing]

00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:18.855
[NARRATOR]
Luffy and friends battle it out

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.817
with the Navy's G-5,
led by Smoker.

00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:23.860
After the intense
battle concludes,

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:26.905
a way inside the laboratory
suddenly appears.

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:30.325
Just then, Caesar's deadly
Smiley weapons rain down,

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:34.329
one after another, plunging
everyone into fear and chaos.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:35.956
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:37.874
"On the Verge of Annihilation!

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.377
A Deadly Monster
Comes Flying In!"

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:43.380
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
