1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,224
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,727
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:45,398
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:50,403
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,340
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,113
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,553
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,422
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,427
[PERONA] Hey, Kumacy? Kumacy!

48
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,095
The Risky Brothers
should be delivering

49
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,597
the coffin as we speak.

50
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:18,798
Pick it up from them

51
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,100
and take it straight to our
Master over at the Dance Hall.

52
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,735
Got it?

53
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,438
Did you hear me?
Don't just stare.

54
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,406
[KUMACY] Yes.

55
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,775
Ugh, that's gross!
I told you not to talk!

56
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,743
I'm heading to the
Straw Hat's ship to clean out

57
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,278
their treasure collection
while they're busy

58
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,446
with all the zombies.

59
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,448
Let me know if
anything strange happens.

60
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,616
Okeydoke?

61
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,419
[chuckles] There you go!

62
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,888
You're much cuter when you
keep that ugly mouth shut.

63
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,489
[KUMACY] Take care out there.

64
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,593
[PERONA] Hey! Did you
just mumble something at me?

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,494
[FRANKY] I bet that
old guy was right

66
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,597
and Moria's been watching
us this whole time.

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,298
We gotta keep our
eyes peeled for traps,

68
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,133
or we'll end up like our cook.

69
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,835
We're already
missing half our crew.

70
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,738
Wouldn't surprise me if Moria
was trying to split us up.

71
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,906
[OINKCHUCK chuckles]

72
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,507
Probably just
Sanji's fault.

73
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,310
He is pretty dumb.
Still, can't believe we found

74
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,313
one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea out here.

75
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,481
My question is:

76
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,650
What're we gonna do if one
of our shadows gets stolen.

77
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,452
Now that would be interesting.

78
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,787
Well, don't look at me.
I'm not squealing.

79
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,257
I know I promised that
old guy I'd beat up Moria,

80
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,425
but maybe that should
be second on the list.

81
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,327
Gotta look out
for my crew first.

82
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,963
Hahaha! I can't tell you
where your friends are,

83
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,666
but wherever it is, they're
in for a world of pain.

84
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,301
But I wouldn't
worry about them--

85
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,336
you're not much
better off yourself.

86
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,804
You'll see.

87
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:33,840
Okay, Wall Pig,

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,808
you're gonna stop oinking
and start guiding us.

89
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,310
Got it?

90
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,279
[CHOPPER] Are you okay?

91
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,316
Behind you!
Chopper! Look out!

92
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,552
No! Chopper!

93
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,654
Perhaps you should worry less

94
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,823
about your friends and
a bit more about yourself.

95
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,235
[DOGGUIN] Don't you dare!

96
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,738
[ZOMBIE BULLDOG] Hey stupid!

97
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,674
Who's side are you on, anyway?

98
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,710
[ZOMBIE RAM] I know you're new
here, but that girl's a pirate!

99
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,644
Kick her ass!

100
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,546
[DOGGUIN] I don't
care who this lady is

101
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,814
or where she came from.

102
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,518
I don't even care if I have
to disobey our Master's orders.

103
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,689
'Cause even if it kills me,
I'll never kick a woman!

104
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,856
Stupid pig!

105
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,559
Just tell us where you hid
our friends already! C'mon!

106
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,361
Like I said before.

107
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,863
Ask all you like--
I don't know a thing!

108
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,933
When we get our cook back,
we're making bacon out of you.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,568
Perhaps, they were strangled

110
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,271
and so they can't
call out for help.

111
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,839
No more predictions out of you!

112
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,541
They're way too depressing!

113
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,511
[LUFFY] Hey, wait a second.
When did we last see Zoro?

114
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,449
[LUFFY]
"The Vanishing Straw Hat Crew!

115
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,884
A Mysterious Swordsman Appears!"

116
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,963
I don't like this.

117
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,065
I wonder what could
have happened to them.

118
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,767
It's certainly strange.

119
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,942
[FRANKY] There's nowhere
for them to go!

120
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,411
They were walking
right next to us!

121
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,613
[ROBIN] Perhaps ghosts
had something to do with it.

122
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,451
[ROBIN] I hope they
didn't lose any limbs.

123
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,486
[FRANKY] Dammit!

124
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,487
Stop with all that creepy-talk
and start thinking

125
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,756
about how we can find
those guys and save 'em!

126
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:38,297
[clanking noises]

127
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,507
[crash]

128
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,482
[LUFFY] Zoro! Sanji!
Man! Where did they go?

129
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,651
This is no time
to screw around!

130
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,752
What's wrong with you?

131
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,787
[LUFFY] Hey!

132
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,487
Everybody knows if
there's armor laying around,

133
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,122
you gotta put it on and wear it!

134
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,824
It's like fulfilling
a man's dream!

135
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,993
Wha--? Oh, wow.

136
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,161
That's a good point!

137
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,329
[LUFFY] Don't tell me when
you made a body out of iron,

138
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,932
you gave yourself a cold,
iron heart, too!

139
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,367
I'm sorry! You're right!

140
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,601
Even if I have fists of iron,

141
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,704
that's no replacement for a
heart that's full of dreams!

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,642
[LUFFY] Yeah! Song time!

143
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,644
Realizing I've lost
something so precious

144
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,647
has blown a cold wind through
the rusty cracks of my heart.

145
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,883
I call this one Steel
Cyborg Traveler Blues.

146
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,352
I think you've forgot
the situation here.

147
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,520
[ROBIN] Hey.

148
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,355
[ROBIN] There's a
large hall up ahead.

149
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,523
[LUFFY] Really?

150
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,858
[gasps]

151
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,028
Hahahahaha!

152
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,672
I see. That's what this is.

153
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,875
[LUFFY] Robin! Are Usopp
and the others here?

154
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,544
No. But take
a look at this room.

155
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,849
We should be outside
once we pass through here.

156
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,750
[LUFFY] Whoa!
What is this place?

157
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,986
[FRANKY] Looks like
some kind of arena.

158
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,190
It's actually a lot more
complicated than that.

159
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,593
Oh, but don't worry
about the details.

160
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,027
You'll find out soon enough,

161
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,564
since you've conveniently
walked right into our trap!

162
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,108
[LUFFY] Franky!

163
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,582
Who is that?

164
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,924
Oh! A haunted suit of armor!

165
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,759
It must be a zombie.

166
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,463
It has spears piercing its body,
but it's still moving around.

167
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,132
[FRANKY] So now the zombies
are arming themselves?

168
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,452
Great. 'Cause this
wasn't bad enough!

169
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:16,005
Strong Right!

170
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,294
Right through the wall!

171
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,371
[FRANKY] So what if
you can use a sword!

172
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,207
[FRANKY] Weapons Left!

173
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:04,186
[FRANKY]
Stop wasting my time, punk. Huh?

174
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,793
[LUFFY] Eh?! Man, he's tough!

175
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,070
[FRANKY] What the hell?

176
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
[LUFFY] Did he just--?

177
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,549
Impossible.

178
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,735
A little cut from a dead
guy ain't gonna kill me!

179
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,751
[LUFFY] Stay down already!

180
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:09,719
That guy is different.

181
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,587
He's a lot tougher
than those knuckleheads

182
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,689
we beat the crap out of earlier.

183
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,125
Hahahaha!

184
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,793
Now you will
know real terror!

185
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,596
You'll see what makes a
zombie truly frightening!

186
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,698
Hey! Why're you
way over there?

187
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,467
They don't feel
even a hint of pain--

188
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:25,434
they never get tired.

189
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,903
And these Zombie Generals
offer even more.

190
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,272
They all made quite a name
for themselves in battle

191
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,142
before they died and
were brought back to life.

192
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,112
Among them are a knight,
a wicked criminal,

193
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,548
a samurai, a pirate,
and also a gunslinger!

194
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:40,816
Just imagine the possibilities!

195
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,485
These ruthless fighters combined

196
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:45,321
with the relentless power
of the undead.

197
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,289
Not a single member
of your crew

198
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,724
is going to escape this place.

199
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,393
Give up! You're done!

200
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,228
Shut up, pig!

201
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,230
[OINKCHUCK] Wall Zombie!

202
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,301
He locked us in here!

203
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,838
Then we can only
move forward, but--

204
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,487
[LUFFY]
Whooooa!!

205
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,657
Speaking from experience
of fighting one Zombie General.

206
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,460
I'd say we're in
pretty deep crap here.

207
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,329
[LUFFY] There's armored
guys everywhere!

208
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,665
Trying to take down
these corpses one at a time

209
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,434
doesn't seem like the way to go.

210
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,968
But trying to take
them all on at once

211
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,937
seems like an even dumber idea.

212
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,505
This ain't good.

213
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,940
[LUFFY] Yeah. You got a point.

214
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,509
And this isn't even the
fight we came in here for.

215
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:43,212
If we somehow manage
to escape this hall,

216
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,514
we'll most likely end up
outside in the courtyard.

217
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,348
[LUFFY] Right.

218
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:47,683
Then let's split up
and meet there.

219
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,218
And be careful.

220
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,886
I don't want anyone
else to disappear.

221
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:51,854
Got it?

222
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:53,689
[ROBIN] Got it.

223
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:57,493
Attack!

224
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,794
Let's go!

225
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,729
Yeah!

226
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,633
Lola! Lola!

227
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,206
Dammit! Where'd that warthog go?

228
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,681
Lola!

229
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,749
[LOLA] Absa-lover!

230
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,389
Cut it out,
you crazy beast!

231
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,525
Don't you listen
to a word I say?

232
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,994
[panting heavily]

233
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:35,698
I told you. This is the
woman I'm going to marry!

234
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:44,406
[LOLA] Master Ab is mine. Mine!

235
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:48,377
[LOLA] That hussy cat-burglar
will never have you!

236
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,348
[ABSALOM] Lola! Stop it!

237
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:54,683
I'm coming for you!

238
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:57,353
[ABSALOM] Stop it,
dammit! Don't do this!

239
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,723
[DOGGUIN] If any of you so
much as touch this lady,

240
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,258
you'll regret it!

241
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,371
What the heck
is going on here?

242
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:18,574
Isn't that penguin
one of the zombies?

243
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,776
Did you notice
his fighting style?

244
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,814
It can't be.

245
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:26,815
Hey! Dumbass!

246
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:29,485
You're really starting
to piss me off, chum!

247
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,554
You're fighting the
wrong enemy, idiot!

248
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:33,656
The girl is one of our targets!

249
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,927
[DOGGUIN] Anyone who
mistreats a lady is gonna get

250
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,297
a crash course in table
manners from yours truly.

251
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,733
You got that?
You crappy zombies!

252
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:50,306
That dog-penguin is...
It's him. I'm sure of it!

253
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,202
[PERONA] The ship of the
famous Straw Hat pirates.

254
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,772
The crew that defeated
Crocodile and many others.

255
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:15,873
Awesome!

256
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,475
I can't wait to see what
goodies they've got hidden here!

257
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:22,146
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo horo!

258
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,683
[ZORO] Hey! Can anybody hear me?

259
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,318
Let me outta here, dammit!

260
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:30,387
Come on!
Cut me loose, you bastards!

261
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,491
I can't see anything in here.

262
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,528
Just where the
hell am I, anyway?

263
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:42,199
What's the big idea?

264
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,368
Hey! What are you doing?
Let go of me!

265
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:47,338
You're dead, whoever you are.

266
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,174
What is this?

267
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:54,211
What's with that light?

268
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:57,548
Answer me, damn it!

269
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:00,517
What the--?

270
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:18,736
[FRANKY] Strong Right!

271
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:25,175
You don't know who
you're messin' with!

272
00:16:32,716 --> 00:16:34,551
Trienta Fleur!

273
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,860
Move it!

274
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,534
[LUFFY] Now! Come on!

275
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,918
Stay down, already!

276
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:10,888
I don't have time for
this, you damn zombies!

277
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,799
[ROBIN] Clutch!

278
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,775
There. Now stay outta the way!

279
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,474
[ROBIN] It doesn't seem
like we're making any headway.

280
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:04,608
Dammit!

281
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:08,178
Kicking their asses over
and over is gonna wear me out.

282
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:12,182
They're stubborn, huh?
What a pain.

283
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:21,391
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

284
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,700
[MALE VOICE] One-Sword Style!

285
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,903
36 Caliber Phoenix!

286
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,212
That move! Zoro!

287
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,019
Zoro! What's your problem?

288
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,587
That's dangerous!

289
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:55,859
Hmm?

290
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,275
Scars on the back are the
shame of a swordsman, but...

291
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:15,746
...I've got scars
on my entire body!

292
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,915
[LUFFY] You look different,
but you are Zoro, right?

293
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,750
[JIGORO] Nu-uh, I'm Jigoro!

294
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,719
[LUFFY] Jigoro?
You mean you're not Zoro?

295
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,955
Then why are you using
Zoro's sword moves?

296
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,857
I'm tired of hearing
your loud mouth,

297
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,458
you damn pirate.

298
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,361
You are my sworn enemy.

299
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:33,764
I am?

300
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,433
I'm gonna cut you
into little pieces!

301
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,769
[LUFFY] Man,
you're a lot like Zoro!

302
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,604
Only dumber!

303
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,953
[FRANKY] Bastard!

304
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:07,898
[FRANKY] Holy crap!
There's no end to these guys!

305
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,003
Franky! Quick! Grab hold!

306
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,986
It's no use!
They're still coming!

307
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:39,129
I know what'll stop 'em.
Fresh Fire!

308
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:41,765
[CAPTAIN JOHN]
Prepare the buckets!

309
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,501
[FRANKY] No way!

310
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,940
Hey! Look out!

311
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,544
How about
some Once Fleur!

312
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,047
And Slam!

313
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,665
[ROBIN] Where's Luffy?

314
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,867
[FRANKY] It looks like he
wasn't able to make it out.

315
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,168
I don't see him anywhere!

316
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,037
Probably 'cause he's
wearing that stupid armor!

317
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,905
He blends in with
the rest of 'em!

318
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,475
[FRANKY] Unless-- Wait.

319
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,878
You don't think he
disappeared, too, do ya?

320
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,880
It's not a good idea
to wait and find out.

321
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,382
Those zombies will
catch up to us any second.

322
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,386
[FRANKY] Hey! Straw Hat!

323
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,388
[LUFFY]
Arrrrghh!!!

324
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:41,591
This sucks! Stop it!
Lemme outta here!

325
00:21:41,658 --> 00:21:42,826
[FRANKY] What the--?

326
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,928
[LUFFY] Lemme go, you bastards!

327
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:47,064
Open up this box and let me out!

328
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:47,898
Is that a coffin?

329
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,167
[LUFFY]
Oh, you're gonna regret this!

330
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:54,771
[ROBIN] That voice--It's Luffy!

331
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:57,908
[FRANKY] Wait, you mean Straw
Hat's inside of that thing?

332
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,176
C'mon, Robin! After it!

333
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:00,077
[ROBIN] Right!

334
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,112
What are you doing
in that box, dumbass?

335
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:04,848
Why'd you go and get
yourself caught like that?

336
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,583
Hey! Straw Hat!

337
00:22:07,017 --> 00:22:08,919
[TARARAN] That's far enough.

338
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:20,097
[TARARAN] Hey, Hey!
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

339
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,737
All those stories you've
heard about Spider Monkeys?

340
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,704
You're looking at one!
That's me!

341
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:28,972
A giant spider!

342
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,041
Even for a monkey,
that's damn big.

343
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,142
It's a monster!

344
00:22:32,209 --> 00:22:34,945
[LUFFY] I'm warning you!
Lemme outta this box or else!

345
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:38,582
Ah! Got another one!

346
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:40,784
It sounds like it hit the floor!

347
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,618
Damn it!

348
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,754
What are you punks
gonna do to him?

349
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:46,156
Heee. Oh, don't worry.

350
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:50,093
You'll find out soon enough,
since you're gonna be next.

351
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:54,464
But I'd be more worried
about myself, if I were you!

352
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,642
You've got me in front of you,

353
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:09,079
and armored warrior zombies
closing in from behind.

354
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:13,116
There's no escape!
Prepare for annihilation!

355
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,857
[ABSALOM] You stupid zombie!

356
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:22,659
Don't you know I'm your leader?

357
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,693
Get out of my way!

358
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,495
[DOGGUIN] Even the
mightiest island must relent

359
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,863
to the whipping
winds of my heart!

360
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,166
That's right!
This is a love hurricane!

361
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,135
[ABSALOM] Would you shut up and
move so I can capture my bride?

362
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,137
[DOGGUIN] I won't let you
lay a hand on that lady.

363
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,872
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

364
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,174
"Chivalry Remains!

365
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,843
The Traitorous
Zombie Protects Nami!"

366
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,179
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
