1
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,058
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,762
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:45,266
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,237
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,439
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,540
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:57,111
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,380
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,616
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,053
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,256
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,695
Wait! Now I get it!

13
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,130
Get what?

14
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,398
We can save Robin.

15
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,833
As long as I'm here we
can save her, dammit!

16
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,967
Whoa, okay.

17
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,736
Do you really have to get
so carried away about it?

18
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,772
[USOPP]
C'mon, let's go!

19
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,472
[SPANDAM]
You are just determined

20
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,542
to keep making me repeat this.

21
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:32,580
There isn't even a microscopic
residue of hope left for you.

22
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,249
Sure, we might've heard what
could've been a voice earlier,

23
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,284
but I haven't seen
anyone, have you?

24
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,752
If there was anyone back there,

25
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,355
Lucci is probably killing
them right about now.

26
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,256
Get it?

27
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,258
I doubt that we'll
ever agree on this.

28
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,827
So there's no sense
in us discussing it.

29
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,396
And I don't have time
for talking anyway.

30
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,199
Gum-Gum Gatling!

31
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,100
Stamp! Whip!

32
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,203
Spear!

33
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,615
I'm a wolf, you dolt.

34
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:11,184
I won't stop chasing you
until you're in my jaws.

35
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,125
[JABRA]
Still hanging in there, huh?

36
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,361
[SANJI]
I'm not going anywhere pal.

37
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:23,630
I'm not about
get killed, either.

38
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,635
And I'm not gonna forgive you.

39
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,270
Forgive me?

40
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,475
Upset with the way
we've treated Robin?

41
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,443
Gettin' all emotional
will only clutter up

42
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,178
your mind during a fight.

43
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,047
Don't waste all of your
precious time pitying

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,116
that hopeless fool of a woman

45
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,717
when you should be
busy trying to think up

46
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,753
a way to get out of here alive.

47
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,556
[SANJI]
Watch your damn mouth, wolf.

48
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,625
You don't wanna see me mad.

49
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,160
I tend to overheat when I'm mad.

50
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,638
The heat of its destructive
power burns hotter

51
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,340
than the flames of hell.

52
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,309
Diable Jambe!

53
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,679
Wait!

54
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,747
Flambage--

55
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,186
Shot!

56
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,800
God may have created food.

57
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:39,005
But the Devil created spices.

58
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,542
If you think that kick was hot,

59
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,344
my heart was
burning even hotter.

60
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,349
[LUFFY]

61
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,398
Oni Giri!

62
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,445
What's Moss Head doing up there?

63
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,780
He's gonna bring the
whole damn tower down.

64
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,392
[Gates of Justice
Underground passage]

65
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,193
Who wrote this?

66
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:38,431
It says "Gates of Justice."
Guess I might as well follow it.

67
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,403
Nami and Usopp are probably

68
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,538
on their way to Robin already.

69
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,477
If this is the key they need,

70
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,379
I can't keep them waiting.

71
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,082
Better hurry.

72
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,623
Can't you move any faster?

73
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,200
This is it!

74
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,169
At long last, the
Bridge of Hesitation!

75
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,473
Look, Nico Robin!

76
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:31,986
That's right.

77
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,788
The Gates of
Justice are opening!

78
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,493
It took long enough,

79
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,163
and I admit, it was
scary for a while there,

80
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,798
but I finally made it.

81
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,267
Once I step through those gates,

82
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,103
I'll be the
government's hero. No.

83
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,272
I will be a hero to
the entire world!

84
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,345
The bridge leading to the
gate is rising as we speak.

85
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,180
Can you hear it?

86
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,482
It's calling out to its hero!

87
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,326
It's beautiful!

88
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,696
A path into the horizon as
radiant as my shining future!

89
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,102
Although, for you it must look
like a path straight to hell.

90
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,639
Right? That's what you're
thinking, isn't it?

91
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,774
Well, take a good look!

92
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,582
No!

93
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:36,316
Hey, stop squirming around!

94
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,486
Ow, that hurt!

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,023
Stupid woman. Come back here!

96
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,527
Enough!

97
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,363
I'm sick of chasing
you around, damn it!

98
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,365
For the last time,
you can't escape,

99
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,101
so give it a rest,
you obstinate cow!

100
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:54,935
Are you stupid?

101
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,271
Do I need to remind
you who I am?

102
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,072
Huh?

103
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,241
I'm the hero of
the entire world!

104
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,209
The whole damn world!

105
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,178
And that means
I'm different than you,

106
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,479
better than you!

107
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,314
While I have a
bright future ahead,

108
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,050
you're condemned to die
without a shred of hope!

109
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,120
You're nothing but a
stepping stone to me!

110
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,623
Have I finally gotten that
through your thick skull?

111
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,192
Or do I need to keep
grinding it in for you?

112
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:33,306
[ROBIN] Luffy. Everyone.
I still believe in you.

113
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,179
C'mon! Hurry! Hurry!

114
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,147
There's no point if
I don't make it in time!

115
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,783
Is that the exit?

116
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,658
Ten minutes until we arrive!

117
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,492
All hands are ready, sir!

118
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,128
[OFFICER]
All ships confirm positions

119
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,496
and prepare for attack!

120
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,164
[CREW]
Yes sir!

121
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,267
Now get up! Show some dignity!

122
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,537
You're not going
to ruin this for me!

123
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,309
Did I make it?

124
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,586
Whoa, calm down, Straw Hat!

125
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,754
Huh. It's Franky!

126
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,823
I got enough jerks to
deal with--get lost!

127
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:23,657
What?

128
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,358
You mean you're
still playin' tough

129
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,260
after all we've been through?

130
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,195
We're bros now!
Just deal with it!

131
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,633
Lucci, huh?

132
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,236
He givin' you a hard
time, or something?

133
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,770
By the way,
I brought you two keys.

134
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,772
Though I guess Robin's not here.

135
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,207
Should I lend you a hand?

136
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,075
No.

137
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,043
Leave this guy to me.

138
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,246
You should go after Robin.

139
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,082
You can get to the
Gates of Justice

140
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,117
through that door
behind the pigeon guy.

141
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,153
Robin left a while back,
so we're running out of time.

142
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,323
Keep going and don't look back.

143
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:01,628
You can super count
on me, brother.

144
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,679
Listen, just so
we're straight here,

145
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:21,648
despite my appearance,
I prefer meat.

146
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,052
Well, just so
we're straight here,

147
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,786
I really don't give a damn!

148
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:29,924
Hm?

149
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,558
[ZORO]
Anyway, enough small talk.

150
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,594
I gotta get that key.

151
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,396
If I can't make it in time,
this is all for nothing.

152
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,202
Two Sword Style Nigiri.

153
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,742
Are you supposed to get stronger

154
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,178
when you wear that
bandanna on your head?

155
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,746
Let's find out.

160

[KAKU] You've given
yourself a blind spot!

161

Giraffe Scythe!

162
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,380
Iron Body Edge Wise.

163
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,383
What?

164
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,396
There's no blind
spots on a square.

165
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:44,531
So what?

166
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,567
If you can't move, who cares?

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,402
You're so naïve!

168
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,571
Perhaps I should
remind you of something.

169
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,239
Yeah?

170
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,279
Unlike humans, giraffes
have four legs. Tempest Kick!

171
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,682
Are you gonna fight me,
or just sit there?

172
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:02,616
What do you mean?

173
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,619
Take a look!
My attack has already begun!

174
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,225
First the slashes go up,
they deflect off the ceiling,

175
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:15,028
and then finally,
they come raining down!

176
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,697
Giraffe Shower!

177
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,138
Iron Body.

178
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,549
There's too many of them.
Damn it! I can't block!

179
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,169
Nose Pistol!

180
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,396
Bastard.

181
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,167
You're quite resilient for a
human. But I'm a giraffe, boy!

182
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,272
That your superhero name?
"Giraffe Boy"?

183
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,141
Giraffe Boy?
It's just "Giraffe", fool!

184
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,143
[ZORO]
Now it's "Giraffe Fool?"

185
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,079
You're the fool!
I'm the giraffe! Got it?

186
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:41,548
[ZORO]
Listen to yourself.

187
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,782
[KAKU]
Hm?

188
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:45,219
[ZORO] Who the hell cares if
you're Giraffe Boy or whatever?

189
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:49,422
If you're a swordsman, then you
let your blade speak for you!

190
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,126
If you think you can
get under my skin,

191
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,161
you're just wasting your time.

192
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,263
I'm not getting under your skin.

193
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:59,066
I'm gonna cut
straight through it.

194
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:03,737
And if you use your Iron Body,
I'll cut through that, too!

195
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,325
[KAKU]
Hmph.

196
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,728
You're quite the
comedian, aren't you?

197
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,365
So, you'll cut
through my Iron Body?

198
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,767
I can't imagine how.

199
00:15:33,968 --> 00:15:39,005
Just sit back and watch,
Giraffe Boy. I'll show you.

200
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,379
One-Sword Style Sword Draw.

201
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,287
Lion Song!

202
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,024
Tempest Kick! Dragon Cut!

203
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,664
Iron Body isn't the issue.

204
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,233
If you can't cut me at all,
it doesn't matter

205
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,135
if my body's iron or not.

206
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,439
[ZORO]
You're right.

207
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,175
I'll have to take a
different approach.

208
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,417
One Gorilla! Two Gorilla!

209
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,685
Now again!

210
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:30,090
Three-Sword Style.

211
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,826
A test of strength
this time, is it?

212
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,662
Sounds fun to me!

213
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,162
Nose Pistol!

214
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,100
Two Gorilla Slash!

215
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,508
[KAKU]
This is truly a fearsome attack!

216
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,356
[ZORO] You never thought
you might lose, did you?

217
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,793
You can't even imagine that
I might be stronger than you.

218
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,627
Well, it's time to wake up!

219
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,400
I'll make you face the truth.

220
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,569
I could say the same thing!

221
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:24,111
Eat this! Gum-Gum Gatling!

222
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,512
Paper Art.

223
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,319
Gum-Gum Pistol!

224
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,286
Shave!

225
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,533
Straw Hat!

226
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,472
Tempest Kick!

227
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,380
Weapons Left!

228
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,116
Shave!

229
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:05,252
[FRANKY]
Uh-oh!

230
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,421
Gum-Gum Rocket!

231
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:12,559
What happened?

232
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,062
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

233
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,701
Hey, you got him! Good!

234
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,503
Hold him right there
and I'll blast him!

235
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,570
Forget it!

236
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,641
I said I'd take care of him,
right? Come on! Go!

237
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,177
Stick to the plan and
leave this guy to me!

238
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,646
Get serious, man!
This dude's too strong!

239
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,682
We gotta work as
a team on this one!

240
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:35,749
That's enough!

241
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:40,421
This is my fight, not yours!
I can't lose to him!

242
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,755
For the last time.

243
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,458
You gotta get out of here
and find Robin now!

244
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,493
I'm counting on you!

245
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,397
If you can't help her,
she's gone for good!

246
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,400
This is the only
chance we're gonna get!

247
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,269
Straw Hat.

248
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,571
You hear me?

249
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:01,408
Stop now, sea train!

250
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,377
Give me Tom back!

251
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,547
[LUCCI]
Ridiculous.

252
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,252
You can't escape.

253
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,122
[FRANKY]
Are you sure?

254
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:19,193
Of course I am! Go!

255
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:23,430
All right then. Good luck!

256
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:27,567
I already told you.
You can't escape!

257
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,437
Moon Walk!

258
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,107
Shave!

259
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:36,744
Damn it!

260
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,511
Finger Pistol.

261
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:51,358
Get back here. If you
wanna fight, then you fight me!

262
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,529
[KAKU] You still haven't seen

263
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:59,667
the true, wild,
strength of a giraffe.

264
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,636
[ZORO] Then stop talking
and show me already.

265
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,138
It would be my pleasure.

266
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:09,709
Observe, for this is
the power of nature!

267
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,380
Giraffe Cannon!

268
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,717
[ZORO] There's nothing
natural about that.

269
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,386
Extreme Nose Pistol!

270
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,221
Giraffe Blast!

271
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,557
[ZORO]
It stretched!

272
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:28,295
But it's like I said. That neck
of yours is your weak point!

273
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,130
Keep telling yourself
that!

274
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:33,166
Tempest Kick! Spinning
White Blade!

275
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,339
Why don't you worry

276
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,375
about your own weak
points instead of mine?

277
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,344
What's with this guy?

278
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:45,346
These attacks just
keep getting weirder.

279
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:49,649
You won't get away
next time. Giraffe Cannon!

280
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:53,521
[KAKU]
Damn it!

281
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:56,090
I pushed my neck in so far, it
made my arms and legs pop out!

282
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,359
What kind of messed up
body have you got?

283
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:00,194
It's like when you
cram dough through

284
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:02,162
a little hole and it
comes out as noodles!

285
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,231
Like a pasta machine!

286
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,535
[ZORO]
Hm?

287
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,438
Pasta Machine!

288
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,641
[ZORO] Don't act like you
did that on purpose!

289
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,309
A long neck is nice,

290
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:19,079
but long limbs like
these are handy as well!

291
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,648
A pro like me can turn even

292
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:24,485
the most unexpected situations
into fresh opportunities!

293
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,220
Behold as I unleash

294
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:29,723
a devastating new
long-range technique!

295
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:32,726
Giraffe Blast!

296
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,628
That's the same
attack you did before!

297
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,766
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

298
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,670
Three-Sword Style Tatsu Maki!

299
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:43,737
Iron Body!

300
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:49,676
It's too strong. Shave!

301
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,117
Moon Walk!

302
00:21:57,318 --> 00:22:02,055
[ZORO] Now what?
He can't be running away.

303
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:07,027
Pasta Machine!

304
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,332
Thank you for waiting.

305
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,404
Never mind the neck.

306
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,673
If I can control the
reach of all four limbs,

307
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,175
my blades will be unstoppable!

308
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:27,081
Perhaps you were so distracted
by my Giraffe Powers,

309
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:30,584
that you forgot I'm a master
of the Four Sword Style!

310
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:33,720
You've done well thus far,
but this battle is over now!

311
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,461
[ZORO] Even if you have the
power of a wild animal.

312
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,131
Even if you can attack
with that long neck of yours.

313
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:48,235
Even if you can use
the Four-Sword Style.

314
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:57,477
What? He deflected
all four blades?

315
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,449
None of those
things will give you

316
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,185
the strength it
takes to defeat me!

317
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,128
[ZORO]
Nine Sword Style!

318
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,195
[KAKU]
There's no point in trying!

319
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,764
You'll never defeat me!

320
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,831
No matter where you hide,

321
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,634
you won't escape the power
of my strongest attack!

322
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,369
The Sky Slicer!

323
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,370
[ZORO]
I commend you.

324
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,574
Suffering is welcome on
the path to bloodshed.

325
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,442
[KAKU]
What? I must be seeing things!

326
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,512
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:
"Demon God Zoro!

327
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:34,815
An Incarnation of Asura
Born from Fighting Spirit."

328
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
