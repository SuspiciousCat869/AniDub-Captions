you've seen before.

that look alike no matter
where you go.

I don't think so.

81
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,523
That exact same ship was
wrecked in the very first place

82
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,725
we dropped anchor.

of that goddess on the bow.

00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,497
Have we really come full circle

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,233
to the exact same place
we started from?

87
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,002
[ZORO] That's why
I asked if you were sure

88
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,470
we were going forward earlier.

00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,839
We were going straight!

91
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,574
How can you possibly
see which way is straight

She shot the cannon forward,
but it landed right behind us!

00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,869
As I thought.

98
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,505
The fabric of space
is distorted here.

99
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,773
What does that mean?

100
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,942
It's something that I remembered
reading from that book earlier.

101
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,411
See, the inside of
the Rainbow Mist

102
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,213

itself like a maze.

He won't necessarily end up
back in the exact location

106
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,526
he started from.

107
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,294

108
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,035
Okay, I get it now.

109
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,270
It's a mystery mist.

110
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,073
No matter which way you go, you
just end up where you started.

111
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,474
Yeah, that's it.

112
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,608
A mystery mist.

113
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,378
I'm not quite certain you
understand it completely.

114
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,548
Well, we get the part about not
being able to get out of here.

115
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,451
We don't really have
to get out of here, anyway.

116
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,219
It's fun!

117
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:56,055
We should join up

With all those kids?

119
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,626
Don't you think that the best
way to get out of Ape's Concert

120
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,062
is to ask the people who
have been in here for so long

121
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,163
and made it their territory?

122
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,298
[USOPP]
Well, that makes sense.

123
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,934
But how are we supposed
to find out where they all are?

124
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,469
We could ask that boy.

125
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,571
He's right over there.

126
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,109
How did she
find out where I was?

Now would you be a dear,

130
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,652
and take us to wherever
your leader is hiding.

131
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,691
[IAN laughs]

132
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,493
Impossible!

133
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,995
You say that
Henzo has come back,

134
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,697
and he's become
an old man now?

135
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,166
That's a pretty lame joke
if you ask me kid.

136
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,268
[RONGO] I'm telling you,
it isn't a joke!

137
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,637
Yeah. He fell into
the sea trying to save us,

138
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,507
and we haven't seen
any sign of him since.

139
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,545
I'll come after you all later.
I promise I will.

140
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,515
I'm a Pumpkin Pirate after all.

141
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,351
But he did live
in the world outside here.

142
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,119
That's what Henzo said, yeah!

143
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,721
He's been living in
Luluka this whole time

144
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,056
looking for a way to bring
us back from the mist.

145
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,025
What's more, he says
that 50 years have passed

146
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,026
since we came here.

147
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,396
[IAN] Hmph! Fifty years?
Oh. Don't be so stupid.

148
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,064
Have you ever thought
that maybe the old man's

149
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,966
just playing a
little trick on you?

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,002
Why would he do
something like that?

151
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,638
How should I know
the reason behind it?

152
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,674
But if what the old man
Henzo told us really is true,

153
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,710
I wonder what's happened
to the town of Luluka.

154
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,648
[RONGO]
Mom. Dad.

155
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,250
Anyway, there's no
point worrying about it.

156
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,752
You'll just figure out
whether it's true or not

157
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,587
once we all make it out of here.

158
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,056
[AKIBI]
You know a way to get back?

159
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,691
Of course I do!

160
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,327
I am the best raiding captain
of the Wetton Pirates,

161
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,329
after all,
and don't you forget it.

162
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,530
Wow! Ian, really?

163
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,332
You can take us back to Luluka?

164
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,400
Sure thing.

165
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,036
Just give me
the keys to this cell.

166
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,038
All you have to do
is let me out of here,

167
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,206
and I'll take
charge of you kids

168
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,241
and make sure that
you get back home.

00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,052
Saying he knows how to
get out of the Rainbow Mist

174
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,687
is just a way of tricking you.

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,754
He's a liar.

176
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,390
Huh? It was a lie?

177
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,592
[laughs]

178
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,360
Isoka, you're a tough one.

179
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,761
I won't trust you again.

180
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,265
I haven't forgotten how
badly you treated us all.

181
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,536
[IAN] Listen up,
you pathetic weaklings!

182
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:27,073
Being on the sea means being
an inch away from danger!

183
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,474
So listen to me!

184
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,610
In order to survive
you must follow the orders

185
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,046
of the Wetton Pirate's
raiding captain, Ian!

186
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,549
I can't believe it!

187
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,051
That ship over there is
all full of treasure, too!

188
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,088
Right! Take all of it
to the captain's quarters.

189
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,789
We also found some food!

190
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,891
[IAN]
Okay.

191
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,093
Well then that can go to the
captain's quarters, too.

192
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,262
It's a sea serpent.
He's gonna eat us!

193
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,430
[screams]

194
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,501
Help me!

195
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,672
‐‐Help!
‐‐Don't run away. Go fight it!

196
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,775
No! Rongo!

197
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,244
[ISOKA]
Rapa Nui!

198
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,786
[RAPA NUI]
Monster!

199
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,490
Take this!

200
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,370
Don't look at me like that!

201
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,640
Looking at those pouty faces
of yours is ruining my appetite!

202
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,841
Just remember this.

203
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,678
The only reason you've stayed
alive this long is because

204
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,881
I'm on board to help you
sorry excuses for pirates.

205
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,449
And I haven't
even gotten a "thanks."

206
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,383
The least you could do

207
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,352
is wipe those expressions
off your faces.

208
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:51,190
[rumbling]

209
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,792
Great, what now?

210
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,798
[screams]

211
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,300
[RAPA NUI] He must have been
drawn here by the smell of food!

212
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:01,801
Guys!

213
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,202
Get outside now!

214
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,638
Wait! This is my ship!

215
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,873
I order you to stay
here and defend it, you...

216
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,542
Your precious ship is
more important to you

217
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,310
than any of our lives, is it?

218
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,282
We don't have any use for
a leader who thinks like that!

219
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,534
[IAN]
Damn it, that was my ship!

220
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,803
I think we're better off
without that ship, anyway.

221
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,805
Our adventure is
just getting started.

222
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,240
Are you ready?

223
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,541
[CREW]
Mm.

224
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,912
You're always running
that fat mouth of yours,

225
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,382
and you never think
about anyone but yourself.

226
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,950
We're sick of dealing with you!

227
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,953
You can hate me all you want,
but that doesn't mean I'm lying.

228
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,755
What if I really do
know a way out of here,

229
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,989
and you decide not to listen?

230
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,724
I'll never trust you.

231
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,792
[IAN]
Go ahead and try me.

232
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,261
See if I'm lying.

233
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,329
Aren't you at least
a little concerned

234
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,665
about what happened to Luluka?

235
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,932
Just think about it.

236
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,568
All we have to do is take the
treasure out of Ape's Concert,

237
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,637
and we won't have
to lift a finger again,

238
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,472
for as long as we live.

239
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,607
We don't have to stay here,

240
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,575
living as stranded
pirates in the mist.

241
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,943
Well, what do you say?

242
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,413
Come with me and
go back to the outside world.

243
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,582
Rapa Nui is the only leader
that we have or that we want.

244
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,752
We will never follow you
as long as we live!

245
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,422
I can see you're a tough
one to win over Isoka.

246
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,956
Well, just think
it through okay?

247
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,491
Take as much time as you need.

248
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,295
[alarm sounds]

249
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,630
Hey. What's wrong?

250
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,764
[RAPA NUI]
A ship!

251
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,933
Everyone prepare
for a battle, right now!

252
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,702
Fortify our defenses.

253
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,703
I wonder,

254
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,972
how were they able to
figure out where we are?

255
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,708
Ah!

256
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,310
Is that?

257
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,945
Pukau!

258
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,782
Oh! Wow!

259
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,685
That ship's so cool.

260
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,720
It's a wrecked warship,

261
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,954
isn't that right?

262
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,291
Yes, but right now it's what
we're using as our main hideout.

263
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,626
[RAPA NUI]
Cowards!

264
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,695
Just let Pukau go!

265
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,331
[LUFFY]
What is he talking about?

266
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,466
Shut up!

267
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,070
Let him go now!

268
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,286
[SOLDIER A]
Mayor! It's the Talielisin!

269
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:39,358
[WETTON] Oh! My dear
old ship has returned at last!

270
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,926
But Grandpa, I don't understand.

271
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,529
Why is the ship returning
after all this time away?

272
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,365
Hey! I told you to
call me Mayor, didn't I?

273
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:46,899
Yeah.

274
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,268
Look over there.

275
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,604
Fifty years ago,
my dear ship disappeared

276
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,539
into the Rainbow Mist.

277
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,307
And now that
the ship has returned,

278
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,209
it means that the
doorway to Ape's Concert

279
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,545
has been opened again at last.

280
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,947
So basically, it's now or
never if we want to find a way

281
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,583
to get the treasure from
inside Ape's Concert, huh?

282
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,551
Yes, that's right.

283
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,987
Wait! How do you know
about the treasure?

284
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,922
Your grandson
here told me about it.

285
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,590
He was quite helpful, really.

286
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,259
Lake! You idiot.

287
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,059
After everything that I said

288
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,295
about the treasure
being a secret!

289
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,897
I'm so sorry, Grandpa.

290
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,565
I mean... Mayor, sir.

291
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,768
It must try one's patience,
having such a dimwitted family.

292
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,470
[SANJI, CHOPPER]
Mm‐hmm. Mm‐hmm.

293
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,604
[WETTON]
You have no idea.

294
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,941
Hey! Acting sympathetic
toward me won't help you any!

295
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,576
However you found out about it,

296
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,578
now that you know the
secret of Ape's Concert,

297
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,680
I cannot afford
to let you leave.

298
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,317
You intend to
silence us, is that it?

299
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,420
No, but you're going to pay
an "I found a secret" tax.

300
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,490
No less than ten million
Berries for each of you.

301
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:45,591
Haha.

302
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,359
You're kidding me!

303
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,528
That's way too much!

304
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,764
More to the point,
what kinda tax is that?

305
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,466
Are you saying you
won't be able to pay?

306
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,335
Tax collectors!

307
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,977
[FLIP]
You called for me, Mayor Wetton?

308
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,612
[LAKE]
Oh, Daddy!

309
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,514
Daddy?

310
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,483
Take these three to the Rainbow
Tower and put them to work!

311
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,952
Doing some really hard labor.

312
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,720
What's a rainbow tower?

313
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,056
[WETTON]
That is the Rainbow Tower.

314
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,491
You will work off
your debt at that tower

315
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,360
for the rest of your life.

316
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,630
It will be heavy, hellish
labor from morning till night.

317
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,634
But don't worry,
I doubt you'll live long.

318
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:29,835
Get going, Phillip.

319
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,704
Take them away to the tower.

320
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,740
Ho ho! It looks as if the
Rainbow Mist has appeared again,

321
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,808
hasn't it, Father?

322
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,809
Now is our chance!

323
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,410
We can finally retrieve
all of our treasure

324
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,346
from inside Ape's Concert!

325
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,715
He just gave it all
away again.

326
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,984
Secrets sure don't
mean much to them.

327
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:45,851
What a shame.

328
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,653
They're three
generations of idiots.

329
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,487
You idiot!

330
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,321
All right fine!

331
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,990
Let's just go ahead
and call Henzo

332
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,992
and get him
investigating the mist.

333
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:53,893
Yes, sir.

334
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,761
Get me a transponder
snail right away.

335
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,896
Move now!

336
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,833
Just calm down a sec, will you?

337
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:01,400
Quiet!

338
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,601
You took Pukau hostage

339
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,037
and forced him to tell you
where our base was, didn't you?

340
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,039
I'll make you pay!

341
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,008
That's not very nice now is it.

342
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,680
[PUKAU] Rapa Nui,
I'm not really a hostage!

343
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,849
They just asked me to lead
them here, so I brought them.

344
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,050
That's all it was, really.

345
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,553
[RAPA NUI] No, they threatened
you to make you say that!

346
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,422
It's true! These are
not bad people.

347
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm being serious!

348
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,392
Look he's not mad.

349
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,428
Even when I do this.

350
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,696
It's a lie!

351
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,965
This is a strategy to get us to
let our guards down, that's all.

352
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,767
[ROBIN]
You misunderstand.

353
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,035
We only wanted
to find you to ask

354
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,371
if there is a way to get out of
Ape's Concert, nothing more.

355
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,106
Once you find out?

356
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,042
Then that's when you're
going to steal all the treasure

357
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:43,976
from the shipwrecks.

358
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,611
I know what you're doing here.

359
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,446
No, Rapa Nui, that's not it.

360
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,949
I know these people,
and they would not do that.

361
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,618
How can I believe anything
that a grown‐up says?

362
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,987
Of course the treasure's
what they're after!

363
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,655
This isn't going anywhere.

364
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,657
[USOPP]
Hey!

365
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,894
Look! Usopp's very special
lunch is now ready for eating!

366
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,762
[LUFFY]
Wahoo! Lunch time!

367
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,431
Would you guys like some too?

368
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,067
[PUKAU]
Oh yeah!

369
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,436
I can't promise
if it's gonna taste good.

370
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,071
Don't listen to him.
He's stupid.

371
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,472
Wow, this is delicious!

372
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,940
Did you make all
this by yourself?

373
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,608
Yep! There's nothing I can't do.

374
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,910
Hey, Luffy, slow down!

375
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,078
Those aren't all for you.

376
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,581
They aren't as good as Sanji's,
but they're still yummy.

377
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,582
There are some
children over there

378
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,918
who look like they might
want some food too.

379
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,154
You guys! Come down too!

380
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,756
These are amazing!

381
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,790
Oh? Really?

382
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,092
Oh yeah!

383
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,094
Don't take it!

384
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,695
They're tricking you!

385
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,663
Hey, what ever happened

386
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,599
to the pride of the
Pumpkin Pirates, huh?

387
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,035
[HENZO]
Rapa Nui!

388
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,504
Pride's not going
to fill their stomachs.

389
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,609
[ISOKA] What? You guys really
came from the East Blue?

390
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,577
Seriously?

391
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,344
[ZORO]
Yeah.

392
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,412
Sure did.

393
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,279
[AKIBI]
Which means you must have

394
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,615
gone past Reverse
Mountain on the way?

395
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,151
[RONGO]
You guys must be real brave!

396
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,319
Oh yeah!
You better believe it!

397
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,688
We've had more adventures
than you can possibly count.

398
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,991
We've fought giants and goldfish
that swallow whole islands.

399
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,128
And we saved a country from
a secret crime organization.

400
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,529
Wow! Really?

401
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:11,597
How cool!

402
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,332
And, the only reason
we were able to come out of

403
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,034
all of those death
defying situations

404
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,436
with our lives was
my bravery and wisdom!

405
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,004
And because of
these great attributes,

406
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,441
I am known as Captain Usopp!

407
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,110
What's that for?

408
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,111
We're trying to eat here.

409
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,679
Say it don't spray it.

410
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,056
[HENZO]
Rapa Nui.

411
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,724
Please forgive me!

412
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,026
I'm so ashamed of myself!

413
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,395
I've spent the last 50 years
of my life doing research,

414
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:47,466
trying to find a way to get you
all out of the Rainbow Mist.

415
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,635
And I've finally found
a way to get back inside,

416
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,072
but because of my carelessness,
we can't get out!

417
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,641
I'm a failure as
a pirate professor!

418
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,577
I'm ashamed,
but I must ask you, please,

419
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,746
if you know a way out, tell me!

420
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,348
We must find
a way back to Luluka!

421
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:08,487
Then once we're out of here,
we can return home together.

422
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,490
No. There's no way
to get out of here.

423
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,227
And even if there was, I still
wouldn't tell any of you.

424
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,162
I don't trust any of you at all.

425
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,099
It's not like you've
given me a real reason to.

426
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,235
[USOPP sighs]
And you call yourselves friends?

427
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,670
What's that?

428
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,538
You can forget about
the rest of us for a second,

429
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,607
but the professor here
is your friend, right?

430
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,075
I mean, if you can't
trust your friends,

431
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,511
then who can you trust, exactly?

432
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,546
You can just stay out of this.

433
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,449
You really expect me to
believe this ridiculous story?

434
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,751
That 50 years
have suddenly gone by.

435
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,121
Yes, I do.

436
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,189
Because, it doesn't matter
how different he looks

437
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,724
or how much time has passed.

438
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,593
He once marched
under the same flag as you,

439
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,229
so he's still one of
your friends, ya got that?

440
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,763
While the color of
the flag may fade,

441
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,366
true friendship
is forever, you know?

442
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,204
[SNAIL]
Puru‐puru‐puru‐puru.

443
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,373
Oh, wait, that's me.

444
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,074
Yes, yes.

445
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,475
I'm coming.

446
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,743
Hey.

447
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,245
Yep? Hi, hello?

448
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,213
What good does it
do for you to answer?

449
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,382
[FLIP]
Well, well, Professor Henzo.

450
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,751
Huh? Who is this anyway?

451
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,221
What? Wait a second,
who are you?

452
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,122
Hey, Luffy.

453
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,724
Where the heck'd you go?

454
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,226
You guys just went
and ran off with the ship!

455
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,127
You put the rest of us

456
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,663
in a kinda sticky
situation, you know?

457
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,331
Huh? It's Nami.

458
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,667
So you're connected
to Nami and the others?

459
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,401
Nami?

460
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,469
Hold on.

461
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,804
If we can talk to her,
then that must mean that...

462
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,640
Is this the outside world?

463
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,309
Phillip? Phillip,
respond are you there?

464
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,278
Yes, Phillip here.

465
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,580
Professor Henzo,
what's your location now?

466
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,482
[HENZO] I'm currently
inside the Rainbow Mist.

467
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,149
Huh?

468
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,084
Really?

469
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,352
Rainbow Mist?

470
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,487
Inside?

471
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,356
At the moment, I'm afraid
we're unable to escape it.

472
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,193
Do you think, perhaps,
you could come rescue us?

473
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,594
You mean someone's coming?

474
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,362
[RONGO]
We can go back to Luluka now?

475
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,597
Really? Wow!

476
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,265
Yeah, isn't that great?

477
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,800
[HENZO]
We don't have any time to waste!

478
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,469
Someone needs to equip the
safety search gear I invented

479
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:07,139
and come get us from inside
the mist and tell Wetton

480
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,509
that he'll also need to
double check all of the‐‐

481
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,877
What are you doing?

482
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,645
That name you just said‐‐Wetton!

483
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,380
He's the exact same man
who was responsible

484
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,548
for burning down Luluka.

485
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,184
Isn't that right, Henzo?

486
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,886
I had to team up with that man!

487
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,554
It was the only way
I could figure out

488
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,889
how to save all of you.

489
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,557
It's all clear to me now.

490
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,526
You aren't the Henzo
that we knew, after all.

491
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,527
Admit it.

492
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,163
If you were a true
Pumpkin Pirate as you say,

493
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,898
then you never would have
become one of Wetton's pawns

494
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,233
in a million years.

495
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,300
Never!

496
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,169
Rapa Nui.

497
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,671
Don't you dare say my name.

498
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,573
You lousy traitor.

499
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,743
Uh, hello? Hello?

500
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,712
Well, well, so those
guys really did end up

501
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,647
in that weird mist after all.

502
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,748
What do we do?

503
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,316
Isn't it obvious?

504
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,318
We go inside the mist.

505
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,254
Just a minute!

506
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,156
I told you.

507
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,758
You're not allowed
to go into Ape's Concert

508
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,727
without obtaining my permission.

509
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,263
Disobey me and you'll regret it.

510
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,398
Hey, there.

511
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,900
Where's this safety gear the
professor was talking about?

512
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,168
Here it is.

513
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,204
Thank you.

514
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,438
What did you do that for?

515
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,573
[SANJI, NAMI, CHOPPER]
Thanks a lot.

516
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,507
Move now!

517
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,576
I want you to seize
them immediately!

518
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,177
Yes, sir!

519
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,345
Come on, men. Let's go.

520
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,546
And here I was
hoping they'd let us

521
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,583
run peacefully off
into the sunset.

522
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:32,858
[CHOPPER]
Get going, Nami!

523
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:33,692
Sure thing.

524
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,559
Leave Luffy
and the others to me.

525
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,362
I'll take care of it
and the treasure.

526
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,204
Nami!

527
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,243
[NAMI screams]

528
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,644
[CHOPPER]
Uh‐oh.

529
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,920
<i>♪Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

530
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,624
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear‐blue sky...</i>

531
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,394
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

532
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:16,468
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

533
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,918
<i>When I am alone</i>

534
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:38,790
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

535
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,426
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

536
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:46,031
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

537
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:51,036
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

538
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,605
<i>until I recalled...</i>

539
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

540
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,980
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

541
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:07,719
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...♪</i>

542
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,026
[NAMI]
Hey! You guys!

543
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,862
[ZORO]
Oh, Nami, it's just you.

544
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,797
[NAMI] What do you mean,
"it's just you"?

545
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,466
And after I came
all this way to save you!

546
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,701
Uh, where's Luffy?

547
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,636
[ZORO]
Well, he's not here.

548
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,804
[NAMI]
Huh?

549
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,305
[USOPP] He's disappeared
somewhere off beyond the mist.

550
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,540
[NAMI]
What do you mean by that?

551
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,908
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

552
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,676
"An Inevitable Melee!

553
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,979
Wetton's Schemes
and the Rainbow Tower."

554
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,548
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
