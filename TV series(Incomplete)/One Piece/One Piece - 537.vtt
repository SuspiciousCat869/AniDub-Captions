WEBVTT

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.171
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.174
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.723
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.326
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.691
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.594
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:45.632
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.935
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.538
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.705
they held.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.541
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.943
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.145
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.682
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:05.952
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.589
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:13.126
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.599
[NARRATOR] Two years have passed
since the War of the Best

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:20.934
in Marineford.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.871
Luffy and his crew reunite to
continue on to the New World.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.740
The first stop on their journey
is Fishman Island,

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:31.511
which resides thousands
of feet below sea level.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.580
Now, they're separated
once again,

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:37.383
stirring up trouble all
over the ocean floor.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.354
[HORDY] And now we
will restore his dream.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.290
The New Fishman Pirates
continue his legacy!

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.126
Shark Grip!

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:53.833
[PAPPAGU]
Okay, I am so not into this!

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.201
I'll check you all later!

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.541
Camie. I need a favor from you.

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:02.809
[CAMIE]
Huh?

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:05.111
C'mon, Zoro! Let's move!

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.449
Listen up.

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.318
Do me a favor and help
those two get out of here.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.953
[NEPTUNE]
And what about you?

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.855
[ZORO] We're not gonna
make it out of here.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.490
Not if that guy's chasing us.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.599
This is a revolution,
and you're in the way.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.871
Um... I, uh...
Well, um... Y'see...

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:35.208
Uh, good job, you found me!

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:38.177
She's huge! Oh, no. Is she...

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.079
Ah, jeez.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.816
[FISHMEN] The Pirates!
They kidnapped the princess!

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.252
No, it's nothing!

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.955
No matter what you hear,
please don't turn around!

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.024
Huh? Why?
What's the big deal?

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:54.394
Don't do it!
I don't want you to die, Sanji!

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.900
[LUFFY]
"Keep Shirahoshi Safe!

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.535
Decken Close Behind!"

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:10.109
[DECKEN] Ba ho ho ho! Ba ho ho
ho! Ba ho ho ho!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.911
I'm coming, my love!

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.415
Wherever you are, I'll find you!

00:05:15.448 --> 00:05:19.552
It's either death
or marriage for you!

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:24.324
[DECKEN] Ba ho ho ho!
Ba ho ho ho! Ba ho ho ho!

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.099
[FISHMEN gasping, chattering]

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.273
[FISHMAN A]
That's... That's...

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.709
...Princess Shirahoshi!

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.945
They... They really did it!

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.113
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.015
[FISHMAN A]
They kidnapped the princess!

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.085
Hey! What the hell?

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.087
Why'd ya get outta
the shark, ya big baby?

00:05:57.657 --> 00:05:59.726
I'm ever so sorry, Luffy!

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.396
Please don't get mad at me.
I promise, it wasn't my fault!

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.332
[crying]

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:09.302
[FISHMAN A]
That monster made her cry!

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:10.937
He's pure evil!

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.505
[FISHMAN B]
Oh, how could he?

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.407
Poor Princess Shirahoshi!

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.176
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.781
--Wait.
--[CHOPPER gasps]

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.220
Did he just say... Princess?

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.421
[CHOPPER]
Please, don't!

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:29.956
No, Sanji!

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.259
Fight the urge to look!

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.527
Hey.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.930
I need to know; if I turn around
to look behind me...

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.935
...am I gonna see
the Mermaid Princess?

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.003
[CHOPPER]
I won't lie.

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.506
She's behind you and
that's exactly why you can't

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.074
turn around!

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:51.110
The sight of an average
Mermaid almost killed you!

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.678
[crying]

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.782
If you see the Mermaid Princess,

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.850
every last drop
of blood in your body

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:00.620
will spray out your nose
like a geyser!

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.755
And then you'll be dead!

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.763
[SANJI]
The Mermaid Princess.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.398
They say even Boa Hancock,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.233
the most beautiful
woman in the world,

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.936
pales in comparison.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.739
She's the most gorgeous
Mermaid who ever lived,

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:23.009
and now she's right behind me.

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:25.278
[CHOPPER]
No, Sanji! I'm begging you!

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.047
Don't turn around!

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.450
[crying]

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.321
[SANJI]
Chopper.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.956
It's true.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.425
I could give up on my
dreams and die a coward

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.060
at a ripe old age.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:44.797
But I'd rather
reach for the stars...

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.468
...and die right now!

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.502
[CHOPPER]
What?!

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:51.270
But you always told me
your dream was to find

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.872
the All Blue!

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:01.681
[CHOPPER]
No!

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.785
Sanji!

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:14.827
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.062
Th...

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.866
That's her.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:24.971
I never realized how
meager my imagination is.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:27.907
She's magnificent!

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.244
She is quite simply...

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:36.182
...too beautiful for the
mind to comprehend!

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.386
He turned to stone!

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.321
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.090
Princess Shirahoshi!

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:46.158
We've gotta rescue her somehow!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:47.193
Are you crazy?

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:48.761
These are the same pirates
that overpowered

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.429
the entire royal family!

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:54.000
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:59.372
I expected death
by arterial nasal spray.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:02.842
But this is new.
How do I even treat this?

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:04.076
Wait a sec.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.513
I wonder if his blood donors
have something to do with this.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.083
Help...
Luffy, what should I do?

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.219
[crying]

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:18.157
Hey! What happened, huh?

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.625
Talk to me, Hachi!

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.061
Just tell me what creeps
did this to you!

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:30.202
[HACHI grunts]

00:09:33.806 --> 00:09:35.608
What the hell're
you morons doing?

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.144
[FISHMAN C]
We caught them!

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:39.345
[FISHMAN D]
We actually did it!

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.347
We got the Straw Hats!

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.315
Of course!

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:44.150
Guys like us hunt
Sea Kings for a living,

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.719
so what are a couple of
wussy pirates gonna do?

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.721
Those punks are outta
their league down here!

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.556
That's what ya get for
messin' with sea hunters,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.524
you jerks!

00:09:51.557 --> 00:09:53.659
And here I thought the
army was our only hope!

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:54.760
Huzzah!

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.162
You guys are fishermen!

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.264
You realize we're
not fish, don't you?

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.399
Hey, I remember this lowlife!

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.367
That's right!

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.569
You used to be one
of Arlong's goons, huh?

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.440
You're safe now,
Princess, we saved you!

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:09.575
[FISHMAN E] I say we turn 'em
over to the Ammo Knights

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.911
so they can cut their heads off!

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.413
Uh, wait,
it's not what you think!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.782
Please! Luffy's not a bad guy!

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.452
Hey, what is that?

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.921
There's somethin'
flyin' at us! Look!

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:22.922
[FISHMEN]
Huh?

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.123
Really?

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.458
You think we're dumb enough
to fall for the oldest trick

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:26.626
in the damn book?

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:27.893
[FISHMEN]
Huh?

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.061
What the--?

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.863
There really is
something up there!

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.434
It looks like coral.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.404
Yeah. But there's someone on it.

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.640
[FISHMAN K]
Oh, no. Not good!

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:42.541
It's Vander Decken!

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.479
[DECKEN]
I found you, Princess!

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:49.982
I suspect! Ba ho ho ho!

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.584
C'mere, sweetie!

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:56.022
Oh, no. Please, not now.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:59.058
[FISHMAN F] I bet he was in
cahoots with these pirates!

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.027
He's turned on his own people!

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.062
[FISHMAN G] Run, Princess!
We'll handle this!

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.363
Just get out of here!

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:07.333
[DECKEN] Ha! It's time for
an answer, Shirahoshi!

00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:09.535
It's either "yes" or death!

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:16.809
[DECKEN] Ba ha ha ha!
If you truly wish to live...

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.779
[fanfare plays]

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:23.716
...then you'll marry me!

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.053
Wait, are you serious?

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:28.654
You've been throwing
weapons at the castle,

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.756
trying to kill her for
ten whole years now,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.325
and you actually think
she's gonna marry you?

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.327
You're really twisted,
Vander Decken!

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.696
You make me sick!

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.531
The Princess has been
forced to live locked up

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.766
inside a tower for a
whole decade thanks to

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.735
your sick sense of romance!

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.770
Now you propose? Monster!

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.372
Now, let's hear it!

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:49.542
Although, I do suspect
that it's a yes!

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:52.211
Ba ho ho ho ho!

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.246
[laughter continues]

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:03.856
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Uh...

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.559
[DECKEN]
Say it! Say yes!

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:07.727
Ba ho ho ho ho!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.729
Ye...

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:11.697
You're just not my type!

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:22.374
[DECKEN]
What?!

00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:29.348
No!

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.317
[FISHMEN]
Huh?!

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.954
That's your only reason?!

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:38.357
[DECKEN grunting]

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.762
Ye... You... Ye... You...

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:44.396
You tramp!

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.932
Then who is your type, huh?!

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:50.402
After you've led me on
for ten whole years!

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.938
If you refuse to love me,

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.474
I refuse to let you exist!

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:58.077
Drop dead, my darling!

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.346
Run, Princess Shirahoshi, run!

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:01.213
[FISHMAN H]
Hurry!

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.349
We'll fend him off
with our lives!

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:05.718
Don't you move, you big baby!

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.453
And don't cry!

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.321
Haven't you caused
enough trouble?

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.490
Stop telling her what
to do, ya jerks!

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:13.926
You're one of Vander
Decken's lackeys, aren't you?

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.395
You probably want
the princess to die!

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.631
Look, I can't protect
you if you run away!

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.101
Okay! I'll stay!

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:23.202
No, Princess!

00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:25.070
[DECKEN yells]

00:13:25.104 --> 00:13:27.173
[FISHMAN N]
Leave her alone, you scumbag!

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:29.375
[FISHMAN O]
You make me sick, pirate!

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.143
Real sorry 'bout this, guys.

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:33.712
It's nothin' personal,
but you're...

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.080
...in my way!

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.088
Second Gear!

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:46.525
Luffy!

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.027
[DECKEN]
Huh... Huh?!

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.462
[DECKEN yells]

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:55.835
He did that with
his hands tied up?

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:58.304
[DECKEN] Quit sticking your
butt into my business!

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.272
This is between us!

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.541
You're the one who kidnapped
her from the tower,

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:03.843
aren't you?

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:07.112
[grunting]

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.581
Listen, you jerk!

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.917
I'm gonna make sure
you never throw anything

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.486
at anyone ever again!

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.655
You better hope
you can back that up,

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:19.558
or I'm gonna throw you
both into a shallow grave!

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:22.161
[LUFFY]
Let's see you try!

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.065
You let me go! Now!

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:28.968
All right, now Gum-Gum...

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:29.869
...Jet...

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.003
[DECKEN yells]

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:37.743
...Hammer!

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:12.544
[FISHMAN Q]
Wait... He just...

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.547
He just beat Vander Decken!

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:20.419
[DECKEN grunting]]

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.355
It looks like he's still alive.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:24.823
But now we can catch him!

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.794
[LUFFY grunting]

00:15:30.523 --> 00:15:32.424
[LUFFY]
Shark! Pull it together!

00:15:33.092 --> 00:15:34.493
[SANJI grunts]

00:15:34.527 --> 00:15:35.661
Hey, Sanji!

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:38.230
You okay?

00:15:38.264 --> 00:15:40.599
[CHOPPER] Well, he turned to
stone a few minutes back,

00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:43.502
but he's all smiles now,
and he's conscious.

00:15:43.536 --> 00:15:45.137
Okay, that's good to hear.

00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:48.741
[SANJI]
The Mermaid Princess.

00:15:48.774 --> 00:15:52.144
I-I must have died
and gone to heaven.

00:15:52.177 --> 00:15:53.746
My dream came true!

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:55.848
My life is complete!

00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:57.082
Once again,

00:15:57.116 --> 00:15:59.852
I'm pretty sure your actual
dream was to find the All Blue.

00:15:59.885 --> 00:16:02.388
[SHIRAHOSHI whimoering]

00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:05.124
Hey! Hurry it up!

00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:06.992
Sorry!

00:16:07.026 --> 00:16:08.594
But please stop yelling.
It makes it hard

00:16:08.627 --> 00:16:10.796
for me to concentrate
when you do.

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:12.364
My heart's racing!

00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:13.532
I don't get it.

00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.068
These people don't like
us for some reason.

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:17.970
We gotta hurry
and get outta here!

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:23.609
Thanks a lot!
Good job! Let's go!

00:16:23.642 --> 00:16:24.843
Uh, okay!

00:16:26.712 --> 00:16:28.581
What are you doing, Princess?

00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:30.115
Why did you untie him?

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:31.817
That evil pirate did this!

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.986
He scared her so much
she's brainwashed now!

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:35.921
Sorry for all the trouble!

00:16:35.955 --> 00:16:38.591
I'll be back home in time
for dinner, I promise!

00:16:38.624 --> 00:16:39.592
[FISHMEN]
Huh?

00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.927
[LUFFY]
Okay, Shark! Get movin'!

00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:43.462
[MEGALO grunts]

00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:50.469
[DECKEN grunts]

00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:51.870
[FISHMEN yell]

00:16:51.904 --> 00:16:53.639
Get back, you peasants!

00:16:53.672 --> 00:16:56.809
[chuckling]

00:16:56.842 --> 00:16:58.877
Stop them now!

00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:01.246
Wadatsumi!

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:09.688
[WADATSUMI yelling]

00:17:15.694 --> 00:17:17.563
Oh, hey,
I think I know that dude.

00:17:17.596 --> 00:17:19.898
That's the Sea Bonze
who attacked the Sunny!

00:17:19.932 --> 00:17:21.467
He works for Decken!

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.369
Oh, no, it's the Great Monk!

00:17:23.402 --> 00:17:24.603
Oh, crap!

00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:27.473
Swat them down
like the insects they are!

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:31.543
You got it, boss!

00:17:31.577 --> 00:17:33.145
Now... Second Gear!

00:17:36.415 --> 00:17:39.451
[WADATSUMI yelling]

00:17:39.485 --> 00:17:41.553
And Gum-Gum...

00:17:41.587 --> 00:17:44.223
[yelling continues]

00:17:44.256 --> 00:17:45.991
...Jet...

00:17:46.025 --> 00:17:47.359
...Pistol!

00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:51.463
[WADATSUMI yelling]

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.771
[WADATSUMI]
My tooth! He broke it!

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.344
[WADATSUMI crying]

00:18:06.812 --> 00:18:08.514
Damn worthless giant.

00:18:10.482 --> 00:18:11.483
Okay.

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:14.253
Let's get a move on!

00:18:14.286 --> 00:18:15.521
To the Sea Forest!

00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:16.722
Yeah!

00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:22.494
[PIRATE A]
Hey. Hey, Boss!

00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:25.064
That pirate girl and her
Mermaid friend just escaped

00:18:25.097 --> 00:18:27.433
the Ryugu Palace!

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:28.701
[HORDY]
Who gives a damn?

00:18:30.903 --> 00:18:33.105
Once I get rid
of this annoyance,

00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:35.407
I'll only have to deal
with a feeble old fool

00:18:35.441 --> 00:18:37.643
and his helpless mob.

00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:40.312
[chuckling]

00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:41.680
Shark Arrows!

00:18:49.722 --> 00:18:50.689
Namichin.

00:18:50.723 --> 00:18:53.525
Should we have left the
others behind like that?

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:56.295
If anyone else tried to come,
we would've been caught.

00:18:56.328 --> 00:18:58.197
Seemed like they
were in trouble, though.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.798
Those guys are fine.

00:18:59.832 --> 00:19:03.469
Don't worry, they always make
it out alive somehow.

00:19:03.502 --> 00:19:06.338
[CAMIE] Yeah. I mean,
I know they're tough and all.

00:19:08.741 --> 00:19:11.410
But there's something
scary about Hordy.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:14.079
Hatchin said he's strong,
but more than that,

00:19:14.113 --> 00:19:16.014
he's cruel and ruthless.

00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:18.884
[NAMI]
They can handle it.

00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:20.619
They've grown stronger
by leaps and bounds

00:19:20.652 --> 00:19:22.154
these past two years.

00:19:22.187 --> 00:19:23.355
That aside...

00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:26.358
Can you tell me what this former
Warlord, Jimbei, is like?

00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:29.194
Huh? Oh. Well...

00:19:29.228 --> 00:19:30.562
It's true he's a pirate.

00:19:30.596 --> 00:19:32.898
But he's well trusted on the
island and they respect him

00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:35.400
enough that he can
visit the palace, too.

00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:37.269
Really? That's interesting.

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:40.105
Especially since he was
a part of Arlong's crew,

00:19:40.139 --> 00:19:42.407
and now this Hordy guy
is presenting himself

00:19:42.441 --> 00:19:45.210
like the second
coming of Arlong.

00:19:45.244 --> 00:19:49.948
And, Jimbei made a point
to warn Luffy not to fight him.

00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:52.151
And now I'm pretty sure
I know why that is.

00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:53.051
Huh?

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.653
He was trying to keep
him safe, right?

00:19:54.686 --> 00:19:56.755
Just in case,
let's keep our fingers crossed

00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:59.758
that Zoro and the others
don't push Hordy too far.

00:19:59.792 --> 00:20:01.760
No matter what, though...

00:20:01.794 --> 00:20:03.862
I wanna meet this Jimbei guy.

00:20:03.896 --> 00:20:06.498
He's waiting for Luffy
at the Sea Forest now, right?

00:20:06.532 --> 00:20:08.934
We're a part of this,
whether we like it or not.

00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:10.569
The whole kingdom could topple,

00:20:10.602 --> 00:20:12.304
but I don't know anything
about the history

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.239
behind Hordy and
his pirate crew.

00:20:14.273 --> 00:20:17.009
I bet Jimbei could help us
decide how to handle this.

00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:18.710
Wait, do you really think so?

00:20:18.744 --> 00:20:19.745
Camie.

00:20:21.613 --> 00:20:24.216
I need to get to the Sea Forest!

00:20:24.249 --> 00:20:25.250
Right!

00:20:36.461 --> 00:20:38.330
[NEPTUNE]
Listen up, soldiers!

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:39.565
Sir!

00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:41.166
We swear, we'll take care of
Hordy and the rest of his crew

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.100
immediately!

00:20:42.134 --> 00:20:43.268
[NEPTUNE]
No, you won't!

00:20:43.302 --> 00:20:44.436
[FISHMEN SOLDIERS]
Huh?

00:20:44.469 --> 00:20:46.905
[NEPTUNE] I'm too weak to
give you my full assistance,

00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:49.875
and I can't let you sacrifice
your lives like that.

00:20:49.908 --> 00:20:52.444
We shall surrender the
palace for the time being

00:20:52.477 --> 00:20:54.546
and meet up with Fukaboshi.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.149
We will fight back
when the time is right!

00:20:57.182 --> 00:20:58.150
[FISHMEN SOLDIERS gasp]

00:20:58.183 --> 00:20:59.518
You can't mean that, sir!

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.221
We can't let the palace
fall to this evil scum!

00:21:02.254 --> 00:21:03.989
Damn it, Zoro,
I know you're strong,

00:21:04.022 --> 00:21:05.924
but do you really think
you can beat a Fishman

00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:06.859
in the water?

00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.126
I'm so weak.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.127
Usopp.

00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:11.230
I know these old bones
aren't the priority,

00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:13.899
but I fear
I may soon drown.

00:21:13.932 --> 00:21:16.235
How're you gonna drown
when you don't have lungs?

00:21:18.303 --> 00:21:19.304
Good point.

00:21:19.338 --> 00:21:20.539
[whining]

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.350
[HORDY] You're getting
weaker, I can feel it.

00:21:31.383 --> 00:21:34.887
You can't hold out
for long, puny human.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.123
[laughing]

00:21:38.156 --> 00:21:41.360
[USOPP]
Zoro's gonna pass out soon.

00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.928
That must be Hordy's plan!

00:21:50.135 --> 00:21:51.536
[ZORO]
There's no time!

00:21:54.973 --> 00:21:56.174
Zoro!

00:22:08.153 --> 00:22:10.355
That swordsman's
as good as dead!

00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:12.658
Yeah, well, the moron
challenged a fishman

00:22:12.691 --> 00:22:14.726
in the water, so there's
really only one way

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.061
that fight can end!

00:22:16.094 --> 00:22:18.130
You're pretty resilient,
aren't you?

00:22:18.163 --> 00:22:20.198
But now it's time to die.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.869
Your era's at an end!

00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:26.004
You miserable,
worthless primate!

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.348
Zoro!

00:22:47.326 --> 00:22:48.727
Zoro, no!

00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:55.367
Captain, no!

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.338
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style... Lion Strike!

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:16.955
[NARRATOR] Zoro and companions
try to escape Ryugu Palace.

00:23:16.989 --> 00:23:18.690
However, the new
Fishman Pirates,

00:23:18.724 --> 00:23:20.492
powered by energy steroids,

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:22.594
drive them into a
corner once more.

00:23:22.627 --> 00:23:25.897
Meanwhile, Jimbei reunites
with Luffy in the sea forest,

00:23:25.931 --> 00:23:28.433
and while Shirahoshi visits
her mother's grave,

00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:30.102
he reveals his
shocking connection

00:23:30.135 --> 00:23:32.070
to the Fishman Arlong.

00:23:32.104 --> 00:23:33.772
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.805 --> 00:23:35.807
"The Straw Hats Defeated?!

00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:38.643
Hordy Gains Control
of the Ryugu Palace!"

00:23:38.677 --> 00:23:41.113
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
