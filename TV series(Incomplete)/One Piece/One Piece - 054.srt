Sounds like lunch to me.

[NAMI]
Here goes.

45
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,262
Ha! We got a good wind, huh?

46
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,663
We did it!

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,700
[ZORO] But it seems to me
we're not even moving.

00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,868
You feel that?

We've entered the Calm Belt!

The Clam Belt?

00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:55,942
[LUFFY]
What's that?

53
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,943
[NAMI]
Calm Belt!

54
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,279
A part of the sea where
nothing moves a muscle!

55
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,947
[LUFFY]
So there's mussels and clams?!

00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,615
[NAMI]
No!

57
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,858
What was that? An earthquake?

58
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,760
A good trick since we're at sea.

59
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,962
All of this chitchat isn't
going to get us outta here.

Fold the sails and
start paddling now!

You can count on me.

Don't panic.

64
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,305
And besides, this is a sailboat.
Why do we need to paddle?

65
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,472
[USOPP]
True.

66
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,874
And why would we go through
the trouble of doubling back

67
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,142
when the Marines
are waiting for us?

68
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,545
Look, there's no time to argue.
Just shut up and do as I say!

69
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,480
At least it's nice
and quiet here.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,481
[NAMI]
Ugh!

00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,584
Fine! If I need to explain
it to you, I will!

72
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,385
In our haste to escape
from the Marines,

73
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,820
we ended up going too far south

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,056
and now we're off course
and stuck out here.

75
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,792
[LUFFY] South? So we
entered the Grand Line?

76
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,660
[USOPP]
Woohoo!

77
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,661
If we were at the Grand Line,

78
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,764
you think I'd waste my
time explaining this?!

79
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,800
Now look!

80
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,668
The Grand Line is
sandwiched in the middle

81
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:59,505
between these two green areas
you see here, ya understand?

82
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,007
These areas, just
as they're labeled,

83
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,642
are what's called
the Calm Belts.

84
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,644
That's where we are!

85
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,846
Nobody knows why,
but inside the Calm Belt,

86
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,581
there's no wind and no current.

87
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,950
It's like a void where
everything's stagnate.

88
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,519
Given that sailboats move
by catching winds,

89
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,356
this is more than a dangerous
region, it can be fatal!

90
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,523
Get it?

91
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,626
[LUFFY] Nope, but it sounds
like we're in big trouble.

92
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,028
[NAMI] Good. You retained more
than I thought you would.

93
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,696
[SANJI] So this is what
that geezer meant

94
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,598
when he said it was dangerous.

95
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,966
[ZORO] Well that explains
why we haven't gotten

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,101
a single gust of wind.

97
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,435

How're we gonna get outta this

98
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,803
if our ship can't move?

99
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,839
[LUFFY] Maybe the wind'll
start blowing again.

100
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,441
[NAMI] Wind never blows
in the Calm Belt!

101
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,376
And that's not all.

102
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,543
There's another good reason

103
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,846
that people call this
area dangerous.

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,447

[LUFFY]
Sea Monsters! They're gigantic!

111
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,085
The Calm Belt is also
home to the Sea Kings.

00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,087
It's their main place
for breeding.

113

They're the biggest reason

00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,942
It was named because
it looks like a warship!

177
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,044
Yeah, I see it now!

178
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,187
[VILLAGER A]
That ship's flag!

179
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,289
They're pirates!

180
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,626
Pirates are coming!
We're being invaded by pirates!

181
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,293
Pirates?!

182
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,128
Stay inside!

183
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,217
I'm home! Hi, everyone!

184
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,953
[VILLAGERS gasp]

185
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,789
What are you doing?
Why are you with pirates?

186
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,926
[VILLAGER A] Why did you
bring them here, Apis?

187
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,662
Hey, you, I have a question.

188
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,163
Yeah? What do you want?

189
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,233
Do you know of any good
barbecue restaurants here?

190
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,002
[VILLAGERS]
Huh?

191
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,071
What kind of a question
is that, pirate?

192
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,675
Relax! They're not bad pirates.
They're nice and helpful!

193
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,943
I didn't think there
was such a thing

194
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,344
as a nice and helpful pirate.

195
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,278
[APIS]
Yep!

196
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,513
How is it you ended up
with these people?

197
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,349
The last time we saw you, you
were taken away by the Marines.

198
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,350
That's right.

199
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,352
But I escaped from the Marines.

200
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,921
and then... I was
stranded in the ocean,

201
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,923
but they rescued me
just in time.

202
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,924
[LUFFY]
Yep.

203
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,125
[VILLAGER A] Apis, why
were you taken from us

204
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,327
in the first place?

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,696
[VILLAGER B] Yeah, the reason
the Marines came after you

206
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,797
is a mystery!

207
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,365
[VILLAGER C] It isn't safe
for you to stay here.

208
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,334
Those Marines are
still lurking around.

209
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,868
Where should I go?

210
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,438
[VILLAGER C] We really would
like to help, but...

211
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,374
Wait a minute! These strangers
are pirates, right?

212
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,309
Ehh... So what do I do?

213
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,378
Listen, we aren't
out to get you.

214
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,379
[BOKUDEN]
Apis.

215
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,881
[ALL gasp]

216
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,317
Come to my house, child.

217
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,852
[APIS]
Huh?

218
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,023
[NAMI] Who's that?

219
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,391
Don't know.

220
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,327
Grandpa Bokuden!

221
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,228
[BOKUDEN chuckles]

222
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,197
I'm glad you're safe, precious.

223
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,199
Thank you for saving
my granddaughter's life.

224
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm in your debt.

225
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,067
I know.

226
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,370
In honor of Apis' safe return,

227
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,239
I'll throw a celebration
for you and your crew.

228
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,808
What's on the menu?
Maybe barbecue?

229
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,744
Sorry, I'm afraid not, Luffy.

230
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,379
But Grandpa Bokuden's pork buns

231
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,515
are the best in
the whole island!

232
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,751
All right! Let's eat!

233
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,252
Sure, I could eat.

234
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,831
[gasps]

235
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,237
[MARINE A]
There she is!

236
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,915
Eric!

237
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,051
I've been here all along, Sir.

238
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,019
[NELSON] I was under the
impression that the girl

239
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,356
got lost in the Calm Belt,
never to return alive.

240
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,959
That's right. She is no more.

241
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,895
No, she's‐‐

242
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,369
[NELSON]
She's back on Warship Island!

243
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,806
Go capture her!
And don't fail me!

244
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,577
You can be sure she won't
slip through our grasp again.

245
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,003
[BOKUDEN]
There we go.

246
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,173
Almost ready.
Just a little bit longer now.

247
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,508
Can't wait!

248
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,909
Smells good!

249
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,411
Finally, real food.

250
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,513
Old man, how much longer
do we have to wait?

251
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,814
[BOKUDEN]
Hm?

252
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,119
Oh, well, if I had to guess, I'd
say no more than 4 or 5 hours.

253
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,987
[LUFFY, USOPP]
What?!

254
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,355
[LUFFY groans]

255
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,157
I'm so hungry.

256
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,526
[NAMI] Bokuden, why are
the Marines after Apis?

257
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,361
What could they
possibly be after?

258
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,864
Apis, do you know why?

259
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,831
[APIS]
No, sir!

260
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,999
[NAMI] That's not
what you said earlier.

261
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,868
You knew but refused to tell.

262
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,202
[APIS]
Oh, that? I lied.

263
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,137
[USOPP]
Huh?

264
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,938
Well... then I don't know...

265
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,939
[USOPP]
You're kidding me!

266
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,141
I'm sorry,

267
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,543
but there's really nothing
significant about this island.

268
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,546
Nothing, I reckon,
except for an old legend.

269
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,547
A legend?

270
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,349
[BOKUDEN] Some say the
people of this island

271
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,951
are descendants of
those from Lost Island,

272
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,554
which sank into the sea
thousands of years ago.

273
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,158
It was also home to
the Millennial Dragons.

274
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,494
The bones of these dragons
are called Dragonite.

275
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,199
Or the Elixir of Immortality.

276
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,333
But it doesn't make sense

277
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,036
that the Marines would invade
your home over a legend.

278
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,004
And why steal the girl?

279
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,005
[USOPP]
I agree.

280
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,207
They'd have to have a
better reason than that.

281
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,376
[NAMI] It certainly sounds
desperate to me.

282
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,079
We're overlooking something.
Maybe the legend holds a clue.

283
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,348
Well then, we should
start at the beginning...

284
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,383
Here we go again...

285
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,351
Kill me now.

286
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,354
[BOKUDEN] ...his heir,
Poke‐Portes, had three children.

287
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,590
The eldest was Boke‐Hontas.

288
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,092
The second son was
Boke‐Bon‐Boko,

289
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,261
and the third was Boke‐Boke‐Pon.

290
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,530
One day, the king said
to his three children,

291
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,265
"Listen to me and obey.

292
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,601
Go find the tree
that grows stars,

293
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,170
which is said to be
in dragon's valley."

294
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,941
So Boke‐Hontas, Boke‐Bon‐Boko,
and Boke‐Boke‐Pon journeyed...

295
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,275
Thank goodness
I got outta there.

296
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,612
Once Grandpa starts that story,
he goes on forever.

297
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,614
[BOKUDEN]
Now, the 317th ruler,

298
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,351
King Ingri‐Mongri the 3rd's son,
Ingri‐Grimori, was quite...

299
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,687
[NAMI] I thought this was a
legend, not a history lesson.

300
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,621
[USOPP]
Who knows...

301
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,957
[snoring]

302
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,592
[BOKUDEN] He was responsible for
implementing major reforms...

303
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,594
[snoring]

304
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,195
Ohh... I'm starving.

305
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,531
I think it'll be a while
before we eat again.

306
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:28,100
[USOPP] Those pork buns smell
delicious. I want them now!

307
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,602
Pork buns, wh‐‐?

308
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,404
[BOKUDEN] ...65 offspring,
most of them boys...

309
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:32,972
Luffy?

310
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,074
[LUFFY]
Restroom...

311
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,755
Hold on, Grandpa Ryu.

312
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,257
Oh no!

313
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,062
He's coming here! What do I do?!

314
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,003
Please go! Don't make me!

315
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,338
Oh, yeah... Yummy.

316
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,777
‐‐[thud]
‐‐[LUFFY snoring]

317
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,413
[APIS]
No way!

318
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,083
Hold on. I didn't
even hit him yet.

319
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,519
Pork... bun...

320
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:31,030
[BOKUDEN] And the 1,111‐‐ No,
the 1,121 king, was Hoke‐Hontas.

321
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,165
He ruled during the most savage,
bloody period in our history...

322
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,533
Hey. Where are you
sneaking off to?

323
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,468
It's okay. Luffy's been
gone a long time.

324
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,104
I'm gonna go check
on him. Be right back.

325
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,205
Uh! No fair.

326
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,775
Nami's simply gorgeous,
even when she's sneaking around!

327
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,110
[NAMI] Ugh. Give it a
rest already, grandpa!

328
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,279
[LUFFY snoring]

329
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,614
[NAMI]
Luffy!

330
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,218
[screams]

331
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,154
[NAMI]
Every bit of food is gone!

332
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,222
So delicious!

333
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,691
What is everyone else gonna eat

334
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,626
now that you've
inhaled everything?!

335
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,061
What? I didn't eat them.

336
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,228
Right.

337
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,665
[NAMI]
This is odd.

338
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,802
There's a trail.

339
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,741
[LUFFY]
Hm... A dead end?

340
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,743
It makes no sense...

341
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,314
[NAMI] Why are you sticking
your head in the bush?

342
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,549
[LUFFY]
Hey, look.

343
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,115
[NAMI]
Looks like the trail picks up

344
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,384
on the other side of this cliff.

345
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:58,884
Luffy!

346
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,854
Gotcha! Gum‐Gum!

347
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,722
Suspension Bridge.

348
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,295
Grandpa Ryu!

349
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,435
[NAMI] We're on the other
side of the mountain.

350
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,437
[LUFFY]
How far are they gonna go?

351
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,475
Uh! A cave!

352
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,411
[APIS]
Yes, everything turned out fine.

353
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,547
This funny group of pirates
saved me and brought me home.

354
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,483
No, they're not scary at all.
They were very good to me.

355
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,584
I knew you'd be hungry,

356
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,254
so I brought you some of
Grandpa Bokuden's pork buns.

357
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,255
Here you go.

358
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,324
Whoa! Slow down!
You're gonna make yourself sick!

359
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,559
Sorry. I still don't know.

360
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,762
I'm searching as hard as I can,
but I haven't found a clue.

361
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,831
I'll sort this all out.
I promise.

362
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,801
Listen. That's Apis, and
she's talking to someone.

363
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,804
Hey! Apis! Where'd you
put all the pork buns?

364
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,339
Luffy, you're an idiot!

365
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,510
Stay back! Don't come near!

366
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,283
[gasps]

367
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,953
Luffy, what the hell
are you gawking at?

368
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,456
[screams]

369
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,470
[LUFFY] Amazing! I can't
believe this! I‐It's amazing!

370
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,337
Hey, Luffy!

371
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,806
You do exist. I knew it.
That's awesome!

372
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,209
Get off of him! Leave him alone!

373
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,343
[NAMI]
Is this possible?

374
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,479
I thought dragons
were just legends.

375
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,781
But here's one right
before my eyes!

376
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:40,152
Incredible! Where in the
world did you come from?!

377
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,497
[LUFFY]
Sure, I think I understand.

378
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,166
You wanna go home. Is that it?

379
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,738
[APIS]
Okay.

380
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,840
Luffy, Grandpa Ryu says
it's fine with him

381
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,375
if you wanna be his friend.

382
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,211
He says he can tell
you're a good person.

383
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,847
[chuckles]

384
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,250
Hey, I've been able to
read Grandpa Ryu's mind,

385
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,718
but how did you do it?

386
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,652
I just did.

387
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,553
[APIS]
But how?

388
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,588
I dunno. It just happened.
How'd you know?

389
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,757
[APIS]
I, um...

390
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,192
Oh...

391
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,694
Could it be... a Devil Fruit?

392
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,697
It's okay. Really, there's
no need to be shy about it.

393
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,231
[APIS]
Mh‐hm.

394
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,399
Yeah, I ate one once.

395
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,667
It was called the Whisper
Whisper Fruit or something.

396
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,870
Since then, I've been able to
read the mind of any animal.

397
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,372
So that was it.

398
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,541
How you knew that gust
of wind was coming.

399
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,675
[APIS]
Mh‐hm.

400
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,544
The seabirds were kind
enough to tell me about it.

401
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,379
It was thanks to the
Whisper Whisper Fruit

402
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,881
that I met Grandpa Ryu as well.

403
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,560
Who's there?

404
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,801
[APIS] I remember the first
time I heard his voice.

405
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,703
It was so sad.

406
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,383
I'll help you! Just hold on!

407
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,430
It was you who
called me, wasn't it?

408
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,565
[APIS] When I found him,
he was helpless.

409
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,067
He'd used up the
last of his energy

410
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,668
searching for his friends.

411
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,503
He got separated from
them while flying home

412
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,573
to the Dragons' Nest
on Lost Island.

413
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,774
Wait a minute.

414
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,444
I thought Lost Island sank
into the sea a long time ago.

415
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,646
Lost Island will surface
again eventually.

416
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,015
Grandpa Ryu is absolutely
certain about that.

417
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,618
Grandpa believes the island
will reappear any day now.

418
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,086
But while he's pretty sure
about the "when,"

419
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,787
it's the "where" that's
causing the problem.

420
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,990
He doesn't remember
where it used to be.

421
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,157
It's not his fault.

422
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,094
Grandpa's just gotten old
and lost the energy to fly.

423
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,996
But his spirit's
as strong as ever.

424
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,632
He keeps telling me he wants
to go back to Lost Island

425
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,633
more than anything.

426
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,502
If only I could figure out
a way to find it.

427
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,105
I've searched through old
records, studied ancient maps.

428
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,107
The legend itself doesn't
hold any clues.

429
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,608
So when the Marines stopped by,

430
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,844
I took a chance and
asked for their help.

431
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,045
That was a big mistake.

432
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,713
The only thing they
were interested in

433
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,315
was finding Dragonite.

434
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,983
[NAMI] As in the source
for immortality?

435
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,385
So that's why they
kidnapped you?

436
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,786
To help them find Dragonite?

437
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,787
[APIS]
Yes.

438
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,656
They wanted me to tell
them everything I knew,

439
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,823
but I wouldn't.

440
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,825
Then they became obsessed
when they noticed the pendant

441
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,495
I'd made with a claw
Grandpa Ryu gave me.

442
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,330
[NAMI] Then you escaped
during that storm.

443
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,665
This is all too dangerous.

444
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,799
[APIS]
I know.

445
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,501
That's why I've kept this
a secret from the others,

446
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,502
even Grandpa Bokuden.

447
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,038
I don't wanna cause any
more trouble for them.

448
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,674
But I have to make sure Grandpa
Ryu gets back to his home,

449
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:49,808
no matter what it takes.

450
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,410
It's the only way to save him.

451
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,844
He says that he'll
get his energy back

452
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,480
once he returns to
the Dragons' Nest.

453
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:56,882
I'll find a way
to get him there,

454
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,518
no matter if it takes
me a lifetime!

455
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,486
I know how painful
it feels to be far

456
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,989
from home and
everything you love.

457
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,527
Right! If he wants to
go home, then I'll take him!

458
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,394
Huh?

459
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,863
Luffy! Wake up!
You can't take him home!

460
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,566
Lost Island sank into
the sea, remember?!

461
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,569
Look at him. This is a
legendary Millennial Dragon!

462
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,172
He really exists, which
means Lost Island does too!

463
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,940
Luffy, the island sank!

464
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,710
I know! And now
we're gonna find it!

465
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,713
Underwater. No map. It's insane.

466
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,380
I'm in!

467
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,047
All right!

468
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,082
You'll really take him?!

469
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:30,749
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

470
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,717
Ah, thank you!

471
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,418
[LUFFY] But first
things first, let's eat.

472
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,419
Luffy, wait!

473
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,589
There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you.

474
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,960
Grandpa Ryu is kinda senile.

475
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,567
[ERIC]
That brat was wearing a pendant

476
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,902
that prominently featured
a Millennial Dragon's claw.

477
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,970
Therefore, it stands to reason

478
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,906
she knows all about its
sanctuary, the Lost Island.

479
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,809
That means she must hold
the secret of the Dragonite.

480
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,045
I'll have her soon enough.

without asking us first?
