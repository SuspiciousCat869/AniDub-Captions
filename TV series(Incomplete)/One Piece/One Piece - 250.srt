1
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,315
Damn you!

2
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,126
CP9 has finally
revealed themselves.

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:31,065
Their true identities are
Lucci, Kaku, Blueno, and Kalifa.

4
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,267
Luffy and Zoro stood up
to them in an attempt

5
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,036
to thwart their plans,
but were easily defeated

6
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,538
by Lucci and his
Cat-Cat fruit powers.

7
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,409
CP9 discovered that Franky
was actually Cutty Flam,

8
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,345
who most likely
holds the blueprints

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,113
for the ancient weapon Pluton.

10
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,582
Oh, did you just say hand?

11
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,823
Franky challenged them,

12
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:59,292
but was no match for the
power of Lucci and CP9.

13
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,029
Now that hurt.

14
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,369
All right, now time
for some payback.

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,105
We won't leave 'til we
get what we're after.

16
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,607
Make this easy on yourself.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,109
There ain't no
blueprints in here!

18
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,417
Stay back!

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,238
Dammit! Where am I?

20
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,206
Oh, come on!

21
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,543
Not again! Stupid walls!

22
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,678
I have to hurry!

23
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,255
All right. Just as planned.

24
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,542
That's what the
government did to us.

25
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,545
They used your creations
to hurt a lot of people.

26
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,213
People we care about!

27
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,549
And now they're gonna
put the blame on us.

28
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,451
They want to back
Tom into a corner

29
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,453
so they can get
those blueprints.

30
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,587
After all this

31
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,523
you still think your hands
don't have blood on them?!

32
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,695
If Tom gets taken away,
if he hangs for this.

33
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,666
I swear on my life.
I will never forgive you!

34
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,740
Never! You unders--

35
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,508
Stop it!

36
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,076
Tom!

37
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,213
It's not his fault,
don't blame him.

38
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,415
He didn't do this.

39
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,817
You still believe that, after
everything that happened?!

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,187
Oh, no...

41
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,391
This is... This is one of
the special harpoons I made!

42
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,760
Once it pierces its target,
you can't pull it out!

43
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,362
I'm so sorry!

44
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,698
Haha. Don't apologize!

45
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,434
It's barely even
a scratch! Heh.

46
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,403
Over there! We found them!

47
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,038
Tom's been injured!

48
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,673
Wait, why is he hurt?

49
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,608
Weren't they the ones
behind the attack?

50
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,643
It doesn't make any sense!

51
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,279
The townspeople, they're here.

52
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,716
Now then.

53
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,587
I believe this is the part
where you come along quietly.

54
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,322
Damn you, Spanda!

55
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,290
Spandam, you fool.

56
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,426
Now let's get going,
you criminals.

57
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,679
The Day the Sea
Train Cried!"

58
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,319
These are the culprits
behind the attack!

59
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,453
Rest easy, everyone!

60
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:57,424
We, the men of CP5, have
destroyed their attack ships.

61
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,794
They'll cause
no more trouble.

62
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,463
I'm sure the judge would
have acquitted him

63
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,198
of those old charges today.

64
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,500
If so, then why did he
do something like that?

65
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,168
He was friends with
the King of the Pirates.

66
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,770
Who knows what
he's capable of?

67
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,072
Pleased to meet you,
your honor.

68
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,742
My name is Spandam.
I'm with CP5.

69
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,811
A pleasure.
And thanks, you saved us.

70
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,114
We can take over the
investigation from here,

71
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,015
if you don't mind.

72
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,383
We'll give them a
full interrogation.

73
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,820
Just try talking your
way out of this one.

74
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,590
The trust they had in
you has been shattered.

75
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:34,228
Soon, those blueprints for the
ancient weapon will be mine!

76
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,496
--Gerro, gerro!
--How could this happen?

77
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:44,238
First off, about the Sea Train.
Magnificent work.

78
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,741
With its help, Water 7 will
continue to grow and flourish.

79
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,744
For that, on the previous charge
of building Gold Roger's ship,

80
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,481
your acquittal today had pretty
much already been decided.

81
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,650
Knowing that, why in the
world would you commit

82
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,219
such a heinous crime
and erase that opportunity?

83
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,454
Please, explain yourself.

84
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,655
That's a lie!

85
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,358
It wasn't Tom or any of us
that attacked the Judicial Ship!

86
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,759
It was that
idiot, Spandam!

87
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,627
He's the one responsible!

88
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,036
Sure it was!

89
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,338
He's not serious, is he?

90
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,341
What kind of crap
is he trying to pull?

91
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,777
Why would a government agency
like CP5 attack a Judicial Ship?

92
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,811
There's no way!

93
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,147
You're gonna have to
come up with a better lie

94
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,349
than that, Mr. Apprentice.

95
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:32,519
Hahahah! Your name is
Cutty Flam, correct?

96
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,755
I believe that was the name
we took down from you

97
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,756
when we caught you red handed

98
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,592
on board one of those
treacherous raid ships.

99
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,361
And correct me if
I'm mistaken,

100
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,363
but weren't those
very same raid ships

101
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,631
all made by your company?

102
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,271
Ships that would do
such a horrible thing.

103
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,345
Something so awful,

104
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,481
are no longer my ships!

105
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,760
Tom tore off his chains!
He's on a rampage!

106
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,494
Take aim!

107
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,368
He just hit him.
Tom has never hit Franky before.

108
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,637
What'd you do that for?!

109
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,342
They are no longer
your ships, huh?

110
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,713
Don't you ever say that again!

111
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,216
What's wrong with saying that?!
I wish I'd never made them!

112
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,719
If those ships didn't exist,

113
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,620
then nobody would
have gotten hurt!

114
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:49,096
When a ship is built,
no matter what type

115
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,298
it's neither good nor evil.

116
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,034
I don't care what kind of ships

117
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,203
you choose to make for
the rest of your life.

118
00:08:56,236 --> 00:09:00,040
Remember, even if the ships
you build hurt someone,

119
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,409
even if they destroy the world.

120
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,677
Even if no one else does,

121
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,247
their creator must love
them unconditionally.

122
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,083
The one who made them
must never deny them!

123
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:11,685
Don't place the
blame on the ships!

124
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,387
You must be proud.

125
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,423
Of every ship
you've ever created!

126
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,378
Iceberg.

127
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,413
Franky.

128
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,380
Whatever happens,

129
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,483
don't interfere with
what I'm about to do.

130
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,517
No matter what.

131
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,555
It's the World Government
who pinned this crime on us,

132
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,690
and it's the World Government

133
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,492
who will be the
ones to judge it.

134
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,561
There's no way for us to be
cleared of these charges.

135
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,829
It's over.

136
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,400
It must be tough for you to see
your innocent ships being used

137
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,735
for something as
horrible as this.

138
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,739
I bet you really wanna hit
that guy, don't you, Franky?

139
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:16,684
What are you doing?!

140
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,219
He's going crazy again!

141
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:19,719
Gerro!

142
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,754
What is he doing?!

143
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,821
Stop it, please!

144
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,324
You're making things worse
than they already are!

145
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:29,063
Can you even comprehend the pain

146
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,531
that you've put
that boy through?!

147
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,799
Fire!

148
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,671
They shot him!

149
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,416
Tom, no!

150
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,704
Tom, no!

151
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,341
Tranquillizers, huh?

152
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:23,417
Not so tough now, are you?!
Serves you right, fishman!

153
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,053
Tom! Wait!
Why are you doing this?!

154
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,655
What are you
standing around for?

155
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,490
Get over there and
apprehend them!

156
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,492
We're going to take Tom
and every last one

157
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,328
of his villainous workers
down to Enies Lobby!

158
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,164
Who would have thought that Tom
could be such a dangerous guy?

159
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,633
What the hell was
he thinking?

160
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,035
Just what you'd you expect from

161
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,038
a man who sold his
soul to pirates!

162
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,105
He made those battleships and

163
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,041
waited around for a chance
like this to use them!

164
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,810
How dare you talk about him
like that, you bastards!

165
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,478
Stop it.

166
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,447
It's all right.

167
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,615
But, Tom!

168
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,418
I'd like to confess.

169
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,421
The raid on the Judicial
Ship was led by me.

170
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,825
That's not true!
Why would you say that?!

171
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,127
But I have a request.

172
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,762
Save your breath, fishman!

173
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,097
Nobody gives a
damn about your--!

174
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,434
Shut your mouth, CP5!

175
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,402
So, what is
this request?

176
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,172
If building the sea train was
supposed to be considered

177
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,608
a pardon for one
charge against me.

178
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:24,778
Then I'd like to be pardoned
for today's charges.

179
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,413
Even if that request
is granted,

180
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,083
you'll be right back to where
you were to begin with.

181
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:32,186
With a charge of building a ship
for the King of the Pirates,

182
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,755
which will result
in the maximum penalty.

183
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:35,422
Sounds good.

184
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,690
I like that better, anyway.

185
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,728
Giving a hand to that Roger guy
is something I'll never forget.

186
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,764
In fact, it's something
I take great pride in!

187
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,202
He's proud of that?

188
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,137
I can't believe he'd
make such a bold claim

189
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,739
about something so despicable!

190
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:52,673
Traitor!

191
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:53,707
Evil Fishman!

192
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,309
You'll regret that!

193
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,745
Why, Tom? Tell me!

194
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,313
It's for the best.

195
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:03,550
Now listen, don't
blame yourself for this.

196
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,753
I never thought the
World Government would go

197
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,689
to such extremes to
get the blueprints.

198
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:12,059
And the situation with Roger
only makes the matter worse.

199
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,161
Even so, it doesn't
have to be this way!

200
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,462
No, it's fine.

201
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,529
Look around you.

202
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,833
Even if I'm charged with
a crime from 14 years ago,

203
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,535
nothing else about this town

204
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,704
is the same now as
it was back then.

205
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,407
This island is alive and strong!

206
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,275
This is only
the beginning.

207
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,779
No matter what ends up
happening to me,

208
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,316
I was still able
to help this town.

209
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:42,055
My dream has
finally begun to run.

210
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,792
Tom! Don't! Please!

211
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,595
Tom, no!

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,707
Iceberg, Franky take care of
the blueprints.

213
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,046
Kokoro, Yokozuna thank you
for everything.

214
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,453
The tranquilizers
finally kicked in!

215
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,755
Capture those three for
the Judicial Ship attack!

216
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,089
Yes, sir!

217
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,660
Hold it!

218
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,395
I'm amending
the charges.

219
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:24,331
For the crime of designing
and building a ship

220
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,367
for Gold Roger, the
King of the Pirates.

221
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,702
Tom and Tom alone
will be apprehended

222
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,804
and taken to Enies Lobby.

223
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,305
That is all.

224
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:38,078
What in the hell got into
that old geezer's head?

225
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,148
Whatever, I don't
need his lackeys.

226
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,650
Release those
two apprentices!

227
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:52,626
Tom can't be saved from this.

228
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,495
It's the government
we're up against.

229
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,398
There's nothing we
can do! Endure it.

230
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,067
Tom traded his life for yours!

231
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,070
If you make them your enemy,
you won't be able to win,

232
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,073
no matter how many lives
you have to give!

233
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,209
Enies Lobby is the government's
personal judicial island.

234
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,779
Not one single person who's been

235
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:16,417
sent to that dreadful place
has ever been seen again!

236
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,519
The sea train is ready
for departure, sir!

237
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,287
We can leave
anytime you like!

238
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,221
Very good!

239
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,756
Kokoro.

240
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:27,194
Let's get moving, men!
Load up the prisoner!

241
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,328
I can't...

242
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:32,532
This bloated fishman is
going for a little train ride!

243
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,768
Endure this!

244
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,172
Hey!

245
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,013
Stop it!

246
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,822
Whoa! He really
messed up his face!

247
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:58,692
Now Tom's apprentice is
the one on a rampage!

248
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,226
No! Stop!

249
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,527
Gerro, gerro, gerro!

250
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,729
Capture that criminal!

251
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,632
The rest of you, take
Tom to the train!

252
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:06,066
That's not
gonna happen!

253
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,269
Nobody's taking
him anywhere!

254
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,471
Fire at will!

255
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:13,273
Tom's staying right here!

256
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,278
Are you okay?!

257
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,511
After him!

258
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,515
Hurry! Get out of here!

259
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,682
Fire!

260
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:36,363
Dammit! He got away!

261
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll get that Cutty Flam brat
if it's the last thing I do!

262
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,802
That little criminal will
pay for what he's done!

263
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,036
Mark my words.

264
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,440
Once this case is over, I'll
have him sent to the gallows!

265
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,575
Spandam! He's here!

266
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:48,542
What now?!

267
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,145
It's-It's Cutty
Flam, sir!

268
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,079
What?! Where?

269
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,248
Standing out on the
tracks ahead of us!

270
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:57,317
And it appears that he's
holding some sort of weapon!

271
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,691
Stay right there, Yokozuna.

272
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,726
Gerro, gerro.

273
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,528
He's out of his mind!

274
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,829
What should we do, sir?

275
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,231
Are you out of
your mind, too?!

276
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,700
We keep on going!

277
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,401
That's what he
wants us to do, right?

278
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,070
Don't worry about him!

279
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,737
Right! Y-Yes, sir!

280
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,442
All right, Puffing Tom.
That's far enough!

281
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,313
What do you think
you're doing?

282
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,548
Where are you taking
your creator?

283
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,361
Gerro, gerro, gerro!

284
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,432
I won't let you pass!

285
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,273
Give me Tom back!

286
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,745
You hear me?!
Stop now, sea train!

287
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,016
I see!

288
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,085
So your parents just
abandoned you, huh?

289
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,754
That's terrible!

290
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,522
Hey! Stop laughing at me!

291
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,358
Fine then.
Come stay with me.

292
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,494
Tom.

293
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,428
I don't want to build
ships anymore.

294
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,768
I can't love ships that hurt the
people I care so much about!

295
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:23,270
I won't do it!

296
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:29,075
But even so, my goal in
life is to be just like you!

297
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:39,586
Come back!

298
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,156
Come back and
teach me once again!

299
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:56,069
Cause someday I want to
build my own dream ship!

300
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,744
A ship that will proudly
sail bravely over

301
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:08,515
uncharted waters all the way
to the ends of the world!

302
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,432
We've heard that Tom was
an excellent craftsman

303
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,701
and a creative
genius but he was also

304
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,638
an uncontrollable fishman
with superhuman strength.

305
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,673
When we ask the
citizens here about him,

306
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,175
they don't really
have much to say.

307
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,477
It must be difficult to

308
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,712
apprentice under
a man like that.

309
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,547
Right, Cutty Flam?

310
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,651
That ridiculous question
doesn't even deserve a reply.

311
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,287
You Government goons
are all piles of crap!

312
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,721
Easy, easy!

313
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,790
During that incident,
more than 100 people,

314
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,625
including Marines
and Navy officers,

315
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,728
were severely injured
here in Water 7.

316
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,830
And the culprit
behind it was you.

317
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,499
Causing the World Government

318
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,268
that much trouble
is a serious crime.

319
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,770
But because you were
confirmed dead

320
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,139
in a sea train accident
later that same day,

321
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,342
all of the charges against
you were annulled.

322
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,311
Since you're
actually still alive,

323
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:12,379
you'll be taken to
Enies Lobby as a criminal.

324
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,415
There, you can take your time

325
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,217
answering this one
simple question.

326
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,819
Where are the secret blueprints

327
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,221
for the ancient weapon
known as Pluton?

328
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,324
Now, Blueno.

329
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:27,727
Right, I was just able
to get a connection.

330
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,401
When I reported
our latest findings

331
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,137
on this case to our superior,
he said that he wanted to

332
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,174
speak with you directly
and immediately.

333
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:43,143
Superior, huh?

334
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,645
All right, Chief. Go ahead.

335
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,481
Hot! Hot! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

336
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,216
I spilled coffee
all over myself!

337
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,452
Dammit! Stupid coffee!

338
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:55,055
What the heck?

339
00:20:55,088 --> 00:21:00,394
So, you're still alive.
Greetings Cutty Flam.

340
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,663
Long time no see.

341
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:04,164
It's hard to believe you

342
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:07,434
somehow managed to
survive the "accident."

343
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:12,306
Hard to believe.
But good news, nonetheless.

344
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,642
Is that so?
Who are you?

345
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,778
For the past eight years,
every time my scars hurt,

346
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:20,214
I was tormented by
an unquenchable anger

347
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:24,084
that I couldn't take the
proper vengeance I deserved.

348
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,686
Because the criminal responsible

349
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:28,622
for those scars
was dead, you see.

350
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:32,826
I said who in
the hell are you?

351
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,629
Don't you remember me?

352
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,269
I'm the man from
Cipher Pol Number 5

353
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,272
that arrested Tom's Workers
when I caught them red-handed

354
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:49,175
for savagely attacking the
Judicial Ship 8 years ago!

355
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,131
I've been looking
forward to seeing you.

356
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,632
Wait is that you, Spanda?

357
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,768
Spandam! Spandam!

358
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,102
There's an "M" at the end!

359
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,103
Lucci!

360
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,139
Hurry up and bring them
to Enies Lobby already!

361
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:25,773
Yes, sir.

362
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,441
Hey! Hold on! Let him go!

363
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:27,975
What was that?

364
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,043
Uh, nothing! Sorry!

365
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,511
On the next One Piece:

366
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:32,613
"The Truth Behind
Her Betrayal!

367
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:34,615
Robin's Sorrowful Decision!"

368
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,017
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
