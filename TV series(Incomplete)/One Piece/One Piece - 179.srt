1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,041
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,258
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,178
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:52,519
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,048
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,843
[NARRATOR]
We last saw our heroes

25
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:27,137
in God Eneru's land,
the Upper Yard.

26
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,932
Zoro clashed with the priest
Ohm in the Upper Ruins.

27
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:34,352
[ZORO] Three lives hold
108 worldly desires!

28
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:38,982
Three swords...
108 Caliber Phoenix!

29
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,200
[NARRATOR] Luffy and the
others found themselves

30
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,952
in the belly of a giant snake,

31
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:53,830
and it seemed Wyper
would soon join them.

32
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:56,499
[ALL screaming]

33
00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:01,004
[NARRATOR] Upon finding
the ruins of Shandora,

34
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:05,258
the City of Gold, Robin
encountered the god Eneru.

35
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:09,679
While Conis learned of
Eneru's horrifying secret.

36
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:13,099
[MAN A] Skypiea will be dropped
back into the Blue Sea world,

37
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,810
and this entire nation
will no longer exist!

38
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,103
[CONIS gasping]

39
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,610
[CONIS yelps]

40
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:29,366
Father!

41
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:50,512
[LUFFY] "Collapsing Upper Ruins!
The Quintet for the Finale!"

42
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,721
[CONIS whimpering]

43
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,387
[SUU]
Suu...

44
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,638
Suu.

45
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:19,768
[CONIS]
Suu...

46
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:23,104
[CONIS cries]

47
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,606
[MAN A]
There's no time to lose.

48
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,024
You must tell everyone.

49
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:28,568
Soon our lives will be over.

50
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:32,030
Eneru will eliminate
everything from the sky.

51
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,455
[ENERU laughing]

52
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,040
[gasps]

53
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:45,502
Skypiea's going to be dropped
back into the Blue Sea world,

54
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:50,298
and this entire nation
will no longer exist!

55
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,716
[CONIS]
I can't.

56
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,094
I can't just sit here and cry.

57
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,887
There's no time to lose.

58
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,223
I must take action.

59
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,852
[CONIS] I have to do
everything I can.

60
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:06,314
I have to tell the people
what's going to happen.

61
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:14,531
[SUU]
Suu.

62
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:18,493
[CONIS] I want you to stay and
take care of these two, Suu.

63
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,413
Because there's something
important I have to do.

64
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,669
[CONIS] I have to warn them,
no matter what it takes.

65
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:31,089
I won't let your death
be in vain, Father.

66
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:32,757
[SUU]
Suu Suu!

67
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,774
[ZORO] Huh. That took
a lot longer than expected.

68
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:53,570
Guess I need to do a
little more training.

69
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:57,073
That's weird. Got awfully
quiet here all of a sudden.

70
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,199
Huh?

71
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,869
[ZORO grunts]
No!

72
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:03,997
[panting]

73
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,373
[ZORO]
...huh?!

74
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,375
You mean this dog
obeys anyone?

75
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,418
[barks]

76
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,836
[sighs]

77
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,172
In that case, just knock
yourself unconscious.

78
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:13,840
[thud]

79
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,929
There's no time to waste.

80
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:22,891
I gotta hurry and take care of
that snake and the bazooka guy.

81
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:25,477
I don't have time for this
fight to drag on forever.

82
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,228
Why don't you just die already?

83
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,189
[roars]

84
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,025
[WYPER growls]

85
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:36,071
This battle ends now!
I'm through dealing with you!

86
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,248
No matter what I do I can't
seem to damage this thing.

87
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,335
[SNAKE roars]

88
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:53,880
I guess it's up to me
to put an end to this.

89
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,049
[ZORO yells]

90
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:04,182
That attack didn't
even faze him.

91
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,935
Dammit. It's like his scales
are made of steel.

92
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:10,271
[roaring]

93
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:14,025
Jeez... What in the world
is going on out there?

94
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,652
If this keeps up much
longer I don't know

95
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,404
if we'll be able to
make it out of here.

96
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:18,655
[LUFFY]
Hey! Someone help me!

97
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:21,783
This is killing my face!
Get me out!

98
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:28,373
[ZORO] Nami had better
still be alive in there.

99
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:34,671
[gasps] What exactly
did you just do?

100
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,216
I showed mercy.

101
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,885
A pitiful worm was in
a great deal of pain,

102
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,097
so I saved him by releasing
him from his torment.

103
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,892
I performed my duties as god.

104
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:51,980
It seems the young woman is
still behaving desperately.

105
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,316
But desperation is the most
interesting emotion.

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,735
[ROBIN gasping]

107
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:59,070
Soon enough, true despair
will be something

108
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:01,156
everyone fully understands.

109
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:05,535
[ROBIN]
This man, he has Logia Power!

110
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:08,621
And now, I must say that what
little time we have left here

111
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,248
is coming to a close.

112
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:12,334
This is the beginning
of the end.

113
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,919
I will now set into motion
a series of events

114
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,505
that will reveal
my ultimate plan.

115
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,592
What plan? What do you mean?

116
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,055
[ENERU]
The Sky Lord is calling to you!

117
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:29,184
Heed my call, lowly
beings, and come to me!

118
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,770
[ROBIN gasps]

119
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,107
[ENERU]
Sango!

120
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:44,282
What the...?

121
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,379
What are you doing?

122
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,172
[ENERU laughs]

123
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,049
[ENERU]
It was I who brought you

124
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:03,593
and your friends
here to Shandora.

125
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:05,804
I beckoned you.

126
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:08,807
[ROBIN] I've never seen
anything like this before.

127
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,060
This man possesses
such tremendous power.

128
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:21,486
[roaring]

129
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:23,947
The whole place
is falling apart.

130
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,323
[WYPER]
It's Eneru!

131
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,033
He's the only one
who's powerful enough

132
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:29,119
to do something like this.

133
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,332
I better think of something.

134
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,751
[gasps] Chopper!

135
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,505
[ZORO yelling, gasps]

136
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,633
[ZORO grunts]

137
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,969
[ZORO groans]

138
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:53,059
What's that...?
There's a hole at the base.

139
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,652
[ENERU laughing]

140
00:11:02,736 --> 00:11:06,364
And now this brings us
to our climactic finale.

141
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:09,200
[WYPER yelling]

142
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,368
[WYPER, ZORO yelling]

143
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,371
[SNAKE growls]

144
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,665
[GAN FALL] I suggest we
attempt our escape now.

145
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:18,209
Right. Yeah.
It's now or never.

146
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,420
Luffy get over here and
grab hold of the waver.

147
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:22,797
I'm gonna finally get
us out of this snake.

148
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,593
Right. Hey, you, hang on to me.

149
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:28,553
Ready. Start the engine.

150
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,138
Here we go!

151
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:31,973
[engine revs]

152
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,684
Yay. Can't wait to get out.

153
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:35,977
[AISA, LUFFY yelp]

154
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,855
[GAN FALL] Man overboard!
We can't leave them!

155
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,484
Pierre, go back! You have
to save those two!

156
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,985
[GAN FALL screams]

157
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,528
[PIERRE squawks]

158
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:48,031
[NAMI screams]

159
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,532
[NAMI gasps]

160
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,454
[NAMI gasping]

161
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:56,206
How'd we get so high up?

162
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,958
[GAN FALL]
I have no idea!

163
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:03,630
Pierre! Don't worry about me!
You have to save the others!

164
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,423
Pierre!

165
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,678
[NAMI] So what are we gonna
do now that the bird's gone,

166
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,929
you weird old man?!

167
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,139
[GAN FALL]
My name's Gan Fall.

168
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:14,808
It's Gan Fall!

169
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,477
[NAMI]
I don't care! Just save us!

170
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,353
[whimpers]

171
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,397
[screams]

172
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,633
What just happened?

173
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,636
Why did all these ruins
fall out of the sky?

174
00:12:57,684 --> 00:13:00,812
[panting]

175
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,690
[ROBIN]
Swordsman!

176
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:05,316
[ZORO]
This is not my day...

177
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,319
[ROBIN] Don't tell me you fell
down here with all of this.

178
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:10,030
[ZORO grunts]

179
00:13:10,113 --> 00:13:11,781
Yeah, I did.

180
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,616
And it almost killed me.

181
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,994
[ROBIN]
I'm amazed it didn't.

182
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,121
Are you sure you're all right?

183
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:21,332
Yeah. Good to see ya, Robin.

184
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,793
Where am I?
What is this place?

185
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:27,547
[ROBIN] It's the city of gold
we've been looking for.

186
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,215
[ZORO]
City of gold, huh?

187
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,260
It doesn't look much different
than the ruins up above.

188
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,095
Did you find the treasure?

189
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,098
I didn't. There's no evidence
that gold was ever here.

190
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,309
[SNAKE growls]

191
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,745
[LUFFY, AISA screaming]

192
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:06,002
[gasps]

193
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:10,048
Wow! That was one crazy ride
if I do say so myself.

194
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:12,133
I think I wanna go again.

195
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,551
[AISA]
Are you stupid?!

196
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,054
Why in the world did you hold
onto the waver's jet?

197
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:18,181
[LUFFY laughing]
Sorry.

198
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,141
[AISA]
Everyone else managed to escape.

199
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,019
And we've been left behind
because of your stupidity.

200
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,104
It's all your fault!

201
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:25,021
[LUFFY]
Eh. Don't worry.

202
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,356
[AISA]
Get us outta here!

203
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,233
I've got an idea. Why don't
we make our way down

204
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,902
to the back of the snake and
escape out its butthole?

205
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,947
Think again jerk!
That's not gonna happen!

206
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:38,910
[LUFFY]
Look. It's the horse.

207
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:39,828
That's a bird!

208
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:43,248
[squawking]

209
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,625
[LUFFY] Uh? Are you trying to
tell us to get on your back?

210
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,127
[squawks]

211
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,587
[neighs]

212
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:50,964
How in the world did he do that?

213
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,799
[LUFFY laughs]

214
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,303
[screams] You're a freak, too!

215
00:14:57,387 --> 00:15:00,640
I ate a Gum Gum Fruit and it
turned me into a rubbery person.

216
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:03,101
That's why I can stretch
myself out like this.

217
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,812
Freaks! The both of you
are freaks of nature!

218
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:07,272
No, I'm a pirate.

219
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,314
Now come on. Let's go.

220
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:10,400
[gasps, screams]

221
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,819
Better hold on tight, okay?

222
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,029
Uh.

223
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:17,449
Now, I think it's time
we made our escape.

224
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,202
Let's go, horse!

225
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,873
Full speed ahead and don't
stop till you see the sky.

226
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:28,626
[PIERRE whinnies]

227
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:34,924
[NAMI]
Ow!

228
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:37,677
Thanks, Mr. Weirdo.

229
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:42,599
We just got lucky when
we landed on these clouds.

230
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,851
[NAMI]
We left Luffy and Aisa behind.

231
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:46,227
I hope they're okay.

232
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,271
Pierre's gone to
fetch your friends.

233
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:49,898
And when push comes to shove,

234
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:53,818
he's a very reliable
bird or horse.

235
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:57,030
Hey. Where did we end up?
What is this place?

236
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:01,743
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I have no idea where we are,

237
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:05,246
but it looks like we
fell through the clouds.

238
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,040
Thank you very much.

239
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,003
I've traveled all across
the Upper Yard in my lifetime,

240
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,923
but I've never seen
this place before.

241
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,758
[WYPER gasping]

242
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:32,148
Could it be? Is this
really our homeland?

243
00:16:47,997 --> 00:16:51,334
[SHANDORIAN WARRIORS]
Light the fire of Shandora!

244
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:54,879
In the name of the
Great Warrior Kalgara!

245
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,632
Light the Fire of Shandora!

246
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,845
[SHANDORIAN WARRIORS yelling]

247
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:03,847
[SHANDORIAN WARRIORS]
We're going back...

248
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,057
...to our Homeland!

249
00:17:09,185 --> 00:17:11,813
[WYPER] I've finally found
what I've been looking for!

250
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,400
The proud city that my
ancestors protected!

251
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:18,945
[WYPER]
Shandora!

252
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,498
[gasps]

253
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,418
[NAMI] I think the snake is
looking for something.

254
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,047
Either that or Luffy's doing
something that's bothering it.

255
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:45,430
Huh. That snake sure
is acting strangely.

256
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:52,103
[gasps] I think it's crying.

257
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,065
[roars]

258
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:57,817
What's the meaning of
this ridiculous outburst?

259
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:02,280
Just what are you getting
yourself so worked up about?

260
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,617
You've always been
an annoyance to me.

261
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:09,996
[ENERU]
But no longer.

262
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,625
El Thor!

263
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,546
[NAMI gasps]

264
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,381
Aisa!

265
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:21,841
Oh, no Nami! She's dead!

266
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,679
There's no way she
could have survived that!

267
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,222
Robin and Zoro?

268
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,140
When did you guys get here?

269
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,809
[ZORO]
Wait, what are you doin' there?

270
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,352
How'd you get outta
that snake's stomach?

271
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:35,230
Phew, glad to see you're
all right, Navigator.

272
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,981
Yeah, I think I'm all right,

273
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:41,653
but I'm not so sure...
about... the others.

274
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,530
Luffy was still in there.

275
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,990
Wha--?! What was he
doing in there?

276
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,202
I tried to get him out,
but he fell off the waver.

277
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:51,663
[ZORO] Uh! That brat is
nothing but a pain in the ass.

278
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,540
Is he aware of how much
of a hassle he is?

279
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:55,500
How am I supposed to know?!

280
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:03,216
[WYPER]
Just one hit.

281
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:04,592
That's all it took.

282
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,469
Eneru destroyed him
when my bazooka

283
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,638
couldn't even scratch the snake.

284
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:12,726
And Aisa. I can only hope
she somehow survived.

285
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,479
[growls]

286
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,487
[ENERU]
Ball Cloud!

287
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,740
Eneru!

288
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:30,869
[ENERU laughs]
That's no way to treat your host

289
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,121
now is it, Shandorian Warrior!

290
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:36,207
I thought that you'd be happy.

291
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,293
After all, it was I
who brought you here

292
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,712
and returned you
to your homeland.

293
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:41,629
[WYPER growls]

294
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,131
[ENERU]
Don't get so worked up.

295
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,216
There's time for that later.

296
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,885
This is the beginning.

297
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,471
You don't want the fun
to end so soon, do you?

298
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,389
This is a game to you?

299
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:52,307
Yes.

300
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,517
And a truly petty game at that.

301
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:57,645
For all of you will be
competing against each other

302
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,314
for my entertainment.

303
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,066
[WYPER growls]

304
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:20,043
Well done. I'm happy so many
of you've made it this far.

305
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:23,046
I extend my welcome
to you survivors.

306
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:26,383
[ENERU laughing]

307
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,137
[laughs]

308
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:33,890
[ENERU]
And now the fun truly begins.

309
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:36,393
This is a survival game
to see how many people

310
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,562
out of an original 81,
including myself,

311
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:42,982
are still standing after
three hours on this island.

312
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,111
The last person left will
of course be the winner.

313
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:49,239
Among you are a few participants
who entered late into the game,

314
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:51,700
but I've decided to
allow them to stay.

315
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,411
It will make it all
the more interesting.

316
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,329
Now the five of us
will continue on

317
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:58,707
in the final stage of the game.

318
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,585
[NAMI]
Did he say five people?

319
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:06,756
Zoro, Robin, Gan Fall,
Bazooka man, and Eneru.

320
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,300
That's exactly five people.

321
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,470
Phew. Good thing he hasn't
noticed that I'm here.

322
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:17,017
[ENERU] In just a few minutes
the three hours will be up.

323
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,311
Which means that the six
people we have present here

324
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,355
are one too many.

325
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,232
[NAMI]
He knows I'm here.

326
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,735
The one thing I know
is that God's prophecy

327
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,572
will never falter,
because he is absolute.

328
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,700
I'm curious to see how this
person is going to die.

329
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:35,326
Will you all fight each other?

330
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,038
Will you gang up on one
of the weaker ones?

331
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:43,209
Of course, you could all resist
your fates and force me to pick.

332
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:53,762
What do you want to do, Robin?

333
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,805
I'm not going to kill anyone.

334
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:57,057
I won't either.

335
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,517
I won't compete
in your sick game.

336
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:03,646
And I too refuse to take part.

337
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,231
[yelps]

338
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,400
Why do you gotta
drag me into this?!

342
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,502
[ENERU]
Insolent fools.

<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

345

<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

348
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:48,900
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

349
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,986
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

350
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

351
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,245
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

352
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

353
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

354
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,544
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

355
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,462
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

356
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,215
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

357
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,633
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

358
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

359
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:19,347
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

360
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,182
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

361
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,020
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

362
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,189
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

363
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,164
[LUFFY]
What's gonna happen to us?

364
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,999
[NAMI] I don't know,
but that guy's dangerous.

365
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:49,002
[ENERU] Only survivors are
allowed to come with me.

366
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:51,004
[ZORO] I think you're
messed up in the head.

367
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,173
[GAN FALL] I won't let you
have your way, Eneru!

368
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,966
[ENERU]
Now let's set off, shall we?

369
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,260
To the Endless Vearth.

370
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:59,220
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

371
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,641
"Showdown in the Ancient Ruins!
Sky God Eneru's Goal!"

372
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:06,269
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
