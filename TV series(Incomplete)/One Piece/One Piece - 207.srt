00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,447
So we've gotta be in the
next island's climate zone.

175
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,921
You hear that,
Robin? Any islands?

176
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,359
We've been approaching
one for a while now.

177
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:38,296
[USOPP] Why didn't you tell us?!
[LUFFY] Why didn't you tell us?!

178
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,300
You are way too secretive! Look!

179
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,505
Maybe tell us next
time you see an island!

180
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,108
You know, like this!

181
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:50,253
Land ahoy! Land!
I see land! Yea! Yea!

182
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:51,389
Now you say it!

183
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:53,092
The fog looks pretty thick.

184
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,063
Don't ignore me!

185
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,535
Heavy fog? That's not good.

186
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,240
Hey Chopper, I need you
to stand forward watch!

187
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,242
[CHOPPER]
Right!

188
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,379
[LUFFY] Robin! Do you
have any idea how long

189
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,450
we've been waiting
to see another island?

190
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,154
[ROBIN] Sorry,
won't happen again.

191
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,526
[LUFFY] Well, as long
as you mean it. Okay.

192
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,565
You know, I can't stop
thinking about that ship.

193
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:15,938
They didn't have a captain
or a navigator or even sails!

194
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:18,276
It was like they had no
idea what they were doing!

195
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,313
Now what kind of
self-respecting pirates

196
00:12:20,346 --> 00:12:21,950
would head out to sea like that?

197
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:24,054
I'm guessing they
got in a battle and lost.

198
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:27,194
Captain probably got killed and
then their ship got plundered.

199
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:28,831
But that can't be it.

200
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:31,570
I got a look at their ship.
It was in perfect condition.

201
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:35,076
No signs of battle but it was
still completely stripped clean

202
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:37,515
of anything a pirate
would need to survive.

203
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:42,224
They probably weren't
even pirates then. Forget it.

204
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:43,894
Hmmm... They looked
like pirates to me.

205
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:47,034
Crummy pirates,
but still, I don't know.

206
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,271
I got a bad feeling
about this somehow.

207
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,508
[SANJI] Have you
ever had a good one?

208
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,945
[LUFFY] Anyway!
I wonder if there's a town.

209
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:53,880
I hope they've got a shipyard.

210
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,819
[NAMI] Luffy! Don't
jump off right away!

211
00:13:01,395 --> 00:13:02,230
I hope we can find

212
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,036
a knowledgeable
shipwright to join us.

213
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:06,472
Get the anchor ready!

214
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:09,445
We're near the shore!

215
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,215
That feeling just got worse.

216
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,852
[SANJI] Hey, Chopper,
Usopp's come down

217
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:15,591
with another bout
of "Scaredy-Cat-itis."

218
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:17,294
Well, there's
no cure for that.

219
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,431
[LUFFY] Alright,
let's go, let's go!

220
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,544
Hmm?

221
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,246
You're kidding.

222
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:31,188
[LUFFY] There's nothing at all!

223
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,994
It's like a blank slate! Cool!

224
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,599
All I can see is
grass and trees!

225
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:41,409
Man, this place is
kind of depressing.

226
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,914
I wonder if anyone
actually lives here.

227
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:45,116
[LUFFY] Yahoo!

228
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:45,918
[NAMI] Hey!

229
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,387
[CHOPPER] Me too!

230
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:56,940
Jeez, it's like they have no
concept of unknown danger.

231
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:58,409
You can see clear
across the island

232
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,514
and there's no threat in sight.

233
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,231
[startled shriek]

234
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,201
You see something, Chopper?

235
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:18,617
[thinking]
Human?

236
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,455
Have you ever seen a
human this furry and enormous?

237
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:23,960
It's got to be
some kind of bear!

238
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,371
[USOPP] Whoa, it's so
long! It's a long bear!

239
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,609
[CHOPPER] I'm
getting dizzy up here!

240
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,555
Hey! Check out how
long this apple is!

241
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,290
Whoa!

242
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:44,267
I'm just realizing it, but
the trees are long too!

243
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,080
Hmm...

244
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:52,918
Hey, look! Is that
a house over there?

245
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:56,491
Yeah, I guess it
looks like a house.

246
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,264
Let's go check it out.

247
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,013
Are you guys related?

248
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:09,384
That's a deer
and I'm a reindeer!

249
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,622
Shake!

250
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:30,059
Hey, Chopper! Watch this.

251
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,740
Go for it, Usopp!

252
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,175
[LUFFY] Down.

253
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,181
Now, beg!

254
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:48,196
It's miles long!

255
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:51,401
[USOPP] Wow! I can't
even see its head!

256
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:56,612
Huh?

257
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:02,490
[ZORO] Where the hell
did they run off to?

258
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,529
[NAMI] They were right
there just a minute ago.

259
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:06,198
[SANJI] We might
as well disembark.

260
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,102
There's got to be
food on this island.

261
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:13,179
Hey, earth to Robin!
We're gonna jump ship, okay?

262
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,515
Right.

263
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:18,590
[USOPP] Everything on
this island is so long.

264
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:23,032
How'd it get this way?
Maybe it's the gravity?

265
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,602
[CHOPPER] My body
feels all stretched out

266
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:27,274
just from thinking about it.

267
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:31,348
[USOPP] And what is the
point of a place like this?

268
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,419
[LUFFY]
Hello? Anyone home?

269
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,789
[USOPP] What do you
think you're doing?!

270
00:16:34,822 --> 00:16:36,225
You can't go in there!

271
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:37,795
For all we know,
the boss of the island

272
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,231
lives in this house
and he's probably

273
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,668
some terrifyingly
long man-snake monster

274
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,538
that'll swallow us whole!

275
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:45,309
It's empty. No one's home.

276
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:49,786
[CHOPPER] Hey, Luffy! Usopp!
There's a giraffe out here!

277
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,254
--Really?!
--Really?!

278
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,764
[neighing]

279
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:58,804
Chopper that's not a giraffe.

280
00:16:58,837 --> 00:17:02,110
It's just a horse with a
long neck. A long horse.

281
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:04,180
You're a horse?

282
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,286
Wow, what a pretty horse!

283
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:10,493
She said thank you
and her name is Shelly.

284
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,364
Going by the saddle
she's got on her,

285
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,467
her owner must be close by.

286
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:17,608
Hey what are you looking at?

287
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:18,676
Over there.

288
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,516
There's something up with
those two bamboo trees.

289
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,223
[USOPP] Huh? Yeah, you're
right, talk about tall!

290
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:27,093
I can't even see the top!

291
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,431
That's not it look closer.

292
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:32,237
Huh? AHHHH!

293
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,141
They're moving!

294
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:38,215
Huh? They must be part
of some long animal!

295
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:42,692
That thing's attacking
Luffy! Are you okay?!

296
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,696
Get back here, bamboo!

297
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,432
Be careful, Luffy!

298
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,538
Gum-Gum whip!

299
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:56,720
Alright! You did it!

300
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:59,324
Yeah! I beat it!

301
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,829
Why are you alone?
Where's your owner?

302
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,902
You don't know where?

303
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:07,239
That sounds awfully lonely.

304
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,816
[loud crash]

305
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:17,293
It might be bad guys!
Stay there and hide!

306
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:19,766
What's going on?!

307
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,774
Well, uh. I think
that bamboo tree

308
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,780
was possessed by this spirit.

309
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,283
[blast then whistling sound]

310
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:32,290
[blast then whistling sound]

311
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,660
Huh?

312
00:18:37,835 --> 00:18:41,175
[SANJI] Hey, what's the deal?
They blocked in our ship.

313
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,212
This can't be good.

314
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,951
[thinking]
That's the ship I saw earlier.

315
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:48,422
You looking for a fight?

316
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,560
Cause we'll be happy
to give you one.

317
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,867
[FOXY CREW 208A] We are the
notorious Foxy Pirates!

318
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,171
We want more than
just a fight from you.

319
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,408
We want a showdown!

320
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:01,415
[CHOPPER]
A spirit?

321
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:05,591
[LUFFY] Well, yeah what
else pops out of a tree?

322
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:08,195
[USOPP]
Hey, can you speak?

323
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,870
Quit acting like
I don't remember you,

324
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:13,272
of course I do!

325
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,844
What've you been up
to all these years?

326
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:17,915
Huh? You guys know him?

327
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,984
Never seen him.

328
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:20,521
Same here.

329
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:21,990
[TONJIT] Ah, Well
that would explain why

330
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:23,927
I don't remember you then.

331
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,766
Who are you, old man?
And tell us the truth!

332
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:31,776
If you want my
name, it's Tonjit.

333
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,615
But what I intend to
give you is my gratitude.

334
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:35,984
I've been hoping
someone would

335
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,755
knock me down
off of those stilts.

336
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:41,228
Off what? Uh...

337
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,767
Oh! They are stilts.

338
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,739
We didn't realize
cause they were so long.

339
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,476
We couldn't even see you.

340
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,411
[TONJIT] I'm not surprised.

341
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,850
I couldn't even see
the ground up there.

342
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,321
So then, just to
get this straight,

343
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,958
you're not a
bamboo tree spirit.

344
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,460
You're just an
old guy whose stilts

345
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:59,565
I happened to think
were attacking me.

346
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,571
What were you doing walking
around on those stilts anyway?

347
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:05,309
Well, I've always
been a stilt enthusiast

348
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:06,946
so I decided to
break some records

349
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,817
and make the
world's longest stilts

350
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,355
by using the
bamboo on this island.

351
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,660
I managed to get on
them with a little effort,

352
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,964
but then I was too
scared to climb down!

353
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,400
That's just plain crazy!

354
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,539
I was up there ten years.

355
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,543
Really crazy!

356
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:22,645
Wait, you were up
there on those stilts

357
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:24,014
for ten whole years?!

358
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,984
That's right and to
make matters worse,

359
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,924
the bamboo kept
growing the entire time.

360
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:32,765
It just kept getting harder
and harder to climb down.

361
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,036
So terrifying.

362
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,508
How'd you live up
there for ten years?!

363
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,812
[TONJIT] Well most of
the trees on this island

364
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:42,551
are just as tall as
my stilts, if not taller,

365
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:44,822
so I was well fed
from their fruit.

366
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:46,960
He talks about it
like it was no big deal,

367
00:20:46,993 --> 00:20:48,697
ten long years of his life.

368
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,601
And speaking of
stuff that's long.

369
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:51,803
How come every
living creature

370
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,441
on this island is
so insanely long?

371
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:56,411
It might seem
crazy to an outsider

372
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:57,748
but there is a reason.

373
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:58,984
As I'm sure you've noticed,

374
00:20:59,017 --> 00:21:01,656
the island is nothing
but grass and trees.

375
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:03,760
It's dull. So
everything grew long

376
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,731
out of a longing
for excitement.

377
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,601
[LUFFY thinking]
He can't be serious.

378
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,437
You see that over there?

379
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:13,647
[TONJIT]
Plaaaaaatypus.

380
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,551
[USOPP]
You just said it longer.

381
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,355
[TONJIT] That one is
a daaaaaachshund dog.

382
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:20,326
[CHOPPER] Whoa!
Is that the same dog?

383
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,194
[bark]

384
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:23,499
[USOPP] It's still
passing? Oh, man.

385
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,405
And there are dangerous
animals as well, see?

386
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:30,046
Over there is a snoooooow
leopard I'd steer clear of it.

387
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,081
Huh?

388
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:32,183
[growls]

389
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:35,322
[USOPP] Why is its head
the only thing that's long?

390
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:49,952
[FOXY] Hmmm...
Feh-feh-feh-feh...

391
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:55,697
Hello. We found the captain.

392
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:04,447
♪ ending song ♪

393
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:16,124
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh-feh!

394
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:18,930
My name is Foxy and
I take whatever I want,

395
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:19,999
whenever I want!

396
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,903
[ZORO]
Ah, great, another weirdo.

397
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:23,573
[FOXY] I've come to
challenge you, Straw Hat!

398
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,577
[LUFFY] Are you sure you
wanna do that, split-head?

399
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,612
[FOXY]
What'd you call me?!

400
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,482
[LUFFY]
I accept your challenge!

401
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,219
I'll give you the
fight of your life!

402
00:23:30,252 --> 00:23:33,058
[USOPP] Slow down, Luffy!
Don't just agree like that!

403
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,862
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

404
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:37,100
"A Davy Back with
the Foxy Pirates!"

405
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:40,005
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
