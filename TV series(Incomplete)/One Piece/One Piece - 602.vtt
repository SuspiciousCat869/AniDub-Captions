00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.530
But first thing,

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.201
I gotta save my crew
and get 'em off this island.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:05.271
Or I'll never be able
to die in peace.

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.406
[BROWNBEARD laughing]

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.908
Hey, now, take it easy.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:14.313
I gotta get to the lab.

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.782
That's where he's got
my crew workin' for him.

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:19.518
Not so fast.
You're still badly injured.

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.387
Hey, we're goin'
to the same place!

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.454
[NAMI (SANJI)]
Huh?

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.390
I'm sure that jerk's got
the kids locked up by now,

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:28.761
but we're gonna save 'em
for real this time.

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.529
Considering that,
let me pose a logical

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:31.997
proposition for you.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.933
Let's team up and
take down that gas bastard.

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:35.267
[NAMI (SANJI)]
Hey, what's that smoke?

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.476
[USOPP]
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.145
That is a ton of smoke.

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:48.781
You guys ever seen
purple smoke before?

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.215
Looks like poison gas.

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.651
[USOPP, NAMI (SANJI)]
Huh? Poison gas?!

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:57.756
It's headed right for us!

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.458
No, no, no, what do we do?

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:00.826
[NAMI (SANJI)]
How the hell should I know?!

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.361
Why don't you
come up with an idea?

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:05.297
[USOPP] Seriously? My idea
was to ask you what to do!

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.265
Now start thinking or--

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.267
[BROWNBEARD]
Climb up on my back, you two.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.301
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.838
[GROUP]
Run!

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:15.174
For your life!

00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:18.911
[yelling]

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.880
Aw, crap!
It's about to catch up to us!

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:25.517
If you fall behind,
we'll have to leave you!

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.186
Slow down and
you're good as dead!

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.455
[BROOK whining]

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.623
[KIN'EMON yells]

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:33.392
[ALL yell]

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:36.228
[BROOK] Zoro!
There's no way we can outrun it!

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.665
[ALL yell]

00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:47.873
[KIN'EMON] It's overtaking us!
We'll perish!

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.641
Run faster than the damn wind!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.710
Let's go!

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:54.179
[ALL yell]

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.624
[KIN'EMON] Did we succeed
in outrunning it at all?

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.292
[ZORO] Don't turn around to
check, just keep running

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.727
at full speed!

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:10.229
[BROOK yells]

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:11.730
[SANJI (NAMI)] Our legs
are gonna give out on us

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:12.798
if we keep this up!

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:17.169
[yelling]

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.538
There's some kind of
large animal up ahead!

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.774
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Looks like a giant lizard!

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:23.542
No, it's...

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.213
[ZORO]
It's a dragon!

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.415
[BROOK, SANJI (NAMI)]
A dragon?!

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:30.616
[KIN'EMON]
So it would appear!

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:31.817
[SANJI]
Don't gimme that crap!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.152
Dragons are from fairy tales!

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.853
[ZORO] They're real enough
on this island!

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.589
But this one looks smaller
than the other one I saw!

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:38.590
Holy crap!

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:41.093
We can fly on the damn
thing if we catch it!

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.694
[BROOK]
That's a brilliant idea!

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.329
[SANJI (NAMI)] Then let's do it!
And do it fast!

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:45.931
I can't keep runnin' like this!

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:49.201
Wait up, you fairy tale bastard!

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.375
Hey, that's Zoro!

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.943
They're all runnin'
from the smoke!

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:00.712
[ALL yell]

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.682
Would ya look at those fools?
What're they doin' out there?

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:06.385
And what the hell kind
of stupid run is that?

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:09.922
Oh, look, the samurai
got his whole body back.

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.156
Yeah, you're right!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.692
Guess that means he's
not gonna give me his legs.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.195
Hey, wait, that's not
important right now, Robin!

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:18.764
Run faster, guys!

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.399
That smoke'll freeze you dead!

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.733
You gotta ru--

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:27.539
Oh, man. I don't have
the strength to yell.

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:29.975
Dammit. Dumb Sea Prism Stone.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.378
[CAESAR CLOWN] I take it
those are friends of yours,

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:35.481
Straw Hat Luffy?

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:36.648
Shurorororo!

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.750
Well that does help to
explain why they're so

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.219
difficult to kill.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.121
Shurorororo!

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:44.056
But their lungs
will soon give out

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:46.758
and the gas will overtake them.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.528
Shurororororo!

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.563
In a mere matter of minutes now,

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:55.467
this island will truly become
a Land of the Dead!

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.739
Nothing can survive
outside of these walls.

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:04.042
Not one single soul
will be left alive.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.445
Shurororororo!

00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:09.715
Oh, by the way...

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.316
That includes you, too!

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.254
What's happening?

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.656
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurororororo!

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:20.526
Shurororororo!

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.064
[LUFFY yells]

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:29.034
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurororororo!

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.035
And now,

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:32.504
I offer you all
as proof to the world!

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:34.740
Evidence of the true
destructive power

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.608
of my Land of the Dead!

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:39.611
A pirate worth 400
million berries.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:42.614
A Vice-Admiral of the Navy.

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.051
And even a dreaded
Warlord of the Sea.

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:52.457
You're all completely helpless
against my genius tide of death!

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:57.196
Shurororororo!
Shurororororo!

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.868
[CHOPPER]
What do I do? Think!

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.469
I've gotta do something
or he's gonna kill

00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:06.338
all my friends!

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:08.040
But how can I help?

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:11.410
With these injuries,
I'll only get myself captured.

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.679
And if that happens,
the drug formula

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:17.983
and sedatives I found--
it'll all be for nothing!

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:19.017
Oh, no!

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.719
I just don't know what to do!

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.355
[grunts]

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.327
[CHOPPER yelps]

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.330
I really don't need
any more close calls today!

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:32.764
Wait, what is this?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.502
[CHOPPER]]
"Don't do anything?"

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:38.937
Who threw this?

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.311
Hey, up there! A cage!

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:51.016
Whoa, look who's inside!

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:53.185
--[MARINE F] It's Smokey!
--[MARINE G] And Tashigi!

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:55.520
[MARINE H] Thank goodness,
they're still alive!

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:56.955
Uh... Hang on.

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:58.590
They're all wrapped in chains!

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:01.226
[MARINE I] Dammit!
We really are all gonna die!

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.895
[MARINE G]
Smokey! Tashigi!

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:04.963
Guys!

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:06.431
[MARINES yelling]

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.901
[yelling continues]

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.250
[FRANKY]
So, y'know, I've gotta say.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.989
They really built that lab
as solid as a fortress.

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:33.792
[ROBIN]
Very true.

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.862
And rather well-designed
for maneuvering

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.231
heavy equipment.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.300
How can you two be so relaxed?

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:45.203
[LUFFY] Hmm. So, how're we
gettin' outta this jam?

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:49.308
[LAW] I wasn't expecting
Vergo to show up.

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.642
But no matter.

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.413
I'm not gonna let
a small detail like that

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.982
hold us back now, Straw Hat.

00:21:57.015 --> 00:21:59.151
We're stickin' with the plan.

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:00.686
Just don't screw it up again.

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:04.790
Time for the counterattack.

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:08.460
Right!

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.670
[NARRATOR]
All across the New World,

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:21.006
people watch keenly as the
fearsome weapon

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:23.842
Land of the Dead closes
in on Luffy's group.

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.345
And just when it seems our
hero's luck has run out

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:30.248
for good, Law sets a surprise
plan into motion that's sure

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:32.317
to turn the tables
in their favor.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.919
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:37.823
"Launching the Counterattack!
Luffy and Law's Great Escape!"

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:40.592
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
