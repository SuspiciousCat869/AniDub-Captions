1
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,624
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,361
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,962
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,965
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,499
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,269
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,938
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,974
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,743
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,379
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,980
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,917
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,720
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:10,057
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,260
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:18,031
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,903
[NARRATOR]
The battle of Marineford

18
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,805
ended with a Navy victory.

19
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,640
Unable to save Ace's life,

20
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,443
the injured Luffy was
taken to Amazon Lily,

21
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,611
where he fell into despair.

22
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,449
[NARRATOR] But this is a
story from another time.

23
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,586
Ten years ago, in the East
Blue, the brothers ran wild

24
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,554
with dreams of a world
full of adventure,

25
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,723
as well as the pirate flags
they would someday fly.

26
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,361
[NARRATOR]
Tucked away in Mount Corvo,

27
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,863
with Dadan and her
mountain bandits,

28
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,165
Ace and Luffy took
a vow of brotherhood

29
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,235
with their friend and
co-conspirator, Sabo.

30
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,570
[ACE]
We'll always be brothers

31
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,072
and nobody can take that away.

32
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:04,077
Heh. From now on, we're
honest to goodness brothers.

33
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,712
Cheers to that!

34
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,585
[ALL]
Brothers!

35
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,287
Too bad I'm gonna
become a pirate

36
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,988
and recruit the best
cook before you do.

37
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,156
Yeah, you wish!

38
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,192
I'm gonna be a pirate
before either of you dopes!

39
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,062
[GARP clears throat]

40
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,265
You little bastards are still
spouting that pirate crap?

41
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,102
You're both gonna be
Marines someday,

42
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,638
even if I gotta beat
some dignity into you!

43
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,572
[BOTH groan]

44
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,608
[DADAN]
"We will stand on our feet."

45
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:37,010
[screams]

46
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,914
Now this is how you live!

47
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,516
Uh-huh, no kidding.

48
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:46,519
[LUFFY giggles]
What an awesome hideout!

49
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,856
So, that's where they are?

50
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,028
[LUFFY]
"Luffy Becoming an Apprentice?!

51
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,198
A Man Who Fought Against
the King of the Pirates!"

52
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,670
[NARRATOR] Seasons came and
went, giving way to winter.

53
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,542
[ACE]
Sabo! He's coming at you!

54
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,809
Don't let him escape!

55
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,579
[SABO]
No problem! I got this!

56
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,451
Good! He's running
straight for the bay!

57
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,027
[giggles]

58
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,228
Okay, Luffy! You're up!

59
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,800
Hello, food.

60
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:38,171
[LUFFY yells, groans]

61
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,773
[BEAR A gasps]

62
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:44,011
[BOTH chuckle, gasp]

63
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:46,346
You can't get away!

64
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:57,391
[panting]

65
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:02,596
[BEAR A groaning]

66
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,601
[panting]

67
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,970
I got him! You see that?

68
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,139
Ha, ha. Wow, nice one, Luffy.

69
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,474
All right, that's
two in one day.

70
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,111
We're gonna have a ton
of danpa soup tonight!

71
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:17,778
Uh-huh!

72
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,282
I did it! [laughs]

73
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,617
I can hunt, too! Yay!

74
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,118
Uh, hey, Luffy?

75
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,420
[TIGER A growls]

76
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,222
Behind you! Look out!

77
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,624
Huh? Behind me?

78
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,399
Whoa, he's big!

79
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,270
[ACE] He must've smelled our
dinner and came running.

80
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,372
[SABO]
He just wants the danpa, Luffy!

81
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,773
Get away from there!

82
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,441
[TIGER A growls]

83
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,177
[LUFFY gasping]

84
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,452
I've never hunted
anything so big.

85
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,487
This one is special to me!

86
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,323
So, go get your own food!

87
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,525
[SABO] Luffy, cut it out,
he's way too tough!

88
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,893
We can get another one!

89
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,161
[LUFFY]
No! I said this one is special!

90
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,162
Get away, cat!

91
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,298
I'm gonna bonk you!

92
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,234
[LUFFY gasps, groans]

93
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,202
That looks bad.

94
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:15,969
You okay?

95
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,339
[LUFFY]
I'll show you!

96
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,307
Gum-Gum...!

97
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,011
[LUFFY gasps, groans]

98
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,184
[LUFFY yelling]

99
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,424
[LUFFY]
Round two.

100
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,525
Now, Gum-Gum...

101
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,360
[SABO, ACE]
No, you don't!

102
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,529
Hurry! Hurry!

103
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,997
While he's busy!

104
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,165
[SABO]
I know!

105
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,834
[LUFFY]
I'll get you next time!

106
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,315
[sighs]

107
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,118
[SABO] Sorry. I know that was
your first big kill and all.

108
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,352
[ACE]
He'll get over it.

109
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,721
Which is something we
couldn't say if he got eaten.

110
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,322
[LUFFY]
Yeah, but that tiger cheated!

111
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,092
He can't steal from me!
I gotta teach him a lesson!

112
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,694
[ACE]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

113
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,396
If you wanna die that bad,
don't take us with you!

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,265
Huh?

115
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,635
[LUFFY laughing]

116
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,236
[SABO]
C'mon! That's not funny!

117
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,504
[ACE]
Luffy!

118
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,909
[LUFFY gasps, screams]

119
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,017
[SABO grunting]

120
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,055
[ACE grunting]

121
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,260
Hurry! Pull!

122
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,461
He's slipping!

123
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,162
Okay.

124
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,766
[LUFFY giggles]
Sorry!

125
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,603
[SABO groans]
Well, today sucked.

126
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,772
Let's go to bed and hope
tomorrow is better.

127
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,775
[LUFFY] You mean going to
"bed" makes it "bedder"?

128
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,710
[LUFFY chuckles]

129
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,011
[LUFFY]
Ugh. I'm hungry.

130
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,312
[ACE]
Who's fault is that?

131
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,580
--[thud]
--[LUFFY] Ow!

132
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,483
[SABO]
The bridge thing was stupid,

133
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,052
but I don't blame
Luffy for being mad

134
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:12,853
about losing his catch.

135
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,722
He did pretty good
out there today.

136
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,690
Yeah. Except for the
part where he almost

137
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,591
got eaten by a giant tiger.

138
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,093
Oh, you would do the same thing!

139
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,828
Whatever! Good night!

140
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:25,666
[SABO, ACE yawn]

141
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,736
[LUFFY yawns]

142
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,817
[LUFFY giggles]

143
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,521
Having big brothers
sure is cool.

144
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:50,390
I hope they'll join
my pirate crew someday.

145
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,798
[ACE] Don't waste your time
on these guys, Captain.

146
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,667
[SABO]
Yeah, we got this one.

147
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:01,935
[LUFFY]
I may be the captain,

148
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,737
but we're still brothers!

149
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:07,007
[ALL yell]

150
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,310
[LUFFY giggling]
Awesome.

151
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,413
This had better be
a really good joke.

152
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,116
I'd rather have something
to eat, but let's hear it.

153
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:17,351
I'm happy, that's all.

154
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,685
I made up my mind!

155
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,420
You guys are joining my crew!

156
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,856
'Kay? Promise?

157
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,390
I'm not promising anything!

158
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,892
Shut up and go back to sleep.

159
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,827
I said we'd figure it
out later, didn't I?

160
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,896
Aw! Come on!

161
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,298
It'll be way more fun
if we're together.

162
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,300
And you guys need
my help, you know.

163
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,367
You do!

164
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,203
Uh, yeah, you're the one
who needs help, buddy.

165
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,872
Also, stop bobbing like that.

166
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:38,738
It's weird.

167
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,340
[LUFFY]
You're not listening!

168
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,875
We gotta be a crew, we gotta!

169
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,944
Okay, I get it,
we make a good team.

170
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,780
Let's work together,
but I'm the captain.

171
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,281
[BOTH]
No, it's my ship!

172
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,149
I see. Well, that's too bad.

173
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,250
We're back to square one.

174
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,252
You sure you can't budge?

175
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,253
[ACE]
Yep.

176
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,555
What about you?

177
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,291
I wanna be free--I'm not gonna
serve as somebody's lackey.

178
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,425
Sorry.

179
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,794
[LUFFY]
Come on! It'll be fun!

180
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,363
Oh, wait, I know!

181
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,932
Let's go fight that
big 'ole tiger

182
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,935
and whoever beats it
gets to be captain.

183
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,136
Screw "captain."

184
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,838
We'll all be tiger food.

185
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:13,106
Even if we could beat that
thing--which we can't--

186
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,175
the chances of you
doing it are, like, zero.

187
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,977
Yeah, if I fought it by myself.

188
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,478
That's why we'll
fight it as a team

189
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,915
and just see who
lands the final hit!

190
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,817
[ACE, SABO]
Now that's a plan!

191
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,819
You guys are goin' down!

192
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,519
[ACE, SABO]
Yeah, right!

193
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,361
[ACE]
Everyone ready?

194
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,165
Uh-huh.

195
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,767
These were hard to catch.

196
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,535
This is a waste of fish.

197
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,036
You knew they were bait.

198
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,038
We gotta think bigger if
we wanna fight a monster

199
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,340
like that tiger.

200
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,010
[BEAR B roars]

201
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,878
[SABO gasps]
It sounds like he's on his way.

202
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,615
You greedy jerk--I'm beating
you and I'm keeping my fish!

203
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,984

[BEAR B growls]

206
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:03,490
Let's do it.

207
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,560
[BEAR B roars]

208
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,095
[SABO]
Oh, oops.

209
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,863
That's not a tiger.

210
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,232
[LUFFY, ACE]
Huh?

211
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,933
[roars]

212
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,437
So now what?
Do we fight him instead?

213
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,806
We didn't invite you,
bear, go away!

214
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,973
Shoo! Go on!

215
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,375
[BEAR B growls]

216
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,379
Actually, this guy might be
nearly as strong as the tiger.

217
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,047
Either way, if we
can't beat him,

218
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,849
we can't beat our kitty friend.

219
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,384
All right then, let's see
if big, hairy, and ugly

220
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,788
makes for a good warm-up.

221
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,556
[ACE] Keep yappin',
I'm gonna beat him!

222
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,024
[SABO]
Hey, no fair!

223
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,158
[LUFFY]
You big cheater!

He's not gonna stop
chasing us, is he?

00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,296
[LUFFY, ACE, SABO panting]

235
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,166

Whoa. Who's that guy?

240
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,432
Better move, whoever he is.

241
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:55,335
His name's Naguri--I've seen
him around Gray Terminal.

242
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,405
Hey! What're you doing, old man?

243
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,746
You got a death wish? Run!

244
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,847

[gasps]

248
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,806
Leave these boys alone.

249
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,842
It's time to return
to the forest.

250
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,112
I said turn around
and leave us be!

251
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:55,529
[ALL gasp]

252
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,464
He stopped it.

253
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:04,971
Just like Shanks. So cool!

254
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,794
[SABO] What? You used to
be a pirate, Naguri?

255
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,696
And a captain?

256
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,867
Indeed.

257
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,669
Yeah, I knew that already!

258
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,070
I mean, you did
that cool thing--

259
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,673
only a pirate captain
could be that awesome!

260
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:40,874
What "cool thing"?

261
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,843
[LUFFY giggles] You know
what I'm talking about--

262
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,311
you made the bear go away.

263
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,680
And all you had to do
was look at him!

264
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,016
Just like Shanks!

265
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,018
Oh, I see. [chuckles]

266
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,387
He never seemed tough
enough to be a pirate.

267
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,623
Not to me.

268
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,791
He was just weird.

269
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,662
[SABO] 'Course, lots of people
at Gray Terminal are weird,

270
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,131
but this guy would
grab junk all day

271
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:05,933
and then hammer it
together and make--

272
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,368
well, I don't even know what.

273
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,437
The other guys or Bluejam's
crew would pick on him,

274
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,506
but he'd just sit
there and take it.

275
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,475
Never fought back
or said a word.

276
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,811
Seemed pretty pathetic
if you ask me.

277
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,412
Shows what you know, dummy.

278
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,714
All captains are like that!

279
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,416
Now you're just making stuff up!

280
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,952
Since when are you
the pirate expert, huh?

281
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:29,823
Captains don't get worked up
over losers--Shanks told me!

282
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,458
It's always "Shanks" with you.

283
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,361
Hey, here, eat.

284
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,697
[LUFFY, SABO gasp]
Ow, ow, ow!

285
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,999
Hey, you gave him more than me!

286
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,468
[SABO]
Better luck next time, shrimp.

287
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,074
Hey, don't hold back, Naguri--
you did save our lives.

288
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,310
Thank you. But it
was no trouble.

289
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,079
So... You're obviously
no pushover.

290
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,316
What are you doing in a
dump like Gray Terminal?

291
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,519
[NAGURI]
Hmm.

292
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,088
It's hardly a charming story.

293
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,956
Well, if you don't want
to talk about it,

294
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,859
it's not like I can force you.

295
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,494
[NAGURI]
No. I don't mind.

296
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,798
I assume you know the
famous pirate, Gold Roger?

297
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,399
[ACE gasps]

298
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,634
Uh-huh?

299
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,403
'Course I know! He was the king!

300
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,405
My men, at the height
of our strength,

301
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,241
challenged Roger to a fight.

302
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,175
Really?

303
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,710
A fight that we lost.

304
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,346
Put in our place,
we all split up.

305
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,417
[NAGURI] Everything went
downhill after that.

306
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,522
One thing led to
another, and here I am.

307
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,123
Frankly, it makes me wonder

308
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,192
if I was worth
anything to begin with.

309
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,996
You fought the King of the
Pirates--that means you're cool!

310
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,398
Win or lose!

311
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:45,933
Well, I'm not so sure.

312
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:47,634
We got beaten pretty badly,

313
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:52,506
and at any rate, we certainly
didn't feel very "cool." So...

314
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,974
Oh, really?

315
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,310
So Gold Roger was
as tough as they say?

316
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:58,779
Or tougher, even?

317
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:01,648
Yes. But one man alone
can only be so strong--

318
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,885
it was his crew that made
him truly unstoppable.

319
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,854
Or rather,
it was their teamwork,

320
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,857
their comradery
that impressed me.

321
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,794
It was an honor to
see them in action.

322
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,061
[SABO gasps]

323
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,169
[LUFFY] Aw, man. I guess I
still got a long way to go

324
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,737
before I'm tough like that.

325
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:27,107
Is that so? You planning on
being a pirate someday?

326
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,542
I sure am!

327
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,544
And a captain? Like me?

328
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,379
[LUFFY]
Mm-hm! And the king!

329
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,114
Oh, wait, you can help me!

330
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:35,949
Do you have any
good pirating tips?

331
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:36,783
[NAGURI]
Hm?

332
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,953
How do I get super strong?

333
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:42,423
I gotta beat Ace and Sabo
so I can be captain.

334
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:43,690
Is that how it works?

335
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,092
Uh-huh, sure is!

336
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,360
So, can you train me?

337
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,229
Well, all right.

338
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,497
Really?

339
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,498
[LUFFY]
Heh. That's great!

340
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,601
I'll start my
training tomorrow!

341
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,837
[SABO sighs]

342
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,305
[LUFFY]
Where did Ace go?

343
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,740
[SABO]
Uh, yeah, about that.

344
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,177
[LUFFY]
What?!

345
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,714
Gold Roger is Ace's dad
and he never told me?

346
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,482
[SABO]
Yeah, well, it's a big secret.

347
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,050
So, keep it that way.

348
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,053
And while you're at it,
don't mention it to Ace, either.

349
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:14,488
He'll kill the both of us.

350
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,922
[LUFFY]
I don't get it.

351
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:19,894
It's a mystery to me, too,
but I do know he hates Roger.

352
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,229
Why? I mean, that's his dad.

353
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,132
Doesn't mean he has to
like him, does it?

354
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,333
[gasps]

355
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,303
[SABO] I know you guys
still have it worse,

356
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,273
but even if I did have parents,
I was still all alone.

357
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,275
Sorry, I guess you're right.

358
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,178
Family or not, I guess
some people in this world

359
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,513
just aren't meant to get along.

360
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,015
[LUFFY]
Yeah, but most people don't have

361
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,216
the King of the Pirates
as their dad.

362
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,185
I know you want to
ask him about Roger,

363
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,421
and to be honest,
I'd love to know, myself,

364
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,922
but just lay off, okay?

365
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,657
Do you promise?

366
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,659
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh! No problem.

367
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,795
Oh, and you, too, Naguri.

368
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:56,730
I won't say a word.

369
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,867
[NAGURI] But to think
that Roger had a son

370
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:04,271
and he was right
here all this time.

371
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:06,006
[SABO]
All right, there he is.

372
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,141
Looks like he calmed down,

373
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,476
but play it cool
just in case, got it?

374
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,344
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

375
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,278
[SABO]
And do not mention Roger--

376
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,079
[LUFFY]
I know! I know, I know!

377
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,517
Hey, Ace, there you are!

378
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,120
Didn't know you
came home already!

379
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,654
Hey, Ace, there you are!

380
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,223
Didn't know Roger was
your dad and you hate him!

381
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,457
[screams]

382
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,493
[SABO]
He didn't last five seconds!

383
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,328
Remember when we were
gonna drown you?

384
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,998
'Cause I'm kinda regretting
that we didn't right now!

385
00:20:31,031 --> 00:20:32,066
Luffy.

386
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,434
Yeah?

387
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:35,703
Who told you all that?

388
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,471
U-Uh...

389
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,373
Sabo did!

390
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,676
So, tell me, was Roger
awesome or super awesome?

391
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,511
Stop it! Be cool!

392
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,214
This is the exact opposite
of what I told you to do--

393
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,649
You're gonna get us killed!

394
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:52,586
[BOTH groan]
Ow.

395
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,989
Don't you ever speak that name
in front of me again, got it?

396
00:20:58,358 --> 00:20:59,259
[LUFFY]
Don't be stingy!

397
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,561
I bet you got cool
stories to tell!

398
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,696
[SABO]
You could've let me explain

399
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,464
before you clobbered
me over the head!

400
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,801
That's enough!

401
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,435
There.

402
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,238
[LUFFY] I wanna hear
pirate secrets! Please!

403
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,408
Yeah! We're brothers--we can't
hide things from each other!

404
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,376
Shut up!

405
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:16,810
You're both dead to me!

406
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,145
[LUFFY]
Roger, Roger, Roger!

407
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:19,980
He's your father,
father, father!

408
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:22,683
[SABO] Stop! His anger's
making him stronger!

409
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:24,017
[LUFFY screams]

410
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:25,752
[ACE] This is your fault
for running your mouth

411
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,120
in the first place, Sabo!

412
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:29,456
[SABO]
Ow! He had to learn someday!

413
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,258
[LUFFY]
Stop hitting me!

414
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,799
Let me say it again.

415
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:41,335
From now on,
you bastards're dead to me!

416
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,870
[SABO, LUFFY]
Oh, yeah?

417
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,238
Took the words outta my mouth!

418
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,506
[ALL gasp]

419
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,512
Don't let me down.
I'll be counting on you.

420
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:57,484
[BLUEJAM] Got it.
I'll leave no stone unturned.

421
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,921
Well, you heard the man.

422
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:03,023
[BLUEJAM PIRATE A]
We'll get right on it, boss.

423
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:06,760
Hold on. When you find him,
don't do anything yet.

424
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:07,728
[BLUEJAM PIRATE A]
What?

425
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,196
[BLUEJAM]
The longer we make him wait,

426
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,665
the more gratitude we
can wring out of him.

427
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,435
Money's fine, but I
want a favor, too.

428
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:17,938
He can wait for his
dear Sabo a bit longer.

429
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,340
I see.

430
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:20,507
[BLUEJAM]
Keep an eye on him,

431
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:24,311
but until I give you the order,
don't snatch him up.

432
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:27,814
[DADAN] "We will have
a visit this spring."

433
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,917
Dogra! Magra!

434
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,986
What is Goa? A country?

435
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,821
[DOGRA] Uh, that's
the country we live in.

436
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,658
Mount Corvo, Windmill
Village, and Gray Terminal

437
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,193
are all part of Goa.

438
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:40,694
[DADAN]
Hmph. I knew that.

439
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,829
It must be the end of the world.

440
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,631
I wasn't even sure
you could read

441
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:46,266
and now you're
reading the paper?

442
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,235
Frankly, it's kinda
creeping me out.

443
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,237
--[thud]
--[MAGRA] Ow!

444
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,140
[DADAN] Anyway, they're making
a big deal about this visit,

445
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,176
but it's not like they're
gonna haul their asses

446
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,278
all the way to our mountain.

447
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:01,148
Not that I'd want to see
those pompous bastards anyway.

448
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:03,016
Celestial Dragons?

449
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,517
No thanks.

450
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,828
[NARRATOR]
Ace and Sabo visit Naguri

451
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,864
to see how Luffy is fairing
in his new apprenticeship.

452
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,167
As the three boys compete to
decide who will be captain,

453
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,804
Naguri reminds them that
it takes more than strength

454
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:24,705
to be a leader.

455
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,740
Facing off with a massive tiger,

456
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:29,042
they must find their
answer in battle.

457
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,844
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

458
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,280
"The Battle Against
the Big Tiger!

459
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,484
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
