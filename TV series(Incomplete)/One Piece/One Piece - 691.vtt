must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.865
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.437
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.677
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.581
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:56.086
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.400
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

with his faithful crew.

In order to defeat one of the

Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.501
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.939
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:25.578
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:28.149
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:28.182 --> 00:03:29.987
a barrier known as
the "Birdcage"

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.191
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:34.596
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.136
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.739
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:39.773 --> 00:03:42.177
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.315
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:47.054
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:49.458
Is there any hope...

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.566
...for me to join you?

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.575
For example, you always
wanted to be a pirate, right?

00:03:57.608 --> 00:04:00.113
Me, not so much.

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:02.952
The methods didn't matter.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.862
'Cause the only
thing I care about

How I've missed you!

00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:00.246
[KANJURO]
Wha...?

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.522
[KANJURO]
Oh, Kin'emon!

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:09.230
At long last!
My heart dances!

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:14.274
[KANJURO] My apologies. It seems
I was troublesome to find.

00:14:14.307 --> 00:14:17.715
I encountered one strange
occurrence after another,

00:14:17.748 --> 00:14:18.951
so I thought it might be wise

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.790
to hide in the wall
until danger had passed.

00:14:21.823 --> 00:14:25.163
However, it seems I fell asleep.

00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:27.467
You're truly a
remarkable friend.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.407
I'm grateful that
you came back for me.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.314
[KIN'EMON sniffs]
How could you say that?

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:39.157
[KIN'EMON]
Momonosuke! No!

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.530
[KANJURO]
Spare not a thought for me!

00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:44.668
Just protect Momonosuke!

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:49.210
I kept you waiting-forgive me.

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:53.252
[laughs] There's
no cause for regret.

00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:56.459
I would gladly wait for my
friend as long as it took.

00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:57.728
I trust you.

00:14:57.761 --> 00:14:59.532
[CROWD gasps]

00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:03.172
[KANJURO] Thanks to my sorcery,
I was able to conceal myself.

00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:06.111
I could produce
sustenance as well.

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:11.422
[KANJURO]
Where are my manners?

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:14.461
Perhaps you have not
been as fortunate as I.

00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:15.664
Want some lettuce?

00:15:15.697 --> 00:15:17.234
No, I'm fine.

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.772
Your food never
agrees with my stomach.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:23.179
[KANJURO laughs]

00:15:23.212 --> 00:15:24.783
[KANJURO]
I trust that Momonosuke

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:27.555
is in good health, as well?

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:29.491
Indeed he is. Thanks to you.

00:15:29.526 --> 00:15:33.967
Good news! In that case, I hope
that we can be reunited soon.

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.403
Likewise!

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:38.342
I'm sure Momonosuke will be
eager to see you, as well!

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:39.979
A great many
things have happened

00:15:40.012 --> 00:15:41.817
since the two of us parted ways.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.020
Far too many to explain.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:46.593
Doing so will have to
wait until another time.

00:15:46.627 --> 00:15:48.229
We must make haste.

00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:51.636
Very well, then. Let us depart.

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:55.109
[SOLDIER C] Huh? Does that
mean they know a way out?

00:15:55.143 --> 00:15:57.380
[TOWNSMAN A]
Who are these people?

00:15:57.413 --> 00:16:00.520
[KANJURO yells]

00:16:08.637 --> 00:16:09.873
A painting?

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:11.676
What's that gonna do?

00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:15.517
[KANJURO grunting]

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.735
Now, come forth!

00:16:24.768 --> 00:16:27.641
[CROWD murmurs]

00:16:30.045 --> 00:16:32.651
[KANJURO grunts]

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:36.692
Spring Sparrow!

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:40.834
[CROWD gasps]

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.605
This is weird!

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.307
[BIRD A grunts]

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.680
He must have Devil-Fruit powers!

00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:49.150
It's moving on its own!

00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:54.829
[BIRD A groans]

00:16:54.862 --> 00:16:56.264
[BIRD A squawks]

00:16:56.297 --> 00:17:00.306
[CROWD gasps] That picture
of a bird just came to life!

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:03.478
[CROWD] He's a crappy artist,
though. It looks awful.

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:04.849
[SOLDIER D]
That's an amazing power,

00:17:04.882 --> 00:17:07.588
but he can't draw birds at all!

00:17:07.622 --> 00:17:09.792
Poor thing can barely fly!

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:13.567
[BIRD A grunting]

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.472
[KANJURO]
Now, Kin'emon, away we go!

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:17.942
[KIN'EMON]
Mm.

00:17:17.975 --> 00:17:20.246
[BIRD A groans]

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.660
[KANJURO laughs] This spring
sparrow shall deliver us

00:17:26.693 --> 00:17:27.828
straight to the outside!

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.732
Hold on, you two!

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:30.935
[KANJURO]
Hm?

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:33.773
The people here are
King Riku's soldiers

00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:36.278
and citizens who were once toys.

00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:38.984
We need to know if
King Riku is alive, please!

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:41.088
We're so lost right now!

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:42.423
[KANJURO, KIN'EMON]
Hm.

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.029
Our families are waiting
for us up in the city!

00:17:45.063 --> 00:17:47.100
Is there any way
you can take us?

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:48.135
We're trapped!

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:50.273
What do ya say?

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:53.947
I would be thrilled to help!
One moment, please!

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.082
[CROWD gasps]

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.385
[TOWNSMAN E]
Brilliant!

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:58.122
[TOWNSMAN F]
Thank you, samurai!

00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.761
[SOLDIER H]
We can finally get out of here!

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:02.364
Take turns climbing up!

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:05.570
The ladders are not
particularly sturdy!

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:08.175
We could climb better if
the lines were straight.

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.547
Well, that's just
hurtful. How rude.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.655
[BIRD A gasping]

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.571
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:25.376
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE O]
There's Straw Hat! Fire!

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:27.981
Why don't you try
aiming at us, too?

00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:29.150
Hoo!

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:31.454
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yelling]

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:34.628
[DELLINGER]
Guillotine High-Heel!

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:38.202
[GILLY groans]

00:18:38.236 --> 00:18:40.840
Since you asked so nicely!

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.285
Ah! The Longleg guy got beat!

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:49.091
[CAVENDISH]
Enough! Eyes forward, Straw Hat!

00:18:49.124 --> 00:18:50.661
We have one objective,

00:18:50.694 --> 00:18:53.098
and that's making it to
Doflamingo's palace!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:56.071
The moment that I heard him make
that announcement to everyone,

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:58.876
I realized the bitter truth!

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.819
[DOFLAMINGO] Your objective
is to assassinate me.

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:05.857
It's kill or be killed.

00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:12.003
Every person in the kingdom
is now a bounty hunter.

00:19:12.036 --> 00:19:15.342
And the only way
for you to survive...

00:19:15.376 --> 00:19:19.217
...is for you to take
the life of another person.

00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:21.756
[DOFLAMINGO cackles]

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:25.496
This so-called game of his
is nothing but a death trap!

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.913
[CAVENDISH grunts]

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:39.525
[CAVENDISH] As soon as
Doflamingo's weapon trafficking

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:42.363
was revealed, along with
the truth of the toys,

00:19:42.396 --> 00:19:44.836
I suspect that every
person in this kingdom

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:47.339
was given a death sentence.

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:49.278
Doflamingo won't
let any information

00:19:49.311 --> 00:19:51.214
escape from Dressrosa.

00:19:51.248 --> 00:19:52.985
That's the real
reason why he locked

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:55.390
the kingdom inside
this Bird Cage.

00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:58.228
Now do you realize
what the situation is?

00:19:58.261 --> 00:20:00.399
He's created a solitary island,

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:03.305
cut off from the
rest of the world.

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.781
The citizens, who are
waiting for a miracle

00:20:07.814 --> 00:20:11.923
or trying to play the game,
will all be killed.

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.726
[LUFFY growls]

00:20:15.195 --> 00:20:16.732
[CAVENDISH] The only way
to escape the island

00:20:16.766 --> 00:20:18.970
and save its people
from this massacre

00:20:19.004 --> 00:20:22.243
is to get rid of Doflamingo
before it's too late.

00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:25.082
The kingdom has been
thrown into absolute chaos,

00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:28.321
but even though the situation
is spiraling out of control,

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:31.862
strangely, Doflamingo seems
to be enjoying himself.

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:36.839
[cackling]

00:20:36.873 --> 00:20:39.712
He's the most cunning
adversary I've ever met.

00:20:39.746 --> 00:20:41.949
I'm certain of that.

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:44.589
[CAVENDISH]
And yet, despite his strength

00:20:44.622 --> 00:20:47.426
and obvious advantages
in this situation,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.499
Doflamingo still
made one key error.

00:20:50.534 --> 00:20:52.437
He held a tournament
at the coliseum

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.644
and invited an army of powerful,
and more importantly,

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:58.448
strong-willed fighters
into his kingdom.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:01.655
There's no way
we'll submit to him!

00:21:03.225 --> 00:21:05.129
[CAVENDISH]
Especially me.

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:08.369
I will defeat Doflamingo
with my own hands!

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:09.905
Stop saying that!

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.711
I already called dibs on
Mingo like a million times!

00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:15.650
This one's personal.
Doflamingo's mine.

00:21:15.684 --> 00:21:18.590
While your passion is
admirable, this is my fight.

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:20.693
[LUFFY] That's cheating!
You said you wanted

00:21:20.727 --> 00:21:23.365
one of the Executives
and nobody complained!

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:25.202
[KYROS]
As a personal matter, yes.

00:21:25.235 --> 00:21:27.206
But it's my duty to
take back this kingdom

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.777
in the name of King Riku!

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.414
[ALL growl]

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:35.757
For ten years, I have waited
to put an end this tragedy!

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.330
Well, my grudge is from 13
years ago. How 'bout that?

00:21:39.363 --> 00:21:41.200
Then mine is from 30 years ago!

00:21:41.234 --> 00:21:46.111
Dirty liar! You're not 30.
You're not even as old as I am!

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:47.313
[LUFFY growls]

00:21:47.346 --> 00:21:48.984
Get off my horse.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.320
You get off my horse!

00:21:50.353 --> 00:21:51.722
That doesn't make sense!

00:21:51.756 --> 00:21:53.425
That's what you
get for inviting me!

00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:55.029
We're at the end of the road!

00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:57.233
[LUFFY gasps]

00:21:57.266 --> 00:21:59.103
[CAVENDISH grunts]

00:22:01.509 --> 00:22:03.579
I can see it!
That's the third level!

00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:06.017
Okay, ignore that and
keep running like this,

00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:07.754
straight up to the palace!

00:22:07.788 --> 00:22:09.424
Go, horse!

00:22:09.457 --> 00:22:13.398
[FARUL whinnies]

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.616
[FARUL whinnies]

00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:24.020
Is something
the matter, Farul?

00:22:24.054 --> 00:22:28.495
[thudding]

00:22:34.007 --> 00:22:40.052
[thudding continues]

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.755
[gasps]

00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:59.156
Holy-! What the heck
are those things?!

00:23:13.854 --> 00:23:16.692
[NARRATOR] Luffy's group is held
up by a group of strange dolls

00:23:16.725 --> 00:23:19.297
as Zoro continues his
battle against Pica.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.468
Suddenly, the stone
giant aims a massive,

00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:23.572
flying fist at
Robin and her allies.

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:26.210
When it seems like Pica's
crushing blow is unavoidable,

00:23:26.244 --> 00:23:30.052
Zoro unleashes a deadly attack
to even the playing field!

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:31.756
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:36.398
"A Hard-Fought Battle Against
Pica! Zoro's Deadly Attack!"
