but it's not a gemstone.

And I figured we'd
find some use for it.

00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,680
Not only is salt
vital to survival,

140

would taste awful!

142
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:08,103
If I take half of
the garlic and aloe,

143
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:10,897
then I can make antiseptic
and burn ointment

144

and use it to heal
the Sky Knight.

meant to be used like this.

151
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,833
[SANJI] Yeah, but disobey the
chef and you probably won't eat.

152
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,126
So it's your call.

153
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,215

--We don't eat it.

00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:40,844
It helps the pot cook.

the stew from the inside out.

Ah...

00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,391
Trust me on this one.

You'll need all the nutrients in
this dish to survive this place.

down your gullet not
ten minutes ago?

Yeah. But that
was just an appetizer.

dinner laid out for us.

174
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,260

I wasn't doing anything anyway,

175
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,764
I'd start hauling this wood
over to the ship for repairs.

176
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:27,432
You're gonna
swim over there, huh?

177
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:28,808
Yeah.

178
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,519
So you don't have a
problem with the giant sharks?

179
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,609
[USOPP] The ship will
still be broken tomorrow,

180
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:40,028
I'll fix it then.
Let's eat, Zoro!

181
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,406
[ZORO]
What a moron.

182
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,411
[NAMI]
Yes! Finished!

183
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,830
[SANJI] Soup's on,
but it's ladies first. Got it?

184
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,082
[CHOPPER]
Sure.

185
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,333
[SANJI] If you would all
please take your seats,

186
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,085
I'll be around with
your meals shortly.

187
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,128
And eat up--I don't
want it getting cold.

188
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:59,130
[NAMI] Now, if you would all
listen up while you eat,

189
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,591
I'll explain how we're going
to handle this tomorrow.

190
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,426
[USOPP]
Oohh, it looks tasty!

191
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,888
You said it. Thanks.

192
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,723
Hey, this is important,
you guys.

193
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,517
[SANJI]
Then I am all ears, Nami-sweet.

194
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,227
[LUFFY]
Me, too!

195
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,230
Wow. Check out the
heart-shaped carrots!

196
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:19,192
You really go
the extra mile, Sanji.

197
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,611
You're welcome. Yes.

198
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:25,115
I did all that just to
impress you, Usopp.

199
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:27,575
[USOPP]
Uh... All right.

200
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,745
Anyway... Let's review
Noland's book first.

201
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,707
He discovered the
City of Gold 400 years ago.

202
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,750
However, after leaving the
island and returning with

203
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:38,545
his king, he found the
gold ruins had vanished.

204
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,381
Luckily, we now know what
happened to these ruins.

205
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:44,217
Keep the ladle handy,
I'll be back for more after I--

206
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,301
[bong]

207
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,345
Sanji, pay attention!

208
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,472
[SANJI] I was, but he
was interrupting you!

209
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,142
[LUFFY] I compliment his food
and this is the thanks I get?

210
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,309
Sheesh!

211
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,979
[NAMI growls]
The point I was getting at

212
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:57,313
is that the gold didn't sink

213
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:59,566
into the ocean, but was
shot up here into the sky

214
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,861
by the knock-up stream
just like we were.

215
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,446
Do you really
think a whole island

216
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,072
could have done that?

217
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:08,408
[NAMI] Well, it's the only
thing that makes sense.

218
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,160
Remember? Cricket
said that every time

219
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:13,121
this phenomenon occurs it's
in a different location.

220
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,998
Yeah, that explosion
was enormous.

221
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:17,125
I'm not surprised
it lifted an island.

222
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,253
[ZORO] Hmm. It's just hard
to believe that the forest

223
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,631
we're sitting in is the same
one we saw back on Jaya.

224
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,342
[ROBIN] I believe that
has something to do with

225
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:28,345
the odd composition of
the island clouds up here.

226
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:30,680
Look at all the trees,
fish, and wildlife.

227
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,515
Something about this
environment dramatically

228
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,434
increases growth rates.

229
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,436
Which explains how
a society here could have been

230
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,438
swallowed up by these
burgeoning forces.

231
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,940
[SANJI sighs]
So tragic.

232
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,734
[CHOPPER] That also explains
why the South Birds

233
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:46,237
who saved us were so huge.
I couldn't believe it.

234
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,491
Yeah, 400 years of
growing will do that to a bird.

235
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,243
[SANJI] Then why-- Here.
Why did those South Birds

236
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,163
go to such great lengths
to save you guys?

237
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,499
Um... I don't know.

238
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:00,001
But, when they saw him,
they referred to

239
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:02,837
--the Sky Knight as God.
--[BOTH gasp]

240
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,215
He's god? So if we
beat the crud out of this guy,

241
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:06,591
then our job here is done!

242
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,842
[USOPP]
No, genius!

243
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,260
How did you get that out
of what he's saying?!

244
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:11,721
[NAMI] Would both of you
loudmouths just pipe down?!

245
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:12,806
[USOPP]
Yeah, shut up!

246
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,391
[LUFFY]
Yeah. Wait, who's a loudmouth?

247
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:17,227
--[USOPP] You are!
--[NAMI] You both are. Can it.

248
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,479
Now does anyone recall
what Noland's log said

249
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:20,897
about the City of Gold?

250
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,066
[LUFFY]
I do! It's a city of gold!

251
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,150
[USOPP]
You're such a dumbass!

252
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,152
Do you ever think
before you talk?!

253
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:27,779
I think he wrote
about South Birds

254
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,698
and a giant gold bell.

255
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,033
'Course there
could be a lot more.

256
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,743
The last thing
he wrote in the log before

257
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,829
he died was something odd.

258
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,414
It's something
I can't figure out

259
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:39,290
even after seeing this island.

260
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,043
It says "The City of Gold
is in a skull's right eye."

261
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,546
That's it! Check it out.

262
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:47,841
I matched up Robin's map of
Jaya with the old Skypiea map

263
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,884
that we found in the shipwreck.

264
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:51,720
Of course, this isn't
exact and there may be

265
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:54,347
some incorrect overlap, but
when you match up the location

266
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,892
of Cricket's house with the
broken part we found up here,

267
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:01,646
this is what Jaya looked
like 400 years ago.

268
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,273
Neat! It's a skull!

269
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:06,151
It is a skull!

270
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:07,444
Well?

271
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:08,445
[LUFFY gasps]

272
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,155
Way to go, Nami!

273
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,740
[CHOPPER]
We did it!

274
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:15,326
[USOPP] Okay. But where
in the skull's right eye?

275
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,288
[NAMI] Hmm...
I'm thinking right here.

276
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,791
It's the one structure
that's actually inside the eye.

277
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,044
And no one's found it yet
because of all the people

278
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:27,339
who have tried, we're the
ones who had both maps.

279
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:31,760
[USOPP] Ah. Of course.
We must be lucky pirates.

280
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,094
It kinda makes sense.

281
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,637
Hidden treasure!

282
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,431
[CHOPPER]
Treasure! [laughs]

283
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:38,141
The only thing left
to do is make our way

284
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:39,768
to the skull's eye.

285
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,811
But since we can't
leave the ship unguarded,

286
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,606
tomorrow morning, we'll split
the crew into two teams.

287
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,233
This is our time.

288
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,402
On the other side of
this island waits more gold

289
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,112
than we've ever dreamed.

290
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,012
Wyper--

291
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,723
[WYPER] How serious are
Kamakiri's injuries?

292
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,267
[GENBOU] Well. They're
tending to him right now.

293
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,936
He's back there.

294
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,646
Is he going to make it?

295
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,106
[GENBOU]
See for yourself.

296
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:28,817
[WYPER] I didn't expect him
to be defeated like that.

297
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,820
[GENBOU] What can we do?
Ohm will not easily be beaten.

298
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,446
It's me.

299
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,447
[WYPER]
Hmm?

300
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,949
[gasps]

301
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:41,037
[LAKI whimpers] It was my fault.
He's dying because of me!

302
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:52,716
[LUFFY sighs]
Now that's what I call gourmet!

303
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,175
Tomorrow, we get the gold!

304
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,553
[NAMI]
You got it! [giggles]

305
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,304
You think it'll be sunny again?

306
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,515
We are above the clouds
so I'd guess "yes."

307
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,559
Let's put out the fires
if we don't need them.

308
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,978
It's beginning
to get late, you guys.

309
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,354
We don't want
to announce our location

310
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,647
to our enemies.

311
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:09,941
[LUFFY]
Hmph. What a rookie move.

312
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,359
You hear that Usopp?

313
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,487
She wants us to douse the fire.
What are we gonna do?

314
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:15,488
Huh?

315
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,614
[USOPP]
I don't know.

316
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,450
It's not really
her fault though.

317
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,286
She's never been exposed
to this kind of living before.

318
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,829
We should be tolerant.

319
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:27,000
[ROBIN] Huh?
What are you two saying?

320
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,960
[LUFFY sobs] You're always
supposed to have a campfire when

321
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,463
you camp that's what
makes it camping!

322
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:32,839
[USOPP sobs] 'Cause it's
the warmth of the flame

323
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,716
fighting through
all this wilderness

324
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,760
that reminds us
that we're human!

325
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,137
[NAMI] It's never-ending
with those idiots.

326
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,556
Hey! Lay off the sob stories!

327
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,475
You know how dangerous
this island can be.

328
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,393
Let's not give it
any help in killing us.

329
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,644
Don't care.

330
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,396
We're in the middle of
a war between priests

331
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,024
protecting their god and
guerillas forging a coup!

332
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,068
Not to mention the giant,
bloodthirsty monsters

333
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,487
that wait around
every corner to eat us

334
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,863
[CHOPPER]
Not monsters!

335
00:15:56,946 --> 00:15:59,491
Sky island scary.
Sky island scary.

336
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:01,618
Luffy, take a look!

337
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,828
Is this enough
wood for your fire?

338
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:06,414
Can you idiots
think for one second?!

339
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,085
[SANJI] Heh. Don't worry.
Wild animals are afraid of fire.

340
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,045
They'll stay away.

341
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,713
But they're surrounding us.

342

[GAN FALL] I apologize for being
such a burden to you all.

Hey. You're too hard
on yourself old man.

410
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,404
You saved Chopper, and you
kept our ship from being blown

Conis. Is she okay?

Very much so.

her father at my house.

They're fine.

[SANJI] Great. I was worried
she'd never see me again.

I'm so happy that
both of them are safe.

I'm sorry for eavesdropping,

433
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,208
but I heard your earlier
conversation about how

434
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,837
this island was known
long ago by the name Jaya.

435
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,297
[ROBIN]
Yeah, that's right.

436
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,299
[GAN FALL] But I believe you
have yet to hear the story

437
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,801
of how this island
on which we sit...

438
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,679
...came to be known
as such holy ground.

00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:59,064
Is this what was
so distracting for you

441
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,357
in battle, Laki?

442
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,150
Are you here to sabotage us?

443
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,235
Get in our way and slow us down?

444
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,323
No, I'm not.
I feel awful for Kamakiri.

445
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:10,075
[WYPER]
We were fighting the priests!

446
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,118
We can't afford to be
off task at all if we want

447
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,370
to make it to God's Shrine!

448
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,497
Apologizing won't
fix anything--I know that!

449
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,499
So give that back to me. Now!

450
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,751
It belongs to Aisa! It's hers!

451
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,836
I promised I would bring
back some vearth for her!

452
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,254

Kamakiri. You shouldn't
even be standing right now.

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,140
[KAMAKIRI]
I can still fight.

456
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,312
[KAMAKIRI] You're right about
this being our best time

457
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,064
to strike the Upper Yard.

458
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,195
With Satori gone,
we proved today

459
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:50,115
that we can defeat
the remaining priests.

460
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:53,076
I say we attack
again tomorrow, at first light.

461
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:03,003
[GAN FALL] The ground of
the Upper Yard must remind

462
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,839
you Blue Sea people
of your home far below.

463
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,424
It is similar, right?

464
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,676
[ZORO]
It is.

465
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,137
[GAN FALL]
Yes. You're lucky.

466
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,556
What you see all around us
and beneath our feet

467
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:18,101
is something that does not
naturally exist in the sky.

468

[GAN FALL] Island cloud
can support plant life,

469
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,689
but it cannot generate its own.

470
00:21:22,772 --> 00:21:26,901
Greenery and soil are both
foreign things to our life here.

471
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,202
[GAN FALL] Our people have
our own name for this.

472
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,704
It's vearth.

473
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:42,250
[GAN FALL] Those living among
the clouds hold this sacred.

474
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,377
It's what they all desire.

00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,257
[KAMAKIRI]
Once we kill Eneru...

476

...there will be no need
for you to sneak around

single bag of vearth.

The time is now.

479
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,396
[KAMAKIRI] We will return
after 400 years of exile--

480
