1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,262
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,498
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,672
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,773
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,377
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,113
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,550
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,519
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,989
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,192
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hat
Pirates left Water 7

49
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,660
and set sail for the New World.

50
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,928
While en route,

51
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,430
they came across a strange ship
with a tired and hungry crew.

52
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,700
The Straw Hats took them in,
but were met with a surprise.

53
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,303
[JIRO] There's someone else
I need you to take a look at!

54
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,540
[CHOPPER] Is--Is that him?

55
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,075
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

56
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,243
[CAMPACINO] What is it?

57
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,246
[SALCHOW] The trophies are
being cornered as we speak.

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,447
[CAMPACINO] Oh?

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,648
[CAMPACINO]
Well, well, well!

60
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,084
What fortunate timing.

61
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,419
To hell with the mission!

62
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,486
We won't do it!

63
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,689
We'll take this ship
and launch a counterattack!

64
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,658
If we don't, Vigaro's
death will be in vain!

65
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,727
[FRANKY] Hey, guys!

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,530
I'm not really the type to go
looking for an apology, but...

67
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,564
...you should
probably give me one

68
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,100
after making up that lame story.

69
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,271
[LUFFY]
Sunny in a Pinch!

70
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,773
Roar, Secret Superspeed Mecha!

71
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,724
[STANSEN] Whoa! Whoa!

72
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,525
Let's just calm down here, okay?

73
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,161
Look, we're not a bunch
of criminals or anything!

74
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,398
We're just some common,
ordinary fishermen!

75
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,532
Right, guys? Right?

76
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,469
[laughs nervously]

77
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,771
And you really expect
us to buy that crap?

78
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,273
Correct me if I'm wrong,

79
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,807
but trying to drug
a bunch of pirates

80
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,377
doesn't sound like something
"common, ordinary fishermen"

81
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,412
would do, now does it?

82
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,823
[FRANKY] You better
get your story straight,

83
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,393
because it's time to tell us
what the hell's going on here.

84
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,228
[STANSEN]
Please! Let's not be hasty!

85
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,130
If we discuss this
like civilized people,

86
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,598
I'm sure we could work this out.

87
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,265
Or not.

88
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,533
--"Or not"?
--"Or not"?

89
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,168
Uh... I mean--

90
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,772
Hey! What are you doing?
Get back here!

91
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,741
[STANSEN] Guyle! Stop it!

92
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,110
[GUYLE] There's no point in
negotiating with these people!

93
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,278
There're only three of them!

94
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,780
Let's take this ship by force!

95
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,781
Yeah!

96
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,683
Then we could finally
be a proper crew again!

97
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,786
I'm sick and tired of being
a pawn for those bastards!

98
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,888
No! Wait a minute!

99
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,290
These guys helped us out
when we were tired and hungry!

100
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,825
He's right!
There's no need to--

101
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,726
Shut up!

102
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,628
If you aren't going
to help us fight,

103
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,897
then we'll do it on our own!

104
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,333
All right, but at least
leave the lady out of this!

105
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,269
Yeah!
She's too pretty to hurt!

106
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,637
--Yahhh!
--Yahhh!

107
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,239
So much for "discussing
this like civilized people".

108
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,708
Glad we've got
everything out in the open!

109
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,710
[yelling]

110
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,145
[yelling]

111
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,751
I said stop it, dammit!

112
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,654
Whoa!

113
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,322
What the hell?

114
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,398
Sorry about that!

115
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,934
I know all this must look
very underhanded and shady,

116
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,869
but, uh--I assure all of you.

117
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,171
We have the very
best of intentions!

118
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,240
Right? Right? See?

119
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,174
[laughs nervously]

120
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:15,975
Cut the crap!

121
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,677
What are you guys
trying to hide?

122
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,580
Our patience is starting
to wear pretty thin here.

123
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,116
I'm freezing!

124
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,918
Come on, haven't you guys taken
care of these morons yet?

125
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,687
[NAMI] I knew there
was something suspicious

126
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,655
about all this.
Seriously.

127
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,392
You look more like a bunch of
thugs than some fishermen.

128
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,426
Geez!

129
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,762
[NAMI] Did you really
think you could fool us?

130
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,864
We're way too smart for that!

131
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,532
Well, most of us are.

132
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,501
So what now, Stansen?

133
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,869
[RACE] We're screwed!

134
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,505
Now. You better start talking.

135
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,675
It seems you've
left us no choice.

136
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,677
[STANSEN] Retreat!

137
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,712
What?!

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,517
[splash]

139
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,252
--[FRANKY] Get back here!
--[SANJI] Cowards!

140
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,520
[FRANKY] Dammit!

141
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,556
If you guys don't wanna talk,
then I'll just have to blast ya!

142
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,591
Forget about it.
Just let 'em go.

143
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,226
We have other things
to worry about.

144
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,362
Like Chopper.
I can't find him anywhere.

145
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,496
[SANJI] What? Chopper?

146
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,231
Wait. Yeah, where is he?

147
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,700
You don't think something
happened to him, do you?

148
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,737
He may have been abducted
by those fake fishermen.

149
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,273
I hate to say it,
but I think you're right.

150
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,575
Sneaky bastards.

151
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,976
It's just a hunch
at this point,

152
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,711
but boarding their ship
will be the fastest way

153
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,480
to get to the bottom of this.

154
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,648
Let's get moving.

155
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,949
The wind's starting to pick up.

156
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,285
We'll be getting
a storm anytime now.

157
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,686
Before we go,

158
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,656
we need to figure out
what to do with these two.

159
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,660
[NAMI]
Ugh! Those nitwits!

160
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,465
--[NAMI] Wake up!
--[punching noises]

161
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,936
[LUFFY] Man! I'm freezing
my butt off out here!

162
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,003
Cold...

163
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,040
But that doesn't explain
why my head hurts so much.

164
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,542
Ah... ah... ah...

165
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,511
Ah-choo!

166
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,545
[SALCHOW] What?

167
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,581
I told you not to
underestimate those pirates!

168
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,582
Imbecile!

169
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,418
Our plan was going so
well and you ruined it!

170
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,421
Sorry.
I didn't mean to--

171
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,755
[sneezes]

172
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,823
We'll get 'em next time!

173
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,991
[sneezes]

174
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,759
[sneezes]

175
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,461
[SALCHOW] Whatever!
It doesn't matter anymore.

176
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,630
--I want you to stand down.
--[STANSEN] Huh?

177
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,032
[SALCHOW] You heard me.
I said to stand down.

178
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,968
From the start,
you useless cowards

179
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,871
haven't done anything but
screw up and get in the way.

180
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,006
So stand down.
Are we clear?

181
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,708
[STANSEN] Yes. Crystal.

182
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,942
Right! You got it!

183
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,810
[laughs]

184
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,612
Yes. Yes.

185
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,715
Roger that.
Very well then. Standing down.

186
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,817
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

187
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,720
[SALCHOW] Listen up, men.

188
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,421
There's been a change of plans.

189
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,024
It's time to use Trap Seagull.

190
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,592
[STANSEN'S MEN] Yes, sir!

191
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:53,432
[USOPP sneezes]

192
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,500
Sneaky crybabies!

193
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,670
We lend them a hand,
then all they do is kidnap our--

194
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,372
[USOPP sneezes]

195
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,007
Chopper!

196
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,114
A-ha! There you are!

197
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,849
What have you done with Chopper?

198
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,217
[STANSEN] Straw Hat Captain!

199
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,954
I sincerely apologize for
abusing your hospitality.

200
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,056
But this is where we part ways!

201
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,691
We what?

202
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,892
Hey! Hold on!

203
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,761
What do you think
you're doing? Stop!

204
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,862
[SANJI] This is bad!

205
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,697
He's gonna cut the tow rope
that connects our ships!

206
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,264
[ALL] What?

207
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,832
Dammit! Wait!

208
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,136
Now, Gum-Gum Pistol!

209
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,842
The wind!

210
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,411
[LUFFY yelling]

211
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,147
Oh, crap!

212
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,949
Devil Fruit powers!

213
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,252
Sorry, but it's time
for you to go!

214
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,421
What the--?

215
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,089
Nice, Robin!

216
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,357
Way to go!

217
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,062
Another crewmember
with Devil Fruit powers?

218
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,129
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 327A]
Mr. Salchow.

219
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,465
Preparations for Trap Seagull
are now complete.

220
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,367
[SALCHOW] Good. Good.

221
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,270
Then let's get
this started, shall we?

222
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,005
Showtime!

223
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
What the--?

224
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,481
Music?

225
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,184
Hey, you guys hearing
what I'm hearing?

226
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,518
It's coming from this way.

227
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,754
I hear it, too. Weird.

228
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,992
Something's coming.

229
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,765
[USOPP] What's that?

230
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,937
No way!

231
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,205
The Marines are here!

232
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,439
[ALL] What?

233
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,308
How the hell'd they
track us down so fast?

234
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,909
Perfect! Just what we need!

235
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,411
[USOPP] Gahh! No!

236
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,779
[LUFFY] Get us outta here, Nami!

237
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,446
[NAMI] Right! I'm on it!

238
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,948
[USOPP] Go away!

239
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,151
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 327B] The Straw
Hat ship is on the move, sir!

240
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,286
[SALCHOW]
Let's shake things up a bit.

241
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,354
Do it!

242
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,389
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 327A]
Sir!

243
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,062
[explosions]

244
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,565
We're under attack!
They're shooting at us!

245
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,833
Nami, hurry!

246
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,468
They're gonna blow us to bits!

247
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,404
I know, I know!
Stop yelling!

248
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,338
Sanji!

249
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,773
[SANJI] Aye-aye!

250
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,010
[SALCHOW]
Hahaha!

251
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,912
And now...

252
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,047
...light 'em up!

253
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,049
Light 'em up! Light 'em up!

254
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,254
More Marines dead ahead!

255
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,322
Nami! Do something!

256
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,357
Quick! Turn left!

257
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,391
Right!

258
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,494
Good! Keep it up!

259
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,529
Next!

260
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,964
Number 67!
Light 'em up!

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,835
What? No way!

262
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,237
[NAMI]
There, too?

263
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,972
They're everywhere!

264
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,078
[USOPP screams]

265
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,847
You're kidding!
We're screwed!

266
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,517
[LUFFY] That's a lotta boats!

267
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,287
No... We're surrounded.

268
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,890
Yes. Just as planned.

269
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,093
So... What now?

270
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,127
[screaming]

271
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,395
Holy crap!

272
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,231
Nami, help us! Do something!

273
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,866
Gah! Shut up, already!

274
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,534
I'm doing the best I can!

275
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,304
Nami! Take a look! Over there!

276
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,972
[NAMI]
What is it? An escape route?

277
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,341
[USOPP] A what?
Where? Where? Let me see!

278
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,543
Hey! Yeah, you're right!

279
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,512
Think we can we make it?

280
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,613
Go for it!

281
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,014
[SANJI] Roger!

282
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,522
[USOPP screaming]

283
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,591
Hey! What's wrong?

284
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,326
The wind!
It changed direction!

285
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,161
We can't hold the helm!

286
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,966
[USOPP]
Whoaaa! We're done for!

287
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,068
Damn! I can't get her to turn!

288
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,369
[FRANKY] Move it!

289
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,104
Bastard!
What are you doing?

290
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,973
Forget already?

291
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,608
It's like I told you before.

292
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,478
The Soldier Dock System was made
for situations like this!

293
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,447
Channel Zero...

294
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,682
...Activated!

295
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,684
Cola Engine...

296
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,021
...Paddle Ship Sunny!

297
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,961
[FRANKY] Go!

298
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,400
What the--?
What's going on?

299
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,637
Jiro! Help me!

300
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,306
We've got to keep him still or
his wounds will open up again!

301
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,340
Right!

302
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,013
[LUFFY] All right! We got away!

303
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,080
[USOPP] Yeah!

304
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,549
And all the Marines can do
is sit back and watch!

305
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,550
Nyah, nyah!

306
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,551
You got that right!

307
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,520
This boat's faster than
anything they've got!

308
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,327
[FRANKY] Super!

309
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,233
[ACCINO HENCHMAN 327C]
Mission accomplished, sir.

310
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,135
The Straw Hat Pirates are
heading straight towards

311
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,504
the Frozen Highway, as planned.

312
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,039
[SALCHOW] Of course they are.

313
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,241
They're morons and I'm a genius.

314
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,678
They've fallen into our trap,
just like I said they would.

315
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,081
Report this to
Campacino immediately!

316
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,535
Chopper! Where are you?

317
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,370
Hey! Chopper!

318
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,672
--We're here to take you back!
--Who's that?

319
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,274
[LUFFY] If you can hear me,
say something!

320
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,643
It's Luffy!
I'll be right back!

321
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,278
Hold on, Doctor! Wait!

322
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,047
Hey! Stop hiding! Chopper!

323
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,848
[GUYLE] Don't move!

324
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,650
If you take one
more step, I'll--

325
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,485
Enough!

326
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,187
Captain Straw Hat...

327
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:49,755
[STANSEN] Please!

328
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,457
Please forgive me!

329
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,459
[GUYLE] Stop that!

330
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,727
Why are you begging to them?

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,228
Shut up!

332
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,229
My apologies.

333
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,333
I'm sorry I was so rude,
and for deceiving you.

334
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,036
On our behalf,
I beg your forgiveness!

335
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,105
I don't care
about any of that.

336
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,608
We came here for one reason
only: to get Chopper back.

337
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,610
--Right?
--[NAMI] Mm-hmm.

338
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,579
Grow a backbone already.

339
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,814
I haven't seen him,

340
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,816
but I'd be more than happy
to help you look for him.

341
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,251
If he's not on
your ship, then he's--

342
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,352
[CHOPPER] Luffy!

343
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,655
[LUFFY] Chopper!

344
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,690
We've been looking
for you everywhere!

345
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,625
Come on! Let's get outta here.

346
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,359
But I--

347
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,528
Hold on!
We still need him here!

348
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,697
If the doctor leaves now,
he's done for!

349
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,532
[LUFFY] Huh? Who is?

350
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,168
I won't let you take him,
no matter what!

351
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:36,802
Hold on.

352
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,804
[CHOPPER] Jiro, wait!

353
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,639
[RACE] Stop it, Jiro!

354
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,175
Just calm down!
You'll get yourself killed!

355
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,276
I don't care!

356
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,412
I'm not afraid of dying!
You hear me?

357
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm not a coward
like the rest of you!

358
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,515
I'll fight 'em!

359
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,318
No matter how strong the
enemy is, I'll keep fighting!

360
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,753
I'll win or die trying!

361
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,822
Let me go!

362
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,624
Chopper? What's going on?

363
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,159
What's his problem?

364
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,527
[CHOPPER] Listen, Luffy.

365
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,761
I hate to ask,

366
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,464
but I'd like to stay on this
ship just a little bit longer.

367
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,366
There's someone here
who's badly wounded.

368
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,270
I treated him and he's stable,
but he still needs my attention.

369
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,538
Please.

370
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,307
Let me look after him until he
regains consciousness, at least.

371
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,809
Sure. You got it.

372
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,644
We can wait a bit.

373
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,855
[snoring]

374
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,956
[JIRO] Doctor.

375
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,425
I appreciate you staying.

376
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,426
[CHOPPER] Jiro.

377
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,829
I don't really know what
the situation is here.

378
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,732
It seems like you and your
friends are in some kind of jam.

379
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,936
But for what it's worth, even
though I'm a pirate, first--

380
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,471
I'm a doctor.

381
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,506
If there's someone
who needs my help,

382
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,009
I do whatever I can
to save them.

383
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,379
Believe it or not,
we're pirates, too.

384
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,348
Wow, really?
I had no idea.

385
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,520
And the man you see
lying here is our leader.

386
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,888
"The Phoenix".

387
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:05,991
Captain Puzzle of the
Phoenix Pirate Crew.

388
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,760
The Phoenix?

389
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:08,694
[JIRO] Yeah.

390
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,529
He's called that
because no matter how bad

391
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,031
the situation might be,

392
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,966
even if he's on
the verge of death,

393
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,502
he always finds the
strength to rise up.

394
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,704
Just like a phoenix.

395
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:19,638
[JIRO] Captain!

396
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,607
[GIANT PIRATE 327A]
Hahahaha! He's dead!

397
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,409
Burnt to ashes!

398
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,511
What? But how?

399
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,612
[PUZZLE] Give it up!

400
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,580
You won't kill me so easily!

401
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,849
[GIANT PIRATE 327A]
He's some kind of monster!

402
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,387
[PUZZLE]
Actually, I'm a phoenix!

403
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,657
Just like the
rest of my crew,

404
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,993
I thought this was
the man who would become

405
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,928
King of the Pirates.

406
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,597
But things are
different out there.

407
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,867
The New World is
a league of its very own.

408
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,403
You've been there? Really?

409
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,504
[JIRO] Yeah, we have.

410
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,074
But we didn't stand a chance.

411
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,842
Even Captain Puzzle
had to retreat

412
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,811
from the enemies
we met there.

413
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,080
Me and the rest of the crew
escaped before we got hurt,

414
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,748
but it was a close call.

415
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,983
We were totally outclassed.

416
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,887
[JIRO] But either way,
I still believe in him!

417
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,391
Captain Puzzle has the courage
to resurrect himself again,

418
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,992
just like a phoenix!

419
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,698
[GUYLE] Dammit. I've had enough!

420
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,900
I'm sick of Stansen's crap!

421
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,402
Shh! Hey, careful!

422
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,704
He's still our commander
right now, you know!

423
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,673
If he hears you,
you'll get in trouble!

424
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,709
Huh. Like I care
what that coward thinks.

425
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,079
He has no right to
lead any one of us!

426
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,381
[GUYLE] You guys feel
the same way, don't you?

427
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,117
Guyle's right. This sucks!

428
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,519
We can't just keep
going on like this!

429
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,720
Yeah!

430
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,490
Haven't we suffered enough
humiliation from those bastards?

431
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,891
Not only did they
steal our flag,

432
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,994
they conned us into working
as their little lapdogs!

433
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,138
[GUYLE] What the hell
is wrong with you?

434
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,806
I'm not joining up with them!

435
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,741
I'd rather die! You hear me?

436
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,076
[STANSEN] You fool!

437
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,678
Vigaro went so far as
to sacrifice himself

438
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,746
to protect you!

439
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,681
He gave his life for you!

440
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,785
I won't let that
sacrifice be in vain!

441
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,988
[GUYLE] I believe that if
our captain recovered,

442
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,590
he would lead our crew
to recapture our flag.

443
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,594
He'd take back our dignity,
make us pirates again.

444
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,063
[GUYLE] But Stansen
doesn't think like that.

445
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:25,864
He's different.

446
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,866
"Different" how?
What do you mean?

447
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,503
He only cares about saving
his own skin at any cost.

448
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,005
Didn't you see
the look on his face

449
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,073
when he was talking
to that hunter?

450
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,578
[GUYLE] Ever since our
defeat in the New World,

451
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,080
he's lost his spirit.

452
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,782
We have no choice.

453
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,618
We need to wait for
our captain to recover.

454
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,120
But that doesn't mean
I have to accept

455
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,422
what's going on
in the meantime.

456
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,560
[GUYLE] Ever since
our captain was injured,

457
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,229
Stansen's forced us
to serve the hunters.

458
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,797
That ends now!

459
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,566
As a proud pirate of this crew,

460
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,569
I will stand up to the hunters
and fight them to the death!

461
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,804
The Phoenix Pirates
will rise again!

462
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,239
Then I'll fight beside you!

463
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,240
As will I!

464
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,741
What about you?

465
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,776
I became a Phoenix Pirate

466
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,844
because of how much
I admired Captain Puzzle.

467
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,112
You can count on me!

468
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:14,980
Yeah!

469
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:15,881
No matter what happens
to the captain,

470
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,250
I won't let anyone
sully his good name!

471
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,885
I'm a Phoenix Pirate, too!

472
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,086
Agreed.

473
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,922
I don't think Vigaro would
like to see us in this state.

474
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,091
We can't let it end like this.

475
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,092
Right.

476
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,661
Then it's settled.
We'll fight them together.

477
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,598
Even if our captain can't
fight alongside us,

478
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,666
we still have to
show these bastards

479
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,102
what the Phoenix
Pirates are made of.

480
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,151
Whoa!

481
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,887
Nothing but giant icebergs
in every direction.

482
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,222
[NAMI] What's going on?

483
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,991
Something's wrong here.

484
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,726
It's almost as if
the direction we sail

485
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,995
is at the whim
of these icebergs.

486
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,666
[NAMI] What the hell?

487
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,901
[SANJI] That was close!

488
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,536
Sanji! Look out!

489
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,237
Oh, crap!

490
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,905
[NAMI] Hard to port!

491
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,610
Damn these things!

492
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,914
[SANJI]
Whew! An even closer call!

493
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,816
What's up with these icebergs?

494
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,752
How can they move so fast?

495
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,020
I don't know.

496
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,989
But I do know that
something fishy's going on!

497
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,724
It's almost like these
things are moving

498
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,226
of their own free will!

499
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,061
[CAMPACINO] What's that?

500
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,296
[SALCHOW] Well, to
tell you the truth, sir,

501
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,897
I was a little careless.

502
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,565
But everything's
under control now!

503
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,200
The trophy is heading
to the usual place!

504
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,468
Don't worry, my brother!

505
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,705
[CAMPACINO] Let's lay off this
"brother" business, shall we?

506
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,939
[SALCHOW] Sorry!
I was just trying to...

507
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,643
[ARBELL] Campacino! Honestly!
Are you bothering him again?

508
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,711
Salchow.

509
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,279
You haven't failed in your
mission, now have you?

510
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,081
Do you still have
the target in sight?

511
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,115
[SALCHOW] Well, not exactly!

512
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,850
But it's not like they've
escaped or anything!

513
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,652
Everything's still
going according to plan!

514
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,587
You believe me,
don't you, honey?

515
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,257
What? I'm so
disappointed in you!

516
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,358
[SALCHOW] Don't say that!

517
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,160
Your approval is
all I seek, my dear!

518
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,194
Please, forgive me!

519
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,630
[ARBELL] No. Not yet, anyway.

520
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,199
[CAMPACINO] Let's end
this party with a bang.

521
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,001
Once they arrive,
we'll claim our trophy

522
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,837
as a last-minute
birthday present.

523
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,173
[BRINDO] This is going
better than I thought!

524
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,441
To think--

525
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:25,377
The whole family coming together
to get a perfect gift for Papa!

526
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,146
[ARBELL] Just wait a
little bit longer, Papa!

527
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,882
[LIL] Hey, Arbell.
Can I go with you?

528
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,317
[ARBELL] No, Lil. You can't.

529
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm paired with my
darling. You know that!

530
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,388
Don't be silly!

531
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,889
I hate that man.

532
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,658
[laughing]

533
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,661
A total bounty
of over 600 million.

534
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,996
Hurry up and show them to me!

535
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,868
Don't get a chance
like this every day.

536
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,071
[CAMPACINO] A toast!
To our beloved Papa, Don Accino,

537
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,307
and to the rest of the
Accino Family as well!

538
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,109
May fortune bless us all!

539
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,277
And to the present
for our Papa,

540
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,380
the bounty of the Straw Hats!

541
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:03,014
[ALL] Cheers!

542
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,421
Well then, my beloved
sons and daughters.

543
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,189
Time to move out.

544
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,025
Let the hunt begin!

545
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,866
[NAMI] Whoa! Look out!

546
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,300
Quick, Sanji! Turn!

547
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,835
[SANJI] Aye-Aye, Nami!

548
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,837
What the hell is wrong
with this place?

549
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,873
[NAMI] It's like we're
being surrounded.

550
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,908
This is bad!
Turn the rudder! Hurry!

551
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,309
[SANJI] It's not responding!

552
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,912
Why aren't Luffy
and Chopper back yet?

553
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,380
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

554
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,783
The Dream Sinking
in the New World!

555
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,018
The Disillusioned Pirate,
Puzzle!

556
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,421
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
