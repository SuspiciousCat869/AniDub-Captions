[TOY MAN B] Just a friendly
neighborhood soldier,

don't mind me!

00:11:46.479 --> 00:11:49.284
Hmm, that's odd. Have we
met somewhere before?

00:11:49.317 --> 00:11:51.389
I know your face.

00:11:51.422 --> 00:11:53.193
Huh...?

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:55.631
Ahh...

00:11:55.664 --> 00:11:58.737
Oh, that's it! You were

Someone help me!

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:04.414
Is it a toy or a dude?

Hey, Luffy, look at that!

[TOY MAN C laughing]

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:16.105
[NARRATOR]
Everywhere you look,

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:19.946
as if it were nothing
peculiar at all,

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:23.653
there are toys,
living alongside humans.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.361
[NARRATOR]
Only outsiders seem perplexed

by these colorful citizens.

Aw, not again!

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.772
Did he say "again"?

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:52.210
You got some maniac on
the loose? Is that it?

00:12:52.243 --> 00:12:54.649
No, just very passionate women.

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:57.453
And they're the
jealous type. You know.

00:12:57.487 --> 00:13:00.595
So if their lover cheats
on them, for example,

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:02.231
things get a little violent.

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:03.332
[ZORO]
A "little"?

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.536
[TOY MAN B]
Seems like the pretty ones

Yeah! Let's eat here!

Excuse me.

[FUJITORA] I heard there was a
gambling house somewhere nearby.

00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:55.844
Do you know where it might be?

00:15:55.878 --> 00:16:00.419
Nah, sorry, pal. I'm afraid
this is my first time here.

Hey, but there is a restaurant

00:16:26.372 --> 00:16:28.275
Whoa! That scared me!

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:29.478
Sir Luffy!

00:16:29.512 --> 00:16:32.618
We cannot afford to whittle away
the hours in this place!

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:36.893
Time is short. I must
search for Kanjuro promptly!

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.031
Whoa, whoa, relax bro.

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:40.768
I know we gotta move quick,

but we can't go
runnin' around blind,

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:45.175
we gotta gather info first.

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.786
Hey, isn't this fishy to you?

00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:52.023
The king of the country
abdicated his throne

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:54.194
this morning. I kind
of figured this place

00:16:54.228 --> 00:16:57.000
would be in chaos, but
nobody seems to care.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:59.605
[ZORO] Maybe they haven't
heard the news yet.

00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:02.243
What? No way.

Why is that bad?

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.930
'Cause you were on the front

Well, uh, you see...

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.566
In this country,
many people still believe

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.137
in old legends about fairies.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.372

What kind of legends?

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:56.285
More like, people see
fairies. Or do they?

Indeed! All the time!

00:18:00.528 --> 00:18:01.729
Fascinating, right?

00:18:01.762 --> 00:18:04.000
It's been that way
for centuries!

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.138
Although most of us
have never seen them,

we all know they exist!

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:09.879
And do you know what
people call them?

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:13.018
I'll tell you! They call them...

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:17.160
...the guardian deities
of Dressrosa. Or do they?

00:18:17.193 --> 00:18:19.097
