00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.147
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.918
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:34.557
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.359
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.531
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.270
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.022
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.393
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:46.233
as the New World.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.775
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:51.977
they held.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.489
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:02.464
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:02.498 --> 00:03:04.869
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:09.011
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.045 --> 00:03:12.451
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.163
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.267
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.137
intending to destroy
a Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.439
in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:25.711
However, plans changed
when Law was captured

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:27.214
by Doflamingo.

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:29.452
Luffy has now snuck
into the Royal Palace

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:31.857
to rescue his apprehended ally.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.130

[BOTH yelling]

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:52.565
Calm down, Sugar!
Everything's all right!

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.736
Please don't pass
out on me, okay?

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.919
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Usopp
was able to knock Sugar out,

00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:05.323
which freed the toys
from their terrible curse.

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:10.400
Mingo just died!

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.815
[SABO]
Gross!

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.660
Ow, that's hot!
It's really working!

00:04:23.694 --> 00:04:27.400
Ace! I take your ability!

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.346
No way!

00:04:35.685 --> 00:04:39.358
[SABO]
Fire... Fist!

00:04:46.907 --> 00:04:49.211

The Chief of Staff of the
Revolutionary Army, Sabo!"

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.560
He broke apart the whole ring.

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:17.033
Who are you?

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:27.689
I got in touch with Hack!

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:29.960
He's waiting for us,
let's hurry!

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:31.028
[SABO]
Works for me!

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:40.280
[TOYS, DWARVES]
Usopp the God! Usopp the God!

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:43.119
[chanting continues]

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.120
We will follow your
command, God Usopp!

00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:03.561
Anything!
Just tell us what to do!

00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:07.969
Uh... Well, uh, in that case...

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:11.375
Why don't you all destroy
the factory behind me

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:14.315
and rescue our little friends?

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:16.452
[TOYS cheering]

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:30.748
Be careful!

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.251
Now that you've eaten
a Devil Fruit,

00:06:32.284 --> 00:06:33.787
sea water weakens you.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.989
Right, thanks.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.539
[TOY MAN A] Let us show
gratitude and grant our savior's

00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.414
[yelling continues]

00:06:57.802 --> 00:06:59.171
Get back here!

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:00.975
Don't touch that factory!

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:12.766
I've got no choice!

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.802
It's about to get messy!

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:23.486
[USOPP grunting]

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.490
Rest well, hero.

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:28.697
Completing this task
is our honor.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.866
That's great.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.937
Can ya...

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.372
...put me down, then?

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:36.646
This way!

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:40.821
[SABO]
Sorry!

00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:45.063
It's them.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.632
What the hell?
I thought Lucy was Straw Hat!

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:05.403
I was supposed to be the one
to eat the Flame-Flame fruit!

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:08.343
Just great!

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.248
Now how am I supposed to
break this news to Doffy?

[TOYS yelling]

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:17.795
[DIAMANTE]
What do these goons want?

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:20.702
Get him!
He works for Doflamingo!

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:23.373
We're gonna break every
bone in your body!

00:08:23.406 --> 00:08:26.613
[TOY MAN D] Annihilate him
and then the factory!

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:29.151
I see, So are these
the toy people?

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:44.481
[HACK]
Hey! Over here!

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.958
Hi, Hack! Feels like it's been
ages since I last saw you.

00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:50.293
Crazy!

00:08:50.326 --> 00:08:54.402
Oh? What happened to your hand?

00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:57.642
Oh, uh... I just fell down!

00:08:57.675 --> 00:09:01.482
You fell? Really? You lying?

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:05.356
Huh? Why would I lie about
something so trite, huh?

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:06.526
[KOALA chuckles]

00:09:10.802 --> 00:09:12.270
I can't believe it.

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:15.745
This place has been
here this whole time.

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:17.081
[KOALA]
By the way, here's your clothes!

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.415
[SABO]
Oh, thanks.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.004
[SABO]
Yikes.

00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:32.143
Well, this is gonna be something
fun to get used to.

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:34.882
Hey, um...

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:36.653
[BARTOLOMEO] Please don't take
this as criticism but that

00:09:36.687 --> 00:09:38.724
was kinda messed up, sir!

00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:41.195
I know I can make
barriers and all.

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:44.334
But that doesn't mean
that I'm invincible!

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:45.871
Not that guy.

[KOALA]
Huh?

00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:51.182
Who are you?

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:52.785
Come out and say it already.

00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:55.456
[SABO]
Me?

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:07.247
The name is Sabo.

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:17.133
We're members of the
Revolutionary Army.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.369
That's who you are?

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:29.759
Then... The first Lucy is too?

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.865
No, but we're both enemies
of the World Government.

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:35.805
That man will be the King
of the Pirates someday.

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.309
His name is Straw Hat Luffy.

00:10:38.343 --> 00:10:39.646
A pirate?

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:43.219
Yup! And he's my brother.
Surprised?

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.974
Crazy, huh?

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.443
And he's a helluva guy.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:03.828
[LUFFY]
You're gonna be pirates?

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.231
And you've got hidden
treasure already?

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.269
I'm gonna be a pirate too!

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.573
It's funny, he hasn't
changed a bit.

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:46.980
[ACE]
Well, we'll figure it out

00:11:47.014 --> 00:11:48.382
when the time comes.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.853
Maybe we'll leave on
one ship and maybe

00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:51.221
we'll leave on three.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.061
[LUFFY]
Ooh!

00:11:54.094 --> 00:11:55.664
You stole that from Dadan, huh?

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:58.068
Lemme tell you guys a secret.

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:04.014
All it takes to become brothers
is to share some sake!

00:12:04.047 --> 00:12:07.019
Whoa, really? That's so cool!

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:09.458
[ACE] We may sail in different
seas with different crews

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.429
on different ships.

00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:13.633
But wherever we go
and whatever adventures

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.138
we have,
we'll always be brothers,

00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:18.442
and nobody can take that away.

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:24.589
From now on, we're honest
to goodness brothers.

00:12:24.622 --> 00:12:25.857
Cheers to that!

00:12:32.605 --> 00:12:34.107
[GROUP]
Brothers!

00:12:43.794 --> 00:12:45.497
[SABO]
He's still the same kid.

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:46.933
Reckless as hell.

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:48.904
That's funny since I
can say the same thing

00:12:48.938 --> 00:12:50.040
about you.

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:51.408
Hey now.

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:52.978
[HACK chuckles]

00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:55.350
Well, give me some credit.

00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:56.787
I usually think things through.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.055
What's that mean?

00:12:58.088 --> 00:12:59.859
Luffy is the kinda guy
who only follows

00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:01.428
his gut instincts.

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:03.365
I fail to see the difference.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:06.239
So, wait, what brought you
guys to Dressrosa?

00:13:06.272 --> 00:13:07.306
Tell me.

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:20.400
[REBECCA]
Weapons?

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.638
[SABO]
This place is exporting firearms

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:24.909
that are contributing to
wars around the world.

00:13:27.413 --> 00:13:30.721
We're here to put
a stop to that.

00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:35.997
On several occasions,
the Revolutionary Army

00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:39.304
has sent operatives
to this kingdom.

00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:41.475
However, since they
were turned into toys,

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:43.647
none of them ever returned.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.416
Which is why we
were unable to gather

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:46.652
enough evidence.

00:13:50.528 --> 00:13:53.465
[QUIXOTE PIRATE A] That guy in
blue's gonna be a problem.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.369
[QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Yeah, that's Sabo, right?

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:58.242
What's the number 2 of the
Revolutionary Army doing here?

00:13:58.276 --> 00:13:59.979
We have to warn the crew!

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.188
It seems they're
manufacturing the weapons

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:05.489
elsewhere though.

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:08.963
But where?

00:14:08.997 --> 00:14:11.068
Who's producing
all these firearms?

00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:17.314
If we can uncover the truth,

00:14:17.347 --> 00:14:19.084
we'll have something
substantial to bring back

00:14:19.118 --> 00:14:20.219
to Dragon.

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:40.761
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:14:59.966 --> 00:15:02.805
Ahh! Things are getting
way too messy for me!

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:07.113
Issho Sir!
How should we handle this?

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:19.506
Stay down!

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.862
[ZORO] I guess things are
starting to heat up down there.

00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.197
I hope they don't need a hand.

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:52.705
Well, whatever.

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:54.609
I gotta find that rock guy.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:55.844
What a pain.

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:06.599
Pardon me!
But I must hastily proceed!

00:16:07.702 --> 00:16:08.870
Not today!

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:12.143
Huh? What is going on here?

turning us into toy slaves!

out of this place alive!

See you in hell, Doflamingo!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.458
[TOY MAN E]
He's gone?

[TOY MAN H]
What the--?

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:40.734
He couldn't have run away!

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:43.874
Damn it! Where'd that
gaudy bastard run off to?

00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:46.646
[TOY MAN J] He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.149

[KIN'EMON] I quite
literally dodged a bullet.

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:07.053
I was under the impression this
was the enemy's stronghold.

00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:09.491
Why would they
target their boss?

00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:11.428
Could it be...

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:13.700
...that Operation S.O.P.
was a success

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.203
and those angry
guys were all toys

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:16.706
that were turned back to normal?

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:18.276
You're certain that
they've accomplished

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:21.582
their objective, then?
These are good tidings, indeed!

00:17:21.616 --> 00:17:24.120
[laughing]

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:27.761
You'd should take your
disguise off quickly,

00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:29.665
or else they might try
to attack you again!

00:17:29.698 --> 00:17:31.802
[KIN'EMON]
Oh! Excellent suggestion!

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:37.113
And poof!

00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:42.858
Kanjuro!

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.664
I am on my way to assist you!

00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:49.470
[ROBIN]
Koala!

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:53.279
Robin!

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:55.282
I thought I recognized
you back there!

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:56.686
Have you been well?

00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:58.757
Yeah!

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.226
[ROBIN]
Sabo! Hack!

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.963
You haven't changed a bit.

00:18:01.997 --> 00:18:02.998
Hey!

00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:09.912
It's Miss Robin!

00:18:12.584 --> 00:18:13.920
[ROBIN]
Run into Luffy yet?

00:18:16.425 --> 00:18:17.728
He okay?

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:19.197
[ROBIN]
Mm-hmm.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.135
This guy is one
of our crewmates.

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:22.270
He's Usopp.

00:18:22.303 --> 00:18:25.142
[USOPP groaning]

00:18:25.176 --> 00:18:27.347
[SABO]
He should probably rest.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.550
[BARTOLOMEO]
What?!

00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:32.223
Usopp's a crew member?
That doesn't sound right at all.

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.928
I don't remember his name
on their wanted posters.

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:46.184
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.073
He's Sniper King, isn't he?!

00:18:59.178 --> 00:19:00.980
Cool it. You weirdo.

00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:06.892
[QUIXOTE PIRATES yelling]

00:19:11.536 --> 00:19:13.239
You'll pay!

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:15.376
How dare you kill
the Young Master!

00:19:16.947 --> 00:19:19.551
I'll blow you away!

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:31.809
[BUFFALO yelling]

00:19:34.749 --> 00:19:37.386
Buffalo! I'll kill you!

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:44.835
[BABY 5]
Damn it!

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.410
[BABY 5 yells]

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.535
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:20:03.339 --> 00:20:05.442
I'm here to save you!

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:06.512
[BABY 5]
Straw Hat?

00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:08.416
Oh, good! You didn't die!

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:10.252
I thought we agreed
you'd destroy the factory,

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.488
Straw Hat.

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.827
Did you? Or not?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.898
Here's the keys
to his handcuffs.

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.235
Wow! You're ready
for anything, aren't ya?

00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:21.007
[GLADIUS]
Wait, Straw Hat! Violet!

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.145
I won't let you
lay a finger on--

00:20:26.852 --> 00:20:28.188
Young Master?

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:34.433
[GLADIUS]
Who did this?

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:38.977
There, King Riku.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.315
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:42.417
Just a sec!

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.756
I'm gonna get you
outta here, 'kay?

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:46.525
Thanks, but I'll pass.

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:50.601
Our alliance from here
on out is terminated.

00:20:50.634 --> 00:20:51.937
So get lost!

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.174
Huh? You're so selfish!

00:20:54.207 --> 00:20:57.146
I wanna keep working
with you, so deal with it!

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.050
Who's the selfish one now?

00:20:59.084 --> 00:21:00.285
Hurry! Use the key!

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:01.454
Oh, right.

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:07.400
You do realize with
the alliance called off,

00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:08.468
we're enemies?

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:11.241
If you set me free,
I'll kill you.

00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:12.845
That's it!

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:14.615
This is hard enough
to unlock with this dumb

00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:17.120
Sea Prism Stone,
so stop squirming!

00:21:17.153 --> 00:21:18.322
Steady!

00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:20.627
You two aren't paying attention
to me at all, are you?

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:24.969
This sucks! I quit!

00:21:25.003 --> 00:21:25.971
Why don't you do it?

00:21:26.004 --> 00:21:27.373
I can't touch it either!

00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:29.578
I ate a Devil Fruit,
same as you!

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:33.653
[DOFLAMINGO laughing]

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.571
[laughing continues]

00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:53.058
[GROUP yells]

00:21:55.396 --> 00:21:56.733
It's the wall guy!

00:21:56.766 --> 00:21:57.934
Pica!

00:22:01.008 --> 00:22:04.181
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:06.217
What a way to go, huh?

00:22:06.251 --> 00:22:08.422
That was a surprise.

00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:10.492
Wait, Mingo is alive?

00:22:10.526 --> 00:22:11.729
Young Master!

00:22:11.762 --> 00:22:12.797
[GLADIUS]
You're alive!

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:17.139
How is this possible?

00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:19.010
The whole country
should be spiraling

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:23.051
into chaos now that all
the toys have been freed.

00:22:23.084 --> 00:22:25.122
[TOYS yelling]

00:22:28.863 --> 00:22:30.868
[DOFLAMINGO]
And for whatever reason,

00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:33.339
we have some members
of the Revolutionary Army

00:22:33.372 --> 00:22:34.875
nosing around too.

00:22:37.313 --> 00:22:41.187
It's a sad state of affairs
at the Royal Palace,

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.624
don't you think?

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:53.011
I'm left in a
difficult position.

00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:56.184
I have no other choice but
to use "The Birdcage."

00:22:57.486 --> 00:22:58.789
The Birdcage?

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.431
[DOFLAMINGO]
You remember, don't you, Law?

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:18.395
[NARRATOR] Luffy leaps into
action to battle Doflamingo.

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:21.167
Seemingly rising from
the dead, the despotic ruler

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.573
carries out a twisted plan
to hide the true history

00:23:23.606 --> 00:23:24.808
of Dressrosa.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:26.278
Spreading fear and chaos,

00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:28.081
he threatens to
eradicate the kingdom

00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.518
and everyone in it.

00:23:29.552 --> 00:23:31.321
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.354 --> 00:23:35.295
"The Devil's Trap!
A Dressrosa Extermination Plan!"

00:23:35.328 --> 00:23:37.333
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
