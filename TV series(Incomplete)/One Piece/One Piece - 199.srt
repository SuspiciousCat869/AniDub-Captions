1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:24,092 --> 00:02:25,885
[NARRATOR] The Straw
Hat Pirates have fallen

25
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,220
right into the middle of

26
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:30,598
the impenetrable Marine
fortress Navarone.

27
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:31,558
Oh, come on.

28
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:34,394
[NARRATOR]
Zoro was captured.

29
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:35,854
You stupid face!

30
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,064
[NARRATOR] Luffy and Sanji
have infiltrated the kitchen

31
00:02:38,148 --> 00:02:40,150
under the guise of
famous Marine cooks,

32
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,028
but danger draws ever closer.

33
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,827
[LUFFY]
"The Marine's Dragnet Closes In!

34
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,163
The Second Member Captured!"

35
00:03:00,295 --> 00:03:02,422
[USOPP]
Marine Command Branch 8.

36
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,882
[ROBIN]
That's the official name,

37
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,217
but it's more commonly
known as Navarone.

38
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,553
The Marines' most
powerful stronghold.

39
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:11,514
The command center is most
likely in that central tower,

40
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,807
but that's about all we know.

41
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:15,101
Enough with all the
technical talk already!

42
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,811
Aren't ancient ruins
enough for you?

43
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:19,314
Now you gotta analyze some
stupid Marine fortress?

44
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:20,732
Knowledge is power.

45
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,984
Or have you forgotten that
we're in enemy territory?

46
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,319
[USOPP]
I haven't forgotten anything,

47
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,738
but we can't just stand
around looking at stuff!

48
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:31,034
I gotta get to the Going Merry
to see if my baby's okay.

49
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,119
Merry? Merry, where are you?

50
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,038
[ROBIN] It's reasonable
to assume that the ship

51
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,331
was seized by the Marines.

52
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:37,999
[USOPP]
Why are you so calm?

53
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,751
Don't you care about our ship?

54
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,128
Even if we can find
the Going Merry,

55
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:43,963
how will we escape with it?

56
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:45,715
Do you honestly think
that the Marines

57
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,550
will simply show us the way out?

58
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:48,593
Uh, well, I...

59
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,220
Which is why we must find out

60
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:53,223
all we can about
this place, right?

61
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,184
Yeah?

62
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:58,478
I wouldn't be a pirate if I
was scared of a few Marines!

63
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,021
I'm done with this.

64
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,774
I'll leave the standing around
and looking at stuff to you.

65
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,194
My leg!

66
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,115
Huh? Hey! That really hurt!

67
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,617
[MARINE A]
Found 'em?

68
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,910
[MARINES]
No, nothing!

69
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,912
We'll capture those
filthy Straw Hat Pirates.

70
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,455
Leave no stone unturned!

71
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,165
They couldn't have gotten far.

72
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,417
[MARINES]
Sir!

73
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:24,671
There's no escaping.

74
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:28,133
We've already captured the
legendary Roronoa Zoro.

75
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:29,217
[gasps]

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,385
Z-Zoro.

77
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,220
[ROBIN]
Are you all right, Long-nose?

78
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,513
[USOPP]
Did you hear what he said?

79
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,181
[ROBIN] The Marines
seem to have realized

80
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:38,435
that the Going Merry was in fact
full of pirates, not ghosts.

81
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:39,936
Now they're angry.

82
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,022
We need to worry about our
survival instead of our ship.

83
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,898
I don't care what you
have to say anymore!

84
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,900
That ship is more precious
than life itself

85
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:47,610
and I'm gonna go in
there and get it back!

86
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:48,862
Do you hear me?

87
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,197
I've made up my mind so
just stay out of my way!

88
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,907
See you on board!

89
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,202
So stubborn.

90
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,179
[gasps]

91
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,143
[groans] I weathered
that wretched storm

92
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:22,854
to come to a backwater base
in the middle of nowhere.

93
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:26,066
And they don't have the
decency to welcome me? Hah?

94
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,859
--Hey, you! Over there!
--[MARINE E] Sir!

95
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,861
I am here to meet
this base's commander.

96
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:32,113
So inform the officer in
charge that I have arrived

97
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,407
{\an8}and wish to commence
the meeting post haste!

98
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:37,660
{\an8}Yes, sir, but... Sorry, sir.

99
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,788
{\an8}It's just I have to ask
what business you have

100
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,289
{\an8}with our commander?

101
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,875
I have no obligation to explain
anything to you, Private!

102
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,710
I'm really very sorry, sir,

103
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,295
but I also have to
confirm your rank

104
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,546
and which division
you're attached to.

105
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,007
I will explain nothing
to you, understand?

106
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,009
Now contact your
commander immediately!

107
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,094
[MARINE E]
Of course, sir.

108
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,804
But I don't think
it'll do any good.

109
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,389
And just why is that, Private?

110
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:58,765
Well, sir, this is the hour

111
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,767
that Commander Jonathan
normally takes for lunch,

112
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,019
so he's probably eating in
the dining hall right now.

113
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,188
[SHEPHERD]
So call the dining hall, dimwit!

114
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,940
But, sir, you don't
know the credo

115
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,275
of Marine Command
Branch 8, do you?

116
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,860
You have a credo?

117
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,279
Rule one! You must wash your
hands before every meal!

118
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:15,865
Rule two! Never leave any
food behind on your plate.

119
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,576
Rule three! Never mention
work in the dining hall!

120
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,578
Rule four! Always brush
your teeth aft--

121
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:21,705
Enough!

122
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:23,289
You're saying that your
commander thinks

123
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:27,168
lunch is more important than a
VIP sent by Marine headquarters?

124
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,336
Is that correct?

125
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,839
Yes! That's correct, sir!

126
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:34,300
[SHEPHERD growls]

127
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,720
I can see that you'll
be of no use to me.

128
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,388
I'll find the commander
on my own.

129
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:41,474
But before I go, I have
one piece of advice for you.

130
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,768
If I were you, I would start
thinking of ways to explain

131
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,062
this situation to
the court marshal.

132
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,982
[SHEPHERD cackles]

133
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,569
[SHEPHERD]
This sector no longer requires

134
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:54,446
the presence of this
bloated stronghold,

135
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,239
or the peculiar,
isolated commander

136
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:59,325
who refuses to step
foot outside of it.

137
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,037
The Marines don't need either
of those outdated dinosaurs,

138
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,246
and I will make
sure to note that

139
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,165
in my report to headquarters.

140
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,916
That old badger won't
be eating and fishing

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,376
on the Marine's dime for long.

142
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,837
Enjoy your last few meals
at Navarone, Commander!

143
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,882
For soon, you will be
relieved of your duties here!

144
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,343
[SHEPHERD]
Hm?

145
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,353
Guess it was nothing.

146
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:28,104
[SHEPHERD]
Hm?

147
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:34,235
[gasping, groaning]

148
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:43,620
[ROBIN] Marine headquarters
inspection division.

149
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:46,122
You'll do just fine, Inspector.

150
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,291
[ROBIN chuckles]

151
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,045
Oh! So good!

152
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:53,755
This new cook is
totally awesome!

153
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,340
Amazing! It tastes even better

154
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:57,008
than the guys from the
morning crew said it would!

155
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,552
All right! The next
100 are waiting!

156
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,054
Hurry up and finish!

157
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,139
[MARINES]
Aye aye, sir!

158
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,558
[JESSICA]
Here you go.

159
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,520
Uh, Jessica?

160
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:11,356
This is the same dish you always
prepare for me, isn't it?

161
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,608
It sure is. Is there a problem?

162
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,026
Well, my men keep carrying on

163
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,736
about the incredible
food prepared by

164
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,363
the new cooks from Marie Jois.

165
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:20,490
Don't get me wrong,
I love your cooking.

166
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,867
But I'd really like to try
something from these new guys.

167
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,703
Oh, you're saying
you don't like it.

168
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:26,329
The head chef herself personally

169
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:27,997
took the time to
prepare a meal for you,

170
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,249
and you don't like it?

171
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,418
Would you rather eat the
same food as the grunts?

172
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,128
I'll have you know that
this meal was made

173
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,879
with love and care just for you.

174
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,716
I really appreciate the
love and care in my meal,

175
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,011
but I don't so much like
the broccoli and carrots.

176
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,179
Have you forgotten
our base's credo?

177
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,265
No. I'm eating, see?

178
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,891
It's good! Mmm!

179
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:49,019
[JESSICA chuckles]

180
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,396
[LUFFY] Whoa! It's like a
buffet of deliciousness!

181
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,565
Keep up the good work, guys!
You're doing great!

182
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,941
[SHINPACHI]
What's up with that other guy?

183
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:57,485
He's just been inhaling
the food nonstop.

184
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,403
Don't mind him.

185
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,988
His job is taste testing.

186
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,865
[SHINPACHI] It doesn't look to
me like he's tasting anything,

187
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,783
and he sure isn't
a very good cook.

188
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,744
You on the other hand
are clearly a master,

189
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:07,078
a true talent,

190
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,246
and you're getting very
popular among the troops.

191
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:09,497
Hey, thank you.

192
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,291
I'll be sure to write
down some of my recipes.

193
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:13,084
I have an order for table eight.

194
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,210
And make it snappy!

195
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:17,172
Aye aye, sir!

196
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,840
For a woman that
strong and beautiful,

197
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,926
I'd go through any culinary
torture to make her happy.

198
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,761
Done!

199
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,721
[COOKS]
So fast!

200
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:26,890
Hey! Looks good!

201
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll be happy to
take that for you!

202
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,602
Hold it! If you
touch any of that,

203
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:32,771
you'll be eating the rest
of your meals in the brig!

204
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,356
Yeah, yeah, no problem!

205
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,191
Did he hear anything
I just said?

206
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,318
Who is this guy at table eight?

207
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,653
Jessica sure seems concerned
about what he's eating.

208
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,197
She's always pretty wound up,

209
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,407
but it gets even worse when it
comes to her husband's food.

210
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,618
My sweet Jessica's
a married woman?

211
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,995
No time for chitchatting,
get back to work!

212
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,664
Her husband is definitely
the luckiest guy in Navarone,

213
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,166
maybe even the world.

214
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:56,461
[SHINPACHI] She's married to
the commander of this place.

215
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,338
He's the commander?

216
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,091
Wait, Luffy.

217
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:09,974
Eat up!

218
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:11,726
Thank you. You're dismissed.

219
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,396
Right. Aye aye, sir!

220
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:26,658
[JONATHAN] Outstanding. It's
everything they said it was!

221
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,371
[JONATHAN] It's surpassed
all my expectations!

222
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:32,997
[LUFFY]
Mine, too!

223
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:36,960
[JONATHAN]
Hm?

224
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:57,022
[LUFFY grunting]

225
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:59,774
I just want a meatball,
you selfish jerk!

226
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,777
I see you've finally
decided to show your face!

227
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,117
[LUFFY]
Mmm.

228
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,288
Dammit, I'm already too late!

229
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,082
[JONATHAN]
Welcome, Straw Hat Luffy.

230
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:16,916
[LUFFY]
Hm?

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,626
I am Commander Jonathan,

232
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,172
Chief Officer of G8,
your sworn enemy.

233
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,820
Straw Hat Luffy.

234
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:47,447
I would rather not
resort to violence

235
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,282
in the dining hall,
so please be civil.

236
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:51,993
Just answer me one question
if you would be so kind.

237
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:55,163
If I answer it, can I
split that food with you?

238
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:57,707
If you answer the question,
you can have all of it.

239
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,376
[LUFFY]
Really? You got a deal!

240
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,919
Sorry I called you a jerk!

241
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,921
You idiot! Hurry up
and get outta there!

242
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,547
[JONATHAN]
No matter how hard I try,

243
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,758
I can't figure out
your purpose here.

244
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,094
I am certain that
Captain Smoker is the one

245
00:12:09,177 --> 00:12:11,388
who defeated Crocodile
and in Alabasta,

246
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:14,516
your shenanigans resulted
in no discernable gain.

247
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:17,185
They acquired you neither
fame nor fortune.

248
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,770
Your motives remain a mystery,

249
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:21,940
and I want to know why it is you
came to Navarone of all places.

250
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:23,483
[LUFFY] That's easy!
We fell from the sky!

251
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,485
This is just where we landed.

252
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,653
Here in the Grand Line

253
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:28,863
it's just one crazy
thing after another.

254
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:31,783
I gotta say I'm really starting
to like this fortress.

255
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,411
The food here is great.

256
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,246
[JONATHAN chuckles]

257
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:37,414
[JONATHAN]
You should know that

258
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:38,832
even with the power
of the Devil Fruit,

259
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,250
one will find that
escape from our

260
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,627
charming little fortress
is impossible.

261
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:45,046
It would take nothing
short of a miracle.

262
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,423
Checkmate!

263
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:48,758
I'll leave when I'm good
and ready, Mister Commander!

264
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,093
[chuckles]

265
00:12:50,176 --> 00:12:51,469
I doubt you'll talk so tough

266
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,513
when you hear that
we've captured Zoro.

267
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,473
Huh? Zoro?

268
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,017
That idiot!

269
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,228
All right, fortress guy.

270
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,604
Where's Zoro?

271
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,689
[JONATHAN]
Why do you ask?

272
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:03,982
Well, why do think?

273
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,191
So I can find him

274
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,568
and rescue my friend!

275
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,111
Don't be so hasty.

276
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,238
You'll be joining the
swordsman soon enough.

277
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,991
I'll make sure of that.

278
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,701
[BOTH gasp]

279
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:16,703
[LUFFY gasps]

280
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:17,954
[JONATHAN]
Hm?

281
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,123
You'll blow our cover!
We gotta get outta here!

282
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,207
[SANJI gasps]

283
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,461
Jessica.

284
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,463
Such a shame for someone
with skills like yours

285
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:29,007
to waste their life as a
filthy Straw Hat Pirate!

286
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,633
Give up while you
still can, pirates!

287
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,094
The cooks of Navarone are even
tougher than the soldiers!

288
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:34,262
Heh. Bring it on.

289
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,805
I come from cooks that
make you look like

290
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,974
schoolgirls playing house!

291
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:41,019
[SANJI] But still.
I can't attack Jessica.

292
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,896
What are we gonna do?

293
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:46,775
[JONATHAN grunts]

294
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,329
[MARINE I]
Man, I am starving!

295
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:00,914
[MARINE J]
Time to eat!

296
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,291
[MARINE K] I wanna try some
of that fancy new food!

297
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,292
[MARINE L]
Bring on the grub!

298
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,502
[JESSICA]
No! We almost had them!

299
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:06,836
[SANJI]
Now's our chance!

300
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,879
Straw Hat!

301
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,841
[LUFFY]
See ya 'round, fortress guy!

302
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,636
[OFFICER B] Our enemy
is the Straw Hat Pirates.

303
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:17,555
You must be prepared to engage
them at a moment's notice!

304
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,140
For the honor of Navarone,

305
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:22,602
we must capture and deal with
them swiftly and without mercy!

306
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,978
[MARINES]
Sir!

307
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,773
[USOPP] These Marines
are really fired up!

308
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,066
I won't last long if I try to

309
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,568
play hide and seek
with these animals!

310
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,697
[USOPP] Subterfuge
is key. Yeah that's it.

311
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,156
I gotta blend in.

312
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,034
Well, what have we here? Ha, ha!

313
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,577
Transformation complete!

314
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:40,745
Now I'll be able to--

315
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,163
--[MARINE M] Hold it!
--[USOPP squeals]

316
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:47,460
As a Navarone Marine,

317
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,337
you will follow the
dress code to the "t."

318
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,673
Even your collar
is important, Private.

319
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:53,591
Don't ever forget that again.

320
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,386
[USOPP gasps]
My apologies, sir!

321
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,013
I assure you it
won't happen again!

322
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,931
By the way, could you
tell me how to get the dock

323
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,224
where the Straw Hat's ship is?

324
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:03,518
I'm new here so I'm kinda lost.

325
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,146
The docks are on the lower level
about six blocks down.

326
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,398
[USOPP] Thank you, sir! And I
really appreciate the guidance!

327
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,441
Wait! That dock is--

328
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,859
[USOPP]
Don't worry! I'll find it!

329
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,278
Oh, Merry!

330
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,071
You're really okay!

331
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,197
[MECHAO]
A fine boat.

332
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,324
Carvel model with a lateen sail

333
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:21,119
and an axial stern rudder
right down the center.

334
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,204
It's an older model,
but it can hold it's own

335
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,414
with the best of 'em.

336
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:25,790
Hey! Who are you?

337
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,709
[MECHAO] You don't know me?
You must be a rookie.

338
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,252
Uh, yeah.

339
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,087
[MECHAO] From the looks of it,
she's seen her share of action.

340
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,297
She's covered in patches,

341
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,758
but you can tell they
were expertly done.

342
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,843
Yep. This ship is truly loved.

343
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,595
So you can tell that
by looking at her?

344
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:39,929
Makes no difference to me

345
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:41,931
if it's a Marine ship
or a pirate ship.

346
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,224
I can tell at a glance

347
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,353
whether or not a boat has
gotten the proper TLC.

348
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,189
That means so much!
Thanks, old man!

349
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:50,857
[MECHAO] Well, I wasn't
complimenting you!

350
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,400
No, but I like the sound of it.

351
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,443
Is that so wrong?

352
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:54,944
You're a strange one,
aren't you?

353
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:56,696
[DRAKE]
You haven't changed a bit.

354
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,492
Still trying to compare pirate
junk to real Marine ships.

355
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,118
[MECHAO]
Lt. Commander, if you're here

356
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:04,788
about the ship repairs,
it'll be at least another week.

357
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,498
It seems that Marines
these days are

358
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:07,916
under the mistaken
impression that

359
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:10,335
ruining perfectly good
ships is their job.

360
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,795
Thanks to that,
the repair schedule

361
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:12,837
is completely packed.

362
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,172
[DRAKE]
Stand down, old-timer.

363
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,715
I didn't come here
to bother you.

364
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,550
I'm here to talk to your
new friend over there.

365
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,385
Hey, you!

366
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:19,219
[USOPP gasps]
Yes, sir!

367
00:16:19,302 --> 00:16:20,387
What unit are you with?

368
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,013
[USOPP sputtering]

369
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,973
Did you forget which
unit you're in?

370
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,309
Uh, I think I'm pretty
sure it's unit 18, sir.

371
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:29,604
Of course, unit 18. That's
the sniper unit, isn't it?

372
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,523
Don't you idiots know
that this dock is

373
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:34,567
off limits to everyone except
for maintenance personnel?

374
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:36,277
Well, we snipers
are a forgetful type.

375
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,487
So sorry,
it'll never happen again.

376
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,321
I'll just be on my...

377
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,073
That's not necessary!

378
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:41,241
[USOPP]
It's not?

379
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:42,826
[DRAKE]
Arrest him.

380
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,077
[USOPP shrieks]

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,829
But I just want to get
back to my unit, sir!

382
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:49,290
It was reported to me that a
suspicious new recruit was seen.

383
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,625
And by the way,

384
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,628
unit 18 isn't a sniper unit,
it's a supply unit.

385
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,548
That's right! My bad!
I'm in a supply unit!

386
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,092
[MECHAO] Stop this immediately,
you brainless jackals!

387
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:00,301
Don't you know where you are?

388
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,262
For the dockworkers,
this place is holy!

389
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:04,597
If you shed even a single
drop of his blood here,

390
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:06,683
I'll make sure you regret it.

391
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:13,940
Put your swords down.

392
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,483
We'll take him to
the command center.

393
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,568
[MARINES]
Sir!

394
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,364
[JONATHAN]
Hmm. Is this him?

395
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:22,657
[DRAKE]
Commander.

396
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,744
The suspect insists
that he is a Marine.

397
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,787
But all of our evidence
indicates otherwise.

398
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,914
I think he's another one
of the Straw Hats.

399
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,208
[JONATHAN]
Hmm.

400
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,376
--You there.
--[USOPP gasps]

401
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,836
What's your name?

402
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:36,921
What's your name?

403
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,173
It's--

404
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,174
It's classified?

405
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,800
And your unit?

406
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:41,634
It's classified.

407
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:42,844
Why did you go to the dock

408
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,804
where the pirate ship
was impounded?

409
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,306
It's classified.

410
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:48,391
"It's classified."

411
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:49,476
[USOPP]
Uh-huh.

412
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,643
[DRAKE]
I say we throw him in the brig

413
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:51,853
and put the thumbscrews on him.

414
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:53,313
Hold on, Lieutenant.

415
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:54,272
But--!

416
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,690
[JONATHAN]
Come to think of it,

417
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,942
I heard that a special inspector
from Marine Headquarters

418
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,487
was supposed to arrive on
the Stan Marey this morning.

419
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,321
What?

420
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,864
A special inspector?

421
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,324
[DRAKE]
Commander!

422
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,784
[JONATHAN]
If he is an inspector,

423
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,660
then it's only natural
that he wouldn't be able to

424
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,455
reveal his name or what
unit he's attached to.

425
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,706
[DRAKE]
That's ridiculous.

426
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,874
An idiot like him--

427
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:15,460
[USOPP laughs]
So, you've figured it out.

428
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:16,836
Huh?

429
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,004
[USOPP] You should be proud
of yourself, Commander.

430
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,340
I am the special inspector
from Marine HQ,

431
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,633
but you can call me...

432
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:23,385
...Inspector Usopp!

433
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,222
Is there any illegal
activity in G8?

434
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,599
Are all military rules and
regulations being followed?

435
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,643
How is the morale for
the troops on base?

436
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,061
In order to answer
these questions,

437
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,313
I infiltrated the
base as a grunt.

438
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,023
And there you have it!

439
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,942
[MARINES]
We're sorry, Inspector Usopp!

440
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,527
This is insanity!

441
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,696
If he really is a
special inspector,

442
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,656
then that means he has higher
rank and more authority

443
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:45,824
than we do!

444
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,034
This man cannot be
higher ranking than me!

445
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:50,787
This man? This man?

446
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,872
What exactly are you
trying to say, Drake?

447
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:55,291
Have you forgotten that
you are only lieutenant?

448
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,127
You know, I've got
friends in high places.

449
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,420
I could have you court-martialed

450
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,630
for insulting a
superior officer.

451
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,799
How about it? Do you want
to have your next meal

452
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:05,343
in some wretched Marine
prison cell? Heh, heh.

453
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:06,970
--[DRAKE gasps]
--[USOPP chuckling]

454
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:08,888
[JONATHAN] Sorry for the
misunderstanding, Inspector.

455
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,349
I was just about to send
someone down to greet you.

456
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,518
Please, accept my apologies.

457
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:16,980
[USOPP] Of course, Commander,
everyone makes mistakes!

458
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:18,982
Commander! Special
Inspector Major Shepherd

459
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,692
from Marine Headquarters
has just arrived

460
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,068
and is requesting a meeting!

461
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:23,361
[USOPP screams]
The real one showed up?!

462
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,946
I knew it!

463
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,449
How dare you!

464
00:19:27,532 --> 00:19:29,909
--[USOPP] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
--You ass!

465
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,829
[USOPP]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

466
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:34,289
I'm really very sorry.

467
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:37,083
[DRAKE] Are you apologizing?
I can't hear you!

468
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,627
Commander, pleased to
make your acquaintance.

469
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,670
Yeah, I bet you're sorry!

470
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:41,880
[USOPP]
Robin?

471
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,132
...apologizing in prison!

472
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,718
[USOPP] Looks like Robin
got a disguise, too!

473
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,429
Yeah, you're not so cocky now,
are you? You little twerp!

474
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,056
[USOPP]
Oh, hey there, fellow inspector!

475
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,558
Fancy meeting you here!

476
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,435
You know me, right?
I'm from your division!

477
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,687
It's me, Inspector Usopp,
remember?

478
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,440
Did you forget me because
you've been traveling so much?

479
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,984
Major Shepherd,
do you know this man?

480
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,194
No, sir, I do not.

481
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:05,445
[USOPP screams]

482
00:20:05,528 --> 00:20:06,613
I knew it!

483
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,074
Don't act like you
don't know me! [screams]

484
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,117
[DRAKE]
Lock him up, men!

485
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:13,703
I will begin by investigating
the structural qualities

486
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:14,954
of this base.

487
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:16,831
Of course. Be my guest, Major.

488
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,500
If you need anything, just ask.

489
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,585
Thank you very much.

490
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,756
[USOPP]
Stupid Robin!

491
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,591
Does she suddenly hate
me now or something?

492
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,052
She just flat out
stabbed me in the back!

493
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,470
That's messed up, right, Zoro?

494
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:31,846
She ratted me out!

495
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,807
If she had only gone
along with what I said,

496
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,518
we probably would have had
the Merry back by now!

497
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,561
You should be more
grateful to Robin.

498
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:39,979
[USOPP]
Grateful? Why?

499
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,648
Why should I be grateful to her?

500
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,233
'Cause it means
you're with me now.

501
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:44,818
[gasps] I see.

502
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:47,779
Robin knew that I would really
be safer here with you.

503
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:51,282
She was thinking of my
well being all along.

504
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,328
But still.

505
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:58,707
This place doesn't
seem that safe.

506
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,252
[ROBIN] Perhaps I shouldn't have
started researching this base.

507
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,964
We may have had a chance
for a clean escape earlier.

508
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,175
Looks like there's only
one way out of this place.

509
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,555
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

510
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,390
Where are you, Zoro?

511
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,683
Come out, come out...

512
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,561
Shut up, will ya?
You're gonna get us caught!

513
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:20,770
This way!

514
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,189
[MARINE R]
So far we've captured Zoro,

515
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:25,400
and another man with
a really long nose!

516
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,068
[MARINE R] Straw hat Luffy
and the rest of his crew

517
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,153
have got to be close.

518
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,529
Find them!

519
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,864
[MARINES]
Sir!

520
00:21:33,283 --> 00:21:35,618
Well, what do we
do now, Captain?

521
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:40,123
[JONATHAN] Straw Hat Luffy
and a very skilled cook.

522
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:43,418
A warrior and a man
with a long nose.

523
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:46,588
A doctor and a nurse
we've yet to see.

524
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,885
[JONATHAN] And one more, who
calls herself Major Shepherd.

525
00:21:57,307 --> 00:22:00,018
[JONATHAN]
That makes seven crewmembers.

526
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,937
It's all starting to make sense.

527
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,025
[JONATHAN]
We've already captured the ship

528
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,402
as well as two
members of the crew.

529
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:13,073
The remaining Straw Hats
are within our reach.

530
00:22:13,156 --> 00:22:16,785
So what is your next move,
Monkey D. Luffy?

531
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,789
I suppose I'll have to sit
back and see for myself.

532
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:26,002
[JONATHAN chuckling]

533
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>A future lies before us</i>
<i>waiting to begin</i>

534
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:42,852
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

535
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:47,065
<i>and search the world for answers</i>

536
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:51,444
<i>to all the questions</i>
<i>in our minds</i>

537
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:55,907
<i>Exploring day and night we'll...</i>

538
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,954
<i>...live out our</i>
<i>dreams in paradise!</i>

539
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,623
<i>And that's why...</i>

540
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:06,668
<i>We're running, and running,</i>

541
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,671
<i>traveling along an open road</i>

542
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,966
<i>Never letting go of</i>
<i>what we came to do</i>

543
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>We're here to see this through!</i>

544
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,513
<i>We can't lose, can't lose,</i>

545
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,474
<i>nothing on earth</i>
<i>can stop us now</i>

546
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:24,894
<i>'Cause we're not afraid</i>
<i>of our own destiny</i>

547
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:31,568
<i>We Dream and live</i>
<i>our lives free!</i>

548
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,081
[USOPP] Luffy! We're
right here, come and get us!

549
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:46,416
I mean wait! I changed my mind!

550
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,917
Zoro, what should I say?

551
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,044
[ZORO]
How should I know?

552
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,462
Tell them to come,
or not, or whatever.

553
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,379
[USOPP]
Well that's just not--

554
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,547
[LUFFY]
Don't worry, guys.

555
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,007
I'll be there in a j--

556
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,675
in a j-jiffy.

557
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,885
[USOPP]
What the? I see what those

558
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,261
Sea Prism Stones are doing!

559
00:23:58,345 --> 00:23:59,596
[SANJI]
Oh, no! It's a trap!

560
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,431
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

561
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:04,184
"Luffy and Sanji's
Daring Rescue Mission!"

562
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,936
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
