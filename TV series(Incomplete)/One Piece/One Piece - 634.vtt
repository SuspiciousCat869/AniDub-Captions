00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.016
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.638
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.911
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.152
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.191
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.501
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.136
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.127
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.198
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.469
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:24.208
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:27.314
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:30.053
Hoping to create a distraction,
they arrange a trade

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:32.023
with the country's
king, Doflamingo.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:33.961
But after Zoro's
sword is stolen,

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.334
the crew becomes hopelessly
separated in the vast city.

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:40.708
When Luffy finds out that Ace's
Flame Flame Fruit is the prize

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.714
in a gladiator tournament
at the Corrida Colosseum,

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:46.052
he decides to enter
and win it for himself.

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:48.023
But it turns out that
some of the world's most

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:50.928
ferocious fighters had
the exact same idea.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:53.066
Ah! You over there.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.335
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:55.838
Nice ensemble.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.143
[CAVENDISH]
Alas, there is a weight limit

00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:00.414
for gear, I'm afraid.

00:04:00.447 --> 00:04:02.919
A limit? Well that kinda sucks.

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:04.656
[CAVENDISH] All the weapons
and armor in the world

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:05.859
won't help you.

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:09.365
There's only one who deserves
the Flame Flame Fruit.

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.601
Me!

00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:13.173
Such beautiful power
is wasted on you.

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:16.045
It's only fit for someone
equally as stunning!

00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:31.943
[CAVENDISH] My name's Cavendish,
and the pleasure's all yours.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.551
I'm sure that you
already knew who I am.

00:04:35.585 --> 00:04:39.459
After all, everyone's heard of
the gallant noble pirate.

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:41.564
Fame comes with these looks.

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:43.099
Look at that hair!

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.807
Seeing him in person
is way too much for me!

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.844
[ATTENDANT B]
My heart! It wasn't ready!

00:04:48.877 --> 00:04:50.080
It wasn't ready!

00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:52.350
[chuckles] It's almost sinful,

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:56.459
but I can't really help
being this beautiful, can I?

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:57.762
Like this radiant rose,

00:04:57.795 --> 00:04:59.967
my perfection is
a universal truth.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.037
A masterpiece of nature.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.543
I've been given everything
throughout my life.

00:05:04.576 --> 00:05:06.713
Handed to me
on a silver platter.

00:05:06.746 --> 00:05:09.619
I've had no desire to eat
a Devil Fruit until now.

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:10.888
Why would I need one

00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:13.861
when I've managed to come
this far without even trying?

00:05:13.894 --> 00:05:16.131
My looks have done it for me.

00:05:18.303 --> 00:05:19.438
[JUDGE A]
You're over the weight limit.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:20.508
Aww!

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:23.146
I told you that earlier!
Get back here!

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:26.887
Ugh. But I look
so cool like this.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.393
Is that why everyone's
runnin' around half-naked?

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:33.299
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.436
Man, they're pretty worked up!

00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:39.178
Do you know what inspires

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:42.384
such rabid excitement
within them? It's simple.

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.392
[CAVENDISH]
They want blood.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:49.633
And gladiators are nothing
more than a delivery system.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.603
It's the blood of the loser.

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.541
That is what they thirst for.

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:56.378
This colosseum.
It extracts the truth.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:06:00.120
Strips man down to his
most authentic nature.

00:06:00.153 --> 00:06:02.526
These people bottle up
their frustrations,

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.829
their fear, their anger.

00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:08.336
They force their primal,
bestial urges deep inside.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.577
But here, they're free to
let it tear out of them.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.083
They don't want a protracted
match between sword and armor.

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:18.189
This competition's more
than just a show for them.

00:06:18.222 --> 00:06:19.993
It's a release.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.565
[LUFFY] I don't hafta
take off the cape, right?

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.638
It looks so awesome on me.

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:27.107
Hey, you.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.544
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:29.980
[CAVENDISH]
I saw you earlier.

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:32.017
Watched you crush
that giant brute.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.687
Made me wonder who you are.

00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:35.691
Me? Luffy.

00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:36.660
[COMPETITORS]
What?

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:37.561
No!

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:40.333
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:44.041
It says your name's Lucy!

00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:46.178
Uh, yeah, Lucy.

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.619
Learn how to annunciate
better, ya damn dolt!

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:51.255
So, you're Lucy.

00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:52.224
[COMPETITOR U]
I almost crapped myself

00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:53.828
thinkin' Straw Hat was here.

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:55.531
[COMPETITOR V]
Who, that little shrimp?

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:58.270
I heard the real Luffy's
over twenty feet tall.

00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:00.340
This shield is awesome!

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:02.578
[CAVENDISH]
Lucky thing you're not him.

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.419
Because if you were
the real Straw Hat Luffy,

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.323
I woundn't wait for the ring.

00:07:08.356 --> 00:07:09.859
I'd kill you now.

00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:13.099
Huh? And why's that?

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:16.873
It's been three years since I
first arrived in the New World.

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:21.215
[CAVENDISH] The entire globe
was entranced by the story of

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:25.089
the beautiful rookie with a 200
million bounty on his head.

00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:27.662
I made the front
page news every day.

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:30.199
Young women went nuts
over my wanted posters

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.270
and they became
a collector's item.

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:34.342
They ripped them from
the walls of every town

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:36.846
so they could hang
them in their bedrooms.

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.489
[CAVENDISH] The world fell head
over in heels in love with me.

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.392
"There's the shining star!"

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:44.796
"Who? You mean me?"

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:47.502
"Well, who else?" [chuckles]

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:50.373
"Oh, gallant Cavendish,
please look my way!"

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:51.743
"Don't worry.

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:58.122
I will always be looking at you
in your dreams, my dear."

00:07:58.156 --> 00:08:00.962
[chuckles]

00:08:00.995 --> 00:08:04.936
But then, a single
freaking year later...

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:06.540
All anyone wanted to talk about

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.978
was the stupid war
in Marineford!

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.981
Whitebeard stole
the spotlight from me,

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:14.722
and Straw Hat Luffy stepped
into it right next to him!

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:16.225
And on top of that,

00:08:16.258 --> 00:08:18.831
adeluge of new rookies
kept pouring in!

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:21.469
Earning themselves the mantle
of the Worst Generation

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:24.040
and abducting the
public's imagination!

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:27.413
The journalists practically
forgot that I even existed!

00:08:27.447 --> 00:08:29.352
And that's why
I'm gonna kill them!

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:31.322
These unworthy usurpers!

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:32.992
They will die!

00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:35.798
I think you've got other
problems to work on, dude.

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:37.200
Say what you like.

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:40.140
To recapture the public
adoration I deserve,

00:08:40.173 --> 00:08:45.250
I will do anything it takes,
and kill every rookie there is!

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:47.421
The first step is
winning today's prize,

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:50.160
the Flame Flame Fruit. See?

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:51.495
Now you're qualified.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.732
[LUFFY]
Awesome!

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:56.172
No one will ever ignore me
again after I have won this!

00:08:56.205 --> 00:08:59.111
Bastards! The entire world
will have to acknowledge me

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:01.583
when I roast it in my flames!

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:20.253
[COMPETITOR G]
You competin', doll face?

00:09:20.286 --> 00:09:23.192
You ain't gonna last
but ya sure are cute.

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:26.600
[COMPETITOR J whistles]

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.169
[COMPETITOR W ]
Damn, talk about stuck up.

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:29.105
[COMPETITOR X]
Hey, you don't wanna

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:30.574
mess with her too much, man.

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:31.677
[COMPETITOR Y]
Why the hell not?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.880
[COMPETITOR X]
What, you really don't know?

00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:57.562
[gasps]

00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:01.168
[LUFFY]
Aww. Well that's kinda funny.

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:03.139
I wound up wearing
the same fighting costume

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:05.010
as this old guy.

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:07.114
[REBECCA]
Are you you interested in him?

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:09.452
[LUFFY]
Huh? Who're you?

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:13.193
[REBECCA] I'm Rebecca.
A gladiator here.

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:14.929
You made a fool of Spartan.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.265
I hate that guy.

00:10:16.298 --> 00:10:17.502
Thanks for that.

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.872
Eh, that jerk was askin' for it.

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:23.213
This statue before you.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.949
This man was a legend.

00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.688
[LUFFY] Whoa, really?
The giant old dude?

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:30.193
He was the greatest gladiator
in the whole history

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:33.600
of the Corrida Colosseum. Kyros.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.638
He fought three thousand matches

00:10:35.672 --> 00:10:38.009
and claimed three
thousand victories.

00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:41.583
The only wound he ever suffered
in combat was a single slash.

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:42.852
[LUFFY]
Wow! Tough!

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.055
[REBECCA]
He was still fighting here

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:46.191
until just 20 years ago.

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:51.368
Even so, he is unknown
to this country.

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.206
No one remembers a thing.

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:55.476
Huh? What do you mean?

00:10:55.511 --> 00:10:58.584
[REBECCA] None of the elders
or even the gladiators.

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:01.388
No one recalls having met him.

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:04.462
It's the most mysterious
statue in Dressrosa.

00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:07.133
He might not have existed
for all we know.

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:09.772
Someone could've
just made him up.

00:11:09.806 --> 00:11:14.515
On top of that, who knows how
long this statue has been here.

00:11:14.548 --> 00:11:16.251
All that we really
know of the man

00:11:16.285 --> 00:11:20.092
is what someone engraved
on this placard here.

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:22.197
Even though we don't
know who he is,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.470
nobody wants to
remove the statue.

00:11:25.504 --> 00:11:27.642
Another mystery.

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:30.648
[LUFFY] Hmm. Yeah, that's
some pretty weird stuff,

00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:32.919
but I gotta admit,
it does look cool.

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.889
And super manly!

00:11:37.327 --> 00:11:39.398
Yeah, I like it, too.

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:42.104
[COMPETITOR K] Well, if it isn't
Rebecca, the great warrior!

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:43.940
[COMPETITORS chuckle]

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:46.680
You think you can keep that
win record going out there?

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:50.353
I bet you're happy, huh?
About Spartan.

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.758
Your bully really got
his ass kicked, didn't he?

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:53.794
[COMPETITORS laugh]

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:56.298
All right, knock it off,
ya idiot. Let's go.

00:11:56.331 --> 00:11:57.602
I'll see ya later.

00:11:57.635 --> 00:12:00.440
Everyone's lookin' forward to
watchin' you go down today.

00:12:00.473 --> 00:12:03.245
[COMPETITORS laughing]

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.715
What's up with them?

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:06.318
[REBECCA]
Pay them no mind.

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:20.948
No more.

00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:26.593
[REBECCA inhales, exhales]

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:29.064
Today will be my
final battle here.

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:33.038
I will take the Devil Fruit
prize for my own and end this.

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:37.748
I will kill... Doflamingo!

00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.286
[LUFFY gasps]
Mingo?

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:43.393
[REBECCA]
What block are you in?

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:44.394
[LUFFY]
C.

00:12:44.427 --> 00:12:46.766
[REBECCA]
That's good. I'm in D.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.704
I'll cross my fingers for us.

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:51.576
I hope we both survive
the first round.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.978
Bye, Lucy.

00:13:09.445 --> 00:13:12.083
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:13:19.097 --> 00:13:21.569
It's insane.
This guy is too fierce.

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:24.008
[BURGESS]
Happy Store!

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.011
The titan in the paper mask,

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:30.486
known only as Mister Store,
is a monster!

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.961
Is it even possible for
this man to be defeated?

00:13:33.994 --> 00:13:36.700
[COMPETITOR P] Hey! Block A's
got one helluva beast in it!

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.304
Huh? What beast? Who is he?

00:13:39.337 --> 00:13:43.146
I'm not dyin' in this ring!
I'm walkin' out a winner!

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:45.584
[GYATS] Good luck
getting outta that one!

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.655
[COMPETITORS yell]

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:50.159
[COMPETITOR R yells]

00:13:50.192 --> 00:13:51.896
[BURGESS grunts]

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:56.438
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:02.785
[BURGESS]
Happy Store!

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:18.048
Uh, we have the
champion of Block A!

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:22.825
The masked man takes
it all! Mr. Store!

00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:25.664
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.906
[GYATS] He ended the fight
in a mere moment!

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:35.449
I do believe that the Colosseum
has found a new hero!

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:41.361
[GYATS gasps]
Hang on!

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:44.502
It looks as though the mystery
man is about to remove his mask!

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:45.938
Is this happening?

00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:47.741
The mask is off!

00:14:47.774 --> 00:14:48.877
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:49.745
[GYATS]
What?!

00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:50.915
[CROWD gasps]

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:53.018
Hey, isn't that...

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:59.364
I see! It seems our
mystery man is a fighter

00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:02.337
famous across the whole world!

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.544
What a stunning opening
and an unexpected victor!

00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:09.786
The winner of the Block A
battle royale is...

00:15:09.819 --> 00:15:12.558
[gasps] That guy?

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.331
[GYATS]
And the victor of Block A is...

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.334
The first division
captain serving under

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:40.479
the fearsome warlord, Emperor
Blackbeard. Jesus Burgess!

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:43.620
[cackles]

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:47.360
[CROWD screams]

00:15:47.393 --> 00:15:52.638
It's him! That champion
guy I saw way back!

00:15:52.672 --> 00:15:55.644
[BURGESS] I'm the greatest
fighting champion in the world!

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:58.415
[BURGESS cackles]

00:15:58.449 --> 00:15:59.986
He's with the
Blackbeard Pirates!

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.625
What the hell are those guys
doin' competitin' in this fight?

00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:05.463
[GYATS] I am still reeling
from the surprise, folks!

00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:08.135
But now we know why
the mysterious masked man

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:10.039
was such a formidable opponent!

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:14.347
I know who I'm rootin' for!
Show 'em how it's done, Burgess!

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.688
[CROWD]
Burgess! Burgess! Burgess!

00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:20.059
Burgess! Burgess!

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:23.098
[FRANKY] So the Blackbeard
Pirates are in the mix.

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.336
I just expected Luffy
to win this tournament

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.641
pretty easily, but now...

00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:29.812
Well, that might
not be the case.

00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.584
Here's hopin' he doesn't
reveal himself somehow.

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.956
Well. I've got a job. So.

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.826
[TOY SOLDIER]
Hey! Not so fast!

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.396
Allow me to join you, sir!

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:39.999
[FRANKY]
What? Get offa me.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.368
[TOY SOLDIER]
We should speak first!

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:44.809
Look, buddy, I don't have time
to waste yakkin', all right?

00:16:44.842 --> 00:16:46.746
[TOY SOLDIER]
Please wait!

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:49.317
Quit it, you damn fool!
Enough already!

00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:51.122
If you don't know where
I can find the factory,

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:52.892
then you're worthless to me!

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:54.862
I've gotta find
a high-ranking big shot

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:56.298
in the Don Quixote Family,

00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.804
and beat the location
outta him! So you--

00:16:58.837 --> 00:17:00.740
--[TOY SOLDIER] Be quiet!
--Why should I?

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:05.382
[TOY SOLDIER] They're looking.
They're watching.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:10.059
We need to leave!

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:13.198
You can't voice such radical
views in a place like this!

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:16.740
All right, come clean.
Who the hell are you?

00:17:16.773 --> 00:17:18.309
[GYATS]
Medics! The injured of Block A

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:21.081
are badly in need
of your service!

00:17:21.114 --> 00:17:23.018
So, Hajrudin the
Pirate Mercenary.

00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:24.622
And Cavendish!

00:17:24.656 --> 00:17:27.160
And Gambia the Missionary?

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:28.129
[WOMAN B]
Let's get outta here.

00:17:28.162 --> 00:17:29.231
[MAN F]
If you say so.

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:31.034
I don't get what the
big rush is about though.

00:17:31.067 --> 00:17:33.873
Yeah. It's a pretty
bad batch, all right.

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:35.845
[MARINE A] It'll be big
trouble if one of these guys

00:17:35.878 --> 00:17:37.982
wins the Flame Flame Fruit.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.420
[MAYNARD] Burgess shocked
the hell outta me, too.

00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:43.425
[MARINE A] Same here.
I'll talk to Issho right away.

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:44.260
[MAYNARD]
You do that.

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:45.831
[GAMBIA]
What's all this about?

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:48.903
Wha'cha doin', buddy?
Talkin to yourself?

00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:53.614
[GAMBIA]
Now hang on.

00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:54.948
You ain't communicatin' with

00:17:54.982 --> 00:17:57.821
someone on the
outside, are ya pal?

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:01.162
'Cuz that would be fishy!

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:03.667
[laughs]

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.303
[GAMBIA]
I'm right, aren't I?

00:18:05.336 --> 00:18:07.575
And hey, what's that
you're writin' down there?

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.044
I heard ya whisperin'
out the names

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:10.848
of the hottest pirates around.

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.019
Gambia? The Missionary?

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:15.524
Right here! That's me!

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:17.995
So what exactly are you up to?

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:20.066
[laughs] Can't say?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.403
[laughs]

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.476
Lemme take a guess here.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:28.816
You're not with the Nav--[gasps]

00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:31.923
Uh, sir? Are you still there?

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.227
Is everything all right?

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.930
Everything's fine.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:38.002
Gimme ten and
I'll call you back.

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:39.972
Yes, sir, roger that.

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:41.408
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cu-lick.

00:18:44.849 --> 00:18:46.987
[MAYNARD]
Keep that nose outta my business

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.389
or you're gonna lose it.

00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:49.725
[GAMBIA]
Whatever you say!

00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:54.100
[MAYNARD] All right, Gambia
The Missionary. Walk away.

00:18:58.342 --> 00:18:59.511
[MAYNARD]
Bastard!

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:00.513
[screams]

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:02.918
[COMPETITOR Z]
Help me!

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:05.591
Don't let that monster
kill me, please!

00:19:05.624 --> 00:19:08.530
[MEDIC A] Pull it together.
The fight's over! You're okay!

00:19:08.563 --> 00:19:10.433
[GYATS] The Colosseum
is still thundering

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:13.707
from the excitement
of Block A! And Block B.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.777
You've got one helluva
show to live up to,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.683
so I hope you bring the pain!

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:23.927
[FUJITORA] Time to make an exit.
I've heard enough.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.066
Plenty of familiar names
to sound the alarm.

00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:36.285
[MARINE A] What's our next
plan of action, sir?

00:19:36.318 --> 00:19:38.289
Oh. Here's your coat.

00:19:38.322 --> 00:19:39.591
[LITTLE GIRL A gasps]

00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:55.623
[gasps]

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:59.532
[FUJITORA] Here you go.
No reason to cry, now.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.504
[LITTLE GIRL A] Uh-huh!
Thank you so much, mister!

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:04.241
[FUJITORA] Of course,
I'm glad I could help.

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:06.344
[LITTLE GIRL A giggles]

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.654
Uh, Issho, sir.
I have your coat here.

00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:13.325
Ah. Thank you.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.370
Shall we continue?

00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:32.163
[FUJITORA]
As a measure of safety,

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:35.871
we should send for no less
than three Navy ships.

00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:40.680
In the meanwhile,
you and I, we'll head for...

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:42.483
What was it called again?

00:20:42.517 --> 00:20:43.753
[MARINE A]
Do you mean Green Bit?

00:20:43.786 --> 00:20:46.158
[FUJITORA] That's it.
We'll make our way there.

00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:48.529
And let's see. We'll need...

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:52.070
Well, call for as many medics
as you possibly can.

00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:54.875
There is the chance
of civilian injuries.

00:20:54.908 --> 00:20:56.979
Right. Yes, sir.

00:20:57.012 --> 00:20:58.482
[FUJITORA]
On the side of intel,

00:20:58.516 --> 00:21:01.522
I want a head count of
all the people in the stands,

00:21:01.555 --> 00:21:03.893
and the exact
population of this town.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:07.167
Wait. You want this
instead of the enemy numbers?

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.839
Is it that necessary?

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:12.511
[FUJITORA]
The enemy you said?

00:21:12.544 --> 00:21:16.853
No, that's not the
number to worry about.

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:18.155
We should only be concerned with

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:21.228
the number of lives
we need to protect first.

00:21:21.261 --> 00:21:22.731
[gasps]

00:21:26.071 --> 00:21:27.507
Yes, sir!

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:30.246
Calling all Marines
in Dressrosa!

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.884
We're relocating our
forces to Green Bit!

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:35.691
Rendezvous in front
of the Colosseum!

00:21:35.724 --> 00:21:38.563
Under command of the Admiral,
we're moving forward!

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:40.633
The plan is in action!

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:47.815
[MAYNARD]
This is Maynard calling back.

00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.185
Sorry for disconnecting earlier.

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:53.059
There's nothing
to worry about here.

00:21:53.092 --> 00:21:54.762
Oh, a name I mentioned,

00:21:54.795 --> 00:21:59.037
Gambia the Missionary,
the one working for Bartolomeo.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.274
Go ahead and cross his name off.

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:04.781
I had the wrong guy.

00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:09.457
Dammit. Navy bastard.

00:22:10.392 --> 00:22:12.029
The plan is still on track.

00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:14.467
So I'm gonna
keep moving forward.

00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:32.437
The infirmary's down the hall!

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.209
We're low on stretchers,
so walk if ya can!

00:22:35.242 --> 00:22:39.116
These dudes are a mess.
The champ really got 'em.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.132
[BELLAMY chuckles]

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:50.072
[BELLAMY]
Hey.

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:51.274
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:55.116
Nice get up, but do ya
think I'm blind?

00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:57.186
I don't care how good
the disguise is,

00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:58.723
when it comes to
the guy who managed to

00:22:58.756 --> 00:23:01.629
swerve my career
into the skids...

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:05.904
...I'm gonna know his face.

00:23:05.937 --> 00:23:09.110
[LUFFY gasps]
It's you?

00:23:14.822 --> 00:23:16.391
[NARRATOR]
As the competitors are revealed,

00:23:16.424 --> 00:23:18.797
Luffy comes face-to-face
with yet another opponent

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.934
who hopes to win
the Flame Flame Fruit.

00:23:20.968 --> 00:23:24.541
And his ambitions are every bit
as wild and selfish as the rest.

00:23:24.574 --> 00:23:27.212
Surprisingly, this
all-too-familiar foe is someone

00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:30.118
Luffy already battled during
his time in Mock Town!

00:23:30.152 --> 00:23:31.789
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.822 --> 00:23:34.895
"The Fateful Reunion!
Bellamy the Hyena!"

00:23:34.928 --> 00:23:37.801
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
