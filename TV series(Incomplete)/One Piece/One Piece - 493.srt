1
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,822
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,559
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,127
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,130
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,664
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,501
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,336
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,072
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,942
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,577
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,111
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,615
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,018
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,121
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,558
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:16,496
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,171
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,840
Luffy launched a desperate
attack on Navy Headquarters,

19
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,743
in hopes of saving his
brother from execution.

20
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,180
However, his struggle ended in
vain, with his enemies claiming

21
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:37,784
an overwhelming victory,
along with Ace's life.

22
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,458
My brother Ace is
really dead, isn't he?

23
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,862
[JIMBEI]
Yes, I'm afraid that he is.

24
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:52,265
[LUFFY sobs]

25
00:03:52,299 --> 00:04:02,275
[screams]

26
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,347
[LUFFY]
Ace!

27
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,286
[LUFFY]
"Luffy and Ace!

28
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,154
The Story of How
the Brothers Met!"

29
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,696
[NARRATOR] No one could
have guessed it at the time,

30
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,434
but the path that led Luffy
to Marineford began long ago.

31
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,337
Ten years ago, in fact,
in the East Blue.

32
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,576
There lies a small town,
known as Windmill Village,

33
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,712
where people lived
quiet, peaceful lives.

34
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,814
But it was the
nearby Mount Corvo,

35
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,517
where few would
dare to set foot.

36
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,221
For only the strong could
survive in its dark woods,

37
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,757
faced with beasts that would
make quick work of trespassers.

38
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:55,729
[LUFFY] What's wrong with being
king of the pirates, Grandpa?

39
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,332
Pirates are cool!

40
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,267
And what makes you think I care?

41
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,469
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna slap you!

42
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,172
[GARP] Eating that Devil Fruit
wasn't enough trouble for you?

43
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,473
Now this nonsense?

44
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,509
You, and your big brother Ace,

45
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,578
are both going to become fine
Marines, you understand me?

46
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,280
Ow, ow, ow you suck!

47
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,548
I thought I was supposed to
be made outta rubber now--

48
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,285
why does this
still hurt so much?

49
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,153
[GARP] I thought leaving
you in a nice village

50
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,689
would keep you safe,
but pirates won't be satisfied

51
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,692
until they get their grubby
hands on everything!

52
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,628
And I forbid you to associate
with that "Red-Haired" Shanks.

53
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,163
He's a terrible influence!

54
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,433
[LUFFY]
Nuh-uh, he's awesome.

55
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,701
And I'm gonna be just like him!

56
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,469
Oh yeah?!

57
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,845
What's this dump?

58
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,449
Hey, shut the hell up!

59
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,752
Whatever it is you're sellin',
I don't want none!

60
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,687
[GARP]
Dadan.

61
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,288
Huh?!

62
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,790
[shrieks]

63
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,592
Garp! What are you doin' here?!

64
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,806
[GARP]
Charming as ever.

65
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,275
Sorry for the cold welcome,
but I hope

66
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,178
you don't have another
ridiculous favor to ask us!

67
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,647
You realize Ace
is already ten, right?

68
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,715
[GARP]
Oh, is he now?

69
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,384
And how's the
little scamp doing?

70
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,151
Good?

71
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,220
Well, he's a handful, of course!

72
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,522
And we've been watching
over the brat for long enough!

73
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,124
So just take him away!

74
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,024
[GARP]
Never mind.

75
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,126
Yeah, that's the
problem--we do mind!

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,429
And speaking of brats,
would you shut that one up?

77
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,231
He's yours now.

78
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,866
[DADAN]
Huh?

79
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,834
Hey, Luffy, tell 'em hello.

80
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:41,635
Yo!

81
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,371
Wait a sec, who is he?

82
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:47,207
He's my... grandson.

83
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,177
[DADAN, MAGRA, DOGRA]
Huh?! What?!

84
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,444
[DOGRA]
I never heard about this!

85
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,115
[DADAN] And you want us to
take care of the little monster,

86
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:55,816
uh, little darling, I mean.

87
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,318
Well, no way!

88
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,085
Fine.

89
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,419
Then I'll give you two choices:

90
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,290
You can either raise my grandson
or spend your life in prison.

91
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,893
Pretty generous, considering
all the crimes you've committed.

92
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,429
[laughs]

93
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,297
No fair!

94
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,164
The thing is,

95
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,167
I'd rather stay
outta the slammer.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,102
Frankly, if you asked me
that on one of Ace's bad days,

97
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,639
I might have to go for
the prison option after all.

98
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,674
And two brats?

99
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,275
Yeah, I don't think so.

100
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,111
This kid looks like
a real charmer, too.

101
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,345
[LUFFY]
Like your face?

102
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,115
You wanna fight,
you little punk?

103
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:28,782
So rude!

104
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,650
[DOGRA, MAGRA]
Dadan!

105
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,285
[DOGRA]
Don't let him get to you!

106
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:32,152
What the heck?

107
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:32,820
Ew!

108
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:33,820
Spit!

109
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,188
That's gross!

110
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,123
Who did that?

111
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,191
Hey!

112
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,227
You jerk!

113
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,129
You better apologize for that!

114
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:42,596
Hey!

115
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,797
There he is!

116
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,399
Oh, hello, Ace, welcome back!

117
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,740
I'm waiting!

118
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,778
[GARP]
Luffy, This here is Ace.

119
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,580
He's three years older than you.

120
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,850
Anyway, you're gonna be living
with him and Dadan from now on.

121
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,552
What? Not so fast!

122
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,259
You play nice.

123
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,827
We said, "No"!

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,629
You'll do it.

125
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,532
Sir, as you wish, sir!

126
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,335
[GARP]
Well, time to hit the road.

127
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,637
I'll stop by again
when I have time.

128
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,372
[DOGRA]
What about some child support?

129
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,307
[GARP]
Put it on my tab.

130
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,442
[DADAN]
This isn't a bar.

131
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,242
[GARP]
Huh?

132
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,010
[DADAN]
Nothing! Come back soon!

133
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:31,245
[MAGRA]
Boss, we're bandits!

134
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,280
We can't take in another kid!

135
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:34,247
[DADAN]
Shut up and fix dinner.

136
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,282
We'll figure it out.

137
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,850
[MAGRA]
Yes, ma'am!

138
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,418
Say you're sorry!

139
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,220
Hey, come back!

140
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,757
[SHANKS]
I'll leave this hat to you.

141
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,505
[LUFFY]
Where did he go?

142
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,208
[BANDIT A]
Hold it!

143
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,209
Let me go!

144
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,177
Give me all of your money,
or I kill you!

145
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,445
I don't got any!

146
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,147
I'm a kid!

147
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,281
Fine!

148
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,149
Then go tell your parents
to bring us their money!

149
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,217
I have a grandpa.

150
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,218
Okay, good enough.

151
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,186
Tell us his name,
and we'll go find him.

152
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,255
It's Garp.

153
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,489
[ALL 3 gasp]

154
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,656
Not "the Garp"!

155
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,293
And the kid's gonna be
staying with us from now on.

156
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,629
[BANDIT AA]
Why did you agree to this?

157
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,630
[BANDIT BB] We're
not running a daycare here!

158
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,133
[BANDIT CC]
C'mon, Boss, grow a spine!

159
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,268
That's enough!

160
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,802
It's dinner time, boys!

161
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,770
You can argue when you're done!

162
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,774
[BANDIT DD]
I want the big one!

163
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:34,441
[BANDIT EE]
Screw you!

164
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,609
I saw it first!

165
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,310
Save some for me!

166
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,814
You already ate your share, pal!

167
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:41,848
[BANDIT F]
Gimme!

168
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,151
I'm not losing
to you youngsters!

169
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,085
You share or you die!

170
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,254
It's survival of
the fittest, my friends.

171
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:54,194
[BANDIT FF]
You broke his arm!

172
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,662
[LUFFY]
C'mon.

173
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,266
[BANDIT GG]
It's your turn to do the dishes.

174
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,468
[LUFFY]
Old man.

175
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:01,335
Can I have some more?

176
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,271
I'm a woman,
thank you very much!

177
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,572
Do you even know
where you are right now,

178
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,173
you filthy little urchin?

179
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:07,874
[LUFFY]
Nope.

180
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,176
Okay, then I'll tell you.

181
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,111
This is the den of
the Dadan Family--

182
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,280
mountain bandits
that rule Mount Corvo!

183
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,648
Mountain bandits?

184
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,348
Bluh.

185
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,851
Mountain bandits are lame.

186
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,287
Well, you're stuck with us!

187
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,321
Or rather, we're stuck with you,

188
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,723
thanks to that pushy
grandfather of yours!

189
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,692
But if you don't want to stay,
that's fine by me--

190
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,128
go get eaten by a bunch
of wolves for all I care!

191
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,197
Easy, Boss. Easy.

192
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:32,699
I just wanted s'more rice.

193
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,468
[LUFFY]
Or meat.

194
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,536
Meat would be nice.

195
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,511
In case you didn't notice,

196
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:47,114
all this meat came from
that bison Ace brought back.

197
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:50,450
Even though he's a kid like you,
he has to work to earn his keep.

198
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,519
The bandit life's
a hard one, boy.

199
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:56,123
Tomorrow, you're gonna pay
in blood, sweat, and tears:

200
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,793
Cleaning, doing laundry,
polishing our boots and weapons,

201
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,230
robbery, fraud,
murder, and terror!

202
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,766
And if you go crying
to your dear old grandpa,

203
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,435
we'll string you up
without a second thought!

204
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,437
One bowl of rice
and one glass of water,

205
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,840
that's all I can promise you.

206
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,208
The rest you get for yourself.

207
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,411
You're gonna have
to grow up real fast, kid.

208
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,413
Or you'll go hungry
before the week's up.

209
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,480
No problem.

210
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,617
"No problem"? Not crying
and begging for mercy?

211
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,386
Grandpa threw me
in the jungle one time,

212
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,487
so I know how to
tough it out just fine.

213
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,290
There's plenty of water to drink
and I can eat frogs and snakes

214
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,793
and mushrooms
and stuff all I want.

215
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,363
I'm gonna be a pirate someday,
so I gotta be strong!

216
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:39,166
This is gonna be real fun!

217
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:39,866
[BANDIT HH]
Boss!

218
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,734
[BANDIT II]
You okay?

219
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,269
[BANDIT JJ]
Hurry! Help her up!

220
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,838
[BANDITS]
Heave-ho!

221
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:46,307
Huh.

222
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,307
Why is he leaving?

223
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,142
[BANDITS]
One more!

224
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,645
Hey, get back here, you!

225
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,281
Hold on, what d'you mean
you're gonna be a pirate?

226
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,283
And stop ignoring me!

227
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,551
[LUFFY]
Hey!

228
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,290
He just got here,
and he's already a pain!

229
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,193
It's gonna be like having
a baby Garp living with us!

230
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,162
Now, now, it's okay!

231
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,798
[LUFFY]
Hey!

232
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,866
Wait for me!

233
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,735
Hey!

234
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:18,739
Hi!

235
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,174
My name's Luffy!

236
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,475
Everything's cool now!

237
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,144
I'm not mad about
you spitting on me!

238
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,115
[laughs]

239
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,884
Why are you all laughing?

240
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,286
But the guy just spilled
some booze on me.

241
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,555
It's not worth getting
bent out of shape.

242
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,524
It's not worth getting
bent out of shape!

243
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,726
I'd rather be friends!

244
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,727
So, can I come with you?

245
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,136
[screams]

246
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,141
[LUFFY]
It's a dead end!

247
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:24,404
[pants]

248
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,429
[LUFFY screams]

249
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,186
[BANDIT KK]
Ace is back!

250
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,055
You know what that means!

251
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,090
[BANDITS]
Food!

252
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,093
[DOGRA]
Huh? Wait. You're alone?

253
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,361
That's not good.

254
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,329
Uh, yeah.

255
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,031
Where's Luffy?

256
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,232
Wasn't he with you?

257
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,566
Beats me.

258
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,739
Come on, you snot-nosed brat.

259
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,640
Where did you go?

260
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,376
You think maybe
he died out there?

261
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,045
If he did, it's gonna
be our funeral, too.

262
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,349
The boss must be
worried sick right about now.

263
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,751
Get a hold of yourself!

264
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,186
This is serious!

265
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,221
No biggie.

266
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,089
Oh, and is that what
you're gonna say to Garp

267
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,124
when he finds out we
let his grandson die?

268
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:51,992
Why do you care?

269
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,160
One less crappy
brat in the world.

270
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,597
I have a feeling that
Garp won't see it that way.

271
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:00,200
Well, maybe the old jackass
should've thought about that

272
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,836
before he left him with a
bunch of bandits in the woods!

273
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,539
Come on, does this look
like a damn daycare to you?

274
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,375
If he can't take care
of the boy himself,

275
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,076
he has no right to talk!

276
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,678
You should tell
him that, not us.

277
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,012
Suck it!

278
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,561
[FLASHBACK PIRATE]
If Gold Roger had a son?

279
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,329
What are you talking about?

280
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,400
He'd end up just like his dad.

281
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,168
Off with his damn head.

282
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:38,138
Then he'd cry and
shut 'em down for good!

283
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,074
"I'm trash, just like my dad!"

284
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,576
"I should die!"

285
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,448
[laughter]

286
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:51,885
[DADAN]
Y'know what?

287
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:55,389
While we're at it,
screw Ace, too!

288
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,560
[DADAN] If he dies, we'll
tell Garp it was an accident.

289
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,362
I mean, that'd be
the truth, wouldn't it?

290
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,398
The devil's children
have the devil's luck!

291
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,499
How 'bout that?

292
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,703
'Cause Ace is
the devil's son, for sure.

293
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,037
What do you think
the Government would do

294
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,139
if they found out about him?

295
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:12,906
Hah!

296
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,375
I'll take my chances with Garp!

297
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,044
[MAGRA]
Hey, you don't mean that, Boss.

298
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,213
[DOGRA] Come on,
that's the booze talking.

299
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,114
Just sleep it off.

300
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,185
[NARRATOR] One week later.

301
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:32,159

302
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:35,496
Damn dog.

303
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,665
Don't you know
we're trying to sleep?!

304
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:39,600
[shrieks]

305
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,102
Boss! Wake up! C'mere, quick!

306
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:44,604
[DADAN]
What?

307
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:46,106
Oh!

308
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,208
It's you!

309
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,009
[DOGRA] The little
bugger isn't dead after all!

[barking]

311
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,050
You're alive.

312
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,052
Why'd you scare us like that?

313
00:16:59,086 --> 00:16:59,620
Huh?

314
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,254
Easy, easy, Boss.

315
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,223
Where the hell were you,
and what were you doing?

316
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:05,092
Now, now, just
give him a second--

317
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,127
he'll answer without all
the face stretching.

318
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,764
I was stuck at the bottom of the
valley getting chased by wolves.

319
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:11,832
Are you nuts?

320
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:15,101
What the heck were you
trying to do down there?

321
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,071
[DOGRA]
Well, whatever.

322
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,073
It's good you came back safe.

323
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,075
There's nothing good about it!

324
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,611
Another useless mouth to feed!

325
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:26,814
Get some sleep while you can.

326
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:30,016
We're putting you to work
bright and early tomorrow!

327
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:41,662
Hey, Ace!

328
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,597
You going somewhere fun today?

329
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,931
Take me!

330
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:49,203
I know I was gone for a while,
but I still wanna be friends!

331
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,371
Wait!

332
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,106
[DOGRA] Boss! He's
running after Ace again!

333
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,108
Hey!

334
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,778
Get back here--you
still have chores to do!

335
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,614
Nyah! I'm outta here!

336
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,185
I am gonna wring your
rotten neck, you twerp!

337
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,319
Easy, easy!

338
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,388
You shut your yapper
and go bring him back!

339
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,355
[MAGRA]
Yes, ma'am.

Come on!

343
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,024
I wanna be friends with you!

Hey, Ace!

347
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,470
Let's be friends!

348
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,508
Do your damn chores, kid!

349
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,509
[DOGRA]
He's already gone.

350
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,844
Well, hurry up and
bring him back, then!

351
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:06,279
You're not getting
away from me today!

352
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:09,282
That's easy!

353
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,354
So, are we friends yet?

354
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,056
[screams]

355
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,428
[NARRATOR]
And on the tenth day.

356
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:21,495
Luffy!

357
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,430
You're too late again,
he's already long gone.

358
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:25,031
Then bring him back!

359
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,005
[NARRATOR] It was the
same thing every time.

360
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,242
[LUFFY screams]

361
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:37,511
[NARRATOR] But that didn't
deter him one bit.

362
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,045
[LUFFY]
Ace!

363
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,523
[NARRATOR]
A month passed.

364
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,025
Two months.

365
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,427
[LUFFY]
Wait up!

366
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:55,529
[NARRATOR]
In the rain.

367
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,164
Or in the wind.

368
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:57,631
[LUFFY shrieks]

369
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,500
[gasps]

370
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,435
[LUFFY]
Let's be friends!

371
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,571
[NARRATOR] Ace would run
and Luffy would chase him.

372
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:09,276
[DADAN]
Again?

373
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,443
What does that moron
think he's gonna accomplish?

374
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,779
[DOGRA] He's getting
banged up pretty bad out there.

375
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:15,049
He's bound to lose
interest sooner or later.

376
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:15,983
Let's hope!

377
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:18,085
This nonsense is
really stressing me out!

378
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,420
You're worried
about him, aren't you?

379
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:20,554
[DADAN]
Don't be stupid!

380
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,689
I'm just mad 'cause
he's not pulling his weight!

381
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,092
[screams]

382
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:27,527
A beehive fell on my head.

383
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,397
Luffy?

384
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,535
[LUFFY]
Come back!

385
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,580
[LUFFY]
I'm not giving up yet!

386
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,583
I'm having a tough
time losing him today.

387
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,284
Stubborn punk.

388
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,388
Uh-oh!

389
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,022
Crap!

390
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,023
[LUFFY]
This sucks!

391
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,090
Got away again!

392
00:20:57,124 --> 00:20:59,359
How'd he get so darn fast?

393
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:02,662
Hey, there you are!

394
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,699
[screams]

395
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:13,140
[ACE] That's gotta be the
nastiest monster in the forest.

396
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:15,342
Even I can't beat that thing!

397
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,179
[ACE]
Run away, stupid!

398
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,981
It's gonna eat you!

399
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,052
I wanna run away,
but my legs won't let me!

400
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,319
Damn it.

401
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,415
[pants]

402
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:18,104
[chuckles]

403
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,688
[NARRATOR] Three months
had passed, and although

404
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:40,060
he was covered with cuts and
bruises, Luffy did not relent.

405
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,467
[LUFFY]
It's the end of the forest.

406
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,185
[LUFFY]
What is this place?

407
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,595
[NARRATOR]
Mountains of discarded trash

408
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:19,133
reach toward the sky in the
criminal-infested junkyard

409
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,068
known as Gray Terminal.

410
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,370
With dreams of buying
a pirate ship in their hearts,

411
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:25,572
Ace and his partner
in crime, Sabo,

412
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:30,010
rob the thieves and scavengers
in this den of lawlessness.

413
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,745
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

414
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,182
"Here Comes Sabo!
The Boy at the Gray Terminal!"

415
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,284
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
