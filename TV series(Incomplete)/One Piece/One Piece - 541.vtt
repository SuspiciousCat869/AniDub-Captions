WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:38.625
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.528
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.766
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.935
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.303
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.572
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.474
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.876
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.579
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.250
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.818
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.522
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:13.660
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.932
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.701
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:25.572
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.974
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:32.679
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.982
[NARRATOR] It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.351
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:41.554
After traveling to the Sea
Forest and meeting with Jimbei,

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.856
Luffy and his crew learn
of the tumultuous history

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.459
of Fishman Island
that, even today,

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.728
continues to shape the kingdom.

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.774
[LUFFY] "Kizaru Appears!
A Trap to Catch Tiger!"

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.679
[JIMBEI]
And that's what started it all.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:10.250
Fisher Tiger's attack on
the Holy Land of Marie Jois,

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.719
and the formation
of the Sun Pirates.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:19.292
These momentous events--they
shaped the future of my people.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:39.112
[NEPTUNE] It's hard to believe
he really went through with it.

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:43.249
[NEPTUNE sighs]
His actions have only

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.819
created more problems
for Fishman Island.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:48.688
It will be quite
some time before

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.057
we're welcomed back
to the World Summit.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.761
I don't even know where
to begin to fix this.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.396
[OTOHIME]
But we share the blame.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.599
Remember, we just couldn't
bring ourselves to stop him.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.936
[NEPTUNE] Tell me, why are
you so adamant about this?

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.139
What did you see on your trip?

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:08.541
I saw human nature!

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.611
[OTOHIME] Because I understood
the depth of his suffering...

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.714
...the scream of his soul--
it was unbearable.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.582
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm.

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.531
[FISHMAN M]
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.599
Wow! He's such a badass!

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.302
Fighting the Celestial
Dragons? Talk about balls!

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.872
Yeah, that makes it official!
Fisher Tiger is a true hero!

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:43.242
Whoa. A Fishman's gonna
wind up in the history books!

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:45.445
Listen! Gather around!

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.680
Hey, it's Queen Otohime.

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:48.815
What is it now?

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.352
We have cowered, and hid,
and run--and yet for what?

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.253
What have we gained from this?

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:56.522
What good has this path
done for our people?

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:59.225
We can't simply turn our
backs on the entire world,

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.794
to cut off all humans--
it will doom us.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:04.997
Some humans are bad, yes,
but not all of them!

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.399
Now...

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.335
...we must learn to live
in harmony with humanity!

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.537
And together we
can grow with them

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.873
under the bright,
nourishing sun!

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.408
Grow with them, huh?

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.344
Yeah. That's just
too much to ask.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.747
Hey! You two!

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.981
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:22.882
[FISHMAN F, FISHMAN E gasp]

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:23.883
Sign here!

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.419
B-But I can't. I'm sorry.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.121
Please. The whole island--

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:30.523
Tiger's a hero to us
for what he did, y'know?

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:31.724
It's just...

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.026
...we know his actions might
turn the humans against us,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.029
but it's their fault.
They brought it on themselves.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.831
So, we can't sign.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:43.202
I know how you feel, but in
7 years or even 15 years?

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.304
You have to think
about that future!

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.507
There will come a day when we
will be able to participate

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.042
in the World Summit again!

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.746
You have to sign! For our
future! I'm begging you!

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.249
[HORDY] I'm telling you,
Fisher Tiger gets it!

00:06:56.282 --> 00:06:59.051
This is how you represent
the Fishman District!

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.888
He went head to head
with the Celestial Dragons!

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.623
And he freakin' won!

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:04.791
[ALL gasp]

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.393
[ZEO] Way to stick it
to those disgusting humans!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.462
It's just like
Arlong used to say,

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.798
the only good human
is a dead one!

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:13.099
[DARUMA laughs]

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.134
Yeah! Now put 'em
in their place!

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.903
The Sun Pirates are so cool!

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:20.373
I mean, sailing the sea
and slammin' the dosun down

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:23.176
on every dumb human
they meet! It's awesome!

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.444
You know what?

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.647
If we were a little stronger,
then I bet we could join 'em!

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.083
We'll get strong! Then we will!

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:35.755
Take back the sea, Sun Pirates!
Kill all those worthless humans!

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:37.256
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.925

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.129
[ALL laughing]

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.935
[HACHI] Hey, boss!
Boss, there's an enemy ship!

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.403
Boss! Hey!

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:51.871
Hey! Guys!

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.206
Did ya hear me?

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:55.675
We've got a crisis!

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.778
Shut up, Hachi. Crap.

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.881
Calm down. Just tell
us what's going on.

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.283
[TIGER] Well, this is
troubling. Is it the Navy?

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.487
Must be. They were flying
their flag out there.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.422
All right. What's next?

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.660
War.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:17.463
[KADAR] There's no mistake!
Those are the Sun Pirates.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.532
Kill Fisher Tiger!

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:25.004
[laughs]

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:27.473
Real nice aim there!

[SUN PIRATES shouting]

00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.312
Fire!

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.918
[KADAR] What're you
doing? Shoot them dead!

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.521
[MARINE B] We're trying,
but they're swimming too fast!

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.424

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.080
You Fishman bastards!

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:11.350
Return the slaves!
Dammit! Surrender!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.753
If you play ball,
they'll drop the charges!

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:14.987

the bottom of the ship!

You fools!

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:31.370
Give us back the slaves
and this will end!

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.173
Do you even realize the serious
crime you've committed?

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.841
How dare you turn on humans!

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.878
Know your place,
you disgusting Fishmen!

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:42.782
What was that? Go on now.

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.383

Please, somebody help me.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:55.962
So, slavery's perfectly legal,
but freeing slaves is a crime?

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:59.131
And Queen Otohime thinks
you deserve a chance.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.467
Not that you'd give us one.

Blow him to pieces, men!

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:26.826
We know that you're
hiding the slaves!

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:30.463
And now, you're gonna die
for the havoc you've wrought!

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.634
Whoa, what the hell?

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.702

What proof do you possibly have
that we're hiding them on board?

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:55.287
Go on and check all
of us if you want to,

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.889
but from what I understand,

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:59.058
these slaves should
have a brand on them.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.160
Do you see that
mark on any of us?

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:03.562

Being human is a sin.

deserving execution.

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:51.143
[KIZARU]
Oh? Why did he engage them?

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:54.613
I only wanted a report on
their current whereabouts.

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.949
If you get close enough
to see them, well,

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:58.184
that's apparently all it takes

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.886
before their entire crew
surrounds you in the water.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.424
Oh, scary. Fishmen... Guess
we should've expected that.

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:10.129
Okay. Do you have any
intel you can share?

00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:14.100
Well, way it looks, Arlong and
his men are part of the crew.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.769
And they were responsible
for the raids in the area

00:12:16.802 --> 00:12:19.338
surrounding Fishman Island.

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.240
But we have yet
to fight them on land,

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.376
so it's hard to tell
how strong they are.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.947
Arlong... Right,
I've heard of him.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:31.417
There's another dangerous
one on their crew.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.553
He's as big as Fisher Tiger
and just as brutal.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.155
Didn't catch his name.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:39.825
[KIZARU]
Well, sounds like a real mess.

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.694
--[thud]
--[ARLONG] Ow, that hurt!

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.330
[SUN PIRATES laughing]

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:45.698
What's the big deal?

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:46.966
Why the hell do you care

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:50.102
if we kill one or two
of those inferior creatures?

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.874
It's not about them.
You're both going too far.

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:57.943
Look, we're not a group of
killers, we're better than that,

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.378
and don't you forget it.

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.581
But, look, Brother.
Sorry, I mean, Boss.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.817
These humans have
no such compunction.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.819
They are actively
out to kill you.

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:08.420
So, can you blame us?

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:12.458
Of course, we might go too far
from time to time. We're mad!

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:14.493
Do you want to
be like the humans?

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:17.496
Killing someone is to kill
a part of your own soul!

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.833
We are not seeking revenge
for the discrimination here,

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:23.569
and that's not what Marie
Jois was about, either.

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:26.005
I might have broken that
stupid, unspoken rule,

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.407
but I only did it
to free those slaves.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.708
The Sun Pirates are driven by

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:31.777
the idea of liberation
and freedom,

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:34.413
not spiteful retribution.

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.148
Seeking vengeance
against the humans

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.651
only creates a vicious cycle.

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.386
Violence begets violence,

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:43.856
and I will not be responsible
for more tragedy.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:45.825
We'll end up condemning
the next generation

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:48.260
of Fishmen to war with humanity.

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.597
[TIGER]
Can't you see that?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.400
We will fight and rob
those who come after us.

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:56.802
But we won't cross the line.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:00.005
We will not become killers!

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.078
Listen, Brother!

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.948
I think you're overlooking
one simple fact.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.251
Violence always begets
violence, you say?

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.786
Well, not if they're all dead.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:17.122
Who's gonna fight
back if we kill them?

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.691
We'll massacre the animals

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:21.560
and force all of the women
and children to watch,

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:25.264
terrifying the idea of revenge
right out of their minds.

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.765
All we have to do is show them

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.368
how powerful and
ruthless we can be!

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:32.371
And then they'll be
paralyzed with terror!

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:34.139
They will never--

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:35.608
What the hell is your problem?

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:39.979
[SUN PIRATES laughing]

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:19.652
[TIGER]
That you, Jimbei?

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:23.756
[JIMBEI]
Arlong's a hothead who seems

00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:26.492
to strive to make
a nuisance of himself.

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:36.802
I don't blame him.

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:40.873
Truth is, I've got no right
to cast any judgment on the guy.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:44.576
I didn't mean...

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.378
[TIGER]
Jimbei.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:50.416
It's great, what Queen
Otohime's trying to accomplish.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:53.252
Though, understandably, to her,

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.721
there's no difference
between Arlong and me.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:02.828
[TIGER grunts]

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:10.102
Honestly, there's only one thing
that I'm really afraid of--

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:11.870
my own mind.

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.910
It's taken me all these years

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:20.813
to understand why
he told me that...

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.181
...what he meant.

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.753
[HACHI] Up ahead!
There's a pirate ship!

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.221
[SUN PIRATE AA]
Looks like a big one.

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:30.723
[SUN PIRATE BB]
I'm guessin' they wanna take us

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.458
on to prove themselves.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.626
We're really wrackin'
up the enemies.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.798
Well, I say we sink their ship.
Best to make an example of them.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.068
We were engaged in combat
on a daily basis--

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:45.671
criminals hunted by
the World Government.

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:48.407
Meanwhile, Queen
Otohime waged her own

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.510
stubborn form of battle
against the world.

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:52.644
[OTOHIME]
Sign here!

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.814
[FISHMEN] No! We won't!
We don't wanna live with humans!

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.683
Please sign!

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:58.817
Hey!

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:02.955
The government put out
a bounty on Boss Tai and Jimbei!

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.390
Seriously?

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.992
[SUN PIRATE CC]
Wow, 230 million Berries!

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:10.262
[SUN PIRATE DD] Jimbei's
got 76 million on his head!

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:11.797
[IKAROS]
Wanted posters!

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.600
Look, they raised
the reward on them again!

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:16.769
[ZEO] Even the World
Government is scared of them!

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:20.072
[chuckles] They're gonna
sink the entire Navy!

00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:21.874
[panting, gasps]

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:23.409
I need you to sign it!

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:25.577
Let me go, Your Majesty!

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.914
[JIMBEI] The next three years
unfolded in a similar manner.

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:32.951
And then one day, we came across
a young girl on an island.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.919
[OLD MAN A]
Mister...

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.988
We could use your
help with something.

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.189
[TIGER]
Hmm?

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:38.257
[OLD MAN A]
This girl here,

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.160
she escaped from Marie Jois
with the rest of us

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:44.730
back when you liberated us
from slavery three years ago.

00:17:44.763 --> 00:17:47.132
Here, look.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.735
[TIGER grunts]

00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:52.604
She... hasn't seen her
parents in many years,

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.273
and her home's far away.

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:57.009
We would like to help.
I'm sure they miss her,

00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:00.245
but it's highly doubtful
we can safely cross the ocean.

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.216
[KOALA]
I'm Koala and I'm 11 years old.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.684
Thanks for saving me.

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:09.288
I'll do my best not to
cause you any more trouble.

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:12.658
[ARLONG] I know she's a kid, but
she's still a disgusting human!

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.827
Why the hell would you
let her on board with us?

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.962
[TIGER]
Just drop it, Arlong.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:20.132
I'll drop this ugly brat!
Quit smiling, dammit!

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:21.166
Arlong, no!

Let go, Hachi! I'm not done yet!

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:32.211
He's right. It is creepy
how she won't stop smiling.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.281
[KOALA gasps]

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.118
[HACHI]
Huh?

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:44.289
[ARLONG]
What are you...?

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:46.792
[KOALA]
I'm sorry! I'm a hard worker!

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.328
I'll clean and I don't
need to take a break!

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.029
So please don't hit me!

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:54.199
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.335
I'll give it my best.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:57.569
Stop.

00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:00.405
[KOALA]
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.740
I'll clean it.

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.642
You're... bleeding.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.177
[KOALA]
I'm sorry!

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.513
I promise that I'll never cry.

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.248
Just please don't kill me.

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.349
[JIMBEI]
Huh?

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:16.121
It's all right.
Are you scared of us?

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:18.724
[KOALA] Yes, but
I really miss my mother.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.826
So, I made myself get on board.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:23.529
[KOALA]
I won't stop cleaning.

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:27.065
I know if I do, you'll
think I'm useless and kill me.

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.569
But I'm a hard worker,
so please let me live.

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:35.741
Well, what d'ya expect?
The kid was raised a slave.

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:37.242
Think about what she's seen.

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:39.444
I'm sure plenty of
her friends got killed,

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:41.180
and probably just for crying,

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.182
or getting caught
taking a break.

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:46.585
She's spent her whole life bein'
afraid that she might be next.

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.754
Can ya blame her for
not trusting anyone?

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.600
[KOALA] Please don't
kill me. I'll do anything.

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.835
I promise I'll be good!

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:07.105
Pick up this brat.
I want her brought to my room.

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:10.676
What's he doin' in there?

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:12.644
[SUN PIRATE FF]
Lecturing her won't do any good.

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:14.613

It may have hurt,
but she'd never get past

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:40.906
the pain of being a slave
with that mark on her.

Hey, kid! You still alive?

Oh, good, you're awake.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:53.151
[KOALA] Oh. I guess
I passed out. I'm sorry!

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:56.588
But, but I didn't cry, did I?
So you don't need to kill me.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.690
I promise you, I'll never cry!

00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:00.525
So please, let me live!

We are nothing like those
evil Celestial Dragons.

So, don't you dare
act like we are.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.842
Now watch.

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:09.321
[KOALA wailing]

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:14.626
[NARRATOR]
After a long voyage,

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:17.763
Tiger finally brings
Koala back to her hometown.

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.832
As the young girl bids her
pirate companions farewell,

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.934
Tiger has hope that
the future may bring

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:25.370
peace between
humans and Fishmen.

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:29.007
Unfortunately, Tiger's past
soon catches up with him

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.744
and he leaves his crew with
a sobering final command.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.379
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:37.582
"The Death of the Hero!
A Shocking Truth of Tiger!"

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.018
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
