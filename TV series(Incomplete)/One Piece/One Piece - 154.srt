1
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:43,658
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,052
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,221
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:12,145
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,106
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,400
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,203
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:35,835
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:40,882
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:45,261
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,266
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,561
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,814
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,899
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,944
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,446
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,159
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,954
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,248
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:27,637
My money says that
we live through this.

30
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,347
A cloud road that
goes straight up?

31
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:31,641
You might wanna
reconsider that bet.

32
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,644
[USOPP, CHOPPER scream]

33
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:39,983
I wonder if this is a natural
formation of the clouds.

34
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,402
There's nothing natural
about this at all!

35
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:44,362
[laughs]

36
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,370
[gasps]

37
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,413
[CHOPPER]
Look! The exit!

38
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,373
They put up a big
sign showing us!

39
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:56,666
[ROBIN]
Godland?

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,419
What is Godland Skypiea?

41
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:04,716
This isn't the exit.
It's the entrance!

42
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,643
[laughing]

43
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:24,736
[LUFFY] "Godland, Skypiea!
Angels on a Beach of Clouds!"

44
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:33,161
[ALL yell]

45
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,753
There it is!

46
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,922
Sky island!

47
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:48,134
[USOPP, CHOPPER gasp]

48
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:55,266
Wait. Didn't the sign
we passed say Skypiea?

49
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,267
[NAMI chuckles]

50
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,019
[NAMI]
Yeah, that's the same name

51
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:01,481
scribbled on the map
that Luffy found.

52
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,733
So I guess that galleon
that fell on us

53
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,610
actually did come here.

54
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,905
The last time they set eyes
on this was 200 years ago.

55
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:12,617
I'm amazed that this place has
stayed beautiful for so long.

56
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,505
Ahh.

57
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:30,093
You can smell the adventure!
Potent as the seaweed in summer!

58
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:31,761
[USOPP]
Wait for me! I like adventure!

59
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,304
It's kinda shallow.

60
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,600
Usopp. Did you hurt yourself?

61
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:38,810
Hello?

62
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:45,608
Hey, is it just me, or is this
whole place made of clouds?

63
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,402
Big fluffy ones!

64
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:48,653
I love this stuff!

65
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,947
[BOTH chuckle]

66
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,366
C'mon! Let's go ashore!

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,534
[USOPP]
Yeah!

68
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,036
[BOTH laughing]

69
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:58,580
Wait! I'm coming with you guys!

70
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,874
Me, too. But I gotta
change first.

71
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:03,793
Luffy, we may have a problem
with dropping anchor here.

72
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,628
There's no seabed at the
bottom of this cloud.

73
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:08,048
You know, I thought about
that, and who cares?!

74
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:08,840
[USOPP chuckles]

75
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,091
I love the way you think!

76
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:10,884
Thanks!

77
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,136
[BOTH laughing]

78
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,305
[CHOPPER]
Me, too! I wanna play!

79
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,891
[LUFFY, USOPP, CHOPPER laughing]

80
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:20,310
[LUFFY] Hop on down and
check this out, you guys!

81
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,936
The beach is actually fluffy!

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,814
[USOPP] It squishes between
my toes like marshmallow mud!

83
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,649
[LUFFY] What the heck
is marshmallow mud?

84
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:27,984
[USOPP] I dunno,
but that's what it's like.

85
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,987
Well, regardless of how
the ground may feel,

86
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:33,156
it sure is an amazing sight.

87
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,783
Better than I imagined it.

88
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,242
It's a piece of work for sure,

89
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:39,746
but I think our shipmates
are overreacting.

90
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,955
[SANJI chuckles]

91
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,457
[SANJI] Bugs me when
they get all worked up.

92
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,210
[laughing]

93
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,128
[ZORO]
When they get all worked up?

94
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:48,463
[thudding]

95
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:51,591
[NAMI] Ow! You're hurting
me! I said I was sorry!

96
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,055
[NAMI] Uh, we forgot
about the South Bird.

97
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,182
We really should've let him go.

98
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:01,142
He'll never survive here.

99
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:02,394
I wouldn't sweat it.

100
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,688
Birds adapt very quickly
to their environments.

101
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:07,440
And if not, there seem to be
some people living up here.

102
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,818
Don't worry about
it. He'll be fine.

103
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:11,403
Yeah. I guess.

104
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,737
Hey, the anchor!

105
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,280
All taken care of.

106
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:15,824
It hit the heavier cloud below,

107
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,909
which is what I think
this place floats on.

108
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,828
[ROBIN] That means that
sky island floats

109
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,538
on a sea of cloudcover.

110
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,540
I wonder if it's
stationary in the sky

111
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:25,500
or if it moves with the tide.

112
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,920
We could sit on deck all day
and pick this whole thing apart,

113
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,548
but, come on, what
fun would that be?

114
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,591
Fact is, most of this
makes zero sense,

115
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,593
so let's make the best of it.

116
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:38,555
[laughs]

117
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,183
[laughs]

118
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,019
This is why we came
here, you guys!

119
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:47,105
Welcome to sky island!

120
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,899
Come on! If I can do
this, so can you!

121
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,735
Just jump!

122
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,362
[ROBIN]
Swordsman, you joining us?

123
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,906
Yeah. I'll be along soon.

124
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,537
The captain smells
adventure. Huh.

125
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,749
I never stopped to think of
any of this as adventurous.

126
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,669
Maybe I should
reconsider my stance.

127
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,630
[splash]

128
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,469
Something about the
squishiness of this island

129
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:20,305
makes me wanna sleep all day.

130
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,933
[LUFFY] Ahoy! This is
your captain speaking!

131
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,561
I must inform you that this
place is too much fun

132
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:29,022
for me to make anymore
captain decisions.

133
00:07:29,105 --> 00:07:30,357
Aye-aye, Captain.

134
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,943
What do you say we just
sit and do nothing? Eh?

135
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:37,447
Nothing sounds like
a plan to me. Denied!

136
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,282
[USOPP]
But "denied" means "no"!

137
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,201
[SANJI]
Such mysterious-looking flowers.

138
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:43,328
I've never seen
anything like them.

139
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:48,166
[SANJI]
I wonder if they're balloon-ish

140
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,584
like that sea monster,

141
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,586
if they'll pop when
I pick one...

142
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:57,300
This is great!

143
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,427
Those Marine losers
can't follow us up here,

144
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,805
so we can all cut loose.

145
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:08,103
[NAMI] Hey, Chopper. What do
you think that is over there?

146
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,522
What?

147
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:14,359
All right, Mr. Giant Fruit,
you're all mine--

148
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,654
Ow, well, that hurt.

149
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:20,115
Why's this thing so hard?

150
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,074
Hey, Usopp!

151
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:21,991
[USOPP]
Yeah?

152
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,910
[LUFFY]
Got some fruit for ya!

153
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,912
[USOPP] You practically crammed
my brain into my chest!

154
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:26,871
What's wrong with you?

155
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:28,915
[LUFFY laughing]

156
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,501
[SANJI]
Wait up, Robin, baby!

157
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:34,796
I've got a present for you.
An island flower.

158
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,174
And one, for, uh... Nami!

159
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,426
Nami, baby!

160
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,096
Where'd you run off to?!
I've got a gift for you!

161
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,347
[NAMI]
Whoa.

162
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,683
I can't believe I'm on
a chair made of cloud.

163
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:49,644
I wonder is they have a factory
that makes all this stuff.

164
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,938
This cloud is different from
the stuff on the beach.

165
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:53,356
It's a lot spongier.

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,649
[SANJI]
Nami!

167
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,151
[ZORO]
I didn't figure on gettin' wet

168
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:57,819
walkin' through clouds.

169
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,946
Huh? What's that?

170
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:03,700
[SUU]
Suu! Suu!

171
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:05,869
[ZORO]
Hm?

172
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:06,745
[ZORO yelps]

173
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,872
[ZORO]
Sorry.

174
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:12,709
Huh. And what do we have
here? Some kinda fox?

175
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,837
[LUFFY]
Huh?

176
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,922
Is that music?

177
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,843
Look. There's
someone over there.

178
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,053
On that cloud!

179
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,555
[growls] Oh, great.
It's another monster.

180
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,098
[CHOPPER] Where's the whistle?
Where's the whistle?

181
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,517
We can ask the Sky
Knight to save us!

182
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,852
No, we can't.

183
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:33,271
That's not who you think
it is. That right there...

184
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,148
...is an angel.

185
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,984
An angel?

186
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,085
Heso.

187
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,103
[BOTH]
Heso?

188
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:16,022
You think she's trying
to say hello?

189
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,232
What does "heso" mean?

190
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:20,443
It kinda sounds like "hello."

191
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:22,153
Suu. Come here.

192
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,030
[SUU]
Suu!

193
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:26,324
[CONIS] Did you come
from the Blue Sea World?

194
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:27,534
[LUFFY]
If that's what you call it.

195
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,869
We sailed up a river
of clouds to get here.

196
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:32,247
Speaking of "here,"
is this is your home?

197
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,374
[CONIS]
Yes, it sure is.

198
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:39,421
And I'd like to welcome you
to Skypiea's Angel Beach.

199
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,673
I bet you'd like to drink that.

200
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,634
[LUFFY]
Mh-hm.

201
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:47,262
The top of a conush
is as hard as steel.

202
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,680
It's impossible to crack,

203
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:52,058
so you have to cut through
the underside, like this.

204
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,520
[CONIS]
Here ya go.

205
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,313
[SUU]
Suu.

206
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,862
If it's that good,
I gotta try some.

207
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:04,821
C'mon, give it to me!

208
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:06,906
[USOPP slurping]

209
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,494
My name is Conis, and
this little one is Suu.

210
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:13,038
She's a cloud fox.

211
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:16,332
If you need anything at all,
please let me be of service.

212
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,792
Yeah, about that.

213
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:21,129
Your eyes are setting
my heart on fi--!

214
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,714
Lay off.

215
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:25,216
Actually, we've got
tons of questions.

216
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,468
I hate to bother you,

217
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,137
but we've never been any
place like this before.

218
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,389
Sure, ask me anything
you wanna know.

219
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:34,142
Guys, look. Something's coming.

220
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, that's my father.

221
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,771
[PAGAYA]
Heso, Conis!

222
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,190
[CONIS]
Heso, Father!

223
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,859
Can't you say hello
like normal people?

224
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,027
[NAMI gasps]

225
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,945
Conis, what's that
thing he's riding on?

226
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,573
Ah, that would be
my father's waver.

227
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,659
[LUFFY]
Whoa! That's awesome!

228
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,328
A sky waver.

229
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,790
[PAGAYA] Gang way! Stopping
this thing is a bit of a trick!

230
00:11:56,873 --> 00:12:00,085
[PAGAYA yelping]

231
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,673
[groans]

232
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,217
[PAGAYA] My goodness.
I-Is everyone all right?

233
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,386
You're the one who crashed!

234
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:12,263
Hey, Luffy, didn't you bring
back something like that waver

235
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,264
from the seabed?

236
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,058
Uh, yeah. I did, didn't I?

237
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,393
Huh.

238
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,144
Then that must be the
boat we read about

239
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,813
in that "Noland, the Liar" book.

240
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:22,148
A boat that can
sail without wind.

241
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:24,651
Did you make some new
friends, Conis, my dear?

242
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,194
[CONIS]
Yes.

243
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,530
They arrived only a few minutes
ago from the Blue Sea World.

244
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:30,281
[PAGAYA]
Oh, still adjusting.

245
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,117
There must be a great many
things that puzzle you

246
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,702
about the White White Sea.

247
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:34,786
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,246
[USOPP]
There's no need to apologize.

249
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:38,790
[PAGAYA] Forgive me for not
introducing myself sooner.

250
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,041
My name is Pagaya.

251
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,127
[USOPP] Oh, it's, uh,
very nice to meet you.

252
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,462
So, Father, how was
the fishing today?

253
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:47,048
[PAGAYA]
Quite a successful venture.

254
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,926
I have an idea. You all
should come over for dinner.

255
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,470
We'll fill your bellies with
the taste of the island.

256
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,848
I'm all for that! I'm starving!

257
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,891
Sky island cuisine?

258
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,435
Do you mind if I help
you prepare it?

259
00:12:58,518 --> 00:12:59,811
[PAGAYA]
No!

260
00:12:59,894 --> 00:13:01,855
Before we go, I have a question.

261
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,816
This boat, it doesn't have
any sails to catch the wind

262
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,609
and you weren't
rowing it either,

263
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:09,404
so how is it propelled
through the water?

264
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,739
Oh, of course.

265
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,366
Your people aren't familiar
with dials are they?

266
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,118
What're dials?

267
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,205
[screams]

268
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,667
[screaming]

269
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,294
[LUFFY]
Why won't it stop?!

270
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:27,213
[LUFFY screams]

271
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:29,632
[CONIS]
Oh, no! I hope he's all right!

272
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:30,884
It's all my fault!

273
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,803
I shouldn't have let a
rookie use the waver.

274
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,055
Since Luffy can't swim,

275
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:37,223
I hope this sea is more
buoyant than ours.

276
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:38,808
Maybe.

277
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:41,686
If it can stay floating in the
air, then you're probably right.

278
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,520
He can handle it.

279
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,606
[LUFFY gargling]

280
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,024
[SANJI]
Huh? He sank.

281
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,650
[ZORO] Eh, it's not the first
time I've been wrong.

282
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:50,653
[CHOPPER]
Ah! I'll save you!

283
00:13:50,737 --> 00:13:51,905
[SANJI]
That was close.

284
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:53,782
[ZORO] Close? You were
standing on the beach!

285
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:55,575
What do you know about "close"?

286
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:58,328
Oh, yeah, and thanks for
all the help, by the way!

287
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:00,747
[USOPP] Was it really necessary
for you to jump in too?

288
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,000
Sky island scary.
Sky island scary.

289
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:06,586
I apologize for letting
him take the waver out.

290
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,421
With its light body,
even a small wave

291
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,006
can shake the rudder.

292
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,592
Unless you know the White White
Sea like the back of your hand,

293
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:15,095
the waver is almost
impossible to ride.

294
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,930
Again, I am sorry.

295
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,724
It's only recently that I
became good enough to ride it.

296
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,935
Whoa! Is it really that hard?

297
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,813
It usually takes ten years
of training to drive it.

298
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,356
You gotta be joking!

299
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,650
Wow! Look at her go!

300
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:29,901
[NAMI]
This is wonderful!

301
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,529
Oh, Nami! You're a vision
riding that waver!

302
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,738
That's incredible!

303
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,032
I can't believe it!
This is her first time?

304
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah! How come she can
do it and I can't?!

305
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:41,496
[NAMI]
Wow! This really requires skill!

306
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,873
No wonder you had
a hard time Luffy!

307
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:46,001
[NAMI laughing]

308
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,711
[LUFFY]
Nami, we're invited to dinner,

309
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:51,297
so get off that thing
and stop being so rude!

310
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,382
[SANJI]
Talk about rude.

311
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,883
[LUFFY]
Stupid waver hog!

312
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,468
[NAMI]
You guys go on ahead.

313
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,971
If it's okay with Pagaya, I'd
like to stay out here and ride.

314
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,557
[PAGAYA]
That's fine. Just be careful.

315
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,684
[NAMI] Riding this freely
on the open ocean

316
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,645
without worrying about
the wind is like a dream!

317
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,815
I wonder if we can use these
on our ocean back home.

318
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:11,484
Whoa. Is that some
kinda factory?

319
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,654
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

320
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:16,072
[PAGAYA]
Indeed it is.

321
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,116
That is our cloud quarry site.

322
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,118
It's where our clouds
are manufactured

323
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:22,495
and cut to meet all
types of needs.

324
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,039
[ZORO] I didn't know
you could cut a cloud.

325
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,540
[PAGAYA]
You did take the Milky Road

326
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,792
to get to the White
White Sea, correct?

327
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,336
[ZORO]
Milky Road?

328
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,087
Is that the name of that messed
up current we took up here?

329
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,172
[PAGAYA]
Yes.

330
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:33,923
It's a canal constructed
by our engineers

331
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:37,177
and made using the natural
clouds we quarry.

332
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,430
There are actually two types of
natural clouds on our island.

333
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:43,141
Your ship traveled atop
what we call sea clouds.

334
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,726
And the ones that
float on their own,

335
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,105
that we can stand on and build
on, are called island clouds.

336
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,192
They're not the normal clouds
that we're used to, are they?

337
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,318
[PAGAYA]
No.

338
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:54,903
Their condensation
nucleus is different

339
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,113
from what you usually see.

340
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:59,616
It has to do with a mineral
found in the Blue Sea World

341
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,993
called Sea Prism Stone.

342
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,203
Sea Prism Stone?

343
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:04,746
What affect does that
have on the clouds?

344
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:05,955
[PAGAYA]
It's like this.

345
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,375
Inside the Sea Prism
are carnelian particles

346
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,876
called pyrobrine.

347
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,544
During volcanic eruptions,

348
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:15,131
these particles gain moisture
and ascend into the sky.

349
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:18,968
Our clouds are formed based on
the density of the moisture.

350
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,012
Oh, yeah. I heard
about those things.

351
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,391
Sure. I remember that
from when I was a kid.

352
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,352
We used to always play with
carnelian particles in the yard.

353
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,646
Enough sarcasm!

354
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,189
In all actuality,

355
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:34,025
there are three types of clouds
that we use in our day to day.

356
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,194
The sea and island
types are natural.

357
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,780
The man-made ones come
from island clouds.

358
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,282
Now if you'll follow me, please.

359
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,410
[LUFFY] Check out the
view from up here!

360
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,744
[CHOPPER]
Look!

361
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:46,413
If you squint, you can see
Nami riding the waver!

362
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:49,416
[SANJI]
Luffy, what are you waiting on?

363
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,877
How come she's so good
at that stupid thing?

364
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,129
Fall off!

365
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,547
[SANJI]
Cut it out!

366
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,424
[LUFFY] Thanks, Sanji!
You just made me bite my tongue!

367
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,341
I'm bleeding!

368
00:16:58,425 --> 00:16:59,467
[SANJI]
Poor baby.

369
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,011
Hey, Pagaya, which
way to the kitchen?

370
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,096
[PAGAYA]
It's right up here.

371
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,809
[coughing]

372
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:10,437
What happened to you?

373
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,274
Well, I saw this stuff sitting
in your fridge, and I, uh...

374
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:18,528
I'd never seen anything like it,
so I tried it, and... and...

375
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:19,779
It tastes like death.

376
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:22,365
Now I'm all dizzy and
my tongue feels swollen.

377
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:23,533
How's it look?

378
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:25,285
Like you drank some
spoiled sauce.

379
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:27,370
[SANJI] Then why did you leave
this stuff sitting around?

380
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:28,705
If something's old,
you throw it...

381
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,790
It sounds like they're
havin' fun in the kitchen.

382
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,376
I bet Sanji's just excited
about sky island food

383
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,879
being such a new thing.

384
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:38,381
So, uh, I was wondering.

385
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:39,758
Could you explain
some more to us

386
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,801
about these dials you
mentioned earlier?

387
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,261
[CONIS]
Sure.

388
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:46,931
But it's complex. I don't
exactly know where to start.

389
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:52,395
Ah. I've never been
this relaxed.

390
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,813
[LUFFY]
Hm.

391
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,316
This doesn't look like a dial.
It's just a seashell.

392
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,026
Yes, at first glance,

393
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,694
but why don't you put it
to your mouth and talk?

394
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,946
[LUFFY]
Like this?

395
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,573
Usopp stinks.

396
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,408
Why do you always pick on me?

397
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,743
[CONIS giggles]

398
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:09,704
[CONIS] Now just press
down the apex of the shell.

399
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:12,374
Wanna tell me what an apex is?

400
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,459
It means vertex
or highest point.

401
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,294
[LUFFY]
Usopp stinks!

402
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,713
Ah! The seashell's makin'
fun of Usopp, too!

403
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,674
What'd I ever do
to you, seashell?!

404
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,008
[CONIS] ...press down
the apex of the shell.

405
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:24,135
Hey, that's a neat trick.

406
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,179
So it can store any
sound and play it back?

407
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,181
Then that shell is
one of the dials.

408
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:30,809
Yes. We call this
one a tone dial.

409
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,560
It is a shell from
the White White Sea

410
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,188
that records and replays
whatever it hears.

411
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,731
[LUFFY]
Ah.

412
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,526
Hey, hold on. I didn't think
there was a bottom to your sea.

413
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,528
Where do these
things live anyway?

414
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:44,489
They live in the shallows
in cloud reefs.

415
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,157
I still don't see
how that little thing

416
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,159
could move your
father's sky waver.

417
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:51,371
Well, that's because this is
the kind that powers the waver.

418
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:54,457
It's smaller, but it does
demonstrate the same process.

419
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,418
Here. Let me show you.

420
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:00,380
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Ohh.

421
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,424
[USOPP] So this one blows
wind out of its backside.

422
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:03,717
Lemme see.

423
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,886
This is called a breath dial.

424
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,847
It allows you the ability
to store the wind

425
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,765
and expel it at your desire.

426
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:13,435
[yells]

427
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,311
[CONIS] The wind capacity
varies depending on

428
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:16,730
the size of the shell.

429
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,482
If you attach the right size
to the stern of a ship,

430
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:21,276
you can move along swiftly.

431
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,362
I've never heard of
anything like that.

432
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,655
I get it now.

433
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:26,906
The waver moved by blowing

434
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,575
a stream of wind
through the water.

435
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:31,870
That waver is fun.

436
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,039
Dials don't just power wavers.

437
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,833
There's also the skating kind,
the board kind.

438
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,168
But I don't go for those.

439
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,003
The waver is about
as crazy as I get.

440
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:42,797
[LUFFY] I wish I was out there
on that thing instead of Nami.

441
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,299
And I could be if I
could just figure out

442
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,633
how to fix the one we have.

443
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,969
How did you ever find
a waver in your world?

444
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,971
Well, it's kinda
hard to even tell

445
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,015
if that's what it is, you know.

446
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,601
That hunk of junk is 200
years old and a total wreck.

447
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,102
There's no way it works.

448
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,855
[CONIS]
That might not be the case.

449
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,566
Dials are made from the
remains of dead shellfish.

450
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:02,776
They can last indefinitely

451
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,819
so long as the shell
itself isn't broken.

452
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,945
You might get lucky.

453
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,155
I told ya so.

454
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,406
[USOPP] You never said
anything like that.

455
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,949
[LUFFY]
I know.

456
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,786
[ROBIN] I'd venture a guess
there are many types of dials.

457
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:13,828
Is this one here?

458
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,206
Yes. That's a lamp dial.

459
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,584
Neat! It lit up from inside!

460
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,712
[CONIS] Right. There are flame
dials that store heat and fire.

461
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,548
Flavor dials that store
various tastes and aromas.

462
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:28,218
And wision dials that store
everything the user sees,

463
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:30,303
which you can watch
again and again.

464
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:34,140
I wanna live in the clouds
for the rest of my life.

465
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:36,976
To be honest, we couldn't really
sustain life here in the clouds

466
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,061
without these dials.

467
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,145
Huh.

468
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:42,607
Our culture has evolved
with the dials.

469
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,401
I suppose in the same
way they evolved

470
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,027
with the White White Sea.

471
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,114
[snoring]

472
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:57,288
[SANJI] Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

473
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,666
We have for you sky lobster
with special sauce

474
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,876
and a side of island fruits
that I can't pronounce.

475
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,128
[LUFFY]
That looks so good!

476
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,921
Let's dig in!

477
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,843
[LUFFY]
Oh, wow! It tastes sweet!

478
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:12,470
[USOPP] I wouldn't have
expected it from lobster.

479
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:13,972
[LUFFY]
Yum!

480
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,937
Hey, guys. Any of you
know where Nami is?

481
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:23,356
I think she's riding the waver.

482
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,691
I don't see her.

483
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,609
She probably went out
too far. She's like that.

484
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,863
Who cares? You should
have some of this!

485
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:32,157
I'm worried. Do you
think she's okay?

486
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,077
I have my concerns, but I can't
say one way or the other.

487
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,496
Uh, what're you talkin' about?

488
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,124
In the clouds, there's a
place called the Upper Yard

489
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,460
that no one is ever allowed
to set step foot on.

490
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,503
It's not too far away.

491
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,590
It would only be a short
trip by waver from here.

492
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,841
I'm afraid your friend Nami

493
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:52,385
might've set ashore there
out of curiousity.

494
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:59,059
They're huge. What is this?

495
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:00,143
[USOPP]
What's so bad that no one

496
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:02,270
can ever go over to this island?

497
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,439
Is it full of monsters?

498
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:05,690
It's sacred ground.

499
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,984
Sacred ground?

500
00:22:08,068 --> 00:22:10,820
But it's so much more
than just that.

501
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:15,367
It's the island...
where God lives.

502
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:30,674
<i>Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

503
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:34,302
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear-blue sky...</i>

504
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,014
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

505
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:45,146
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

506
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,663
<i>When I am alone</i>

507
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:07,502
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

508
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,005
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

509
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:14,801
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

510
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:19,806
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

511
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,267
<i>until I recalled...</i>

512
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,980
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

513
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:30,734
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

514
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:36,531
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...</i>

515
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,497
[NAMI] This is one
creepy looking place.

516
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:46,166
[LUFFY] That's what places
we're not supposed to go

517
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:47,459
usually look like.

518
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,711
[CHOPPER]
You wanna go anyway. I can tell.

519
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,588
[SANJI] Guys, we should
really look for Nami.

520
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,464
[LUFFY]
I'm game!

521
00:23:52,547 --> 00:23:53,757
[USOPP]
But what about me?!

522
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,258
[LUFFY]
Can't say that I really care.

523
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,594
[ZORO] Heh. Looks like we're
headed for another disaster.

524
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,429
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

525
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:01,348
"The Forbidden Sacred Ground!

526
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:04,476
The Island Where God Lives
and Heaven's Judgement!"

527
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,062
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
