WEBVTT

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.118
[cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.488
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.325
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.496
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.772
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.149
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:41.055
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:46.333
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.403
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:52.077
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.015
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.386
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.957
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.765
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.103
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:08.978
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.219
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:16.393
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat

00:03:16.426 --> 00:03:18.664
one of the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.901
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.271
Their current objective is

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:24.442
to destroy a man-made
Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:26.045
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.584
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:32.124
that promises the Flame-Flame
Fruit to the champion.

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:35.197
So? What'd you
need me for, Zoro?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.169
[NARRATOR] Later, Luffy
reunites with Zoro and Kin'emon,

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.007
and the trio
receives a status update

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.715
from the rest of the Straw Hats
via Transponder Snail.

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:45.084
We made some friends.

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:47.556
Guys that call themselves
the King Riku Army,

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.659
sworn enemies of Doflamingo.

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:50.662
[SANJI]
An army?

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:51.796
Of Little People.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.932
[LUFFY]
Really?

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.903
[FRANKY] And the thing is,
this army is planning on

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:59.212
taking down Doflamingo,
like, pronto. Today even.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:00.715
Hold on.

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:02.919
[REBECCA] I believe that
he can save this kingdom.

00:04:02.953 --> 00:04:05.423
But he wants to sacrifice
his life to do it!

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.862
Don't do it!
Tell the army to wait!

00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:09.098
[FRANKY]
Not a chance!

00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:11.737
This little army
is brave as hell.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.443
I can't just leave 'em to die.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:17.180
I'm sorry.

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.288
[REBECCA]
He won't make it this time.

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:22.324
He'll die.

00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:23.059
[LUFFY]
Franky!

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:23.761
Uh?

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:26.600
Kick some ass out there!

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.403
We'll back you up real soon!

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:29.739
[FRANKY chuckles]

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:31.943
[FRANKY]
Wow! Thanks, brother!

00:04:31.977 --> 00:04:33.012
All right.

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:34.782
We're heading back.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.587
[GROUP]
What?!

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.690
It always ends up this way!

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.433
This does not look promising.

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.236
And it's coming this way.

00:04:47.474 --> 00:04:49.345
[BOTH gasp]

00:04:49.378 --> 00:04:50.715
[LUFFY]
Doflamingo!

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:51.448
[groans]

00:04:51.482 --> 00:04:53.554
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.625
Damn brat.

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:56.894
What's going on?

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:59.732
Traffy! Why are
you fighting with Mingo?

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:06.580
You just had to push your luck.

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:24.481
[LAW]
Cora...

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:29.759
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:33.901
[LUFFY] "Two Great Rivals
Meet Each Other!

00:05:33.934 --> 00:05:36.806
Straw Hat and Heavenly Demon!"

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.421
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp, murmur]

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:48.864
Huh? Did I hear a
gunshot over there?

00:05:48.897 --> 00:05:50.000
Are you all okay?

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:51.335
What happened to Traffy?

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:53.206
You still with us, Luffy?

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:55.611
Tell us what's going on, please!

00:05:57.147 --> 00:06:02.525
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.796
[SANJI]
C'mon, Luffy, say something!

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.152
Sorry about all the
commotion, folks. Forgive me.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:17.989
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:06:18.022 --> 00:06:22.364
This is the pirate,
and Warlord, Trafalgar Law.

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:24.301
He's the culprit
behind the false report

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:27.307
of my abdication from
the throne this morning.

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:34.254
He did that?

00:06:34.288 --> 00:06:38.262
[NEWS COO squawking]

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.739
Why would he quit the Seven
Warlords? This is just insane!

00:06:42.772 --> 00:06:44.107
What's going on here?

00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:46.913
But his kingdom!
This can't be good!

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:50.120
[MAN F]
Your Majesty!

00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:51.890
Why would you resign?

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:54.494
All of this is just
happening so suddenly!

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.969
[MAN G] At least tell us
your reasoning! Please!

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:03.981
[DOFLAMINGO] He was attempting
to pull me off the big chair.

00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:05.450
But fear not.

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:07.922
I've taken care of the problem.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.526
That all makes sense now!

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:11.429
So his intent was
to throw Dressrosa

00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:13.466
into a spiral of chaos,
Your Majesty?

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.238
I'm so relieved! We're safe now!

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:24.454
Hey, Mingo!

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.037
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:37.213
[LUFFY] You're gonna pay
for doing that to Traffy!

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:47.000
Listen, kid. You'll mind
your own damned business,

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.338
if you know what's best for you.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:52.444
Don't you know?
Law used to work for me.

00:07:52.477 --> 00:07:55.651
I'm just cleaning
up my own mess.

00:07:55.685 --> 00:07:57.387
[ZORO]
Kin, get Traffy outta here!

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.360
Leave it to me!

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:03.768
Hey, Vice Admiral!
The Pirate Hunter's on the move.

00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:05.705
Should we nab him?

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:07.007
[BASTILLE]
Hm. Sounds good.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.445
[FUJITORA]
Wait, just a moment.

00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:10.781
[CHOPPER]
Hey! Come on, talk to us!

00:08:10.814 --> 00:08:12.852
Please tell us what's going on!

00:08:12.886 --> 00:08:16.326
With heavy heart, I am sad
to report Sir Law has fallen,

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.795
shot down by Doflamingo!

00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.431
[BROOK, NAMI]
What?!

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.770
Hear that? Not good.

00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:24.108
[DOFLAMINGO]
The Pirate Hunter Zoro

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:26.479
and Foxfire Kin'emon, right?

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:30.955
I saw Momonosuke earlier, too--
unguarded aboard your ship.

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:31.723
[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:08:31.756 --> 00:08:33.326
Don't listen to that bastard.

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:34.829
We would never
let him take Momo.

00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:36.432
I never doubted you!

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.337
[chuckles]

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:51.596
[ZORO]
It's you!

00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:56.171
Excuse me.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:01.181
[yells]

00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:08.931
[LUFFY] I knew you were
stronger than you let on!

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:11.201
What's your name anyway?

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:14.643
[chuckles] I guess you
could call it second sight.

00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:16.713
But there's something
that's telling me

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:20.486
not answering you would be
better for both our sakes.

00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:33.312
[ZORO]
What's this intense pressure?

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:37.888
[ZORO] How is he
creating this much force?

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.369
[ZORO yells]

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:50.013
[LUFFY gasps]
Zoro!

00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.919
[KIN'EMON gasps]
Sir Zoro?

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:55.591
[USOPP] What happened
to Zoro?! Kin'emon?!

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:58.329
Sir Zoro just vanished!

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.771
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.078
Kin'emon!

00:10:06.112 --> 00:10:08.918
I'm gonna help you!

00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:13.860
[LUFFY groans] Oh, yeah,
that's Sea Prism Stone isn't it?

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:17.935
[BROOK] Hey, Kin'emon? Are
you okay? Come on, answer me!

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:20.975
Don't tell me that you're dead!

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:23.379
[ZORO groans]

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:30.928
[FUJITORA grunts]

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:37.709
[MARINES gasp]

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.846
[MARINE A]
Vice Admiral!

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.850
How treacherous.

00:10:41.884 --> 00:10:44.188
A long-range sword attack?

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:48.096
Please go inform the civilians
to evacuate as far as possible.

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:50.032
[MARINE B]
Yes, sir!

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:55.677
I can't believe that
the old blind gambler

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.249
turned out to be a Navy
Admiral this whole time.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.186
That guy?!

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.037
So he's with the Navy?

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.641
[BROOK] I
can hear you, Kin'emon!

00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:12.077
Thank goodness!

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.081
That means you're still alive!

00:11:14.114 --> 00:11:16.452
Thank you for your help before.

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.659
I fear I may seem ungrateful,
turning my blade on you

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:23.365
as I am, but I do not
intend to be callous.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:27.274
[FUJITORA] Fate can be a cruel
and ironic mistress at times.

00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:32.250
This man, who stands
here alongside Doflamingo

00:11:32.283 --> 00:11:35.089
is a Navy Admiral it would seem!

00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:37.360
[GROUP]
What?!

00:11:37.394 --> 00:11:38.731
[GROUP]
What?!

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:42.638
Wait, so there's a Navy Admiral
just hanging out in Dressrosa?

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:45.377
Then perhaps,
that means Doflamingo

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.113
is allied with the Navy.

00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:51.155
In that event, we could have
countless enemies to face.

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:53.927
[USOPP] Who cares about
the number of enemies!

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:57.400
Just one admiral is
already a huge problem to us!

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.172
[TOY SOLDIER]
Hmm...

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:08.489
[KIN'EMON grunts]
Don't you dare!

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.887
[FUJITORA grunts]

00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:27.528
[LUFFY gasps]

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:29.566
Wake up! Please, Sir Law!

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:32.538
Are you kidding me?!
Both of them can fly?!

00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:35.777
[KIN'EMON] How are you
fairing? Please answer us!

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:38.984
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Let's have a chit-chat

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:41.589
back at the palace, Fujitora.

00:12:41.623 --> 00:12:43.727
If I can convince you
to cooperate with me,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.499
you'll have their heads in no
time at all.

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:48.937
I shall listen to
what you have to say,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.674
O' Heavenly Demon.

00:12:50.707 --> 00:12:52.711
But the decision remains my own.

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:54.348
I won't let them get away!

00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:56.786
[MARINE B] All civilians
have been evacuated!

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:57.454
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:58.991
[MARINES yell]

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:01.562
[MARINE B]
Capture Roronoa Zoro at once!

00:13:05.437 --> 00:13:07.140
Looks like our
cover is blown, huh?

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:09.378
Yes, that seems to be the case.
