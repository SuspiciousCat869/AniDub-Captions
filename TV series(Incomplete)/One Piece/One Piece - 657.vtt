00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.939
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.116
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.755
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:46.065
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.877
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.814
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.258
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.768
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.403
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:09.044
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.386
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.929
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:21.168
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.774
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:26.412
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.018
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament that

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:31.924
promises the Flame Flame Fruit
to the champion.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.630
Rebecca, a gladiator
Luffy befriended,

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:37.134
is fighting the last match
of the first round.

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:40.073
[LUFFY] She uses
Observation Haki? Sweet!

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.342
[INMATE E]
Haki?

00:03:41.376 --> 00:03:44.281
[GYATS] Rebecca's also never
been wounded during a match!

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:46.252
So far, she's won every fight

00:03:46.285 --> 00:03:49.526
just by letting her foes
fall off the side!

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:55.136
Lucky me. Now I get
to pulverize you.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.342
Let's get this going,
Little Weed!

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:01.984
If I bring Mister Luffy to ya,

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:04.255
then will you give
me your autograph?

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.694
[ZORO]
It'd be a big help if you did!

00:04:06.727 --> 00:04:09.532
[screaming]

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.939
[BARTOLOMEO] I'll bring Mister
Luffy back here if it kills me!

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.441
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]

00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:15.978
[BARTOLOMEO]
You can count on me!

00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:19.017
I won't let you down, I promise!

00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:41.028
Gotta be careful I don't
accidentally bump

00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:44.802
into Mister Luffy. Otherwise,
his awesomeness might blind me.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:47.742
That, or my heart might
burst right outta my chest.

00:04:47.776 --> 00:04:50.949
I need to gaze at him
from a safe distance first.

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:52.785
Whoa, but wait a second.

00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:55.257
Since the captain and his
right-hand man are here,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.461
does that mean the rest of
the crew is on the island?

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:00.969
All my favorites?
Together in one place?

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.172
Like Mister Sniper King!

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.578
Mister "Black Leg" Sanji!

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:07.882
Miss Nami, too!

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:10.186
Their doctor, Mister Chopper!

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.559
And Miss Robin, woo!

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:15.296
Mister Franky,
legendary shipwright!

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.766
And last but not least...

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.573
There's Mister Brook,
the one and only Soul King!

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.177
I can't wait!

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.983
I'll finally get the chance
to meet all my heroes!

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:27.722
Oh, man. I'm losin' my mind!

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:29.324
Speaking of which...

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:32.866
Am I nuts or is this place
way too quiet all of a sudden?

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.805
Never mind Mister Luffy, I can't
seem to find anyone at all.

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.474
What gives?

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.245
There were a ton
of gladiators here,

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:41.617
where'd they all run off to?

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.523
Oh, huh. A staircase.

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.893
Never checked out
the lower floors.

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:52.204
Not gonna lie, it's a
bit creepy down here.

00:05:52.238 --> 00:05:56.546
No way Mister Luffy would hang
out in a gloomy place like this.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.886
Huh. Are those voices?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.623
What is this place?

00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:04.696
Coming though! Hurry up.
Get out of the way!

00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:11.475
[BARTOLOMEO]
A hospital?

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:16.485
Next in line, we're ready!

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.125
They've got quite a crowd
down here, don't they?

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:20.794
Let's take a look.

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:23.366
Seems like everyone here
is either injured or a part

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.139
of the staff, so that pretty
much rules out Mister Luffy.

00:06:26.172 --> 00:06:28.075
[MEDIC F]
Is that Bartolomeo?

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:30.247
This is bad. We don't
need him antagonizing

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.217
these poor people
when they're injured!

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.988
[MEDIC G]
Uh! Mr. Bartolomeo!

00:06:34.021 --> 00:06:35.423
What are you doing
in the basement?

00:06:35.457 --> 00:06:38.664
I'm looking for someone
important, and it ain't you.

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.299
But you shouldn't be here.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.338
This is where
we treat the losers.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.007
And if they see you...

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.881
[BARTOLOMEO]
"Treating the losers"?

00:06:46.914 --> 00:06:48.818
Sounds like a waste of time.

00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:51.389
If they're trash,
just toss 'em out!

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:52.291
[COMPETITORS murmuring]

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:53.493
Bastard!

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:56.132
You Didn't humiliate us enough
in the arena, or what?

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:57.300
Get out of here!

00:06:57.334 --> 00:07:00.106
If you came lookin' for
another battle royale,

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.343
I think we might just
take you up on that!

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:04.448
I think it's better
if you leave.

00:07:04.482 --> 00:07:07.054
Please, sir, don't cause
any more trouble for us!

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:08.791
All right. Fair enough.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:10.460
Besides, it's not
like I'm gonna find

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:13.901
what I'm looking for down here.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.608
Hope youse all get to
feelin' better real soon!

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:23.353
Don't know what he wants,
but at least he's gone.

00:07:23.386 --> 00:07:27.160
[MALE MEDIC B] Next patient!
Mr. Sai from the Kano Kingdom!

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:29.164
[SAI]
What about the last patient?

00:07:29.197 --> 00:07:31.001
You carried our
old man back there

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:33.006
and haven't said
a stinkin' word!

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.210
You mean Mr. Chin Jao?

00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:38.984
If he ain't dead,
then what gives? Huh?!

00:07:39.017 --> 00:07:42.559
Jeez. Shut your trap.
Nobody cares.

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:45.130
I know he's getting old,
so it's no surprise!

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:46.834
Just give me the truth!

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:47.936
If the man's dead,

00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.508
you're supposed to
tell the next of kin!

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.044
Can you keep it down?

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:53.480
[grunts]

00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:55.016
[MALE MEDIC B]
You're overreacting, sir.

00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:58.189
The situation's not nearly
as dramatic as all that.

00:07:58.223 --> 00:08:00.460
There's an exit in the
back of the infirmary.

00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:03.734
After you get treated, you don't
come back to the waiting room.

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:07.073
Oh! I'm sorry! I made such
a big scene over nothing.

00:08:07.107 --> 00:08:08.544
[laughing]

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:11.951
Well, glad we cleared it up.
Now please, go in.

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:15.223
[SAI grunting]
No. You don't understand.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:16.860
I'm sorry for the confusion.

00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:20.333
I feel terrible for
putting you on the spot.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.637
I'm on my knees!

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.908
Asking, begging you
for your forgiveness!

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:25.043
Don't worry!

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.447
He's just a little emotional.
He'll get over it.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.351
[MALE MEDIC B]
Uhm, okay...

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.457
Right this way.
We're ready to see you now.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:36.633
You're Sai?
From the Kano Kingdom?

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:37.936
[SAI]
That's right.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:41.008
Great! Just lie down on the bed
here and we'll get started.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:42.244
[SAI]
Like this?

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:46.019
[MALE MEDIC D] Yes. And you'll
need to close your eyes.

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:47.421
[MALE MEDIC E grunts]

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:50.594
[MALE MEDIC D] All right.
Commencing examination.

00:08:50.627 --> 00:08:52.932
[SAI screams]

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.468
What the hell?

00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.005
[MALE MEDIC B]
Send in the next one!

00:08:56.038 --> 00:09:00.914
[SAI screaming]

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.897
[groans]

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:11.436
What is this stuff?
Buncha dolls?

00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:13.674
Looks like a trash heap.

00:09:13.707 --> 00:09:15.878
Made up of toys and fighters.

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:17.648
[SAI]
Uh! Who's there?

00:09:19.952 --> 00:09:23.326
[SAI]
You? Hajrudin!

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:27.568
All you guys!
What the hell is this place?

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:31.308
You're alive! Well,
that's good news! I'm happy.

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:34.214
[CHINJAO] What part about any
of this is good news, you idiot?

00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:38.255
My guess is, if you lose the
tournament, you're chucked.

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:40.026
Thrown out with the trash.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.765
[SAI] Thrown out?!
What does that mean?

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:44.836
How are we gonna get outta here?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.205
There is no way out!

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:49.245
We were set up by that
bastard Doflamingo!

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:53.485
This is an act of war,
King Elizabello!

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.494
Hate to say, but even my King
Punch can't break us out.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:59.699
You realize we're
underground, right?

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.404
Which means these walls
are solid earth.

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:04.943
Of course your technique
doesn't work, idiot,

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:07.682
we're all strong and none of
our techniques will get us out.

00:10:07.716 --> 00:10:09.418
What's their endgame here?

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:11.388
Are they collecting
fighters or what?

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:12.424
Whatever it is,

00:10:12.457 --> 00:10:15.229
I doubt they plan on
tending to our wounds.

00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:18.537
[CHINJAO yells]

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.876
I will curse you for this
offense, Doflamingo.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.316
I'll curse your children
and grandchildren, too!

00:10:25.349 --> 00:10:30.327
[CROWD cheering]

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.165
Listen to that deafening roar
coming from the crowd!

00:10:33.198 --> 00:10:36.740
I think we all know who's
the fan favorite in Block D!

00:10:36.773 --> 00:10:38.710
Rolling Logan!

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:42.016
And looks like he's set
his sights on Rebecca!

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.254
[laughing]

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:46.760
So many bones, it's gonna
be hard to decide

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:48.495
which to break first.

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:53.841
Maybe something
in the neck? Huh?

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.547
[CROWD]
Go for the neck!

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.619
Or maybe I could snap
her little spine?

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:01.856
[CROWD]
Snap her spine!

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:03.594
No... Wait...

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:06.834
How do the arms and legs
sound to you guys?

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.505
[CROWD]
Much better!

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:13.847
I think we can do
much better than that.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.687
There's no need to pick
favorites here!

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.728
I say her whole body
deserves to be pulverized!

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:23.165
Who here agrees with me?

00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:25.871
Yeah! Smash her!

00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:27.608
[CROWD chattering]

00:11:27.641 --> 00:11:29.779
[LOGAN laughing]

00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:36.860
[LUFFY growling]

00:11:36.893 --> 00:11:38.997
These jerks are pissin' me off!

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.568
What is their deal?

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:43.339
Like I told you,
there's not exactly any love

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.611
lost between them
and our last king.

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:47.849
Sure! But what's that
got to do with her?

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:49.986
He might've sucked,
but she's still nice!

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.725
None of us here
disagree with you.

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:55.598
Rebecca came to me
when I was injured

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.134
and knocking on death's door.

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:01.709
[screaming]

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.915
[INMATE B gasps]

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:08.790
[INMATE B]
She visited me every day,

00:12:08.823 --> 00:12:11.495
and refused to let me give up.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.568
I'm not the only one.

00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:17.206
She was there
for every one of us!

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:26.526
But all the people on the
outside, they refuse to forget

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.162
what happened that night.

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:30.066
Part of me understands why.

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:32.070
Sounds like it's a sad story.

00:12:32.103 --> 00:12:34.509
Yeah. And it's a long one, too.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.677
Never mind then.

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.013
Are you kiddin' me?!

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.785
You can win this, Rebecca!

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:46.666
Well, let's give the crowds
what they want.

00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:54.447
[GYATS] And Rolling Logan
begins his assault,

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:57.989
fueled by the audiences'
cheers for bloodshed!

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:00.360
With his impressive reach,
he's coming at Rebecca

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:03.867
from both sides! They say
Rolling Logan's max grip

00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:06.171
is over a thousand
pounds of pressure.

00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:07.441
Rebecca better watch out!

00:13:07.474 --> 00:13:11.482
If she gets caught in his grasp,
it's all over for her!

00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:13.853
[REBECCA]
This isn't good!

00:13:13.887 --> 00:13:17.728
[LOGAN chuckles]
Leaving so soon?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.747
[GYATS] With barely any effort,
Logan tracks her across

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.686
the arena, cutting her off
and preventing any escape!

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.756
[LOGAN laughing]

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.864
[GYATS] Like prey cornered by
a snake, she has nowhere to go!

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.837
How will Rebecca
get out of this?

00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:43.547
[laughing]

00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:44.414
[COMPETITOR C yells]

00:13:44.447 --> 00:13:46.953
Thanks for letting
your guard down!

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:50.292
Both of you, go to hell!

00:13:50.326 --> 00:13:52.631
[gasping]

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:53.934
[chuckles]

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:57.875
Awfully shameless of you to
strike when my back's turned.

00:13:57.908 --> 00:14:00.580
Well, you must wanna be crushed!

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:04.756
Hey, watch close, cause
I'll do the same to you!

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.295
[COMPETITOR C groaning]

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:10.300
[REBECCA]
Now's my chance!

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.437
[GYATS] What's this?
Rebecca's taken advantage

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.978
of Logan being
distracted and flees!

00:14:16.011 --> 00:14:20.019
[CROWD booing]

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:23.626
[GYATS] She's scurrying across
the arena like a rat!

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:30.273
[GYATS] And Rolling Logan
is giving chase!

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:34.616
Mowing down the other contenders
like a field of daisies!

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:37.120
[MAN A] C'mon, we wanna
see blood, Rebecca!

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:39.625
[MAN B]
Fight back or die!

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:42.998
[COMPETITOR K screams]

00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:45.036
[REBECCA gasps]

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.539
My sword!

00:14:49.178 --> 00:14:52.718
[LOGAN] Once I've got someone in
my sights, they don't get away!

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:55.090
[laughing]

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:58.329
[GYATS] Now that Rebecca's
without her precious blade,

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:01.168
she's left totally defenseless!

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:09.718
[REBECCA gasps, shrieks]

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:18.737
[GYATS] It's over!
Rebecca's finally been caught!

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.076
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:29.158 --> 00:15:33.131
[laughing]

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.478
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:05.362
[GYATS]
Only one question remains:

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:09.839
What terrible fate will Rolling
Logan choose to dish out?!

00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:15.283
What shall I do?
Any suggestions?

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:17.855
I could smash you flat
like a pancake.

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:21.530
No. Wait,
my personal favorite...

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:22.397
[screaming]

00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:24.368
I like the way you scream!

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.204
Try to keep it up, okay?

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:29.144
I wanna squeeze the life
outta you nice and slow,

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:31.348
so don't go dyin'
on me just yet!

00:16:31.382 --> 00:16:33.620
[REBECCA screaming]

00:16:33.654 --> 00:16:35.624
No. Let me at the bastard!

00:16:35.658 --> 00:16:37.427
This might be it for her!

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.030
Fight, Rebecca!

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.970
[GYATS] Looks like this is the
end of her undefeated streak,

00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:43.873
and maybe her life!

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:45.109
[groaning]

00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:49.217
[CROWD] Pulverize! Pulverize!
Pulverize! Pulverize!

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:53.058
Pulverize! Pulverize!
Pulverize! Pulverize...

00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:56.231
[REBECCA]
Soldier... I'm sorry.

00:17:00.472 --> 00:17:03.278
Faster strikes! Pivot your hips!

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:07.554
[TOY SOLDIER, REBECCA grunting]

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:13.599
[REBECCA]
I've had enough of all this!

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:16.271
Today's competition is our one
chance and I'm taking it!

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:17.709
[TOY SOLDIER]
Come to your senses, Rebecca!

00:17:17.742 --> 00:17:19.144
It's a suicide mission!

00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:22.417
This is nothing like the kind of
match you're accustomed to!

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.258
You'll end up dead!
I won't let you enter!

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:30.400
[LOGAN laughing]

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:31.969
[REBECCA grunting]

00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:38.783
[AGILIA]
Unhand Rebecca! You big lout!

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.070
[coughing]

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:53.345
[GYATS]
Just when all hope seemed lost,

00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.750
the smiling gladiator
Agilia decides

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:57.788
to throw her weight
into the fight!

00:17:57.822 --> 00:18:01.796
Saving Rebecca and flashing
one of her trademark grins!

00:18:01.829 --> 00:18:02.998
[AGILIA laughs]

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:04.101
[LOGAN grunts]

00:18:04.134 --> 00:18:07.139
Uh? We owe Agilia
for that one, huh?

00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:10.213
Yeah! You rock!
Old-happy-face!

00:18:10.246 --> 00:18:13.218
I don't think she'd
care for that name.

00:18:14.822 --> 00:18:17.828
That was a close one. You okay?

00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:20.734
I'll live. Agilia, I'm grateful.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.039
Don't go kissing my
buttcheeks just yet.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:24.141
Wake up!

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:26.077
You wanna get the
Flame Flame Fruit, don't ya?

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:29.652
Then fight!
There's a long way to go!

00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:37.200
Now you're picking
favorites, huh?

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.937
Teaming up on me?

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.309
Then I'll send you
to hell together!

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:47.888
This battle isn't like the other
fights you've been in!

00:18:47.922 --> 00:18:51.896
You can't win this time just by
running around, dodging attacks!

00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:53.098
We'll have to see.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.104
[LOGAN grunting]

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:04.220
[AGILIA yells]

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:09.632
[LOGAN grunts]

00:19:09.666 --> 00:19:12.605
[GYATS] And Rolling Logan
overpowers Agilia

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:14.374
with a savage uppercut!

00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:16.546
[LOGAN chuckles]

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:19.919
Agilia, no!

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:21.789
Do me a favor and stay down!

00:19:21.823 --> 00:19:22.658
Huh?

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:26.064
[REBECCA yelling]

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:28.168
[REBECCA]
And lend me your back!

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:33.813
[GYATS] Could it be?
Are we witnessing a first?

00:19:33.846 --> 00:19:36.953
Is Rebecca actually going
to attack an opponent?

00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:40.861
Think you're any
match against me?

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:42.229
Huh?!

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:56.826
[LOGAN grunting]

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.361
What the--?

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:06.478
There's no way! I can't lose!

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.589
[REBECCA panting]

00:20:11.623 --> 00:20:13.092
[GYATS]
I don't believe this!

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.664
Rebecca pulled off
an upset victory!

00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:17.968
She moved with such
speed and agility,

00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:20.372
she fended off
Rolling Logan's attack,

00:20:20.406 --> 00:20:23.813
then caused him to fall
right outta the ring!

00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:28.155
You lured him to attack first

00:20:28.189 --> 00:20:30.193
by making him think you
were going to strike.

00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:32.364
Then you used his
momentum against him.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.604
You're incredible, Rebecca.

00:20:35.637 --> 00:20:39.044
[COMPETITORS yelling]

00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:40.647
[chuckles] You ready?

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.887
[AGILIA grunts] You're facing
the moment of truth now!

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.795
Rebecca! You get to
the finals at any cost!

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:49.699
[REBECCA panting]

00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:51.135
Right!

00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:56.679
[COMPETITORS grunting]

00:20:56.713 --> 00:20:58.983
[panting]

00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:04.294
[LUFFY]
She did it!

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:05.664
[laughs]

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:08.670
All right! Rebecca! Agilia!

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:09.973
Another one down!

00:21:10.006 --> 00:21:12.644
Come on! Almost there!

00:21:15.082 --> 00:21:16.853
[LUFFY] Hey! Get outta
the shot, Cabbage!

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:18.055
Show us Rebecca!

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.459
Damn right! She's the real hero!

00:21:20.492 --> 00:21:23.767
Wait. Why am I watching the
match on this tiny screen?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.472
I'm gonna go cheer for her!
Later, guys.

00:21:26.506 --> 00:21:27.273
See ya.

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:29.010
Oh, one last thing, though.

00:21:29.044 --> 00:21:30.714
When I first got here,
it seemed like everyone

00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:32.918
in the country was happy
and having fun.

00:21:32.952 --> 00:21:35.524
But you guys showed me
how things really are.

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:37.661
What you saw was the
surface where winners

00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:41.669
are living happy lives.
Not like us.

00:21:41.703 --> 00:21:44.474
Doflamingo deems the people
who follow him "winners"

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:47.748
and anyone who disobeys
him "losers."

00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:52.524
His attitude is no different
than the World Government.

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:55.429
The rogues and renegades
are labeled as trash.

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:57.232
And once you sweep them
out of sight,

00:21:57.266 --> 00:21:59.404
your country starts
looking good.

00:21:59.437 --> 00:22:02.577
Well, on the surface, at least.

00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:08.890
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:17.306
Let's go! Treasure hunting time!

00:22:22.016 --> 00:22:25.824
You know, it kinda reminds me
of the country I grew up in.

00:22:25.858 --> 00:22:27.528
Starts with a bad feeling,

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:30.399
then you start noticing
the darker truths.

00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.540
I got a feeling we've got even
uglier surprises waiting for us

00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:36.913
out there. You'd better keep
your guard up, kid.

00:22:36.946 --> 00:22:39.518
No problem! I'll see ya!

00:22:44.293 --> 00:22:47.801
[BARTOLOMEO sighs] I looked all
over the coliseum for him...

00:22:47.835 --> 00:22:49.605
Where did Mister Luffy
run off to?

00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:51.709
I won't let Mister Zoro down!

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:53.713
I would die!

00:22:57.186 --> 00:23:00.727
[BARTOLOMEO screaming]

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.462
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:03.900
[BARTOLOMEO screaming]

00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:09.911
I can't believe I finally
found you! Mister Luffy!

00:23:14.253 --> 00:23:16.491
