1
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,697
This is Grand Jipang.

2
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,567
It's quite similar to a certain
era in a certain country,

3
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,737
but, uh, let's not get
caught up in the details.

4
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,205
Around this time last year,

5
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,140
some nefarious
criminals wandered into

6
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,242
this country and
made quite a stir.

7
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,677
But now things have settled down

8
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,046
and the land is
once again at peace.

9
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,715
The citizens have enjoyed
a happy life ever since.

10
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,050
Until today, that is.

11
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,260
Idiot! Watch where you're going!

12
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,696
Idiot? But you're the
ones who ran into me!

13
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,333
My word! Are you all right?

14
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,702
Huh? Yeah.
There's no time to waste!

15
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:24,238
You know.

16
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,573
Blue Nose Sensei hasn't been

17
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,441
around here much lately, has he?

18
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,677
Nuh-uh. I'm not really
sure what's going on,

19
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,012
but I know he's been super busy.

20
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,454
Who the hell are you guys?

21
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,822
Isn't that--?

22
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,224
Hey! Aren't you with
the Clown Family?

23
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,358
This is bad.

24
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,661
These guys are always
hanging around with Straw Hat!

25
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,229
Did someone call me?

26
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,599
It's hardly even lunch time.

27
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,200
Isn't a little early in the day

28
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,769
to be running around like
there's a party going on?

29
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,771
What in the heck do you want?

30
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,740
Straw Hat! Why are you here?

31
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,243
I think you should
answer his question first.

32
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,445
If you're looking for a fight,
I'm happy to oblige.

33
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,247
Come on, let's get out of here!

34
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,481
I don't see him anywhere!

35
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,482
Yeah. Right.

36
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,784
Looks like our source
must've made a mistake.

37
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,519
Uh. We'll be leaving!

38
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,623
Don't follow us!

39
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,057
What was that all about?

40
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,426
Seriously -- we never
get decent customers.

41
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,362
Grab the salt.
Purify this place!

42
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,563
You got it!

43
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,497
What's up, Onami?

44
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,666
Is today "Annoying
Customers Day" or what?

45
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,500
No more annoying

46
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,502
than our regular
customers, like you.

47
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,037
By the way,
what about your bill?

48
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,971
I just remembered!

49
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,606
There's this place
I've totally gotta be!

50
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,409
Just put it on my tab!
It was delicious! Thanks!

51
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,411
What a mooch.

52
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,680
I need to start reporting
this to his superiors.

53
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,515
Don't worry about it, Sanji-kun.

54
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,317
There's no point
in doing it now.

55
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,185
They'll end up
coming back either way.

56
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,121
And besides, salt's
expensive lately.

57
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,488
All right, then!

58
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,593
So it was that Straw Hat again?

59
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,596
Well, not exactly.

60
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,065
He just happened to be in
that restaurant, that's all!

61
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,600
It's not like he really
got in the way or anything!

62
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,336
I've had it up to here
with this stinking town.

63
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,705
We've had lean pickings
ever since we set foot here!

64
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,206
Well, sir.

65
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,042
Maybe we should just go
to a different town then.

66
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,244
You idiot!

67
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,779
Are you saying that I,
the great Buggy,

68
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,181
should just walk away with
his tail between his legs?

69
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,783
Which one of you
said I should do that?

70
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,217
I'm just getting started!

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,254
Understand me, you bastard?

72
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,722
He's in quite a mood.

73
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,425
He has been on a bit
of a losing streak.

74
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,360
We need to find our mark
and get outta here fast

75
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,529
or we won't be able
to face the New Year.

76
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,041
Hello? Hey, Orika!
How's he doing?

77
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,810
Oh! Hi, Boss! Much better!

78
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,179
He had a little
rice porridge earlier.

79
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,581
I think he'll be on
his feet again in no time.

80
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,419
Is that so? Glad to
hear he's on the mend.

81
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,388
Orika, Pepper and the other kids

82
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,222
have been worried about you.

83
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,191
Let's go outside
and play with them.

84
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,592
But I--

85
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,827
It's okay, Rika.

86
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,695
I'll watch over
Pops for a while.

87
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,230
Well.

88
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,401
Huh? What's that?

89
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,337
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

90
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,039
Pops thinks
I should go play, too!

91
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,506
Come on, then!

92
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,546
♪ Oh, the islands in
the south are warm! ♪

93
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,249

What the heck is that?

103
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,039
Beats me.

104
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,809
A horse maybe?
No, that's not right.

105
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,311
Oh, wait! I know!

106
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:54,548
I believe this thing
is called a "camel".

107
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,784
It doesn't look like
it'd be any good to eat.

108
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,688
What's it doing
out here, anyway?

109
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,389
Hey, are you feeling okay?

110
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,090
You don't look so good.

111
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,528
Seems like you've got a fever.

112
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,129
Hey Boss, do you
think you could help me

113
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,631
carry him back to my house?

114
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,333
We can't just
leave him like this.

115
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,235
He's sick, and hungry, too.

116
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,469
Sure, but I don't know

117
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,537
where you're gonna put him.

118
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,237
Pops is already there.

119
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,572
That doesn't leave much room.

120
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,639
Yeah, but--

121
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,143
We could leave him at
the well in the back alley

122
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,778
down the street,
but if he's hungry,

123
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,514
I think I know just
the place to take him.

124
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,718
I don't care if he's sick!

125
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,119
We can't keep him!

126
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,755
We're running a business
here, understand?

127
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,523
Come on! Who's he gonna bother?

128
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,325
It's not like you
ever have any customers!

129
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,627
Hey! Watch your mouth!

130
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,061
I wish Blue Nose-sensei
was here.

131
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,830
He'd know what to do
at a time like this.

132
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,466
We'll be fine as long
as we have Orika here!

133
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,534
She's used to taking
care of sick patients.

134
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,535
Lame.

135
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,105
I figured camels would
be way cooler than this.

136
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,439
So did I.

137
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,644
Boss! Boss! We're in trouble!

138
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,245
Big trouble!

139
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,713
Listen! Terrible news!

140
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,582
What the hell is that?

141
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,649
It's a camel.

142
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,152
He's sick and Orika's
helping him to get better.

143
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,153
She what?

144
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,154
Don't worry about it.

145
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,689
So anyway. What's going on?

146
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,756
Oh, yeah!

147
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,059
There's some trouble
going down at Orika's house!

148
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,393
Come on! Quick!

149
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,696
At my house?

150
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,631
Hurry up! Get a move on!

151
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,533
I can't believe you
were hiding in this dump.

152
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,635
Did you really think you
could get away from us?

153
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,636
Pops, no!

154
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,038
Please, just leave him alone!

155
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:24,772
He's a sick man!

156
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,973
Shut your mouth!

157
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,275
If you've got a complaint,
take it up with the no-good bum

158
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,377
he vouched for that
skipped town on his loan!

159
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,546
We were simply sent
to collect what was owed,

160
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,515
and now he has to answer for it.

161
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,051
Come on! Leave her!
Let's get out of here!

162
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:37,785
Right!

163
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,486
Hold it right there!

164
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,589
Take your hands off
of Pops, you bastards!

165
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,232
You. How dare you interfere!

166
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,834
You won't get away with this!

167
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,403
Me? You guys are
the kidnappers here!

168
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,805
We're here to collect a debt

169
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,373
and he's gonna answer for it.

170
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,641
It's our right to do so!

171
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,143
He doesn't owe you
or anybody anything!

172
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,678
If you wanna take
him away so bad,

173
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,447
you gotta go through me first!

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,514
Listen, you idiot!

175
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,084
This man is responsible
for a debt plus interest!

176
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,252
He's gonna have to work

177
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,820
until the day he
dies to pay it off,

178
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,555
and there's nothing
a policeman like you

179
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,522
can do about it!

180
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,558
Pops, no! Stop it, you jerks!

181
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,626
Leave him alone!

182
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,427
Orika!

183
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,295
Who the hell is
this little brat?

184
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,231
Do you know her?
Is this your kid?

185
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,167
If you gotta problem,

186
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,470
we'll just sell you
to help cover his debt!

187
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,337
Come on!

188
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,238
Rika!

189
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,339
Boss!

190
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:37,344
Gum-Gum Billy Club!

191
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,681
Yeah! Way to go, Boss!

192
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,351
Fool! Now you've done it!

193
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,152
You'll regret this!

194
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah, we did it!

195
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,489
We showed you!

196
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,823
This isn't good, Boss.

197
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,558
The Clown Family's
not just gonna give up

198
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,726
and back down, you know.

199
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,194
Hey, don't worry about it.

200
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,795
Everything will be fine, okay?

201
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,632
Wow, how horrible!

202
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm glad you're all right.

203
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,735
So.,what happened to Pops?

204
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,304
He's resting right now.

205
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,339
He'll be staying at
my house until he's well.

206
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:06,674
He tried to push
himself and go out,

207
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,276
but I scolded him and
told him to stay in bed!

208
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,113
Pops isn't gonna win an
argument against you, is he?

209
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,451
Looks like the camel's
feeling better now!

210
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,819
Yeah? Good timing!

211
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,288
I just threw together
some leftovers for him.

212
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,189
Come and get it!

213
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,591
Thank you, Sanji-san!

214
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,659
That's nice and all,
but what about my food?

215
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,661
You already had lunch

216
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,129
and you didn't even pay for it!

217
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:29,697
Here you go.

218
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,731
Thanks again!

219
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,665
Aw, man!

220
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:34,134
Those leftovers sure
do look super tasty!

221
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,172
These aren't the leftovers.

222
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,507
They're expensive
gourmet lunches, got it?

223
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,409
Keep your paws off of them!

224
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,382
Hey, what's wrong?
Look, it's food!

225
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,150
Don't you wanna eat something?

226
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,252
If you don't eat,
you won't get better!

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,155
If that camel doesn't want
them, I'll be happy to--

228
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,558
Oh, no you won't! What is it?

229
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,564
What's up? Hey!

230
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,201
Get the hell away from there!

231
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,336
This stuff's expensive
and it's not for you!

232
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,538
Stop eating it, you bastard!

233
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,706
If you don't stop,

234
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,541
I'm gonna make
a meal out of you!

235
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:18,078
Wow, these leftovers
are pretty awesome, Sanji.

236
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,447
If you've got any more,
I'll take 'em all!

237
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,388
You just pissed off
the wrong guy, camel!

238
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,756
I'm gonna slice you into pieces!

239
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,190
Sanji-san, wait a minute!

240
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,692
Please don't blame the Camel!

241
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,428
He probably just thought the
other food looked tastier!

242
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,629
Well, even so.

243
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,131
Who the hell do
you think you are,

244
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,266
coming into my
kitchen like that?

245
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,435
Sanji-san, Onami-san.

246
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,636
Sorry about all this.

247
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,704
Oh, it's no big deal.

248
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,772
Don't worry about it!

249
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,606
Whoa.

250
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,208
You're being awfully
nice today, huh?

251
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,276
Normally, you would've
beaten the crap

252
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,078
out of someone for doing that.

253
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,079
That's true.

254
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,648
But I'm thinking this
might be an act of fate!

255
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:57,818
Here.

256
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,386
Take a look at this.

257
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,256
I bought a ticket for the
Year-End Jumbo Lottery!

258
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,125
The lottery? What's
that got to do with it?

259
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,228
Thirteen fifty-six!

260
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:09,563
The number of the camel!

261
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,599
So that's why you're
being so superstitious!

262
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:12,466
Yep! That's right!

263
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,269
The drawing is
taking place right now!

264
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,306
I sent Usopp over
to check the numbers.

265
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,075
Third place.

266
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,045
One thousand, three
hundred and fifty six!

267
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,646
The number of the camel!

268
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,352
A One Million Ryo-Berry
third prize payout?

269
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,087
Yeah! I triple-checked
the numbers!

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,488
There's no mistaking it!

271
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,758
Can-- Can this be true?

272
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,360
Am I dreaming?

273
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,630
Yes! Now we can
welcome the New Year

274
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,398
without a care in the world!

275
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,833
All of our money
problems are over!

276
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:46,800
Hey! That's amazing!

277
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,569
Guess you won't need
me to pay my tab then!

278
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,436
We all win!

279
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,505
You didn't win anything,
you freeloader.

280
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,173
I told you guys it was fate!

281
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,642
He really did
bring me good luck!

282
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,509
How can I ever thank you?

283
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,280
I know it's not much,

284
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:01,348
but how about I give you
something to eat, huh?

285
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,683
Anything your heart desires.

286
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,385
You deserve it!

287
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,796
Not the lottery ticket,
you stupid beast!

288
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,830
Why would you eat that?

289
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,199
That's a million Ryo-Berries
you're chewing on!

290
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,168
Spit it out!
Spit it out! Spit it out!

291
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,337
That camel sure does
like expensive stuff!

292
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,072
I think that just
cost him his life.

293
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,474
Give it back! Spit it out!

294
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,777
Throw it up already!

295
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,412
My million Ryo-Berries are
stuck in your stupid throat

296
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,112
and I'm not gonna stop choking
you 'til I get 'em back!

297
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,547
If that's a "good luck" camel,

298
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,682
I think his luck just ran out.

299
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,719
I suppose I knew
the answer already,

300
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:42,056
but it seems we're
connected by fate after all.

301
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,190
Honestly.

302
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,092
I wish they wouldn't pull
me into things like this.

303
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,607
I don't appreciate
you showing up here

304
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,476
whenever you please unannounced.

305
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,578
Come on, don't be like that.

306
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,781
If we join forces,
we can put an end to all this.

307
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,583
It's true that I've
been having problems

308
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,285
with that boy, as well.

309
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,187
This is indeed a
good opportunity.

310
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,222
Do it. Don't hold back.

311
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,423
So, Commissioner.

312
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,627
I have your permission to
flashily get rid of Straw Hat?

313
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,396
If a policeman or two
were to suddenly disappear,

314
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,631
I don't think that it would

315
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,532
raise much suspicion
among the locals.

316
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,399
It's his fault.

317
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,202
He brought all of
this upon himself.

318
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,271
I'm more than happy to help you

319
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:32,272
dispose of that
troublesome brat.

320
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,076
Glad we're on the
same page on this one.

321
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,679
Once I finally get rid of
that annoying do-gooder,

322
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,447
you and I will control this town

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,816
and be as rich and
powerful as we deserve!

324
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,718
What a glorious day that'll be.

325
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,487
Indeed.

326
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,656
Some golden cookies
to express my gratitude.

327
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:53,661
You're a bad man!

328
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,762
Not as bad as you.

329
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,040
What's wrong, Cabaji?

330
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,575
It's nothing.
Just my imagination.

331
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,445
Then don't scare me
like that, damn it!

332
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,280
S-sorry, sir.

333
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,550
I'm busy! So busy!

334
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,653
It's terrible! So terrible!

335
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,822
Boss! There's trouble!

336
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,058
Sorry, he's not here right now.

337
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,093
I sent him out on a delivery
with that camel.

338
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:26,660
What's wrong?

339
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,162
Aw, what crappy timing!

340
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:31,165
Orika was just kidnapped by the
Clown Family!

341
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,400
She was grabbed out of the blue

342
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,202
by those creeps on her way home.

343
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,038
Seems like they were after
her from the very beginning!

344
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:40,507
Hey! Straw Hat!

345
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,376
You jerks again?

346
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,310
Listen up!

347
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,311
We got that little girl

348
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,181
and we're gonna sell her
off to repay that debt!

349
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,216
What are you talking about?

350
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,518
Orika.

351
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,353
She'll be sailing off from
the harbor any moment now.

352
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,588
There's not much time
left for you to rescue her.

353
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,657
What are you doing?

354
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,626
Let me go! Let me go!
Put me down!

355
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,261
Oh, give it up already!

356
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,428
You have the important honor

357
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,197
and privilege of being my bait

358
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,365
to lure out Straw Hat.

359
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,767
And, because all this is to
collect on an unpaid debt,

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,036
what I'm doing is totally legal.

361
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,038
If Straw Hat tries to
raise a hand against me

362
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,105
in front of the Commissioner,

363
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,675
he'll be arrested, fired,
and exiled immediately.

364
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,811
Plus, I'll get a nice sum
of money from selling you off!

365
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:22,382
You'll get yours,
Straw Hat! Just wait!

366
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,019
Hey! Buggy!

367
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,690
You've no business
with Orika! Let her go!

368
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,825
Oh, but I do have
some business with her!

369
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:32,859
This little girl will be acting

370
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,796
as collateral on an
outstanding debt I'm owed.

371
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,631
You have no right
to butt into this,

372
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,700
so don't even try to interfere!

373
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,368
Let's move out, men!

374
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:41,935
Yes, sir!

375
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,670
Help me, Boss! Save me!

376
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,774
I said--

377
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:50,744
Let her go!

378
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,659
You just screwed up, Straw Hat!

379
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,595
A policeman attacking
an innocent citizen

380
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,331
in the town square
over personal matters?

381
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,132
Hey! Did you see
what just happened?

382
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:16,002
What do you think
about it, Commissioner?

383
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,241
I must say, I'm terribly
disappointed in you, Straw Hat.

384
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,642
How could you
have done something

385
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,177
so completely reckless?

386
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,045
The Commissioner!

387
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,413
What the heck is he doing here?

388
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,381
The Commissioner?

389
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:27,948
Yeah!

390
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:28,782
He's just like our boss,

391
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,318
Koza-sama, only
even more powerful!

392
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,420
This guy's the top of
the heap around here!

393
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,355
Whoa!

394
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,656
To think that a policeman,

395
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,591
someone whose
responsibility it is

396
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,227
to keep the citizens safe,
would actually attack

397
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,796
one of them without
provocation is unacceptable!

398
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,897
Straw Hat Luffy!

399
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,667
I am relieving you of
your duties as a policeman!

400
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,302
Consider yourself fired!

401
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:49,570
You are to leave this country

402
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,171
and never set foot here again!

403
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,706
Effective immediately!

404
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,507
What? No way!

405
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,711
You heard him, Straw Hat!

406
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,746
That's what you get for always

407
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,048
sticking your nose
in my business!

408
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,284
Thanks so much for
all your hard work!

409
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:05,085
Now, if it's not
too much trouble,

410
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,421
hurry up and get
the hell outta here!

411
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:09,723
Wait, what are you
two talking about?

412
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,790
Why would I be in trouble

413
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,661
and have to leave here
for trying to save Orika?

414
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,362
It doesn't make any sense!

415
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,797
You're still trying to save her?

416
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,632
What part of this do
you not understand?

417
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,167
It's unseemly, Straw Hat.

418
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,402
Are you attempting
to talk your way

419
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,370
out of everything
you've done here today?

420
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,237
If you prefer,

421
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,473
I can call your
superior here right now.

422
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,475
Though you'll
likely be arrested.

423
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:32,345
You're the one who should
be arrested, Commissioner!

424
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,583
A town Commissioner
joining forces

425
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,085
with petty criminals?
It's inexcusable!

426
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,120
I'm removing you from
your post immediately!

427
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,122
What in the--? Who are you?

428
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,390
How dare you speak to me

429
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,059
in such an insolent manner!

430
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:47,394
The audacity! You'd
best watch your tongue!

431
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,463
You're speaking to the
highest authority here!

432
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,798
Hey. Isn't that--?

433
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:53,834
Impudent fool! Kneel! Now!

434
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,236
Just who do you think
you're addressing?

435
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:58,472
This is the daughter of
the great shogun Cobra!

436
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,141
Her majesty, Princess Vivi!

437
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,644
Now! Show respect!

438
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,679
Kneel down before her!

439
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,651
Your majesty!

440
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:13,587
Vivi!

441
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,555
Vivi!

442
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,623
I knew it was you!

443
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,391
Hello, everyone.

444
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,492
It's been a while.

445
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,562
So, what brings you all
the way out here, Princess?

446
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,430
Our investigation has revealed

447
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,366
that you took a bribe
from the Clown Family

448
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,234
and are working with them
in an attempt to trick

449
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,070
and discredit the policeman,
Boss Straw Hat Luffy.

450
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:32,306
I suggest you
surrender peacefully.

451
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,541
Yes, your majesty!

452
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,678
You spineless, sniveling,
good-for-nothing jerk!

453
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,345
To hell with it!

454
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,213
Now that it's come to this,

455
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,814
I'll just take the
girl as collateral

456
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,116
and get outta here flashily!

457
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:43,484
Like I've been
trying to tell you.

458
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,119
You have no business with Orika!

459
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,553
You can't use her as collateral!

460
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,322
She's not his daughter!

461
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,558
Come on! This way!

462
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,593
Hurry!

463
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,194
But she always calls him "Pops!"

464
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,329
That clearly makes
them father and daughter!

465
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,731
There they are! Look!

466
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,633
Boss! I brought him!

467
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,669
Great! Thanks a lot, guys!

468
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,140
Whoa! Hey, look! It's Pops!

469
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,508
I heard you got sick
and collapsed!

470
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,043
So are you feeling any better?

471
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:10,644
Don't push yourself
too hard, Pops!

472
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,745
Things just aren't the same

473
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,447
at Pinwheel without you, Pops!

474
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,549
Let's get together for
a drink sometime soon!

475
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:16,483
Okay, Pops?

476
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,652
In this town, everybody
calls him "Pops".

477
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,853
It's kind of like a nickname.

478
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,723
There's nothing weird about
Orika calling him that, too.

479
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,092
Now, wait a minute!

480
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,828
He was sleeping at her house!

481
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,496
Pops caught a cold a while back.

482
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,533
It got worse, and one day,
he collapsed in the street.

483
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,735
Orika happened to be
walking by and found him.

484
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,636
It's in her nature

485
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,206
to wanna help people
in need like that.

486
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,476
You're saying that this girl has

487
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,445
no connection
with the debt at all?

488
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,480
That's what I've been
trying to tell you, dumbass!

489
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,148
Well, if that's the case.

490
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:51,117
You're just a no-good kidnapper!

491
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,122
Mommy!

492
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,128
And with that,
it's time for you to go.

493
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,732
See ya later, Buggy!

494
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:10,770
Now Gum-Gum Bazooka!

495
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:14,608
Thank you for your hard work!

496
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:22,516
You mean this camel
is our lord's pet?

497
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,483
Yep!

498
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,053
Eyelash has been missing
for quite some time.

499
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,721
We've been looking
for him everywhere.

500
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,624
The reward for finding him
is one million Ryo-Berries.

501
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,059
What?

502
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:34,528
No way! Vivi, are you serious?

503
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,797
Indeed! That reward
money is all yours!

504
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,565
All right!

505
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,601
I hate to point out the obvious,

506
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:43,137
but isn't that reward money
technically Orika's?

507
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,638
That's okay!

508
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,106
I think we should share it!

509
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,708
We all took care
of him, didn't we?

510
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,310
Isn't that right, Mom?

511
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:50,511
Yes. That's right, dear.

512
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,414
Aw! I love you, Orika! Right!

513
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,682
Then we should celebrate

514
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,216
with a big party tonight!

515
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,585
It'll be Pops'
recovery party, too!

516
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:04,758
You didn't know?

517
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,226
In places all over the world,

518
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,696
today is a holiday
they call Christmas Eve!

519
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:11,432
It's nice to be festive
every once in a while, right?

520
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:13,734
Hey, Onami-san?

521
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,703
May I ask you for a favor?

522
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:16,704
What?

523
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,305
Believe it or not, Orika found

524
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,673
another person passed
out in the street.

525
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,608
We already brought him here,

526
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,076
but he's waiting outside.

527
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,611
Would it be okay
to bring him in?

528
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,312
Another one?

529
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,686
So hungry.

530
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,620
Hey there, monk!

531
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,623
If you don't mind
a foreign celebration,

532
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:37,524
you're welcome to
come inside and join us!

533
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:38,692
There's lots of good food!

534
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,628
Sure. That'd be nice.

535
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:41,762
Good deal!

536
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,064
Now that that's settled,
let's get this party started!

537
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:49,236
By the way, has anyone
seen Blue Nose-Sensei?

538
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,704
He seems really busy lately.

539
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:51,705
You know, since
he can understand

540
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:54,141
what animals say, I wish
he'd been around more.

541
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,376
We could have solved
Eyelashes' problem

542
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:56,443
a whole lot sooner!

543
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,511
Yeah! That's true!

544
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,446
No doubt about it!

545
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:02,249
Sorry, everyone!

546
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:05,185
Today's a really busy
day for reindeers!

547
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,059
Boss! It's terrible!

548
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:13,093
There's trouble! Big trouble!

549
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,261
Things just keep getting worse!

550
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:15,095
Awww, come on!

551
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,463
Have a rice cake
and calm down, okay?

552
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,299
This is about rice cakes!

553
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,401
They're having a rice cake
throwing festival at the castle!

554
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:22,202
One of them has an
amazing treasure inside!

555
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,305
It's gonna be chaos,
I'm telling you! Chaos!

556
00:23:24,338 --> 00:23:25,005
Oh, that!

557
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,340
Our lord asked us to protect it.

558
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,541
Keep an eye on things for him.

559
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:28,508
Ah, okay.

560
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,177
Well as long as we're
not--wait a minute!

561
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,144
On the next One Piece:

562
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:34,281
"A Big Rice Cake Tossing
Race at the Castle!

563
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:34,748
Red

564
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:37,784
I'm gonna be chief
of the police!
