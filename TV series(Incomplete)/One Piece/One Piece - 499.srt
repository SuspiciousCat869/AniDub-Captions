1
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,524
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,261
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,862
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,865
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,399
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,169
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,838
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,874
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,643
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,279
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,880
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:03,817
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,620
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,956
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,160
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,931
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:24,070
[NARRATOR] Unable to save Ace's
life during the War of the Best,

18
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,874
the injured Luffy was
taken to Amazon Lily,

19
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,443
where he fell into despair.

20
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:32,880
But this is a story
from ten years ago.

21
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,950
Ace, Sabo, and Luffy prepare
for battle with a giant tiger

22
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,387
to decide which of the
three is best suited

23
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,588
to be a pirate captain.

24
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,159
While out hunting, they meet
a former captain named Naguri,

25
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,828
who once challenged Gold Roger.

26
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,731
At Luffy's request, he agrees
to share some of his wisdom.

27
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,071
[LUFFY] "The Battle
Against the Big Tiger!

28
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,340
Who Is Going to Be Captain?!"

29
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,815
[ACE, SABO yelling]

30
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,159
How did you think
that was a good plan?

31
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,996
We could've snuck around behind
it, or, I don't know, anything!

32
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,698
[yells]

33
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,865
[ACE gasps]

34
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,637
Yeah, 'cause your idea
worked out great!

35
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,707
[SABO grunts]

36
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,576
[screams]

37
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:45,719
[ACE, SABO screaming]

38
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:52,559
[SABO sighs]
Okay, not our finest hour.

39
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,195
Let's put some poison mushrooms
in the bait tomorrow.

40
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,665
That should slow him down.

41
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,067
Hold on a sec,
that tiger may be big,

42
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,637
but at the end of the day,
he's still a cat, right?

43
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,706
So, what d'you say we
give catnip a try?

44
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,243
Hello?

45
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,014
[SABO]
I wonder how Luffy's doing

46
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,982
with his "secret training."

47
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,720
I dunno if you noticed, but it's
been a whole week since he left.

48
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,789
We should probably pay him
a visit, don't you think?

49
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,392
Uh, you know how he can be.

50
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,361
Maybe the training
is too hard on him

51
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,631
and he's like,
"No, I just wanna go home!"

52
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,167
Wait! What if we haven't
heard anything from him

53
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,070
'cause he's dead already!

54
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,682
What, Sabo?

55
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,983
Oh, come on!

56
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,686
Don't you care about
your little brother at all?

57
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,222
Stop playing cool!

58
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,690
Shut up!

59
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,660
He's the one who left--
it's not my problem if he dies!

60
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,230
Listen, I don't know who you're
trying to impress with this,

61
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,066
--[creaking]
--but Luffy--huh?

62
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,567
[gasps]

63
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,069

[BOTH screaming]

[BOTH groaning]

66
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,343
What the hell?

67
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,478
[LUFFY]
Oh, oops!

68
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,814
Sorry! You okay?

69
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,017
[gasps]

70
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,719
[BOTH gasp]
Luffy!

71
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:30,491
[gasps] Ace! Sabo!
Hey! What's up, guys?

72
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,459
How have you been?

73
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,495
[SABO chuckles]
Uh, pretty good!

74
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,372
[SABO]
What's that? A target?

75
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,341
[LUFFY]
Oh, you noticed, huh?

76
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,642
[LUFFY giggles]

77
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,846
Now, lemme show you the
moves I've been working on!

78
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,283
Here we go! Gum-Gum...

79
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,152
...Pistol!

80
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:00,453
[gasps]

81
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,889
÷[{SABO]
Uh--

82
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,457
Huh? [groans]

83
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,630
[gasping]

84
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,165
Uh-oh!

85
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,435
[laughs] Not bad at all!

86
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,404
Your aim still sucks, but your
reach has gotten pretty far!

87
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,107
[LUFFY laughs]
I meant to do that!

88
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,941
Not this again.

89
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,079
What kind of "special training"
have you been giving him?

90
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,114
None, really. To be honest,

91
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,317
I've just been having him
chop some wood every day.

92
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,953
All the work might've helped
him build a bit of muscle,

93
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,355
but I can hardly
take credit for that.

94
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,363
My men, at the height
of our strength,

95
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,198
challenged Roger to a fight.

96
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,965
Really?

97
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,567
A fight that we lost.

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,634
[LUFFY]
Hm?

99
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,303
Put in our place,
we all split up.

100
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,810
[ACE]
You hate him, too, don't you?

101
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,579
I don't follow.

102
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,815
Because he defeated
your old crew.

103
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,351
Oh, you mean Roger. I see.

104
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,822
I was rather devastated,
that much is true.

105
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,790
But the only reason
I lost to Roger

106
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,260
was because I wasn't
strong enough.

107
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,997
In that respect, he taught
me a valuable lesson.

108
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,832
What, by kicking your ass?

109
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,067
In a way, yes.

110
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,544
[NAGURI] We surrender.
We never stood a chance.

111
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:33,046
Cut off my head, I don't care!

112
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:37,050
But please, please,
spare my crew in return!

113
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,821
I take responsibility
for our foolishness.

114
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,090
[NAGURI PIRATES]
Captain, no!

115
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,058
I beg of you!

116
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,665
[NAGURI]
Huh?

117
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:58,271
Gold Roger was a man of
extraordinary character indeed.

118
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,874
And that's why I say he--

119
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,141
Stop lying!

120
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:04,211
If he's so great, then why
does everybody hate him, huh?

121
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,579
[PIRATES laughing]

122
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,515
[laughing]

123
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,651
[NAGURI]
Did those men fight with Roger?

124
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,620
Did they even meet
him face-to-face?

125
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,889
In the world of pirates,
if you lose a fight,

126
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:20,360
you lose your life, and yet,
Roger chose to spare mine.

127
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,331
So, if those pirates did face
him, they should be grateful.

128
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,501
Complaining like that
is a luxury, you know.

129
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:31,471
One they only have because
their lives were spared.

130
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:32,773
You watch--I'll get
even stronger!

131
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,241
[ACE]
If Roger had a son,

132
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,443
you think he should
be grateful, too?

133
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,551
Actually, I'd feel
sorry for him.

134
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,818
Regardless of his path,

135
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:48,222
his father's name would
haunt him wherever he went.

136
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,289
With a legacy like that,

137
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,891
I wouldn't blame him
for resenting the man,

138
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,362
and it's not like he could
talk it out with him, either.

139
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:59,500
At any rate, if I were his son,
I wouldn't want to be a pirate.

140
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,334
His name could scarcely
do me any favors

141
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,869
and more likely than not,

142
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,738
it would put a
target on my back.

143
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,874
What the hell do you know, huh?

144
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,477
I'm sick of hearing
your crappy lectures.

145
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,778
You really think you're
some great pirate?

00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,781
Prove it! Fight me!

Whoa! What?

149
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,220
I'd be careful, boy.

150
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:22,923
Like I said, you lose a fight,
you lose your life.

151

00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:49,183
Spare me another lecture
and just finish me off!

158

I'll spare you the lecture
and a violent death

159

this place is pretty cool.

00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,834
This is why you collected
all those parts?

177
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,204
Since I've been working all
alone, it's gone a bit slow.

178
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,540
Anyhow, you boys
are pretty tough.

179
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,108
Do ya think you could
lend me a hand?

180
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,209
[ACE, SABO]
Huh?

181
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,810
Why would I do that?

182
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,379
[NAGURI]
Because I spared your life,

183
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,648
you ungrateful little snot.

184
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,286
That's fine for Ace, but how
did I get looped into this mess?

185
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,488
Well, you did follow us.

186
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,991
What is this,
a child labor scheme?

187
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,160
I'm too busy hunting that tiger
to waste time on some ship!

188
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,029
[NAGURI] I can give you
some tiger-hunting pointers

189
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,097
if you stick around.

190
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:12,233
[SABO]
Yeah? Hmm.

191
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,833
Okay, maybe.

192
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:17,337
[ACE]
I got one question.

193
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,773
What are you gonna do
when the ship is done?

194
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,877
Ha. I'm taking it
to sea, of course.

195
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,481
To find my crewmates that
split up all those years ago.

196
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,083
You sure you're up to that?

197
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,183
And why not?

198
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,585
I was a captain once.
I'm hardly some rookie.

199
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,956
I know. That's kinda
what I'm saying.

200
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,524
[NAGURI]
No matter how old you are,

201
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,927
you can always chase your dream.

202
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,230
I'm sailing again and
nobody can stop me!

203
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,033
Once a pirate, always a pirate.

204
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,768
You kids got a
problem with that?

205
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,336
[LUFFY giggles]
Nuh-uh!

206
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,473
Heh, heh. Well,
I'm not gonna stop you.

207
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,542
Hm? Ace?

208
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,712
You spared my life--
what can I say?

209
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:00,314
I'll help you build
your ship. For now.

210
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,448
[NAGURI]
Hm?

211
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,817
'Cause I'm beating you tomorrow.

212
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:07,520
That's Ace for you.

213
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,789
[NAGURI]
Heh.

214
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,962
[ALL grunting]

215
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,397
[NARRATOR] And thus, begin
their training with Naguri--

216
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,567
building his ship
day in and day out.

217
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,704
With every heavy log they
lifted, they grew stronger.

218
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:27,107
And with every sparring match,
they honed their skills.

219
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,875
Although the work was intense,

220
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:33,080
bit by bit, they learned what
it truly meant to be a pirate.

221
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,284
[NARRATOR] Spring always seems
to arrive late in Gray Terminal,

222
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,219
but even the most
stubborn of snow

223
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,322
eventually gives way
to warm weather.

224
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:50,531
[BOTH grunting]

225
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,932
[ACE]
I'm not losing!

226
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,167
[SABO]
Yeah? Neither am I!

227
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,434
[yawns]

228
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,802
[LUFFY]
I'm beating both of you!

229
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,404
Get ready!

230
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,039
Now, Gum-Gum...

231
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:00,674
...Pistol!

232
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,144
[NAGURI gasps, groans]

233
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,912
Aw, jeez.

234
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,382
[LUFFY gasps]

235
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,918
Every damn time!
What is wrong with you?

236
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,520
[LUFFY giggles]
Sorry!

237
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,788
Listen, boys.

238
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,957
You've done this enough already.

239
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,159
There's more to being a pirate

240
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,627
than just whacking
everyone with a pipe.

241
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,197
Surely you want
more than strength.

242
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,098
Yeah, all that stuff can wait.

243
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,433
Right now, we wanna be strong,

244
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,868
'cause the strongest one of
us gets to be the captain.

245
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,871
Why d'you think
we're training, huh?

246
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,840
Remember? Whoever
beats the tiger wins!

247
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,776
The tiger again.

248
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,244
I agree that a captain
needs to be tough,

249
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,215
but there's something more
important than that, you see.

250
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,117
A different kind of strength
that can triumph over any foe.

251
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:45,019
[ALL gasp]

252
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,620
Can you teach us that?

253
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:49,256
Oh? Curious, are you?

254
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:56,696
It slips my mind. [chuckles]

255
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,835
[SABO] There's no secret!
You're making stuff up!

256
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,170
[NAGURI]
No, I really forgot!

257
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,938
[NAGURI chuckles]

258
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,994
[LUFFY snoring]

259
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:34,000
[thudding]

260
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,646
Hm? Can't sleep?

261
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,114
I'm sorry if my
hammering's too loud.

262
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,354
What, is something the matter?

263
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,858
[ACE] What does it take
to be a captain?

264
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:00,060
If there really is a way
for me to be stronger,

265
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,361
I have to know what it is!

266
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,363
So just tell me!

267
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,133
All right then.

268
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,570
[NAGURI]
I'll be honest.

269
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:16,009
Even after all these
years, I'm not sure.

270
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,145
Frankly, I don't think
I was a very good captain.

271
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,684
But my crew, they still
followed me. Heh.

272
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:28,255
Right to the end, they called me
"captain" without any doubt.

273
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,024
And so, in a way,

274
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,660
I'm still Captain of
the Naguri Pirates.

275
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:34,261
Not because of my strength,

276
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,663
but because of the
approval of my crew.

277
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,333
That's the true test
of a captain.

278
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,468
Or so I always say.

279
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,172
Ha. Bunch of crap.

280
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:46,573
Huh?

281
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:04,058
[gasps] All right! We did it!

282
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,860
Okay. Not bad! I'm jealous.

283
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,729
Awesome! Too cool!

284
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,065
I couldn't have done it
without all your help.

285
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,967
Thank you, boys.

286
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,903
I really mean that.

287
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,938
[LUFFY giggles]

288
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,706
So is this it?

289
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,174
Like, are you leaving now?

290
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,144
Not yet. I have one
last loose end.

291
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,880
I think it's about
time we finish

292
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:27,915
that training of yours, eh?

293
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,284
So, are you boys ready to
go tiger hunting or what?

294
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,452
--[LUFFY, SABO gasp]
--[ACE] Hmph.

I'm gonna kill him

297
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,324
and put this crappy training
behind me for good!

298
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,459
[SABO]
Yeah, except I'm gonna kill him!

299
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,628
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna double kill him!

300
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,674
Here it comes.

301
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,718

hasn't gotten any smaller.

00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:08,956

So heavy! I thought
we were strong!

No, there's still one
thing none of us have.

Huh?

331
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,483

Not because of my strength,

00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:46,520
because of the
approval of my crew.

333
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,656

too far to give up now!

finally getting interesting!

We're not fast enough on our
own, but with Luffy's powers,

338

maybe we can make
something happen.

00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:30,698
You're gonna be okay!

353
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,400
Just a little bit more
and he's history!

354
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,570
[SABO panting]

355
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,505
[SABO screaming]

356
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,741
You know what we're
doing next, right?

357
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,142
Uh-huh!

358
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,144
[SABO grunts]

359
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,680
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

360
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:48,849
...Rocket!

361
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:53,353
[yelling]

362
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,905
[ACE, SABO, LUFFY]
All right!

363
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,973
Wait.

364
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:16,810
We just helped Ace
be the captain. [sighs]

365
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:19,613
But we worked for like a
million years on this! Aww!

366
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,716
That's the deal. We all agreed.

367
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,619
Dammit. Stop your complaining.

368
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,888
I'm not gonna be the
stupid captain, okay?

369
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,156
[BOTH]
Huh?

370
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:30,658
But why not?

371
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,160
[ACE]
I dunno, it doesn't feel right.

372
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:35,729
You two kicked as
much ass as I did.

373
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,097
Fair enough.

374
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,633
Well, for now,
but one of these days,

375
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,169
I'm gonna kick so much ass,
it'll blow your mind

376
00:21:42,203 --> 00:21:44,772
and you're both gonna be
begging to join my crew.

377
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,040
Are you gonna beg?

378
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:47,708
Over my dead body!

379
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:49,510
What? Just you wait!

380
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,212
[LUFFY, SABO laughing]

381
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,415
I couldn't have asked
for a better ending.

382
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:57,217
My work here is done.

383
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,019
So long, boys.

384
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:00,454
[ACE]
Naguri!

385
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,455
[NAGURI]
Hm?

386
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,790
I know you're old,
but you can't die yet!

387
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:07,061
I still want a rematch!
I never did get to beat you!

388
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:09,629
[LUFFY giggles]
See ya!

389
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:12,466
Bon voyage and good luck!

390
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,970
Heh. I have a feeling
we'll meet again. Soon.

391
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,555
[NARRATOR]
Thus, they bid farewell

392
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,225
to their teacher, Naguri.

393
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,195
A little stronger
and a little wiser,

394
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:44,831
they continued on their
path to be pirates.

395
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:53,374
[BLUEJAM] I trust you know
where we can find the boy?

396
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,710
[BLUEJAM PIRATE A] Yes, sir.
I've kept a close eye on him.

397
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,279
[BLUEJAM] I think we've
waited long enough.

398
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:03,083
Why don't you call him
and share the good news?

399
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:04,785
Let him know that...

400
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,786
..Sabo's coming home.

401
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,228
[NARRATOR] Sabo's days of
adventure come to an end

402
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:17,498
as he is forced to
remain in High Town,

403
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,099
apart from his friends.

404
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,935
However, fate soon brings
the three boys together again

405
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,938
as Luffy and Ace take on
work for the pirate Bluejam

406
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,108
and Sabo uncovers a
terrifying conspiracy.

407
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,043
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

408
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,545
"Freedom Taken Away!

409
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,281
The Nobles' Plot Closing
In on the Brothers!"

410
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
