1
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:38,024
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,761
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,064
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,866
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,570
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,171
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:54,274
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,077
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,913
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,347
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,817
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,887
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:10,357
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,393
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:18,565
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,803
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,039
Luffy has finally arrived
at Marineford

18
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:28,442
to rescue his brother, Ace.

19
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,044
In their attempt to save Ace,

20
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,645
the Whitebeard Pirates
have launched

21
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,982
an all-out assault on any Marine
standing in their way.

22
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,051
And now the battle is really
starting to heat up!

23
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:45,559
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Giant Rifle!

24
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,031
[LUFFY yells]

25
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,866
Hey, Ace!

26
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,544
[PIRATES cheer]

27
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,248
[PIRATE AA] He toppled
a giant all on his own!

28
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,482
Hell yeah, Straw Hat!

29
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,151
You took him down
with one punch!

30
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,253
[LUFFY yells]
I'm back!

31
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,153
[BOTH gasp]

32
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,321
Hey, Straw Hat?

33
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,823
If you were aiming to
get their attention,

34
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,257
I think you succeeded.

35
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,325
[LUFFY]
Hm?

36
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,501
Do not let the foremost
group advance any further!

37
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,205
Hold them off and put that
rookie in the ground!

38
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,140
Damn it!

39
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,441
Make 'em pay!

40
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,275
[MARINES yell]

41
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,277
[PIRATES yell]

42
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,213
[MARINE AA groans]

43
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,414
[MARINE B yells]

44
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,248
[MARINE B grunts]

45
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,082
[PIRATE CC groans]

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,650
[ACE whimpers]

47
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,419
Enough beatin'
around the bush!

48
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:48,622
Let's launch a frontal attack
and join Pops inside the bay!

49
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,557
Whatever it takes to save Ace!

50
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,093
Drive them back with
everything you've got!

51
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,928
[RAMBA PIRATES yell]

52
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,199
[PIRATES groan]

53
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,643
We gotta fight the
vice admirals too?

54
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,978
Those guys're too strong!

55
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,013
I don't think we have
any other options.

56
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,749
Well, this is gonna be
rough, but do it for Ace!

57
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,084
[PIRATES yell]

58
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,555
[ACE] They're all going
to get themselves killed!

59
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,990
Bazooka unit ready!

60
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,458
Now fire at Whitebeard!

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,294
Look out!

62
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,702
[MARINES yelp]

63
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,171
[ACE]
Dammit! Please don't do this!

64
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,706
[MARINE E yells]

65
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,045
Now, slash him to pieces!

66
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,585
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Twin Pistol!

67
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,820
[MARINE EE growls]

68
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,522
[LUFFY]
Back off!

69
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,091
You're not gonna stop me
from saving my brother,

70
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,327
so you might as well
get outta my way!

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,266
[ACE]
Luffy! Why do you care so much?

72
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,435
Why do any of them care?

73
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,670
I deserve to die like this!

74
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,306
Why can't they see I'm not worth
risking their lives for?

75
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,347
We, the 2nd division of
the Whitebeard Pirates,

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,183
will save our commander, Ace,
no matter what the cost!

77
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,618
--[PIRATES] Yeah!
--[PIRATES] Right!

78
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,920
[ACE]
Please don't do this.

79
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,288
Just stop.

80
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,358
Just let me die like
I'm supposed to!

81
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,827
[LUFFY]
Ace!

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,229
You're my brother!

83
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,601
You can't be this stupid!

84
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,037
Stop, Luffy! Turn around, Pops!

85
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,624
[GARP]
What is it, Ace?

86
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,495
[ACE]
I'm ready.

87
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,501
[ACE] Ready to accept
whatever I deserve.

88
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,537
[ACE] I'll accept any help
that's offered to me.

89
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:22,409
[ACE] But I'll also
accept any punishment.

90
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,849
Either one.

91
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,284
Whichever comes first.

92
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,436
I'm just ready for
all this to end.

93
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,112
On my signal, men! Fire!

94
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,047
[PIRATES gasp]

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,749
[PIRATES scream]

96
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:07,187
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Balloon!

97
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,656
[MARINES yelp]

98
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,726
[PRISONERS gasping]

99
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,794
Look at that punk,

100
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,629
it's like he's tryin'
to steal the show.

101
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,231
Like this's his war!

102
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,367
It should be
Captain Buggy's!

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,867
I think it's time, boss.

104
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,637
You gotta stand up and show
the world who you are!

105
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,607
This is the perfect moment
for you to defeat Whitebeard!

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,343
Maybe I will! Maybe I will!

107
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,646
[laughs]

108
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,214
[BUGGY]
I gotta keep stalling!

109
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,617
This war is completely bonkers!

110
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,353
It's nothing but monsters
on both sides!

111
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,055
I'll just keep my head
down and stay quiet.

112
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,857
[WHITEBEARD]
Hey, you. Clown nose.

113
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,960
[BUGGY gasps] What the hell
did you just say to me?!

114
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:49,363
Are you cruisin' for
a bruisin', punk?!

115
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,231
Uh...! Huh?

116
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,867
[BUGGY groans]

117
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,337
I take it back!

118
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,472
I thought I recognized you.

119
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,642
You worked for Roger back
when you were a just a brat.

120
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,809
It's been a while,

121
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,278
but it doesn't look like
things've changed too much.

122
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,147
[BUGGY] I can't believe
I just threatened him!

123
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,748
He's gonna kill me!

124
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,250
[MR.3]
Yep, he's a dead man!

125
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,286
His only chance is to run!

126
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:14,054
Holy crap, it's Whitebeard!

127
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,655
And he's speaking to him!

128
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,125
That is like the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

129
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,761
It's just further proof that you
are a genuine living legend!

130
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,564
[BUGGY] Don't they realize
I'm about to die?!

131
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,301
Must be nice if it's not
your ass on the line!

132
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,804
You've got an entire
battalion of prisoners.

133
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,774
Now, you're not planning
on challenging me, are you?

134
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,009
[ALL]
Damn right, he is!

135
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,712
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

136
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,114
You probably wanted
to tell him yourself.

137
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,450
You give him hell,
Captain Buggy!

138
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:46,987
[BUGGY] I don't have much
choice, thanks to you morons!

139
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,489
[BUGGY]
Yeah! We meet at last!

140
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,090
Now prepare yourself!

141
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,792
[PRISONERS cheer]

142
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,095
[MR.3]
Jeez, he is pushing his luck

143
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,497
right off the edge of a cliff!

144
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:58,632
[WHITEBEARD]
Oh, yeah?

145
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,435
It doesn't bother me if
you're hungry for a fight.

146
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,204
But if you beat me,
then what's next?

147
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:08,141
Might be more Navy soldiers than
you can handle on your own.

148
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,309
Aw, hell.

149
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:12,279
If I'm being honest, they're
more than I can handle.

150
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,748
Now, I'm not one to back down
from a challenge,

151
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,785
but it would make more sense
to form an alliance.

152
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,220
Once we're done,
then you can kick my ass.

153
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,288
--[BUGGY] Huh...?
--[PRISONERS cheer]

154
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,823
Oh, holy crap!

155
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,993
Whitebeard actually recognizes
you as his brother in arms!

156
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,662
He considers you an equal!

157
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:31,798
[MR.3] No, he called him a brat
like one minute ago!

158
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,067
Don't tell me you're gonna
try to take on the Navy!

159
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,570
You don't really think
you can win, do you?

160
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:40,541
[BUGGY] Well, yeah.
I've just gotta go all out.

161
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,944
[MR.3] Oh! He's completely
lost his grip on reality!

162
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:44,912
Seriously?!

163
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,914
Oh, I've got goosebumps!

164
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,383
[BUGGY] You know what?
Maybe I can do this!

165
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,285
Maybe I really was
destined to be king,

166
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,787
standing on top of the world!

167
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,990
[BUGGY] Hm... I think you
might be on to something.

168
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,259
Let's join forces and
take down the Navy.

169
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,961
[PRISONERS cheer]

170
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,029
This is amazing!

171
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,530
Man! It's too much!

172
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,266
All right, you win, Whitebeard.

173
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,433
I'll partner with you.

174
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,669
But only 'cause
you're beggin' me to.

175
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,871
[ALL]
Huh?! So arrogant!

176
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,874
Oh, well! That's Captain Buggy!

177
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,208
[MR.3]
What's wrong with them?!

178
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,845
Did he pull some kind of
brainwashing technique

179
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,679
on these idiots?!

180
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:23,650
[MARCO] Hm. Well, that guy is
unbelievably easy to manipulate.

181
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,752
He's a fool, to say the least,

182
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,521
but the prisoners
he's got behind him

183
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,056
are something else entirely.

184
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,358
The last thing we need
now is more enemies.

185
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:34,762
--[PRISONERS cheer]
--[BUGGY laughs]

186
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,464
Now. Back to the war.

187
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,641
All ships in the back, come
forward and deploy backup!

188
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,211
It's time to show 'em
what we're made of!

189

[DECALVAN PIRATES yell]

190
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,151
[MARINE HH panting]
I have a report, sir!

191
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,986
All of the pirates
stationed in the rear

192
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,487
are currently heading this way!

193
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,189
It took them long enough.

194
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,258
Calling the forward
unit at the bay head.

195
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,627
Change the formation as
the Fleet Admiral ordered.

196
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,595
Prepare to deploy strategy.

197
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,663
All units!

198
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,598
Start backing up,
but keep fighting!

199
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:14,334
And make sure
you retreat slowly!

200
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,271
Did they stop firing on us?

201
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,606
Yeah, and it looks like
they're starting to pull back!

202
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,842
Those Navy bastards
are starting to buckle!

203
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,643
One more push and we got 'em!

204
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,046
[PIRATE FF]
Enemy ships on both sides!

205
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,618
It's too late now!

206
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,953
They can't stop us
from charging the bay!

207
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,287
Right.

208
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,923
Now's our chance to finally join
Pops at the center of the fight.

Pudda pudda pudda pudda.

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,829
[WHITEBEARD]
Come in, this is Whitebeard.

212
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,497
Put Squard on the line, now.

213
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,333
Oh, Pops! You need
Captain Squard?

214
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,336
Well, he, um, he was right
here just a few moments ago,

215
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,406
but now, uh, the thing is, I'm
not seeing him anywhere, sir.

216
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,774
[MARCO]
Yeah, go figure.

217
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,009
All that tough talk and
then he's not even around

218
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,677
when you ask for his help.

219
00:12:57,711 --> 00:13:00,013
[WHITEBEARD]
Mm... Well, so it goes.

220
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,383
Get me the DeCalvan
Brothers, then.

221
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,251
Hey, Pops. What's up?

222
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,719
Yeah, Pops. What's up?

223
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,421
I want you to follow my lead.

224
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,090
Take command of all pirate
divisions around you.

225
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,158
[LEFT EYE]
You got it!

226
00:13:11,192 --> 00:13:13,360
[RIGHT EYE] Yes, sir!
And what's the command?

227
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,728
[WHITEBEARD]
Just focus on sinking

228
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,129
the approaching Navy ships.

229
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,632
What?! But, Pops, this is
the best shot we've had

230
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,268
at making a frontal assault
since the battle got started!

231
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:22,769
Yeah, you're not
givin' up, are you?

232
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,538
Just trust me on this one.

233
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,841
I've got a bad feeling
about those ships.

234
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,410
Well, you can count on us, Pops!

235
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:30,911
That's right! We got it!

236
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,014
We'll spread the order
to the other captains!

237
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,782
Really? That's
straight from Pops?

238
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,352
Well, all right then.
I can take the right side.

239
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,755
I got it, we'll take
the left side.

240
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,657
Right. Understood.

241
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,727
We'll join in on the
right side, too.

242
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,396
Okay, if that's what Pops wants.

243
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,131
My ship can take any direction.

244
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,566
Whatever works best.

245
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,301
Squard's missing?

246
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,105
No, I haven't seen him lately.
How unusual.

247
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,106
Sure thing.

248
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,041
We'll take the left flank.

249
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,111
Excuse me, Fleet Admiral, sir,

250
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,312
but the pirates of the New World

251
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,647
have altered their
battle tactics!

252
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,117
Yes. It seems they've
turned to the sides.

253
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,519
[MARINE I] They've suddenly
started attacking

254
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:13,520

[PIRATES yelling]

256
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,536
Your bluff's been called.

257
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,939
Whitebeard must've sensed
something's wrong.

258
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:35,275
[SENGOKU] So I tried a cheap
trick and he didn't fall for it.

259
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,677
I'll admit it was
a bit too obvious.

260
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,012
But still,

261
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:43,083
he can't prevent the inevitable
just because he sees it coming.

262
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,441
Uh! Dammit! There's
too many of them!

263
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,976
I don't see how we'll
ever break through!

opponent this time!

What are you talking about?

[JIMBEI] My karate skills
will be more than adequate

292
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,372
to thwart you. Alone.

Since you know all of
my secrets, Jimbei,

318

did you know that my power
grows exponentially

319

with every shadow I consume?

320
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,076
I'm guessing not,

321
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,779
or you wouldn't have so
foolishly challenged me.

322
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,148
So you got bigger. Pointless.

323
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,884
The power you flaunt is
stolen from others.

strength, but weakness.

Perhaps you should
train yourself more.

349
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,872
It's time you gave up
and let me pass.

350
00:18:58,905 --> 00:18:59,874
I'm done with you.

351
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:01,574
My only concern is Ace.

352
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,244
[MORIA]
You don't get to lecture me!

353
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,312
This fight's not over!

354
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,746
[IVANKOV grunts]

355
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,051
[MARINE LL grunting]

356
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:12,886
[MARINE MM grunting]

--[LUFFY grunts]
--[MARINE LL groans]

358
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:19,526
That's Straw Hat!

359
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,930
[SMOKER]
Huh?

360
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,765
Move, Tashigi!

361
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,633
[LUFFY groans]

362
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:32,472
Jeez!

363
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,507
It's you!

364
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,675
Smokey!

365
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,211
I finally found you.
About time.

366
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,880
[IVANKOV]
Huh? No, Straw boy!

367
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,284
Kuma! Would you just
stop already?

368
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,520
[IVANKOV]
Oh, no, no, no, no!

369
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,688
[IVANKOV screams]

370
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,092
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah.

371
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:54,728
I forgot that his weapon is
tipped with Sea Prism Stone.

372
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,397
That cheater!

373
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,199
Fine. Second gear!

374
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,736
I'm not gonna let you
get away this time.

375
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:08,575
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Jet Gatling!

376
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,244
White Launcher!

377
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,149
You're a lot stronger
than you used to be.

378
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,217
[TASHIGI]
Straw Hat!

379
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,352
[grunts] He vanished! Uh!

380
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,055
[SMOKER]
He's fast! Where is he? Huh?

381
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,592
[LUFFY yells]

382
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,004
Seems I can return
the compliment.

383
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,339
You're a real force
to be reckoned with.

384
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,607
[LUFFY grunts]

385
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,277
[SMOKER grunts]

386
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,212
--[LUFFY groans]

387
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,813
[MARINES gasp]

388
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,048
[LUFFY groaning]

389
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,150
Hate to tell you, though,

390
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:52,319
you're still not strong
enough to beat me.

391
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,022
Whoa, Commodore Smoker
just pinned Straw Hat!

392
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,057
He's amazing!

393
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,258
Dammit! Ya cheap jerk!

394
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,460
Move that thing!

395
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:03,831
After all this time, I finally
understand the truth.

396
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,999
I know why Dragon
really helped you.

397
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:10,070
If it weren't for him that day,
you'd be dead.

398
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,940
You may've had Dragon
to save you in Loguetown,

399
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,941
but no one's gonna
save you today!

400
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,144
[groans] This sucks!

401
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,146
[HANCOCK]
Get your filthy hands off him!

402
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,213
[SMOKER groans]

403
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:24,317
My body's smoke...
how'd she hit me?

404
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,721
You can't just kick him!
He ate a Logia fruit!

405
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,690
[MARINE OO]
Wait a sec!

406
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,793
Why did the pirate empress
just save Straw Hat?

407
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,094
Hey, Hancock!

408
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,596
What the hell's wrong with you?

409
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,464
Don't tell me you're resigning
from the Warlords?

410
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,932
Shut your mouth!

411
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,667
The screaming fury in my heart

412
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,636
has rendered me deaf
to your words!

413
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,605
How dare you pin
my beloved down

414
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,674
with your boorish club
and threaten him?

415
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,644
You will die for your actions.

416
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:54,114
I've never felt this angry
in my entire life!

417
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:58,285
I'll feed you piece by
piece to wild animals!

418
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,621
The Kuja's Haki
is overwhelming.

419
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:02,823
[LUFFY coughs]

420
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,258
Thanks, Hancock!

421
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,127
[HANCOCK giggles]
Of course!

422
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,897
Also, I'm happy you got
my name right again!

423
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,632
[ALL scream]

424
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,701
[IVANKOV]
Please! Listen, that's enough!

425
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,037
Kuma! Look. It's me!

426
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,106
Have you forgotten my face?

427
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,109
If you don't stop, friendship
be damned, I will fight back!

428
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:26,213
[DOFLAMINGO laughs] I don't
know what kind of a history

429
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,782
you two have, but
it doesn't matter.

430
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:30,717
Trust me, Emporio Ivankov.

431
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:33,887
There's really no use in
talking to him as he is now.

432
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,423
Doflamingo. What're you saying?

433
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,024
Is something wrong with him?

434
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,761
[DOFLAMINGO] You're clearly a
friend of Bartholomew Kuma's,

435
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,896
so I doubt you'll
take this well.

436
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,299
The man you knew as
"The Tyrant Kuma"

437
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:48,235
is not the man you see
before you now.

438
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,005
Because that man is dead.

439
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,274
Huh? But that can't be true!

440
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:57,210
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

441
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,083
How can Kuma...

442
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,184
be dead?

443
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,128
[NARRATOR]
Facing Kuma on the battlefield,

444
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,564
Ivankov reveals they
were once friends.

445
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,868
However, Iva's pleas to his
companion fall on deaf ears

446
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,003
as Kuma continues his attacks.

447
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,606
In a sea on confusion
only Doflamingo

448
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:27,674
seems to know the truth.

449
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,476
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

450
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,280
"Kuma's Transformation!
Iva's Blow of Anger!"

451
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:36,349
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
