1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,802
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:45,473
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:50,512
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,415
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,785
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,221
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,658
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:06,628
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,531
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,401
[HILDON] The night
has just begun,

48
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:16,271
but already the shadows
in the forest are deep.

49
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:19,407
Soon, it shall be transformed
into a world of terror,

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,877
far beyond your
worst nightmares.

51
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,479
Might I recommend
you take a ride

52
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:26,281
with me in my carriage?

53
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,550
We could go to
the mansion together.

54
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,285
Mansion?

55
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:31,853
[HILDON] Of course.

56
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:34,689
Dr. Hogback's abode
is just up the way.

57
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:35,924
Huh?!

58
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,325
Huh? What?

59
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:38,927
Do you know him Chopper?

60
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,528
Doctor Hogback?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,602
[LUFFY]
"The Man Called a Genius!

62
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,637
Hogback Makes His Appearance!"

63
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,295
[distant howling]

64
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:40,421
[NAMI] Hey. I didn't
get a good look at them,

65
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,557
so maybe it's
my imagination,

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,993
but don't those horses
seem a bit strange?

67
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:45,860
[HILDON] It's dark.

68
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,795
Your eyes are
playing tricks on you.

69
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,897
[chuckles]

70
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:54,035
[NAMI] Well, if you say so.
I'm sure it's fine.

71
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,970
Anyway, thanks for
saving us back there.

72
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,339
We were in bad shape
before you showed up.

73
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,607
It was nothing.

74
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,743
Have a drink to
calm your nerves.

75
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:07,649
Now, this forest is filled
with frightening creatures.

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,551
It's dangerous to
pass through on foot.

77
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:11,686
I was surprised.

78
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,588
I thought Cerberus
was just a legend,

79
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,690
but there it was, three heads
gnashing and everything!

80
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,525
That thing musta
been some kind of mutant.

81
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:19,360
It just wasn't natural.

82
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:20,662
We were lucky we
got up in that tree,

83
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,363
but I was afraid I'd
never come down again

84
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:23,631
with that thing around!

85
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,066
If you're hoping to
wait for your friends,

86
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,035
the mansion's the safest place.

87
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,537
Besides, they couldn't
possibly miss it.

88
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,538
[CHOPPER]
Not only that.

89
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:33,374
We're gonna get to meet
Dr. Hogback, too, right?

90
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,476
Is this hog guy
really that famous?

91
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,444
Are you kidding?

92
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,546
Every doctor in the
world knows his name!

93
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:40,415
He's one of the
greatest surgeons ever!

94
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:42,050
He can perform
real miracles!

95
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,985
They say his operations
have saved more people

96
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,953
than there are stars in the sky!

97
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,055
He has fame
and fortune,

98
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:50,091
and every other honor a
doctor could ever hope for!

99
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:54,762
The entire medical community
looks up to him as a true hero!

100
00:05:56,464 --> 00:06:00,334
But then, he just
disappeared without a trace.

101
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,136
Some people thought
he had an accident,

102
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,605
and others thought
that he was kidnapped.

103
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,575
But in the end, since
no one could find any clues,

104
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,610
everyone gave up
on looking for him.

105
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,579
And bit by bit they
started thinking of him

106
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:14,515
as nothing more than a legend.

107
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:17,018
That is the Hogback
you're talking about, right?

108
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:19,987
Yes indeed. He's
studying in seclusion.

109
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:21,055
The doctor came to this island

110
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,092
to conduct research beyond
the scope of mankind.

111
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,562
Ah! Do you think I could
get an autograph from him?

112
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,863
[HILDON] I'm sure
he could be persuaded

113
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:31,733
to spare a moment
for one of his fans.

114
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,069
No way.

115
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,006
This island
has lions, too?

116
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:50,418
Aaaaaahhh!!!

117
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,486
What's wrong with you?

118
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,889
Don't scare me like that!
Come on! What happened?

119
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,557
[NAMI] There was a lion!

120
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:59,427
But he--his face was...

121
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:02,063
[NAMI]
Ugh. It looked like this.

122
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,831
Oh yeah, right!

123
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:04,899
Wanna see?

124
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:08,436
Then take a look
for yourself! Here!

125
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:13,775
[laughter]

126
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,011
Huh?!

127
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:17,845
Eh?!

128
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:26,120
Oh?!

129
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,822
[sighs]

130
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,958
[laughter]

131
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,863
Aaaaah!

132
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:37,532
[ALL THREE] That is not right!

133
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,501
That is definitely not right!

134
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,204
Please, stop the carriage!

135
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,006
We need to turn around, Hildon.

136
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,909
My goodness, whatever
could've upset you so much?

137
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,477
Perhaps you all saw an illusion?

138
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,411
What do you mean "illusion"?

139
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:52,213
There was something
out there for sure!

140
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,482
This forest is freakin' strange!

141
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,018
That much is true.
It is a bit odd here.

142
00:07:57,051 --> 00:08:00,121
The fog, for example,
has strange qualities.

143
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,824
It can even cause
hallucinations for some.

144
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,926
So you mean
it was just the fog?

145
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,061
[sighs] That's good!

146
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,964
Illusion? The fog?

147
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:12,633
No, that doesn't make any sense.

148
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,102
Listen Hildon, I'm sorry,

149
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:17,905
but I really do need you to take
us back to the coast right away.

150
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,739
Even if it's dangerous,

151
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,908
the three of us
can manage somehow.

152
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,745
But I wanna meet Dr. Hogback!

153
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,816
It's not fair! I have to!

154
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,618
[USOPP] I know how you feel,
but my "Something Freaky

155
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,720
is Going on Here"
Sensor is on high alert.

156
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,589
You've gotta trust
my powers on this one.

157
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,891
Either you can
go see the doctor and die,

158
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,259
or we can turn
back now and live.

159
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,061
Which one will it be?

160
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,263
Well, of course
I don't wanna die!

161
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:43,698
That's scary!

162
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,600
Oh, that's too bad.

163
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,034
Then, as you wish,

164
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,037
I'll have the driver turn
the carriage around for you.

165
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,939
Wait a moment
and I shall return.

166
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:54,575
[HILDON] Stop the carriage!

167
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:03,000
[chuckles]

168
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,948
Listen Chopper,
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,583
I know what this means to you.

170
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,951
No, I understand.

171
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,786
If I was strong
and brave like Luffy,

172
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,688
I could just walk
there by myself instead

173
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,623
of sitting here and crying.

174
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,799
How long does he plan
to make us wait here?

175
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,569
Dunno, but I'm too scared
to look outside again.

176
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,972
He's just turning around.

177
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,107
It should only take a sec.

178
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,478
Gaaaah!!

179
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,846
There's nobody here!

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,649
Not even the horses!

181
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,850
Not only that, they left us

182
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,986
in the middle of
some scary graveyard!

183
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,589
Are you kidding me? But why?

184
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,557
What? No, That can't be right!

185
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,026
Please, someone tell me
he just left to go pee!

186
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,631
Hildon! Hey! Where'd you go?

187
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,190
[USOPP] Leaving us alone at
night is one thing, but come on!

188
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,925
In a graveyard?

189
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,594
[NAMI] Yeah, I get it!
Just-- just stop, okay?

190
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,730
I'm trying to think here.

191
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,165
What should we do?
I'm scared!

192
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,834
[NAMI] Chopper.

193
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,936
[NAMI] What is it now?

194
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,874
[USOPP] Is that? No.

195
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,014
Aaaauuuggghhh!!

196
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,593
This is a dream, right?

197
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:18,044
[ALL THREE] Z-Z-Zombies! Nooooo!

198
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,665
[USOPP] It hurts! Help me!

199
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,866
Usopp!

200
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,602
These things are strong!

201
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,772
Usopp, no!

202
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,149
[CHOPPER] They're gonna
flip over the carriage!

203
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,185
He was right--
they're crazy strong!

204
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,030
[USOPP]
Aaaaaaugh!!

205
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,898
It bit me! Damn it!

206
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,268
It's all over! I'm gonna
turn into a zombie now!

207
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:20,072
Usopp! Hold on, I'm coming!

208
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,682
No! Get away
from me! Stop it!

209
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,319
Somebody help me! Ah!

210
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,625
Let Usopp go!

211
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,363
Eat this!

212
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,605
I'm sorry!

213
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,340
[ZOMBIE 340F] Here,
you dropped this.

214
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,308
[ZOMBIE 340D] Oh, thanks.

215
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,714
Don't let them bite me! Hurry!

216
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,648
Nami!

217
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,084
I said get off me! Get away!

218
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,786
My Exploding Star should work!

219
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,954
Zombies hate fire!

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,158
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340A]
Dude! Fire!

221
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,059
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340B]
Get back man, that'll burn you!

222
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,062
I figured it would work,
but I wasn't expecting this.

223
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,064
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340C]
That's dangerous, you idiot!

224
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,666
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340D] Didn't
your parents raise you right?

225
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,301
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340E]
You little turd!

226
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,136
All right, that got the
zombies out of our way.

227
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,371
C'mon, Nami!

228
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,806
[USOPP] Let's get outta here!

229
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,940
Right!

230
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,877
[USOPP] At this point,
we might as well make

231
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,679
a run for the mansion, since
it's closer than the shore.

232
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,214
[CHOPPER] That sounds
like a good idea to me!

233
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,249
[NAMI] That was so scary!

234
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,984
Don't worry, we're fine.

235
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,319
As long as we're able
to keep up the pace,

236
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,788
there's no way those
things can catch us!

237
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
Even if they're strong
and don't get tired,

238
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,859
they shamble along
really slow when they move.

239
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,761
Shamble slow.

240
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,965
Shamble slow. Shamble slow.

241
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,099
Turbo shamble!

242
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,068
[USOPP] What,
were they just lazy?

243
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,777
[USOPP] No! No--

244
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,148
Hey, wait a sec.

245
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,319
They're tired now?

246
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,887
[CHOPPER] Keep running, Usopp!

247
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,055
[USOPP] Uh, right!

248
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,746
[ZORO] We're drifting away!
Do something, stupid!

249
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,448
[SANJI] You got
any ideas, genius?

250
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,316
The steering wheel
won't move an inch!

251
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,885
[FRANKY] Even if
we used the paddle,

252
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,453
those waves are too high.

253
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,256
Eh, no big hurry--
I'm still having fun.

254
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,758
The waves'll take us to the
island sooner or later.

255
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,793
Yeah? And what
about Nami, huh?

256
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,262
You forget about her?

257
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,396
What is that?

258
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,998
Hmm?

259
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,202
Is that a spider web?

260
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,110
[ROBIN] At this rate
we're going to be trapped.

261
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,445
[FRANKY] Hurry!
Use the paddle! Quick!

262
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,814
It's too late.
We're already caught.

263
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,992
Damn it. Now what?

264
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,494
The ship didn't take any damage,

265
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,496
but it's not like
we can sail it anymore.

266
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,563
And by the way,

267
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,565
I'd hate to see the
spider that spun this thing.

268
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,134
It's frikkin' huge!

269
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,837
[howl]

270
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,309
They aren't
following us, right?

271
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,844
[USOPP] Man, what
is with this island?

272
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,347
Half the stuff here isn't
even supposed to be real!

273
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,416
And by the way, if I start
turning into a zombie

274
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,218
and go after your brains,
then just kill me!

275
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,320
Where'd that come from?

276
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,487
If you get bit by a zombie,

277
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,956
you turn into one
and eat brains--

278
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,524
I read it in a book,
so it must be true.

279
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,526
I don't think you're mature
enough for horror novels,

280
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,428
you should stick
to children's books.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,000
[sighs] Well, here we are.

282
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,402
I sure could go
for a glass of water.

283
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,605
I can see him after
all! Lucky me!

284
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,574
If he's crazy
enough to live here,

285
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,009
I have a feeling he's not going

286
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,396
to be quite as welcoming
as you hope, but fine.

287
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:28,829
[NAMI] Excuse me?

288
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,466
Is this the mansion of
Dr. Hogback, by any chance?

289
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,237
We're traveling pira--
Uh, traveling traveler people.

290
00:16:37,271 --> 00:16:38,505
We've lost our way,

291
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,642
so could we take shelter
here until morning?

292
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,212
Hello? Is anyone there?

293
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,549
[USOPP] Well, there's nothing
stopping us from going in,

294
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:50,718
though this tunnel
is kinda scary lookin'.

295
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,753
[CHOPPER] I can see the
courtyard on the other side.

296
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,788
[NAMI] Is the doctor home?

297
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,194
What if no one
lives here?

298
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,395
Beats the zombies!

299
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,530
I say we give it a look.

300
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,233
[CHOPPER]
The lights just turned on!

301
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,268
That's a good sign, right?

302
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,572
[USOPP] But why would they shine
a spotlight on this old well?

303
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:12,873
It's weird.

304
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,481
Oh no. What is it now?

305
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,786
Welcome.

306
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:31,558
[CINDRY] One. Two. Three.

307
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:34,461
[CINDRY] And four, five.

308
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,830
Ah, ow! This crazy
woman is throwing plates!

309
00:17:36,864 --> 00:17:38,265
[CINDRY] Six. Seven.

310
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,768
Why are you only attacking me?

311
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,969
Why, you ask?

312
00:17:42,002 --> 00:17:45,539
Because you alone are not
allowed to enter the mansion.

313
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:48,208
You two are just fine, though.

314
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:50,310
Uh. I'm confused.

315
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:53,180
[CINDRY] Now you,
get out! Eight! Nine!

316
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,515
[USOPP] I don't get it!

317
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,519
[MALE VOICE] Stop it.
That's enough!

318
00:17:58,552 --> 00:17:59,086
What?

319
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,555
Please! Nothing scary!

320
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,562
Ehhh... Hope he
doesn't throw plates.

321
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:09,663
[MALE VOICE]
We can make an exception

322
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:12,299
just this once,
can't we, Cindry?

323
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,468
Forgive me if we startled you.

324
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:15,536
You must excuse her.

325
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,905
You see, she was once
engaged to a wealthy man,

326
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:20,240
but to test his love,
she shattered ten plates

327
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:21,742
from his cherished dining set.

328
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,278
Sadly, he then called
off the engagement.

329
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,813
Cast out of her
home in disgrace,

330
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,481
she has become
my personal servant

331
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,349
with a boundless plate grudge.

332
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,585
Yeaaah... I don't really care.

333
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:33,687
[MALE VOICE] And as you
may have already surmised,

334
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,291
I am the long-missing, world-
famous surgeon, Dr. Hogback.

335
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,426
A genius, in the eyes of many.

336
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,761
[CINDRY] Ten!

337
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,528
[NAMI] Usopp!

338
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,397
Hey, Cindry!
We went over this!

339
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,332
I said he could come inside!

340
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,567
When you don't listen to me,

341
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,503
then I look like a fool
in front of our guests!

342
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:52,339
Uh-oh.

343
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,616
[CINDRY] I wish every last plate
in this world would disappear.

344
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:04,885
I got it! You don't
have to tell me!

345
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,521
I mean, I just got done
explaining it, didn't I?

346
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:09,857
So Chopper, that's who
you were talking about?

347
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,926
D-Doctor Hogback!
It's really him!

348
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,628
Doesn't look like
a genius to me.

349
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:16,463
Shut up, Nami!

350
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,869
[CINDRY] I'll make
an exception this once.

351
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:23,270
All three of you may enter.

352
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,639
We'll continue our
conversation inside.

353
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:26,507
Follow me.

354
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,708
[HOGBACK]
Uh, and there you have it,

355
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:29,276
please make yourselves at home.

356
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,677
I still don't get
why she hated me

357
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:31,979
so much,
but whatever.

358
00:19:32,012 --> 00:19:33,780
I guess, at least,
we get to go in now.

359
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,817
Right. Anything's better
than that creepy forest.

360
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:46,293
Oh! Ah. Hey, wait!
I'm still here...

361
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:51,465
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!!

362
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:53,667
It's quite rare for
me to receive guests,

363
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,336
but my, you
certainly are filthy.

364
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,971
Was it a stressful trip?

365
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:01,041
[NAMI] Well, yes, but it's
sort of a long story. We, uh--

366
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,009
[CHOPPER] Go ahead, Nami.

367
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,977
I can talk to him about
doctor stuff later.

368
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:06,647
We were attacked by a bunch
of zombies in the forest,

369
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,583
so we ran away and
came here to take shelter.

370
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,351
Zombies, huh?

371
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,654
We also saw a bunch
of crazy monsters

372
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:14,955
that were straight
out of a horror story!

373
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,990
What the heck is up
with this creepy island?

374
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,525
I mean, you live here, right?

375
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,493
You gotta know something!

376
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,828
So these beasts were
chasing you, were they?

377
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:26,066
And yet you still made it here
in one piece. Quite impressive.

378
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,501
But to answer your question,

379
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:29,937
I don't know much about
those creatures either,

380
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,939
which is precisely why I'm here.

381
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,074
Oh! You mean you're
studying zombies?

382
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,076
It's a brand new realm
of medical research!

383
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,644
Yes, indeed!

384
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:40,514
Although most people
associate zombies with fear,

385
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:41,848
what if you think
of them in terms

386
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:44,518
of "someone who has
come back from the dead?"

387
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:47,721
Then it's a miracle!
The dream of all doctors!

388
00:20:47,754 --> 00:20:49,756
Everyone in this
world has a loved one

389
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,892
they'd like to see
come back to life!

390
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,660
Why, that's human nature!

391
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:56,096
And yet the medical
community condemns it.

392
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,664
Madness, they call it!

393
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,566
I'm trying to
play God, they say!

394
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,401
That's why I disappeared
from society,

395
00:21:01,435 --> 00:21:03,537
so I could continue
my research in seclusion

396
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,739
on this island
without interruption!

397
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:08,442
Oh, wow! So I finally
found out the truth!

398
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,011
But just think-- If your
research here is a success

399
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,412
then you're going
to bring happiness

400
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:14,548
to thousands of people
all over the world!

401
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:18,085
As a doctor, myself, sir,
I'm behind you all the way!

402
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,620
How open minded!

403
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,922
Why, thank you, Doctor Chopper.

404
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:25,892
[CHOPPER] Even if you
acknowledge me as a doctor,

405
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:28,428
you won't get on my
good side, you big dummy!

406
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,699
[CHOPPER] C-Could I
have your autograph?

407
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:37,738
Oh, of course!
"To my dear, Doctor Chopper."

408
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:39,439
So do you think
you could give me

409
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:41,108
a little tour of your lab later?

410
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:45,846
No one, and I mean no one,
can look inside my lab!

411
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,450
[splat]

412
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,451
Ahhh!

413
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:52,786
Come on here, Cindry!

414
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,821
Can't you at least put
the flan on a plate?

415
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,057
Is that too much to ask?

416
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,061
I wish every last plate in
this world would disappear.

417
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:02,729
Fasfasfasfasfas!

418
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:04,898
Well, this sort of
thing does tend to happen,

419
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,833
so rest assured,
I'm always quite adamant

420
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,568
about keeping the
table cloth clean.

421
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,537
Okay. I'll eat, then.

422
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,073
You could still use
a spoon, you idiots!

423
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,776
[CHOPPER] It's so sweet--
I love it!

424
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,611
[CINDRY] I've prepared
a bath for you.

425
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,812
Since you're all filthy,

426
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:21,448
you should take one
before you go to bed.

427
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,582
I almost forgot to ask you.

428
00:22:22,616 --> 00:22:25,218
There's someone else who
came to this island before us.

429
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,319
This may sound crazy,

430
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:29,456
but have you seen a
skeleton roaming around today?

431
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:32,592
A skeleton?

432
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:33,660
[USOPP] Yeah, he had an afro

433
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,962
and he was in a really
good mood for a dead guy.

434
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:39,132
[clack, clack, clack]

435
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,537
Yohohoho!!

436
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,005
'Course, even for this place,

437
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:46,039
I know it'd still be weird

438
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,675
to see a skeleton walking
around and talking.

439
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:50,777
So you're sure
he didn't come by?

440
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:02,222
[HOGBACK] Never seen him.

441
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,592
All right then.
It's no big deal.

442
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,697
[thinking] Is it really him?
No. It couldn't be.

443
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:21,108
[USOPP] Nami, are you
done in the bath, yet?

444
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:22,642
I'm getting bored out here.

445
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:24,144
[NAMI] No! And stop peeping!

446
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:26,246
Anyway, we're leaving
this place at sunset.

447
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,749
[USOPP] At night?
But what about the zombies?

448
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,650
[NAMI] What, you think
we're safe in the mansion?

449
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:31,852
Also, what's that noise?

450
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:33,019
Are you keeping watch?

451
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:34,654
[USOPP] Um. Uh-oh.

452
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,056
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

453
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:37,991
"Nami's in a Major Pinch!

454
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:40,727
The Zombie Mansion
and the Invisible Man!"

455
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,929
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
