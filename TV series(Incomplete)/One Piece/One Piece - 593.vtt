00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.463
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:39.868
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.871
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:48.042
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.545
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.965
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.800
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.178
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.055
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.518
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.145
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.732
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:15.195
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.825
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.369
the Straw Hat Pirates
depart for the deadly waters

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:27.874
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.542
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.712
an island divided into
burning and frozen halves.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.089
There, they learn of
terrifying experiments

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.426
performed by the master of
the island, Caesar Clown.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:41.346
Luffy goes to confront him,
but while his crew is divided,

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.015
they're targeted
by a strange enemy.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.642
What are those things?

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:48.102
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] They look
like big footprints to me.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:49.562
[USOPP]
Did an animal make them?

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.899
It couldn't have been a human,
unless they're a giant.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.276
I can sense something,
and they're close.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.445
Beast lookin' guys. Big ones!

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.072
[gasps] What're we gonna do?

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:00.406
Someone's out here.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:02.867
Law? The Master?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.952
No.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:07.330
We're in the snowy mountains,
so it's gotta be them.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.624
They prowl the snowy peaks,

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.669
appearing whenever
a blizzard strikes!

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.005
[SCOTCH]
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:20.885
Just so you know, you happen
to be on our hit list, too.

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:24.055
I'm warnin' you, jerks!

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.141
You better not have
hurt any of my crew!

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.608
[LUFFY yelling]

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.945
What the--? Where'd he go?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.446
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
They captured Nami!

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.324
Those big jerks
took her with them!

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.245
[LUFFY]
"Save Nami!

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.540
Luffy's Fight on the
Snow-Capped Mountains!"

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.919
[USOPP]
Nami's been kidnapped?

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.087
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
It was my fault.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.215
They were huge,
but I never saw them coming!

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:02.927
They showed up outta nowhere,
attacked, then they left.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.930
[USOPP] First it was centaurs,
now we've got giants, too?

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.558
What kind of messed up
island is this?

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.269
An ambush. So they
were tracking us.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.770
That means they're
professionals.

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:13.730
They must be.

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.606
Huh? I'm confused.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:18.443
So they didn't come
to save Gatorbeard?

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:19.694
Definitely not.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:23.740
Seems they wanted to kill us
and take the children back.

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.325
But then their Master--

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:28.077
He made them kill Brownbeard!

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.246
They were on the same side!

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:33.374
Brownbeard was so loyal, too.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.752
[BROWNBEARD] The Master
wouldn't harm children,

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:37.628
he's a warm-hearted savior.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.630
[CHOPPER (SANJI)] We don't know
much about this Master guy,

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.924
but there are two
things I'm sure of.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.260
That he's evil
and he's dangerous.

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.553
He can't take them.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.305
Who knows what he'll do?

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:48.931
And that's not the only problem!

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.100
Nami's still trapped
in Franky's body.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:54.312
I'm really worried
about her, guys!

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.106
Yeah. I'll save her somehow.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.275
All right. You look
after the kids!

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.902
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
Luffy, wait!

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.905
Don't forget.
It's my body they took.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:04.947
Hey, Chopper!

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.657
I can't fight in this rat suit!

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.702
Gimme one of those magic beans
that turns you into a badass!

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.162
And make it quick, would ya?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.206
What bean?
Wait, the Rumble Ball?

00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.457
But that's a drug!

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.543
You can't control it!
Not on the first try!

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:18.753
'Course I can!

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.798
I'm a superpowered cyborg
with the heart of a champion.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.466
Now hand over the goods, dammit.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.427
We don't have a lot of time to
sit here and argue about it!

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.763
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
Ugh, fine.

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.139
Huh?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.686
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
But just one, okay?

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.355
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] Oh, come on!
They were in that pocket

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.981
the whole time?

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.734
Well yeah. It's his stuff.
Where else would it be?

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.404
Listen. That thing
will make you a monster,

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.655
but not for long.

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:48.116
After just three minutes,
you'll be worn out.

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.743
Try to do Kung-Fu Point
like I did earlier, and--

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.829
Ahh.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.956
[USOPP screams]

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.417
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]
Super!

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.419
Way too early!

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.757
[LUFFY]
Come on, Franky! Follow me!

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:05.800
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.511
Huh? [gasps]

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:14.475
[roaring]

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.270
[LUFFY]
Whoa, stop it.

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:19.188
Why are you tryin' to squish me?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.483
--[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roaring]
--[LUFFY screams]

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:28.489
Franky! I told you! Be careful!

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.368
Maybe we shoulda
had him stay here?

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.911
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
He's dangerous right now,

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.830
but once the Rumble
Ball wears off,

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.331
he'll be too weak to move.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.750
[ROBIN]
Then he'll be useless.

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:48.676
[CAESAR CLOWN] Hmm.
I don't know where he got it,

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.470
but this "Cyborg" Franky fellow

00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:55.141
appears to have Vegapunk's laser
weapon attached to his body.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.726
Don't you worry, Vegapunk.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:08:00.771
I promise. I'll make
good use of it.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:03.024
After I cut that
garish robot to pieces

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:04.484
and extract the laser system,

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:08.070
his body will be nothing but a
worthless pile of scrap metal.

00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:09.989
Prepare the incinerator!

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.240
[SUBORDINATE A]
Yes, sir.

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:14.243
Those would-be ship thieves, you
know, the ones from the Navy.

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.203
What of them?

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:16.913
[SUBORDINATE A]
O-Oh, right.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:20.958
Well, we were able to
stage an ambush, sir, but...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.418
Huh?

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.506
[gunshots]

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:29.133
[CENTAUR A laughs]

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.676
These guys aren't human!

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.803
Are they horses, or?

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.723
Bring them down, now! [grunts]

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.392
Nope. You're not gonna
beat us that easily, punks!

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.144
[FEN BOCK]
Watch your back!

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.940
[MARINES gasp, groan]

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.491
[CENTAUR G]
We've got you now!

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.909
[MARINE I]
How many do they have?

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.160
What do we do?

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.620
[MARINE K]
We're stuck!

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.873
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
We need a new tactic!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:04.043
Let's focus on taking
the ship full-force!

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.841
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) yells]

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.802
[TASHIGI (SMOKER) yells]

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.351
It's the Cap--
er, I mean Smokey!

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:23.563
[SUBORDINATE A] The battle's
raging out of control now!

00:09:23.604 --> 00:09:27.900
Oh? Then we're having trouble?

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:30.236
[SUBORDINATE A gasps]
I-I mean...!

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:35.199
Ah. In that case...

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.244
[cackles]

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.582
[SUBORDINATE A]
M-Master?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.962
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Ah yes. This will do nicely.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:51.215
I'm sure the Navy will make
excellent test subjects!

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:56.887
[laughs] It's a
golden opportunity!

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.851
Contact all the Centaurs
currently on patrol.

00:10:01.892 --> 00:10:03.185
Better make it quick.

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:04.312
[SUBORDINATE B]
Right!

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.981
[CAESAR CLOWN] Tell our soldiers
to evacuate at once.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.983
Unless they want
to die, that is.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:09.817
[SUBORDINATE B gasps]

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:15.531
[cackles]

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.374
[NAMI (FRANKY) grunts]
What do you want from me?

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.460
Perverts! Let me go!

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.046
Keep your filthy paws
to yourself, you hear me?

00:10:30.087 --> 00:10:33.424
Listen, I understand that
I'm cute, and voluptuous,

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.551
and you wanted me
all to yourselves--

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.887
This guy is different.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.015
[SCOTCH] Hey, whatever
he's into, it's cool with me.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:43.059
You'll pay for this, jerks!

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.311
Just wait until Luffy gets here!

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.147
He'll kick your hairy
butts into next week!

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.149
[gasps]

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.276
[ROCK]
Hey. Keep your voice down.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.153
Noisy prisoners are...

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:55.446
[SCOTCH]
Not cool.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.280
[NAMI (FRANKY) gasps]

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:57.448
[ROCK]
On the other hand,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.117
the laser weapon
built into your body is...

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.661
[SCOTCH]
Very cool.

00:11:01.702 --> 00:11:03.579
[ROCK]
And, the reward for bringing it

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.790
to our Master will be...

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.002
[BOTH]
Extra cool!

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.552
This wind is so cool!

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:22.264
[SCOTCH sighs]
Almost too cool.

00:11:25.601 --> 00:11:27.687
Get some clothes!

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:28.938
[gasps]

00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:31.315
[ROCK] To someone your size,
a shot from one of our rifles

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.567
is like being hit
by a cannonball.

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:36.153
[SCOTCH] And these are
filled with poison gas.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.989
Our targets never
see it coming, either.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.908
As for your friend...

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.493
Of course he'll come.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.870
We set a trap to lure him here.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.205
[ROCK]
He won't be able to resist

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:49.250
following giant
footprints in the snow.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.212
[LUFFY screams]

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.090
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.592
[LUFFY] Sweet,
giant footprints in the snow!

00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:01.512
Obviously I should follow them.
This is way too easy!

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.056
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:08.853
[LUFFY] Hey quit it, Franky, how
many times do I gotta tell you?

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.104
Huh?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.571
Huh, there's no more
footprints. [gasps]

00:12:18.612 --> 00:12:24.326
[LUFFY screaming]

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.162
Luffy and Chopper?

00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.705
No wait! That's Franky!

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.749
Nami!

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.043
Be careful! They're both hiding!

00:12:33.085 --> 00:12:35.045
[LUFFY screams]

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.633
[ROCK]
Ready, Scotch?

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:43.387
[SCOTCH] Ready. Pretty uncool
of him not to notice the cliff.

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:47.308
[LUFFY gasps]
Are those spikes?

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:49.602
Heh, heh. It's all over.

00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:52.104
[SCOTCH]
Not a cool way to die.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.859
[giggles] Armament. Hardening!

00:12:56.901 --> 00:13:02.448
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:08.913
[LUFFY grunting]

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:19.131
[SCOTCH] Ah. He's a bit
trickier than the rest.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.387
You won't run this time.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.683
Now. Second Gear!

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:36.732
Gum-Gum... Jet... Pistol!

00:13:38.692 --> 00:13:40.444
[gasps]

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.822
[LUFFY]
You want more?

00:13:42.863 --> 00:13:44.740
Jet Stamp!

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.244
[LUFFY gasps]
They're gone!

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.376
[ROCK chuckles]
Nice try,

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.336
but these mountains
are our home.

00:13:57.378 --> 00:14:01.507
[SCOTCH] Which means we know
all the cool hiding places!

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.431
[CENTAUR C] The place
the Master was talking about

00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:12.059
should be around here.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.394
Huh?

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:18.399
[CENTAUR C] What's this
big building s'posed to be?

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.984
[CENTAUR D]
Is it a warehouse?

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:22.403
[CENTAUR E]
Kinda gives me the creeps.

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:23.696
I'll open the door.

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:26.574
Here. Hold that.

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:32.621
[CENTAUR C grunting]

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:41.171
[CENTAUR C pants]
Hey, help me out!

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.423
[CENTAUR D]
Sure.

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:49.513
[CENTAUR C, CENTAUR D grunting]

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:01.817
[sloshing]

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.986
[BOTH gasp]
Huh?

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:05.821
[CENTAUR C]
Hey. I just heard something

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:07.573
moving around in there.

00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:08.908
Nah, can't be.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.743
Look. I don't like this.

00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:12.912
We were told not to
come near here, right?

00:15:12.953 --> 00:15:15.664
So don't open the door.
Let's just go.

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.708
But the Master told us
about this place

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.835
and he said he
wants us to open it.

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:22.421
What? You do trust
the Master, dontcha?

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.965
Oh no! That's not
what I mean at all!

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.426
Then lend me a hand! Hurry!

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:39.188
[sloshing]

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:02.920
[gunshots]

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.943
They may be big,
but they're quick!

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.027
Oh, I know!

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:28.529
Gum-Gum...

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.698
[ROCK]
Stop right there!

00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:33.325
[LUFFY]
...Balloon!

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:38.205
[LUFFY]
Rayleigh told me it's a waste

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.749
to just use this
move for defense.

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.085
Let's see. What'd he say?

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.505
Take the bullets and send
'em all right back to him

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.757
twice as hard!

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.511
Now, Gum-Gum... Fire Salute!

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:53.762
[ROCK gasps]

00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:58.434
[SCOTCH]
Rock!

00:16:58.475 --> 00:17:00.185
Gotcha!

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:02.312
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.064
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:09.236
[LUFFY gasping]
What did I do to you?

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:10.362
Lay off, Franky!

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.197
We've got bigger problems here!

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:15.451
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roaring]

00:17:15.492 --> 00:17:18.579
[ROCK groans]
Now I'm burning up!

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.416
They might lose their cool,
but I won't lose mine!

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:24.418
[LUFFY gasps]

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.003
Franky!

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.588
[SCOTCH]
The cool thing about mountains

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.632
is they can be
turned into weapons!

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:38.015
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:42.853
Watch out! The top of that
mountain's falling on you!

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.147
Luffy! Franky! Heads up!

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:47.066
[roars]

00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:49.568
[ROCK]
You'll never get away in time!

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.155
[NAMI (FRANKY)] Look behind you!
He's gonna shoot!

00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:55.699
[ROCK] All it takes is
one of these KYP cannisters

00:17:55.741 --> 00:18:00.120
and you'll fall into a drunken
stupor, just like the others!

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.499
[ROCK]
Hm?

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:06.710
[ROCK groans]

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.547
Franky did something useful!

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:17.930
[LUFFY laughs]

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.811
Yeah! Now you're gettin' it!

00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:25.229
Good job!

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.480
[FRANKY (CHOPPER) roars]

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.398
Huh? [gasps]

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.193
Oh great.
We're back to this, huh?

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:35.364
Third Gear!

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:40.202
Gum-Gum... Elephant Gun!

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:47.376
You went straight to
that trick of the day?

00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:52.172
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
No! Help!

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:56.510
[LUFFY]
Uh-oh! Sorry, Chopper's body!

00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:58.554
I'll get Chopper to
fix you up later!

00:18:58.595 --> 00:19:01.348
Wait, gah, nevermind!

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.684
[SCOTCH]
I told you before,

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:06.395
we have the home-field
advantage in these mountains.

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:07.729
Just give up!

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:10.107
Luffy!

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.050
[LUFFY]
Nami!

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:38.177
[SCOTCH]
Forget it!

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:41.096
I can reach a lot
higher than you can!

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.351
Whoa! He's not kidding.

00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:47.936
But...

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:59.823
[LUFFY gasps, screams]

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.743
[LUFFY groans] If I lose
'em in these mountains,

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:05.204
I'll never track 'em down again!

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.377
[SCOTCH]
Huh?

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.379
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Hm? It's Law!

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:18.467
[SCOTCH] Ah, Trafalgar Law,
the famous freeloader.

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:20.219
Cool, I'm glad you're here.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.305
Straw Hat Luffy
should be right behind me.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.973
Room.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.226
[SCOTCH]
Huh?

00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:50.749
[NAMI (FRANKY) screams]

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.517
[SCOTCH] Damn you!
That wasn't cool at all!

00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:11.228
[SCOTCH gasps]

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.615
All right, Counter Shock.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:29.663
[SCOTCH groaning]

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:49.725
Thank you!

00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:53.603
[gasps] Wait.
Change me back, creep!

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.688
[LUFFY]
Nami!

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.815
Hey!

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:59.776
Huh? Oh! It's you!

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.820
Thanks for saving Nami, buddy!

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:04.489
Look, here's the
thing, Straw Hat.

00:22:05.782 --> 00:22:06.867
[LAW]
I came here because

00:22:06.908 --> 00:22:09.661
there's something I want
to discuss with you.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:16.543
[LAW] I assume you landed on
Punk Hazard by accident.

00:22:16.585 --> 00:22:19.671
But there's an important key
hiding on this island--

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:20.797
one that's powerful enough

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:24.343
to throw the New World
into total chaos.

00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.971
[LAW]
You see, there are only two ways

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.223
to live in the New World.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:34.269
[LAW] Fighting under the
unbrella of the Four Emperors,

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.605
or fighting against them.

00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:40.359
[LAW] And you don't
strike me as the type

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.945
who likes to work
under someone else.

00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:45.739
Yup. That's right.

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.199
I'm captain!

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.117
[LAW]
I see.

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:52.496
Well then, you can work with me.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:53.705
Huh?

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:55.457
Like how?

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:59.878
Us two will take down
one of the Four Emperors.

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.427
I've got a good plan.

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:10.305
So, tell me, are you in?

00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:19.648
[NARRATOR] Law proposes
taking down an Emperor.

00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:22.734
While his proposal leaves
Nami and the others stunned,

00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:25.153
it's Luffy's answer
which shocks everyone,

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.364
including Law himself.

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:30.534
Meanwhile, the diabolical
scientist Caesar

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:33.954
begins launching his
utterly vile plan.

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:35.956
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:39.167
"Formed! Luffy and Law's
Pirate Alliance!"

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:42.003
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
