1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,074
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,535
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,206
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:50,253
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,132
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,510
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,762
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,391
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,352
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,606
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,151
[BROOK] The name of that
friend that we left at a cape,

48
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,361
swearing to meet again, is...

49
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,030
...Laboon.

50
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,659
Laboon.

51
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,748
This is crazy,
what're the chances?

52
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,083
I'll be damned.

53
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,628
[CHOPPER] Hm?

54
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,673
We've met that whale before.

55
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,134
And we know that promise.

56
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:44,307
[roars]

57
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,144
And to think, we met
one of Laboon's friends

58
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,147
by complete coincidence.

59
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:59,489
[ZORO] Wonder what that
skeleton's doing right now.

60
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,497
[FRANKY sobs]

61
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,750
I love that bonehead
and his stupid whale!

62
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,377
Shut up!

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm totally pumped, guys!
He's a musician,

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,512
a talking skeleton, has an
afro, does that "yoho" thing,

65
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,890
and he was one of
Laboon's best friends!

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,644
Even if I've gotta force him to,
he is gonna join our crew.

67
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,856
We got us a musician.
Any objections? Speak up.

68
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,193
Would it really change
your mind even if we did?

69
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,653
I want him to join the crew too!

70
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,613
No question! Him and Laboon!

71
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,824
Complete and total approval!

72
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,909
Same here, you big dumb bastard!

73
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,370
And I'm not scared
of skeletons, dammit!

74
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,331
Before I can answer
such an easy question.

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:54,460
I've gotta put a stop to this
shotgun wedding of Nami's!

76
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,632
[LUFFY] Hey, Zoro!
Where ya goin'?

77
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,842
I'm going off to get started.

78
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,512
Ya keep adding shadows. We got
a lot we need to get back.

79
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,225
[LUFFY] Alright, crew!
Time to get serious!

80
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,352
Prepare for the counterattack!

81
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,731
We're gonna put Thriller Bark
in a watery grave!

82
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,774
[CREW] Yeah!

83
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,655
[LUFFY] "Food, Nami and Shadows!

84
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,158
Luffy's Enraged Counterattack."

85
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,920
A pole? What's on top?

86
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,175
I'muna find out.
This'll be fun.

87
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,427
Alright.

88
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,942
Huh? What's up?

89
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:06,240
I'da sworn my arms would
stretch. Why'd I think that?

90
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,952
Maybe I'm thinkin' of my legs.

91
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,126
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 355A]
Wh-What the hell?

92
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,836
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 355B]
Is it the giant?

93
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,129
He is impressive.

94
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,341
He's scarely returned to life
and already causing a ruckus.

95
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,759
I'm so proud of him!

96
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,469
What the hell's
he doing up there?

97
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,430
Seriously, does he
have to be so obnoxious?

98
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,643
Kushishishishi!

99
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,521
Guess none of me
stretches. Oh well.

100
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,773
I got some climbin' to do.

101
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,454
Alright. We got our
work cut out for us.

102
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,498
I doubt we're just
gonna turn the corner

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,791
and find the zombies
with our shadows in 'em.

104
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,834
Not only that.

105
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,336
Luffy's zombie is a
complete freak of nature!

106
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,505
He's six times
bigger than any giant!

107
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm not sure anyone
could beat him!

108
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,342
It's true. And not
only is he huge.

109
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,719
He's also got your shadow and
all of your fighting skills.

110
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,513
Like that makes
any damn difference.

111
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,974
Wait. What?

112
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,725
What's the point of pissing
our pants over how big

113
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,061
and strong they are when
we've still gotta beat 'em

114
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,605
if we want our shadows back?

115
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,693
Well, we don't really have
to worry about the zombies.

116
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,404
Though I kinda wanna
see how cool mine is.

117
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,572
[ZORO] What're you
talking about?

118
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,824
You wanna hide from the sun
for the rest of your life?

119
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,535
We've gotta get our shadows
back from those ghouls.

120
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,786
Yeah, but there's another way.

121
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,747
You remember what that
geezer zombie told us?

122
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,666
I saw you fight those zombies.

123
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,837
All of you have such
unbelievable strength!

124
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,090
Alright. So what did
you want to tell us?

125
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,385
[SPOIL] There's an evil man
who must be brought down!

126
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,054
And I think you youngsters
are strong enough to do it!

127
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,682
He's left a trail of
victims in his wake.

128
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,727
If you defeat him,
they'll all be rescued!

129
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,479
All we've gotta do
to free the shadows

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,773
is put an end to Gecko Moria.

131
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,993
He said that, huh?

132
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,538
Luffy, always gets
straight to the point.

133
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,832
[LUFFY] Up there.

134
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,044
Gecko Moria's just sitting
on his big ass waiting for us.

135
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,588
Whaaa? Are you nuts?

136
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,839
What do you mean?

137
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,926
His butt's asking for a kicking,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

138
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,969
And then all the
shadows will return.

139
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,473
Sanji. Fire up.
You're rescuing, Nami.

140
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:41,562
Yaaaah!! That's exactly
what I wanted to hear!

141
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,898
That invisible man's
gonna be the divisible man

142
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,024
when I'm done with him!

143
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,652
I'm gonna kick his
ass into fractions!

144
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,072
Hang on, Nami! I'm coming!

145
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,616
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
but the invisible guy?

146
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,452
Yeah, he spied on Nami
while she was taking a bath.

147
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,995
Uh, huh...

148
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,957
What the hell'd you say?!!

149
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:06,462
Arrrrrgh!!!
He... will... PAY!!!

150
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,641
Why'd you have to
add more fuel to the fire?

151
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,935
He not seem angry enough to you?

152
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,897
That loathsome invisible
pervert is gonna die!

153
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,443
Sanji, just exploded!

154
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,737
Auuuuugh!!

155
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,162
I feel like it's all my fault

156
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,707
since I let that creep take
Nami right in front of my eyes.

157
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,710
It's only right
that I go with Sanji.

158
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,169
And I'll also do anything

159
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,546
to stay away from Moria!

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,715
I'm worried about the
skeleton fighting on his own.

161
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,966
He needs backup.

162
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,344
If Strawhat beats Moria before
the skeleton's zombie wins,

163
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,387
then everything's cool.

164
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,514
Otherwise I've gotta work
overtime to help Brook

165
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,349
and hold on to
my own damn shadow.

166
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,561
I'll give you some extra
backup with that one, Franky.

167
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
I wanna see if this
legendary samurai

168
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,482
he's fighting lives up
to his reputation or not.

169
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,235
If we're picking.
Nami's my top priority.

170
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,071
That's the battle I'd
like to lend my hands to.

171
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,406
And once we get her back.

172
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,075
We can all take
down Moria as a team.

173
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,410
You say it like
it's no big deal

174
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,078
but did you forget who he is?

175
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,205
He's one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!

176
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,125
Yeah, but so what?
Crocodile was one too.

177
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,711
Auuugh!!
That's my point exactly!

178
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,422
Crocodile got this
close to killing you!

179
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,382
I'm begging you to be careful!

180
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,426
Seriously! I already warned you!

181
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,429
Your zombie is terrifying!
Terrifying!

182
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,222
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

183
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:44,769
I'm coming to
rescue you! Nami!

184
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,190
Heads up, you guys.

185
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,151
I had enough to make
one sack for each of you.

186
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,653
A little concoction of mine.

187
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,155
I call 'em Zombie
Death Salt Balls.

188
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,367
Ah... So this is what you
were whipping up earlier.

189
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,410
That's good thinking, Usopp.

190
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,621
Alright. If we're
gonna do this thing

191
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,290
there is one point
I cannot stress enough.

192
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,500
There may be a
lot of thick forests

193
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,793
on this island to hide in,

194
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,713
but there's no guarantee we can
avoid the sunlight at all times.

195
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,382
We're all only alive right now

196
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,300
because it's the
middle of the night.

197
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,967
In other words.

198
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,261
Sunrise is our literal deadline.

199
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,555
We have to get your
shadows back by then!

200
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,099
So don't forget it!

201
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,476
It's imperative that
we're outta here by dawn!

202
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,561
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,271
There's nothing worse
than going a whole night

204
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,731
on an empty stomach!

205
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,652
[LUFFY] We're gonna
make you regret you

206
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,154
even thought
about taking our food.

207
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,615
You hear me, Moria?!

208
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,825
We'll make him
give back twice

209
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,869
the amount he took
from us and before dawn!

210
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,496
[CREW] Yeah!

211
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,665
[USOPP] Wait, no, were
you not listening to me?

212
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,500
I was saying we gotta
get your shadows back...

213
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,167
[ZORO] Let's go!

214
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,252
[LUFFY] Right!

215
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,378
[SANJI] Nami!

216
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,838
[USOPP] Ah, screw it!

217
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,384
This is not good at all.

218
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,470
I gotta tell the master
before this gets serious.

219
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:16,694
Ohhhh! Cool!
This is one big ship!

220
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,365
Look a'that! Awesome!

221
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,379
You'd think it'd have a
better view of the sea.

222
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,382
But who needs a view
when life looks this good?

223
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,178
Aaaaah! Whew! Close one!

224
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,596
It's settled!

225
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,725
I'll use this ship to become
the King of the Pirates!

226
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,440
[MORIA] What's Oars
gotten himself into now?

227
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,650
He's climbed to the top
of the mast for some reason.

228
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,860
I couldn't tell you why.

229
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,404
Has he? Ahhh...

230
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,823
Hold on, Master,
just hear us out.

231
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,492
It just doesn't seem
like a good idea

232
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,244
to us to work with such
an uncontrollable monster.

233
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,955
I mean, the guy is capable
of destroying islands!

234
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,708
[ZOMBIE 355B] He's bad news,
sir! I just know it!

235
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,210
Calm down.

236
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,920
He just needs to be
properly broken in.

237
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,631
He'll be obedient
before you know it.

238
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,592
Yes, it's all in order.

239
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,928
With Oars at my command,
we can't be stopped.

240
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,765
And we'll continue to gather
even more powerful shadows.

241
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,642
Before you know it,
our undead army

242
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,937
will be stocked full of
unstoppable special zombies!

243
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,730
Kushishishi...

244
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,774
We're gonna need a mountain
of those marionettes

245
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,819
for what we have in
store. Eh, Hogback?

246
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,574
Leave it to me, Master!
Fasfasfasfas!

247
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,260
[HILDON] Dr. Hogback!

248
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:09,348
Emergency! The pirates!
The pirates!

249
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,435
What's the matter, Hildon?

250
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,980
Those three pirates whose
shadows we just claimed?

251
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,147
They woke up somehow

252
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,650
and now they're coming back
here with all their friends!

253
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,986
What? Impossible!

254
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,738
No one wakes up that quickly
after their shadow's taken!

255
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,407
I... I didn't see it myself,

256
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,534
but their friends seem
to have beaten them awake.

257
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,411
Anyway, it also seems
that they're in cahoots

258
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,912
with the humming swordsman.

259
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,913
[HILDON] That's probably

260
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,832
where they're getting
their information from.

261
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,750
The one thing I do
know for certain is

262
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,295
that he explained to the pirates
how to purify the zombies

263
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,713
and release their shadows!

264
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,506
Uh? What?

265
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,800
Kushishishi...

266
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,303
All the zombies are
terrified for their lives.

267
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,680
The pirates have
got them on the run.

268
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
He's a monster! Keep running!

269
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,612
[HOGBACK] The Wild Zombies,
Surprise Zombies,

270
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,780
the Zombie Soldiers-none
of them stand a chance

271
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,784
against these maniacs, even if
they didn't have salt with them!

272
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,538
Our only option is to
call the Zombie Generals!

273
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,081
But if they manage
to purify them,

274
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,958
then the pirates might win!

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,378
We need Absalom!
What the hell is he doing?

276
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,506
[HILDON] Uh, well, um...

277
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,843
I'm pretty sure his
wedding ceremony just began

278
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,011
and I'm also pretty sure that

279
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,847
all of the Zombie
Generals are attending.

280
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,519
You mean those idiots are
all gathered in one place?

281
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,066
Oh! I almost forgot to ask
you something important!

282
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,734
Absalom wanted to
know if he could use

283
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,403
your dance hall for
his wedding reception.

284
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,656
Well, I suppose.

285
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,741
A wedding is a
special beautiful event.

286
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,371
But tell me, do you think
this is a good time for dancing?

287
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,872
I don't care how,

288
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,916
but I want that
ceremony stopped!

289
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,709
It's just,
I'm one of his zombies

290
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,419
so it's completely
impossible for me

291
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,588
to go against anything he says.

292
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
Horo horo horo horo.

293
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,927
Just let the stupid
animal have his wedding.

294
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,345
[HOGBACK] What?

295
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,767
If I weaken the
pirates with my ghosts,

296
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,394
the Zombie Soldiers
can scoop them up

297
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,688
and carry them here
like docile kittens.

298
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,106
Just because they figured out

299
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
the zombies' weakness,
doesn't mean we need to panic.

300
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,860
I'll gather up
their entire crew

301
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,529
and have them
here lickity-split.

302
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,072
Go ahead and get
some marionettes ready

303
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,449
for the pirates that
still have their shadows.

304
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,952
I'll be in my room
if you need anything else.

305
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,787
Come on, Kumacy.

306
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,539
[KUMACY] Right. Sorry.

307
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,958
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo horo!

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,420
Excellent.
She's quite useful.

309
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,922
What would we begin
to do without her?

310
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,507
Huh?

311
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,467
You know, if you
wanted to be useful,

312
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,803
you could shut your
fat mouth. Like Kumacy.

313
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,141
Aaaah! Anyway. Everything
seems to be in order.

314
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,767
No reason to worry.

315
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,646
Ah. It seems that way.
Talk about boring.

316
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,481
So you're just
gonna sit there?

317
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,650
Is it any wonder why you're
always so bored?

318
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,486
Well I'm not bored
enough to bother standing.

319
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,989
I'll just wait here
for Oars to get back.

320
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,409
Well then. May I ask
a simple request?

321
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,829
If it doesn't make
any difference to you.

322
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,999
Could I be second-in-command
over Absalom's zombies?

323
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,834
Fine with me. It's yours.

324
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,170
Gather up whoever you
want and take 'em with you.

325
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,173
I appreciate your trust!

326
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,718
I have just the two in mind that
are best suited for the job.

327
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,185
Fasfasfasfas!

328
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,945
Moria! Where
the hell are you?

329
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,906
Oh, crap!

330
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,995
Get outta my way!
And give us back our food!

331
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,004
Which one of you's
the sick bastard

332
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,215
that spied on Nami in the bath?

333
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,675
It wasn't me, I swear it!

334
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,677
Show yourself!

335
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,064
You know, we might not even
need the salt after all.

336
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,608
Their anger's doing
the job just fine.

337
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,194
I don't even think they
remember about the shadows.

338
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,364
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 355D]
Captain!

339
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,991
Five of the pirates are storming
toward the dance hall!

340
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,034
Not only that,

341
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,411
but there's two more of
them on the bridge below!

342
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,207
There's no way we can
beat them! Retreat!

343
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,378
Aaaah!

344
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,435
I can't believe these slow,
stupid pieces of crap

345
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,520
managed to capture me!

346
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,689
The more I think about
the more it pisses me off!

347
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,399
I'm sure you developed
a pretty close bond

348
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,567
to me after I saved you.

349
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,402
Feel free to call me
'bro' if you want.

350
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,279
I'd rather get caught again!

351
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,699
Oh, no! Not good!

352
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,410
What is it?
What's wrong?

353
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,245
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo!

354
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,580
Gh-Gh-Ghosts!

355
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,715
[LUFFY] I don't even
deserve to be human.

356
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,551
I wish I was a mosquito.

357
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,802
[SANJI] I'm so ashamed.

358
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,763
My soul is as twisted
as my curly eyebrows.

359
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:45,434
Hey! Luffy, Sanji!
Why're you just lying there?

360
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,520
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Negative! Negative!

361
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,606
What the hell?
What happened to them?

362
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,608
Those ghosts sucked
the will out of them.

363
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,194
One touch from them and
they break your spirit.

364
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,613
I know that much.
But I don't know how to fix it.

365
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,450
Alright, c'mere. We got ya now.

366
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,036
You too.

367
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,123
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Negative! Negative!

368
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,334
[USOPP] Oh, c'mon!
They already caught them once!

369
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,294
Luffy! Sanji!

370
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,505
Dammit! Here goes. Lead Star!

371
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,470
[USOPP] Run for it!

372
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,808
We'll never get off this
ship if they catch us, too!

373
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,436
No matter what happens here,

374
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,772
just keep running
as fast as you can!

375
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,318
The ghosts are catching up!
They're right behind us!

376
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,319
No, stay away!

377
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,696
Things are negative
enough already, thank you!

378
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,615
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo!

379
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:46,328
This is not looking
good for us! Dammit!

380
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,751
Set sail! Argh! Hahahaha!

381
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,336
Huh?

382
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:15,232
Ah ah ah! I'm falling!

383
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,652
Usopp! Sanji!

384
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,715
They're gone. No.
They're okay. I'm sure they are.

385
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,633
That really
freaked me out though.

386
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,634
The stairs are
completely wiped out.

387
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,804
Holy crap! Where's the
rest of the building?

388
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,889
[CHOPPER] Something
came crashing through.

389
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,559
Usopp, Sanji,
those zombies, everyone.

390
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,811
They all fell down
with the stairs.

391
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,401
Their legs are twitching
so I'm sure they're fine,

392
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,320
nothing to worry about.

393
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,572
What I'm curious
about is this thing.

394
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,742
Well, whatever it is,
it's blocking our path.

395
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,161
Sure is a weird lookin' wall.

396
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,878
Dammit, what the
hell was that?

397
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,382
Uh... I think it was.

398
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,347
Hmm? It's not made of rock.

399
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,432
[FRANKY] Weapons Left!

400
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,519
[FRANKY] What the...?
It didn't even put a dent in it!

401
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:39,274
Auuuugh!! What the hell
are you guys doing?

402
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,235
[ZORO] It's just a wall.
A big, pink fleshy wall.

403
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,904
[USOPP]
That's not a wall, you moron!

404
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,615
That thing's Luffy's zombie!

405
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,241
No way.

406
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,998
[USOPP]
Auuuughhh!!

407
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,209
Uh?! It's huge.

408
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,672
Luffy's...

409
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,217
[CREW]
...z-zombie?

410
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,315
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo horo!

411
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,025
Now that you've become
intimately acquainted

412
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,777
with my fearsome ghosts.

413
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,987
There's nothing left
to do but annihilate you.

414
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,656
[USOPP] Hold on.
Who's getting annihilated?

415
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,865
[PERONA]
Anyone can act tough,

416
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,326
but you rarely
find the real deal.

417
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,536
Negative Hollow!

418
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,996
[USOPP] You make a habit of
underestimating people, huh?

419
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,706
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

420
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,417
"Usopp's the Strongest?

421
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,377
Leave Anything Negative to Him!"

422
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,963
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
