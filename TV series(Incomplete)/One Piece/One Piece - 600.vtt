hurt you so much,

00:12:48.934 --> 00:12:51.203
I'm going to need
you to kill them.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:54.740
For candy?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.510
[grunts]

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:01.347
[grunting]

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.682
Just grab a pipe or a big rock

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.818
and crush their
miserable skulls!

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.990
[BOYS grunting]

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:13.759
[BOYS shout]

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.761
No... Stop.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:18.798
I can't move. I'm blacking out.

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:22.401

[NAMI (SANJI) pants]

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.968
It's Brownbear!

00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.102
That's close, but no.

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:35.174
Forgive me, Straw Hats! Ha!
I finally see the truth!

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:39.511
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.348
Wait, who are you again?

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.651
Oh, yes! You're one of my
dutiful lackeys, aren't you?

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.653
Your name was, uh--

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:52.024
Brownbeard! Left me for dead
and forgot about me already?

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:55.094
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.129
I was only kidding, of course!

00:14:57.162 --> 00:15:00.165
But what happened to you?
All those awful injuries.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.800
Why, it looks like
you were shot!

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.269
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:07.873
You can't fool me!
I know what you did!

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.141
[BROWNBEARD gasps]

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:13.913
[BROWNBEARD]
Huh?

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:24.323
Ah. It's all coming back now.

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:26.825
[SCOTCH]
You're Brownbeard, aren't you?

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:31.463
Just so ya know, you happen
to be on our hit list, too.

00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:34.033
[CAESAR CLOWN] He's a fool, so
it was easy to manipulate him.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.135
But now he's become
a nuisance.

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:39.738
I don't need his
services anymore. Kill him.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.909
[CAESAR CLOWN]
The Cool Brothers.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:48.881
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs] Yes, I do
recall asking a favor from them.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:54.920
And all this time,
I trusted you.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.588
No reason to be mad!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.092
[CAESAR CLOWN]
I underestimated your worth,

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.727
but it's all water
under the bridge now.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.429
You're still alive.

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.098
Why it seems everything
is just dandy!

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:08.000
[BROWNBEARD]
Shut your mouth!

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.369
[BROWNBEARD yells]

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.338
I'll kill you!

[CHILDREN shout]

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.846
Careful, children!
It's dangerous here!

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:24.183
You'd better get aboard the
Flying Gas Balloon outside!

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.585
I'll be with you shortly!

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.388
[CHILDREN yell]

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.024
Wait, don't go!
We can still help you!

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:34.626
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.228
Caesar!

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.901
It's my fault that you
tricked me. That's fine.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:45.771
I'll bear that
suffering on my own.

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:50.542
But I won't let my crew
go through the same hell.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:54.480
Give them back. I'm taking my
men and leaving this place!

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:58.017
[CHILDREN shouting]

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:02.654
Huh?!

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.892
"Your" men? There's no
such thing, you fool!

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:09.561
If I recall, every last one
of you pledged your allegiance

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:11.430
to me when you came here.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:13.999
You're not the captain
of anything anymore.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.835
You're a failure!
You'd all be dead without me!

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.470
[BROWNBEARD growls]

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.973
[USOPP] Hey, Nami!
Let's go after the kids.

00:17:21.006 --> 00:17:22.608
Right!

00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:24.443
[CAESAR CLOWN] All the little
fools who couldn't make it

00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:28.313
in the New World will keep
worshipping me as their savior!

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.749
They're not good
for anything else.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.851
I only keep them around
as my guinea pigs,

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.787
just waiting for
their turn to die!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.222
I'm gonna smash you!

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.699
[CAESAR CLOWN]

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.336
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.175
[USOPP gasps]
That looks bad.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.377
Do you think he's okay?

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.645
[BOTH shout]

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.214

[CAESAR CLOWN]
Gastanet!

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.630
They're going to chase
us forever, aren't they?

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:20.732
How long until we
reach the lab?

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.168
Huh?

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:27.806
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Dammit!

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.175
[ZORO gasps] There's nothing
left on the other side

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:32.845
of the lake. It made it across.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.379
[KIN'EMON] At least we know
we won't have any more

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:35.881
to contend with.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:43.122
All the pieces are
forming together again.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.395
[BROOK] It's getting
rather large, I'm afraid!

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.998
[ZORO] Doesn't matter.
Just keep running to the lab!

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:57.436
Right! I'm on my way!
Momonosuke!

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.608
Open up the damn door!

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.376
Give us our
Captain back, now!

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.044
[MARINE D] And Smokey,
while you're at it!

00:19:08.213 --> 00:19:10.616
[MARINE B]
Huh? Is it leaving, or what?

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.426
Creepy. All of 'em are
headed the same way.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.962
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.607
[CHOPPER]
All right.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.210
I've got some sedatives and
I know how the drug works.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:40.712
This wasn't supposed
to be a rescue mission,

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:42.681
but I'll come up with something.

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:48.320
[CHOPPER]
Easy... Easy...

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.154
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.456
[CHOPPER yelps]

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:58.297
[CHOPPER]
Whoa. What was that?

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.402
[GIRL G]
I need my candy.

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:05.904
[BOY I] Why hasn't
the Master come back?

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:07.472
[BOY P]
Master.

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:11.810
[GIRL I] Where did you go?
You said you'd be here.

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:17.916
[CAESAR CLOWN] This is Caesar.
Are you there, Monet?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:18.884
[MONET]
Uh-huh.

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:21.787
I retrieved the
children without difficulty.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.189
Did you prepare Smiley's food,
as I asked?

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:26.291
I followed your instructions
to the letter,

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.361
so everything is in
good order. As always.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.366
[MONET] The Marines are still
stuck in front of the shutters.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.570
[MONET] We can transfer the
Straw Hats whenever you see fit.

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:42.007
[MONET]
And the Video Transponder Snails

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.675
are on standby outside.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:47.312
[CAESAR CLOWN] I see. So when my
adorable little Smiley arrives,

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:49.014
we can broadcast the experiment

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:51.383
for all of our
associates to see?

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:54.052
[MONET]
Certainly.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.556
Splendid. Connect me
to all the receivers now.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:58.757
[MONET]
Right away.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.566
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Ahem!

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.902
A fond hello, to all you
illicit brokers out there.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.872
I do apologize for
the short notice.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:17.643
But you're about to witness
something extraordinary.

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:19.678
I've found the
perfect opportunity

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.513
for this demonstration.

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:23.882
This is a poison gas
weapon I've developed.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.984
Much like the one
you saw four years ago,

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.719
but with some new
features the Government

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.855
could never hope to recreate.

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:32.224
At any rate, it just so
happens that I have some

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:35.160
uninvited guests on the island.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.363
They're going to aid me
in my live test today.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:47.039
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Intimidation, war, annihilation.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:49.374
It has a variety of uses.

00:21:49.408 --> 00:21:52.010
If it happens to
tickle your fancy,

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:54.613
I would be more than
happy to make a deal.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.316
[MARINE C]
You can't stop us forever!

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:02.854
[KILLER] Poison doesn't
seem like your style.

00:22:02.888 --> 00:22:05.357
[KID]
It's not.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:10.462
But, hey. It never hurts to
watch a little carnage, does it?

00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:20.572
[NARRATOR] The grusome details
of the secret agreement

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:23.375
between Law and
Caesar become clear.

00:22:23.408 --> 00:22:26.078
Meanwhile, while fleeing
the smilies,

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.914
Zoro's group encounters
a giant object.

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:31.149
One that marks the true
beginning of Caesar's

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.218
horrifying project.

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:34.920
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:39.057
"Shaking up the New World!
Caesar's Horrendous Experiment!"

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.960
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
