00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.968
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:41.561
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:46.799
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.968
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.336
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.605
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.507
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.910
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.612
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.284
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.852
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.556
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.693
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.298
[NARRATOR] The first
stop on Luffy's journey

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.801
is Fishman Island, thousands
of feet below sea level,

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.938
where his crew becomes
involved in a civil war.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.173
After meeting with Jimbei
in the Sea Forest,

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.243
they learn of the island's hero,
Fisher Tiger, who freed

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:33.713
the slaves from Marie Jois
and formed the Sun Pirates.

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.249
However, when he faced
an untimely death,

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:39.452
his crew was left to pick up
the pieces of his dream.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:45.225
[SUN PIRATES crying]

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:49.262
[SUN PIRATES]
No!

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.869
[LUFFY] "The Sun Pirates Split!
Jimbei vs. Arlong!"

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.244
[JIMBEI] That is how our captain
and our hero met his end--

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:07.080
not in triumph, but in tragedy.

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:11.618
It is etched into my mind--
a scene that will never fade.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.822
[JIMBEI]
Tiger's death...

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:19.192
I believe you all know
how painful it was for us.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:23.296
Suddenly, we were
a crew without a captain.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:28.101
We felt so lost, and then
we began to splinter apart.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:37.510
[thud]

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.612
[HACHI grunting]

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.247
Arlong! Please stay back!

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.350
Don't hurt any humans?
What a load of crap!

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.520
See what happens to us
when we show them mercy?

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.088
Get offa me!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:49.956
[HACHI groans]

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:53.526
[ARLONG]
Brother Tai, he was a damn fool!

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.296
You're wrong!

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.897
[ARLONG grunts]

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.838
Wait! No!

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:09.075
Arlong!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.580
Sorry, Tiger, but you're wrong.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:17.016
I'll never forgive them!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.994
[MARINES groan]

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:31.264
All right, you punks!
Get ready to die!

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.099
A Fishman? He must be from--

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.600
[ARLONG laughs]

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:35.968
[MARINE groans]

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:41.341
[ARLONG laughing]

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.710
He's awful noisy, isn't he?

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:48.848
[ARLONG groans]

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:54.520
[KIZARU]
Arlong, was it?

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.791
[KIZARU]
So what brings you here?

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:00.827
You wanna start
trouble that bad?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.894
[ARLONG gasps]

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.838
Not too smart if you ask me.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.106
Outta my way!

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.309
I'm goin' after all the lousy
humans who betrayed my captain!

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:18.878
And you Navy scum can't stop me!

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:21.547
[KIZARU]
Oh, so this is about revenge.

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:24.684
Damn straight!
You killed Fisher Tiger!

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.754
I don't care what happens to me,
but you deserve to die!

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:30.857
Oh, so your friend
is dead. I see.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.724
[ARLONG gasps]

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.559
[KIZARU]
Well, you can cry if you like,

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:35.862
but either way,
you're coming with me now.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.765
[ARLONG growls]

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:43.469
Arlong was enraged
by Brother Tiger's death.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:47.707
He took his anger out on humans,
and was imprisoned as a result.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.876
There, his hatred grew.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.911
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL buzzing]

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:54.781
If he had a transfusion,
he'd be fine!

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:58.985
Instead, he had to die because
they refused to treat Fishmen!

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:01.287
He brought that little
girl back to her family,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.990
and you repaid
that by killing him!

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:08.861
[JIMBEI] "Fisher Tiger,
Captain of the Sun Pirates,

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:13.299
Dies After Being Denied
a Transfusion of Human Blood."

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:16.536
Not quite, though it is close.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.706
Regardless, the captain's dead,
and humans played a big role.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.341
Arlong lied to them.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.910
Why would he do such a thing?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.846
Good for him.
The truth is a lot worse.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.149
Tiger chose to save that girl
despite his own prejudice.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:31.684
Yet humans still betrayed him,

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:34.120
so he coldly refused
to accept their blood.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.522
On top of that, he was a slave.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:38.558
If any of this became public,

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.828
they would have attacked
Tiger's character,

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:45.097
so let Arlong tell
his little white lies.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.236
[HACHI]
Nyu!

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:53.940
Hey! Captain Jimbei!
Enemy ship ahead!

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:55.675
The boss may not be with us,

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:59.312
but we still have
to keep moving forward!

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.380
Prepare yourselves!

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.850
Follow Tiger's wishes
and do not kill anyone!

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.652
[SUN PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.692
[JIMBEI]
From that day forward,

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.394
I bore the title
"First Son of the Sea,"

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:19.232
and fought to do my best as
Captain of the Sun Pirates.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.234
Though in truth,
fighting seemed to be

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.736
the only thing
our crew was doing.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.840
[NEPTUNE]
"I am writing this because

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.009
I thought that the two
of you deserved to know

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.912
the whole truth
about what happened."

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:37.884
Signed, "Jimbei,
Captain of the Sun Pirates."

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:40.553
My mind's made up.

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:41.621
[NEPTUNE]
In the end,

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:45.758
Fisher Tiger lived the
only way that he knew how.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.893
Poor soul.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:50.796
I finally understand the
pain that he felt that day.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.412
As their leader,
I must remain strong.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.481
I won't give in!

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:11.350
We too shall live under the sun,

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.020
and try to understand
one another!

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.121
If I may...

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:17.390
Signing here is the
first step to harmony!

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.425
With all due respect,
Queen Otohime,

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.860
you must be out of your mind!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.829
Fisher Tiger freed countless
slaves, both Fishman and human!

00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:26.265
He didn't care about
what race they were!

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.568
Yet humans still
refused to help him!

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.937
Who cares about understanding?

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:37.143
[OTOHIME] Another fruitless
day without any signatures.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:39.879
[GROUP]
Mother!

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:41.681
My sweet children!

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.486
Hey, Mother? Are you okay?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.323
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI] Yeah,
what's wrong? You look so sad!

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.792
Mother, you really
need some rest!

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.694
Aww.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.996
You children brighten my day.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.132
I'm fine. Don't worry!

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.435
Okay, I won't!

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.870
[ALL]
If you say so, Mother!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.807
I'll keep doing my best...

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.810
...to make this world
a better place for everyone!

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:17.583
[JIMBEI] Queen Otohime was
working so hard, day after day.

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.159
[JIMBEI] She rescued
humans from shipwrecks.

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:31.030
[MEN groaning]

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.298
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Are you all right?

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.633
[AMMO KNIGHT B]
Pirates must have hit them.

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.035
[MAN A groans]
Please help me.

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:37.703
[OTOHIME]
Don't worry, we're here.

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.506
Bring the wounded to the island!

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.710
[JIMBEI] She taught the island
children about the world above.

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:45.845
[OTOHIME]
Does anybody remember

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.115
what this area with many
trees is called? You, there!

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:52.118
[MERCHILD A]
Forest, like the Sea Forest!

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.586
[JIMBEI]
And collected signatures.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:54.787
[BOTH whimper]

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.589
[OTOHIME]
Please wait!

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:57.790
[BOTH panting]

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.359
[OTOHIME] I just need
a moment of your time!

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.897
[JIMBEI]
However...

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.401
[FISHMAN G]
Queen Otohime!

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:10.970
Oh! Hello, again!

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.906
Thank you for showing
your support the other day!

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:16.008
Actually, about that...

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.109
We're curious...

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.944
How many signatures do you have?

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:21.714
Well, I've been collecting
them for five years now.

00:11:21.747 --> 00:11:23.315
One hundred sheets
have been signed,

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:26.252
with each containing
ten signatures.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.288
So that adds up
to 1,000 supporters!

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:32.024
Still, the population of
the island is five million

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:33.626
so we're not done yet.

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.528
Step by step, right?

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:38.464
[FISHMAN G]
Um...

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.599
We have kind of
a big favor to ask.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:42.668
We'd like to withdraw
our signatures.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:45.304
They total about
half of what you have.

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.239
Does that... sound okay?

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:48.174
Huh?

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.376
You must not have
heard about it, but...

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:53.713
...those human pirates that
you rescued the other day...

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.982
[FISHMAN H] ...they
committed a robbery in town

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.185
before escaping from the island.

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.994
Your Majesty...

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.262
Queen Otohime!

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:13.866
Oh, hello, children! Are you
ready for another lesson yet?

May I help you?

00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.453
I do hope there's
no hard feelings,

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:36.388
what with you being
the queen and all.

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:41.894
We just can't do it.
Humans are too evil.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.765
[MERMAN A]
We'll pass on the speeches, too.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:48.100
[FISHMAN K]
Yeah. Sorry about all this.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.505
[FISHMAN L]
We've just had enough.

00:12:57.042 --> 00:12:59.111
[RYUBOSHI, MANBOSHI]
Ah!

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.714
[SHIRAHOSHI giggles]
Surprise, Mommy!

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.916
Did we scare you?

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.319
[OTOHIME yawns]
What an exhausting day!

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.889
I think I might have
overdone it a bit out there.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.123
I'm sorry, sweeties,

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:14.160
but could you give your
mother some alone time today?

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:15.628
Huh?

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:22.535
[OTOHIME crying]

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:27.573
[sobbing]

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.747
[NEPTUNE]
Mm...

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:40.219
[loudspeaker blares]

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:41.887
[OTOHIME]
You... [panting]

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:46.392
You're all... liars!

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:51.130
[FISHMEN, MERFOLK
gasping, chattering]

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.164
[yells]

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.132
Your Majesty!

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:57.436
This is on the air!
Everyone can hear you!

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.637
[OTOHIME hiccups]

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:01.807
Why don't you shaddup...

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:05.411
...Mister at the Left!

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.131
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Majesty!

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.100
Have you been drinking?

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.903
Mind your bizness, got it?

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:35.441
Leaf me alone!
I'm not... drunk at all.

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.676
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Yes, you are! Goodness!

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.011
[MERMAN B]
What's happening?

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.380
[FISHWOMAN B]
Is that really Queen Otohime?

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:44.550
[OTOHIME]
Everybody better lissen to me!

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:47.152
You can live however you want!

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.121
If that means
staying in this island,

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:52.725
then I can't stop you,
neither can anyone else!

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:57.129
But in the vastness
of the ocean, so broad,

00:14:57.162 --> 00:15:01.867
and on the seafloor,
foreboding and dark.

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.969
[yells]

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:07.973
[OTOHIME] We chose this tiny
place and this place alone!

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:10.476
Do you have any idea why?

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.945
Queen Otohime...

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.280
[OTOHIME]
Isn't it because this is where

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:18.784
we can get a bit of sunlight?
Where we can get a bit of air?

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:22.087
Luxuries down here are
plentiful above ground!

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.757
Light illuminates
the entire surface,

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.360
and the sky stretches
out as far as you can see!

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.001
[OTOHIME]
Our children--

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:40.072
why do they always sneak out to
catch a glimpse of Sabaody Park?

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.640
Huh?

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.008
[OTOHIME crying]

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.844
Can't ya see?!

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.913
The world is filled
with more beauty

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:51.083
than any of us can even imagine!

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:54.353
There's no place that we
shouldn't be able to go.

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:57.489
Why restrict ourselves
to this bubble?

00:15:57.523 --> 00:16:00.726
I know you tell yourselves
life down here is comfortable,

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.928
that you're safe.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.832
Do you want to spend
the rest of your lives trapped?

00:16:06.865 --> 00:16:10.169
Dig deep! Summon your courage!

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:12.838
Once you have it,
pursue your dreams!

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.974
No matter the cost!

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:17.876
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Your Majesty...

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.480
If humans stand in your way,
we'll face them together!

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:24.550
You don't have to confront
your fears alone!

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:26.251
And maybe then...

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:29.021
...we can finally make
a difference for the future--

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:32.324
for our children,
for the island.

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.462
Even if it's just a small one!

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:41.500
[OTOHIME crying]

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:58.283
It's rough. I left my family
behind on Fishman Island.

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:00.285
My wife and kids.

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.855
Hope they're doin' okay.

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:06.325
[ALADDIN] Going home again
isn't that simple. Not for us.

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.563
We're escaped slaves,
and pirates to boot,

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:14.800
so we gotta put our
own dreams on hold.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.436
We might be stuck sailing
for the rest of our lives.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.138
[gasps] I'm sorry.

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:22.041
Y'know, I'm sure my
family's doin' okay!

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:29.581
My goodness,
you've seen better days.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.483
[STRAWBERRY]
He was formidable.

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.484
I see.

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:35.854
He certainly did
a number on you, didn't he?

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.122
[STRAWBERRY]
Arlong...

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:40.025
...the Fishman that we just
locked up in Impel Down?

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.927
He was nothing...

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.029
...but you have to watch
out for this one.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.197
Jimbei!

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.367
[inaudible]

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:53.572
He's quite strong, even
by Fishman standards.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:57.643
He's far too dangerous at large.
We should bring him in.

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.845
Huh...

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.317
[JIMBEI]
Unbelievable!

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.386
Me, in the Seven Warlords?

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:11.590
Oh, it's not that surprising!
You're worth 250 million.

00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:12.825
With a bounty that big,

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:15.327
they definitely see you as a
threat to the World Government!

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.662
That's the highest
praise a pirate

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:18.497
can get from those chumps!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.967
Macro's right! They're
finally taking us seriously!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.735
All you need to
do is reject them!

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.705
That'll really help us
pile on the notoriety!

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.374
No one will ever
mess with us! Choo!

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:31.610
My mind is made up.

00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.679
I'm going to take
the Navy's offer.

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.414
[SUN PIRATES]
What?!

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.416
[NEPTUNE]
Welcome home, Jimbei!

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:41.019
I heard about the
Seven Warlords proposal.

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:43.755
[JIMBEI] If I join, Aladdin
and the other crew members

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:46.859
who do not wish to be pirates
no longer have to be.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.795
They can live in this country
without fear of retribution.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.664
It's a way for me
to take care of my men.

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.068
But more importantly,
if I do become a Warlord,

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:59.371
it will help the Fishmen become
closer to the World Government.

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.273
We need that relationship.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:04.543
I can atone for all the trouble
that we've caused the queen.

00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:07.679
[NEPTUNE]
Mm... Thank you.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:11.917
At the moment, she's...
not feeling very well.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:16.221
In the end, we might
see Tiger's dream:

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:20.759
Liberation and freedom
for all Fishmen, everywhere!

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:24.396
Though, then again,
we'd have to watch our own.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:27.766
There are some less
deserving of amnesty.

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:37.476
[SUN PIRATES shouting]

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:41.079
[HACHI]
Arlong! [laughs]

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.148
[SUN PIRATE G]
Welcome back, buddy!

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.117
[CHOO]
It's really you!

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:50.822
[SUN PIRATES shouting, cheering]

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.090
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.661
[JIMBEI] If you have
something to say to me,

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.529
then you'd better speak up now!

00:19:57.563 --> 00:20:01.266
You expect a thank you?
For becoming a sell out?

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.671
You may have set me free,
but the Navy owns you!

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:09.408
Have you forgotten what
Brother Tai said before he died?

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:12.444
You mustn't let anger and
bitterness overwhelm you!

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.812
Tch!

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.215
Sounds to me like
you've gotten soft.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.717
Sure, I'd probably be safer
if I followed your lead,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.852
but there's no way
in hell I'm doing that!

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.155
You can't make me stay!

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:26.525
In case you forgot,
Tiger is dead!

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:30.062
Which means I'm free--
free to lead my own crew!

00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:33.966
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll be taking back my men.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.867
Got a problem with that?

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.770
You fool.
You damn ignorant fool.

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:41.273
Hey, now, enough
with the name-calling.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:43.942
Let's end this...

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:46.712
...right now, just you and me!

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:49.248
What? Arlong, no!

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.984
[ARLONG] If you don't
do it, I'm free to go.

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:55.988
Fair warning--I won't
go down easily.

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.856
You'll have to kill me!

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:00.259
Arrogant punk!

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:03.395
[ARLONG groaning]

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.666
Don't do this!

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.234
[chuckles]

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.069
[ARLONG]
That's more like it!

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:13.505
[ARLONG growls]

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:14.539
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:15.607
[ARLONG groans]

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.717
[HACHI whimpers]

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:27.319
[HACHI]
Please, stop it!

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.822
Jimbei, no!

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:32.924
[ARLONG groans]

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:37.963
[JIMBEI panting]

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.574
[JIMBEI]
Do whatever you want!

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.476
[HACHI, CHOO]
Arlong!

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.146
[ALADDIN]
I wouldn't dwell on it.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.315
There's nothing
you could've done.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:02.587
You've known each other
since childhood, after all.

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.324
Like him or not, he's still
like a brother to you.

00:22:05.357 --> 00:22:07.359
And you're no killer.

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:09.294
He's blinded by hate.

00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:15.067
He'll never understand what
Tiger meant by his dying words!

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.502
[ALADDIN] It doesn't
matter how far he goes.

00:22:17.536 --> 00:22:19.438
As long as Arlong
engages in violence,

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:20.972
the Navy will be after him.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.307
Worse comes to worst--

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:26.945
we may have to stop Arlong
ourselves one day, at any cost!

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:29.214
Only time will tell.

00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:32.084
[MACRO] Look, I'd love to
stay and chat, Captain Jimbei,

00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:35.687
but we're headed out, too.
Good luck. You're gonna need it.

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.622
[SUN PIRATE A]
Macro, come back here!

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.224
If they want to leave, let 'em.

00:22:39.257 --> 00:22:41.893
[MACRO]
So long, suckers!

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.800
Damn it. He's stronger
than I realized.

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:50.502
[HACHI]
Nyu...

00:22:50.535 --> 00:22:52.704
Hachi, you can't look back.

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.339
[HACHI whimpers]

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:58.710
The Sun Pirates split
into three groups,

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:02.247
with Arlong, Macro,
and myself as captains.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.815
And ever since then,

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:07.052
we have continued going
our separate ways.
