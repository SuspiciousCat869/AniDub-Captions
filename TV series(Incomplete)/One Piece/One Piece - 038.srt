now join in the fight.

00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,139
to squash these insects,

179
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,810
you could destroy all
of Arlong Park. Choo.

180
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,549
Please just let us
kill these weaklings!

181
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,185
All right... They're yours.

182
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,192
Uh, guys... There's
something I should tell you.

183
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,232
What the hell's
that octopus doing?

184
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,168
Octopus is best when
it's cut thin and salted...

185
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,670
Add some olive oil and paprika

186
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,372
and it makes the perfect
snack while drinking.

187
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,209
So listen to me guys
I'm kind of in trouble...

188
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,544
Take this! Zero Vision!

189
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,113
Hachi Ink Jet!

190
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,620
Idiot...! How come
you didn't dodge that?!

191
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:19,425
Aaaaaah!
I can't see squat!

192
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,594
Now to finish you off!

193
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,132
C'mon! Get outta
there, Luffy! Run!

194
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,869
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that's the problem...

195
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,105
I can't run! I can't even walk!

196
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,208
Huh?

197
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,477
[LUFFY]
My feet are kinda stuck!

198
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,612
But you're the one who stuck 'em

199
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,614
into the ground
in the first place!

200
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,782
Always thinking ahead.

201
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,754
One Hachi Ink Jet
served on the rocks!

202
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,578
You're such a pain...

203
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,814
Sanji that was so
totally awesomely awesome!

204
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,651
Looks like I ended up
picking one hell of an idiot

205
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,486
to be my captain.

206
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,321
We all did.

207
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,658
Luffy's great...! Hey!

208
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,625
But the truth...

209
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,861
...is that our idiot
Captain is far better

210
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,830
than a gang who'd
prey on a lady.

211
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,302
A lady, huh? Hmph!

212
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,672
You rushed into certain
death for one lousy girl?

213
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,507
I think that's the
most ridiculous thing

214
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,342
I've ever heard.

215
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,210
"Lousy girl"...?

216
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,845
If you insult Nami
one more time,

217
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:50,716
I can promise that you'll go
from fishman to fish sticks...

218
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,984
Got that?

219
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,321
[KUROOBI] You're skills are
quite exceptional for a human...

220
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,855
But I must admit that chivalry

221
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,391
from a pirate seems
just a little fake.

222
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,895
I'm damn good at what I do,

223
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,364
and I guarantee
you there's nothing fake

224
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,234
about my desire to help
a beautiful lady in need.

225
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,972
Looks like I'll be
acquainting you

226
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:17,009
with the true superiority
of the fishman species.

227
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,577
Yeah?

228
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,656
Nice work...
But they're still stuck.

229
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,859
[USOPP]
Still? They're still stuck?

230
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,562
We could pull all day...

231
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,264
And I bet my legs would
still be stuck in there.

232
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,666
Hey, are you trying at all?!

233
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,735
Or do you want
to stay stuck here?!

234
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,836
Maybe no one told you,

235
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,240
that the penalty for playing
around in Arlong Park...

236
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,241
...is death!

237
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,876
[USOPP panicked cries]
C'mon!

238
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,411
Get unstuck already!
Get unstuck!

239
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,413
Please Luffy! Come on!

240
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:56,749
Come here!

241
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,417
[ZORO]
Hey, Octopus!

242
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,520
They're a little bit
busy at the moment.

243
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,589
Why don't you take me on?

244
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,893
Ohh!! You're Zoro...!
I forgot...!

245
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,263
You can't get away
with tricking me!

246
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,568
[HATCHAN] And how dare
you mercilessly slaughter

247
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,871
so many of my brothers!

248
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,440
That stuff's old news,
octopus man...

249
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,308
I personally don't care
what reasons you have

250
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,410
for wanting to kill me.

251
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,412
The situation has changed...

252
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,381
You see the
tables have turned...

253
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,617
You're not the hunters
anymore understand?

254
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,788
Now it's you fish freaks
who're being hunted!

255
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,960
Yeah you tell him Zoro...

256
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,464
That octopus guy
is yours... Nice.

257
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,900
Luffy!

258
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,301
Huh?

259
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,974
Hey, I'm back.

260
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,512
Oh, you're dead.

261
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,448
Aw, crap.

262
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,916
I get it now...

263
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,985
You must actually
want me to kill you.

264
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,458
Hold on...

265
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,694
Wasn't that the guy who
saved Genzo's life earlier?

266
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,666
Hey, wait... You're the
people from Cocoyashi.

267
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,668
Judging from the fact
that you all have weapons,

268
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,370
I can only assume
that this is a rebellion.

269
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,339
Then you'll all have to‐‐

270
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,475
[USOPP]
Exploding Star!

271
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,010
[YOSAKU]
Big Bro Usopp!

272
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,681
Did you think it would be easy?!

273
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,016
You're dealing with me now!

274
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,385
Enough!

275
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,654
I'm going to get
rid of you right now!

276
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,624
[USOPP screams]

277
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,693
Who is that lad?

278
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,995
Brave one minute
and cowardly the next.

279
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,997
He's a baffling man.

280
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,135
[CHOO]
Get back here "long nose"!

281
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,036
[USOPP] Oh, you're one
to talk "big mouth."

282
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,808
[NOJIKO]
Why are these people pirates?

283
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,485
You morons are a
pathetic sight to behold.

284
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,720
I'm sick of watching this.

285
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,655
Now get out of my way.

286
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,523
But sir,

287
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,358
there's no reason
to go on a rampage.

288
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,826
Think of Arlong Park.

289
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,394
[ARLONG]
Don't worry I won't.

290
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,664
I just thought of
a fun game that's all.

291
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,533
Game, huh?

292
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,501
Now you're going down!

293
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,010
Do you honestly think your
sad little group can defeat us?

294
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,945
So what if we do.

295
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,548
Yeah, so what if we do, huh?

296
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,682
Now let go!

297
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,418
You got something to say to us?

298
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,365
[LUFFY]
No way! No way! No way!

299
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,867
Did you know that those

300
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,902
with Devil Fruit
powers can't swim?

301
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,038
But honestly,
anybody in this situation

302
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,407
would sink right to the bottom.

303
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,875
Hahahaha!

304
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,611
The sea...?! No!

305
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,048
Gum‐Gum Pistol!

306
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,553
Ouchie!

307
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,488
You fool.

308
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,759
How pointless.

309
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,432
[ZORO]
Luffy!

310
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,467
[SANJI]
Damn you!

311
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:45,777
[ARLONG]
Ahahahahaha!

312
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,613
[ZORO]
Wait! Don't be stupid!

313
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,414
Those fishmen
can't wait for us to jump

314
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,582
in the water after him...

315
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,652
They'd have an obvious advantage
in an underwater fight.

316
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,924
[ZORO] There's only
one way to save Luffy.

317
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,126
We gotta take these guys
out at the same time,

318
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,495
then go in the water.

319
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,797
[ZORO] There's no time,
come on, let's do it.

320
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,632
[SANJI]
Yeah.

321
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,001
So, how long can
he hold out huh...?

322
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,669
Time is ticking.

323
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,604
Oh, so that's the game.

324
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,505
I get it.

325
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,642
[ARLONG laughs]

326
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,211
You can take the fish.

327
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,114
You slice and trim the octopus.

328
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,990
Hahaha!

329
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,673
[LUFFY] This is bad...
I'm almost outta breath!

330
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,541
What now?!
He can't help himself!

331
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,809
What do we do?!

332
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,145
Big Bro Luffy's gonna die!

333
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,019
[ARLONG laughs]

334
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,588
They can't even
breathe underwater!

335
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,558
Humans are such pitiful
creatures, aren't they?

336
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,660
Hahahahaha!

337
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,163
Hey...! Calamari...! Let's go!

338
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:15,767
[HATCHAN laughs]

339
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,269
Game! Game!

340
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,672
I'll kick your ass
in five seconds flat!

341
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,207
We don't have more than three!

342
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,676
Hey... What's the rush...?

343
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,878
You're both running
headlong into death...

344
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,514
None of you will
leave this place alive.

345
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,933
[HATCHAN]
Hachi Ink Jet!

346
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,868
[ZORO]
Hang on...

347
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,570
...Luffy!

348
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,711
[USOPP]
Aw, crap! I'm gonna be killed!

349
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,986
<i>All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

350
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,988
<i>I cannot understand</i>

351
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,090
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

352
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,893
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

353
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,661
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>
