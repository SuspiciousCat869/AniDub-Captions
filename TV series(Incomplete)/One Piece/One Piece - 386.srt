351
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,428
than I give them credit for!

352
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:49,296
See? Check it out.

353
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,999
They're drawing
an arrow in the water!

354
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:53,000
Perfect!

355
00:14:53,033 --> 00:14:55,035
We shouldn't have any
problem following that!

356
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:58,005
That's just--
Wow, so cool!

357
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:58,872
Oh, stop.

358
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:00,507
Any mermaid could
do the same thing.

359
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,942
Don't be so modest!

360
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:02,810
We don't know any better!

361
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,912
[USOPP] Okay! I'm gonna
take the helm!

362
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,047
[ROBIN]
Four o'clock, Usopp.

363
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:08,082
Got it!

364
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:15,623
All right!

365
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:17,057
We ready?

366
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:21,170
Go!

367
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,124
[MACRO] So there you
have it, Master Duval.

368
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,493
Everything's going
according to plan.

369
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,562
They fell right into our trap.

370
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,865
The mermaid's on her way
here even as we speak.

371
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,105
[DUVAL]
Good.

372
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,139
Hey, men.

373
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:14,940
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Yeah, boss?

374
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,809
[DUVAL]
Go greet our new friends.

375
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,043
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Yes, sir.

376
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,118
[MACRO]
Uhm, one little thing.

377
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,753
She's worth a lot of money,

378
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,956
so try not to rough her up
too much if you don't mind.

379
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:32,925
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Hmph.

380
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,863
Man, this is gonna
work out great.

381
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,665
Hate to break it to you,
Hachi old pal,

382
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,967
but you and Camie
are done for this time.

383
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:46,138
It's all right. You can cry.

384
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,639
I was just kidding,
you big baby.

385
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,174
I didn't think
you'd really do it.

386
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:54,680
Muhahaha!
Muhahaha!

387
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,625
Hey, Zoro.

388
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,594
I noticed the
Sunny is setting off.

389
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,496
Did we finally find
a way to Fishman Island?

390
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,132
Forget that! Check it out!
It's a real-life mermaid!

391
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,534
Her name's Camie.
Isn't she cool?

392
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,235
Nice to meet you!

393
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,970
She's a mermaid, huh?

394
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,675
[ZORO]
Never seen one before.

395
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,678
It's gone!
He erased his memory!

396
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,714
She has a friend that makes
real good octopus fritters,

397
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,083
so we're gonna save him
first so we can eat.

398
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,284
I'm kind of worried.

399
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,853
Hatchin didn't sound like
himself at all when we talked.

400
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,089
I'm afraid they've done
something awful to him.

401
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,857
[PAPPAGU]
Ehh, he's tough enough to cope.

402
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,059
I wouldn't worry 'bout it.

403
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,260
You guys, on the other hand,

404
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,494
were awful quick
to offer your help,

405
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,098
but are you positive you're
not in over your head on this?

406
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,266
You kidding?

407
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,967
[PAPPAGU] All right,
well fair warning,

408
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,203
these guys aren't the
only kidnappers in the area.

409
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,972
There's a whole bunch
of crews just like them.

410
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,874
[PAPPAGU] The Sabaody
Archipelago's a hotspot

411
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,909
for kidnapping.

412
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,612
Human trafficking is
big business around here.

413
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,781
You mean like
slave trading or something?

414
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,083
Pretty sick stuff.

415
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,918
And seeing as mermaids
fetch a high price

416
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,086
on the market,

417
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,521
a trio of fishmen that call
themselves the Macro Gang

418
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,257
have been targeting
Camie for a long time.

419
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,993
[PAPPAGU] We were stuck in that
sea monster's belly for a while.

420
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,595
Hachi probably
got worried about us

421
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,964
and figured the Macro Gang
kidnapped you or something.

422
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,265
then he went after
them to rescue you

423
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,067
and got kidnapped himself.

424
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,736
Yeah. That must be it.

425
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,841
Hachin's so kind, and he's
always looking after me.

426
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,542
This is all my fault.

427
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,815
Guy's named Hatchin, huh?

428
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,785
Reminds me of that dumbass
octopus from way back.

429
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,656
If it's that guy,
there's no way I'm helping him.

430
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,958
But what're the odds, right?

431
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,626
Usually Hachi
can take those guys,

432
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,595
or anybody else,
for that matter,

433
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,130
but with the
Flying Fish Riders involved,

434
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,764
it's a whole
different story.

435
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,000
[FRANKY]
'Kay, but who are these guys?

436
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,702
[PAPPAGU] They're another one
of those kidnapping crews

437
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:57,736
I mentioned.

438
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,872
They've really been
running the place lately.

439
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,109
Word is, once they target you,
you're as good as done for.

440
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,211
[PAPPAGU] Their boss Duval
is this scary guy

441
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,779
with an iron mask.

442
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,781
Nobody knows what
his face looks like.

443
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,284
Anyway, it seems like
they're looking for someone.

444
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,586
They've been stopping every
ship that comes by here

445
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,589
and checking out their crews,
member by member.

446
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,758
Man. They sound
like a real pain.

447
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,127
Eh, how tough
can they be? It's fine.

448
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,595
Don't worry, Camie.

449
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,731
We'll get the octopus
fritters back for sure!

450
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,999
That's fritter "salesman!"

451
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,334
I-I'm sure you're
right, Luffychin!

452
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,969
[LUFFY]
Of course I'm right!

453
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,006
Hey Brook! Why dontcha play
a song to lighten the mood?

454
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,174
Yohohohoho!

455
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,742
With pleasure, Captain!

456
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:46,818
[violin playing 'Binks' Brew']

457
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:53,926
[violin playing 'Binks' Brew']

458
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,961
[violin continues]

459
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,085
Whoa! What?

460
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,921
[USOPP] Hey, guys!
We're in trouble!

461
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,291
Did something happen?

462
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:26,959
What's the matter?

463
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,727
The fish said they're sorry,

464
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,395
but they can't
take us any further.

465
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,863
They're scared.

466
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,365
Wait, what? Someone's here?

467
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,199
Ah!

468
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,735
Look! It's the
Flying Fish Riders!

469
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,709
[LUFFY] Where?
I can't see anything!

470
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,244
Hey! Camie!

471
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,180
Where are you going?
You have to hide!

472
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,982
They're in the sky,
not the sea!

473
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,016
Look up!

474
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,896
Wow, they really can fly!

475
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,198
That's awesome!

476
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,166
They're our enemy, remember?

477
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,035
Damn it.
Attacking us head on!

478
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,672
They have seats and handlebars
and everything! Whoa!

479
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,875
Hey! It's them!

480
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,143
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Yeah! You're right!

481
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,978
Those are the Straw Hat Pirates
down there, no doubt about it!

482
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,413
Let's contact the boss!

483
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,148
[FISH RIDER 386B]
You got it!

484
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,350
[FISH RIDER 386A] I thought we'd
only make it out with a mermaid.

485
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,052
This is our lucky day!

486
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,854
[FISH RIDER 386B] Master
Duval is gonna be thrilled

487
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:29,988
when he hears this!

488
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,191
Here they come again!

489
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,406
They're dropping bombs.

490
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,740
Buncha jerks.

491
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,009
--Now, Gum-Gum...
--72 Caliber...

492
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,744
--[LUFFY] ...Pistol!
--[ZORO] ...Phoenix!

493
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,419
That was a close one!

494
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,353
They're not finished!

495
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,454
Once they're out of the water,

496
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,757
flying fish can stay in
the air up to five minutes!

497
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,125
[FISH RIDER 386B] Yep,
that's right, Master Duval,

498
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,328
there's no doubt in
my mind that it's them.

499
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,163
Huh? Wait.

500
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,265
Sorry, sir,
I missed that last part.

501
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,200
Turn around!

502
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,069
He told us to go
back to base!

503
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,437
[FISH RIDER 386A]
But that's ridiculous!

504
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,173
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Boss's orders. Who knows?

505
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,141
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Fine, but I don't get it!

506
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,785
They're gone?

507
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:34,920
[DUVAL]
Macro.

508
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,788
[MACRO]
What is it, Master Duval?

509
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,256
[DUVAL] That mermaid
you were luring here

510
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,492
is on a pirate ship right now.

511
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,194
Were you aware of that?

512
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,429
[MACRO]
Huh? Camie? No!

513
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,102
[DUVAL] The very pirate ship
I've been searching for

514
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,037
all this time.

515
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,074
All my suffering,
all my waiting,

516
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,410
will finally
come to an end.

517
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,481
[DUVAL]
I'll have my revenge!

518
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:06,418
I'll kill that bastard
that ruined my life!

519
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:23,135
[HACHI] Nyuu! Camie, run!
This is a trap!

520
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,138
[ZORO] That voice, and that
silhouette. It's gotta be him.

521
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,073
[LUFFY] Ugh!
I don't want to save him!

522
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,908
Even if octopus fritters
are at stake,

523
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,343
we can buy 'em
somewhere else!

524
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,178
You stay in that cage!

525
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,479
[HACHI]
Nyuu!

526
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,281
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

527
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,516
"The Fated Reunion!

528
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,918
Save the Captive Fishman!"

529
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
