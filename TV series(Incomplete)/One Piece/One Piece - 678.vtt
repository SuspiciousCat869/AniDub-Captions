00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.080
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:31.851
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:34.489
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:36.292
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:38.463
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:42.204
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:37.982
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.016 --> 00:02:40.955
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:43.326
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.166
as the New World.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.203
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:50.708
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:51.911
they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.814
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.186
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.423
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:02.397
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:04.803
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.944
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:12.384
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.096
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.133
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.104
intending to destroy
a Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:23.339
in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:25.578
However, plans changed
when Law was captured

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.114
by Doflamingo.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:29.385
Luffy has now snuck
into the Royal Palace

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.757
to rescue his apprehended ally.

00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:35.163
[TREBOL]
S-S-Sugar passed out!

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:02.451
[TREBOL] The slaves we've been
collecting for a whole ten years

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:05.290
are all turning back to normal!

00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:08.830
The Hobby-Hobby Fruit
powers are wearing off!

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:11.870
[LEO]
Operation SOP is a success!

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.882
Who's that cape guy?

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:19.218
Kyros, it's you!

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:20.220
Huh?

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:22.859
Originally, the toys
were human like us.

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:24.328
When they changed,
they were erased

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.499
from our memories.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:29.472
The girl who did this, Sugar,
passed out just now.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:31.643
So our memories all
came flooding back!

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.158
He's the former captain
of King Riku's Army.

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.795
Kyros!

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:42.130
It's you!

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:43.734
Kyros, my boy!

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:44.769
Sir!

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:49.913
I'm sorry to keep you waiting
these ten long years,

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:51.817
King Riku.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.791
But now, I'm here to save you!

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:58.564
[KYROS yells]

00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:03.674
We shall reclaim this kingdom!

00:05:03.707 --> 00:05:05.143

Ten years!

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:32.699
For ten long years,
we've suffered!

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.101
[DOLDO]
Hmm.

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:35.572
[BABY 5 yells]

00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:36.973
Doflamingo!

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:40.614
Young Master! You bastard!

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.259
Today!

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.900
The people will see you
for what you are!

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.704
Mingo just died!

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:52.939
Well, that sucks!

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:54.474
I was gonna be the one
to kick his ass!

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.778
--[PIRATE D] There they are!
--[PIRATE E] I see 'em!

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.247
--[PIRATE F] Get them!

[VIOLET gasps]

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:00.955
We gotta go save Traffy!

00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:02.123
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:08.136
I can't believe it!

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.040
How can this be?

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:12.043
If I'm not mistaken,
all the toys here

00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:15.417
in the coliseum have suddenly
turned into humans!

00:06:15.451 --> 00:06:17.822
I don't even know
how to explain this!

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:19.291
It's inconceivable!

00:06:19.324 --> 00:06:21.262
[GORILLA grunting]

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:26.338
Where the hell'd this
gorilla come from?!

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:27.440
Run!

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:32.117
[DIAMANTE]
I can't believe this.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.225
Trebol left Sugar unguarded.

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:37.528
That moron!

00:06:37.561 --> 00:06:39.498
Ain't that something else, huh?

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.804
Hey. I'm not your babysitter.

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:43.641
Stop your bawling.

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:44.909
[REBECCA]
It's not like that!

00:06:50.253 --> 00:06:51.623
It all came back to me.

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:58.771
Mother! Look at all
the flowers I found!

00:06:58.804 --> 00:07:00.473
[SCARLET]
There's so many of them!

00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.210
I picked this one just for you!

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:04.882
It's beautiful!
Thank you, Rebecca!

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:07.521
And this is from
your mother to you!

00:07:10.895 --> 00:07:13.199

Would you like to have one?

[REBECCA crying]

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.400
I say we dig in!

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.203
That sounds like a great idea.

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.190
[REBECCA, KYROS laugh]

00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:45.531

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:50.273

Okay, Daddy.

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.830
[KYROS] If it gets too
dangerous here, leave.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:04.569
Wait for me in the
Red Flower Field.

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:06.639

It's been so long.

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:38.302
I had... I had a father!

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:42.077
Huh?
What are you blathering about?

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:45.016
[SABO]
Now that the smoke is clear,

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.153
it's time we uncover the truth,
right, Rebecca?

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:56.071
[SABO] There's a core
at the heart of all things.

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:57.976
And once you find that...

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:02.117
Anything, great or small,
can be undone.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.152
[BARTOLOMEO]
You lost me.

00:09:03.185 --> 00:09:04.856
You sound cool as hell
and I still look up

to you, of course!
But, uh, you lost me!

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:12.370
[SABO] Even the ring we
stand in now has a core.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.882
Think it's about time
we wrap this up.

[GYATS]
Huh?!

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:36.854
The ring is splitting apart!

That was a single
blow from Lucy!

[HACK] What's all that
commotion up there?

00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:35.237
Hey, Hack.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.307
[HACK] Did he do something
reckless again?

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:39.946
[KOALA laughs]
He's heading underground now.

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.891
[GYATS] The ring has
completely capsized.

00:10:45.924 --> 00:10:49.497
But somehow, the water
level is plunging with it?

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:51.536
We can no longer
guarantee the safety

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:53.172
of our guests!

00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:56.211
Everyone! Please evacuate
the coliseum at once!

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:01.021
It's pulling us to the center.

Oh, no!
How is this happening?

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:04.862
Could all the water
be draining out?

00:11:04.896 --> 00:11:06.667
There must be cracks
in the foundation!

Nice try!

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:52.925
I'm slipping!

actually planning on giving

You're all out of bounds!

00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:22.450

I know it seems trivial
at the moment.

But in the thick of the chaos,
our top dog has finally emerged!

in the competition

has climbed to the top.

can help me out too?

Brace yourself.

supposed to be mine!

It's really working!

Oh! I guess that's my cue!

[SABO] Wait, it's not
that hot, actually!

00:14:56.993 --> 00:14:58.530
[CROWD yells]

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.832
Damn you, Straw Hats!
Who do you think you are, huh?

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:34.635
That was cruel!

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:38.610
What kind of monster
would knock Sugar out?

00:15:38.644 --> 00:15:39.846
Tontattas!

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.083
How dare you put them
up to this and free

00:15:42.116 --> 00:15:43.620
our servants!

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:48.262
I won't let any of you leave
here alive, do you hear me?

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:50.667
Usoland!

00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:54.240
Are you doing okay?

00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:59.652
Guys! Take Usopp and run!

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:01.021
Sure, Robiland!

00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:02.090
Let's go, then!

00:16:02.124 --> 00:16:04.929
Don't let him lay a goopy
finger on Usoland!

00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:08.135
[DWARVES yelling]

00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:10.140
Let me take a wild guess.

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:12.444
You wanna trash the factory?

00:16:12.477 --> 00:16:15.482
Sound about right, Nico Robin?

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.823
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:25.804
[HAJRUDIN]
Hold it!

00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:33.452
[ROBIN]
A Giant?

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.339
[DWARVES yelling]

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:45.511
You're "Little People," huh?

00:16:45.544 --> 00:16:48.282
Mind if I borrow this
guy for a second?

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.325
[LEO]
Usoland!

00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:06.351
He must have fought
real hard to save us

00:17:06.385 --> 00:17:09.190
if he's in this condition.

00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:11.529
Everyone, look!

00:17:16.305 --> 00:17:20.681
I heard that some of you,
for a decade,

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:23.520
have been living as slaves.

00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:25.422
It must have been hard.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:36.612
You have... suffered enough...

00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:41.923
If it weren't for you,

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:43.794
we would have lived out
the rest of our days

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:45.564
as toys.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:48.435
Enslaved in this
hellish nightmare.

00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:52.476
But you allowed us
to reclaim our identities.

00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:54.982
Gaze your eyes
upon this man.

00:17:58.422 --> 00:18:01.227
Remember this face well.

00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.868
As the hero who
shattered our curse!

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:10.079
I... I...

00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:14.053
I am move-- so much...

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:21.101
His name.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.817
Captain Usopp!

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.188
[TOYS cheer]

00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:34.027
Captain Usopp!

00:18:34.061 --> 00:18:36.197
[cheering continues]

00:18:42.677 --> 00:18:45.049
We thank you!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.286
[cheering]

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:58.475
Our hero!

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.780
[cheering]

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.472
What fell?

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:15.242
Did the ceiling topple?

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:29.839
He looks Godly!

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.776
That aura! My God!

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:33.078
Don't tell me!

00:19:33.112 --> 00:19:35.249
We've been saved
by a real deity!

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:53.753
Then that means we're...
witnessing a miracle!

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:08.917
So saintly!

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.754
So holy!

00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:20.974
Hey look! Everyone!

00:20:21.007 --> 00:20:23.546
I think God Usopp is trying
to say something!

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:32.330
You people will...

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:40.748
be guided... by m-me.

00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:41.683
You people will...
be guided... by m-me.

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:43.786
Huh? Wait!
What did he just tell us?

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:56.946
Y-You people...

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:00.119
...will be...

00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:05.362
...guided by me.

00:21:10.908 --> 00:21:14.347
[TOY MAN J] "You people
will be guided by me"?

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.854

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:26.772
...sent down from Heaven!

00:21:28.042 --> 00:21:30.613
We humbly bow down
to you, great savior!

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:33.352
[TOYS]
Yeah!

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.559

00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:50.987
[chanting continues]

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.231
We will follow
your command, God Usopp!

00:21:56.264 --> 00:21:58.670
Anything!
Just tell us what to do!

00:21:58.703 --> 00:21:59.705
[TOY MAN P]
That's right!

00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:01.174
[TOY MAN Q]
You've sacrificed enough!

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:03.044
Now allow us to repay you!

00:22:03.078 --> 00:22:05.082
[TOY MAN R] We wanna be

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.484
How can we atone?

00:22:07.888 --> 00:22:09.157
[TOY MAN S]
Please, guide us!

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.562
Show us the way,
Mighty God Usopp!

00:22:11.595 --> 00:22:13.198
What must we do?

00:22:21.482 --> 00:22:24.788
Well, uh, in that case...

00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:28.128
Why don't you all destroy
the factory behind me

00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:30.399
and rescue our little friends?

00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:39.852
[ABDULLAH laughs]

00:22:39.886 --> 00:22:41.823
Gladly, "Great One"!

00:22:56.285 --> 00:22:57.554
[chanting continues]

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.441
The hell is wrong
with these people?

00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:16.892
[NARRATOR]
The Fire Fist finally returns!

00:23:16.925 --> 00:23:19.464
The mysterious competitor
"Lucy" claims victory

00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:21.536
in the coliseum and
acquires the late Ace's

00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:22.771
Flame-Flame fruit.

00:23:22.804 --> 00:23:24.642
As he reveals his true identity,

00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:26.846
a fresh chapter
begins in the tale of

00:23:26.879 --> 00:23:28.448
