00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,484
If you wanna go, go.

175
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,152
We can't go that way.

176
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,254
And exactly why not?!

177
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,089
[SUBORDINATE 1] Mr. Bon Clay,
we need to set sail

178
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,158
while we still can!
There's no more time, sir!

179
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,260
[NAMI]
Noon at the eastern harbor.

180
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,062
We've got an appointment.

181
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,497
There's no time to go around.

182
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,098
We'll go straight through.

183
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,601
What?! Suicide! It's ludicrous!

184
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,336
Is there some treasure
you're not telling me about

185
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,338
that's worth throwing
away your lives?

186
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,573
Fine! Run off and die!

187
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,708
We have to go get
one of our friends.

188
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,009
[MR. 2 gasps]

189
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,188
[MR. 2] So, it's for your
pal that you risk it all.

190
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:14,727
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,266
[COBRA]
Vivi, I'm coming in, okay?

192
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,401
[VIVI]
Sure, the door's open.

193
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,637
[COBRA] Sweetie, what did
you want to talk‐‐

194
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,705
[gasps]

195
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,408
Vivi, amazing.

196
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,577
[IGARAM] I mistook you
for the queen in her youth.

197
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,280
Uncanny resemblance
and just as beautiful.

198
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,315
[COBRA]
A vision of elegance.

199
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,583
[VIVI]
Have a seat, Daddy.

200
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,321
No. Father. Igaram.

201
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,294
I have an important
matter to discuss.

202
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,932
Great Bon Clay!

203
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,036
[MR. 2] Running now
would go against everything

204
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,071
Bon Clay stands for.

205
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,507
If we abandon allies
who are risking their lives

206
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,444
to pick up a friend, could we
live with ourselves tomorrow?

207
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,048
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

208
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,851
[MR. 2]
Listen, guys. Straw Hats, too!

209
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,523
What I must say is
of great importance!

210
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:25,965
[MARINE A]
Miss Hina!

211
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,900
The enemy ships
are splitting up!

212
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,268
The duck ship is headed south!

213
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,571
[HINA] The duck is
probably meant as a decoy.

214
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,640
Well... Actually, it appears
the entire Straw Hat crew

215
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,943
is onboard the
duck ship, Captain!

216
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,211
[MARINE B] It's the sheep ship
they're using as the decoy!

217
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,549
[HINA]
Follow the duck!

218
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,251
Return to formation immediately!

[bell ringing]

220
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,333
Three minutes!

224
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,243
[LUFFY]
So, tell me something.

225
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,647
I am the Straw Hat you idiots
are looking for, right?

226
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,483
[MR. 2]
Or am I?

227
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,417
[MARINE A]
Miss Hina!

228
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,252

[MR. 2 laughing]

231
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,927
[MR. 2] You must be feeling
pretty stupid right now,

232
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,328
falling for such a simple trick!

233
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,098
See, we're masters of disguise!

234
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,969
As well as friends
to the Straw Hats!

[MR. 2] Even if I stray
from my code as a man.

Even if I stray from
my code as a woman.

my basic humanity!

That is the
difference between us!

If my brethren
and I are to fall,

241
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,994
we will fall together,

and watching it bloom!

let it be in the sea.

The flower of
friendship is rejoicing.

256
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,333
[VIVI] We don't know
who the ringleader is?

257
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,136
Right. It's an
underground organization.

258
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,171
Even its members
know absolutely nothing

259
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,173
about the identity
of their boss.

260
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,742
[VIVI] So, this country's
enemy has no name.

261
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,811
[IGARAM] It's impossible
for us to gather information

on them from the outside.

263
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,516
Further investigation might
put the country at risk.

Isn't that correct?

Yes.

to be honest with me!

Then, Vivi...

Let me ask you
just one question.

287
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,888
[VIVI]
It all started on that day.

288
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,824
[IGARAM] Are you prepared
to live at all cost?

289
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,662
[VIVI]
I went on a little adventure.

[NANOHANA C]
Oh, it's so exciting!

293
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,406
[RAINBASE A] The ceremony in
Alubarna has finally started!

294
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,208
[RAINBASE B]
It was delayed by two hours.

295
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,276
What happened?

296
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,180
Ah, well.

297
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,515
I can only hope it won't
cause a commotion.

298
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,951
Come and listen, Koza.
Hey, come on.

299
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,220
Vivi's speech has
already started.

300
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,955
The amplifiers are
cranked all the way up.

301
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,691
I could be underground
and still hear every word.

302
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,263
[VIVI]
A journey...

303
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,731
...to cross the dark sea.

304
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,300
But, what I found was
a grand adventure.

305
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,303
The sheer vastness of the
ocean was overwhelming.

306
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,372
And yet, it brought me
to a series of islands

307
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,242
so unbelievable
they defied imagination.

308
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,747
With such wondrous environments,
inhabited by strange creatures.

309
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,583
At times, the melody
of the waves was quiet,

310
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,719
swaying gently,
as if easing my soul.

311
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,488
And there were other times

312
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,990
when the melody was
violently laughing at me,

313
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,960
as if threatening to rip
my very heart in two.

314
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,399
[VIVI]
In that dark, dark storm.

315
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,735
I encountered a single,
small ship.

316
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,272
The ship spoke to me,
while pushing me onward.

317
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,975
It said with a clear,
singular voice,

318
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,311
"Can't you see the light?"

319
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,414
This wondrous ship,
which never strayed off course,

320
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,783
even through
pitch‐black darkness,

321
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,320
danced its way across
the huge waves.

322
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,756
The mighty ship kept its
stem pointed straight ahead,

323
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,593
thwarting every obstacle
the ocean could throw at it.

324
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,364
Finally, as the ship roused
my spirits, it said,

325
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,933
"Look! There is a light!"

326
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,469
History will one day
catalog this experience

327
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,603
as an illusion.

328
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,841
But, I will always remember
it as a singular truth.

329
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,843
What's she talking about?

330
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,347
The secret battle she fought
against that group of criminals.

331
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,848
[VIVI]
And...

332
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,254
Vivi.

333
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,390
Forget about it.
You heard the speech.

334
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,492
That was Vivi's voice
without a doubt.

335
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,260
They're just
broadcasting the ceremony

336
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,329
that's being held in Alubarna.

337
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,065
Vivi's already made up
her mind not to come here.

338
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,936
No. I don't buy it.
I say she's here.

339
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,171
This is the Tamarisk
place, right?

340
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,173
[ZORO]
Yeah. That's it.

341
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,975
[SANJI]
Let's go. It's past noon.

342
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,477
[LUFFY] There's no way
she wouldn't have come!

343
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,178
She's definitely here!

344

Where's the real Vivi?

358
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,145
[SPECTATOR C]
We heard her voice!

359
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,647
So, where the hell is the
princess speaking from?

360
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,650
At least Vivi is safe.

Thank you so much

Who's the princess talking to?

No way! I think I just
spotted Princess Vivi!

00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,380
She's supposed to be at
the ceremony in Alubarna.

381
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,117
I'd like to go on
more adventures.

the needs of my country,

about Vivi and us.
