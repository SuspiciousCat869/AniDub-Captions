00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,589
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,326
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,894
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,897
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,432
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,235
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,903
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,839
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,709
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,345
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,879
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,315
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,719
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,822
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,259
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:16,997
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,702
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,004
Luffy struggled in vain
to rescue his brother Ace

19
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,640
from execution at
the hands of the Navy.

20
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,707
In the end,

21
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,278
both Ace and the legendary
pirate Whitebeard,

22
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,981
lost their lives
in the conflict

23
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,449
marking the end of the war.

24
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,952
[siren]

25
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,633
[MARINE AA] A pirate ship
is approaching Lascamp

26
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,800
in the West Blue!

27
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,202
But we don't have any
forces nearby that can help!

28
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,571
Contact the closest base!

29
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,008
Reinforcements from the 80th
division are on their way!

30
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,012
[MARINE BB]
This is the South Blue!

31
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,113
Currently checking
the location of the attack!

32
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,148
[MARINE B]
Damn it!

33
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,983
The pirates are supposed
to be afraid of us!

34
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,818
Headquarters dealt them
a major blow at Marineford,

35
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,654
not to mention Whitebeard
is dead, so what gives?

36
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,623
You would've thought they'd
be laying low after the war,

37
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,525
but they're running
wild everywhere!

38
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,127
I wonder what's
gotten into those guys?

39
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,429
[RADIO VOICE] Pirates have
started raiding Lascamp!

40
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,399
Communication
has also been lost!

41
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,699
Proceed to send backup!

42
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,500
I repeat!

43
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,369
Send backup now!

44
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,873
All right boys, load her up!

45
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,342
After that it's on
to the Grand Line!

46
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,343
[cheers]

47
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,116
[NARRATOR] Two weeks after
the War of the Best concluded,

48
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,618
the world began to witness

49
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,554
the consequences
of Whitebeard's defeat.

50
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,027
[MAN screams]
You guys aren't welcome here!

51
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,729
Get out of our town!

52
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,569
[BROWNBEARD PIRATE]
You didn't hear the news?

53
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,041
Then lemme tell you,

54
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,411
this dump's been up for grabs
since Whitebeard croaked.

55
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,813
This stupid flag
don't mean a thing now!

56
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,648
That's right.

57
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,318
There's no one
to protect you now!

58
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,799
[BROWNBEARD chuckles]

59
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,100
Huh?

60
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,770
Hey, twerp!

61
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,772
Listen up, cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

62
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,275
This island's under
my control now!

63
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,545
The name's Brownbeard
and don't you forget it!

64
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,048
[BROWNBEARD laughs]

65
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,351
[NARRATOR] The war ended
with the death of Whitebeard

66
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,119
and a Navy victory.

67
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,922
Yet the peace that the World
Government hoped to achieve

68
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,057
slipped through their
fingers and the world

69
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,060
was only plunged
into further unrest.

70
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,833
Meanwhile, aboard the
Kuja ship Boa Hancock, Jimbei,

71
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,437
and the Heart pirates make
their way toward Amazon Lily

72
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,573
where they will shelter
the unconscious Luffy.

73
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,078
Big Sis!

74
00:06:51,112 --> 00:06:52,279
[MARIGOLD]
Big Sis!

75
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,548
[AMAZONS]
Snake Princess!

76
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,117
Thank you for the warm greeting.

77
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,251
I am so pleased to see

78
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,687
you're all in good health
my faithful warriors.

79
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,557
Forgive me
if I've caused you concern.

80
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,527
No matter what trial you faced,
we knew you'd triumph.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,496
In any case, we're happy
to have our princess back.

82
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,633
[IVANKOV]
Now then.

83
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,469
This chapter of Straw Boy's
life, costarring yours truly,

84
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,104
has come to a close.

85
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,605
Heehaw!

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,040
Jimbei, I hope you don't mind

87
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:22,576
watching over our
friend in my place.

88
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,510
Of course.

89
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,579
My body is still
too weak to swim,

90
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,847
but the least that I can do

91
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:30,216
is watch over Luffy
until he recovers.

92
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,055
Though, I fear there is precious
little aid I can give him.

93
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,058
It was a curious twist of
fate to meet you, fishman.

94
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:38,959
Likewise.

95
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,060
Although we were both imprisoned

96
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,262
in the lowest levels
of Impel Down,

97
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,765
our paths nearly didn't cross.

98
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,434
Luffy carried us away
like a tidal wave.

99
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,468
Though I must admit,

100
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:51,772
I know not the direction
that these seas flow.

101
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,773
[IVANKOV]
Tidal wave is right.

102
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:58,946
His antics at Marineford were
too turbulent even for us.

103
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,082
I hate to say goodbye,
my friend,

104
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:03,050
but the candy boys
and girls of my kingdom

105
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,186
can only wait on
their master for so long!

106
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,455
Do take good care
of Straw Boy for me!

107
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,156
I shall miss him!

108
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:17,597
So long! Bye! Thanks
for everything, Straw Hat!

109
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,200
We'll tell tales of you in
Kamabakka Kingdom

110
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,535
for years to come!

111
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,104
When he wakes up,
be sure to say "hi" for us!

112
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,839
[IVANKOV]
Get well soon, Straw Boy!

113
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,407
We can't wait to see you again!

114
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,609
[BUNNY QUEER]
Hang in there!

115
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,812
[CHAUFFEUR QUEER]
Everything's gonna be okay!

116
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,847
Let's go, my darlings!

117
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,517
Yeah! Off to the
New Kama paradise!

118
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,753
Keep leading the way, Queen Iva!

119
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:39,553
Yessir!

120
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,522
Peachy Island, here we come!

121
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,924
I hate to ruin the moment,

122
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,426
but we really should
be on our way now.

123
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,630
[NARRATOR] And so the
pirate ship carrying Luffy

124
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,532
arrived at the Maiden Island,

[PIRATE AA]
This place is filled with women!

00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:20,160
[PIRATE BB] So it's true,
only ladies live on Amazon Lily!

136
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,962
Those heathens must
have snuck onto the ship

00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,530
to hurt the princess!

138
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,264

between life and death!

Allowing Luffy in is fine.

But we cannyot let the
other men on that ship

to our island's policy

There is a doctor
on board that ship.

Only he needs permission.

00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,685
[LAW] If Luffy's wound
opens up, he will die.

179
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,554
But don't let my words stop you.

180
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,122
If it's no big deal, take him.

181
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,723
[gasps]
Luffy will die?

182
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,159
But I would wither away
without him. I must--

183
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,394
No, we must do
everything we can!

184
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,929
[JIMBEI]
There's nothing to discuss.

185
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,731
It's obvious that
we cannot save Luffy

186
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,733
without the help of this man.

187
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,069
If Captain Law isn't
allowed on the island,

188
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,371
then we will have to take
him somewhere else.

189
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,439
[HANCOCK]
But that's ludicrous!

190
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,042
We would all be
devoured by Sea Kings!

191
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,911
And even if we
managed to repel them,

192
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,647
the Navy would soon find us.

193
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,881
Luffy.

194
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:22,482
How can I save you?

195
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:23,684
[NYON]
Very well.

196
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:27,655
I suppose we will
make another exception.

197
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,724
You may stay in
the bay of Amazon Lily.

198
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,659
Never fear.

199
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,661
The Sea Kings
won't attack you there.

200
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,929
In that case,

201
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,132
I will remain in the bay too,
so I can look after Luffy!

202
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,200
[NYON]
You will nyot!

203
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,768
[HANCOCK]
Curse you, Granny Nyon!

204
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,505
You can't say "nyo"
to everything!

205
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,439
[AMAZON CC]
Luffy!

206
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,008
Hope you get better soon!

207
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,744
The princess is lacking
her usual composure.

208
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,413
Luffy must be in
a desperate condition

209
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,815
for her to react like this.

210
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,182
Luffy.

211
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,986
[NARRATOR]
Two weeks have passed.

212
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,456
Law and his crew are staying
in the bay, continuing to treat

213
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,292
Luffy's injuries without
encroaching on the island.

214
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,094
[SHACHI sighs]
How much longer

215
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,430
do we have to stay bunched
together in this tiny space?

216
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,365
[PENGUIN]
Yeah, there's only one thing

217
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,101
to look forward to every day.

218
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,736
[MARGARET]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

219
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,271
Your provisions have arrived.

220
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,406
[HEART PIRATES]
Finally!

221
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,407
[MARGARET, SWEETPEA]
Here you go!

222
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,641
[PIRATE CC]
I've got cabin fever,

223
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:23,678
but at least the
food is amazing!

224
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,378
[PIRATE DD]
Yeah!

225
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,579
I hope you like it!

226
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,047
Oh, thank you miss.

227
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,982
Please, no pushing
or shoving, boys

228
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,118
and wait for your turn, okay?

229
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,220
[KIKYO]
Aphelandra!

230
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,756
I've told you before not
to speak to the men!

231
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,592
We're ordered to make an
exception for Luffy alone.

232
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:41,128
So, do not speak
to anyone else!

233
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,429
Fine.

234
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,931
Relax, it's not like we're
gonna do you any harm!

235
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,433
It's not that big a deal!

236
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,667
[crunching sound]

237
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,807
Do not force me
to repeat myself.

238
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,142
[HEART PIRATES]
We're sorry!

239
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,248
[MARGARET]
Excuse me.

240
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,650
Has Luffy regained
consciousness yet?

241
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,920
Still nothing.

242
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:10,056
[LAW] At this point, it's all
up to Straw Hat's spirit.

243
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,560
And whether
he wants to live or die.

244
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,194
It's his choice alone.

245
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:16,129
[KIKYO]
Margaret! Hurry it up!

246
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,364
I'm on my way!

247
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:20,467
Please. Take good care
of Luffy until he gets well!

248
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,102
Unbelievable!

249
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,105
You're chatting
with that doctor again?

250
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,672
Show some self respect!

251
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,107
[MARGARET]
I'm sorry!

252
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,522
Oh, Sis.

253
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,663
[HANCOCK]
Oh, Luffy.

254
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,470
[ACE]
Ever since you were little,

255
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,638
you've never listened
to a word I said.

256
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,441
Have you?

257
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,876
Then you run off and
do something crazy.

258
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,879
Like old times.

259
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,479
Huh, Luffy?

260
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:17,023
Don't do it. Don't do it!

261
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,864
[SHACHI]
Straw Hat, calm down!

262
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,032
[PENGUIN]
He's gonna destroy the ship!

263
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,875
Where's Ace?

264
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,355
Something is wrong.

265
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,196
[LUFFY]
Ace.

266
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,899
Ace.

267
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:06,306
Where's my brother?!

268
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:39,506
[PIRATE EE] Someone grab him!
He's lost his mind!

269
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,510
What will happen to him
if he remains in that state?

270
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:43,611
Simple.

271
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,446
If he keeps flailing around,

272
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,248
the more likely he
is to open his wound,

273
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,384
and if that happens,
chances are he'll die.

274
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,723
[PIRATE FF]
Quick! Now's our chance!

275
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,258
[LUFFY]
Damn it, get off me!

276
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,360
[PIRATE GG]
Just hold still!

277
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:01,095
[LUFFY]
Shut up!

278
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,064
I have to get to my brother!

279
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:04,431
[PIRATE HH]
Listen to me! Fire Fist is--

280
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,267
[LUFFY] I'm sick of
this crap! Let me go!

281
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,803
[screams]

282
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,171
Where did they take you?

283
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,540
Where'd you go?

284
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,809
[AMAZON C]
He's gone completely mad!

285
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,144
Oh, Luffy.

286
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,847
We've got to tell
the Snake Princess!

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,714
[AMAZON 491E]
Princess!

288
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,182
We have big news!

289
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,884
Are you there?

290
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,453
[AMAZON 491E]
Luffy has finally woken up!

291
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,554
Luffy is awake?

292
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,288
Are you sure?

293
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,757
Oh, thank goodness.

294
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,059
I must rush to
his side immediately.

295
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,060
[NYON]
You cannyot!

296
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,697
The kingdom is obsessed
with seeing those men.

297
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,966
How can you expect
them to follow our laws

298
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,768
if you so readily break
them yourself?

299
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,505
Men are prohibited in our land.

300
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:47,407
Luffy is one thing,
but I cringe at how easily

301
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,676
we let these
strangers into the bay!

302
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,746
Must you keep bending the rules?

303
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,514
Yes, I know, but he needs help.

304
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,984
Before worrying about that,
you should eat something.

305
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,285
Your sister's right!

306
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,020
Since you returned
to Amazon Lily,

307
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,022
you've barely eaten a bite!

308
00:17:02,056 --> 00:17:03,056
Food! Yes!

309
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,225
Luffy must be starving
after his recovery!

310
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,393
He will need his strength!

311
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,929
Go prepare a mountain
of dishes rich in nutrients!

312
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,464
Yes! As you wish!

313
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,166
And I shall aid you, myself.

314
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,700
Onward to the kitchen!

315
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,901
For Luffy!

316
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,671
[AMAZONS]
Whatever you want, Princess!

317
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,572
I can let this one pass.

318
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,741
So she wants to do some cooking.

319
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,109
Nyo harm in that.

320
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:22,977
When we're done,

321
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,912
I'll serve him myself!

322
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:27,014
Are you even listening?

323
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,249
When he gets well,

324
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:31,752
we'll invite Luffy
to these chambers alone.

325
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,988
Show some self restraint!

326
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,155
[HANCOCK]
What nonsense!

327
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,256
I am an empress!

328
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,691
You can't tell me what to do!

329
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,026
[NYON]
Nyo means nyo!

330
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,829
The well being of this country
does not revolve around you!

331
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,164
You poor girl!

332
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,567
You've been stricken by the
most vile illness imaginable.

333
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,771
To think that our fearsome
pirate empress is lovesick,

334
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,272
of all things!

335
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,241
Luffy must have gone
through hell and back

336
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,844
surviving both Impel Down

337
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:00,213
and the terrible things that
happened at Navy Headquarters.

338
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,183
Despite my protests,
the fact that he made it back

339
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,386
here alive is nyothing
short of a miracle.

340
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,624
I can't help but wonder
what the gods expect of him.

341
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,193
[PIRATE II]
Yo pass me the wrench.

342
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,995
[PIRATE JJ]
'Kay, here ya go.

343
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,865
Hey! How're the ship
repairs coming along?

344
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,767
We'll manage don't you worry.

345
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,002
The rest of you ever figure out
where Straw Hat went?

346
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,838
Jimbei's been gone
for a while now, too.

347
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,207
Nope. Ain't got a clue.

348
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,244
[PENGUIN] Someone told me that
if a man enters Amazon Lily,

349
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,746
he'll be turned to
stone right on the spot.

350
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,182
I'm starting to think it's
worth dying for, though.

351
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:36,784
[SHACHI]
According to Aphelandra,

352
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,218
there're tons of girls.

353
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,720
Way more than what
we saw at the port.

354
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:42,489
This is a one time chance.

355
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,526
If I don't peek, I might regret
it for the rest of my life!

356
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,661
I guess we'll both
be statues, then, huh?

357
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,763
Do you think
they've got girl bears?

358
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,532
You're ruining our fantasy!

359
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:52,833
[BEPO]
Sorry I asked.

360
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,668
Amazon women are humans!

361
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,969
No bears for you!

362
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,771
[BEPO]
Life is cruel!

363
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:42,850
What is this place?

364
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,986
Where am I?

365
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,354
Maybe.

366
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,522
I dreamt the whole thing.

367
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:03,937
[screams]

368
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,140
Sorry, Luffy.

369
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,541
I tried.

370
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:15,749
[ACE] Looks like this
is as far as I can go.

371
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,360
[LUFFY]
It's not true!

372
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,261
It can't be!

373
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,663
[ACE]
Luffy!

374
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,800
Go away!

375
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,375
[LUFFY]
Stop it!

376
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,944
It's not true!

377
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:49,749
[roars]

378
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,383
[ACE]
Jimbei.

379
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:26,454
I know I might not
make it out of this alive.

380
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,488
I'm sorry, but if I die,

381
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,790
would you look after
my brother for me?

382
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,996
You must listen to me, Luffy!

383
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,698
Your brother Ace is--

384
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,832
[LUFFY]
Don't say it!

385
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,401
Don't say anything!

386
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,571
You think I don't know?

387
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,808
You think I think
this is a dream?

388
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:54,982
[LUFFY] If it were a dream,
I'd already be awake!

389
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:58,051
But it's not, is it?

390
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:09,496
My brother Ace is
really dead, isn't he?

391
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:19,306
[JIMBEI]
Yes, I'm afraid that he is.

392
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:27,381
[LUFFY sobs]

393
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,683
[LUFFY]
Hey, Grandpa!

394
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,718
Who's this Ace fella?

395
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:34,087
[GARP]
Well, funny you should ask...

396
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:37,290
...'cause Ace is gonna
be your new big brother!

397
00:22:39,226 --> 00:22:44,331
[ACE] Luffy, when next we meet,
we'll both be top pirates!

398
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,266
The top.

399
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,000
You and me!

400
00:22:51,138 --> 00:23:01,147
[screams]

401
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,386
[LUFFY]
Ace!

402
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,128
[NARRATOR] Distraught
over the Ace's death,

403
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,198
Luffy recalls events
from ten years ago

404
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,066
when the two first met.

405
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,301
Before they were
brothers or even friends,

406
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:22,502
the boys lived in the mountains,

407
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,172
dreaming of the days when
they would take to the sea.

408
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:29,009
This is a tale of childhood,
of brotherhood, and of tragedy.

409
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,578
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

410
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:34,548
"Luffy and Ace! The Story
of How the Brothers Met!"

411
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,485
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
