Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

Make some waves...

21

All the way to "One piece"!!

And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,312
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,414
of the World Government,
which will use

48
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:05,552
any means necessary
to stop them.

49
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,687
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,090
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,598

the Grand Line to the New World!

from the Sabaody Archipelago

54

by the Warlord of the Sea
known as Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,451
I have my Vivre Card! Of course!

56
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,787
All right! Good thing
everyone got one, huh?

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,789
We'll be back
together in no time.

58
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,792
[NARRATOR] Alone and lost
on a strange island,

59
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,360

his Vivre Card to
reunite with his crew

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,498
until curiosity got
the better of him.

62
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,736
[LUFFY] Hey, aren't
these Laughing Mushrooms?

63
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,672
[MARGARET]
Hurry! I can see the smoke.

64
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,441
It's right over there!

65
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,144
Rather puzzling, isn't it?

66
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,581
[NARRATOR] After eating
a parasitic mushroom,

67
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,484
Luffy passed out and was
carried to a nearby village

68
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,387
by a group of
mysterious women.

69
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,222
Hold on! What is this?

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,123
Is something wrong?

71
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,524
[SWEETPEA]
There's one between her legs

72
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,828
that we failed to catch.
How careless of us.

73
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,563
Huh. You're right,

74
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,299
but this one seems different
than the others, doesn't it?

75
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,434
It has such a strange shape.

76
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,903
It appears to be some
sort of sack mushroom!

77
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,739
[NYON]
Nyo my! What is this?

78
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,307
Is something wrong?

[MARGARET]
Oh, hello Granny Nyon!

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,610
There's a mushroom
growing on this girl

81
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,480
that won't come off,
no matter how hard we try!

82
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,551
Oh nyo!

A man!

86

I've never seen a man before.

87
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,369

[NARRATOR] This is the
all-female land of Amazon Lily

91
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,586
where men dare not tread.

92
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,689
On occasion, the
women who live here

93
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,525
will leave the island
and return with child,

94
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:30,563
but oddly enough, they only
seem to give birth to girls.

95
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,732
Here, a thick jungle
surrounds a mountain

96
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,901
that stretches
towards the sky.

97
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,836
Nestled inside
its rocky exterior

98
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:42,275
is a fortress-like village
that houses the entire nation.

I couldn't resist.
I bought a matching pair!

102
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,528

they are as brave and
adventurous as any man,

but have an undeniable
grace about them.

117
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,849
Their seclusion has also
given them an air of innocence.

118
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:01,587
Here in this paradise,
there is no need for men at all.

119

any man foolish enough
to gaze upon these warriors

133

It's so flat!

Awfully chiseled-looking,
isn't he?

Rather underwhelming, I'd say.

And his hair's so shaggy.

[AMAZON GLASSES]
What is it that men eat, anyway?

00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,942
Just raw meat?

this one will eat anything.

00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,686
Anybody know
where my stuff went?

177
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:47,820
[AMAZON]
Men are slow-witted.

178
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,455
And they cover
their heads first,

179
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,325
even if their
bodies are exposed.

180
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:01,701
[MARGARET] Uhm, pardon me
for asking, but, uh...

181
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,669
Before you get dressed,
could you please tell us

182
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,373
what's in that little bag that's
in between your legs there?

183
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,674
[LUFFY]
Bag?

184
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,611
Come on, you don't
know what those are?

185
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,647
[LUFFY]
What a weirdo!

186
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,016
These are my family jewels.

187
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,452
[AMAZON]
They're jewels?

188
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,620
Jewels, huh?

189
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,787
Family jewels.

190
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,122
How fascinating!

191
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,123
[SWEETPEA]
Bizarre.

192
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,524
Interesting.

193
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,993
A bag of jewels!

194
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,795
[AMAZON 409N] I can't see
them! Scoot over, Margaret!

195
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,763
[MARGARET]
Oh, sorry!

196
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,398
[AMAZON 409O]
Your notebook's in the way!

197
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,532
[NERINE]
Oops.

198
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,868
So, what are these jewels?

199
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,103
It's my treasure!

200
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,639
That's why I always
gotta keep 'em safe!

201
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,542
[AMAZONS gasp and yell]

202
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,610
Treasure?

203
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,513
To think that men have
such an incredible secret.

204
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,448
[AMAZONS]
Family jewels!

205
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,084
I wish I had some too!

206
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,819
Then could you please
take them out?

207
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,721
We'd just like
to hold them for a second.

208
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,823
Are you nuts? You'll kill me!

209
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,759
Not a chance!

210
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,727
Might as well
get dressed, then!

211
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,629
Your clothes were all
torn when we found you,

212
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,865
so I made some new ones
that are just like them.

213
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,434
Wow. Hey, thanks a lot!

214
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,869
That was real nice.

215
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,704
And we don't even
know each other!

216
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,040
I made a few
improvements as well.

217
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,944
[LUFFY whimpering]

218
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,724
So flowery.

219
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,827
The vest says "I'm serious"
but the frills say "I'm cute!"

220
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,596
His enemies will shake
with fear and jealousy alike!

221
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,898
You're a genius, Margaret!

222
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,034
Aw, look, he's so
happy, he's shaking!

223
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,205
He's thanking you
on his hands and knees!

[LUFFY yelling]

225
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,984
What the hell is
wrong with you?

226
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,654
Are you trying to
make fun of me? Huh?

227
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,898
[KIKYO]
Prepare to attack!

00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,066
[LUFFY]
Whoa, what?

229
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,534
[AMAZON STOCKY]
What a vicious temper!

230
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,902
He shows his true nature!

231
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,137
[AMAZON TALL]
You see, my sisters?

232
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,906
Even after we save
his life, he turns on us.

233
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,175
Growling and snapping
like the beast he is!

234
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,111
His temperament
is indeed savage!

235
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:29,014
His words and actions lack
any elegance whatsoever!

236
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,916
We are incompatible.

237
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,887
With him and every man!

238
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,791
Even so, Kikyo, his offense
towards us is truly minor.

239
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,526
We need not kill him!

240
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,561
Hey, before you
guys shoot me,

241
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,797
just a second ago you
said you saved my life.

242
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,898
[LUFFY]
What happened?

243
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,800
I don't even know!

244
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,903
You ate a bunch of
parasitic mushrooms

245
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,772
and collapsed, then
you were found

246
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,107
and brought here
by these ladies.

247
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,981
Okay. That's what happened.
In that case, thanks a lot.

complaining about the clothes!

Just don't shoot me!

250

Your apologies are meaningless!

This is Amazon Lily,

And for centuries now, we have
upheld this absolute rule!

You shall die like every man
on this island before you.

No guys, huh?

know your true nature,

we have no sympathy for you!

do we gotta kill him?

How do you think she will feel?

268
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,762
She would never
approve of this situation!

You will also be
charged with the crime

of bringing a man
into the village!

be kept secret.

Stay back!

349
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,063
I'm not gonna do anything.

350
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,066
[MARGARET]
I've heard it said that all men

351
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,469
have some sort of
dangerous cootie virus!

352
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,071
Is that what caused you to
grow so fat all of a sudden?

353
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,806
[LUFFY]
I hate to break it to you,

354
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,175
but I don't think
cooties are real

355
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,443
and the fat thing
is kind of hard to explain,

356
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,546
so let's just say that
yeah, all guys turn fat.

357
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,181
Anyway, there was
something I left

358
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,616
in the pocket of
my old pair of pants.

359
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,752
Do you still have it?

360
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,021
'Cuz it's super
important to me.

361
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,693
Uh. Let me see.

362
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,795
Is this what you mean?

363
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,966
[LUFFY]
Yes! Yes! Man, I was so worried!

364
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,770
I dunno what I would've
done if I'd lost it!

365
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:12,211
Thank you! You're
a real lifesaver!

366
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,879
Get your hands off me!

367
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,150
Stay put! You're mine!

368
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,220
Something was written on it,
so I kept it just in case.

369
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,795
So, what is it for?

370
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,863
[LUFFY]
Here, look!

371
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,869
How unusual! It looks
like it's moving!

372
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,244
A bunch of stuff happened,

373
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,112
and then all my
friends went flying

374
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,681
through the air
in different directions.

375
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,553
But now, with this
piece of paper,

376
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,756
I can find my way back
to them, wherever they go.

377
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,995
Heh, they're strong,
so I'm not worried.

378
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,731
Anyway, guess I should pay
you back for all your help.

379
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,800
If there's anything
I can do for you, just ask.

380
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,002
Oh, there is!

381
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,870
Could you take out your family
jewels so I can see them?

382
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,673
That's not even funny!
You're gonna kill me!

383
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,975
[MARGARET] Hmph. Men are
savages and cheapskates!

384
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,210
[LUFFY]
Just put the sword down

385
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,812
and leave my jewels
alone, please!

386
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,181
These friends of yours,
who are they exactly?

387
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:23,915
Oh.

388
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,251
Well, we're all
a pirate crew.

389
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,320
Do you know what
pirates are here?

390
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,521
Yes, of course I know.

391
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:33,125
In fact, the empress of this
country is a pirate as well.

392
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,626
Whoa, really?

393
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,697
So, you guys have like
an all-girl pirate crew?

394
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,032
Are they strong?

395
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,167
[MARGARET]
What a foolish question!

396
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,673
Only the most elite
warriors are allowed

397
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,243
to ride aboard the pirate
ship of our empress!

398
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,245
So yes, of course
they're strong!

399
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,118
In this proud nation,

400
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,155
all of the women look up
to the Snake Princess!

401
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,956
Her beauty is unparalleled.

402
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,358
She's strong and noble.

403
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,593
She's called the
"Pirate Empress."

404
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,862
Boa Hancock!

405
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,198
She and her sisters are the
protectors of this island.

406
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:17,302
And, well, truth be told,
they're our heroes.

407
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,744
[AMAZON whimpers]

408
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,850
[AMAZON 409BB] Oh no!
The ship of the Snake Princess

409
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,851
is nearly here!

410
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,852
[AMAZON 409CC]
Huh?

411
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:40,158
[bell ringing]

412
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,227
Curses. This isn't good!

413
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,029
We must deal
with the man quickly!

414
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,665
[panting]

415
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,634
Kikyo, he jumped over
the wall and disappeared.

416
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,236
What should we do now?

417
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,373
[KIKYO]
Warriors! To the jungle!

418
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:59,044
We will rescue Margaret.
Then put the man to death!

419
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,280
The Snake Princess
has returned!

420
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,927
[NARRATOR]
Navy Vice-Admiral Momonga

421
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,362
contacts the Kuja Pirates

422
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,065
with an official
summons for Boa Hancock.

423
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,868
However, despite being one
of the Warlords of the Sea,

424
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,037
Hancock refuses the Navy's
request and unleashes

425
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,274
her Devil Fruit power on
the unsuspecting marines!

426
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,909
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

427
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,179
"Everyone Falls in Love!
Pirate Empress Hancock!."

428
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,681
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
