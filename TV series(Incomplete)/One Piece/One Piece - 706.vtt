00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.658
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.932
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.435
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.476
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:12.852
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:17.027
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.731
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:24.809
and launch an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:29.653
But the tale of Law, Doflamingo,
and his younger brother Corazon,

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:33.126
began years ago,
when Law was still a child.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.100
Look, Law! I brought
a surprise with me!

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.576
[ROSINANTE] Eat up and heal up!
What're you waiting for?

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.115
[LAW]
It's gross!

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:47.188
I don't care!
Just eat the damn thing!

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:50.026
You chew and swallow!

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.605
Corazon's work, I'm sure.

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:58.043
In other words,
don't let him go anywhere!

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.413
He has the Op-Op Fruit!

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:06.325
There's nowhere to run.

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:11.002
[ROSINANTE]
I don't think I can save myself,

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:13.574
but maybe I can still save him.

00:04:14.743 --> 00:04:17.682
[ROSINANTE]
This may be the end of the road,

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.821
but I hope you'll
remember me when I'm gone.

00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:25.430
[ROSINANTE] I promise
I'll go out with a smile.

00:04:30.174 --> 00:04:32.444
[ROSINANTE]
Maybe it's not worth much,

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:35.450
but if you do think
back on me someday...

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.995
[ROSINANTE] ...I'd rather
you remember me smiling.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.942
[ROSINANTE]
We gotta get moving, buddy.

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:55.190
[gasps, screams]

00:04:55.224 --> 00:04:56.960
Let's go!

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:12.224
[BARRELS PIRATES yelling]

00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.161
[BARRELS PIRATE A]
Please! Stop!

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:15.463
It's madness!

00:05:15.496 --> 00:05:18.203
I don't know how
to describe this!

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:20.240
Suddenly, the whole town
was surrounded by

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:22.311
some kind of giant cage.

00:05:22.344 --> 00:05:24.048
We can't get in!

00:05:24.081 --> 00:05:26.553
And all the pirates went insane!

00:05:26.586 --> 00:05:29.926
They're screaming and running
and cutting each other down!

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.131
It's a massacre!

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:35.805
[BARRELS PIRATE E] Drie! Don't
run away, you gotta help me!

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:37.976
There has to some
way out of here!

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.017
Don't go! We need you!

00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:43.754
[BARRELS PIRATE E screams]

00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:47.895
A raid!

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.776
[BARRELS PIRATE J screams]
It's the Don Quixote Family!

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.814
Drie! Damn!

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:59.184
Where the hell'd
that brat run off to?

00:05:59.217 --> 00:06:01.690
It's life or death
and he's gone!

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.330
Guess our strongest fighter
is our biggest coward, huh?

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:08.503
We'll have to make do!

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:13.379
[BARRELS gasps]

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.053
[BARRELS groans]

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.559
[BARRELS]
Doflamingo!

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:23.399
So you're the bastard who ran
off with our Op-Op Fruit, huh?

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.607
Who "ran off"?
I'm here, you drunk!

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.443
If you hadn't lost it,

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:31.015
I'd be taking
that fruit right now!

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:35.390
[BARRELS screams]

00:06:35.423 --> 00:06:37.996
[MACHVISE]
Let's start haul-een these away!

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.064
Sounds good.

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:41.837
Just make sure you grab
every last bit, 'kay?

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.909
This is excite-een!

00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:46.580
Not too shabby!

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.719
They're pretty loaded
for a bunch of chumps!

00:06:49.752 --> 00:06:52.626
But we still need to
find Corazon, remember?

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.163
So stop fooling around!

00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:03.513
[LAO G] Buffalo! Have you
spotted anything yet?

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:09.859
[BUFFALO]
Everything's burnt to a crisp!

00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:13.533
If there's any survivors,
I sure don't see them!

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.438
--Bzzt.
--I caught a message!

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:18.644
[MARINE C] Search for
any possible victims!

00:07:18.677 --> 00:07:21.783
We took a boy into protective
custody at the coast.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:22.786
[BUFFALO gasps]

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.692
The Navy said they
took a boy into custody!

00:07:25.725 --> 00:07:27.762
And why should I care?

00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:30.768
Get your lazy asses in gear
and find Corazon!

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:32.505
--[BABY 5] Okay!
--[BUFFALO] We're on it!

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:33.708
[LAO G]
G.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:35.912
Where the hell did
that little traitor go?

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:38.617
Must've found a really
good hiding spot.

00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:39.886
Or we're wasting our time

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.692
and he already
kicked the bucket!

00:07:52.478 --> 00:07:55.117
[VERGO]
Doffy. This is our boss.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.391
So this one little guy
knocked everyone out cold, huh?

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:02.866
You must have
some powerful Haki!

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:05.938
[ROSINANTE]
Brother, you can't do this!

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:09.345
Doflamingo!

00:08:09.378 --> 00:08:14.087
Why? Why did you
take my power from me?

00:08:14.922 --> 00:08:18.229
[TREBOL] Do you want me to
give you the strength

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:21.268
to take revenge?

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:25.678
Father, we have to live with
this mess you put us in!

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:30.387
Unless I take your head back
to the Holyland, that is!

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.223
[sobs]

00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:39.205
Doflamingo. Rosinante.

00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:41.009
[DOFLAMINGO gasps]

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:46.586
You have a very foolish
father. I'm sorry.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:02.685
[ROSINANTE screaming, crying]

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:15.711
[ROSINANTE panting]

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.434
[ROSINANTE]
Hey!

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:28.970
[GLADIUS]
It's you!

00:09:32.176 --> 00:09:36.619
[PICA] Doffy! It sounds like
Gladius ran into Corazon.

00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:42.731
[ROSINANTE] Listen, Law, stay
still and they won't find you.

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:46.506
This is a trick that always
works against pirates!

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:48.409
[GLADIUS]
I saw Corazon go that way!

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:51.716
--[gunshot]
--Lao G! Over here!

00:09:51.749 --> 00:09:53.654
[TREBOL laughs]

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:54.990
[GLADIUS]
Close in on him!

00:09:55.023 --> 00:09:57.293
[MACHVISE]
You're gonna get a crush-een!

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.599
[gunshot]

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.271
[LAW]
Why can't I open this lid?

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:03.440
Is something sitting on it?

00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:05.845
--[gunshot]
--Cora!

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:08.349
Your aim really does stink!

Let me try! Vipera Glaive!

00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:31.295
[LAO G yells]

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.571
[TREBOL laughs]
Watch out!

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:37.174
[TREBOL laughs]

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.712
Sticky Launcher!

00:10:46.425 --> 00:10:49.832
[TREBOL laughs]

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:56.579
I got you now!

00:10:56.613 --> 00:11:00.319
[ROSINANTE screams]

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:02.224
Diamante!

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.930
[DIAMANTE]
Aw, yeah!

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:07.100
[yells]

00:11:17.487 --> 00:11:21.796
[chuckles] That smarts.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.071
[laughs]

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:30.881
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:40.667
[GLADIUS]
Why have you been pretending

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.472
that you can't
talk all this time?

00:11:44.842 --> 00:11:47.882
Because I've got
nothing to talk about.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:50.353
Not to garbage like you punks.

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:55.463
[GLADIUS] Insolence! You made
a fool of the Young Master!

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:59.104
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:03.981
You've done enough, Gladius.

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:08.056
We can't have him die
before the Young Master arrives.

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:12.532
[TREBOL laughs]
Let us have some fun!

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.971
You were trying to lure the Navy
into an all-out war with us,

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:19.010
weren't you, ya lying bastard?

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:22.752
You're quite the
little villain, huh?

00:12:22.785 --> 00:12:24.120
[ROSINANTE groans]

00:12:30.935 --> 00:12:32.037

Hey! The Young Master's here!

[coughing]

00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:10.079
[DOFLAMINGO] I haven't seen you
in six months. Corazon.

00:14:00.246 --> 00:14:01.983
Hey, whoa!

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:19.050
[ROSINANTE crying]

00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:21.188
[SENGOKU]
You have nowhere to go?

00:14:22.525 --> 00:14:25.597
Well. You're safe with us.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:45.269
[ROSINANTE]
Marine Code 01746.

00:14:45.302 --> 00:14:50.446
Rosinante. Commander from HQ.

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:56.693
[ROSINANTE] Captain of the Don
Quixote Family. Doflamingo.

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:58.028
I've been working undercover

00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:00.534
to prevent a tragedy
of your making.

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:03.472
That has been my mission

00:15:03.507 --> 00:15:06.478
I took as a Marine.

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:24.883
I lied to you. Sorry.

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:28.388
I didn't want you to
hate me, that's all.

00:15:31.095 --> 00:15:33.700
[LAW]
Why are saying this now?

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:37.941
I already knew! Of course I did!

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.181
[GLADIUS]
An apology?

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.686
You really think we'll
show mercy on you now?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.027
I don't have the patience
for your insipid little jokes.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.400
So, you'd better answer
my questions now!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:53.740
Where is the Op-Op Fruit
and where is Law?

00:15:55.644 --> 00:15:59.785
[ROSINANTE] The Op-Op Fruit?
That's long gone.

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:01.957
Law ate it right up.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.058
[GLADIUS, LAO G gasp]

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:05.697
In other words,
he's a power-holder.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.237
That's how he was able to
get out of your cage.

00:16:09.271 --> 00:16:10.840
There's a Navy
lookout ship nearby

00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:14.782
that probably took him in
to protective custody already.

00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:17.588
Which means he's safe from you.

00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:24.100
Young Master!

00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:26.038
[BABY 5] We heard over
the radio that the Navy

00:16:26.071 --> 00:16:28.677
took a boy into
custody at the coast!

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.983
[DOFLAMINGO] Why didn't you
tell me sooner? This is urgent!

00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:34.188
[BUFFALO] I swear,
I got here as fast as I could!

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:36.324
[BABY 5]
We're sorry!

00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:42.170
[ROSINANTE] A boy?
Lucky coincidence, I guess.

00:16:42.203 --> 00:16:44.440
Since Law is here.

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.590
I'll undo the Birdcage!

00:16:51.623 --> 00:16:54.094
Go check into that, quickly!

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:58.169
[ROSINANTE] I don't understand,
but I'm grateful.

00:16:58.202 --> 00:17:02.511
It seems that fate is conspiring
to keep you alive, Law.

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:06.018
[ROSINANTE]
One guardian angel after another

00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:09.124
keeps swooping in to save you.

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:11.395
All of you, prepare to set sail!

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:12.865
If what we just heard was true,

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:15.102
we need to attack
that Navy Ship!

00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:17.842
Then we'll take back Law!

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:22.150
Don't bother. What would
you do with him?

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:25.323
What would I do?
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:28.228
If Law ate the Op-Op Fruit,
like you said,

00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:30.901
he needs to be
educated properly.

00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:34.575
So the boy can die for me.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.246
[DOFLAMINGO] You really have
gone out of your way

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:39.652
to cause me trouble,
haven't you?

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:42.991
Why do you insist on
undermining your brother?

00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:44.562
Why are you
forcing me to do this?

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:47.868
To kill my own flesh
and blood yet again!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.278
[LAW] Cora, you sure
you're gonna be okay?

00:17:57.153 --> 00:18:01.094
You point that gun,
but I know you can't shoot me.

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:04.034
Because in the end,
you're just like your father.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:07.306
[LAW] You told me
we'd escape together!

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.647
[ROSINANTE]
Listen, Law.

00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:13.452
When a pirate sees a treasure
chest like that one,

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:14.889
they can't resist picking it up

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:17.194
and taking it on
their ship with them.

00:18:17.227 --> 00:18:19.932
That means, as long as
you stay in here,

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:23.038
you'll definitely have a chance
to get out of this cage.

00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:24.007
So don't move!

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.877
What about you?

00:18:27.013 --> 00:18:29.619
That's okay! You ate the fruit.

00:18:29.652 --> 00:18:33.259
That's the only thing
Doffy's really interested in.

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:36.198
Besides, he and I
are brothers, remember?

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:37.701
He might get mad, sure,

00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:41.676
but it's not like he's gonna
kill his own flesh and blood.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.278
And Calm.

00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:47.855
[ROSINANTE] Now, even if you
rumble around in there,

00:18:47.888 --> 00:18:50.493
it won't make any noise.

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:53.833
I'll see you in the
next town, all right?

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.804
Hey. Law?

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:58.810
I love you, kid!

00:18:58.843 --> 00:19:01.348
[laughs]

00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:10.466
[LAW] This isn't what you
promised me at all, Cora!

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:13.506
You said he wasn't
gonna kill you!

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:20.653
Law wouldn't obey you
anyway, Doffy. Sorry.

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:24.796
[ROSINANTE]
He only had three years to live.

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:29.004
And he knew that,
but he kept fighting anyway.

00:19:29.037 --> 00:19:31.909
He grew much stronger.

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:35.383
[ROSINANTE]
He found himself again.

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:37.120
He's not the same lost child

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:40.527
who threw himself before
a killer like you.

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:42.296
He has nothing to gain
from someone

00:19:42.329 --> 00:19:44.702
who only longs for destruction.

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:46.606
He's above that.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.444
[ROSINANTE]
So you leave him the hell alone.

00:19:49.477 --> 00:19:52.818
'Cause Law's finally free now!

00:20:14.762 --> 00:20:18.469
[ROSINANTE] You say that again!
Who did you call a monster?

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:22.209
[LAW] Whoa! He tripped
and he's on fire!

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.214
[ROSINANTE]
See? Slept well, right?

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:26.519
[LAW]
Cut it out!

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:07.834
[ROSINANTE]
I love you, kid!

00:21:19.024 --> 00:21:20.994
[ROSINANTE]
Not yet.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:26.304
[ROSINANTE] I have to survive
just a little bit longer.

00:21:29.544 --> 00:21:32.550
[MACHVISE]
Pull the ship over here!

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.690
[ROSINANTE]
Because if I die now,

00:21:35.724 --> 00:21:39.531
the spell I cast will
be broken in an instant.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.206
[ROSINANTE] And if you cry
or make a single noise,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.614
anyone on the island
might hear it.

00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:50.653
[ROSINANTE]
Pick yourself up, Law.

00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:55.029
[ROSINANTE]
Go silently. Unseen.

00:21:55.063 --> 00:21:58.570
Farther and farther.

00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:01.742
There's nothing to
bind you down anymore.

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:05.382
[ROSINANTE] Not the iron
borders of White Town,

00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:08.155
or the sickness
that hounded you.

00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:10.860
Your life is finally your own.

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:15.103
Hurry it up!
That's Tsuru's warship!

00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:16.805
Dammit!

00:22:30.633 --> 00:22:35.810
[ROSINANTE] So don't be sad.
You're free now.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:42.891
[sobbing]

00:22:42.925 --> 00:22:44.026
[TSURU]
Fire!

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.202
[DIAMANTE gasps]

00:22:48.235 --> 00:22:55.415
[LAW crying]

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:09.176
[screams]

00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.325
[NARRATOR]
Sacrificing his own life,

00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:19.064
Corazon paved Law's
path to the future.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:22.003
Now, in order to claim
his freedom once and for all,

00:23:22.036 --> 00:23:23.873
Law takes aim at Doflamingo

00:23:23.906 --> 00:23:28.181
and makes the shot that Corazon
could not all those years ago.

00:23:28.215 --> 00:23:29.819
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:33.726
"To Be Free!
Law's Injection Shot Blasts!"

00:23:33.759 --> 00:23:36.765
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
