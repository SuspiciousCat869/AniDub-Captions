1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:42,262
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

39
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,498
and everything else
the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,672
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

42
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,773
You can have it!

43
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,377
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,113
Now you just have to find it!

45
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,550
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

46
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,519
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

47
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,789
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

48
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,831
[ACCINO] The flag of the
notorious Straw Hat Pirates,

49
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,734
whose collective bounty
is more than 600 million.

50
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,769
Isn't that right...

51
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:27,840
...Mr. 120 million
Berry bounty, Roronoa Zoro?

52
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,579
What the hell are you doing
with our flag, you bastard?

53
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,416
[LUFFY] Mansion of Great Chaos!

54
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,352
The Enraged Don
and the Captured Crew!

55
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,256
Oh, no...

56
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,460
Luffy!

57
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,398
That was close!
I almost fell into the water!

58
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,404
[BRINDO]
It doesn't matter what you do.

59
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,544
[CAMPACINO] Even a man with
a 300 million Berry bounty

60
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,380
is no match for our
glorious brotherhood!

61
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,349
Blah, blah, blah.
Enough talk!

62
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,551
Gimme back our flag, you jerks!

63
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,587
[CAMPACINO] If you manage
to best our brotherhood,

64
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,490
then and only then
will we honor your request.

65
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,759
[BOTH]
And show you where the flag is.

66
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,195
[BRINDO and CAMPACINO laugh]

67
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,229
Fine then!

68
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,699
Slippery!

69
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,602
[BRINDO] Looks like you're
going to have some trouble

70
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,637
fighting on the ice.

71
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,305
[LUFFY] So what? You will, too!

72
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,275
[CAMPACINO]
I wouldn't be so sure.

73
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,510
[BRINDO, CAMPACINO] The Accino
family knows The Frozen Highway

74
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,379
like the back of our hand.

75
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,314
There's no way that
you or anyone else

76
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,515
could defeat us here.

77
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,317
We have the
home field advantage.

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,352
Besides, the strong
magnetic power

79
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,655
that binds us together
makes us unstoppable.

80
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,924
Not even the infamous Monkey
D. Luffy could overcome it!

81
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,693
Twin brothers!

82
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,495
I don't care about
any of that crap!

83
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,430
Come on! Let's fight already!

84
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,466
I'll beat the hell outta
both of you! Let's go!

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,834
Cocky punk!

86
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,973
Now Gum-Gum... Pistol!

87
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,481
Now, Monkey D. Luffy!

88
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,416
Our brotherhood...

89
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,450
...is coming for your head!

90
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,785
Prepare yourself!

91
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,525
[BRINDO] Very impressive!

92
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,428
Let's both have a go
at him at once, Campacino.

93
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,663
Yes, Papa is waiting for us.

94
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,433
You're going--augh!

95
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,801
[LUFFY laughing]

96
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,869
[LUFFY]
What're you guys, a comedy act?

97
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,338
Stop laughing!

98
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,808
Should have expected treachery
with a bounty that high.

99
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,843
How dare you do that to us!

100
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,678
No way. I didn't do that.

101
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,580
You two fell on your own.

102
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,817
You filthy, stinking pirate!

103
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,486
We'll teach you
to make fun of us!

104
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,956
[BRINDO, CAMPACINO]
You miscreant! You'll pay!

105
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,007
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke!

106
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,021
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke ke ke ke!

107
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,256
Hey, turd!

108
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,625
You're gonna regret screwing
around with my Shark Submerge

109
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,793
when I get outta here!

110
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,462
I'll shove that hockey stick
where the sun don't shine!

111
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,364
[HOCKERA]
Hoh ke ke ke ke!

112
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,832
[HOCKERA]
I'd like to see you try!

113
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,701
Soon, you'll
all be frozen solid!

114
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,003
Now that you're trapped,
it's only a matter of time!

115
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,538
[FRANKY]
Ugh, I hate that guy!

116
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,740
[NAMI] It's colder in here
than it was in the sub!

117
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,375
What's up with this place?

118
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,944
[USOPP] Help... me...!

119
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,813
[NAMI] Sanji! Usopp!

120
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,982
Nami! Please, save me!

121
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,784
I'm so sorry, Nami.

122
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,119
Bastards got the drop on me.

123
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,721
[FRANKY] Are you two all right?

124
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,757
[SANJI] Yeah.
You got here just in time.

125
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,027
[ARBELL] Good. Now all we need
are the other four bounties.

126
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,130
Ugh! I'm so sick of all
these stupid bounty hunters!

127
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,832
Why is this place so cold?

128
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,800
It's like an icy hell.

129
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,735
The ice that makes up
the walls and floor

130
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,370
of this cavern
has been hardening

131
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,572
for the past 400 years.

132
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,375
[ARBELL] Anything inside it
will be frozen within minutes.

133
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,777
You could say it's like
a gigantic freezer.

134
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,045
Understand?

135
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,381
Your explanation
was amazing, Arbell!

136
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,383
So easy to follow!

137
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,617
Which happens first?

138
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,387
We capture your friends, or the
rest of you freeze to death?

139
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,456
I look forward to finding out.

140
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,033
By now, I'm sure
the rest of your crew

141
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,636
has fallen into the
capable hands of my family.

142
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,971
Damn. What a shame.

143
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,906
Guess I'll just
have to cut you down.

144
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,075
And you were being
so hospitable, too.

145
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,510
[ACCINO] Cut me down?

146
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,046
You don't have
what it takes, boy.

147
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,155
I take it you have
Devil Fruit powers.

148
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,723
Every single thing I touch

149
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,426
can be melted
down into liquid.

150
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,927
And, of course,
that would include

151
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,630
those splendid
swords of yours.

152
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,169
[ACCINO] That is the ability
of the Hot-Hot Fruit!

153
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:31,577
[ZORO] So all I have to do is
not let you touch me, right?

154
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,480
[ZORO]
Thirty-six Caliber Phoenix!

155
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,923
[ZORO] What?

156
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,726
[choked screaming]

157
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,001
You bastard!

158
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
Be careful where
you swing that thing!

159
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,438
You could have
harmed my collection!

160
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,676
[ZORO] What the hell
is going on here?

161
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,442
[SANJI] Troisieme Hache!

162
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,777
Hey, let me take a crack at it!

163
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,246
Strong Hammer!

164
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,848
[USOPP] Gunpowder Star! Usopp
Hammer! Rubber Band of Doom!

165
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,484
Gunpowder Star! Usopp Hammer!
Rubber Band of Doom!

166
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,053
Gunpowder Star! Usopp Hammer!

167
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,656
[ARBELL] There's no point
in trying to escape.

168
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,658
You'll never crack those walls.

169
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,927
--Just lie down and die!
--[USOPP shouting attacks]

170
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,930
Looks like the only
way outta here is up.

171
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:41,931
[NAMI]
Franky!

172
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,065
[USOPP]
Gunpowder Star!

173
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:49,238
[USOPP] This ice thinks
it's a real tough guy!

174
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:50,940
Guess that's enough
damage for one day.

175
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:51,974
Hey!

176
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:53,776
Yeah? What's up?

177
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,578
Look. Think you can make it?

178
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,782
Sure!

179
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,985
I think I got just enough of the
good stuff for one last shot.

180
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:07,023
[FRANKY] Here we go!
Is everybody ready?

181
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:07,990
Yeah!

182
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,792

183
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:13,262

184
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:14,730
[USOPP] Fart power!

185
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,066
[FRANKY] Ah! Crap, I'm out!

186
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:17,767
[NAMI] What?

187
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,035
[SANJI] Leave the rest to me!

188
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,908
Dammit!

189
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,146
Hoh ke ke ke ke ke!

190
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,081
Fool! Never underestimate us!

191
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,583
[ARBELL] Do me a favor
and freeze already!

192
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:39,955

[ACCINO HENCHMAN 332B]
Arbell! It's terrible!

195
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:45,161
Come quickly! Mister Accino
is out of control!

196
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,630
Right! I understand!
I'll be right there!

197
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,802
[SALCHOW] Seems we have more
pressing matters to tend to!

198
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,603
Sit tight, keep quiet.
We'll be back!

199
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,572
[ARBELL] Hurry up, darling!

200
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,009
Look, guys!

201
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:00,843
We gotta find a way outta here

202
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,212
before we really do
freeze to death!

203
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:07,783
[HOCKERA] Papa, wait!

204
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:08,884
[ARBELL, SALCHOW, HOCKERA]
Papa!

205
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,252
[ACCINO] Ah!

206
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:11,320
This is bad!

207
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:13,122
It's like a sauna in here!

208
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,024
Honey? What do we do?

209
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,926
It's impossible
to control Papa's temper

210
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,127
when he gets like this!

211
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,096
Just keep on smiling.

212
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,831
What's wrong, Papa?

213
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:22,898
[ACCINO] You!

214
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,336
Why are my birthday
presents running around free?

215
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,172
Why haven't they been
properly imprisoned yet?

216
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:36,045
[ARBELL] Papa! Listen!
I assure you, they're--augh!

217
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,247
[HOCKERA] It's Roronoa Zoro!

218
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,849
[SALCHOW] Why are you here?

219
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,819
All right. You're going down.

220
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,789
Stop ignoring us!

221
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,224
Two-Sword Style...

222
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:49,358
[HOCKERA] Think! Where was it?

223
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,593
[ZORO]
...Hawk...

[yelling]

225
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,801
[ARBELL]
I'm terribly sorry, Papa!

226
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:02,271
One rat managed to avoid the
trap, but it won't happen again!

227
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,673
Yes! My darling
is absolutely right!

228
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,643
Don't worry! We'll round up the
rest of them in no time at all!

229
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,681
Your flag collection
is already so impressive!

230
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,083
And it just grew by one!

231
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,418
[SALCHOW] And our
brothers are bringing in

232
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:18,254
the last members of
their crew as we speak!

233
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,922
[ARBELL] It's true, Papa!

234
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:36,038
[LUFFY]
Damn. You sure are tough.

235
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,174
Even after you split in two.

236
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,875
We're not clones, we're twins!

237
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:42,144
Pay attention to
what people tell you!

238
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,078
Come along, now.

239
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:45,080
Our papa is waiting for us.

240
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,982
It's time to end this game.

241
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,726
Ready, Brindo?

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,128
Ready, Campacino!

243
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,865
Crap!

244
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,468
Monkey D. Luffy!

245
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,436
Your head is ours!

246
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:20,249
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

247
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:25,120

250
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,064
What is it now?

251
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,833
Yes. Right.

252
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,436
I understand, then.

253
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,103

Click.

254
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,005
[LUFFY] Come back, cowards!

255
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,139
Stop running away!

256
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,876
[CAMPACINO] You've avoided
death for the time being!

257
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,844
We'll deal with you later!

258
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:50,846
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

259
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,749
It's Papa. It seems he's
gone berserk once again.

260
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:55,818
We've gotta get back there fast!

261
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:58,387
I won't let you
get away! Come here!

262
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:05,327
Damn it!

263
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:08,898
Hey! Gimme back our flag!

264
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,114
[NAMI] Stay awake, you idiot!

265
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,949
If you fall asleep, you'll die!

266
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:28,450
Come on, Usopp!

267
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,119
[USOPP] Nami... Stop it.

268
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:33,022
I'm in the middle
of a beautiful dream.

269
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,091
Ahh! Just listen
to those birds chirping!

270
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,192
Merry!

271
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,795
You came back to take me
to the other side with you!

272
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:40,563
How nice!

273
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:41,897
[NAMI, SANJI, FRANKY]
Wake up!

274
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,036
Are you trying to kill me?

[metallic thud]

276
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,010

Zoro?!

278
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,280
Oh! There you are!
Where have you been?

279
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,883
We should be asking you that!

280
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,351
But more importantly,

281
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,853
I just saw our flag
in their bosses' hands.

282
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,221
How'd that happen?

283
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:08,857
So it is here!
Now to get it back.

284
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:10,092
And we need to do it quick,

285
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,927
before Luffy
notices anything.

286
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,829
Geez. Can't you
even manage to protect

287
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:16,932
one tiny little flag,
imitation cook?

288
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,068
You're one to talk, aren't you?

289
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,303
You were too busy being
lost to protect anything.

290
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,504
You're pathetic.

291
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,976
Now is not the time for that!

292
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,547
It's good to see
you're all energetic.

293
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,882
Hey! Robin!

294
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,951
Robin!

00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,152
--[ZORO] Moron.
--[SANJI] What?!

296
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,989
Robin! Help us outta here!

297
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,625
Yeah! We could use a hand!

298
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:44,593
[LIL] As much as I
don't want to admit it,

299
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,596
you should be down there
with them, big sister.

300
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,599
[LIL] But I think my new
friend Robin is special.

301
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,902
That's why I'm going
to ask Papa to spare her.

302
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,137
Good thing, too.

303
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,941
Because Papa will do anything
I say as long as I ask nice.

304
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,175
Oh?

305
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,344
[LIL] So, are you coming
to the party with me?

306
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,380
What kind of party?

307
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:05,447
For Papa.

308
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:08,050
A gigantic birthday feast!

309
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:11,587
Well? Have you said
your goodbyes to everyone?

310
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,457
--[NAMI] Robin! Robin! Look!
--[USOPP] No! Don't go!

311
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:18,260
--[SANJI] Save us, please!
--[NAMI] Robin!

[ALL calling after Robin]

313
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,568
Right. Shall we be going then?

314
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,003
[LIL] You mean it?

315
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,975
[LIL]
Come on! Follow me!

316
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,577
Let's go! It's this way!

317
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,913
Wait! Why are you leaving us?

318
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,249
Robin! Come back!

319
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,518
Please don't
abandon me, my love!

320
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,023
[LUFFY] Chopper!

321
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,661
[CHOPPER and JIRO screaming]

322
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:56,398
I'm back!

323
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,233
I think you need to
work on that landing!

324
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,069
Are you trying
to sink our ship?

325
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,186
Sorry!

326
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:11,622
[LIL] What's the matter?

327
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,624
Does it seem hot
in here to you?

328
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,160
Oh, no.

329
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:21,465
[LIL] I was afraid of this.
Papa's angry.

330
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,933
Let's leave for now.

331
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,301
When Papa gets like this,

332
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,503
it's better to just
stay away from him.

333
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:27,771
I see.

334
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:31,975
[LIL] At this rate, everything
around here is gonna melt away!

335
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,278
[LIL] Come on!
Let's go play in my room!

336
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,579
Say, would it be all right

337
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,115
to bring those snacks
and that juice with us?

338
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,288
They don't taste very good
when they're hot, you know.

339
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,622
Thanks, but I don't mind.

340
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:47,391
And besides,
it's part of another favor

341
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:48,992
I'd like to ask of you.

342
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:54,298
All right, pirates.

343
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,399
I've got some
provisions for you.

344
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:58,235
Compliments of Princess Lil's
new partner, Robin.

345
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,406
New partner?

346
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,674
[SANJI]
Robin, huh?

347
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:09,580
My love!
You do still care for me!

348
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:13,550
Hey! Franky! We got some cola!

349
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:16,487
Sweet! We'll get it right
this time for sure!

351
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,701

353
00:18:37,107 --> 00:18:38,575
[FRANKY]
...Vent!

354
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,148
[FRANKY] Coup de Boo!

355
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:48,552
We gotta make up
for lost time, you guys.

356
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,287
Now let's go get that flag!

357
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,555
[ALL] Yeah!

358
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,127
[LUFFY] Time to go, Chopper!

359
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:57,961
[CHOPPER] Right!

360
00:18:57,995 --> 00:18:59,796
No! Hold on!
I wanna come with you!

361
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,165
I'm begging you!

362
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,232
[CHOPPER] Jiro...

363
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,101
[PUZZLE] Wait!

364
00:19:05,202 --> 00:19:06,803
[PUZZLE] Don't go.

365
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,071
Please, stay here.

366
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,206
[JIRO] Captain!

367
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:12,509
There's no reason for
you to risk your life over this.

368
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:13,577
It's not worth it.

369
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,678
It's all right.

370
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:16,680
I know that if we
reclaim our flag,

371
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:18,415
our captain will
rise like a phoenix

372
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,217
and be who he was before.

373
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,318
Just you wait!

374
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm gonna save us all!

375
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,322
Don't talk nonsense.

376
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:28,792
No. I've already given up.
It's over.

377
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,330
So you've
already given up, huh?

378
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,765
How can you say that?

379
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,669
That isn't the captain
I used to know.

380
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,470
Those aren't
the words of the man

381
00:19:40,504 --> 00:19:42,673
who's gonna be
King of the Pirates!

382
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:45,809
Listen up.

383
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,778
I still believe in you, Puzzle.

384
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,616
You're the man who will be
King of the Pirates someday!

385
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,557
I know I'm small and not
very strong, but I don't care!

386
00:20:00,591 --> 00:20:03,293
I believe in you!
You'll see!

387
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,229
I'll bring back
the flag and...

388
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,397
What?!

389
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,237
Luffy!
What did you do that for?

390
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,771
[LUFFY] I'm sick of
hearing all that nonsense.

391
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:15,839
[STANSEN] What's wrong with you?

392
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,709
[JIRO] Yeah, what gives?
I thought we were friends!

393
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:19,810
[LUFFY] And listen, you!

394
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,779
A pirate doesn't give up
til he can't stand anymore!

395
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:24,314
You're just a big coward!

396
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,315
[JIRO] That's enough!

397
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,817
[LUFFY] There's no way
that guy could ever be

398
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,286
King of the Pirates!

399
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,356
There's only one man
who can claim that: Me!

400
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,224
You're wrong!

401
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:37,427
I decided Captain Puzzle
will be King of the Pirates!

402
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:40,564
No matter what you say, I won't
let you step on his dream!

403
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,472
No!

404
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,715
Look, Jiro.

405
00:20:58,749 --> 00:21:01,351
You're a lot stronger
than you think.

406
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,222
And your strength is
right where it needs to be.

407
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,523
Luffy, I...

408
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,693
All right.

409
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,664
I say we beat those guys and
get our flags back together!

410
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:14,364
Yeah!

411
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,299
Anyone who thinks they can steal

412
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:18,702
my pirate flag's
got another thing coming!

413
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,170
[PUZZLE] Stop it!

414
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:22,873
There's no reason
for you to fight them!

415
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,408
Please. Stay.

416
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,409
Don't worry!

417
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,743
I won't let those guys hurt me.

418
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:30,380
This is the only way
we can move forward, right?

419
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,849
Besides, that's what pirates
are supposed to do.

420
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:40,724
What a bunch of fools!

421
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,227
Jiro's risking his life and
it's all because of me!

422
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:53,470
[PUZZLE yelling]

423
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,408
I'm sorry to make
you worry, Captain.

424
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:06,383
I want you to go after Jiro.

425
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:09,786
[LAGO, BASIL, SUTTON, GUYLE]
Yes, sir.

426
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,290
Hey, Nami...

427
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:15,892
Is it really a good idea
for us to follow Zoro?

428
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,127
Shut up, jerk!

429
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:22,999
[CAMPACINO] We're planning the
party to end all parties, Papa.

430
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,569
Come on. Cheer up for us, okay?

431
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,614
Hey you!
Gimme back our flag!

432
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:40,650
What the...

433
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:42,285
Great.
Sounds like Luffy's here.

434
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,754
We don't have any time to waste!

435
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,622
[NAMI] Come on, guys!
Let's get moving!

436
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,671
See, Papa?
It's like I told you.

437
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:05,609
Your birthday present is
coming together as planned!

438
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:08,578
I see that.
Sorry for getting mad.

439
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:19,890
[SANJI] Hey! Mosshead!

440
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,458
Are you sure you know
where these jerks

441
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,793
are keeping our flag?

442
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,594
[ZORO] Shut up!
Let me think for a second!

443
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,696
I think it's... this way.

444
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,699
[SANJI] We must be insane to
follow an idiot like you around.

445
00:23:29,733 --> 00:23:33,036
[ZORO] Here! This is
totally the place! I think.

446
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,805
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

447
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:36,473
The Return of the Phoenix!

448
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:39,810
The Dream of the Pirate Flag
Sworn to a Friend!

449
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:42,479
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
