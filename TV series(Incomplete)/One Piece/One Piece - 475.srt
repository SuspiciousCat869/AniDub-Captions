1
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,690
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,360
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,061
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,064
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,498
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,235
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,070
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,006
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,842
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,378
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,045
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,048
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,719
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,989
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,192
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:17,030
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,670
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,039
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,907
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,842
With the aid of
the Whitebeard Pirates,

21
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,812
he pushes toward the scaffold,
only to be halted by

22
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,981
massive encircling walls,
activated by the Navy.

23
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,917
But with a helping hand
from Jimbei,

24
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,553
Luffy is able to propel
himself over the walls

25
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,656
and land inside the plaza!

26
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,891
Luffy!

27
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,593
I'm comin' for ya!

28
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,030
I'll save you!

29
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,034
[LUFFY yells]

30
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,869
What is that?

31
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,979
[PIRATE JJ]
They've closed us in!

32
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,248
[PIRATE KK]
What the hell's going on?

33
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:12,185
[SENGOKU]
You know what to do, Akainu!

34
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,558
Meteor Volcano!

35
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,461
[AKAINU shouts]

36
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:31,404
Holy crap... That's lava.

37
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,008
They've got nowhere to run.

38
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,411
Now we'll melt that ice
and drown them all!

39
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,388
[PIRATES screaming]

40
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,260
[WHITEBEARD gasps]

41
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,704
[WHITEBEARD]
I'm sorry, old friend.

42
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,374
[SENGOKU] The plan is working
perfectly, so we'll proceed.

43
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:11,345
Phase two is the
immediate execution

44
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,314
of Portgas D. Ace!

45
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:17,317
[PIRATES shouting]

46
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,885
[LUFFY]
Jimbei.

47
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,087
[panting]

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,724
I need a favor from you.

49
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:28,094
[JIMBEI]
Ocean Current Shoulder Throw!

50
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:35,169
I see. So you found a way up.

51
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,704
You've done quite well,
son of Dragon.

52
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,506
You're standing tall now.

53
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,543
Ahh, youth. So much fire!

54
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,012
Back off!

55
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:51,184
You're not gonna kill Ace!

56
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,889
[LUFFY yelling]

57
00:05:54,922 --> 00:06:01,061
Gum-Gum Stamp Gatling!

"Moving into the Final Phase!

[LUFFY yelling]

63
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,967
[COBY gasps]
I knew Luffy was nuts,

64
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,071
but he'll join his brother
five feet under at this rate!

65
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,605
He signed his own death warrant!

66
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,108
He'll be dead before
the ink can dry!

67
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:53,747
[YAMAKAJI]
Huh?

68
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,316
[LUFFY]
Now for Second Gear!

69

[AKAINU grunts]

70
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,590
Straight to Ace. I don't have
time to fight these guys!

71
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,192
[KIZARU] Hmm. Trying
to sneak by us, huh?

72
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,098
[gasps]

73
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,466
[KIZARU]
Huh.

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,502
You almost made it.

[LUFFY yells]

76
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,783
Luffy!

77
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,685
He is so dead!

[LUFFY gasps]

84
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,317
Now, do it!

85
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,523
Ace, no!

86
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,024
You monsters!

87
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,460
No! Stop!

[SENGOKU]
You bastard!

98
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,794
[SENGOKU] I thought
it would be advantageous

99
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,763
to have you here for the battle,

100
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:26,367
since you hold a grudge
against Whitebeard.

101
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,035
Curse you, Crocodile!

102
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:34,441
[LUFFY gasps]
No way!

103
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,780
What's goin' on? Thought I'd
have a chance to show off.

104
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,148
Just a short while ago

105
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,317
Crocodile was trying
to murder Whitebeard.

106
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,286
Wonder what transpired to
make him change his mind.

107
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,427
[CROCODILE] I can kill
that old, dying buzzard

108
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,430
whenever I feel like it.

109
00:09:56,463 --> 00:10:01,301
But as for right now, I'm not
gonna let you taste victory.

110
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,870
You and your crooked operation.

111
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,378
[MARINES gasping]

112
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,652
Hey, pal. Do you remember me?

113
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,354
I-It's Doflamingo!

114
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,289
First you turn me down,

115
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,292
and now you wanna
team up with Whitebeard?

116
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,798
You've got some nerve
playing me like that.

117
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,333
[chuckles]

118
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,239
Don't be foolish. I'm not
teaming up with anybody.

119
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,142
Either way, you're giving my
friendship a cold shoulder.

120
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,678
I can't say I appreciate that.

121
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,346
Deal with it.

122
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,902
Those two are distracting
everybody else. Now's my chance!

123
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,804

Not another step, Straw Hat!

ends right now!

Damn it! That hurts!

149
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,490
[AOKIJI] I still owe your
grandfather a favor, Straw Hat,

150
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,592
but you've left me no choice.

151
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,162
You chose to risk your life.
You gotta face the music.

you hurt my darling!

Thanks, buddy! Ya saved me.

Ahh, don't mention it, pal.

162
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,431
[MARINE HH] There are
three invaders in the plaza!

163
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,266
They're using their
Devil Fruit powers

164
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,434
to go straight over the walls!

165
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,339
Huh? Did he say "three"?

166
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,974
Could they be referring to me?

167
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,277
Or am I just being paranoid
because they said "three"?

168
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,478
No, that can't be right.

169
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,981
When would they have
learned about me?

170
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,850
I barely escaped Admiral
Aokiji's freezing attack!

171
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,988
In fact, I've barely survived
a slew of close calls!

172
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,957
It's a miracle
I've gotten this far!

173
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,827
But even down here
I'm at risk of being exposed!

174
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:50,030
Are there no safe havens
in this wretched place?

I've been spotted!

00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,622
no matter what it takes!

181
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,161
Excuse me, Fleet Admiral!

182
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:25,466
The pirates inside the bay are
beginning to swim towards us!

183
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,800
[SENGOKU]
Hmm?

184
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,608
[SENGOKU grunts]

185
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,135
[PIRATES yelling]

186
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,971
[PIRATE AA]
Come on, everybody!

187
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:07,041
Don't stop swimming
until you get to Oars!

188
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,043
[PIRATE BB]
We have to get to the plaza,

189
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,044
no matter what it takes!

190
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,682
They really think they
can get to us, huh?

191
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,917
Guard the gap and
don't let them through!

192
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,584
[MARINES]
Sir!

193
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:21,689
[PIRATES shouting]

194
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:22,890
They've got nothing to lose

195
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,925
now that we've sunk
the ice and their ships.

196
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,961
Talk about an easy target.

197
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:30,497
Now fire away while
we still have the chance!

198
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,938
[PIRATES yelling]

199
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,944
[PIRATES panting]

200
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:52,385
[PIRATES yelling]

201
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:59,927
Don't let it rattle you!
Swim, swim, swim!

202
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,295
[PIRATE CC]
We've almost made it to Oars!

203
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,671
[PIRATE DD]
Get to the plaza!

204
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,706
What? Why aren't they stopping?

205
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,576
They should've turned around
or been killed a long time ago!

206
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,945
Keep going!

207
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,473
[MARINES gasp]

208
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:59,085
[PIRATES grunting]

209
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:07,260
[MARINES gasping]

210
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,107
[PIRATES yelling]

211
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,543
[PIRATE EE]
Grab ahold and get on board!

212
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,015
[PIRATE FF]
Don't let go!

213
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,083
I-It's another pirate ship!

214
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:33,454
Sir, we have a problem! Another
coated pirate ship's about to

215
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,389
enter the bay,
and it's coming fast!

216
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,927
You've gotta be kidding me!

217
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:44,130
It must've been hidden
underwater the entire time!

218
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,567
[SENGOKU growls]

219
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,274
[PIRATES grunting]

220
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:58,311
[PIRATES shouting, cheering]

221
00:18:03,984 --> 00:18:05,752
We caught those punks off guard.

222
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,989
I never said they had
sunk all of our ships.

223
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,064
It looks like a paddle boat,

224
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,233
and it's heading straight
for us at full speed!

225
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,568
No! Whitebeard!

226
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:28,041
Now, sink that thing!
Drop it like the Moby Dick!

227
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,959
Cease fire! The ship is too
fast. Aim your fire at Oars!

228
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,561
Wha--? Oars, the giant?

229
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,296
Too late, Sengoku.

230
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,266
Everybody, ready!

231
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:02,475
[yelling]

232
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:12,119
[MARINES yelling]

233
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,387
[MARINE II]
That's insane!

234
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,923
He plucked the ship
right outta the bay!

235
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:16,990
[MARINE JJ]
This is bad.

236
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:19,459
They've broken through
the encircling walls!

237
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,629
[SENGOKU growls]

238
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:27,901
[PIRATES shouting]

239
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,672
We made it to the plaza, guys!

240
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,541
[PIRATE GG]
Ace is right there!

241
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,945
[PIRATE HH] Let's burn
their headquarters down!

242
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:41,615
[PIRATE II]
Hold on, Ace! We're coming!

243
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,683
[GARP]
Hm, impressive.

244
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,687
That space could barely
fit one ship through,

245
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,857
yet here we are with
a boat full of pirates!

246
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,925
The walls were
supposed to trap them,

247
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,728
and they might end up
trapping us instead!

248
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,732
That's enough!

249
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,301
He just won't give up.

250
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:04,938
Lucky break. We got here
right on time. Sit tight, Ace.

251
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,674
[panting]

252
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,244
Yeah, we did it!

253
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:15,682
The platform... Ace is on
the platform. We can sa--

254
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,551
[OARS JR. yells]

255
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,288
[PIRATES]
Oars, no!

256
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,491
[OARS JR. groans]

257
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:31,097
Save Ace for me, guys.
Don't let them kill him.

258
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,218
Oars, why?

259
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:21,314
[panting]

260
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,617
[AKAINU]
Huh?

261
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,729
[MARINES gasp]

262
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,933
[MARINE KK]
It's Whitebeard!

263
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:42,969
Whitebeard has
entered the plaza!

264
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:51,912
[WHITEBEARD]
My sons, please, stay back.

265
00:21:57,117 --> 00:22:01,054
[WHITEBEARD yells]

266
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:09,829
[MARINES yelling]

267
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:18,939
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

268
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:29,016
Listen up, pirates!
Bring Ace to safety!

269
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:33,387
And once you're done with
that, destroy the Navy!

270
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,960
[PIRATES shouting]

271
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:42,529
[SENGOKU]
Are ya with me, Garp?

272
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,097
[GARP]
Yeah.

273
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,503
I fear we can't
hold back any more.

274
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,739
This battle may be our last.

275
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:02,750
[LUFFY panting]

276
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:06,720
Don't worry, Ace!
I'm comin' for ya!

277
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,730
[NARRATOR]
His adoptive son within reach,

278
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:19,066
Whitebeard charges
forth undeterred

279
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,201
by the strongest warriors
the Navy has to offer.

280
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,104
With both sides swinging
between victory and defeat,

281
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,039
the battlefield
plunges into chaos.

282
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:30,243
Then Marco takes to the sky
and soars to Ace's side!

283
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:32,112
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

284
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,047
"Luffy at the End of His Tether!

285
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:37,084
An All-Out Battle
at the Oris Plaza!"

286
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:39,586
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
