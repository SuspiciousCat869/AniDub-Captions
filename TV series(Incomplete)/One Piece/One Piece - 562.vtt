WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.587
Now, you just have to find it!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.593
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.725
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.661
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:46.900
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.068
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.436
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.705
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.607
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.010
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:01.247
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.350
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.985
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.656
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.826
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.233
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.002
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:27.073
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.442
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:34.714
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.616
It is not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.218
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.921
and find themselves in the
midst of an all-out war!

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.556
After a change of plans,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.925
Hordy threatens to
crush the entire island

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.429
under the weight
of a massive ship.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:53.233
My axe will end this
once and for all!

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.779
We were too late! It's falling!

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:14.554
It's right on target, too.

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.089
[yelling]

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.191
[BOTH gasping]

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:20.059
They're all going to die!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.295
Is there nothing we can do?

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:29.402
[LUFFY] "Luffy Loses the Fight?!
Hordy's Long-Awaited Revenge!"

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.774
[laughs]

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.643
[HORDY] So he finally
gave up the ghost.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.446
Now his ability will
lose its effect.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.483
Which means the Noah's about
to come plummeting down!

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.385
This is the end, Straw Hats!

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.787
For you, and for all those

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.556
who stood in the way
of my vengeance!

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.091
What're we gonna do now?

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.893
I don't know.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:33.399
[FUKABOSHI] Surely there must
be some way to stop the ship!

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.468
[HORDY]
Perhaps.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.705
But even if you could stop it,

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.274
you would still have to
go through me first.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.809
And if memory serves,

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:45.111
that didn't work out
so well last time.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:47.313
[laughs]

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.048
We'll stop you!

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:50.550
[FUKABOSHI]
If the Noah falls,

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.119
it spells the end
for our kingdom.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.954
And the hundreds of
years that were spent

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:59.158
protecting that legendary vessel
will have been all for naught!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.627
[NEPTUNE]
Listen well, my sons.

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.330
The ship of promise, Noah,

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.900
is much more than
some ancient relic.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.039
[NEPTUNE]
Centuries ago,

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.675
a promise was made
to a great man.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.944
And for our people to
keep that promise,

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:20.780
the Noah is not to be
moved from the seafloor

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:23.015
until the time is right.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:27.320
Even today, there is still much
we do not know about this ship,

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.723
including the means by
which it was constructed.

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:36.195
And yet, until its purpose is
served, it must be protected.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.499
It will, Father. I swear.
You needn't worry.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.734
We will find out
why it was moved

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.203
and set this matter right.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.205
[FUKABOSHI] It's not enough
to save my people,

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.775
I must save the Noah as well!

00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:51.411
Poor Straw Hat.
You're fresh out of hope.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.780
Might as well just sit back
and watch the show,

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:55.615
because you and I both
know you don't have

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.717
a chance in hell of stopping me.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.019
[laughs]

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.355
What's the matter?

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.557
If you're still planning to save
those friends of yours

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.558
from a watery grave,

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.794
you'd better stop
gawking and get to it!

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.830
Or did you really give
up hope after all?

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.900
Whatever happened to that
unfounded bravado of yours?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.101
What a joke!

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.569
I'm not done!

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:20.306
I'm gonna tear that thing to
pieces before it hits land!

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:21.974
No, you mustn't do that!

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:24.577
Even if you do have enough
strength to destroy it,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.145
the Noah has a long history,

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.948
and its destined purpose
is still unfulfilled!

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.216
There's no time.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.718
You got a better way to
save the island, huh?

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.187
My friends will die!

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.556
What's more important?
That boat or your people?

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.425
It's possible that Decken
is simply unconscious.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.760
If we wake him up,

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.296
we may have just enough
time to redirect the Noah

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.497
before it's too late.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.733
And what if he's dead?
Then how are we gonna stop it?

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.502
We gotta destroy the ship!

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.071
Why can't you just stop
and think things through?

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:53.873
Not getting along, are we?

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:58.344
Well, while you're arguing, just
know, your time is running out.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.580
[laughs]

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.117
Please don't fall, Noah!

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.888
The people on Fishman Island
are very dear to me!

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:12.058
Sir Decken, if you're still
living, then please allow me

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.293
to become the Noah's
target once again!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:17.497
Have mercy on the
island, I beg of you!

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.002
I think I'll go ahead
and kill you now.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.071
I'm afraid you'll have to
witness the destruction

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:27.607
of the Ryugu Kingdom
from beyond the grave.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.075
Fishman Karate!

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:30.810
[MANBOSHI]
Shirahoshi!

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:32.411
And Sea Drums!

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.018
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Are you all right, brother?

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.253
Manboshi!

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:43.055
[HORDY laughs]

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:45.658
Don't think for a moment
I've forgotten about you.

00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:46.759
Fishman Karat--

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.427
Knock it off!

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.396
Move aside, boy!

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:53.132
[LUFFY]
Second Gear!

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.834
Gum-Gum...

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.637
Oh, Luffy, no!

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.039
Now, Jet Pistol!

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.481
Dammit.

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:11.450
The Armament Haki protects
me against punches,

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.586
but I guess this is too much.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.955
Gotta watch out for those teeth.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.729
Being underwater's not
helping me, either.

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:27.967
Only one way to beat
this guy. Now let's go!

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:42.882
[yells]

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.087
So the little coward wants
to fight me on the Noah?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.591
Right. 'Cause there's
air on the deck.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:54.393
Smart move.
But I'm still smarter.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:10:00.066
[LUFFY] If I can get in there,
I can beat him with one hit.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.169
I knew it. He's cutting through!

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:06.806
Oh, no! So sorry to burst
your bubble, Straw Hat.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:08.507
[laughs]

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.379
That's no good!

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:16.248
How am I gonna beat him
if I can't even breathe?

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:20.920
[gasps]

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:26.792
[HORDY laughing]

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.728
You humans aren't
nearly so tough

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.196
when you're out of your element.

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:34.133
You're even weaker than a fish
out of water, one might say.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.668
If you're no match for me,

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:38.504
how can you hope
to stop the Noah?

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:41.307
It's over. Just die!

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.243
No! Gum-Gum...

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.279
[LUFFY]
...Snake Shot!

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.518
Come on.

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:53.986
Do you think I'd
be stupid enough

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.856
to be hit by the
same attack twice?

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.493
So, which will be first?

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:02.194
All your companions
being crushed

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.829
under the weight of the Noah,

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.198
or you embracing
death at my hands?

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.299
I wonder.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.836
Aw, crap. If he breaks my
bubble again, I am dead!

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:14.507
This is getting old, Straw Hat!

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.212
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy!

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:22.048
[FUKABOSHI]
Sister!

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.183
Yes? What is it, Fukaboshi?

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.218
[FUKABOSHI]
Please listen carefully.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.188
Straw Hat is in your hands now.

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.423
What should I--?

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:33.659
As for me, I must
stop Hordy somehow.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:37.096
Sister, you may not
understand, but trust me.

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.365
Do not stray from the Noah.

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:42.501
No matter what
happens. All right?

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.404
Yes.

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:58.417
This is just too easy.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.519
There's no way
I can miss you now.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.088
Agh. Dammit!

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:04.457
Time to say goodbye!

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.130
[gasps] What happened?

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.431
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I'm here.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.200
Forgive me if that was rough.

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.268
[LUFFY]
Weepyhoshi. Hey!

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:20.072
Fukaboshi asked me to
help you in his stead.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.440
[LUFFY]
He's gonna fight?

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.810
This is sick. What did those
people ever do to you?

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:27.880
What kind of heartless
person values life so little?

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:28.748
Tell me!

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.750
Better heartless
than weak, right?

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.685
You three are supposed
to be the strongest

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:33.986
in the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.454
Just look at you!

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:36.622
Though, what can you expect

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.291
from the sons of that
spineless Otohime?

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:41.026
Without an ounce of
pride for her race,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.962
it's no wonder she
died like a dog

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.264
trying to get along with humans.

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.766
That's her only legacy.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:50.369
And three useless sons who
can't save their own kingdom.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:54.373
[HORDY laughing]

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:55.574
What're they doing?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.777
He's coming back this way.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.979
[FUKABOSHI]
I'm not too proud to admit:

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:02.281
Even though your power
was falsely acquired,

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.683
I wasn't strong enough
to vanquish you.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:07.653
But... still, I have hope!

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:11.824
Merman Combat...
Ultramarine Technique!

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:22.735
You still don't get it, do you?
It's a lost cause!

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:24.703
You can't even put
a scratch on me!

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:28.040
What I don't understand, Hordy,
is how you can seek to destroy

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.976
so many of your fellow men
and still feel nothing!

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.979
What is it you want
that's worth killing for?

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.215
[laughing]

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:39.652
What do you stand to gain
if Fishman Island ceases to be?

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:41.120
Stop this! Ultra...

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.288
[HORDY]
Shark Slicer!

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.456
--...Marine!
--[HORDY] Farewell.

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:47.193
[gasps]

00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:51.897
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Fukaboshi, no!

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:21.293
[gasps]

00:14:37.495 --> 00:14:40.464
[HORDY laughs]

00:14:40.498 --> 00:14:43.067
Too bad, you pitiful prince.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.671
Regardless of where it came
from, my power's quite real.

00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:52.810
Okay. All that's left now
is to get rid of you two.

00:14:52.843 --> 00:14:54.812
Damn it.

00:15:01.018 --> 00:15:04.822
Mark my words... Your ill-gotten
strength will never best me.

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:08.659
Heh. A little late
to be saying that.

00:15:08.693 --> 00:15:12.563
[FUKABOSHI]
Hordy, what's happened to you?

00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:15.733
At first, you wanted our people
to rise up against humans.

00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:18.102
This makes sense,
even if it's misguided.

00:15:18.135 --> 00:15:20.504
But now you would have
the entire population

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:24.175
of Fishman Island be
put to death instead!

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:26.243
There are people living
in the Fishman District

00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:28.479
who were once your allies!

00:15:28.512 --> 00:15:31.282
What you're doing doesn't
benefit anyone--not even you!

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:34.485
Why can't you see that, Hordy?!

00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:41.659
Is there something I don't know?

00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.694
Or is your hatred so deep

00:15:43.728 --> 00:15:47.131
that you've abandoned your
sense of reason entirely?

00:15:47.164 --> 00:15:49.233
Tell me the cause
of this madness.

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.634
Did humans attack you?

00:15:50.668 --> 00:15:53.771
Did they torment you
in some untold manner?

00:15:53.804 --> 00:15:57.108
Did they kill your friends?
Did they hurt your family?

00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.710
Did they take something
you hold dear?

00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:01.212
Answer me, damn it!

00:16:01.245 --> 00:16:05.249
What did humans do to you
that was so unforgivable?

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:09.186
Why? What in this world
could inspire such cruelty?

00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:23.067
[inaudible]

00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.186
[FUKABOSHI groans]

00:16:49.693 --> 00:16:50.995
[gasps]

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.433
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Brother! Please don't die!

00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:12.483
Seriously?

00:17:12.516 --> 00:17:16.554
Hey! Your brother
needs us! Let's go!

00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:19.490
Come on, Weepyhoshi!
Snap out of it!

00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.431
Where are we going? Hold on!

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.270
Sister, you may not
understand, but trust me.

00:17:33.304 --> 00:17:35.439
Do not stray from the Noah.

00:17:35.472 --> 00:17:38.375
No matter what
happens. All right?

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:42.012
Weepyhoshi.

00:17:42.046 --> 00:17:45.783
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:46.917
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Ca-lick.

00:17:46.951 --> 00:17:49.019
[AMMO KNIGHT A] Straw Hat Luffy,
this is the Air Tank.

00:17:49.053 --> 00:17:50.888
We've met before, remember?

00:17:50.921 --> 00:17:53.057
Oh. Yeah, hey, guys.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.024
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
We've been listening

00:17:54.058 --> 00:17:56.727
to what's happening out there.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.630
And we can see the Noah
hurtling toward the island.

00:17:59.663 --> 00:18:02.700
We've begun making the
preparations as we've discussed.

00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:05.436
So that's what Brother-hoshi
meant before.

00:18:05.469 --> 00:18:08.205
[HORDY]
I've got business there, too.

00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:09.707
What is this?

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.342
Well? Aren't you gonna go?

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:13.611
Not yet. We must be cautious.

00:18:13.644 --> 00:18:16.046
But if we don't follow
him, he'll get away!

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.849
Hordy's obviously up
to something here.

00:18:18.883 --> 00:18:20.484
And more importantly,

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.821
we have to be ready to face
him underwater again.

00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:25.022
Stay alert.

00:18:25.055 --> 00:18:26.690
[LUFFY]
So what do we do?

00:18:26.724 --> 00:18:28.425
[FUKABOSHI]
I have an idea.

00:18:29.727 --> 00:18:31.662
Hey! Where are we off to?

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.264
Brother-hoshi!

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:39.670
[AMMO KNIGHT A] Prince
Fukaboshi? What brings you here?

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.538
[FUKABOSHI] It's quite possible
that we're going to need

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:43.674
a large amount of air very soon.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:45.476
Please make arrangements for us.

00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:46.844
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Sir!

00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:48.212
I can handle this!

00:18:48.245 --> 00:18:50.748
There's supposed to be some
air on the deck, right?

00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:53.150
If I can breathe,
there's no problem!

00:18:53.183 --> 00:18:56.086
Decken needs the bubble,
that much is true.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.922
However, Hordy may
still destroy it

00:18:57.955 --> 00:18:59.990
if worst comes to worse.

00:19:00.024 --> 00:19:02.359
Take this baby
Transponder Snail.

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:03.694
This will be our last resort

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.396
in the event that
things go poorly.

00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:07.865
We must be prepared
for anything.

00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:13.704
Oh, Luffy. I don't
know what to do!

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:15.572
My brother told me that
I should protect you

00:19:15.606 --> 00:19:18.108
and to stay close to
the Noah at any cost.

00:19:18.142 --> 00:19:20.678
But I don't understand what
good that will do us now.

00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:23.647
Hang on. I think I know.

00:19:24.782 --> 00:19:25.816
Hey, guys.

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:28.686
What do we need to do to
get a little air from you?

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:31.422
[AMMO KNIGHT A] We can shoot out
all the air in the Air Tank.

00:19:31.455 --> 00:19:34.091
[LUFFY]
What is that thing for anyway?

00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:35.626
[AMMO KNIGHT A] It's an
air-conditioning facility

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:38.329
that provides air
for Fishman Island.

00:19:38.362 --> 00:19:40.764
If we create a big
bubble and shoot it,

00:19:40.798 --> 00:19:43.267
maybe it'll surround the Noah.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.804
However, the bubble would
neutralize ascending forces,

00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:50.908
so it's not going to make the
Noah stop or reverse course.

00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:53.577
On top of that, we'd have
to use all the air we've got

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.013
to make the bubble big
enough to hold the ship.

00:19:56.046 --> 00:19:59.350
And it would crash long
before we could resupply.

00:19:59.383 --> 00:20:02.052
What I mean, is we've
only got one chance.

00:20:02.086 --> 00:20:03.687
If we don't manage to
send out the bubble

00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:07.024
at the exact moment the Noah
moves closest to the Air Tank,

00:20:07.057 --> 00:20:08.826
then we're done.

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:10.260
It's over.

00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:12.262
[LUFFY]
All riding on one shot, huh?

00:20:12.296 --> 00:20:14.331
Wow. Better not miss.

00:20:14.365 --> 00:20:16.800
[AMMO KNIGHT A] Right.
I'm afraid that's all we can do.

00:20:16.834 --> 00:20:19.603
After we deploy the bubble,
the rest is up to you.

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.505
I should reiterate, this i--

00:20:21.538 --> 00:20:24.641
Don't make it more complicated.
Just go for it, okay?

00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:26.410
If I can breathe,
I'll make this work.

00:20:26.443 --> 00:20:27.911
All right, roger that.

00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:30.314
We'll do our best
not to miss the ship.

00:20:30.347 --> 00:20:33.817
And, Luffy? Everyone here
is counting on you.

00:20:33.851 --> 00:20:36.120
[HORDY]
They're swimming alongside it.

00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:38.789
You're just a lowly human
and a cowardly mermaid.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.993
What can you two possibly
hope to accomplish now?

00:20:43.027 --> 00:20:44.495
Shark Slicer!

00:20:44.528 --> 00:20:46.196
[screams]

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.898
Out of my way.

00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:50.467
[yells]

00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:52.469
Armament Hardening!

00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.705
[HORDY yells]

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:05.516
[HORDY roaring]

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.938
[laughing]

00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:32.743
[yells]

00:21:32.776 --> 00:21:35.412
No way. He got even bigger?

00:21:39.016 --> 00:21:41.251
Ready to give up?

00:21:41.285 --> 00:21:44.288
You should be, human.

00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:48.725
Just the sight of you vile worms
makes me sick to my stomach.

00:21:48.759 --> 00:21:50.794
Even if it shortens my life,

00:21:50.828 --> 00:21:54.331
and even if I have to sacrifice
everything in this world,

00:21:54.364 --> 00:21:55.966
I swear to you,

00:21:55.999 --> 00:22:00.137
I will have my revenge
against the human race.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.638
Hordy.

00:22:13.183 --> 00:22:16.386
You've only got one shot,
so you'd better not miss!

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.389
If this doesn't work,
the whole island's done for!

00:22:24.128 --> 00:22:27.531
[FUKABOSHI]
Can you hear me, Straw Hat?

00:22:27.564 --> 00:22:29.433
Oh, dear. That's my
brother's voice!

00:22:29.466 --> 00:22:32.436
Hey, buddy. Are you okay?

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:40.811
[FUKABOSHI] I'm barely alive.
But please, listen.

00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:46.350
He spoke earlier, and--

00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:53.323
It's clear now. Hordy is--

00:22:54.558 --> 00:23:00.564
[laughing]

00:23:14.044 --> 00:23:15.712
[NARRATOR] The Straw
Hats continue their battle

00:23:15.746 --> 00:23:17.080
with the Fishman Pirates,

00:23:17.114 --> 00:23:19.616
having faith that Luffy
will carry out his mission.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.852
Neptune's Army aids them
in their struggle,

00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:24.188
finally accepting
the crew as allies.

00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:27.524
As the fight continues,
Fukaboshi's Transponder Snail

00:23:27.558 --> 00:23:30.260
reveals the sober truth
behind Hordy's motivations

00:23:30.294 --> 00:23:32.262
to all of Fishman Island.

00:23:32.296 --> 00:23:33.997
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:37.834
"A Shocking Fact!
The True Identity of Hordy!"

00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:40.404
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
