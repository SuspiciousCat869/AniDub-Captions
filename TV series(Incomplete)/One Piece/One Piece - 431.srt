00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,533
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,285
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,579
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,581
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,542
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,211
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,546
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,008
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,719
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,304
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,014
of the World Government,

48
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:05,268
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,520
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,440
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:14,027
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,528
the crew will
cut a path across

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,073
the Grand Line
to the New World!

54
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,536
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

55
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,414
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother Ace.

56
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,709
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison Impel Down.

57
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,004
Forming an unlikely alliance
with Buggy the Clown,

58
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,215
Luffy heads to the second
level of the prison:

59
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,550
the Floor of
Wild Beasts from Hell.

60
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,179
There, he encounters Mr. 3,
a former Baroque Works agent

61
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,266
and continues his descent
alongside his unwilling allies.

Jimbei. Ace. Look.

Do you get it?

68
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,449
This world is full of dozens
of second placers.

69
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,618
Silver medalists
who could never defeat

70

all holding back their tears.

[CHUBBY GUARD]
What happened here?

Look at the size
of this hole!

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,542
It's so big, even the Sphinx
could've fallen through it!

looking for?

know how they got the keys,

Don't tell me Straw Hat
and his friends did this.

Fleet Admiral Sengoku
himself just sent word to us.

[OUTSIDE GUARD] Little did
we know, Monkey D. Luffy,

and our condemned prisoner

00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,285

have more in common

113
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,912
than the D in their names.

to stop the public execution?!

Break in and make it out
with his brother

119

before we
can transport him?

[OUTSIDE GUARD]
What else could it be?

121
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,758
[UNSEEN GUARD] That would
explain why he keeps going down.

122
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,927
We were so focused on
Whitebeard's attack,

123
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,553
we let him sneak inside.

to pull this off,

gonna break loose!

the future of the sea.

Yet that troublemaking

This is the world itself!

Do you realize how strong
our organization is?

Do you realize how devoted
we are to capturing her?

If that's Robin's enemy,
then I know what to do.

This is my new weapon,

a massive slingshot by
the name of Kabuto!

Behold its awesome power!

We haven't had
a single breakout

in Impel Down in
the past 20 years!

was the last.

from the inside
or the outside!

[SENGOKU] Impel Down is
more than a prison.

It's a symbol of
unyielding justice

he's the grandson of a Marine!

180
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,930
I should've known better
than to trust that fool.

181
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,099
Man's one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea,

182
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,393
what do you expect?

183
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,602
What I wanna know is how

184
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,022
he was able to get through
the defenses we've got set up.

185
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,358
You think he flew in?

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,943
[SENGOKU growls]
That's enough!

187
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,069
If you weren't known

188
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,738
all over the Grand Line
as the hero of the Navy, Garp.

189
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,951
I'd make you take responsibility
for your family myself!

190
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,578
[laughing]

191
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,746
Go ahead, lock me
up, execute me.

192
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,998
It won't change a thing!

193
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,416
Nothing, you hear me?

194
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,710
[laughing]
It's too late!

195
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,461
[SENGOKU]
Laugh it up while you can.

196
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,463
But a blow like this
to our reputation

197
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,382
will have serious
repercussions.

198
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,551
Tsuru and I have tried to
keep this under wraps.

199
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,970
But there's only
so much we can do!

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,430
[GARP]
Hey! Those are mine, dammit!

201
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,431
No fair!

202
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,141
Shut up already!

[BUGGY and LUFFY]
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

207
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,424
[LUFFY] This floor feels
like a frying pan!

[LUFFY panting]

209
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,605
So are we in the desert?

210
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,482
It's hot.

211
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,817
Why's it so quiet?

Oh, how I never
wanted to end up here.

[BUGGY grunting]

216
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,618
Straw Hat! If I have
to go to one more

217
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,495
crappy place with you,
I'll lose my mind!

[LUFFY]
Huh. He's takin' a cat nap.

219
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,332
Oh, that's real funny!

220
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,587
This place is especially
bad for someone like me.

221
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm a Wax Man, after all.

222
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,730
Big place!

223
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,649
So where are the stairs down?

224
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,696
Haven't a clue.

225
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,574
Your buddy here's gonna melt
if we don't get moving soon.

226
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,493
Well alright, then off we go.

[LUFFY panting]

228
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:54,880
On second thought,

229
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,633
maybe we should've
just sat down and died.

230
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,510
Don't waste your
energy complaining.

231
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,138
I won't carry you
if you collapse.

Hey, look!
It's grilled chicken time!

234
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,812
That is not natural.

235
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,440
A hummingbird fluttered
down from above.

236
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,567
It was grilled
in the open air.

237

[BOTH]
How hot is it here?

238
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,489
This is good!
You're missin' out!

00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,908
[MR. 3, BUGGY]
No thank you.

240
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,536
[LUFFY] I wish I could eat
that lion from upstairs.

241
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,538
I bet this heat
could barbeque him.

That thing talked like a human!

243
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,583
Are you serious?

[MR. 3]
At this rate.

What, the jail
cells? Who cares?

How thick-headed
can you get, kid?

249
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,599
We can hide from
the sun inside there!

250
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,560
And we might find prisoners
who can lead us to the stairs!

251
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,979
Whoa, I didn't think of that!
Man, you're the smartest!

Damn straight, I am! Hey, Mr.3!

[LUFFY giggles]

255
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,740
I'm afraid there's
just no place to hide.

me where the--

[MR. 3] A miserable sight
if I've ever seen one.

00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,254
You wouldn't think
looking at them now,

259
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,798
but the prisoners on this floor

260
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,175
were all hardened criminals
commanding bounties

261
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,261
of over
50 million berries.

262
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,722
Beneath here is
the Burning Heat Hell,

cooking the ground.

264
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,935
Also, these men are
deprived of food and water,

leaving them half dead.

former selves.

Yes. Now you know
why this floor is covered

with what appears to be sand.

Oh no.

Alas. Yes.

Chances are what you're
standing on are the remains

of prisoners who have
completely dried up.

[MR. 3] If we remain
in this place too long,

00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,982
we'll become sand
beneath someone's feet

277
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,609
just like they did.

00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,154

while we have
the sweat to spare.

Okay. Then let's go
to Level 4 already.

[BUGGY]
Not that way!

the stairs on the left!

We do?

take the pass on the right.
