"That feeling" I get when embarking

they capture the
unwanted attention

Luffy, who had been poisoned
by Warden Magellan,

was injected with
a Healing Hormone from Ivankov,

him of ten years of his life.

00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,840
Hm?

177
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,975
D-D-D-D--!

178
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,844
"Dad"?!

179
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,514
[ALL]
Dragon's your dad?!

180
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,549
[IVANKOV]
What?!

181
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,919
[IVANKOV groaning]

182
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:08,124
Your dear papa...
and I never knew!

183
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,592
Goodness!

184
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,764
D-D-D-Don't be ridiculous!

185
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,866
Dragon doesn't have
any children!

186
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,635
That's just crazy talk!

187
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:22,738
Huhh. Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

188
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,041
Ah, whatever.

189
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,009
Grandpa didn't keep it a secret.

190
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,814
[GARP]
The name of your father

191
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:35,651
is Monkey D. Dragon,
the revolutionary.

192
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,889
I don't really know
that much about him.

193
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,791
I've never even seen
his face before.

194
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,025
What?!

195
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,960
[IVANKOV]
But wait, this might be legit!

196
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,296
He doesn't come across as the
kind of person who would lie,

197
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,199
and he is a rather impressive
pirate, in his own way.

198
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,703
Plus, the vitality he's shown
is the stuff of legends.

199
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,173
An extraordinary father
and an extraordinary son!

200
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,975
Please, tell me,
where did you come from?

201
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,243
Huh? The East Blue.

202
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,678
[IVANKOV gasps]

203
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:06,549
Say, Dragon.

204
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,616
[DRAGON]
Hm?

205
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,319
When you step out for air,
you always seem to face

206
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:13,189
in the same direction,
no matter where we go.

207
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,757
Do I?

208
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,794
Huh, I suppose I never
gave it much thought.

209
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,263
Bit strange that you would
bring it up, isn't it?

210
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:25,034
Well, I wondered if it was
some sort of homing instinct.

211
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,636
You know, the same
thing animals have.

212
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:33,876
Thinking of home? Perhaps some
family in the east. Maybe?

213
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,314
That's enough. Don't stick
your nose in my past.

214
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,282
[IVANOV]
Ha-ha. As you wish.

215
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,153
[IVANKOV]
Hang on. Oh, no!

216
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,722
If Straw Hat Boy
really is Dragon's son,

217
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,557
this could be a disaster!

218
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:53,763
Inazuma, check to see when
they're taking Ace Boy away!

219
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,131
Yes, of course.

220
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:56,699
There isn't much time.

221
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:57,933
The Vivre Card
was pointing down,

222
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,804
which means he's still here
and still alive, thank goodness.

223
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,672
Get me that info
as soon as possible.

224
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,242
I'm heading to Level 6
with Straw Hat Boy right now.

225
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,613
Yeah? You're really
gonna show me the way?!

226
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,884
Hey, wait, you just said
Level 6. I thought Ace was on 5.

227
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,987
Actually, you're already
below Level 5.

228
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,056
Okay, whatever.
All right! Let's go!

229
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,793
[IVANKOV]
I wasn't paying attention.

230
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,661
It didn't occur to me before!

231
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:28,164
If Straw Hat Boy is
Dragon's son as he claims,

232
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,966
then that means so is Ace!

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,703
Is this why the Navy captured
him and planned his execution?

234
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:38,707
But that's ludicrous!
Not to mention suicidal!

235
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:39,942
There's no way
they'd pick a fight

236
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,711
with Whitebeard and
Dragon at the same time!

237
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,815
What does the World Government
hope to gain from all this?!

238
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,954
[IVANKOV] In any case, I have
no choice but to make my move!

239
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,257
Bon, rest. I'll be
back later, okay?

240
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,761
[IVANKOV]
Straw Hat Boy!

241
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,664
Listen closely. You need
to keep that a secret.

242
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,967
Do not let people know
that Dragon's your father.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,169
Yeah, I just figured that out.

244
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,704
I'm his dear friend,

245
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:11,106
as well as one of his
trusted commanders.

246
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,108
That means I'm a revolutionary.

247
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,244
That's the reason
I was arrested.

248
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,881
So, it's my duty to help you,
whether you like it or not!

249
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:19,849
I can't just stand around

250
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,385
and let my friend's son
die before my eyes!

251
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,922
Listen up! Tell everyone
in the New Kama Land!

252
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,090
We're going to move fast

253
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,426
and rescue Ace Boy
before his execution.

254
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,428
And then, we'll
break out of Impel Down!

255
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,063
Does everyone understand?

256
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,031
--[CROWD gasping]
--It's so sudden!

257
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,433

comes without warning!

If you're prepared to fight,
then be prepared to die!

262
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,878

and wait for our return!

wherever you lead, Iva!

This is a new beginning

267
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,321
for the people of New Kama Land!

[CROWD gasping]

279
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,045
Just fine.

280

[CROWD]
That's not funny!

281
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,214
But the treatment
he went through

00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:00,382
to cure Magellan's poison

283
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,319
was harsh and
shortened his lifespan.

284
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:06,322
It's only natural he's still
an eensy bit pooped.

you're gonna feel the side
effects several days from now,

it won't really matter.

mention it in our reports.

Mr. 2 just waltzed them
into the Freezing Hell

304

and that was the last
you saw of them?

00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,185
[GUARD A]
Yes, that's right.

306
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,087
His disguise was perfect, sir.

307
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,522
We searched for them,
but all we could find

308
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,924
was that headdress
covered in blood.

309
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,992
From the lack of remains,

310
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:19,461
we assume that they took
Straw Hat out of the cell,

311
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,930
but were eaten up
by the wolves afterward.

312
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,767
[sighs] I see.

313
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,468
Look at me, sitting in
the warden's chair,

314
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:28,804
wearing his special
order headpiece thing

315
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,806
and yet I feel so empty.

316
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,974
You know why?

317
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,143
'Cause I haven't earned it
until I've crushed Magellan.

318
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,811
Right, good luck with that.

319
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,814
And let me remind you, if we
get tricked or beaten again,

320
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:42,184
not only the warden's job, but
your job will be on the line.

a lot easier this time!

somewhere else!

lap! Let's pick it up, partner!

347
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,228
[BUGGY]
Oh, crap!

348
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,530
[MR. 3] The guards will
see us for sure now.

349
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,832
[BUGGY] We're right
in ihis line of sight!

350
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,169
[BOTH sigh]

351
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,138
[BOTH]
That was a close one.

352
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:12,174
[BOTH sneeze]

353
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,477
You're late, sir.

354
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
[MAGELLAN sighs]

355
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:19,548
And you're strict, Domino.

356
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:23,018
Try to empty your bowels
faster next time.

357
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,119
Not possible.

358
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,021
[stomach grumbles]

359
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,056
[groaning] Not again!

360
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,558
You'll have to hold it in.

361
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:30,526
I can't!

362
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,995
We need to be at the
front gate at 9 AM sharp

363
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,130
to officially transfer
the prisoner.

364
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:37,366
That is the mission
placed before us.

365
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,934
If we don't make it in time,

366
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,503
we'll ruin the reputation
of Impel Down.

367
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,938
[groans]

368
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,310
All right, listen up.

369
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:51,346
Our mission is to take custody
of Portgas D. Ace,

370
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,150
and then transfer him to the
Marineford Navy Headquarters.

371
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,151
Got it?

372
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,253
Until the moment that we
hand over that prisoner,

373
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,255
I need each and every
one of you on full alert!

374
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,924
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

375
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,193
[ONIGUMO] So that we're ready
for any possibility,

376
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,395
we're moving him
in a convoy of five ships

377
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:09,198
under the direction
of five Vice Admirals.

378
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,667
We cannot afford a single
slip up! Understood?

379
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,601
[MARINES]
Sir!

380
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:18,640
[LUFFY yelling]

381
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:24,213
[LUFFY] I don't know why,
but I got a crap ton of energy!

382
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,948
Good, you're going to need it.

383
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:27,950
We can't afford
to waste even a second.

384
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:30,552
There's no security here,
so flex those leg muscles

385
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,088
and run like crazy,
Straw Hat Boy!

386
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,390
Nothing can stop us! Go!

387
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,160
[LUFFY yelling]

388
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,428
[growls]

389
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,732
Hey, what's going on over there?

390
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,967
[PRISONER B]
Huh?

391
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,003
[PRISONER A]
Who are those weirdos?

392
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:51,273
Ivankov? No way!
I thought he was dead!

393
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,375
No, it can't be!

394
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:59,381
[ARMY WOLVES growling]

395
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:01,450
[LUFFY]
Outta my way!

396
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,485
No time for you!

397
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,354
[ARMY WOLVES whining]

398
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:08,323
[IVANKOV]
Death Wink!

399
00:20:08,357 --> 00:20:10,058
[ARMY WOLVES whining]

400
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:13,028
Inazuma, open it up!

401
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,062
[INAZUMA]
Right!

402
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,636
They'll be monitoring us
from now on.

403
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,537
Who cares? Let 'em come!

404
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,442
[alarm]

405
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,610
[GUARD C]
We have intruders!

406
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,611
[GUARDS yelping]

407
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,712
[GUARD C] They're running
down the staircase

408
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,648
between Level 5 and 6!

409
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,284
Wait, the guy with the big head!

410
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,387
He's that "Queen of the Queers"
that went missing years ago!

411
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,621
Name's Ivankov.

412
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,056
[GUARDS gasping]

413
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,758
[GUARD C]
Where's he been hiding?

414
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,627
We gave up on that guy ages ago!

415
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,263
[GUARD D] The one running next
to him is Straw Hat Luffy.

416
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,765
I thought the warden
took care of him,

417
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,167
but he looks as healthy as ever.

418
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,469
[GUARD C] The third one is
another missing prisoner!

419
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,506
Inazuma! A revolutionary
from the South Blue!

420
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,408
What the hell is goin' on?

421
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,576
[GUARD F] Looks like they're
heading straight for Level 6!

422
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,679
[GUARD G] I think they're trying
to save "Fire Fist" Ace!

423
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:06,114
Domino and Warden Magellan
are also on their way

424
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,517
to Level 6 for the
transfer as we speak.

425
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,086
They're all gonna
bump into each other!

426
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,788
How can they all still be alive?

427
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,524
[GUARD C] Vice Warden,
when'd you get here?

428
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,226
[growls] Activate the
passageway traps immediately.

429
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,663
Call all the jailers on Level 6.
Tell them to get ready.

430
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,699
They'll need to stand their
ground until Mistress Sadie

431
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:25,834
and the Demon Guards arrive
as reinforcements.

432
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,402
Report everything
that's going on

433
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,237
to all floors and
Warden Magellan.

434
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,441
[HANNYABAL] You have
your orders! Get moving!

435
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:33,809
[GUARDS]
Right! Yes, sir!

436
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,846
[GUARD C] I've never seen the
Vice Warden so serious before!

437
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,415
Maybe it's the imposter again.

438
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:43,151
We have to stop
these troublemakers.

439
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,354
Since I can't blame
the warden for this one, I mean.

440
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,190
[GUARD C]
Uhh! Nope! He's the real deal.

441
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,528
We can make it! We can make it!

442
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,198
[GUARDS panting]

443
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,166
--[LUFFY grunts]
--[GUARDS yelping]

444
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,304
Hang on, Ace!
I'm comin' for you!

445
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:51,887
[MAGELLAN]
This is it, Portgas D. Ace.

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,256
You're going to be
transferred to Marineford.

447
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,924
Upon your arrival there,

448
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,294
you will be taken
to the execution grounds.

449
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:04,866
[NARRATOR] "The public
execution of Ace is in...

450
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,835
...6 hours."

451
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:16,678
[NARRATOR] Luffy finally reaches
the lowest level of Imepl Down,

452
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,713
the legendary Level 6.

453
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,482
Unfortunately, he finds
that his brother

454
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,384
has already been taken away.

455
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,920
Desperate to catch Ace
before he leaves the prison,

456
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,088
Luffy makes chase,

457
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:29,424
but is stopped dead in his
tracks by Hannyabal's trap.

458
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,226
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

459
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,928
"Ace's Convoy Begins.

460
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,630
Battle on the Lowest
Floor, Level 6!"

461
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,799
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
