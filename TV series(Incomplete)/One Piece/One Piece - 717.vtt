00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.515
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.420
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:45.565
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.969
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.376
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.280
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.785
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.558
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.899
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.196
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.099
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.442
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.481
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.354
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.491
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.796
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.967
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.873
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:46.352
[DIAMANTE]
Death Enjambre!

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.262
[KYROS screams]

00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.701
Father, no!

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:58.309
[DIAMANTE cackles]
The sky is fallin', Kyros!

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:00.480
I bet you wouldn't have
stumbled if you still had

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:03.053
that extra leg
right about now, huh?

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:04.523
You bastard!

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.428
I will never forgive you
for this, Diamante!

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:10.869
[cackles] Fine!
Then don't forgive me!

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.006
Come make me pay!

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.409
You want a piece?

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.446
I got a bullet for ya!

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.151
Just like your mommy.

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:23.392
This is my fight!

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.405
Ten years you have
suffered on your own.

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:34.616
For ten years you've
upheld your mother's wish.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.557
Though you've fought
in the Colosseum,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.428
you still haven't harmed a soul!

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.304
Your hands are still clean.

00:04:45.337 --> 00:04:47.073
They're untainted!

00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:51.850
[KYROS]
Your mother's heart...

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:56.893
...resides in those
pristine hands.

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:03.473
[REBECCA]
Mother.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:08.216
So I will not allow
for you to stain them

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.588
with this louse's blood!

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:12.758
[gasps]

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.067
[gasps]

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.479
From now on, you will
live your life peacefully!

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:33.567
[LUFFY] "Trueno Bastardo!
Kyros' Furious Strike!"

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:36.941

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.978
[DIAMANTE groans]

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.480
[grunts]

00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:43.754
What horse crap!

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:47.628
No one's ever moved around
in my deadly stardust!

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.139
[DIAMANTE yells]

00:05:56.211 --> 00:05:58.584
What the hell?

00:05:58.617 --> 00:06:00.220
How are you standing?

00:06:00.254 --> 00:06:02.725
Are you solid steel?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.676
Come on. No matter how you act,
I know this hurts you.

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:17.154
[DIAMANTE] You're crazy.
No, I take that back.

00:06:17.188 --> 00:06:19.559
You're just stupid.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.577
--[KYROS] This pain...
--[DIAMANTE] Huh?

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.317
...is proof that I am human!

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:36.993
You wouldn't understand,
you monster!

00:06:38.095 --> 00:06:43.540
This is nothing compared to
the grief of being forgotten!

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.914
Scarlet!

00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:50.320
[KYROS] Damn it!
Why didn't you wait for me?

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:52.558
Why are you here?

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:55.765
[KYROS]
I see now.

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:59.840
It seems I've been erased
from everyone's memories.

00:06:59.873 --> 00:07:06.019
Our promises.
Our time together. Gone.

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:08.590
Scarlet! Stay with me!

00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:14.969
[SCARLET] I have a favor
to ask of you, stranger.

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:21.750
My daughter is hungry and
she's waiting for me. Please.

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:24.756
It's Kyros! I'm your husband!

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:26.559
I beg you--

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:35.176
[KYROS sobs]

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.717
[KYROS]
Scarlet!

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.724
[KYROS]
How did it come to this?

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:46.165
I've lost her,
she's gone. This is hell!

00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:50.574
[KYROS]
These useless tin arms of mine.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:54.916
I can't even feel
your warmth one last time!

00:07:56.987 --> 00:08:04.000
[KYROS]
Scarlet!

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:16.560
You'll never be able to
grasp the unbearable ache

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:19.999
of being unable to
feel anything you touch!

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:21.301
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:25.844
[KYROS] Compared to
all the despicable acts

00:08:25.878 --> 00:08:28.751
you committed against
the people of Dressrosa,

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:33.225
what I suffer now
is scarcely pain at all!

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:38.871
If I'm "solid" anything...

00:08:39.772 --> 00:08:45.316
...then I am this kingdom's
"solid" rage, manifested.

00:08:47.822 --> 00:08:50.627
Here to collect payback!

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:55.871
[DIAMANTE]
How is he still moving?

00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:59.846
[gasps] You were in your
prime two decades ago!

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.852
You should have peaked by now!

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:10.266
Don't overlook my
sword skills. You fool!

00:09:14.374 --> 00:09:17.247
Half Moon Glaive!

00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:21.289
[KYROS grunts]

00:09:21.322 --> 00:09:23.492
Die, Kyros!

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:26.265
Diamante!

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.423
[VIOLET gasps]

00:09:38.456 --> 00:09:39.826
Did you see something?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.265
How are they doing? Viola?

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:46.371
Rebecca is alive and well.

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:52.217
But this battle is very intense.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.856
Even just watching, I'm shaken.

00:09:56.693 --> 00:10:00.934
[VIOLET] I can feel
Kyros' pain and anger.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.239
You ready to call it
curtains, yet?

00:10:03.272 --> 00:10:05.944
I'll show you to your grave!

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.182
[yells]

[DIAMANTE cackles]

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:30.092
Feeling a little weak
in the knee? Poor Kyros.

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:35.236
[DIAMANTE] Looks like my
"metal rain" cleared up.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.742
[panting]

00:10:37.776 --> 00:10:39.378
[DIAMANTE]
I suppose it's more fitting

00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:42.484
if I finish you off myself.

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:44.387
Just like I did with Scarlet!

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.629
And I bet you
miss her, don't you?

00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.097
[gasps]

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.517
[DIAMANTE cackles]

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.656
So cruel. He keeps
taunting them.

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:04.696
Laughing about Scarlet's death.

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:07.433
Like rubbing salt in a wound!

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:12.344
[GUARD 717A]
I'm sorry! King Riku!

00:11:12.377 --> 00:11:14.181
Our search has ended in vain.

00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:17.220
A man named Diamante
got ahead of our party.

00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:23.232
Scarlet was found in the town,
but she was killed by gunshot.

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:28.711
[VIOLET]
You killed Scarlet?

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:32.552
Oh yeah? That was
your older sister, huh?

00:11:32.585 --> 00:11:34.421
It's such a shame
she had to go and

00:11:34.454 --> 00:11:36.626
buy food at the market today.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:38.597
If she could've
controlled her hunger,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.534
she wouldn't have been killed!

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.772
What a greedy sow!

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:44.876
[VIOLET]
Tank, let go of me!

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:48.316
Please don't act in haste!
You must think rationally.

00:11:48.349 --> 00:11:50.253
Just let me go!

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:54.562
Hear me out. We must
stay in the palace!

00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:56.199
It's for your own protection!

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.333
[gasps]

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:10.393
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:14.067
[DIAMANTE]
You. And you!

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.973
Your bloodline ends right here.

00:12:17.006 --> 00:12:21.481
What you don't realize is that
you lost to us a decade ago!

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:23.787
Losers should
accept their defeat.

00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:27.026
You're only delaying
the inevitable!

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:34.375
You don't know how this ends!

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:39.385
My next strike is strong enough
to shatter the earth!

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:42.558
[yells]

00:12:42.592 --> 00:12:44.528
Take this!

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:48.536
And this!

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.483
Think that wounded leg can dodge
what I am about to throw at you?

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:59.023
I will not dodge a thing!

00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:01.428
If you're not gonna
avoid my attack,

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:04.300
then you're just a damn fool!

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:09.244
Do not belittle me, cur!

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:12.250
This sword contains
ten years of pain

00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:15.190
amassed from myself
and Dressrosa!

get patched up.

your mother's life.

But I'll devote mine to protect
yours whatever the cost!

Someday. Happiness
will return to you.

Until then,
I'll stay right here!

Is it bad?

Please don't tell me the
Commander has fallen in battle.

But how is Kyros though?
Does he still live?

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.098
He lives. Kyros is
injured but safe.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.768
And Rebecca, too!

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:51.709
It's thanks to Nico Robin
that she survived.

00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:54.682
It's unbelievable
that he took out

00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.287
the top Don Quixote Executives.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.259
And the Colosseum hero at that.

00:18:00.292 --> 00:18:01.595
[TOWNSMAN 717C gasps]
Is that a joke?

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:03.298
You must have
forgotten that Kyros

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.572
was the original
undefeated champion!

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:10.780
[TOWNSMAN 717B] We truly thought
the Don Quixote Family

00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:14.354
was invincible. But here they
are dropping one after another.

00:18:14.387 --> 00:18:18.896
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.138
He did well.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.478
That's our Commander!

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:33.458
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:38.435
Now, the tables are turning
in our favor at last.

00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:41.041
The warriors recruited
by the Straw Hat Pirates

00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:43.580
have taken down the
lower-ranking Executives

00:18:43.613 --> 00:18:45.482
one after another.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:50.527
There's only four major players
of the Don Quixote Family left.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:53.165
[VIOLET]
Bellamy the Hyena.

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:55.671
Then two high-ranking
Executives.

00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:57.908
Pica and Trebol.

00:18:57.941 --> 00:18:59.712
After that...

00:18:59.746 --> 00:19:02.183
Only the current King
and Warlord of the Sea,

00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:05.023
Doflamingo remains.

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:08.630
That's it. Our final hurdle!

00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:12.504
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:14.541
[TOWNSMAN 717D] I never thought
they'd get this far.

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:16.812
[TOWNSMAN 717E] These Straw-Hat
people are amazing!

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.583
[TOWNSMAN 717F]
I can't believe we tried to kill

00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:22.356
these magnificent bastards
in an attempt to save ourselves.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.329
Well, there's no use crying
over spilt milk, right?

00:19:25.362 --> 00:19:28.035
Plus, you guys are saying such
nice stuff about us now.

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:31.274
I can't stay mad
at you. [laughs]

00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:35.683
Hm? Old King Riku?
Where ya going, your Highness?

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:39.024
[DOLDO] I do not believe my life
is threatened any longer.

00:19:39.057 --> 00:19:40.660
I'm going to town.

00:19:40.693 --> 00:19:43.599
There's still much
left to be done.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.337
Allow me to escort you, sir!

00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:49.778
I have very little faith in
the Government or the Navy!

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:52.918
[TOWNSMAN 717G] Everyone's
feeling helpless right now.

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:57.694
They think there's no escaping
the sick game, or the Birdcage.

00:19:57.727 --> 00:19:59.264
[TOWNSMAN 717H]
I say, we all go!

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:00.834
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.437
[TOWNSMAN 717H]
Let's spread a message of hope

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.541
throughout the kingdom!

00:20:09.317 --> 00:20:10.687
It seems we have
finally captured

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:12.691
what one would call
a "breather."

00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:14.561
[USOPP laughs]

00:20:14.595 --> 00:20:19.705
Huh? Hey, where did that one
Navy Admiral guy go anyway?

00:20:19.738 --> 00:20:21.843
Did you not take note,
Sir Usopp?

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:25.683
That decorated fellow
traveled into town a while ago.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.794
Well, get to it then.
What's the report?

00:20:30.827 --> 00:20:34.535
The capture of "out of control"
citizens is proceeding well.

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:37.507
But we still have
quite a bit on our plate.

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:39.913
[FUJITORA] In that case,
gather up all the civilians

00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:42.350
you can into one place.

00:20:42.384 --> 00:20:45.256
Make certain it's secure.

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.227
We will keep them all safe.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.495
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:07.200
[ZORO grunts]
Ripple!

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:08.503
[gasps]

00:21:10.439 --> 00:21:13.980
[ZORO]
Flash! Tower Climb!

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:15.149
[gasps]

00:21:15.182 --> 00:21:16.886
[ZORO]
Tower Climb Return!

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:22.330
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:26.070
Two-Sword Style. Nigiri!

00:21:35.355 --> 00:21:38.830
[PICA cackles]

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:40.499
[PICA]
Roronoa Zoro.

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:42.871
I no longer have time for you.

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:45.175
There's something
I need to do now.

00:21:45.209 --> 00:21:46.512
Not again!

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:49.718
I won't let you leave
whenever you feel like it!

00:21:54.996 --> 00:21:56.497
The hell?

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.474
[ZORO]
That bastard.

00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:07.087
Hey, Father.
What's that shaking?

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.388
[gasps]

00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:11.361
[REBECCA, KYROS gasp]

00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:12.998
[screams]

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:14.635
[KYROS]
Rebecca!

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.977
[ROBIN] No! I thought
Zoro had him!

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.680
That's Pica!

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:23.485
[gasps]

00:22:29.832 --> 00:22:33.606
Oh, Diamante.
That's a real bad look

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.812
for a top Executive
in our Family.

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:16.525
[NARRATOR]
Abandoning his fight with Zoro,

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.563
Pica heads for
the King's Plateau.

00:23:18.596 --> 00:23:21.468
Effortlessly evading many
challengers along the way,

00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:24.240
he dives underground
with one thing on his mind:

00:23:24.273 --> 00:23:25.610
to kill King Riku.

00:23:25.643 --> 00:23:27.379
Zoro, struggling to catch up,

00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:30.185
must devise a creative
solution to stop him.

00:23:30.219 --> 00:23:32.089
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.123 --> 00:23:33.693
"Moving Across the Ground!

00:23:33.726 --> 00:23:36.732
The Giant Statue
Pica's Surprise Maneuver!"

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:39.905
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
