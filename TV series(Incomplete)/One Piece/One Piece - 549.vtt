WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.725
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:41.628
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:46.866
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.035
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.068 --> 00:02:50.403
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.672
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.574
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.976
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.679
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.350
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.919
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.622
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.565
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:21.334
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:25.004
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.373
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:31.844
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:33.780
It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:35.848
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.818
This will be destroyed,
and quickly.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:43.523
We'll rebuild it from scratch,
but with a new king...

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.091
...like me!

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.527
Citizens of Fishman Island!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.297
The old Ryugu Kingdom
has worn out its welcome.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.767
Time to say goodbye!

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:58.071
In three hours,
at the Conchcorde Plaza,

00:03:58.104 --> 00:04:02.442
the weak and incompetent King
Neptune will be put to death!

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.343
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.846
Straw Hat, I know you're there.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.283
I have something that
may be of interest to you.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.218
As you watch from
wherever you are,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.621
I want you to know that
this is just the beginning

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:19.058
of my revenge for what
you did to Arlong. Enjoy.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.928
Aw, man! He even captured Zoro?

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.463
Why'd we leave them alone?

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.232
But still, all three?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.202
[BROOK, USOPP]
It's water!

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.904
[HORDY] By the time we
finish the King's execution,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.141
that room will be
completely flooded.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.711
[HORDY] You lowly
humans can't survive that,

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.347
if I'm not mistaken. Too bad.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.816
[LUFFY] Hey, shark!
Take me back to the palace!

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.617
Sha!

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.586
[JIMBEI]
Luffy! I told you to wait!

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:47.287
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.221
[JIMBEI]
You don't get it.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.490
You people have no
business fighting Hordy!

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.926
You're wrong! Not when
my crew's in trouble!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.428
It's not that I don't trust you,

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.563
but this fight is
personal for me, too.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:04:59.098
Such a stubborn fool!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.234
Would you shut up already?

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:04.203
If you don't want me
to go, then stop me.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:06.139
[JIMBEI]
Since we were allies before,

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:09.008
I had hoped that you
would honor my request.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.844
How easily I forget who you are.

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.048
Hard-headedness truly
does run in your family.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:18.685
Stand down, Luffy...

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.288
...or else.

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:29.195
[LUFFY] "A Rift Opens Up!
Luffy vs. Jimbei!"

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.476
Have I told you
what people called me?

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.379
I was "The Submarine
of the East Blue"!

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:49.615
That's 'cause I could swim an
82-foot pool in no time at all!

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.951
[BROOK laughs]
Eighty-two feet?

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.253
I could run over
a pool that tiny.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.690
That's one advantage to being
a skeleton. I'm light as air!

00:05:58.758 --> 00:05:59.659
[USOPP]
Y'know what?

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.993
We should have a race
one of these days

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:02.662
to see which one
of us is faster!

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:04.364
Anytime you're in
the mood to lose,

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:06.733
I'll be more than happy
to let you eat my dust!

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.135
[USOPP, BROOK laughing]

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.304
[BROOK] That is,
if we ever get out of here!

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.239
[USOPP] Yeah, this is
not looking good for us!

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:18.544
[BROOK, USOPP shouting]

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:19.946
Shut up!

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.080
[USOPP, BROOK yelling]

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.482
Hey, how is it you can sit there

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.417
with your eyes closed
like nothing's going on?

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.221
Oh, I know! You must be coming
up with a plan to set us free!

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:28.988
Nope.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.156
Ya couldn't have lied?

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.527
He'll be honest to the
bitter end. Wow. [laughs]

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.629
Everything'd be fine
if I had a sword.

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:38.931
I don't think that's true.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:41.467
[BROOK]
Things have gotten bleak.

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:45.004
I didn't want to do this
in front of you, but so be it.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.706
Uhh... do what exactly?

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:50.143
[BROOK chanting]

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:53.279
[BROOK]
Bone, bone, bone, bone...

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.915
Okay, Brook, you're really
starting to freak me out here!

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:59.419
...bone, bone, bone, bone...

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:02.221
Stop! That's enough!

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.992
[BROOK]
Bone!

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.331
Ka-Boom!

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:13.332
And I'm out!

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.568
[BROOK laughs]

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.370
[ZORO gasps]

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.005
[shrieks]

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.873
[BROOK]
Well, good luck, you guys!

00:07:20.907 --> 00:07:22.108
[USOPP]
Wait a damn second!

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.242
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.411
You're just gonna leave
without explaining or anything?

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.546
Since when have you been able to

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:28.548
do something like
this freaky crap?

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:32.218
[BROOK] What? You mean
make my soul leave my body?

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.687
Yeah, I thought only real
dead people did that.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.490
It's a new trick.
I was surprised.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:40.092
It first happened on my
world tour as Soul King.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.662
Quite suddenly.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:46.666
During that time, I had
fallen into a dreadful slump.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.470
The sales of my TDs and concert
tickets were on the decline.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.439
I wasn't sure what I should
do to stay relevant.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.243
Bummer. Today's show wasn't
groovy at all, was it?

00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:00.146
Hate to say it, but I liked
his old music better.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.082
It's like I don't
feel his soul anymore!

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:04.817
What the hell's
happening to you, Brook?

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.820
If you don't write a song that
sells, I'm cuttin' you loose!

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:13.826
I'm trying, I promise,
but it's not that easy.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.030
Music isn't something
you simply throw together.

00:08:18.064 --> 00:08:20.433
Maybe I'm forsaken

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.170
and the god of music doesn't
smile upon me anymore.

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.371
I beg of you!

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:28.207
Let me write one last good song!

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:32.044
Oh, please!
Bless me! God of music!

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.646
Grant me a melody
that will shake

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.715
all who hear it to their souls!

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.016
Please!

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:46.792
[BROOK gagging]

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.463
[BROOK]
Ka-Boom!

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:52.331
[screams]

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.667
What's going on?!

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.171
[chuckles] It was frightening at
first, but it really helped.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.040
With this new ability
came an epiphany.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.775
I finally realized
what was missing

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.644
from my music and how
to get out of my slump!

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.012
Which was?

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.480
[BROOK]
Uh...

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.784
Well...

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.453
...it's actually pretty obvious
when you think about it.

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:17.490
If a man can go
anywhere undetected,

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:21.127
there's one thing he's
going to go looking for!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.630
He's so lucky, Zoro!
Why can't I be dead like he is?

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.732
Really?

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:27.967
Hey!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.836
The water's gotten so high,
soon you will be dead like me!

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.538
[USOPP] You just had to
remind me, didn't you?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.408
Hurry up and do something!

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.822
[CAMIE] Please, you two!
Try to calm down!

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.724
Luffy! Jimbei!

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:52.959
This is no time for you guys

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.061
to act like you're
going to kill each other!

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.830
[LUFFY] Get outta my way.
I gotta go save my friends!

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.166
And when I'm done,
I'm kicking Hordy's ass!

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.535
[JIMBEI] I told you not to get
involved with him, Luffy!

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:05.371
Whoa, hey! Surely there's
a better way to work this out.

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.106
Yeah, stop it, both of you!

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:10.710
Luffy, please! I don't
want my friends to fight!

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:12.912
Shark! Let's go!

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.146
Get me back to the palace!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.247
Shaa!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.049
You'll have to go
through me first!

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:18.250
All right, fine by me!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:22.254
Fishman Karate!
The Shark Brick Fist!

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.128
[LUFFY grunting]

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:30.296
[LUFFY yells]

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:30.997
What?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.731
Oh, no!

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:32.798
[CHOPPER yells]

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:33.766
That looks bad!

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.202
[LUFFY groaning]

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:38.437
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.740
[LUFFY coughs]

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.577
[LUFFY]
Th-That hurt!

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.712
What, no way!
He's made of rubber.

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.981
Attacks like that
shouldn't even work on him!

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.916
But this is Fishman Karate--

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.220
a form based on
manipulating water.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.123
I can send shockwaves
through vapor in the air

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.692
until they finally
find my target's body.

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:02.461
Seeing as every living
creature is made up of water,

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:05.297
not even a rubber man
can escape the impact!

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.943
Bring it!

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.512
[JIMBEI grunts]

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.948
You shall not pass, Luffy!

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:25.951
Second Gear!

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:28.220
Now Gum-Gum...

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.823
...Jet Stamp!

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.360
[JIMBEI groans]

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.295
[LUFFY grunts, gasps]

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:42.702
After so much training, don't
tell me that's all you've got.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.103
Not a chance!

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:49.809
Enough of that.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:50.476
[JIMBEI, LUFFY gasp]

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:51.343
[NAMI, CHOPPER]
Robin!

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.645
[SHIRAHOSHI, CAMIE gasp]

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:53.612
You're back!

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.748
Hey! Get out of the way! Now!

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.983
Move it! You'll die!

00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.151
[SANJI]
Don't worry!

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:02.588
I'll save you!

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:04.623
[SANJI groaning]

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.458
[JIMBEI groans]

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:06.592
[LUFFY groans]

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.508
There's no need to fight.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.710
I'm sure you both
have your reasons,

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.212
but you're friends, right?

00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:30.216
Wait! You mean Robin's been
in the forest this entire time?!

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.288
Take this!

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.591
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groan]

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.160
[yelling]

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:43.129
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES groan]

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.767
Give it up already, all right?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.935
You guys don't stand
a chance against us!

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:53.038
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Heh, heh. Are you crazy?

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.941
What, did you not see Boss
Hordy's broadcast before?

00:12:55.975 --> 00:13:00.112
This country's gonna burn
and Neptune is gonna die!

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:00.913
[FISHMEN grunt]

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:01.981
Why, you!

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.216
--[FUKABOSHI] Stop!
--[ALL gasp]

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.152
Spare them their lives.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.054
If you do not, you will
be no better than they are!

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.257
[FISHMAN A]
But... But sir!

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.260
[FUKABOSHI] Ryuboshi, Manboshi,
take them into custody.

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.162
Count on me-re-do!

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.429
Same here!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.230
[DOSUN]
Heh.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:19.298
[FUKABOSHI grunts]

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:22.301
[DOSUN] I see you're
as weak-willed as ever.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:24.303
But I guess that
yellowbelly of yours

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.806
does run in the royal
family, doesn't it?

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.607
How dare you.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.177
It was reprehensible
to harm humans,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.779
now you assault your own kind?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:36.182
Does your heart
not weep in regret?

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:39.418
Of course it doesn't, because
any Fishman who willingly sides

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:42.388
with humans deserves
nothing less than execution!

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:45.891
So why don't we start
with you, Fukaboshi?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.061
[gasps]

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:51.964
[FUKABOSHI]
Have it your way, then!

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.133
[DOSUN groans]

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.259
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES grunting]

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.660
Dammit!

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.562
How'd we lose?

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:29.401
[FISHMEN laughing]

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:30.569
[FISHMAN B]
Yeah!

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.838
I never doubted the three
royal brothers for a second!

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.241
[FISHWOMAN A]
Thank you, Prince Fukaboshi!

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:37.676
M'lord, please
leave the rest to us.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.111
Much appreciated.

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.846
We must hurry to
Conchcorde Plaza

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.915
in order to prevent
our father's execution.

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:43.983
[MANBOSHI grunts]

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.084
[RYUBOSHI]
Mm.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:46.252
All right.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.786
Let's go!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:56.395
[HORDY] Well, it's about time
we got this show underway.

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:57.830
Do ya want some of us to stay

00:14:57.863 --> 00:15:01.400
and protect the palace while
you're gone, Boss Hordy?

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:04.470
No need. What?
Don't you remember?

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.906
No one else can get
through the palace gate.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:08.674
We'll station
a handful of men here

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:11.477
to make sure someone's around
to open it when I return.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.879
After all, you can't
lock out the new king!

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.014
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES laughing]

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:16.415
That'd be a shame!

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:17.783
[NEPTUNE]
More like nonsense!

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.952
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:21.620
[NEPTUNE] You will
never be respected as king

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:23.222
if you rule through violence.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.857
Huh.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.393
Is that really what you
want your last words to be?

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.728
I'd have gone for
something stronger.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.564
[HORDY groans]

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.300
My scar, it's burning.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.735
I can't believe that
stupid human swordsman

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.038
actually managed to cut me.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.172
It's wearing off.

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.474
Hey, it's time for my next dose.

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:43.709
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H]
Right.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.752
[HORDY chuckles]

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:56.088
Now I feel as good as new!

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.724
Isn't it dangerous
takin' that much at once?

00:15:58.757 --> 00:15:59.959
I thought so.

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:01.193
Hey, Captain?

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:04.163
Whadda we do with the three
Straw Hats we captured?

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:06.432
[HORDY]
Nothing. They're just humans.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.400
They'll drown if left alone.

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:09.668
And the palace is secure,

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:13.772
so no one will be able to rescue
them regardless of who comes.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.773
Forget 'em.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.809
Now, what's the current
status of the residents

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:19.311
from the Fishman District
that we recruited today?

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:21.680
They're doing just fine.

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:24.850
In fact, they should be
makin' their move as we speak.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.019
[HORDY]
Heh, heh.

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.554
That's good.

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:31.490
Pretty soon they'll
be out of the slums.

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.925
Seeing as once
all of the traitors

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.827
have left or been killed...

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.863
...there'll be plenty
of houses on the market.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.434
Then our country will finally be

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:45.838
united in its hatred for
the pathetic human race.

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.740
[HORDY chuckles]

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:53.145
I think I found it, guys!
A bright ray of hope!

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:56.982
Listen, those Fishmen we were
dealing with earlier have left,

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.018
so the palace is
completely empty!

00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:01.787
Or rather, it would be if they
hadn't left Pappagu behind!

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.122
That's awesome, Brook!

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.523
Now we just need to ask Pappagu

00:17:04.556 --> 00:17:06.892
to find the key to gets
us out of these chains!

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:09.428
I guess we need the one
to unlock this cage, too.

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.829
[ZORO]
Don't be an idiot.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:11.630
[USOPP]
Eh?

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.332
[ZORO]
Just find one of my swords.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:16.402
That's all we really
need to escape.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.203
I'll cut anything in my way.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.205
Yeah, that's all
you ever wanna do!

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.875
All right, I'm off to
search for Pappagu!

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.677
[BROOK laughs]

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:33.786
[PAPPAGU whimpering]

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:38.090
I am freaking out!
Why did this have to happen?

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:41.493
"Come have a banquet,"
they said, "it'll be fun!"

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.929
I hope the Straw Hats are okay.

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.998
[sighs]

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.366
[BROOK]
Pappagu.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.001
[PAPPAGU gasps]

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:53.572
[BROOK chuckling]

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.840
Ahh...

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:04.950
--[BROOK laughing]
--[PAPPAGU whimpering]

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.819
[BROOK]
Pappagu.

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:10.756
I found you!

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:15.427
[BROOK]
Boom!

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:18.897
At last! [laughs]

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:19.965
[PAPPAGU screams]

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:23.302
[PAPPAGU]
A ghost!

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:29.208
[PAPPAGU yelling]

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.809
[BROOK]
Wait, my friend!

00:18:30.843 --> 00:18:32.778
I hate this place!

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.714
Stop, Pappagu! I need your help!

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.950
Find the keys, please!

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:39.384
No, wait. The sword!

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.520
Yeah, yeah, go find the sword!

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:44.256
Go away! I don't know
what you're talking about!

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.993
[BROOK] You would if you'd
just listen to me! Wait!

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:56.034
[LUFFY panting]

00:18:56.068 --> 00:19:00.172
[JIMBEI panting]

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:06.912
Are you guys okay?
Need a doctor?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.948
Think, Luffy.

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:12.885
Have you considered
what will happen

00:19:12.918 --> 00:19:16.021
if you resort to violence
while on Fishman Island?

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:18.390
Every time my people
have tried to reach out

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.492
and open their hearts
to humans, they have been

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:23.695
met with nothing but
disappointment and prejudice.

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.597
"Humans like to make us suffer."

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:28.867
"Humans hate Fishmen!
They look down on us."

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.068
Don't you see?

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.371
This is what our citizens have
come to believe because of

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:35.440
the horrible things that
have happened in our past.

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:39.211
And Arlong is a perfect example.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.914
The people here believe that
the humans hunted him when

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:46.084
he went to the surface solely
because he was a Fishman.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:49.888
And now you, the people who
suppressed Arlong, are here.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:53.425
What will the islanders think
if you crush Hordy as well?

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:55.394
Misguided though he may be,

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:58.197
Hordy's aim is to fight
against persecution.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.266
So even if it saves us from
this crisis in the long run,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.303
if they see a group
of humans attacking him,

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.405
it will only solidify
the idea that things

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:08.607
will never change between us!

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.988
Oh, well. That's too bad.

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:24.223
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:27.359
[SANJI] You're crazy if you
think we won't rescue our crew.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.261
And unless we
do something soon,

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:32.798
Hordy's going to take
over the whole island.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:33.865
And that's a problem,

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.002
'cause we have a lot
of friends that live here...

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.503
...like Hachi.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:43.175
[SANJI] You've kept pretty quiet
about who banged you up so bad.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.244
But now that I think about it,

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.878
you mentioned before that Hordy

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:51.917
attacks any Fishman that
sympathizes with humans.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.052
So...

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.221
...I guess the reason
you're in that sorry state is

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.123
'cause you spoke up
for us, right?

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:01.560
[HACHI groans]

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.332
Why?

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:10.836
Hachin, is that true?
Hordy did this to you?

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:13.839
[groans] I can't say.

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:16.775
[SANJI]
Jimbei, with all that in mind,

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:19.011
I'm pretty sure Luffy
wants to fight so bad

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:21.713
because this is your home, too.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.483
When our captain's back
was against the wall,

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.752
you were the one who
was there to help him.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.430
[SANJI] For that, there's
no way we'll ever be able

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.732
to thank you enough.

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.801
But if Luffy wants to fight,

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:45.570
we'll fight with him,
whatever it takes.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:49.875
We won't be able to leave
the island like this.

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:53.979
We can't turn a blind eye.
There's too much at stake.

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:10.062
[SANJI]
We're taking a stand...

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.097
...because Camie's here!

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.265
[SANJI giggling]

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.100
[SANJI]
And Shirahoshi, too!

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.401
[SANJI giggles]

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:21.340
See? This island is the mermaid
paradise I've always dreamed of!

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:25.077
[sighs]

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:34.619
Get outta my way, Jimbei.

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:36.855
I won't let you
keep me here anymore.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:40.425
Let me handle it. You stay put.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.499
Shut up!

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:50.769
Sanji said all that cool stuff
and you still wanna fight?!

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:54.806
If that is what it takes
to make you listen to me, yes!

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.541
[LUFFY]
What did you say?!

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.710
[NAMI]
Ugh, knock it off!

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.027
[NARRATOR]
Neptune's execution draws nigh,

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:19.131
but Luffy and Jimbei have yet
to settle their differences.

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.833
As the New Fishman Pirates
spread across the island,

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:23.402
it seems that they
have won the battle

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:24.903
without a hit of resistance.

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.705
But Hordy himself
is experiencing

00:23:26.738 --> 00:23:29.241
a strange side effect
of the energy steroids

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:32.411
as his body undergoes
a horrifying transformation.

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.979
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.012 --> 00:23:35.814
"Something Has
Happened to Hordy!

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:38.150
The True Power
of the Evil Drug!"

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.519
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
