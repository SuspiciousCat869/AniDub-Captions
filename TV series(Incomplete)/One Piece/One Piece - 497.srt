1
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,490
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,227
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,828
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,831
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,366
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,136
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,804
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,840
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,610
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,245
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,846
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,783
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,586
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,923
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,126
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,898
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,035
[NARRATOR]
The battle of Marineford

18
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,904
ended with a Navy victory.

19
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,772
Unable to save Ace's life,

20
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,576
the injured Luffy was
taken to Amazon Lily,

21
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,111
where he fell into despair.

22
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,647
But this is a story
from another time.

23
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,717
Ten years ago, in the East
Blue, the brothers ran wild

24
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,718
with dreams of a world
full of adventure,

25
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,989
as well as the pirate flags
they would someday fly.

26
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,559
Tucked away in Mount Corvo,
living with the bandit, Dadan,

27
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,695
they spent their days with
their other "brother," Sabo.

28
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,501
[LUFFY] "Leaving the
Dadan Family For Good?!

29
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,103
The Kids' Hideout
Has Been Built!"

30
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,276
[DADAN grunting]

31
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,744
[DADAN]
So how has your day been?

32
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,878
[DOG 493A barks]

33
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,415
[DADAN screams]

34
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,582
[barks]

35
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,784
What moron dug a hole
right in front of our door?

36
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,953
When I get out,
I'm gonna strangle you!

37
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,588
The three kids did it.

38
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,423
They said it was to
catch some wild boars.

39
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,625
[DADAN]
This is my house!

40
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,761
Also, tell me sooner next
time, you bunch of dolts!

41
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,497
Those brats are in for it now!

42
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,666
[HOODLUM A] Sabo, you know
damn well this is our turf

43
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,100
and you've got no
right to be here.

44
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,469
Your turf?

45
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,604
You losers sure are delusional.

46
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,007
But let's skip the chit-chat and
get straight to the ass-kicking.

47
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,309
[HOODLUM A]
You cocky little twerp!

48
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,712
[HOODLUM B groans]

49
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,046
It's Ace!

50
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,716
Don't ignore me!

51
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,952
[LUFFY gasping]

52
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,987
[ALL grunting]

53
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,556
Dammit!

54
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,623
You're dead!

55
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,825
[LUFFY yells]

56
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,293
That is not normal!

57
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,428
[LUFFY grunting]

58
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,132
Oh, now you show up.

59
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,534
C'mon, Luffy!

60
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,674
Hey! Get up here, stupid! Hurry!

61
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,379
[LUFFY]
Finally!

62
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,213
[ACE]
Heh.

63
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:17,017
[HOODLUMS groaning]

64
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,387
[SABO] Let's try to
get a deer for dinner!

65
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,421
[LUFFY]
Sweet!

66
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,157
Well, don't just stand there!

67
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,525
Let's go hunting!

68
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,827
[ACE, SABO]
Luffy! Wait up!

69
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,361
[LUFFY]
Dadan, we're home!

70
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:31,198
Don't bother coming back
next time, you brats!

71
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,399
We brought back dinner.

72
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,034
You better start
cooking it now, though.

73
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,503
Uh-huh, 'cause I'm super hungry!

74
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,187
[LUFFY, SABO grunting]

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,889
[ACE growling]

76
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:03,897
[ALL yelling]

77
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,601
[DADAN yells] Quit throwing your
dinner around, you'll waste it!

78
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,735
[DADAN gasps]

79
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,706
[DADAN]
He's gonna eat me!

80
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,810
And don't come out until
you dumbasses are clean!

81
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,618
Hey, man! Quit that!

82
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:25,485
How do you like it?

83
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,320
[LUFFY gasps]

84
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:31,791
[ACE, SABO, LUFFY laughing]

85
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,964
[sighs] Honestly!

86
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,734
How come we gotta do a major
re-clean on this place

87
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,269
after every single dinner?

88
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,070
I can catch my own damn food--

89
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,206
those little monkeys
have got to go.

90
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,511
[DADAN sighs]
Now that ain't half bad!

91
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,646
[LUFFY giggling]

92
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,848
Luffy! C'mere!

93
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,151
[LUFFY laughing]

94
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,485
[ACE growls]

95
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,221
Uh, sorry, boss?

96
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,291
[DOGRA gasps]

97
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,493
[DADAN]
Peace at last.

98
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:13,400
The end of the day is
the only time I can relax.

99
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,174
[ACE] Let's train a
little more before bed!

100
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,876
I won't lose this time!

101
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,177
You're dreaming already!

102
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,144
And go!

103
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,079
[BOTH yell]

104
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,524
[DADAN chuckling]

105
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,193
[SABO groans]

106
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,894
[ACE groans]

107
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,863
[HOT DADAN laughing]

108
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,064
Oh!

109
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,301
Oh, hello fairy!

110
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,336
[DADAN chuckles]

111
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,046
[HOT DADAN groans]

112
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,316
[DADAN groans]

113
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,317
[LUFFY groans]

114
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,352
Ow!

115
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,320
Hey, Luffy, are you still alive?

116
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,989
Your floor sure is crappy.

117
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,825
You're a couple of cheaters!

118
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,393
[DADAN growls, yells]

119
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:14,561
[LUFFY]
Huh? Huh?!

120
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,563
[LUFFY screams]

121
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,031
Bedtime?

122
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,431
I think so.

123
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:22,469
That was officially
the last straw.

124
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,371
If we don't throw
those brats out now,

125
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,707
they'll bring down
our whole operation.

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,442
Not to mention they're
starting to become

127
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,710
hazardous to my health!

128
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,712
[MAGRA] There, there,
boss, take it easy.

129
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,081
[DOGRA] I think they've
actually been running the show

130
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,715
for a while now.

131
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,185
[DADAN] Then I'll remind them
this is the Dadan Family,

132
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,753
not the brat family!

133
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,289
In other words,
they're out of here!

134
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,591
Garp can suck it!
He doesn't own me!

135
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,126
[MAYOR]
Hey!

136
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,627
[DADAN]
Garp?

137
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,400
[DADAN] Forgive me! I didn't
mean anything I just said!

138
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,434
I lost my mind!

139
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,603
[MAKINO]
Sorry to trouble you,

140
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,471
but we're looking for
a boy named Luffy.

141
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,206
We were told he lives here now.

142
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,473
[DADAN]
Huh?

143
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,246
[DADAN]
Huh?

144
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,080
Makino!

145
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,148
Luffy!

146
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:08,248
[LUFFY, MAKINO giggle]

147
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,884
You're so big and strong now!

148
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,018
It's been six months,

149
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,220
so we decided to stop by
and see how you're doing.

150
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,755
[LUFFY]
Hey, mister mayor!

151
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,124
Just don't tell Garp, okay?

152
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,293
So he's really got
you shacked up here

153
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,427
with the mountain bandits, huh?

154
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,728
You got a problem with that?

155
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,063
Of course I do!

156
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,332
Especially the "mountain
bandit" part, you ruffian!

157
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,566
Wait, "ruffian"?

158
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,503
Is everybody from Windmill
Village as annoying as you?

159
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,639
I brought presents for you!

160
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,574
Knowing Garp, he probably
didn't leave you

161
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,676
with a darned thing, did he?

162
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,610
Ta-dah!

163
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,078
Bet you could use
some new clothes!

164
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,180
[LUFFY]
That shirt's awesome!

165
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,083
I brought some for
your friends, too.

166
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,018
Might have to adjust
the length, though.

167
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,585
Can you boys come
here for a second?

168
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,687
[ACE, SABO]
Uh--

169
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,355
Please?

170
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,657
--Uh--Huh? Sabo!
--[SABO giggles]

171
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,959
And you, too!

172
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,294
Tch.

173
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,299
[MAKINO] I heard this Ace
kid was pretty naughty,

174
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,635
but you seem like a good boy.

175
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,637
Who the hell told you that?

176
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,005
[LUFFY, SABO giggling]

177
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,173
That little dork.

178
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,875
[LUFFY]
Ace, you're blushing!

179
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,775
Hey, shut up!

180
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,711
[MAKINO]
Come on, now, hold still!

181
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,346
You're both gonna get it later.

182
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,316
[BOTH laughing]

183
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,188
I hope everything tastes good!

184
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,958
[ALL cheering]

185
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,593
[LUFFY gasps]

186
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,998
[SABO] Ah, man, I wanna
eat good food like this

187
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,400
when I'm out at sea, too.

188
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,035
Soon as I get my
pirate crew together,

189
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,537
the first thing I'll do is find
the best cook in the world!

190
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,306
Too bad I'm gonna
become a pirate

191
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,008
and recruit the best
cook before you do.

192
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,175
Yeah, you wish!

193
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,345
I'm gonna be a pirate
before either of you dopes!

194
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,714
[LUFFY, ACE]
Hm?

195
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,783
[GARP clears throat]

196
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:55,055
You little bastards are still
spouting that pirate crap?

197
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,757
You're both gonna be
Marines someday,

198
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,360
even if I gotta beat
some dignity into you!

199
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,227
[ACE groans]

200
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,294
[LUFFY groans]

201
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,531
--Dadan!
--Yes, Garp, sir?

202
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,734
Why did you have to hit me, too?

203
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,771
'Cause you're doing a crappy job
of teaching my boys, clearly!

204
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,172
Wait, that guy is Garp?

205
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:14,909
Didn't know Ace and Luffy's
grandpa was so cranky.

206
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,143
Hey, squirt.

207
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,712
I heard you spouting some of
that pirate nonsense, too.

208
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,915
He's not a squirt! He's Sabo!

209
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,083
We already made a promise
over a cup of saké,

210
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,585
so we're gonna be
pirates someday,

211
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,952
whether you like it or not!

212
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,021
[ACE]
Doesn't he ever shut up?

213
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,924
[GARP]
Really! Well, I'm a Marine,

214
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,226
so if you boys want to act
like a bunch of criminals,

215
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,128
then I'll tan your hides
like a bunch of criminals!

216
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:40,101
--[ACE, SABO, LUFFY screaming]
--[GARP] Better start running!

217
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,968
Hang in there, Luffy.

218
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,572
I think he'll do just fine,

219
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,008
now that he has two
brothers to run around with!

220
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,044
[ALL screaming]

221
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,711
Oh, no you don't!

222
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,813
Take this!

223
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:54,081
And that!

224
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,816
How 'bout one of these?

225
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,419
[SABO] I think "grandpa"
might be a monster.

226
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:03,156
[ACE, SABO, LUFFY screaming]

227
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,825
[GARP]
That's enough for today!

228
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,462
Get some sleep so you'll be
ready for tomorrow's lesson!

229
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,597
'Cause it's gonna
be even tougher.

230
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:23,944
[snoring]

231
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:25,479
If we don't get the
heck out of here,

232
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,314
the old man is probably
gonna kill us.

233
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,982
And even if we do
survive tomorrow,

234
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,818
he's not gonna stop
pounding us like that

235
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,586
till we've all
given up on our dream!

236
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,421
But I don't wanna die!

237
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:36,357
[ACE]
We only have one choice.

238
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,091
It's time for us to grow up.

239
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,559
Are you with me?

240
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,096
[snoring]

241
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,934
[GARP snoring]

242
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,636
[yawns]

243
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,375
[DADAN]
"We will stand on our feet."

244
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,016
[screams]

245
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,151
[yawns]

246
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,685
They left us this note.

247
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,753
What now?

248
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,390
Heh. Those numbskulls
think they're clever.

249
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:10,657
That's your reaction?

250
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,826
They may only be children,
but they've made enemies

251
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,628
with every stinkin'
crook in the city!

252
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,530
I mean, I don't like
looking after them,

253
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,465
but if we don't, there's no
telling what could happen

254
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,300
if someone catches
them off-guard!

255
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,136
[GARP]
Anyway, back to work!

256
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,505
Be sure to turn them into
full-fledged Marines

257
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,240
by the time I get back!

258
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,008
There's not a chance in hell!

259
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:28,976
[GARP]
What'd you say?

260
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,711
Nothing! Bye!

261
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,950
[DADAN laughing]

262
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,989
How're bandits s'posed to
raise a Marine? Moron!

263
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,724
If it's so damn easy,
why don't you try?

264
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:45,559
Now, now, calm down.

265
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:48,028
You were just saying you wanted
those brats out of the house--

266
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,364
don't tell me you're actually
worrying about them now?

267
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,532
[MAGRA groans]

268
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,734
[DADAN]
What do I care? Ha!

269
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,502
I'll finally be able
to sleep at night--

270
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:57,672
and come to think of it,
they even left on their own,

271
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,006
so it's all their fault!

272
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,141
Let them get murdered out there!

273
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,244
All right, we got away!

274
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,314
And no one followed us.
That's kinda weird.

275
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,519
[DADAN] The devil's children
have the devil's luck!

276
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:13,587
How 'bout that?

277
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,423
'Cause Ace is the
devil's son, for sure.

278
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,227
Ah, whatever. Dadan's
wanted me gone for ages.

279
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,763
I bet she's pretty
happy right now.

280
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:23,830
Huh?

281
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,636
[DOGRA] Good grief!
It's comin' down hard today!

282
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,384
[ACE] Let's stay here
till the rain stops.

283
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,687
[LUFFY giggles] No dumb
grown-ups to tell us what to do!

284
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,060
[DADAN groans]
That's it, I changed my mind.

285
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,395
I get enough crap
from Garp as-is.

286
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:56,463
What are you waiting for,

287
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,631
get out there and
find those brats!

288
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,799
[MAGRA, DOGRA]
Yes, ma'am, right away!

289
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,090
[DOGRA]
Hey, guys!

290
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,593
[MAGRA]
Ace! Sabo!

291
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,228
Luffy!

292
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,363
[SABO]
Look at this!

293
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,631
Cool. What is it?

294
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,199
I designed a hideout for us!

295
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,433
Until we've got our pirate ship,

296
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,735
it sure beats sleeping
outdoors every night!

297
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,371
And this tree should be perfect!

298
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,472
We can build it right here!

299
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,408
Our own hideout?

300
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,776
That's so awesome!

301
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,777
What do you think we
should build it with?

302
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,547
We live right next to a
mountain of trash, remember?

303
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,015
Now let's go.

304
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,593
Nice! It's our own
secret hideout!

305
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,530
Looks good, if I
say so myself! Uh--

306
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,098
Yo, Ace, what's wrong?

307
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,067
If this is a real hideout,

308
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,002
then it could use
some booby traps!

309
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:24,404
Great idea,
I'll get to work on it!

310
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:27,941
[sighs]

311
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,143
[LUFFY]
Whoo!

312
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,445
We got a view of Gray Terminal,
the Windmill Village,

313
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,747
and even the East Blue!

314
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,716
Yeah, but we've seen
all those places before.

315
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,717
What's the big deal?

316
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,553
It's different seeing
them from up here!

317
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:45,725
Whoa.

318
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,901
This is nice.

319
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,402
You're right!

320
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,249
Got a tailwind coming--
Set the sails!

321
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,784
Aye, aye!

322
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,591
[SABO] Ha, ha! That's the
spot on the treasure map!

323
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,093
Got an enemy off the
bow and starboard!

324
00:19:20,127 --> 00:19:21,595
It's Bluejam's ship!

325
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,463
Prepare for battle!

326
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:27,001
[gasps] Damn it, they're
firing at us already--

327
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,502
Take evasive action now!

328
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:29,336
Hey, Luffy!

329
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,438
Hard aport, and make it snappy!

330
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,741
Roger. Hard aport!

331
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,976
No, no, no, you forgot
to say "steady"

332
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,812
when you're steering the ship!

333
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,446
No prob.

334
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,115
Again, hard aport, and quickly!

335
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,986
Okay, hard aport, steady and go!

336
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:52,325
Ha! It's gonna be
close-quarters! Get ready, men!

337
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,197
We'll jump 'em after
they come aboard.

338
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,364
You got it!

339
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,600
Let's try not to cry
this time, okay?

340
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,467
Okay!

341
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,369
[PIRATES yell]

342
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,004
[SABO grunts]

343
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,539
[LUFFY yells]

344
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,210
[ACE grunting]

345
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:10,377
[gasps]

346
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,512
[ACE yells]

347
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,815
Bluejam is defeated!

348
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,183
All right!

349
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,018
That'll teach 'em!

350
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,190
Now this is how you live!

351
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,092
Uh-huh, no kidding.

352
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,863
[LUFFY giggles]
What an awesome hideout!

353
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,432
So, that's where they are.

354
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,635
[DADAN] What do you mean
you haven't found them yet?

355
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:35,836
[BANDITS]
Sorry!

356
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,305
We've talked to people who
saw them at Gray Terminal

357
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,240
and in the jungle but
it's still no use,

358
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,608
nobody's seen them lately!

359
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:44,111
That's impossible,
it's been two weeks!

360
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,646
What if that tiger
ate them for dinner

361
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,382
and there's nothing
left but bones?

362
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,817
[DOGRA]
We found them, boss!

363
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,152
[MAGRA]
Yeah, we found 'em!

364
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,586
Are they still alive?

365
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,955
Yeah--they built their own
hideout deep in the jungle

366
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:56,223
in that gigantic tree!

367
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:59,126
It's true! We could even
take you to see if you like!

368
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,127
Thank goodness.

369
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,962
We're really happy
for you, boss!

370
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:04,164
And to think, you were
worrying so much!

371
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:05,766
[DADAN gasps]

372
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,235
So, they're still alive?
Well, fancy that.

373
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:12,472
I stopped caring, since I was
sure they'd been eaten by now.

374
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,575
What? What the hell is it?

375
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,076
Quit standing around gawking!

376
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,311
Go kill something for dinner

377
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,313
before I decide
to kill you first!

378
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:20,714
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am!

379
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,829
[snoring]

380
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:39,866
Yo, Ace, Sabo, wait up...

381
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,502
They're monsters
when they're awake,

382
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:44,104
but they're adorable
when they're sleeping.

383
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,473
Oh, no, dear.

384
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,542
You're going to catch a cold.

385
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,479
[DADAN groans]

386
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,823
[thud]

387
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,826
Oh! Hey, a trap just went off!

388
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,194
We've got intruders already?

389
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:43,497
Nothing?

390
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,798
Guess it was a fluke.

391
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,701
I kinda made it in a hurry,
so maybe I goofed up somewhere.

392
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,769
I'll just check it tomorrow.

393
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:52,505
What is it?

394
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,175
[DADAN]
Ouch.

395
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,342
Little rats!

396
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,545
Go ahead and be pirates,
I don't give a damn!

397
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:00,780
In fact, I hope all three
of you drown at sea!

398
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,094
[NARRATOR]
When Luffy and his friends

399
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,530
have a dangerous encounter
with a wild bear,

400
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,133
the strange old man
comes to their rescue.

401
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,534
Despite his appearance,

402
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:23,004
he claims to have once
challenged Gold Roger.

403
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,538
Eyes wide with wonder,

404
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:28,108
Luffy is eager to hear an untold
tale of the King of the Pirates.

405
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:29,943
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

406
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,879
"Luffy Becoming an Apprentice?!

407
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,781
A Man Who Fought Against
the King of the Pirates!"

408
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,450
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
