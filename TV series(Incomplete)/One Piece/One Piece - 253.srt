1
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,718
She was willing to
sacrifice the lives

2
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:21,355
of everyone in this
world, even her own.

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,758
As long as she could
save the six of you.

4
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,505
Robin, wait!

5
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,042
We're coming for you, Robin!

6
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,444
Please, don't go!

7
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,513
I don't care who you're up
against. We'll help you!

8
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,754
Wait!

9
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,356
Robin!

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,686
Looks like we were too late.

11
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:39,653
Ow!

12
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,587
Seriously!

13
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,457
What was that guy
trying to pull, anyway?

14
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,293
Whatever the case,
it really doesn't matter.

15
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,394
That was a Government train.

16
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,031
He'll be captured, and
that will be the end of it.

17
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,702
Hey, isn't he with Galley-La?

18
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,236
Hey, Paulie!

19
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,740
Try to act
professional, will ya?

20
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,145
It looks like there's something
going on between them.

21
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,513
This is a train station!

22
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,682
People say hello and
goodbye here every day!

23
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,417
It's our responsibility
as employees here

24
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,454
to silently oversee
things like this.

25
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,056
Yeah, you're right!

26
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,692
Keep quiet!

27
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,393
Got it?

28
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,229
Quiet. Got it.

29
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,432
Train left a little early, huh?

30
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,469
Uh, yes! That's right!

31
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,537
All of the passengers
were already on board,

32
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,638
so they decided to--

33
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,642
The weather's getting
rougher by the minute, too.

34
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,645
At this rate, Aqua Laguna
could hit at any moment!

35
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,281
With all of these factors
in mind, it was decided

36
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:43,316
that the departure time
should be pushed forward!

37
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,121
It's not safe here right now.

38
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,089
You should take shelter
on the Shipbuilding Island

39
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,491
as soon as possible.

40
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,726
That goes for the
young lady, as well.

41
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,594
Yeah, you're right.

42
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,532
Hey listen, the train's gone.

43
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,301
There's nothing we
can do to stop it.

44
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,303
I hate to say it,

45
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:07,507
but Enies Lobby isn't the
kind of place where--

46
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,412
Are you crying?

47
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,648
Hey, look I-I understand
how you must feel, but--

48
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,084
After them!

49
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,186
She's pissed!

50
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:22,423
I'll never forgive those
World Government idiots!

51
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,091
Listen, I need a ship!

52
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,726
What in the hell are
you talking about?

53
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,561
The strongest and
fastest you've got!

54
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,264
You wanna set sail in
the middle of all this?

55
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,799
Don't be an idiot!

56
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,635
Do you have any idea how
dangerous this storm is?

57
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,069
Lay off!

58
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,203
I can handle it!

59
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,339
Look, this isn't some
regular run-of-the-mill storm

60
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,807
we're talking about!

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,309
It's about to be hell
at sea around here!

62
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,178
It's impossible to sail out now!

63
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,413
Doing so is nothing
short of a death wish!

64
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,681
Listen to me!

65
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:51,017
Robin is throwing her life away
for our sake and I'm not gonna--

66
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,693
That was close.

67
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,694
Thank you!

68
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,762
Yes, thank you!

69
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,463
You saved us all!

70
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,731
If it wasn't for you,

71
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,834
we would've all been
swept out into the sea!

72
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,102
Look at that.

73
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,639
That huge fixture with the train
schedule on it was torn apart.

74
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,776
Nothing like that has ever
happened here before.

75
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,077
Not even with Aqua Laguna.

76
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,453
This thing's power
is unbelievable.

77
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,623
And the actual storm
isn't even here yet!

78
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,359
Aqua Laguna is
different this year.

79
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,094
These waves are coming in fast!

80
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:13,734
Hey, is that sea train that they
took Robin on in any danger?

81
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,036
It should be able to make
it out of this rough patch

82
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,706
before the actual
storm makes landfall.

83
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,441
Unless it takes a direct hit,

84
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:24,645
that train's capable of cutting
through these big waves.

85
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,313
Um, excuse me.

86
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,381
Are you Nami?

87
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,148
Huh?

88
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,249
Yes?

89
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,685
Someone left you a note
out in front of the station.

90
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,221
Must've been one
of your crewmates.

91
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:34,788
A note?

92
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,922
From who?

93
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,526
And how did you manage to
notice something so small?

94
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,661
It was right here.

95
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,230
Whoever it was
made it easy for us.

96
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,336
That dimwit!

97
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,474
So, what does it say?

98
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:54,808
Give me a second.

99
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,678
The first half is just
a hopeless love letter.

100
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,747
Did she say "love letter"?

101
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,782
It seems there's a love
triangle going on here.

102
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,416
No.

103
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,451
Considering the situation,

104
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,053
I'd say the other
man is most likely--

105
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,426
What are you staring at?

106
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,128
The important part starts here.

107
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:20,134
P.S. I saw Robin get on
the 11 o'clock train.

108
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:24,238
I'm gonna hop on
board and follow her.

109
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:27,107
Sanji got on board that train?

110
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,243
Usopp's there, too?

111
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:33,280
"And some arrogant thug with
a ducktail." Who's that?

112
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,782
That must be Franky.

113
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,450
Yeah, must be.

114
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,252
She mentioned another man!

115
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:41,789
And it sounds like Franky, of
all people, must be the fifth!

116
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,058
Poor Paulie doesn't
stand a chance.

117
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,361
Maybe it'd be better if
he just threw in the towel.

118
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,196
What in the hell
is with you guys?!

119
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,764
Oh, and there's something else.

120
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,633
This was left on the
ground alongside that letter.

121
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,106
There should be at least
one transponder snail

122
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,641
somewhere on that sea train.

123
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,276
I'll contact you
as soon as I can.

124
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:09,283
Keep this portable one close
to you at all times, my darling.

125
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,384
Just pretend it's me

126
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,254
and hold it lovingly against
your soft, beautiful--

127
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,188
I get it.

128
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,657
He left this one to
communicate with us.

129
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,658
Wow.

130
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,527
He must have anticipated
Nico Robin's movements.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,729
Pretty impressive!

132
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,463
I'll say!

133
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,636
At least for the time being,
Robin has Sanji with her.

134
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,304
The rest of us will
just have to catch up

135
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,572
with them at Enies Lobby.

136
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:47,487
Man, can't even manage to light
up a single smoke out here.

137
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,690
Really?

138
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,526
So after that, Sanji
went to the train station?

139
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,627
Yep!

140
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,464
And Usopp's on
the train with him!

141
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,199
Thank goodness!

142
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:01,635
At any rate, no matter how
we're going to follow them,

143
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,672
we can't do anything until
we find Luffy and Zoro first!

144
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:05,606
Understand?

145
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,040
Right!

146
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,241
I got it Nami.

147
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,343
I'm a hundred percent certain
about which way they flew

148
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,079
so head in that direction
and start looking!

149
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,581
You guys help look, too!

150
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,182
Let's do this!

151
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,283
Are you with me?

152
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,185
Yeah!

153
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,453
We won't let you down!

154
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,700
Now, what would be the best way

155
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,402
for one to sneak
inside this thing?

156
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,504
Whoa!

157
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,539
This storm is insane!

158
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,615
Collier Shoot!

159
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,053
Who in the hell are you?

160
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,287
Hey, hold it!

161
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,523
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:30,758
Don't move!

163
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,494
Whoa, did you see that kick?

164
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,729
He's not some
run-of-the-mill civilian!

165
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,734
Come on, now.

166
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,770
If you keep saying
things like that...

167
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,475
...I'll blush.

168
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,177
It wasn't a compliment!

169
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,414
He's making fun of us!

170
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:53,981
Hey!

171
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,015
Go let Rob Lucci know

172
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,618
that we've got a suspicious
intruder on board!

173
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,185
Wait a minute!

174
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,258
This insignificant little
matter isn't something

175
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,061
we need to bother CP9 with.

176
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,364
No matter how violent
or unruly this man is,

177
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,066
it won't do him any good.

178
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:15,268
Because, in this car, you've
got... Whoa, it's smoky!

179
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,773
In this car, you've got me!

180
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,274
Jerry!

181
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,781
That's right.

182
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,117
You're looking at the champion
on a South Blue island

183
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,386
renowned for its martial arts.

184
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,190
The undefeated Boxing Champion!

185
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,525
I prefer karate.

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,297
If you can handle my punches
then maybe I'll show you some!

187
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,200
Easy!

188
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,601
No need to overdo it!

189
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:52,205
Jerry Aurura Flicker!

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,041
Hey, Jerry!

191
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,309
Your target's behind you!

192
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,146
You're a sneaky one!

193
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,147
Now, listen!

194
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,116
Don't think you have me
at a disadvantage just

195
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,553
because I'm so very tall and
this train car is so very tiny!

196
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,155
This is the first time
I've ever talked to someone

197
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:10,324
whose head is where
their crotch should be.

198
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,825
My boxing technique
is more effective

199
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,761
in tight places like this!

200
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,829
Prepare for annihilation!

201
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,265
Go, Yoga Style!

202
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,266
One-two!

203
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,201
You just shortened your reach!

204
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,369
That's what you think!

205
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,804
All part of the plan.

206
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,240
Screw!

207
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,676
Drop Kick!

208
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,179
That's totally against
every single rule of boxing!

209
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,282
This is a waste of time.

210
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,419
Brochette!

211
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,634
I'll start with the
seventh and last car.

212
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,336
All of the World Government
officials are there.

213
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:03,244
In order of increasing strength,
the fifth car is next.

214
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,813
That car holds 40 marines
and the man who leads them,

215
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,416
a Navy Headquarters Captain
and former knight named T-Bone.

216
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,685
Next, in the 4th car,
we have Wanze,

217
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,722
an accomplished martial artist
from Cipher Pol number 7

218
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,691
who also happens to be
the head steward on this trip.

219
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:21,428
Standing by in the 3rd car is
Nero, the newest member of CP9,

220
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,463
and a force to be reckoned with.

221
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,712
Anyway, though we
are escorting criminals,

222
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,382
with government personnel
as trained and powerful

223
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,449
as the ones I mentioned,

224
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,252
we needn't worry about
the possibility of a raid.

225
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,353
Our military might

226
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,321
is represented
throughout this train.

227
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,761
Straw Hat!

228
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,663
Zoro!

229
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,231
We're here to help!

230
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,666
Come out!

231
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,201
Where are you?!

232
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,339
Mister Foreman, it must be
hard for you to even move.

233
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,540
Maybe you should
take a little break.

234
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,474
Don't be stupid!

235
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,375
This is nothing!

236
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,543
Hurry up and find them!

237
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,577
Yes, sir!

238
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,348
Has anyone gone to
bring Iceberg up to speed?

239
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,783
Two men went to
give him a report!

240
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,326
Hey, where are you
going, Mr. Iceberg?

241
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,361
Sir?

242
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,532
Hey, Zoro!

243
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,766
Where are you?

244
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,635
Answer us, Straw Hat!

245
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,071
Luffy!

246
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,172
Zoro! Luffy!

247
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,540
Come on guys, answer me!

248
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,441
Where the heck are you?

249
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,045
What's that?

250
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:45,746
Food, you say?

251
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,614
Yes, that's right.

252
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,248
We need meat.

253
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,515
All the meat you can find!

254
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,149
And hurry!

255
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,353
We're running out of time!

256
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:55,289
How did we end up being a couple
of errand boys for that girl?!

257
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,423
We're not doing this for her!

258
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,092
We're doing it for Paulie!

259
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,526
He's so devoted to
that crazy woman,

260
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,628
even after she dumped him!

261
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,229
We've gotta give this our all!

262
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,163
Yeah, you're right!

263
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,431
Keep going!

264
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,301
In any case, she
must be really hungry!

265
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,503
She's still a growing girl!

266
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,304
Right?

267
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,438
I guess!

268
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,645
It's no use.

269
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,282
None of the stores are open.
Everyone's evacuated.

270
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,349
Hey, wait a minute!

271
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:25,152
What about the kitchen
back at the train station?

272
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,453
No way!

273
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,487
Think about it!

274
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,590
The backstreets are
probably already flooded!

275
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,493
Then we've got no choice but
to keep looking around here!

276
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:32,993
But--

277
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:34,228
Let's get moving!

278
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:37,297
What do you think will happen
if we show up empty handed?!

279
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,814
Rain.

280
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,748
This is bad.

281
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:57,284
The strong winds are
already interfering

282
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,152
with my sense of smell.

283
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:12,499
Man, I'm beat.

284
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,568
It feels like we've been
calling for hours,

285
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,237
but there's still no answer.

286
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,404
You think that maybe they're--

287
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:18,339
Don't be ridiculous!

288
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,374
Just keep trying!

289
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,111
Luffy, Zoro!

290
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,480
Where in the world are you?

291
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,115
There's no way that
leopard guy took you out.

292
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,353
We finally know
why Robin left us

293
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,688
and we need to do
something about it!

294
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,191
Straw Hat, where are you?!

295
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,259
Answer us!

296
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,193
Please!

297
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,531
Hang in there, Robin.

298
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,432
Luffy and the rest of us

299
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,068
are coming to save
you no matter what!

300
00:17:58,712 --> 00:17:59,813
What's going on here?

301
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,248
Oh! Paulie!

302
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,749
Quick, come see for yourself!

303
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,156
The more the tide recedes,

304
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,759
the bigger the
returning waves will be.

305
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,328
If you pay attention
to the ebb of the tide,

306
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:18,332
you can measure the
magnitude of the storm surge.

307
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm flying!

308
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:20,634
Meow!

309
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,703
And, if you
consider how much lower

310
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:26,406
the water level's
going to be this year.

311
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,641
Hey, Chimney!

312
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,476
Take a look!

313
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:31,645
Whoa!

314
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,213
Amazing!

315
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,482
Meow! Meow! Meow!

316
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,627
It's almost as if
the sea has dried up.

317
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,464
I haven't seen anything
like this in my entire life.

318
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,533
The power of the
sea is astonishing.

319
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,505
No way.

320
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,774
How can the tide be so low?

321
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:04,044
I've never seen
anything like it!

322
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:08,549
Just how big of a wave
is coming this time?

323
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:12,620
All of the backstreets are going
to be completely swallowed up!

324
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,388
I hope nobody's
still down there.

325
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:17,424
If there is,
they'll die instantly!

326
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,669
The roar of the ocean.

327
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,205
It's gone.

328
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,173
Look-ee, look-ee,
look-ee, look-ee, look-ee!

329
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,742
Meow, meow, meow!

330
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,676
Hey, Granny!

331
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:36,744
Take a look over there!

332
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,145
I see something!

333
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,514
You do, do you?

334
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,548
Yeah!

335
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,483
There's something
between those two buildings!

336
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:45,719
Come on, Granny!

337
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,220
Look! Look!

338
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,758
Kokoro!

339
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,425
Oh!

340
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,794
If it isn't the pirate girl!

341
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:54,561
Hey!

342
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,063
Miss Pirate Lady!

343
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:56,597
Look!

344
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,765
Look over there!

345
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,200
I see something!

346
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,068
Like what?

347
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,773
Just what are you going
on about, Chimney?

348
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,174
No way!

349
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,709
What happened to the sea?

350
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,310
It's dried up!

351
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,644
Luffy!

352
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,685
That straw hat.

353
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:55,723
Isn't that your "King
of the Pirates" captain?

354
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,124
Well?

355
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:01,194
That idiot!

356
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,465
Hey, hold on!

357
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:06,100
Where do you think you're going?

358
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,434
Don't go down
to the back streets!

359
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,702
It's dangerous!

360
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,137
"To the backstreets"?

361
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,405
Hey! Wait!

362
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,206
Somebody stop that woman!

363
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,219
Are you trying
to kill yourself?!

364
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:29,289
Aqua Laguna is gonna hit
at any moment! Come back!

365
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,096
Luffy! Luffy! Luffy!

366
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:16,664
Oh!

367
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:17,932
Hey, Nami!

368
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:20,834
I kind of got stuck here when
that leopard guy sent me flying.

369
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:21,401
Listen!

370
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,203
Robin was lying to us!

371
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:23,771
She was?

372
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:24,838
About what?

373
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,374
She's sacrificing herself
in order to protect us!

374
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,442
Then let's get going!

375
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,743
We gotta protect her!

376
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,312
On the next One Piece:

377
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,213
"Nami's Soul Cries Out!

378
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,348
Straw Hat Luffy
Makes A Comeback!"

379
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
