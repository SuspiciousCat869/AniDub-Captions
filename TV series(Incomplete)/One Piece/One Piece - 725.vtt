00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:37.481
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:40.387
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.531
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.342
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:53.246
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.752
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.524
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.866
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.368
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:08.677
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.286
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.229
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.333
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.408
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.481
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.187
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.226
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.830
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:37.301
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:40.642
until at last,
only their leader remained.

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:43.012
Now, the fate of Dressrosa
will be decided

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:46.586
in a one-on-one duel between
Luffy and Doflamingo.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.859
Don't forget.
I'm a captain, too.

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:54.803
If I leave you and Doflamingo
for Straw Hat to defeat alone,

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:57.274
I'd be abandoning my pride.

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:59.580
You're stuck on the ground
like a miserable worm!

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:01.149
What pride do you have left?

00:04:01.182 --> 00:04:05.524
I'm so sick of you! Just die!

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:08.964
[LAW]
Takt!

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:11.402
[TREBOL]
What the?

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:13.841
No!

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:16.246
Sterben Blade!

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.784
Pigya!

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:24.729
Pigya!

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:32.078
What the hell kind of
plan was that? [groans]

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.016
Shooting your arm at me?

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.788
You little cheater.

00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:47.407
You wanna play like that?

00:04:57.128 --> 00:05:02.371
Law. You can die with me!

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:04.174
[LAW gasps]

00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:06.514
You've lost it!
Put away the fire!

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:10.019
See you in hell, Law!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.035
Look close.

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.844
The man with Luffy is
a Warlord, like Doflamingo.

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:23.681
That's Trafalgar Law.

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:24.650
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:26.118
[ROBIN]
And he's in pretty bad shape!

00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:27.154
[LEO]
Lawland!

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:28.390
[LUFFY gasps]

00:05:28.423 --> 00:05:31.062
[ROBIN]
Down here! Let me take Traffy!

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:32.698
[LUFFY]
Robin! Good idea!

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:37.374
He's hurt, but Traffy
held his own against Mingo!

00:05:37.407 --> 00:05:39.445
[ROBIN]
Oh no! His arm!

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:41.416
I've got you!

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.787
Cien Fleurs: Spider Net!

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:53.206
What happened to Lawland's arm?

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.542
We'll get through this.

00:05:54.576 --> 00:05:56.780
So don't you worry.
I've got you.

00:05:56.813 --> 00:05:58.249
Nico Robin!

00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.385
[ROBIN gasps]

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:01.756
I don't want you
butting in on our fight!

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.295
The man's still
breathing, isn't he?

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:07.134
Then I'm not done with him!

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.469
Doflamingo!

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:10.841
[LUFFY] Leave Traffy alone!
This is our fight now!

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:11.977
This'll finish you!

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.846
[gasps]

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:14.916
All right, Gum-Gum...

00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:18.222
Bullet String!

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:20.360
...Hawk Whip!

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.665
[gasps] Damn it!

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:26.874
You have to flee!

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:29.111
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:32.183
Robin! Run away!

00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:10.894
[CAVENDISH]
Precious Metal Axe!

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:15.939
It's Cabbage!

00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:19.513
Forgive me.
Up till now I was sleeping.

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:22.084
You still haven't
cleaned up this mess?

00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:23.854
C'mon, Straw Hat!

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:41.355
Hey, Cabbage!

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:44.963
Take everyone and
get off the plateau!

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.533
Are you kidding me?

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:47.736
Why would I do that

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:49.539
when Doflamingo's
standing right there?

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:52.611
Let me fight him! Just one blow!

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.419
I'm leaving my friends
in your hands!

00:07:56.452 --> 00:08:00.460
[CAVENDISH gasps]
My goodness.

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:02.665
He trusts me!

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.704
[gasps] Not only trust...

00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:11.583
Respect! Popularity!

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:17.160
So, Straw Hat is my fan!

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.003
A favor from a fan.

00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:25.912
Then I can't say no!

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:29.018
Bartolomeo is still
on the lower level.

00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.123
We could use his power.
Let's go find him.

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.710
Can you do anything? Leo?

00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:44.348
Those cuts look pretty ragged.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:47.421
If I can sew him up,
that's something.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.757
[MANSHERRY]
That could work.

00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.995
Then I can heal him.

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:53.366
My watering can
should fix him up.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.571
Good idea, Princess. Thank you.

00:08:55.604 --> 00:08:59.044
But first, we should all
get to safety like Lucy said.

00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:07.494
Kick-ass!
Mister Zoro is so cool!

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:11.168
That new special move
is outta this world!

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:15.276
[CAVENDISH] Hey, Bartolomeo!
Make me some stairs, quick!

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.449
I'll ride or die
for Mister Zoro!

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:20.888
Till the end of the line!

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:24.060
Are you listening
to me, you nitwit?

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.937
You're a part-time psycho
with narcolepsy!

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.208
I don't take orders from you!

00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:33.580
[CAVENDISH] Nico Robin
and the others need stairs!

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:34.883
Just do it already!

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:38.557
Huh? Wait a sec, didja say
it's for Miss Robin?

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.494
Be right there!

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:47.273
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:58.029
[panting]

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:01.235
You should stop
being so selfish.

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.473
You're wasting precious time.

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:08.717
Your poor friend Law is
suffering because he can't die!

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.656
Let me put him
out of his misery!

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:13.594
If you wanna kill him so bad,

00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:16.465
then you can do it
after you beat me!

00:10:16.498 --> 00:10:21.910
[LUFFY panting]

00:10:21.943 --> 00:10:24.147
Seems you're worn out already.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.352
Wouldn't you rather
just take a break?

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:28.056
You're as bad off as me!

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:30.828
I saw that special move
Traffy did before!

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:33.132
There's no way that
didn't mess you up!

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:36.105
[chuckles]

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:37.741
[grunts]

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:41.649
[yells]

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:46.527
[yells]

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.132
Bazooka!

00:10:53.473 --> 00:10:59.485
[panting]

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.990
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:02.758
[gasps]

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.864
You're fast, I'll give you that.

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:09.939
But your attacks don't have
nearly enough weight.

00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:12.377
Overheat!

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.186
[gasps]

00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:19.725
Brings back memories!

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:21.863
It was back when
you beat Crocodile.

00:11:21.897 --> 00:11:25.571
They tried to hide the truth,
but I figured out what happened.

00:11:25.604 --> 00:11:28.944
I've been keeping an
eye on you since then.

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:34.321
[DOFLAMINGO]
Crocodile was defeated?

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:38.329
And they're telling us
a captain from Navy HQ did it?

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:39.599
Not a chance.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.937
There must be a catch.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.976
[DOFLAMINGO]
Look. It's got to be him.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.482
Why else would his bounty
jump up like that?

00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:50.387
Find out about
this pirate group.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.291
I've never heard their name.

00:11:52.324 --> 00:11:55.429
Monkey "D."?

00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:59.405
[DOFLAMINGO] Then you
showed up at Marineford.

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:01.441
Falling from the sky!

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.428
You've done well
to survive this long,

00:12:11.461 --> 00:12:14.167
but your luck runs out today!

00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:25.256
[gasps]

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.180
[gasps]

00:12:37.214 --> 00:12:38.683
[LAW]
Stop!

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.387
I didn't expect you
to wake up yet.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.090
Are you all right?

00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:45.965
Put me down. Leave me here.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:47.333
[ROBIN, CAVENDISH gasp]

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.540
And why would you want that?

00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:55.149
[LAW]
For the past 13 years,

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:57.521
the only thing
I've been living for

00:12:57.554 --> 00:13:00.226
is a chance to kill Doflamingo.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:14.823
I've done everything I can.

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:17.360
But I'm all worn out.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:23.506
So now, all that's left
is to have faith in Straw Hat.

00:13:25.878 --> 00:13:32.156
But if he's gonna win,
then I wanna be there to watch.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.407
[LAW]
By the same token,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.214
if he doesn't win,
then I need to be there,

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.589
so that I can die
along with him.

00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:51.683
[LAW] I'm the one who
got Straw Hat involved

00:14:51.716 --> 00:14:54.053
in this whole conflict.

00:14:57.493 --> 00:15:02.203
That's why I have to
see it through. So leave me!

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:06.245
I don't know what to say.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:10.387
Traffy. Captains of
a true pirate alliance

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.223
are on equal footing.

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:17.502
[ROBIN] Luffy's here of
his own free will. You see?

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:21.174
If he didn't want
to fight, he'd refuse.

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:24.949
I'm begging you, please.

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:31.562
Leave me.

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:55.009
[sighs] I suppose there's
no talking you out of it.

I can't grant your request

00:16:17.588 --> 00:16:19.457
I'll stay here, too.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.032
[CAVENDISH] I don't want
to hear any complaints.

00:16:29.277 --> 00:16:34.856
Miss Robin! Hey!
Your stairs are ready!

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:37.728
We should go.
Bartolomeo is waiting.

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.464
He made a path.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:41.134
[CAVENDISH]
Go.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.507
Here, please.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.775
[gasps]

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:48.049
[CAVENDISH]
We can't all stay here.

00:16:48.082 --> 00:16:50.252
Leave Trafalgar to me.

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:56.298
I'll return this
the next time I see you.

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:06.051
[LEO] Robiland!
We're staying behind as well.

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:07.420
Don't worry.

00:17:07.454 --> 00:17:10.359
I promise Lawland will
make it back safe and sound.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.604
[USOPP] There's gotta be
some way to stop this!

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:19.177
Just sitting here watching
is driving me crazy!

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:29.030
Where are you going,
Sir Zoro? It's dangerous!

00:17:29.063 --> 00:17:30.801
Come with me!

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:32.571
Hey! Wait, Zoro!

00:17:32.604 --> 00:17:35.544
It would seem our friend
has a plan in mind!

00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:37.313
Let's make haste!

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:42.256
Mingo!

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.462
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.670
[grunts]

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.151
[LUFFY yells]

00:17:57.487 --> 00:17:59.725
[yells]

00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:08.776
[LUFFY yells]

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:17.360
[yells]

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.337
[laughs]

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.506
[gasps]

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:33.826
[chuckles]

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.335
That was close!

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.652
All right! Second Gear!

00:18:47.286 --> 00:18:50.860
[yells] Gum-Gum...

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:57.273
...Red Hawk!

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:07.694
[LUFFY yells]

00:19:12.437 --> 00:19:13.139
[gasps]

00:19:13.172 --> 00:19:15.009
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:18.616
Damn it! Then how about this?

00:19:23.893 --> 00:19:27.133
Now. Third Gear!

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.470
Let's go!

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:35.650
Gum-Gum Grizzly Magnum!

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:40.828
[DOFLAMINGO]
You're wide open!

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:41.896
[gasps]

00:19:53.486 --> 00:19:57.661
[DOFLAMINGO] Trying to hurry so
Law's attack won't go to waste?

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:05.710
But even if you do defeat me,
how long will that take?

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:12.758
[panting]

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.766
There's a one hour limit,
but it's not that simple.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:21.007
That's how long until
the Birdcage fully collapses.

00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:33.465
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:42.016
[screams]

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:43.219
[LUFFY gasps]

00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:44.622
But you have to think,
there's plenty of

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:48.195
sick and elderly people
out there, and babies as well.

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:50.734
Not everyone can run.

00:20:50.768 --> 00:20:52.938
[chuckles]

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:57.982
The vulnerable will
fall victim quickly, I'm sure.

00:20:58.015 --> 00:20:59.417
It will only take 30 minutes

00:20:59.451 --> 00:21:02.958
for the fatalities
to start piling up.

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:04.996
After 40 minutes have passed,

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:08.703
I imagine we'll be able to
hear the screams close by.

00:21:08.736 --> 00:21:13.847
Then after 50 minutes,
the kingdom will be painted red,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.521
as if it were covered
in crushed tomatoes.

00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:23.198
And then the screams
will die out.

00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:27.674
Just one hour until
only silence remains.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.716
[DOFLAMINGO] You have nothing
to do with this kingdom.

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.689
You don't owe
these people anything.

00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:38.896
And yet the deaths today rest
entirely on your shoulders.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.305
They would still be smiling
if you hadn't come here.

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:46.444
My kingdom would
still be at peace.

00:21:46.478 --> 00:21:50.085
That wasn't peace!
It was all built on lies!

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.674
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:22:00.707 --> 00:22:04.347
There's no place in the world
where everyone prospers.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.353
It's a waste of time
trying to save them all.

00:22:07.386 --> 00:22:09.357
You're just a pirate,
passing through.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.996
Why are you trying to play hero?

00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:15.002
You dare pick a fight
with me, Straw Hat?

00:22:15.035 --> 00:22:16.104
That's not true!

00:22:16.137 --> 00:22:18.943
You're the one
picking a fight with me!

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:23.586
You made so many
of my friends cry.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.692
And you made
my crewmates angry, too!

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:34.609
You'll keep hurting people
until you're stopped.

00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:36.713
It's time for me to step up.

00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:40.052
I won't let anyone else die!

00:22:48.636 --> 00:22:52.944
[LUFFY] I'm kicking your ass
and wrecking your Birdcage!

00:23:04.969 --> 00:23:09.110
All right. Fourth Gear!

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:16.726
[NARRATOR] Luffy reveals
his secret weapon,

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:19.363
a new form that
surpasses Third Gear.

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.268
With overwhelming
strength and speed,

00:23:21.301 --> 00:23:23.438
even Doflamingo
struggles to keep up.

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:26.044
However, the clock is still
ticking for Dressrosa,

00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:28.282
and Luffy must turn
things around quickly

00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:30.620
if he hopes to
protect its citizens.

00:23:30.654 --> 00:23:32.189
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.596 --> 00:23:38.703
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
