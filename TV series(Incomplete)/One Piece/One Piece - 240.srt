00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,620
[KOKORO]
You're right.

176
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:23,190
An assassination plot falls more
in line with the work of CP-9.

177
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,793
Isn't that right, Blueno?
Ever heard of 'em?

178
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,628
[BLUENO] Eh...
Only rumors, really.

179
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,597
Geez, you village
simpletons sure put

180
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,165
a lot of stock
into stories about

181
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,601
imaginary boogeyman-
shadow-organizations.

182
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,370
[KOKORO] Don't be an idiot.
Of course they exist.

183
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,572
They just never show themselves.

184
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,475
Can't really work undercover
if everyone knows who you are.

185
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,583
You seem pretty
sure of yourself.

186
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,720
Got some kind of
proof about this?

187
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,789
Nope. Just rumors.
Nyahahaha!

188
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,791
Stop screwing around, hag!

189
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,127
Look, rumors are
superstitious nonsen--

190
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,464
Strange they've remained a
rumor for such a long time, huh?

191
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,434
They're good at eliminating
people without anyone noticing.

192
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,204
If you mess with them,
you're dead meat.

193
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:17,044
Nyah! Hahahaha!

194
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,746
[SAHDOWED FIGURE]
Impressive work.

195
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,183
The assignment we had to
do yesterday went very well.

196
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,785
Excellent job, Nico Robin.

197
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,291
Thanks. It was a cakewalk.

198
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,558
[SAHDOWED FIGURE]
Though, naturally,

199
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,693
you're now being pursued

200
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,429
by every last
person in the city.

201
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,463
[ROBIN]
Indeed, I am.

202
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,767
[SHADOWED FIGURE]
Merely a temporary setback.

203
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,804
Tonight is what's
important. Understand?

204
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,141
We'll infiltrate Iceberg's
residence one more time.

205
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,276
If it becomes a
worst-case scenario,

206
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,513
you're free to eliminate
all of the evidence.

207
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,648
Among Tom's apprentices
who could've had it

208
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,250
from the very beginning,

209
00:11:56,283 --> 00:12:00,287
Iceberg is the only
one that remains alive.

210
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,556
No matter how much
he denies having it,

211
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,328
in the name of CP9,
we will take it tonight.

212
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:11,031
Never forget--this is
a mission of justice.

213
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,119
[ELEVATOR GIRL A]
In compliance with

214
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,220
the Aqua Laguna warning

215
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,156
that was issued for the
entire island earlier today:

216
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,459
all docks on the
shipbuilding island are now

217
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:42,663
to be considered public
shelter and evacuation centers.

218
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,131
Large crowds are expected,

219
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:48,168
so please take shelter
as quickly as possible.

220
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,237
Additionally, keep
in mind that Dock 1

221
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,207
is currently in
a dangerous state.

222
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,709
[CITIZEN A] All right,
I'll put the iron board on.

223
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,246
Hey Honey, you sure we
have everything we'll need?

224
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,481
Yes... Now, come on.

225
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,716
We need to take
shelter in the shipyard.

226
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,385
Yeah, Dad!
Let's get going!

227
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,586
C'mon! Hurry!

228
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,121
[CITIZEN A]
Patience, patience!

229
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,456
You gotta be careful
sealing this board.

230
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,258
If the inside of our
house gets flooded,

231
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,560
everything will be ruined.

232
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,130
[CITIZEN C] Tie that
side down, too! Move it!

233
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,799
[CITIZEN B] Hey! The wind
is starting to pick up!

234
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:20,768
The waves will be
here anytime now!

235
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,803
Hurry! If we take too long,

236
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,472
those assassin pirates
are gonna show up, too!

237
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,207
What?

238
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,642
Where'd he disappear to?

239
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,711
[CRAFTSMAN B]
I'm sure he went this way!

240
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,446
[CRAFTSMAN C]
He's gotta be around here!

241
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,381
[CRAFTSMAN A] Okay.
You guys look over there!

242
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,749
[CRAFTSMAN B]
Right!

243
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,358
[thinking]
What the hell is going on?

244
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:48,361
Why're they chasing me?
I don't understand!

245
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,572
Wait a sec! Is this why
everybody's after me?

246
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,574
"Culprits in the
assassination plot"?

247
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,708
Well that sucks.

248
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,378
Can't go back to the inn now...
I'll be out in the open.

249
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,248
Hey! Who goes
there? Who are you?

250
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,517
Over here! There's a suspicious
guy hiding in the alley!

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,486
You sure about this?
There's no mistake?

252
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,821
I'm certain!

253
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,289
They've been
staying here at the inn

254
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,790
since they
checked in last night!

255
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,159
They took off just
a little while ago.

256
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,194
They're staying here?!

257
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,295
Yes, that's right!

258
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,797
They still have lots of
luggage left in their room.

259
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,334
I'm sure they'll be
back for it sometime.

260
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,803
Right! You guys
stay here, okay?

261
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,439
The rest of you, search the
surrounding area with me.

262
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,642
Look sharp!
Leave no stone unturned.

263
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,776
Does everybody got it?

264
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,777
[GROUP]
Yeah!

265
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,758
[CRAFTSMAN F]
Huh. No one's here.

266
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,661
Are you one hundred percent
certain that this is their ship?

267
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,130
There's no mistaking it!
Look up there!

268
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,799
That's the flag of
the Straw Hat pirates!

269
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:02,102
They probably
already abandoned her.

270
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,170
She's all worn out.

271
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,410
[CRAFTSMAN I]
Did you find them?

272
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,211
[CRAFTSMAN J]
No. They're gone.

273
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,813
[CRAFTSMAN F] There's
not much left on board.

274
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:15,349
I'm pretty sure she was
abandoned and left to sink.

275
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,284
Let's keep looking around.

276
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,197
[thinking]
Who were those guys?

277
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,170
Is there something
going on in the city?

278
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,540
[CRAFTSMAN K]
Find anything?

279
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:40,407
[CRAFTSMAN L]
Not a trace of them.

280
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,542
[CRAFTSMAN K]
Dammit! Where are they?

281
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,549
They sure are persistent.

282
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,417
Hey, Luffy?

283
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,419
Huh? What is it, Nami?

284
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,355
Do you think
everybody's okay?

285
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,490
These guys are
all over the place!

286
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,192
Chopper and Sanji
are probably safe

287
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,562
because no one knows
their faces yet, but still.

288
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,763
Come on, we need to hurry!

289
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,164
[NAMI]
Right!

290
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,038
It looks like the sea
train's still in operation.

291
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,540
I guess the noon
departure has already left.

292
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,276
There's another one
scheduled for tonight,

293
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,411
even in all this bad weather.

294
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:20,547
The 11 PM, leaving
for Enies Lobby.

295
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,549
That sea train is
pretty impressive.

296
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,551
[CRAFTSMAN M] Hey!
Any news on those pirates?

297
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,685
[CRAFTSMAN N]
We've got nothing!

298
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,755
[CRAFTSMAN O] If we can
capture just one of those three

299
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:29,223
from the wanted posters,

300
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,125
we'll make 'em cough
up who the others are.

301
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,460
[CRAFTSMAN M] Hurry!
Before the waves get too high!

302
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,629
[CHOPPER]
Maybe we can't find Robin

303
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,198
because she got
on the sea train.

304
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,134
Well, if she did that
would make things

305
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,236
worse than they already are.

306
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,106
Water 7's too big an
area to cover on its own.

307
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,307
What if...

308
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,243
What if I did something to upset
her back at the bookstore?

309
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,745
[SANJI] Don't be ridiculous.
No way that's the reason.

310
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,247
Hey! Excuse me!

311
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,214
Have you seen a
beautiful woman

312
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,449
who kind of looks like this?

313
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:56,350
[CITIZEN D]
You mean the one who's

314
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,285
about 20 years older
than that picture?

315
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,620
If I had, I would've
told the newspapers

316
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,556
or the Galley-La
Company about it.

317
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,425
[CITIZEN D] To think
she's an assassin.

318
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,760
Kind of shocking, huh?

319
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,363
I admire you for trying to
track down that criminal,

320
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,799
but I suggest you find
yourself some shelter soon.

321
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,768
Aqua Laguna is on its way!

322
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,469
Take care!

323
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,578
Things are getting
dangerous around here.

324
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,814
What about the others?
Think they're okay?

325
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,415
I'm sure Luffy's fine.

326
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,651
Nami's the one that I'm
really worried about right now.

327
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:36,257
[SANJI] At any rate, this city's
becoming quite the ghost town.

328
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,159
[CHOPPER]
The wind's really picking up.

329
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,528
I'm sure most people
are already in the shelter.

330
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,331
Where could she be?!

331
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,600
Hey! Robin!

332
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,335
Where are you?!

333
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,106
[thinking]
That scent! Is it?

334
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,112
Huh? Chopper! What is it?

335
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,212
Chopper?

336
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,383
Hey! Wait for me!

337
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,652
[thinking]
I'm close!

338
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:09,189
Chopper! Wait up!
What's going on, dammit?

339
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,791
[thinking]
This way!

340
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,828
Hey, Chopper!

341
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,296
Chopper!

342
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,666
Oo... Waaah!!

343
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:22,403
[tumbling sounds
followed by a thud]

344
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,104
Are you all right?

345
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,173
[SANJI]
Chopper! Did you hurt yourself?

346
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,276
There you are!

347
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,145
You can't just go
running off like that!

348
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,113
What in the hell is
the matter with you?

349
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:37,217
One second, you're
right beside me.

350
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,554
I knew it! Look!

351
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,259
[CHOPPER] Robin!
[SANJI] It's Robin!

352
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,628
Robin! Where in the
world have you been?

353
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:48,529
Everyone's worried!

354
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,764
We've been looking
for you everywhere!

355
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,833
Come on! Let's head
back to the inn!

356
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,635
A lot's happened
while you were gone.

357
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,670
I'll explain
everything on the way.

358
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:59,139
This damn
water's split us up.

359
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,576
Hold on! I'll find
another way over there!

360
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:05,679
Don't bother. It's all right.

361
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,415
Stay where you are.

362
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,117
There's no need.

363
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,487
Because I won't be coming
back to you and your crew.

364
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,791
We're parting ways
here in this city.

365
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:18,725
What the?

366
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,295
What in the world
are you talking about?

367
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,796
Oh wait, you mean
that stuff they said

368
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,200
about you in the newspaper?
Don't worry about it!

369
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,301
None of us believes it.

370
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:30,170
Pirates are falsely accused
of crimes all the time.

371
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,239
We're easy targets.

372
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,674
[ROBIN]
About that.

373
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,276
I apologize for pinning such

374
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,311
an unreasonable
crime on all of you.

375
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,313
But as far as my involvement...

376
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,049
Everything that was said
in the newspaper is true.

377
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,251
Late last night, I broke
into the mayor's place

378
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,020
of residence and shot him.

379
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,790
No way.

380
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:54,228
Inside me, I carry a darkness
that none of you know about.

381
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:58,832
One day, that darkness
will be the end of all of you.

382
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,135
[AOKIJI] Every organization
that she's had something

383
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:04,171
to do with in the past
has been annihilated.

384
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:08,409
Not one single, solitary
member escaped, except for her.

385
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:10,811
[ROBIN] I'm afraid you'll
be taking the fall

386
00:20:10,844 --> 00:20:12,546
for last night's attack
while I escape.

387
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,081
And let me warn you.

388
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,617
The situation
will only get worse.

389
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,219
What are you talking about?!
I don't understand!

390
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,654
[ROBIN]
Why I'm doing it?

391
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,423
There's no need for
you to understand.

392
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,694
Robin! What happened?

393
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,795
You're not making any sense!

394
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,663
This isn't like you at all!

395
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,799
Please! We'll work
this out together!

396
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,370
Although I only spent
a short time with you,

397
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,472
from this day forward.

398
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:42,042
We will never see
each other again.

399
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,411
Thank you for all of the
kindness you've shown me.

400
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,115
Know that I'll never forget it.

401
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:49,516
Goodbye.

402
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,276
[SANJI]
Wait...

403
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:18,312
No... please...

404
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,679
This can't...

405
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:24,318
This can't be happening.

406
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:26,720
Hey!

407
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,189
Come back!

408
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:36,230
[SANJI] Stop! You don't know
what you're saying! Robin!

409
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:39,432
Wait! Please! Come back!

410
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:57,585
Robin!

411
00:21:57,618 --> 00:22:02,622
♪ ending song ♪

412
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,329
[ZORO] We need to settle
this once and for all.

413
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,598
Is Robin our friend,
or is she our enemy?

414
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:20,334
[NAMI] Wait! Hold on!
It's that masked man!

415
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,603
I bet he's responsible
for what's come over her!

416
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:23,704
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, that's it!

417
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,073
He's forcing her to do
bad things against her will!

418
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,541
[ZORO] That's a
positive way to look at it.

419
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,176
But if this guy is
really Robin's friend,

420
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,444
then we've got a problem.
