hear what Nami said?

00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,160
Plenty of treasure
will fall into your lap

178
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,196
once you gain power.

179
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,063
[LUFFY]
You're wrong.

180
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,365
A real pirate has
a different dream.

181
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,068
To become the
greatest man on the sea.

182
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,707
And I'm going to be
King of the Pirates someday!

183
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,243
Luffy!

184
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,345
Damn it!

185
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,719
No one has ever dared defy me
and then lived to tell about it!

186
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,421
I'll blow you both away!

187
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,422
[IAN]
Please, Captain, wait!

188
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,757
[FLIP]
Father, what about me?

189
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,192
[WETTON]
What do I care?

190
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,828
Oh no!

191
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:22,935
What the?

192
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,937
What's going on in there?

193
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,880
The Rainbow Tower!

194
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,748
It's collapsing.

195
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:46,926
Damn it.

196
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,128
What the hell is going on now?

197
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,264
[IAN]
He abandoned us.

198
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,365
Wetton, damn you!

199
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,201
No real pirate captain would
do something like that.

200
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,369
No way!

201
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,538
Luffy!

202
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,472
[PUKAU]
Rapa Nui!

203
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,907
[RONGO]
It's Rapa Nui!

204
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,141
[AKIBI]
He came back to us!

205
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,776
[ISOKA]
Oh, thank goodness.

206
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,977
Rapa Nui!

207
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,878
Oh, man.

208
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,214
I was worried about him too.

209
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,282
I'm sick of this mayor.

210
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,484
How big a pain, can one guy be?

211
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,819
What? What the...?

212
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,256
Huh?

213
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,491
It can't be!

214
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,425
Professor?

215
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,493
This isn't good at all.

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,229
Ape's Concert maintains
only a very delicate balance

217
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,497
to begin with.

218
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,433
If you set off an explosion like
that one in a place like this,

219
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,969
there's no telling what
might happen next.

220
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,804
[screams]

221
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,273
[ZORO]
What is that?

222
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,509
[HENZO] The warping of space
and time is expanding quickly.

223
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,911
At this rate,
we'll get caught up in it.

224
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,313
And we'll all die!

225
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,180
[USOPP]
What?

226
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,015
How did this happen?

227
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,086
The Rainbow Tower has
completely sunk below the water.

228
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,693
[WETTON]
Damn.

229
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,928
The tower was
never totally finished.

230
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,196
It wasn't strong
enough for this.

231
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,531
But that doesn't matter now.

232
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,200
Every last little bit of the
treasure will be mine.

233
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,970
My men aren't going to be
able to come after me now.

234
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,807
[laughs]

235
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,626
The sky's falling fast.

236
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,495
There isn't much time,
maybe an hour tops.

237
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,697
[USOPP] All right,
we have to get out of here!

238
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,467
[NAMI]
Yeah, but how do we do that?

239
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,370
The author of this book
once visited Ape's Concert,

240
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,471
so let's look through it.

241
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,173
He must talk about the way
out somewhere in here.

242
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:41,641
[gasps]

243
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,242
What's wrong?

244
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,012
It must be in the
next volume, though.

245
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,180
You have it, right?

246
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,249
Oh crap!

247
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,218
Huh?

248
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,487
What now?

249
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,688
Look, over there.

250
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,856
Huh?

251
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,525
[RAPA NUI] That light over
there, it's the setting sun!

252
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:00,593
[USOPP]
The sun?

253
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,827
[RAPA NUI]
That's right.

254
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,530
The light of the sun is shining
through a crack in space.

255
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,167
Luffy and I followed that light
earlier and we ended up outside.

256
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,701
You did?

257
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,769
We need to hurry.

258
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,405
That light could be
disappearing at any time now!

259
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,406
Unfurl the sails.

260
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,675
And everyone, row the
oars as hard as you can!

261
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,676
Right!

262
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,377
Why don't you guys
come give us a hand, too.

263
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,112
We're trying to
get out of here now.

264
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,414
[FLIP]
Okay.

265
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,025
What are you doing?
Row right, okay?

266
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,227
We are rowing right, thank you!

267
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,575
Look you guys, the light
is starting to disappear.

268
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,410
So this is how it ends.

269
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,312
You guys get off and
push us from behind.

270
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,447
You're crazy!

271
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,582
If you all kick your feet
really hard it might work.

272
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,150
No way!

273
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,587
What we really need
is a tailwind to blow us

274
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,457
So all that you
need is some wind?

275
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,125
Hold on! What are you planning?

276
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,094
I'm gonna blow up our ship.

277
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,097
It was originally a
Marine ship, after all.

278
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,099
So it's fully loaded
with explosives.

279
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,266
If I light those,

280
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,335
the explosion should give
you a pretty good tailwind.

281
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,236
You can't!

282
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,437
Wait, Rapa Nui!

283
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,672
Don't do it!

284
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,274
If you blow up the ship, then
what's going to happen to you?

285
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,313
This is my treasure, all mine!

286
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,316
It was worth all
the years as mayor.

287
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,628
[SANJI] Hey, our friends were
somewhere inside that mist.

288
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,830
Would you like to explain
what happened to 'em?

289
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,167
You better not tell me you're
the only one who came back out.

290
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,137
Answer me.

291
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,274
Damn it.

292
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,710
Hey, you, come back here!

293
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,619
[RONGO]
Rapa Nui!

294
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,319
[USOPP]
Hey!

295
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,154
What're you doing?

296
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:08,821
Come back here!

297
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,488
We can't do that.

298
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,357
We're Pumpkin Pirates, too!

299
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,324
We're all friends.

300
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,627
We swore we would live
and die together.

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,195
They're going.

302
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,130
Rapa Nui is planning
on blowing up the ship

303
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,698
because he wants
to save us all!

304
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,667
Don't let his sacrifice
be for nothing!

305
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,669
Do you all want to die?

306
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,838
No, we aren't going to die.

307
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,572
[HENZO]
Hmm?

308
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,573
Henzo.

309
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,176
I promise you that
we're going to come back.

310
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,879
Whatever happens, we're
coming back to Luluka somehow!

311
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,881
Isoka.

312
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,683
[WETTON] You better not be
thinking you won't answer

313
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,652
for assaulting
the mayor like this.

314
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,686
You'll have to pay.

315
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,589
The "hitting the mayor" tax
is 90 million Berries.

316
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,757
Are you okay with that?

317
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,491
[SANJI]
Yeah, sure.

318
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,827
It doesn't really matter to me.

319
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,397
I'll just skip
out on it, anyway.

320
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,866
But how? Paying taxes is a duty!

321
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,269
Pirates aren't exactly regular
tax‐paying citizens you know.

322
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,737
[WETTON]
Well, yeah, that's true.

323
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,272
Sanji!

324
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,740
The mist is disappearing.

325
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:02,675
Do you see?

326
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,210
What?

327
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,579
Oh no.

328
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,380
What's gonna happen
to Luffy and the others now?

329
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,550
[WETTON laughs]
Now none of them can come back

330
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,685
from Ape's Concert!

331
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,719
Not ever!

332
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,455
No matter what you
people try, you can't beat me!

333
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,593
I am Mayor Wetton, and you are
completely powerless to stop me!

334
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,363
[laughs]

335
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,745
Huh? Sanji!

336
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:40,546
What the‐‐?!

337
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,147
No way!

338
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,948
The Going Merry!

339
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,917
I hope everyone is okay.

340
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,860
My mansion!

341
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:33,299
Everything I own is being sucked
away into the sky by that thing!

342
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,449
‐‐Nami!
‐‐Hey, guys!

343
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,283
[USOPP]
Oh, look at it!

344
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,985
My precious ship
has been injured!

345
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,820
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji, long time no see!

346
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,989
[SANJI]
Nami dear!

347
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,458
[NAMI]
I'm so annoyed I could scream.

348
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,961
But why, Nami dear?

349
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,996
All of the treasure she had
on deck got blown away.

350
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,230
And she isn't
taking it very well.

351
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,133
So I wouldn't get too close to
her right now if I were you.

352
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,805
[PASQUA] All right,
pirates, that's far enough!

353
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,906
[SANJI]
Marines!

354
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,342
[USOPP] And it's the same
ones who were chasing us.

355
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,144
Please help us, sir!

356
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,379
These people are
terrible criminals!

357
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,483
They've stolen everything that
our town's great mayor owns.

358
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,186
Let's see. This is
the ring of Princess Illusia.

359
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,388
It was stolen by
pirates years ago,

360
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,057
and here it is, sitting
on your finger now.

361
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,258
Why do you have this?

362
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,760
Well, you see, uh...

363
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,762
[PASQUA] You didn't steal it,
now did you?

364
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,997
[FLIP]
No, of course not!

365
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,166
This was a treasure that was
resting inside Ape's Concert.

366
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,234
[LAKE]
Yes, yes, he's right.

367
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,837
We just pulled it out of
the shipwreck, that's all!

368
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,339
I see. So what you're saying
then is that this ring here

369
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,108
doesn't belong to anyone.

370
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:49,875
[LAKE, FLIP]
What?

371
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:50,909
Major.

372
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,845
We've discovered a
substantial pile of treasure

373
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,513
that we believe
was carried out of there.

374
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,614
Right.

375
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,449
Well then, the Marines
will be confiscating all of it.

376
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,617
Hold it!

377
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,220
You'd better not so much
as lay a finger on my treasure!

378
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:01,887
It's mine!

379
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,388
All of it!

380
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,522
Mine!

381
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,423
Any treasure that is
found without an official owner

382
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,859
is the property of
the World Government.

383
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,760
And if it's obtained illegally,

384
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,195
that will be considered
an act of piracy.

385
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,063
Fine with me!

386
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,865
I'm really a pirate, anyway!

387
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,367
Anything I want
I can just take by force!

388
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,436
Look out.

389
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,571
Let's consider that
your confession, shall we?

390
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,107
If that's okay with you,
Pirate Captain Wetton.

391
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,542
[WETTON]
Wait, what?

392
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,485
No. No, it can't be.

393
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,457
Rapa Nui!

394
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,259
No way!

395
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,295
[ISOKA] I promised we'd
come back to Luluka, didn't I?

396
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,397
[HENZO]
Isoka!

397
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, take Wetton's
gang into custody.

398
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,168
Right.

399
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,075
You're alive,
and you're a lot older.

400
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,443
How'd that happen?

401
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,111
When the explosion happened,
we were thrown

402
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,847
into the outside world,
just like all of you were.

403
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,182
Except there was
one little difference:

404
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,584
We ended up in the
world of 50 years ago.

405
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,519
I see. The Rainbow Mist
must have warped

406
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,022
the axis of time
as well as space.

407
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,925
Then why didn't you
come here sooner?

408
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,293
We knew that we needed
to figure out a way

409
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,161
to defeat and punish Wetton.

410
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,429
I thought that we'd
need help though,

411
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,332
so we all decided to
enlist with the Marines.

412
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,467
To use their power.

413
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,602
But earning a high enough
rank to have the authority

414
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,538
to come here at will took
more time than I'd expected.

415
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,474
It makes sense now.

416
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,642
I may be wearing the
uniform of the Marines,

417
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,346
but in my heart, I am still a
Pumpkin Pirate to the death.

418
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,013
Henzo.

419
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,216
I'm still your friend, too.

420
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,120
Forever under the same flag.

421
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,388
Rapa.

422
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,132
Also, I may have forgotten to
mention this to the Straw Hats,

423
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,134
but you're all under arrest.

424
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,969
[USOPP]
You're heartless!

425
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,338
You still owe me for feeding
you that time, you jerk!

426
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,539
Remember?

427
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,242
[PASQUA] As a Marine, I'm
charged with upholding justice.

428
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,245
I can't just let a pirate with a
bounty on his head get away.

429
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,246
However...

430
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,347
It can't be!

431
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,315
Right now we have got
to take Wetton and his crew

432
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,650
back to Marine Headquarters.

433
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,718
But if we do that,

434
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,486
the Straw Hat Pirates
will be able to slip away!

435
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,189
They are just too much
for us to handle now!

436
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,657
What are we going to do?

437
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
I know!

438
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,360
Request assistance from
the Marine base at once!

439
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,995
But no, they won't
arrive until tomorrow

440
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,096
or the next day at the earliest.

441
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,431
That will give the pirates
plenty of time to escape!

442
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,000
Ah damn it.

443
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:32,171
Ahh! I guess there's
nothing I can do now!

444
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,506
Very convincing, isn't he?

445
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,378
[HENZO] We can't do
any permanent repairs

446
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,413
to the ship right away.

447
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,348
But we can make some
emergency adjustments

448
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,019
to keep the water out, at least.

449
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:52,024
Thank you so much Luffy,
and all of your friends as well.

450
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,059
Now my years of
research and invention

451
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,460
can finally come to an end.

452
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,029
[MASTER]
We can't have that.

453
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,463
There's no telling
when the Rainbow Mist

454
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,532
is gonna appear out
of the blue again, right?

455
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,533
With that thing out there,

456
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,102
we'll never feel
completely safe on the sea.

457
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,537
We'd like you to make us gear,

458
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,607
so that we can avoid
being sucked into the mist.

459
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,311
I would be happy to.

460
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,755
[PASQUA] Inside the Rainbow Mist
is a land of eternity.

461
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,225
It has neither
daytime nor nighttime.

462
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,662
One will never
become sick or old.

463
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,398
The sea shines like
a sparkling emerald,

464
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:38,003
and the sky envelops the
area like a warm blanket.

465
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,173
The countless ships that became
trapped inside the Rainbow Mist

466
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,243
had immeasurable treasure
resting within them.

467
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:49,748
It was truly the last paradise
remaining anywhere in the world.

468
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,783
We ruled that land of eternity.

469
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,151
It was ours.

470
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,653
We routed the
pirates that invaded

471
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,122
and kept peace in paradise.

472
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,158
Our name was
the Pumpkin Pirates!

473
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,794
I'm writing this book to record
the many unusual adventures

474
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,531
that we had while we dwelled
inside the Rainbow Mist.

475
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,469
I hope that this volume
will help the adventurers

476
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,171
who will visit this
land in the future.

477
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,381
And so, this book is dedicated
to the people whose debt

478
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,118
we are in for having
led us back into the world.

479
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,453
The Straw Hat Pirates.

480
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,159
You know what that place
was pretty awesome, wasn't it?

481
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,129
Uh. I think I've had enough
of that ship graveyard.

482
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,797
[LUFFY] Well, it's not
like I wanna live there,

483
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,532
but it would be nice to visit.

484
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,668
[CHOPPER] I can't believe
you actually enjoyed that.

485
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,502
Is that rain?

486
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,470
No way. This ain't rain.

487
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,408
That's interesting.

488
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,810

Our Log Pose is broken!

It's just stuck
