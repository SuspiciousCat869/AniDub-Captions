1
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,158
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,495
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,332
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,303
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,506
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,607
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,044
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,446
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,683
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,120
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,322
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,260
Wait!

13
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,664
You didn't press
that button, did you?

14
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,780
The silver transponder
snail has received a signal!

15
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,682
It's an emergency!

16
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,250
A Buster Call has been requested

17
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,686
under the authority
of Admiral Aokiji!

18
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,621
What's the location?

19
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,822
Enies Lobby!

20
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,292
Contact the five Vice Admirals
closest to that location!

21
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,361
All things considered,

22
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,730
it may be faster to reach
there from headquarters.

23
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,098
How long, then?

24
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,367
No more than
thirty minutes, sir.

25
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,303
In that case, prepare ten
battleships for departure

26
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,106
and inform the Vice Admirals
of the situation.

27
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,073
Make it quick!

28
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,210
Yes sir! A Buster Call
has been requested!

29
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,112
The destination is Enies Lobby!

30
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,014
Prepare ten battleships
for sail immediately!

31
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,118
Hello? Hello?

32
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,653
What is it, Chief?

33
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,321
Oh, now I get through.

34
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,257
This is the one
I was trying to use.

35
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,125
Not that it matters anymore.

36
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,660
There's no turning back now.

37
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,395
I pushed the button.

38
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:30,170
Of all things! I triggered
the Buster Call!

39
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,805
Everyone get off
the island! Hurry!

40
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,408
A Buster call has been
invoked on Enies Lobby!

41
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,676
If you don't get away

42
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,511
from here immediately,
you'll die!

43
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,512
Hey!

44
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,047
Don't tell them things
they don't need to know!

45
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,058
We're gonna get hit
with a Buster Call!

46
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,325
Battleships are coming!

47
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,263
Get away from Enies Lobby!

48
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,099
Hey, wait a second!

49
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,636
If that was Robin talking,
then where is she?

50
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,505
Right behind these
doors, of course.

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,348
As you seem to have surmised,

52
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,416
you'll have to go
through me first.

53
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,582
Outta my way.

54
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:52,119
I'm not gonna let you keep
me from Robin any longer.

55
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,189
Say what you like.
This is the end.

56
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,691
You'll never see her again.

57
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,528
I made a promise, and
I'm not gonna break it.

58
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,463
I'm coming for you, Robin!

59
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,637
"Five Namis? Nami Strikes
Back with Mirages!"

60
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,222
Hey. Get up.

61
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,157
I don't have time
for this. C'mon.

62
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,295
Don't you dare
give me that look!

63
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,264
Swallow your pride and
cancel the Buster Call!

64
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,199
Now, before it's too late!

65
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,434
Give it up!

66
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,670
You're still going
on about that crap?

67
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,807
As the Chief of CP9,
I have a reputation to uphold!

68
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,410
"Whoopsie, silly me!
I take it back!

69
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,744
Cancel the Buster Call!"

70
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,747
Oh yeah, that's gonna
go over real well!

71
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,618
I don't care how many
useless peons die out there.

72
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,154
All I know is one thing,
once I hand you

73
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,622
over to the World Government,

74
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,657
I'll get a nice,
pretty promotion!

75
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,293
That's all that matters, right?

76
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,629
You're a fool.

77
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,064
You've already lost.

78
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,465
Excuse me?

79
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:15,769
Luffy, and everyone else,
they're coming for me.

80
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,105
Rather optimistic,
wouldn't you say?

81
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,773
Even if I hadn't
made the Buster Call,

82
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,542
you'd still be finished!

83
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,545
Your little friend is
up against Rob Lucci.

84
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,113
Do you really think he can win,

85
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,317
against a CP9 Agent with
a power level of 4000?

86
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,685
In other words,
he can completely

87
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:34,588
crush what little
hope you have left.

88
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,790
So I don't care how
many friends you've got.

89
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,193
I don't even care
about the Buster Call.

90
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,129
The point is you're screwed
no matter what happens!

91
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,697
Do you understand?

92
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,007
I won't give up.

93
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,287
Robin!

94
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,624
It's a Buster Call!

95
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:51,825
The battleships are coming!

96
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,360
If we don't get moving,

97
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,596
they're gonna
burn us to a crisp!

98
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,131
Run away!

99
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,273
Look, it's all crooked!

100
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,477
Hey, where is everybody, anyway?

101
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,147
I was excited about showing
them the secret passage.

102
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,019
Sounds like they're
having a party over there.

103
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,688
Chimney, Gonbe!

104
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,157
There you are!
What're you up to?

105
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,624
Oh, hey Granny!

106
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,262
Guess what, guess what!

107
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,430
We found a weird
hole in the wall,

108
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:33,500
and then we took the pirate
guy there to check it out,

109
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,270
and then he blew a
hole through a door

110
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,072
and got super duper tiny!

111
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,472
He what?

112
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,178
But before that he
was all like kapow!

113
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,412
Kapow?

114
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,485
Right?

115
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,123
Wow, that's some story
you've got there!

116
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,460
Well, I can't say
I quite understand,

117
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,796
but either way it sounds like
things're getting pretty crazy!

118
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,236
Seems we've finally
reached the climax.

119
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,539
I'd better hurry.

120
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,175
If I stay here,
I could die as well.

121
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,648
If you're gonna run, then
leave the key here with me.

122
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,084
Shave! You must forgive me.

123
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,721
Alas, I fear the
game must end now.

124
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,696
Hey! Let me go!

125
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:50,243
At the very least, please
accept this parting gift.

126
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,286
Golden Bubbles!

127
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:10,664
Damn it.

128
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:13,700
It's the same thing
she did to Sanji.

129
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,775
I can't pick up the Clima Takt.

130
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:27,681
I'm too slippery.
I can't even stand up!

131
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,587
Look at this mess!
What did you do?

132
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,657
Well, I admit this
look doesn't exactly

133
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,661
do wonders for your curves,
but your skin is quite nice.

134
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,831
Although there is one catch.

135
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:47,167
Your already pathetic
strength has been cut in half.

136
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,137
I'd give up on the
key if I were you.

137
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,139
Yeah right. You wish!

138
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,674
Cool Charge!

139
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,214
Stop wasting
my time. It's no use.

140
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,316
Tempest Kick!

141
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,419
Huh?

142
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,389
I call it "Mirage Tempo".

143
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,090
I'm over here, by the way.

144
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,158
How dare you!

145
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,727
Don't toy with me!
Finger Pistol!

146
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,069
They're all fakes?
Where did you go?

147
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,436
I'm right here!

148
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,378
What is that?

149
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,414
She turned into a monster?

150
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,048
Huh?

151
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:40,120
So you have devil fruit
powers as well, do you?

152
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,255
What a ditz.

153
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,375
Hurry, before the
Buster Call starts!

154
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,143
You don't gotta tell me twice!

155
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,413
I'll make you face the wrath
of the mighty Nose Storm!

156
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,783
Tempest Kick!

157
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,551
Finger Pistol!

158
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,093
Good. Now keep it up.

159
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:21,629
Finger Pistol!

160
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,196
Tempest Kick!

161
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,365
Not again!

162
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,616
Hey, no offense, but this
plan of yours is awful.

163
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:45,686
Let's call it quits before
I get dismembered, okay?

164
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,689
Hmph. No, wait.

165
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,623
Huh?

166
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,125
Look.

167
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,327
Our enemies are
afraid to attack.

168
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,063
They fear the wrath
of the Nose Storm.

169
00:14:56,096 --> 00:15:01,001
Yeah? You think so? Alright!

170
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,038
That swordsman is more
ruthless than I imagined.

171
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:04,905
How cruel.

172
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:07,308
Turning his own
partner into a weapon.

173
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,077
Nah. He's just desperate.

174
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,612
They're trying to buy time.

175
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:15,583
Zoro, your trusty blade
is prepared at last.

176
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,751
My heart is tempered in steel!

177
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,687
Attack them without reservation.

178
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,057
I shall not falter! To victory!

179
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,792
That's more like it.

180
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:30,263
Mighty Nose Storm
Killer Attack Allure.

181
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,567
Allure? Oh!

182
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,072
That captures the beauty
of Nose Storm perfectly!

183
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,641
I admit, I am quite alluring!

184
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,542
Excellent work, Zoro.

185
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,624
Hm? Is he asking us to
come over there and kill him?

186
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:05,131
Wait, what're you--?

187
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:06,734
Don't mind if I do!

188
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,501
Not if I get there first!

189
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,672
Shave!

190
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,613
Damn it.

191
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,482
I can't believe I fell
for that stupid trick.

192
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:24,218
Now he's just using
his friend as bait!

193
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,387
So when you said
"allure" you meant

194
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,788
the kind that you
catch fish with?

195
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,291
I taste terrible!

196
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,492
What am I to you, huh?

197
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,495
Just bait? Not even
a sword, anymore?

198
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,663
One more time.

199
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,165
Killer Attack A Lure.

200
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,133
Have you no shame?

201
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,069
By the way, I think you've got

202
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,005
this whole "Killer Attack"
thing totally wrong.

203
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,441
The only one dying is me!

204
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,518
I see, so you have zoan-type
devil fruit powers, do you?

205
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:58,385
Are you dense?

206
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,354
I told you, that's not me!

207
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,157
But this isn't some
random monster, is it?

208
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,225
Those are reindeer antlers,

209
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,595
and I'd recognize
that hat anywhere!

210
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,297
But what happened?

211
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,700
Is that giant thing
really Chopper?

212
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,738
Even so, I've never
seen a beast like this!

213
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:23,009
Moon Walk!

214
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,312
Tempest Kick!

215
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,082
Stop it! Leave him alone!

216
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,718
Hey, Chopper!
It's you, isn't it?

217
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:33,687
What's going on?
Did you do this?

218
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,598
Maybe he just doesn't
recognize me now.

219
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,799
I must look strange.

220
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:48,269
You are Chopper, aren't you?

221
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,603
I was kidding, all right?

222
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,273
I didn't think you actually
turned into that thing!

223
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,074
Don't treat me like I'm a fool!

224
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,009
Chopper!

225
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:59,679
She ignored me! So rude!

226
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,550
Chopper! What's wrong with you?

227
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,386
It's me! Nami! Look!

228
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,529
Stop it!

229
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,668
Why are you doing this?

230
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,123
Oh no. Sanji's down there!

231
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,358
I don't know where
that awful thing

232
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,627
wandered in from,
but I'll make it pay.

233
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,462
Don't you lay a finger on him!

234
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,764
I won't let you hurt my friends!

235
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:15,522
What the heck happened to him?

236
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,726
This isn't good.

237
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,061
I need to find a
way to stop him.

238
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,732
That thing is your friend?

239
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:25,699
How amusing!

240
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,335
You pirates keep strange
company, don't you?

241
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,703
Chopper!

242
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,374
She ignored me again!

243
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,041
How rude can you get?

244
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,411
I'd love to have
you take care of

245
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,412
that monster for me,

246
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,282
but I've been given an
order to eliminate you.

247
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:43,617
And time is running short.

248
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:45,652
Tempest Kick!

249
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,155
Uh-oh. I don't think I can dodge

250
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,523
when my legs are
slippery like this!

251
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,362
Huh? I'm still okay?

252
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,532
One of my legs
is back to normal.

253
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,067
But why? Did I miss something?

254
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:03,370
It's wet.

255
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,173
It must've happened when
Chopper threw the bathtub.

256
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,107
Wait!

257
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,108
I get it!

258
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:11,177
All I have to do is wash
the soap off with water!

259
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,193
Let's not be hasty.

260
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:28,829
Even if you can
counter the effects

261
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:31,298
of my Golden Bubbles with
water, that doesn't mean

262
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,267
I'm going to stand by
and let you do it.

263
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:40,674
Sheep Cloud! Relaxing Bubbles!

264
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,242
No problem.

265
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,211
This is nothing a
little wind can't fix!

266
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,215
Now. Cyclone. Damn it!

267
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:55,589
Oh no. My strength is--

268
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,293
Supple Finger Pistol!

269
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,696
My Takt--

270
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,598
Whip!

271
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,248
That was helpful.

272
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,083
Helpful?

273
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:27,254
If you blow me away
with an attack like that,

274
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,556
then those annoying bubbles

275
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,325
of yours get blown away, too.

276
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,593
Aren't you tough!

277
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,594
Well, if you like,

278
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,429
I'll blow you away until
there's nothing left!

279
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,104
The forecast is cloudy!
Cloudy Tempo!

280
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,709
This sure beats
that magic show stuff

281
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,377
this thing used to do.

282
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,115
Clouds? Fighting
with lightning again?

283
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,786
These clouds aren't
for lightning.

284
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,821
They're way too thin for that.

285
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:04,057
This time, I have
something else in mind!

286
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:08,262
I see. Damn. I should've known!

287
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:11,665
The forecast is rain! Cool Ball!

288
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:12,766
Shave!

289
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,771
Pour down! Rain Tempo!

290
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,547
And I worked so hard.

291
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,283
How rude to wash
everything away.

292
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,819
If your idea of "nice"
is getting my ass beat,

293
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,621
then I'll pass.

294
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:35,622
Cool Charge!

295
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,697
Mirage Tempo!

296
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:47,801
She's gone!

297
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,370
I've watched your every move.

298
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,538
I know your strengths.

299
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,508
And I know all your
weaknesses, as well.

300
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,577
What's-- What's happening?

301
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:04,384
Mirage Tempo Fata Morgana.

302
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,726
What? Chopper!

303
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,561
Why the hell doesn't
he recognize us?

304
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,630
I've got no idea,
but that is Chopper!

305
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:19,266
Who else has antlers
and wears a hat like that?

306
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,101
Step aside, you guys!

307
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:21,801
Hey, hold it!

308
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,037
What do you think you're doing?

309
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,772
That deer monster
is on our side!

310
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,540
That's the last straw, Franky!

311
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,108
You're not going
to get away with this!

312
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,044
Nobody treats
my friends that way!

313
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,478
On the next One Piece:

314
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,746
"Nami's Decision!

315
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,014
Fire at the
Out-of-

316
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,217
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
