1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,638
I don't know why
you're doing this.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,175
I told you very clearly
that I wouldn't see you again.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,711
I said I would never
return to the Straw Hats!

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,713
You think they'd
be happy to go on,

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,114
knowing that one
of their friends

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,749
had thrown her
life away for them?

7
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,451
Now that they know why you left,

8
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,254
they'll follow you to the
depths of hell if they have to

9
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,691
and they'll bust every skull
they can on the way there!

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,293
How many times do
I have to tell you this?!

11
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,496
Even if you think you can save
me, I don't want your help!

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,132
Don't you care how I feel?!

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,503
Hey, keep it down in there, you!

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,505
Now Ramen Kenpo!

15
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,007
Noodle Nail Knockout!

16
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,422
Epluchage!

17
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:02,229
Convert!

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:16,810
No way, that's ridiculous!

19
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,282
Franky Centaur Mode!

20
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,483
It's backwards!

21
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:25,085
Your head's supposed to be
in the front, not your crotch!

22
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,359
Two-Sword Style Sword Draw...

23
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,470
...Rashomon!

24
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,015
We're not done yet.

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,318
What the hell is that?!

26
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,653
It's a Sea King!

27
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,157
There's someone
waiting on this railway.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,293
Someone who can
cut Sea Kings in half.

29
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,407
Everyone get back to
the front cars right now!

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,642
This is a trap!

31
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,046
What the?!

32
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,452
How foolish to fall
for the enemy's scheme!

33
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,686
No!

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,622
How shameful!

35
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,490
Have a safe trip, gentlemen!

36
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,459
Say hello to the
Sea Kings for me!

37
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,431
I must catch the train.

38
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,269
I must rectify my mistake
and capture the prisoners

39
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,605
before their evil is once
again set upon this world!

40
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,575
I cannot allow
the blood and tears

41
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:58,178
of innocent
civilians to be shed!

42
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,581
I'll show them that
there's justice yet

43
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,650
in this cruel and
unforgiving world!

44
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:07,588
I don't care if my body
is torn to shreds

45
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,822
by these raging waves.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,790
I swear!

47
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,991
No matter the cost,

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,427
I'll protect the future of
law-abiding citizens everywhere!

49
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,182
Huh?

50
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,666
Huh?

51
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,439
No, it can't be!

52
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:17,143
It seems there's
another sea train!

53
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,416
I see someone.

54
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,187
What the?

55
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,025
Hey, there's a guy out there!

56
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,596
It's the Ship-Slasher!

57
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,666
That's not good!

58
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,833
Ship what?

59
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,036
They call him
"Ship-Slasher" T-Bone.

60
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,337
He's from the Navy.

61
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,139
His sword cuts
through pirate ships

62
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,107
like a knife cuts
through a steak!

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,208
Whoa!

64
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,409
That sounds awesome.

65
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,713
Maybe it'd be awesome if it
was somebody else's problem!

66
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,381
All right men, let's go!

67
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,516
We only get one shot!

68
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:57,418
Set your sights on T-Bone!

69
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,252
You ready?

70
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,054
Yeah!

71
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,495
Hold on!

72
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,330
Huh?

73
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,030
What?!

74
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:11,799
We don't have time to hold on--

75
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,034
he's gonna cut
Rocketman in half!

76
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,170
Jeez, there's
nothing to worry about!

77
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,072
Zoro's got this.

78
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,406
Just watch!

79
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,315
I'm only gonna tell
you this one time!

80
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,517
Get the hell out of the way!

81
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,124
There's no other track.

82
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:40,194
I'm sure they passed
by my men on the way here.

83
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:44,464
What did those
monsters do to them?!

84
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,235
They must be
Nico Robin's crewmates.

85
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,805
In that case, that swordsman
is the pirate hunter!

86
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,676
Those who defile this path
of justice will face my wrath!

87
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,681
I am a proud
Captain of the Navy!

88
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,783
I shall not let you pass!

89
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,153
Be it wood or steel,
I'll slash your ship in two!

90
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,289
Good luck with that one.

91
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,357
We won't stop 'til
we reach our goal.

92
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,160
And I'll cut down
anything in our way!

93
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,664
This guy is fierce.

94
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,303
En garde!

95
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:35,416
I hate crooked swordplay.
Right Angle Flying Bird.

96
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:40,020
Three-Sword Style Bull Demon!

97
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,626
Bone Phoenix!

98
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,812
He cut right through it!

99
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,446
Bold Hooves!

100
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,532
No way!

101
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,813
He beat T-Bone!

102
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,249
He must've come from
one of the loose cars.

103
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,684
Gotta hand it to him.

104
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,420
It takes a lot of guts to
keep going in a storm like this.

105
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,689
But still that's not
enough to stop us.

106
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,061
I'm sure the burden
of justice is a heavy one

107
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,030
but we've got a
few burdens of our own.

108
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,808
Hurry! Hurry!!

109
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,376
Captain T-Bone is out here!

110
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,377
He needs our help!

111
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,147
What if he already got
hit by that sea train?

112
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,249
Hey, don't even joke
about something like that,

113
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,117
you bastard--our
captain would cut

114
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,753
that crappy train in
two and you know it!

115
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,723
But that pirate hunter guy
from the Straw Hats is scary!

116
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,258
Full speed ahead, men!

117
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,160
We owe Captain T-Bone our lives

118
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,762
after he protected us
from that giant Sea King!

119
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,264
We have to save him!

120
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,033
Yeah!

121
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,147
Roronoa Zoro.

122
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,549
How vexing.

123
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,826
You think it was Sanji?

124
00:10:58,859 --> 00:10:59,927
Of course!

125
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,529
How else do you think those
train cars got detached?

126
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,797
Good strategy, huh?

127
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,766
So you think
we'll catch up soon?

128
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,067
Seems like it.

129
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,202
Yeah!

130
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:15,476
I'm ready for a fight!

131
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,411
Go, Rocketman!

132
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,180
We're gonna beat up
that pigeon guy!

133
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,192
That was close.

134
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,129
I can't believe our
plan actually worked.

135
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,311
No it's not just my imagination.

136
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,225
That's right!

137
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,459
I know this smell!

138
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:43,330
This is the stench of filthy
pirates if I ever smelled it!

139
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,799
Something's
definitely wrong here.

140
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,103
Yeeek!

141
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,409
Is something wrong?

142
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,486
What?!

143
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,087
He's coming back?!

144
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,022
Why?!

145
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,211
You... You cut me!

146
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,786
Huh? You didn't cut me?

147
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,488
Sure peeling onions
may not be glamorous,

148
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,225
but you have to put love into
every aspect of your cooking.

149
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,529
Kitchen knives aren't
for cutting people.

150
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,664
You don't treat
them like swords.

151
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,834
However, they did a fine job
of cutting down that armor.

152
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,669
Kitchen Knife Throw!

153
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,806
Punk!

154
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,007
Oeil!

155
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:05,346
My eyes! They're caving in!

156
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,480
Let 'em.

157
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,382
Now, shut your
mouth and give up.

158
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,020
Yeah, you wish!

159
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:15,689
I don't get it.

160
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,157
Why do you want to
save that terrible woman

161
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,126
so much in the first place?!

162
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,229
Or maybe Nico Robin's
got you all fooled.

163
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,431
You want me to tell
you the truth, huh?

164
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,433
Think you can take it?

165
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,301
Nez!

166
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,168
Joue!

167
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,203
Bouche!

168
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,537
Dents!

169
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,439
Menton!!

170
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,510
If you keep talking like that,

171
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,012
I'm gonna re-arrange your face.

172
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,715
Hold on a sec.

173
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,651
Anything but the face!

174
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:45,385
Cut it out!

175
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,190
Everyone knows she's bad news.

176
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,592
It's no secret!

177
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,426
She's evil!

178
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,193
A monster!

179
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,728
Better off dead!

180
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,499
Parage Shot!

181
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,252
Damn it, I think
my face caved in!

182
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,186
I need a mirror.

183
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,736
How could you?!

184
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,837
You fiend!

185
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,640
You ruined my beautiful eyes
and my fabulous teeth!

186
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,680
Too bad!

187
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:50,050
You're the devil, aren't you?!

188
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,053
Hey, your face went back!

189
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,722
You're right!

190
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,389
Look!

191
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,525
My inner beauty is shining!

192
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,762
It was but a fleeting illusion.

193
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,664
You're guilty of three sins.

194
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,432
Let me list them.

195
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:10,471
First off, you dared to call
yourself a chef in front of me.

196
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:14,241
Second, you were
disrespectful to your food.

197
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:18,178
And third, you
insulted my friend.

198
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,280
For that, you'll pay.

199
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,690
Hiss!

200
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,026
You put on a big show, but
you're all bark and no bite!

201
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,497
Whether you've got
two legs or four,

202
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,367
you still seem pretty
useless to me, centaur.

203
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,644
Ah! No!

204
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,385
Lookin' pretty pathetic, buddy.

205
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,387
Shut up!

206
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,623
Shall I give you a hand?

207
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,362
No, no, no!

208
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,630
Don't you dare!

209
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,303
Just kidding!

210
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,122
Give me a hand?

211
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,590
You oughta be
ashamed of yourself,

212
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,159
using a line like that!

213
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,196
And what was that about
four legs being useless?

214
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,164
I just needed to catch you!

215
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:46,500
You can't run now!

216
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,569
I hate you, you jerk!

217
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,338
I just want to be me!!

218
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,407
Give me my individuality back!

219
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:00,447
Right on the other side
of that door behind you,

220
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,050
my friend is waiting
to be rescued.

221
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,318
In other words,
get out of the way.

222
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,327
When I say no, I mean no!

223
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,731
Ramen Kenpo Secret
Move Poison Pasta Cutter!

224
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,500
Touch it and die!

225
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,602
Go, go, go, go, go!

226
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,170
You people are pathetic!

227
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,106
Nico Robin has you eating
right out of her hand!

228
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,208
She's betrayed every
person she's ever met,

229
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,311
and you're here risking
your life to save her?

230
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,712
You're beyond help!

231
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,247
It's time to die!

232
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,021
Three-Spot Decoupage.

233
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,161
Hiss! I didn't think
you'd use such a dumb trick!

234
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,665
I let my guard down!

235
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,065
Right!

236
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,169
Oh, yeah, cause I'm
the dumb one here.

237
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:10,110
Instead of making excuses
why don't you tell me

238
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:14,180
what you want written on
your gravestone, brother.

239
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,117
Oh, I get it.

240
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,820
You don't think this
fight is over yet, do you?

241
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,488
What?

242
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,824
Since you dodged all
my punches so far,

243
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,259
I can't really blame you.

244
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,164
You have no clue
how hard I can hit.

245
00:20:30,197 --> 00:20:32,699
It's gonna be a nasty surprise!

246
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:42,042
Here's my Ultimate Hammer!

247
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,623
Wow, some entrance.

248
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,258
What the hell have
you been doing?

249
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,492
Ow!

250
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:35,429
Well as per usual, I've been
kicking ass and what about you?

251
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,631
Been kicking ass.

252
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:49,143
So it's you, huh?

253
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:52,279
You're the bastards
who kidnapped Robin.

254
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,430
Robin, my sweet,
how I've missed you!

255
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,332
Let's go back together, okay?

256
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:19,667
Forgive me for intruding Sanji,

257
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,102
but I think the lady
objects to your plan.

258
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,671
Robin, why?!

259
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,606
Worry not, I know
just what to do!

260
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,142
Believe in my strength, friend!

261
00:23:28,175 --> 00:23:31,545
On the next One Piece:
"Scramble over Robin!

262
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,714
A Cunning Plan by Sniper King!!"

263
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,449
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
