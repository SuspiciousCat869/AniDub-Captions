172
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,267
Calling yourself a genius
doesn't make you one.

173
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,603
Self‐important jackass would
be a more accurate title.

174
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,505
Tell me, Mr. Henzo.

175
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,440
It's Professor Henzo, Miss.

176
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,441
Hey!

177
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,211
[ROBIN] Professor Henzo,
do you know this book?

178
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,179
Is that‐‐?!

179
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,448
I came across it in Alabasta.

180
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,450
So that's it.
I thought Rainbow Mist

181
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,552
sounded kinda familiar,
and it turns out I was right.

182
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,455
It's the title of the book
Robin's been reading.

183
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,624
I can't figure out
who authored the book,

184
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,360
but it was written
well over 40 years ago.

185
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,529
According to the book,
the Rainbow Mist

186
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,531
could possibly be
the Garden of the Gods,

187
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,734
or even El Dorado,
the fabled City of Gold.

188
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,302
What do you think, Professor?

189
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,538
The latter is nothing
more than a legend.

190
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,140
Many adventurers have
fallen prey to its lure

191
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,143
and the potential for finding
untold riches inside it.

192
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,446
Countless people have sailed off
in search of the Rainbow Mist,

193
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,549
never to be seen again.

194
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,218
Including some
dear friends of mine.

195
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,094
Oh. So that's why you're
researching the mist.

196
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,229
[MASTER]
Hey, friend.

197
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,096
[USOPP]
Huh?

198
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,565
I would take whatever
that guy says

199
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,733
with a grain of salt
if I were you.

200
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,901
[USOPP]
Yeah, and why's that?

201
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,238
Because he's one of Mayor
Whetton's dogs, that's why.

202
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,472
A dog?

203
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,075
Yeah! He receives all of his
research funding from the mayor

204
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,410
and lives the easy life!

205
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,779
He's nothing but
a sham of a scientist!

212
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,274
Well, well, good citizens!
Hello, there!

213
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,842
I certainly hope that
all of you are having

214
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,777
an enjoyable meal today!

215
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,482
Knocking back a
nice cold one, are you?

216
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,618
Of course, you do realize
if you drink liquor

217
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,287
that you'll have to pay the
liquor‐drinking tax, right?

218
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,324
Hey! Wait a minute! Please!

219
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,792
If you take what's in
my wallet, I won't have

220
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,228
anything to support
my family with!

221
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,696
[FLIP]
Who cares?

222
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,700
It's a citizen's duty to pay
any taxes that are required.

223
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,535
And those who
neglect this civic duty

224
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,205
have no right to live in
our humble little village.

225
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,141
Who's that jerk face?

226
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,510
[MASTER]
Mayor Whetton's son, Flip.

227
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,480
A total bastard who always
extorts tax money from us

228
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,181
for the slightest things.

229
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,182
[FLIP]
Hm?

230
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,687
Ho ho! Well, well, if it
isn't Professor Henzo!

231
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,689
Father was actually
looking for you.

232
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,659
He was wondering how
your mist research was going.

233
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
Same as always: inconclusive.

234
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,763
There's no telling when
or where the Rainbow Mist

235
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,865
is going to appear, after all.

236
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,500
My, my.

237
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,735
That's a shame, since
your research is supported

238
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,837
by citizens' tax Berries.

239
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,507
And what expensive
research it is, too.

240
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,376
That Rainbow Tower of yours
cost a fortune to build.

241
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,378
Don't forget that the
slower your research goes,

242
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,846
the more taxes
we have to collect

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,683
and the more it puts
everyone here out.

244
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,284
I'll see you later.

245
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,428
Well, well, well. You there.

246
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,930
Eating a heaping plate
of spaghetti, are you?

247
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,199
[LUFFY]
It's my second. I was hungry.

248
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,936
You realize that eating
a heaping plate of food

249
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,206
means you're going to have
to pay a heaping tax, right?

250
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,408
My friend here's paying today.

251
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,876
Stop saying that!

252
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,452

‐‐Damn it. I'm broke.

‐‐[LUFFY] Thanks.
‐‐Cram it, you jerk!

255
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,962
So I hope you understand now.

256
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,564
If you don't want
the people around here

257
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,933
to think ill of you,
there's a simple solution.

258
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,736
Don't hang around Henzo.

259
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,571
[ROBIN]
Thanks for the warning.

260
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,341
It's appreciated, but it's
really not up to me to decide.

261
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
It's up to him.

Well of course, Chopper!

264
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,437
I still need some blank charts.

265
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,105
If we run out of them
while we're at sea,

266

we'll be in big trouble.

A galleon?

344
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,830
It couldn't be!

00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,066
That's the spirit, Pops!
Let's go check it out!

Oh, wow! It's huge!

351
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,987
It appears to be an older ship.

352
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,055
[HENZO]
It's the Talielisin.

353
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,523

Whoa! That thing is so awesome!

It's incredible!

It's cool, it's slick. I think I
gotta have one of those things.

Hey, watch the bags!

365
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,707
[SANJI] I pretty much
dodged that last one.

366
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,876
I barely felt anything.

Oh, really?

Those were expensive! And you
know what I'm gonna do to you

372

Jeez, give him a break, Nami.

374

He just got shot with

Any normal person
would already be dead!

carry them yourself?

Are any of you here?

Hey, Pops!

What the hell?!

00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,524
Hello, can I have your
way‐cool little boat?

399
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,127
You must have eaten
a Devil Fruit, didn't you?

400
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,228
Sure did.

401
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,164
It was a Gum‐Gum Fruit,
and it made me a rubber man.

402
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,401
[HENZO]
My machine is called the H‐1,

403
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,403
and I'm sorry, but I
can't let you have it.

[LUFFY]
Aw, come on, please?

405
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,406
I'll give it a good home!

406
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,280
It appears that there
were people here

407
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,915
just a little while ago.

408
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,284
But we checked the entire
ship and didn't find anyone

on board.

410
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,024
There were people aboard once,
but that was 50 years ago

411
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,959
when this ship went adrift.

412
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,794
Wait, 50 years ago?

413
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,430
This ship's in pretty good
condition to be that old.

414
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,034
[HENZO]
That it is.

415
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,770
Just as it was when
I was last aboard.

416
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,005

but I've never gotten a reading

That's the Rainbow Mist!

to take into the open sea!

428
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,501
That could work.

Yeah, if you wanna go so bad,

432
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,744
you should take that galleon!

433
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,980
Trust me, I would,
but the Talielisin's helm

434
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,315
is still broken.

435
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,750
It was destroyed
long ago by Wetton.

436
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,919
This is getting
weirder by the minute.

00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,522
How do you what happened
to that ship, Pops?

438
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,656

Because 50 years ago,

439
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,427

What happened?

443
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,905
Those guys from earlier
must have taken it and Zoro

444
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,540
since we didn't pay their taxes!

Oh, this is just great!

really going in there?

Isn't that the place
where countless people

have sailed off into,
never to be seen again?

451
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,958
Indeed, but I've spent
decades trying to locate

452
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,961

damned if I turn back now.
