WEBVTT

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.738
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.707
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:10.477
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.046
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.253
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.188
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.259
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.625
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:41.528
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.799
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:52.539
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.474
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.843
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.512
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:04.184
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.852
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.722
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.860
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.697
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.832
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.034
Scattered across the world,

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.002
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.704
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.040
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:29.375
and move forward to next
stage of their journey:

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.344
The New World.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.380
Let nothing stop you
from reaching the top!

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.184
Listen up, guys!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.853
There's a lot I wanna say,
but we don't have much time.

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.622
One thing can't wait, though.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.592
What you went through these past
two years was selfish of me,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.660
so thanks for
puttin' up with it.

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.498
Let's go!

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:03.476
[LUFFY] "A Surprising Fact!
The Man Who Guarded the Sunny!"

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.381
Brother, it's too
hard to dig here!

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:13.319
Of course it is. This island
is all rocks and tree roots.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:16.089
[FAKE ZORO] No! Don't bury us!
We're victims, too!

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.791
Please, I'll do anything
you want, just let me live!

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.094
Captain Luffy--no,
I mean Black.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.428
He made us do this!

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.930
[laughs]

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:27.300
Listen, I have a secret
to share with you.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.935
We didn't give a
damn about going

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:31.771
to the New World with
the Straw Hats.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:38.911
The reason we joined... was so
we could stab them in the back

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.246
and collect their bounties

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.016
without them ever
suspecting a thing.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:44.851
[FAKE STRAW HATS gasp]

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:47.253
[FAKE ZORO]
No! Drip! Stop it!

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.988
I don't know what
that goopy stuff is,

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.090
but you're gonna kill him
if you keep that up!

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.426
I won't let my friend die!

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.129
Got him! Take that, bastard!

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.163
Huh?

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.769
Huh? Uh-oh. That's weird!

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.104
[ALL Scream]

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.041
[CARIBOU] And sure, your Straw
Hat did look a little off,

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:11.944
but it had been two years,
so I didn't think much of it.

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.481
You lied without remorse,
and deception is a sin.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.784
One that you will be buried for.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.054
Brother, how goes the grave?

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.522
[CORIBOU]
I'm digging! I'm digging!

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:25.892
Sinners all. These poor fools.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:30.163
Gods in heaven...
please, forgive them.

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:31.898
Grant them peace in death.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.032
[ALL scream]

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:36.135
Nuh-uh! Peace, yes,
but not death!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.839
Still, it's not all
bad, I suppose.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.141
I did find the real Luffy.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.377
[laughs]

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.211
[SENTOMARU]
I told you,

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.813
there wasn't any choice
in the matter.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.815
What did you expect?

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.218
Dark King Rayleigh was there.
He's as strong as Kizaru.

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.519
Even with the Pacifistas,

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:56.022
we couldn't so much
as slow him down.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.324
Unfortunately, the
Caribou brothers escaped

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.193
along with the rest
of their crew.

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.362
It seems they took some
of the fake Straw Hats

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:05.164
with them as well,
though I can't imagine why.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.533
At any rate, we captured
most of the pirates,

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.569
even though the real Straw
Hats heavily damaged

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:11.404
two of our Pacifistas.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:15.241
One of the units was the same
prototype they fought before.

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:18.177
Its strength hasn't changed
in the last two years.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.681
That's bad news. For us.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.383
I don't know what
they've been up to,

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.084
but the Straw Hats
are immeasurably

00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:27.353
more dangerous than before.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.021
Tell the Marines
in the New World

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.858
that they have a new
threat coming their way.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.626
The Straw Hats have returned,

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.295
and they're stronger than
we could've imagined.

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:50.576
[SHAKKY] A pity they had
to take off so soon.

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:56.616
But I'm proud of them.

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:00.286
They're tough.
They're gonna do just fine.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.387
You were watching?

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.623
Yes. I'm a big fan.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:08.928
[SHAKKY]
I know that smile, Ray.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.596
What's on your mind?

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.731
Huh?

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.666
Ah.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.501
It's nothing, really.

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.242
[GOLD ROGER]
Uh? Whoa-ho!

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.310
[RAYLEIGH]
Huh?

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:25.745
[GOLD ROGER] Hey, that's
a nice ship you got there!

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.613
[RAYLEIGH] Thanks, but
it's not exactly mine.

00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.116
Or rather, I stole it after
my house burned down.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.485
[GOLD ROGER] Oh, yeah?
And what's your name?

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.754
[RAYLEIGH]
Rayleigh.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.155
My name's Roger.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.592
It's destiny meeting you, I say.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.127
[RAYLEIGH]
Oh, yeah?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.430
How 'bout we team up and turn
this whole world upside down?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:47.934
Huh? And I thought
I drank too much.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:48.901
Ha-ah!

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.603
I dunno who you are
or what you're selling,

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.938
but I'm not interested.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.940
[GOLD ROGER] Come on, you got
a good thing goin' here.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.275
Your ship might be small,
but if we handle it right,

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.344
I bet it could even
survive a storm!

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.513
We could conquer the
seas in this thing!

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.881
Let's set sail!

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:03.216
[RAYLEIGH]
What do you mean "we"?

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.318
I just met you
half a minute ago.

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.453
Why don't you get your
own damned boat?

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.421
[GOLD ROGER]
One of these days,

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.156
you're gonna look back
at this and realize

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:13.226
it was the beginning of the
greatest adventure ever known!

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.862
[GOLD ROGER laughs]

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.868
Before then, I never
believed much in fate.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:26.239
But maybe nothing really
happens by accident.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:29.342
We're just too blind
to see all the signs.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.845
Anyway, that hat found
the right man.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.548
So long as it sails,
I'll stay here.

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:36.983
Waiting.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:40.186
Because I want to see
a new king before I die.

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:46.025
[ROBIN] The surface is
already so far away.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:47.159
What a view!

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.062
I've been under before,
but portholes on a submarine?

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.964
They got nothin' on this!

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:54.433
[CHOPPER]
We're sinking! Sinking!

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.537
What if we get a leak?
This is freaking me out!

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.738
Yeah, it feels like
we're leaving

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.273
the whole world behind.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.240
It's eerie.

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:02.441
No big deal.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:07.046
I've done this like a bajillion
times before. It's cool.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.715
Nope. Not pooping my
pants at all, here.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:11.584
[gasps]

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:14.520
[LUFFY]
The ocean sure is awesome.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.295
[laughs]

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.597
Look at that! They really
are trees, huh?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.900
[LUFFY, NAMI chuckle]

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:30.536
[LUFFY] Wow, I totally
forgot about that!

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:34.140
They're giant mangroves.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:35.908
You can't tell when
you're up top.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:38.611
but it's sure quite a sight
to see from down here.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.581
[BROOK] The majesty of
nature is truly humbling!

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.749
Why, my eyes would be
popping out of my skull

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.651
if I had any eyes
to speak of, I mean!

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.119
[BROOK laughs]

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.921
Who cares? I've seen this.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.790
'Cause you got on
the wrong ship!

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.993
Shut up! Don't ruin this for us!

00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:56.429
These roots, they're beautiful.

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.197
And think about it.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.634
They stretch all the way down
to the bottom of the sea.

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:09.141
[chuckles] Okay, you win.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.309
[USOPP]
Hey, Chopper.

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.511
I think there's something
behind that tree.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.347
Huh?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.283
Whoa! It's huge!

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.952
Took us long enough to
get here, but whatever.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.220
It was worth the wait.

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.788
I wonder what comes next...

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.057
Oh, fishies!

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.526
I bet I can grab 'em!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.795
I see. These look
pretty good, too.

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:30.630
Here goes.

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.198
[CHOPPER yelping]

00:10:32.231 --> 00:10:34.066
That's not funny!

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.702
If you pop that bubble
and we all die,

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:39.071
I'm gonna kill you! Twice!

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.307
[SANJI] Nami, you know how
the coating works, right?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.541
Can we get some basic tips

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:44.677
before another idiot
flips out on us?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.379
Good point. Okay.

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:49.048
Rayleigh gave me a manual,
but I can summarize it.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.183
So listen closely, okay?

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:54.220
She's real! I can die happy!

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.088
[ALL]
Sanji!

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:58.024
[CHOPPER] You don't have
to take us with you!

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.459
[USOPP]
Who's flippin' out now, idiot?!

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.329
[LUFFY, USOPP, CHOPPER]
What?!

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.364
His nosebleed shot him out!

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:08.167
I see. It maintains
its shape well.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.669
You'd think that it would burst.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:12.171
Especially considering the
immense amount of water pressure

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:14.407
the coating must be exposed to.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.341
How nice.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.176
And I thought we'd
all drown down here,

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.345
never to be seen again.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:23.282
Sanji! Get outta the ocean!

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:27.019
Right. Sea water. Damn it!

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.888
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Keep pulling!

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.599
[grunts]

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.369
Sanji! What the heck happened
to you back there?

00:11:43.402 --> 00:11:44.970
I knew you were weak
to pretty girls,

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:46.872
but this is a real liability!

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.607
You're supposed to be cool!

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.276
[BROOK]
That poor man.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.712
I can only imagine the horrors
he must have endured

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.413
during the past two years.

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.549
Let's hope he lives long enough
to see the mermaids

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:59.051
he was so looking forward to.

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:02.288
Ah, and let's also hope
they aren't quite so lovely

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.423
that the sight of them
strikes him dead.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:07.927
When we get there, we'll have
to ask for blood donations.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.562
But they won't be human.

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:12.231
I hope Fishmen have the
same kind of blood as him.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:15.134
So Sunny's coating has
the same properties

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.669
as the bubbles on Sabaody.

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:19.405
Meaning that objects or
people can pass in and out,

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.273
without causing it
any harm at all.

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.477
Spare me the bubble-science!
We got a man down here!

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.746
[NAMI]
Sanji aside, she's not wrong.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.181
We saw this all over Sabaody.

00:12:29.215 --> 00:12:30.616
It only stretches so far,

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:32.818
then allows an object
to pass through.

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.687
So the good news is,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.089
if we get attacked by any
nasty sea creatures,

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.024
we can still fire
cannons at them,

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.926
just like we would if
we were above water.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.994
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:45.664
Wait, so what would pop it?
Is it that durable?

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.333
It does fine with
single objects,

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.168
but if too many things
pass through at once,

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:50.035
then it'll break.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:51.237
Let's see.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.039
Like, if a Sea King clamps down
on the ship, for example.

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:55.341
That's bad.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:58.043
[BOTH scream]

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:01.614
[BOTH]
Ah! We're so screwed!

00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:03.783
We're safe. Good riddance.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.818
[NAMI] Also, the coating
doesn't protect the ship

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:07.153
from anything except water,

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:09.155
so if we crash into
a rock or a trench,

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:11.123
and the mast breaks,
or something like that,

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.658
then the bubble
could also burst.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.127
So it's not like we can just
bounce around down here.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.463
Still, as long as we take
the usual precautions,

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.631
we should be fine.

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:20.666
I mean, I'm sure Luffy will
try to get us all killed,

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.835
but what else is new?

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:25.037
So we're in the clear
after all. Good!

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.071
[USOPP laughs]

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:29.208
Well, in theory at least,
but a lot of ships

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:31.210
try to make the trip
to Fishman Island.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:33.979
And over 70% of them sink.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:37.483
[BOTH]
Ah! We are so dead!

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.251
[LUFFY]
One Gum-Gum Gatling

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:42.321
and I bet I can catch all
the fish swimmin' out there.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.323
[ZORO] Yeah? If I cut enough
holes in this bubble thing,

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:47.059
I bet I can catch even more.

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:50.196
Weren't you listening to Nami?!
That's too many holes!

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:52.698
Our chances down here
are bad enough as it is!

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:54.433
I'll break your bones,
then fix them,

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.668
then break them again!

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:56.702
No fair!

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:58.704
Hachi said he'd show
us to Fishman Island

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.005
like it was no big deal,

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.674
and now we're stuck
in this death bubble,

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.709
slowly descending to our demise!

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:04.710
Oh, yeah!

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.713
Lunch time! They packed
a bunch of food for me!

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:10.883
Since Sanji's sick, we should
have ourselves a picnic!

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.452
Yay! All that screaming
made me hungry!

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.687
[laughs]

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.522
And I'm wasting away!

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.623
Cool.

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:20.626
As long as Nami thinks
the ship'll stay stable.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:23.362
We don't have to steer it
or anything right now, do we?

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.296
[NAMI]
Nope.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.698
We'll just be cruising
on the sea current

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.700
till we get further down.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.767
So, yeah.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.270
I'm sure we'll have more
excitement a bit later,

00:14:31.303 --> 00:14:32.338
but for the time being,

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.306
we might as well just kick
back and take it easy.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.576
[FRANKY] Well, I would call
this "taking it easy" exactly,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.212
but there's something you
guys should probably know

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:44.550
before we reach Fishman Island.

00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:11.243
[FRANKY]
Now, this is a little heavy,

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:14.146
so I hope it doesn't ruin
lunch for everybody.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.329
I think I know. I'm ready.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:34.233
[ALL]
It's robot stuff, right?!

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.735
You've got all kinds
of secrets, don't you?!

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.570
Can you transform into a tank?

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.173
Or wait, maybe...
you've got laser guns?

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.008
[CHOPPER]
Tell us, robo-bro!

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:46.779
[FRANKY]
Super armored... me.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.084
[LUFFY, CHOPPER, USOPP scream]

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.420
Sorry, no new secrets.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.522
Secrets inaccessible-robo.

00:15:56.555 --> 00:16:00.759
[ALL]
He... speaks... robot!

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:04.530
Okay, I know robots are
cool, but listen up.

00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:06.899
Or eat and listen if you like.

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.871
Like Usopp said, Hachi was
supposed to show us the way

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.807
to Fishman Island, himself,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.476
but he got hurt real bad
back on Sabaody.

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:20.612
He came down here ahead of us
to get medical treatment.

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:24.650
Anyway, it was the same thing
that happened to Duval.

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.785
Meaning, he was
protecting the Sunny

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:29.154
from anyone who came for it.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:30.789
Things got ugly about a year ago

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.292
when the Navy found out
the ship was docked there.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:36.895
Both him and Duval got
taken out in a big fight.

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:39.531
Huh? Wait, a year?

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:42.067
Then who was protecting
the Sunny after that?

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.970
[FRANKY]
We had one more secret ally.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:47.373
If not Rayleigh, then who?

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.708
[FRANKY] Someone who
separated us two years ago,

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.477
for better or worse.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.478
The Warlord.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.712
[ALL]
Huh?

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.648
[FRANKY]
Turns out Bartholomew Kuma

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.218
was on our side the whole time.

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.920
A few days back, when
I made it to the Sunny,

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.655
I couldn't believe my eyes.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:05.724
He was right there.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.731
[KUMA]
I've been waiting for you.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.035
What the hell're
you doing here?

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:19.471
Mission accomplished.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.456
[FRANKY]
You saw for yourself,

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:40.225
there wasn't a single
scratch on the Sunny.

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:43.195
Later, Rayleigh gave
me the whole story.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:46.131
I am a member of the
Revolutionary Army.

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.366
If it's within my power,

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.902
I want to help the Straw
Hats escape from here.

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:52.104
[FRANKY] You guys probably
knew that something was up,

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.806
but now we know the truth.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.909
He saved the Sunny,
and he saved our lives.

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.710
[gasps]

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:02.314
And then, after we were sent
flying from the island,

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:05.717
Kuma paid Rayleigh a visit
and dropped another bombshell.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.387
I don't have much time.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.255
Not as myself.

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:13.392
[FRANKY] The details
are a little sketchy,

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:17.096
but evidently, Kuma surrendered
his body to the Navy.

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:18.630
They used him as an experiment

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:21.400
and replaced his body
parts one by one.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.235
By the time the War of
the Best rolled around,

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:26.071
his personality had
been completely erased.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.574
Wait, he knew where he sent us,

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:31.009
but he didn't know what
we'd do once we got there!

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:33.078
Or that we would
even make it back!

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.481
And you said his personality
was taken away,

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.082
but he still
protected the Sunny?

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:40.586
The guy who worked on him
is this dude named Dr. Vegapunk,

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:42.855
and Kuma must've
made a deal with him,

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:45.691
'cause he programmed one
final mission into his brain.

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:48.760
"Defend the Thousand Sunny
from any attackers

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:52.264
until the moment that a Straw
Hat returns to claim it."

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.633
So even though he's been
reduced to a living weapon

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:58.437
with no memory, he's been
carrying out his own orders.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.206
Protecting our ship for
the past two years

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.342
to fulfill his last wish.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.944
But why? He barely knew us.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:07.846
I mean, why'd it matter to him?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.349
I dunno. Maybe it's
'cause of Luffy.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:12.784
You said Kuma was part
of the Revolutionary Army

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:16.622
and Luffy's dad's the leader
of those guys, right?

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:18.223
[LUFFY]
I don't know much about my dad,

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:21.126
but it seems like that robot
bear dude was a good guy,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.662
so he can't be too bad
if they're friends.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:24.897
[ROBIN]
Kuma.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.632
The bottom line is,

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.034
our survival and all the
things we accomplished

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:31.470
in the past two years,
we owe to him.

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:34.540
Whatever his reason was,
we should be grateful.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.308
And we may never
find out the truth

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:39.711
because it's not like we can ask
him to explain himself anymore.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.748
All we can do now
is honor his memory,

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:46.084
and know that Bartholomew
Kuma was our greatest ally

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.887
until he took his last
breath as a human.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.089
Unfortunately, we'll never
be able to thank him

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:53.825
since he'll just be a weapon,
and likely our enemy

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:56.094
the next time we meet.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.663
That's all I wanted to say.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.998
Kind of a lot to work through
all at once, isn't it?

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.368
Someday, I hope we can at least
find out the rest of the story.

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.337
Kuma saved us, huh?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.206
[CHOPPER]
Oh, you're awake. Good.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.008
[LUFFY] Have some lunch!
It's from Amazon Lily!

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.911
[SANJI] Oh, Amazon Lily.
The island with all the women.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.580
Of course that's
where he sent you.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.682
Do you know where I was
these past two years?

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:18.050
Because I'm kinda
thinking Kuma's

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.851
not such a good
friend after all.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.220
In fact, if he were
here right now,

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.754
I'd like to kick
his metal face in!

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:23.855
[BROOK]
Now, now Sanji,

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.524
we've all had our
share of troubles.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.526
Before I became a
pop music sensation,

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:28.927
I was trapped in a cage.

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.596
Still, the only thing
that matters now

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:31.863
is the voyage awaiting us!

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.633
[SANJI] You don't know, man!
You don't know anything!

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:37.736
Straight ahead!
Brother, look! It's them!

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:40.739
I know! Like you said,
they're straight ahead.

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.140
You think I'm blind?

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.375
[CARIBOU laughs]

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:46.545
Looks like we'll be sailing
with the Straw Hats after all.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:48.981
Wow. How far down are we?

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:53.252
I dunno, but it's getting
darker and darker.

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:54.886
We passed the photic zone,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.090
and it looks like we're around
the bottom of the aphotic zone.

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:01.326
'Bout a thousand meters,
give or take.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.731
It's quiet. And the Sunny
itself feels oddly still.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.734
It's almost like
floating in the sky.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:09.668
The sky.

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.837
I learned so much about
weather up there,

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.139
but I don't know if it's
much use underwater.

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.008
Hey, look, it's a whale!

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.743
[BROOK]
It's just like Laboon!

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.612
[LUFFY] Nah. It looks
more like Whitebeard.

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.987
[USOPP] I can't think
about whales right now.

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.589
I can't think about
anything except the fact

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:31.790
that I'm going to die!

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.925
Or at least 70% going to die.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.594
Why did they tell me that?

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:36.762
Maybe if I keep a lookout,

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.964
I can raise our chances
of making it out of this.

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.532
Better than just sitting here.

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.934
I don't see any big,
scary Sea Kings,

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.003
or stuff the ship
could crash into.

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:47.139
So I guess we're good for now.

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.876
Wait a sec. What is that thing?

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.844
A fish? No.

00:21:52.878 --> 00:21:56.048
[CARIBOU] Are you ready?
We only get one shot at this!

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.549
[CORIBOU]
Ready, brother!

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:58.784
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Ready, Captain.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.185
[CARIBOU]
Before you say anything,

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:01.620
I know what you're thinking:

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:04.022
"Just shoot them
and they'll all drown."

00:22:04.056 --> 00:22:05.991
"They're wanted dead
or alive after all,

00:22:06.024 --> 00:22:08.160
so why not let them die?"

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.895
Well, that wouldn't do at all,

00:22:09.928 --> 00:22:12.898
because the Navy wouldn't
know who killed them.

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:14.900
We have to deliver
their heads personally,

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.335
on a silver platter!

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.203
Then they will fear us!

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.806
The whole world will
know our strength!

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.174
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:24.676
We'll take them out before
they suspect a thing.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.046
My big, smiling face is
the last thing they'll see

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.348
before they die!

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:30.649
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yes, sir!

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.684
[CORIBOU]
Uh, right! Yeah!

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.686
Hey, you guys?

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.022
There's a ship-looking
thing coming our way.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:37.589
[ZORO, SANJI]
What?

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:38.457
[LUFFY]
You sure?

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.225
Why don't you come
look for yourself?

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:42.160
[CARIBOU]
Charge!

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.530
[roars]

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:51.103
[CHOPPER]
It's a pirate ship!

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:53.105
[USOPP] They're ramming
straight into us!

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:56.742
Go away, you morons!
You're gonna make us all drown!

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:04.349
[NAMI] They're not trying
to break our ship,

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.451
they're trying to board it!

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:08.420
Damn it! Who are they?

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:15.293
[NARRATOR]
The Sunny continues descending

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:16.428
towards Fishman Island,

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.398
now with the decidedly
unwelcome Caribou onboard.

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.533
With their bubble threatening
to pop at every turn,

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.268
the crew braves an
undersea waterfall

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:26.304
only to stumble into the den
of the legendary monster,

00:23:26.338 --> 00:23:27.272
the kraken.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.274
With no way to battle
such a massive foe,

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:31.810
a watery grave seems
all but inevitable.

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.311
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:37.449
"Deadly Combat Under the Sea!
The Demon of the Ocean Strikes!"

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:39.918
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
