WEBVTT

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.971
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.008
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.777
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.013
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.251
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:20.520
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.489
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.693
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.958
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.895
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:47.167
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.269
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.637
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.939
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.774
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.210
this has proven to be
the end of the road,

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.913
a graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.584
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.219
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.889
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:14.093
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.335
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.104
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:29.175
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.511
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:36.783
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.718
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.286
get pulled into the conflict

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.656
and find themselves in
the midst of an all-our war!

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.761
If you want to take my life,
then I am powerless to stop you!

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.930
But no one else
should have to suffer!

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.266
I won't let you
harm this kingdom!

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.435
I will protect it with my life!

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.839
So come get me, you monster!

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.428
Dammit, Weepyhoshi!

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.964
I told you to stay where
I could protect you!

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.978
[laughs] I'll show you
what happens to traitors,

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.380
Vander Decken!

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:43.483
But I do admit,
I like this idea of yours!

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.552
[laughs]

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.793
I can't believe I'm
letting you save the girl!

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:57.497
You better not let us down!
Don't hold anything back, Luffy!

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.135
Here I go!

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:08.374
[LUFFY] "Hurry up, Luffy!
Shirahoshi's Life in Jeopardy!"

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.018
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.602
Wha-What's it doing?

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:43.576
[FISHMAN A]
It's leaving!

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:46.813
Look! The Noah's not headed
toward the island anymore!

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.382
[FISHMAN AA] The princess
is leading it away from us!

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.584
It won't crash
into us after all!

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.753
Don't let it hit you!

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.121
[FISHMAN C]
Swim faster!

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.457
[DECKEN laughs]

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.160
[DECKEN]
Where do you think you're going?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.629
You know you can't
run away, don't you?

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:07.633
There is no escape!

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.635
[SHIRAHOSHI panting]

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:13.973
If I'm going
to steer the Noah clear

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.308
of the bubble,
then I have to swim

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.510
as far out to sea as I can!

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.319
[SHIRAHOSHI]
The bubble will surely break

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:28.287
if it takes any more damage!

00:06:29.722 --> 00:06:32.291
[SHIRAHOSHI] But the main
entrance is too far away!

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:35.862
No, wait.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.864
I believe Luffy and his
friends were the last ones

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.000
to leave the Ryugu Palace.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.301
If that's the case,

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.570
perhaps the gateway
is still open!

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.341
[SHIRAHOSHI panting]

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.411
Oh, no.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:54.380
Isn't there some way to help
instead of just standing here?

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.848
What does
Vander Decken have to gain

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:56.883
from this, anyway?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.085
Leave our princess
alone, you monster!

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.486
It's not Shirahoshi's fault--

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.955
she doesn't deserve
to die for this!

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.057
[FISHMAN BB] Hordy's
climbing onto the ship, too?

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.428
That can't be good!
What if he attacks her again?

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.729
[FISHMAN CC]
There's no one to protect her!

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.597
She can't fight him!

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.366
Decken, you filthy traitor.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.535
Have you lost your damned mind?

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:17.937
This is far from over.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.174
I can make use of that madman.

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:23.409
[JIMBEI]
Keep your wits about you, Luffy!

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.312
[JIMBEI]
Fishmen are far stronger

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:30.416
than humans in the water.
Do not forget that!

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.918
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.920
I can't throw Luffy
too hard or he'll break through

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.255
the bubble and
go flying out to sea.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.825
So I'm gonna have
to do it extra carefully.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:41.127
With exactly the
right amount of force!

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.228
Now, Sanji!

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.198
Armee de L'air Assault.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.801
Gum Shoot!

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:55.174
[LUFFY yells]

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.222
[LUFFY]
Whoa! This thing's pretty big!

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:15.294
[LUFFY] I guess I'm
between the bubbles now?

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.467
[LUFFY] Wait, Hordy's
still under the bubble.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.476
We can't stop this thing.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.679
But if we can slow it down,
even just a little--

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:36.582
maybe she can get away!

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.050
Come on!

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.286
Don't let it catch her!

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.354
[FISHMAN EE]
Hurry, princess!

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:44.524
We'll try to slow it down!
You get somewhere safe!

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.497
Dammit! It's too heavy!

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.332
Are they crazy?

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.067
My people...

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.436
Who came up with that plan?

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.107
No matter how hard they pull,
that ship'll never move an inch!

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.209
Why don't I put you
out of your misery?

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:04.210
[gasps]

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.811
C'mon! Back off!

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.580
Shark Arrows!

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:09.549
[FISHMEN yelling]

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:11.117
Buncha worthless scum!

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.920
You're the reason humans look
down on our entire race!

00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:18.124
My kingdom has no place for
sentimental weaklings like you!

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.325
[yells]

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:20.560
[FISHMAN L groans]

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.094
[FISHMAN M yells]

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:24.630
If your pride as Fishmen
means nothing to you,

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:28.000
then your pathetic
lives mean nothing to me!

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.271
[FISHMEN screaming]

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.107
[HORDY] You've soiled
the name of our proud race!

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.643
This is the fate you deserve!

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:40.379
[laughs]

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.215
[FISHMEN screaming]

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.817
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.454
[SHIRAHOSHI]
No...

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:50.156
Dammit, Hordy!

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:51.757
We're sorry, Your Majesty.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:57.597
Just swim away! Hurry.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.432
I mustn't stop now!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.803
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I was right!

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:06.772
The entrance to
the palace is still open!

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:08.841
Just hang in there, buddy!

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.977
Hordy, how could you?

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.244
Heh.

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.049
She made it up to the gate!

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.986
[FISHMAN R]
She's swimming out to sea!

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.756
[FISHMAN FF]
The Noah's still on her tail!

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.225
[FISHMAN GG]
You can do it, Princess!

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.594
[SHIRAHOSHI panting]

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.165
[LUFFY]
It's going up!

00:10:37.503 --> 00:10:38.638
[LUFFY grunts]

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:45.478
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Ah!

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.314
I can't steer this thing!

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:54.320
[LUFFY grunting]

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:57.023
[HORDY]
Poor, feeble humans.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.257
Must be inconvenient.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.258
[gasps]

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.693
[HORDY]
You all act so high and mighty

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.561
when you're safe on land.

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.730
But here in the water,
you're not even a match

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:07.233
for the smallest Fishman child!

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.934
A man is only
as strong as he is

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.803
at his weakest, I'm afraid.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:13.239
You might be powerful
up on the island,

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.408
but you're in my territory now.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.979
Shut up and fight me!

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.992
[HORDY] You don't listen
very well do you?

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.495
You're not on
the ground anymore, kid!

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.231
[HORDY]
You think you can keep up,

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:41.967
while you're being tossed
around in that bubble?

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.936
I hate to break it to you,
but if you're worried

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:46.005
about Shirahoshi,
you're gonna be long dead

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.340
before that ship hits her.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.475
Speaking of the princess,

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:52.211
she did me a favor
going out to sea.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:55.114
You can send her a thank you
note from your watery grave!

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.849
[laughs]

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.120
Shark Arrows!

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.200
How's that Devil Fruit
power of yours working out,

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:17.903
by the way? How did
you think this would go?

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.706
How arrogant to think
you had a chance in the sea.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.808
[laughs]

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:25.077
Perhaps you understand at last.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.446
In the bitter end, you humans
will finally see that

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.749
you're unfit to rule this world!

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:32.485
A lesson learned
far too late, I'm afraid.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.490
[HORDY] Pathetic!
You can't even breathe!

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:41.160
All the fools who
enter these waters will pay

00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:43.829
a high price for
their arrogance.

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:48.100
It's far too late
now to beg for mercy!

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:50.836
But you're not even capable

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.505
of that anymore, are you?

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.473
Truly, such a
miserable creature!

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:57.510
Now prepare to rot in Hell!

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:03.048
[HORDY]
Heh.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.489
Back for more, are you?

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:16.962
[coughs]

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:21.267
Are you all right?
Speak to me, Luffy!

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.835
Hey, it's you!

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:26.405
[HORDY] Too bad that
kind gesture was in vain.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.508
Because I'm not
about to let you get away.

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.377
Now say goodbye!

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:37.149
[chuckles]

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:07.413
[FISHMAN DD]
Pull! Pull!

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.881
We can't stop this thing.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:12.051
But if we can slow it down,
even just a little--

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:14.653
maybe she can get away!

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.088
Come on!

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.591
Don't let it catch her!

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.093
[FISHMAN EE] Hurry, princess!
We'll try to slow it down!

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.562
You get somewhere safe!

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.197
[SHIRAHOSHI]
This isn't enough!

00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.166
If I want to save the
people of my Kingdom,

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:31.070
I have to lure the Noah
far away from the island!

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:33.672
As far as I possibly can!

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:36.775
[DECKEN laughs]

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:40.112
I almost forgot to
ask, Shirahoshi!

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.047
[laughs]

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.116
How does freedom feel?

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:46.585
After ten years, you're
no longer protected by

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:50.222
the cold stone walls of
the Hard Shell Tower!

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:52.258
And now, it's time
for you to bleed to death,

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.692
my darling.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.594
That is, unless you'd
rather be crushed by

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:58.564
the massive weight of the Noah!

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.000
But one teeny-tiny
little magic word can spare you

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:04.003
this dread fate,
and that's, "Yes!"

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.704
Simply utter that one word

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.907
and your troubles will be over!

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.475
I'm deeply sorry, Sir Decken,

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.110
but I simply can't do that!

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.178
Why must you refuse to marry me?

00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.747
Because you're not my type!

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.349
[screams]

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:19.652
[DECKEN groans, sighs]

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.231
I see. Then to Hell with you!

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:36.001
Die today,
and live for eternity!

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:39.038
Deep, within my poor,
miserable heart!

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.572
Then you'll be mine!

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.374
Figuratively at least!

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:43.909
[screams]

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.411
Ha!

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:47.913
[gasps]

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.615
You need to learn
how to treat a lady!

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.617
Or anybody, for that matter!

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.619
Shirahoshi is our baby sister!

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.821
We will never let you
lay a hand on her.

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:56.889
Not ever!

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.390
You came to save me!

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.025
And Hoe's here as well!

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:01.894
--Thank you!
--[HOE chirps]

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:05.698
Well hello, brothers-in-law!

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.599
[MANBOSHI, RYUBOSHI]
We are not your family!

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.805
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Oh, brothers!

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:16.108
Some of our people attempted to
save me, but then they were--

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.242
[sobs]

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.611
[MANBOSHI] Now's not the
time for tears, Shirahoshi!

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.214
Oh. Oh, please
don't get mad at me.

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:25.551
--[wails]
--I said don't cry!

00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:26.752
Focus, you two!

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.854
Father told us that we
shouldn't let any harm come

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:31.256
to the Noah-so-la-ti-do!

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.125
We have to find
a way to get it safely back

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:36.829
to the seafloor without letting
it hit anything along the way!

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:37.963
[RYUBOSHI]
Look out!

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.999
[GROUP screams]

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.133
Listen!

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.768
We need you to mambo
your way around

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.737
the underwater
mountains and trenches!

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.705
And don't rock the boat, baby!

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.340
[SHIRAHOSHI]
But there are so many obstacles!

00:16:48.374 --> 00:16:49.975
Where should I go?

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.744
[MANBOSHI growls]
Up there!

00:16:51.777 --> 00:16:53.912
The path should be
a lot clearer that way!

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:57.716
All right, I'll go!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.819
He won't get
away from mi-fa-so-la!

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.962
You will never escape, my love.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.398
It's as hopeless as you trying
to escape the hot pursuit

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.632
of the Noah!

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:17.569
I'll chase after you as long as
I have to, my beautiful bride!

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:21.006
[laughs]

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:26.979
Good thing you showed up.

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.280
Thanks a lot!

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:30.015
But you got hurt
pretty bad back there.

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.216
Are you okay?

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.419
[FUKABOSHI] My pain means
nothing when so many soldiers,

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:36.422
citizens, and royal family
members were attacked.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.058
Even my sister Shirahoshi's
trying her best to save

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:43.128
the Ryugu Kingdom,
despite the injury she suffered.

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:45.697
So you see,
there simply isn't time for me

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.767
to sit back and lick my wounds!

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.136
Well, in that case,
can ask you a favor?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.872
[FUKABOSHI] Forgive me, but
there's no time for that either.

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:58.944
Merfolk like them
are supposed to be

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:01.213
the fastest swimmers
in the whole world.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.949
But with my new power,
I can swim circles around them!

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.184
Not again!

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.455
Now, Shark Slicer!

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.027
[HORDY chuckles]

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.205
Okay, do not
let us get hit by that.

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:29.241
[HORDY] Perhaps I'll
slice you into nice filets.

00:18:29.274 --> 00:18:32.244
Then I can feed your flesh
to the little fishes!

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.812
A prince of the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:36.315
and a pirate who's
worth 400 million.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.684
They're sure to enjoy that meal.

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:41.153
[laughs]

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.588
Go!

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.490
[FUKABOSHI] Regardless
of where his power comes from,

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.592
his speed is undeniable!

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.494
Hold on tightly, Straw Hat!

00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.790
[laughs]

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.026
He's cutting through
stuff just like Zoro!

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.661
This is crazy!

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.930
[FUKABOSHI] You should save
your admiration for later!

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.568
No matter which
way you cowards go,

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:33.105
you can never outswim the
blade of my Shark Slicer!

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.913
Hoping you'll lose me
in this cloud of dust, are you?

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.383
[HORDY yells]

00:19:57.262 --> 00:19:58.530
The Noah!

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:03.068
[DECKEN laughs]
Shirahoshi!

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:05.304
What happened?

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:08.640
Hey, we need to get
on top of that ship, quick!

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:10.442
Damn you, Decken!

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:11.710
I assume this is the favor

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:15.214
you were going to ask before.
But I fail to see the purpose.

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.583
It's something Jimbei told me.

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:20.219
But the ship's in a bubble,
so it should be okay!

00:20:20.252 --> 00:20:21.653
That would make sense.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:24.723
Decken is weak to
sea water, just like you.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:28.193
Despite being a Fishman, he
needs air to move around freely.

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.462
It'll be easier
for me to fight there.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:32.598
And I'm about ready to
kick the crap out of Hordy

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.700
and that weirdo who
likes to throw stuff.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.301
Besides, I promised Weepyhoshi

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:37.703
when we left the tower.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.005
I'm supposed to make
sure she's safe!

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:42.574
It seems we are of one mind.

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.276
And just like our father,

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:46.778
your sons will become
noble warriors.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:49.548
[sobs]

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.949
With all of our strength,

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:54.853
we will protect Shirahoshi
in body and spirit alike.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:57.055
I made the same promise.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.625
Yet we allowed ourselves
be bested by a scoundrel

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:01.727
who draws his power
from some drug.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.564
It seems I've failed to keep
my word to our late mother!

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:08.066
I also regret being
suspicious of you at first--

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.768
[LUFFY]
Eh, it's no big deal.

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.136
Let's head to the deck!

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.038
I've got business there, too.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:15.774
What is this?

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:18.477
[HORDY] I can eliminate
Straw Hat anytime.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.579
But there's another issue
I need to take care of

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:23.515
that simply cannot
wait any longer.

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:25.217
What are you waiting for? C'mon!

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.486
No. We must be cautious.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.987
What do you mean "no"?

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:30.555
[FUKABOSHI]
He's up to something.

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:32.124
More than that,
we must be prepared

00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:34.226
for another encounter
underwater.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.862
Clearly, our prior
approach was inadequate.

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:39.331
[LUFFY]
So what do we do?

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.633
I have an idea.

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.268
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Please, come on!

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.803
Higher!

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.640
You've lived
with my Mark-Mark Curse

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:51.276
long enough to know
you can't escape.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.178
And unlike those
axes your little tower

00:21:53.211 --> 00:21:56.014
protected you from, there's
nothing in this wide world that

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:59.351
can stop the Noah from
crushing you to itty bitty bits!

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:02.187
[laughs]

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:09.261
Goodness!
If it isn't Hordy Jones!

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:10.796
[laughs]

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:13.098
Say, whatever
happened to Neptune?

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:14.733
Dead maybe?

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.735
By the way,
I'm using the Noah to torture

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:21.306
Shirahoshi as we speak!
A genius idea on my part!

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.008
Don't you think, Brother?

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:25.877
[laughs]

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:26.878
It's not bad,

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.181
but I think I've got
an even better idea.

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:35.253
[laughs]
Do you now? Well, let's hear it!

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:37.556
[DECKEN]
Huh...?

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.858
Actually, it's better
if I show you.

00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:43.195
--[slashing]
--[DECKEN groans]

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.705
[DECKEN rasping]

00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:58.744
If you died,
what would become of this ship?

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.486
[HORDY]
Well, Decken?

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:15.627
[NARRATOR] Hordy's unexpected
assault on Decken

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.463
threatens to destroy all of
Fishman Island.

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:21.800
Yet, even as impending doom
looms in the sky above them,

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:23.735
the Straw Hats continue
their struggle at

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.337
the bottom of the sea.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.506
The appearance of a new ally
gives Luffy a chance

00:23:27.539 --> 00:23:30.342
to protect Shirahoshi,
but it will take much more

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.944
than that to turn the save
the rest of the island.

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:34.546
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:37.949
"The Fierce Fight Begins!
Luffy vs. Hordy!"
