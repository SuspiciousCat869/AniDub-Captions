1
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,607
[LUFFY] Do whatever
you want with the Merry.

2
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,113
I won't let anything
hold us back.

3
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,616
We're getting a new ship
and sailing forward.

4
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:41,094
[LUFFY] So long, Usopp.
It was fun while it lasted.

5
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,073
[ZORO]
You can't doubt yourself.

6
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,746
In times like these if
you lose your confidence

7
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,481
then who can we have faith in?

8
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,318
[ZORO]
Let's pack our things and go.

9
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,157
You know as well as
me that after tonight

10
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,026
we can never return
to this ship again.

11
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,045
[LUFFY]

12
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,484
[REPORTER A] Who was
the first to find him?

13
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,386
[REPORTER B] Could they please
answer a few questions for us?

14
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,488
[REPORTER C] Who's the culprit?
Are there any suspects?

15
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,090
[REPORTER C] Is there any
connection between this

16
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,491
and the annihilation
of the Franky House?

17
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,625
[REPORTER A]
What's his condition?

18
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,294
[REPORTER C] Could you
give us a statement, please?!

19
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,562
[CITIZEN A] Hey, did you
hear about what happened

20
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,397
at the Shipbuilding
island last night?

21
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,433
[CITIZEN B] Is it true?
Did he die?

22
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,235
Franky did this,
I just know it!

23
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,769
You let someone like
that run around free

24
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,204
and this is what happens!

25
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,405
Well, it might've
been those pirates

26
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,208
who've been hangin' around
the shipyard the past few days.

27
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,378
Word is, there was an explosion
out at the cape last night.

28
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,679
[CITIZEN E] You think
there's a connection?

29
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,747
[CITIZEN]
I don't know for sure,

30
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,182
but there've
been a few pirates

31
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,050
fighting with the
foremen recently.

32
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,107
So this is
where you've been.

33
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,445
[SANJI] We went through all
the trouble of renting a room,

34
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,115
and no one's using it.

35
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:47,755
I guess nobody
could sleep, huh?

36
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,390
And where's Luffy?

37
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,790
Over there.

38
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
[CHOPPER]
So, where were you?

39
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,403
I kept lookout around
the rocky cape all night.

40
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:05,606
I wanted to be there
in case Robin came back.

41
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,340
[CHOPPER]
Oh.

42
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,514
She never said
anything about leaving.

43
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,515
I wonder where she went.

44
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,422
Ever since we
got to this island

45
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,791
it's been one bad
thing after another.

46
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:27,428
Our money was stolen and
then there's everything

47
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,463
that happened to poor Usopp.

48
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,698
He's injured.

49
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:34,068
He could barely even
stand up and by now,

50
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,770
on top of everything else,
he's probably got a fever!

51
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,639
[ZORO]
Chopper.

52
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,241
That's enough, okay?

53
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,442
Don't talk about him anymore.

54
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,686
[SANJI] I think I'll try looking
around for her in town today.

55
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,422
[CHOPPER] Do you think
we're gonna find her?

56
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,224
[SANJI]
Who knows?

57
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,527
It's not like I have any place
specific in mind to check out.

58
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,266
I just feel certain that
she's still here somewhere.

59
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,600
If anything should happen,

60
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,703
we should use this inn
as our meet-up point.

61
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,672
I wanna help!
I'm gonna come, too!

62
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,241
All right, then. Come on.

63
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,409
Luffy!

64
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,344
[SANJI]
Nami! What's wrong?

65
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,779
[NAMI]
It's awful!

66
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,182
The whole city's
talking about it!

67
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,118
Luffy, listen to me.

68
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,320
Last night, something
terrible happened to Iceberg!

69
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,059
[PAULIE] What?! Iceberg
was shot in his home?!

70
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,727
Stop screwing around!

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,396
Is this some kind of joke?

72
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:35,829
[LULU]
No joke.

73
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:36,863
Is he alive?

74
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,599
Who would do such a thing?
Everyone loves him!

75
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:41,268
[LULU] Yes, he's alive!
Calm down, Paulie!

76
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,704
Listen to me for
a second, okay?

77
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,273
He was discovered in his
room earlier this morning

78
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:49,310
lying in a pool
of his own blood.

79
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,345
Like I said: He's alive,

80
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,714
but he's been unconscious
since he was found.

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,551
You need to come to the
main office immediately!

82
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,690
[KAKU]
Lulu! Where's Paulie?

83
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,327
[LULU] I just called him.
He'll be here soon.

84
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,663
[KAKU] Good. Reporters
are all over the place.

85
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,633
It's mass hysteria out there.

86
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,135
We're the ones who'd like
to know what happened.

87
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,670
The office has
been torn apart,

88
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,039
but there's no trace of
anything being stolen.

89
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:23,077
No money, no valuables, nothing.

90
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,746
If this wasn't a robbery
then the question is:

91
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,782
Who would try to
kill Iceberg, and why?

92
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,486
At any rate, we're
in big trouble here.

93
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,422
The city's in total panic.

94
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,324
If anything should
happen to Iceberg,

95
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,760
then it's not only the end
for the Galley-La Company,

96
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,163
but the entire city
of Water 7, as well.

97
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,280
Doctor, please.
What is his condition?

98
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,225
He was shot two
times in the front

99
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,727
and another three from behind.

100
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,097
I have no idea what happened
in that room last night

101
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,200
but whatever it was,
it was brutal.

102
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,903
[LUL]
According to forensics,

103
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,706
there's no sign of the locks
being picked to his office

104
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,208
or anywhere else
in the building.

105
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,411
The incident occurred in a
room no one could have entered.

106
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,782
The only thing out-of-place
they found was a mask

107
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,317
you can buy just
about anywhere.

108
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,658
Ice Pops from the shipyard?

109
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,329
[NAMI] Yes. I've heard
he's still unconscious.

110
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,665
I thought everybody in this
entire city loved that guy.

111
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,067
Why him?

112
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,535
[SANJI]
Who're you talking about?

113
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,471
He's the nice man that helped
us out so much yesterday.

114
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,206
The president of the
shipbuilding company

115
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,442
as well as the
mayor of Water 7.

116
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,711
[SANJI] Hmm, sounds
like an important guy.

117
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,247
[NAMI] Yeah, it's pretty
much the worst thing

118
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,582
that could've
happened to this town.

119
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,150
I'll go check on him.

120
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,453
Luffy! Wait up!
I'm coming, too!

121
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,259
[SANJI] On that note,
let's go look for Robin.

122
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,793
Come on, Chopper.

123
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,496
What about you?

124
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,066
[ZORO] Well, I think I'll
just wait awhile.

125
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,701
See how things turn out.

126
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:34,341
[NEWSPAPER GUY A] Extra!
Extra! Read all about it!

127
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,778
Iceberg, our beloved mayor
and the hero of Water 7,

128
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,115
has fallen victim to
the hands of an assassin!

129
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,817
This is an urgent news
report covering the incident!

130
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,719
This is terrible!
Is Iceberg okay?

131
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,589
How awful! Who would
do such a thing?

132
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,090
[CITIZEN H] Hey!
Gimme one of those!

133
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,924
[CITIZEN I]
Who did it?

134
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,758
[CITIZEN J]
It doesn't say. No clue.

135
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,792
[CITIZEN K] You,
with the newspapers!

136
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,195
There's some crucial
information missing here!

137
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,162
[CITIZEN F]
What's the deal?

138
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,165
[CITIZEN J] Doesn't
anybody know anything?!

139
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,433
[CITIZEN H]
What's going on?

140
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,302
Only pirates would
pull a vicious attack

141
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,571
like that out of nowhere.
No doubt about it.

142
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,773
I'd like to get my hands
on the ones that did it!

143
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,075
There were a bunch
of pirates rampaging

144
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,743
through Dock #1
just yesterday!

145
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,413
[CITIZEN M] You mean
the Mikazuki gang?

146
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,148
I know it sounds crazy

147
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,383
but I think the
government did this.

148
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,752
What? What're
you saying?

149
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,188
I'm talking about Corgy.

150
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,557
Every time he comes
to talk with Iceberg,

151
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,560
he gets rejected and leaves.

152
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,296
I'm telling you,
Franky did it!

153
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:32,166
I don't really know what he's
trying to speak with him about

154
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,602
but he must have
done this out of spite.

155
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,737
I'd keep that theory to myself.

156
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,372
If you openly blame
the World Government,

157
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,575
it won't be taken lightly.

158
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,677
[NEWSPAPER GUY A]
Is this diabolical criminal's

159
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,646
goal to gain wealth or power?

160
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,214
Who is this
nameless assassin

161
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,316
that disappeared
without a trace?

162
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,254
Who in the
hell did this?

163
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,789
I'm not gonna let
them get away with it!

164
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,229
[ANNOUNCEMENT] Thank you
for riding the sea-train.

165
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,165
Next stop: The Blue
Station at Water Seven.

166
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,500
Arriving momentarily.

167
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,644
[REPORTER D]
Paulie!

168
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:52,146
[REPORTER E]
A word, please!

169
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,280
Can we get a comment
about this incident?

170
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,449
[REPORTER F] What were you
told before you came here?

171
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,750
Shut up, all of you.

172
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,053
Get the hell outta my way.

173
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,287
Tell us what explanation

174
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,555
you were given
by your company!

175
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,622
[REPORTER G]
Paulie, please! A comment?

176
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:05,559
I don't have time for
this crap! Get outta here!

177
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,626
[REPORTER D]
Are you aware of any incident

178
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,762
that could cause someone
to target Iceberg's life?

179
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:09,596
Anything at all!

180
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:10,564
[REPORTER E]
There must be something!

181
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,566
[REPORTER F]
Any altercations with pirates?

182
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,467
[REPORTER G] Paulie!
Won't you please--

183
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,736
Didn't you
idiots hear me?

184
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:18,238
Get outta here!

185
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,475
[NAMI]
Luffy! Down here!

186
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,452
Right! Move it, Yagara!

187
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,757
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

188
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,226
Good. Then let's get going.

189
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,332
[NAMI] Take a look.
It's all about Iceberg.

190
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:49,670
Huh?

191
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,605
So I guess the
rumors are true.

192
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,240
He <i>was</i> attacked.

193
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,342
Yeah. So if we
go to the shipyard,

194
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,711
it's likely we won't be
able to meet with him.

195
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,147
[LUFFY] Then let's
just go to his house.

196
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,016
[NAMI] I believe he lives
inside the main office.

197
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,785
[USOPP]
It happened 'cause I'm weak.

198
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:42,255
They took... They took
all of the money.

199
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:48,696
How can I face the others now?

200
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,731
[sobbing]

201
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:56,403
We were finally
able to fix the Merry.

202
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,046
[LUFFY]
Nami.

203
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,114
Eh?

204
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,182
[LUFFY] What are
you thinking about?

205
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,057
It's nothing.

206
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,414
[FRANKY]
Kiwi, Mozu.

207
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:45,052
Am I asleep? Is this a dream?

208
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,654
This is no dream.

209
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,489
Without a doubt,
this is the very spot

210
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,557
where the
Franky House stood.

211
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,726
But something
like this happening.

212
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,794
Just seems so extreme.

213
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:03,136
[FRANKY]
What the hell is going on?!

214
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,150
[FRANKY]
Who would be stupid enough

215
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:19,686
to do something like
this to my house?!

216
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,625
Hold on. I know who.

217
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,794
Damn you, Straw Hat Luffy!

218
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,728
So this is your payback

219
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,298
for us stealing your
200 million berries?

220
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,069
How dare you treat my
faithful men this way!

221
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,805
It's so heartless!

222
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,207
[FRANKY]
Unforgivable!

223
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,376
Franky! Bro!

224
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,778
You came back!
Thank goodness!

225
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,580
[FRANKY]
You guys are all right?

226
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,482
What a relief. Thank goodness.

227
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,220
[ZAMBAI]
It was terrible!

228
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,390
Those pirates are
completely insane!

229
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:56,957
Listen.

230
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,791
We've been keeping track

231
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:00,327
of what the
Straw Hats are up to.

232
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,629
We know there's
no way you're gonna

233
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,697
let them get away with this!

234
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,666
Where are they now?

235
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,502
[SCARFHEAD] We saw
them going into an inn.

236
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,570
[BEARDFACE] After that,
they headed over

237
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,739
to the shipbuilding island.

238
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,140
It's Dock 1.

239
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:13,941
They were there yesterday.

240
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,143
I bet that's where
they're going.

241
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:20,214
[FRANKY]
Is that so? All right then.

242
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,383
Straw Hat Luffy.

243
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:26,152
When I find you,
I'm gonna rip you apart.

244
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:37,197
Whoa! Granny! Granny!

245
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,100
The wind is blowing like crazy!

246
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,574
[CHIMNEY] Crazy wind!
Crazy Wind! Crazy Wind!

247
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,776
[KOKORO] Enough already!
Keep it down!

248
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:57,083
The southern wind, huh?
Must be Karock.

249
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,161
[KOKORO] The waves
are getting rough, too.

250
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,128
If this keeps up,

251
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:12,366
the Sea Train won't
be able to run tonight.

252
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,201
[KOKORO] Chimney!
Gonbe! Get ready!

253
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:15,536
We're going back
to the island!

254
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,604
Okay!

255
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,248
Aqua Laguna is coming.

256
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:36,690
[emergency siren blaring]

257
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,825
[ANNOUCEMENT]
Your attention, please!

258
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,660
Your attention please!

259
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:42,529
This is the Water Seven
Weather Forecasting Center.

260
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,466
As of now, an Aqua Laguna
severe weather warning

261
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,735
has just been issued
for the entire island.

262
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:49,603
Its arrival time
is estimated to be

263
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,072
sometime between
midnight and 12:30.

264
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,408
[CITIZEN O] Oh yeah,
I guess it is about that time.

265
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:55,175
[CITIZEN P]
I've been preoccupied

266
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,111
with what
happened to Iceberg.

267
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,280
[CITIZEN Q] Hey!
Aqua Laguna is coming!

268
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,149
Make sure everybody
knows about the warning!

269
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,551
[CITIZEN R] All right,
no more work for today!

270
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,719
What'd he say?

271
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,690
Aqua Laguna?
Oh! Excuse me!

272
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:12,126
What was that broadcast
about just now?

273
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:12,793
[CITIZEN S]
What do you mean?

274
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,728
Everybody knows what-- Oh!

275
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,097
Wait, are you
visitor here? Sorry.

276
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,532
You've come sightseeing
at a really bad time.

277
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,136
Aqua Laguna is
an annual storm.

278
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,271
It's about to
pass through here.

279
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,539
[SANJI]
A storm, huh?

280
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,573
A big one.

281
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,243
You're gonna need to
evacuate to higher ground.

282
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:32,046
This entire city will
be underwater soon.

283
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,715
Underwater? Really?

284
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:35,649
[CITIZEN S] Don't worry!

285
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:37,384
It's not going to happen
right this second!

286
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,251
According to the forecast,

287
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,354
it'll arrive sometime
around midnight.

288
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,256
The locals have
gotten used to it.

289
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,224

290
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,693
[SANJI]
Later!

291
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:48,095
[CHOPPER] Hmm, the
whole town will be...

292
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,331
Wait! It's gonna sink?!

293
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:52,066
Yeah, apparently so.

294
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,301
We need to find Robin
and quick. Come on.

295
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,338
Right!

296
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,305
By the way,

297
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,274
where do you think we
should look for her?

298
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,642
[SANJI]
Good question.

299
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:04,278
Where would she
likely go around here?

300
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:08,682
[CHOPPER] Hmm? Let's see.
[Ancient ruins maybe?

301
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,718
Nope. Nothing like
that in this place.

302
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,219
Where else?

303
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,555
[CHOPPER]
Uh.

304
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,090
[SANJI]
Is there anything she likes?

305
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,024
[CHOPPER]
Ancient ruins!

306
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:19,093
Stop saying that!
There aren't any here!

307
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:21,161
Fine! Then you tell me
what else she likes!

308
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,597
[SANJI] I asked you
because I don't know!

309
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,633
Hey! Don't get in
front of me! Got it?

310
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,133
[CHOPPER]
Why not?!

311
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,109
[SANJI]
Huh. When you think about it,

312
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:38,111
we really don't know that
much about Robin, do we?

313
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:41,815
Can't you tell us anything?

314
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,350
Hey! Iceberg!

315
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,252

What's going on?

317
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,157
We can't go that way.

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,226
Man, we're never gonna
find out what's going on

319

unless we find some
way to get to Ice Pops.

Uhm, excuse me!

00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,465
Can you tell me where the
entrance of the main office is?

322
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,134
Yeah, it's at Dock 1.

323
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,503
But I don't think you're gonna
have any luck getting in.

324

that happened here,

they're only allowing authorized
personnel to get through.
