[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:46.199
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.571
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:51.810
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.714
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.033
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.569
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:08.242
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:12.685
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:17.061
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:18.698
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:24.610
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:26.747
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.555
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:31.890
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:34.395
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.466
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.573
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:42.010
Okay. You ready?

00:03:42.043 --> 00:03:44.816
Spring Hopper!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.920
Let's go!

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.032
You got stronger since last
time, but I got stronger, too!

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.039
You wanna see destructive power?

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:58.777
I've taken this to the max!

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:07.327
[LUFFY] "The Battle of Love!
The New Leader Sai vs. Baby 5!"

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.880
What are you doing, Bellamy?

00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.097
You're finally free!

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.234
Now cut it out, before you die!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.676
Pathetic! Stop showing
mercy to your enemy!

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.722
[grunting]

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:44.836

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Lord Pica!

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:56.092
Aim at me! You're attacking
all over the place!

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.394
Look around!

00:04:57.427 --> 00:04:59.700
The only ones you're
hurting are your own men!

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:03.508
[laughs]

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.546
I'm gonna cut you to pieces.

00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.087
[SAI]
Try to keep up!

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.624
Okay!

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:14.261
[BABY 5]
I can't believe it! He needs me!

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.399
He really needs me!

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:18.136
I won't let you go!

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.405
We have to settle this!

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:21.911
You took the words
right outta my mouth!

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:23.446
Just you and me, lady!

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.718
I'm not leaving, I promise you!

00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:29.659
[BABY 5] Ah? He just said
that he'll never leave me.

00:05:30.394 --> 00:05:31.930
That was a proposal, huh?

00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:35.036
Where the hell did you
get that crazy idea?

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.923
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

[LAO G]
G!

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.898
I see! His secret technique!

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
The deadly Back-Pain Stance!

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:09.639
Not done yet.

[grunting]

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.269
That's the true
power of old age!

00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:02.077
Chin Jao's bounty is huge,
but he's just not old enough!

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.616
[LAO G] No one understands
the meaning of pain

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.318
better than the elderly!

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:08.591
That is the greatness
of Geo Fist.

00:07:08.624 --> 00:07:12.163
With a capital G!

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:19.378
Hey, uh, excuse me. Lao G, sir?

00:07:19.412 --> 00:07:22.618
Don Chin Jao is that way.

--[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]
--Your engagement!

00:07:35.545 --> 00:07:37.081
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Who're you even talking to?

00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:38.584
[SAI] What are you
talking about, old man?!

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:39.720
There's no engagement!

00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:40.988
You're not marrying me?

00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:44.061
Why's that so shocking
to you? We're fighting!

00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:48.403
[CHIN JAO] Sai! You're already
arranged to marry Ooklicia,

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:51.643
the daughter of the
Nihosui Army's leader!

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:54.916
Hi, Sai!

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:55.985
I know that!

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:59.593
Frankly, I don't give
a damn who I marry!

00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:02.330
You make whatever
political alliance you want!

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:05.704
I don't care about romance,
so it's all the same to me!

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:06.974
You've done it now!

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:09.212
Only a fool would dare
to ignore Lao G!

00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:11.215
He's gonna be so angry!

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.731
[LAO G]
Huh?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.768
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
He didn't hear a word they said!

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.805
Wait a second. He is angry!

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:26.546
Look! There's an aura of rage
steaming off of his head!

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.287
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
That's his soul!

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.091
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Guess he reached the natural end

00:08:32.124 --> 00:08:33.159
of his life!

00:08:33.193 --> 00:08:34.261
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
Yeah, okay, but kinda

00:08:34.295 --> 00:08:35.631
awkward timing, isn't it?

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:37.300
No! It can't be!

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:39.539
Lao G! Stay with us!

00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:41.543
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
We need you!

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.614
Please, come back!

00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:47.421
Back. Back. Back.

00:08:47.454 --> 00:08:48.924
[LAO G]
Hm?

00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:53.066
[LAO G]
Ha?

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.003
He couldn't understand
what we said,

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:56.540
but he came back anyway!

00:08:56.574 --> 00:08:57.875
Oh, thank goodness!

00:08:57.908 --> 00:09:00.179
[LAO G laughs]

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:04.054
I see the rigors of age
have not been kind to you!

00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:06.158
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Look who's talking!

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.365
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Uh-oh! He means business!

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.101
I've had enough, Sai!

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:13.741
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Chin Jao's got family drama!

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.578
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
He couldn't hear, anyway!

00:09:15.612 --> 00:09:17.582
Let's discuss this
another time, okay?

00:09:17.615 --> 00:09:19.485
Your collar was crooked. There!

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:23.827
Damn it! You're not

Stay away from me, you freak!

[BABY 5 gasps]
That's awful!

00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:31.644
[gasps] I don't understand you.

00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:33.413
What is your end game?

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:35.116
Are you trying to seduce me?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.789
We're supposed to be fighting,
not getting married!

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:40.093
[BABY 5] Why would I fight you,
when you need me?

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:43.534
Let me be useful!
Tell me what I can do!

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:48.644
[chuckles] Oh, really!
Y'wanna help me?

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:50.548
Then why don't you die?

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.016
[gasps]

00:09:53.385 --> 00:09:55.156
If I let you
walk away from this,

00:09:55.189 --> 00:09:58.095
and you cause trouble for
Straw Hat and his friends,

00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:00.768
then my debt will
never be repaid!

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:03.741
We're laying our lives down
to defeat you Executives!

00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:05.443
That's the least we can do!

00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:08.249
So fight me or die!

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:11.388
[BABY 5]
That's what you want?

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:13.994
Huh?

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:23.580
No problem!
Then I'll die happily.

00:10:23.614 --> 00:10:26.085
I don't mind at all,
if it'll help you.

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:27.789
[gasps] Uh, wait.

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:30.762
I love helping people
more than anything in the world.

00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:32.632
I'm glad you need me.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.603
Cut that out! I was kidding!

00:10:34.636 --> 00:10:36.707
Just trash-talking my enemy!

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.910
I can't let our battle
conclude this way!

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:41.115
I'd regret it for
the rest of my life!

00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:42.919
[CHIN JAO]
What are you doing, Sai?

00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:45.457
Your enemy wants to
kill herself, doesn't she?

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.593
Let her!

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:49.298
Just who are you
fighting for, anyway?

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:50.466
What?

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:51.970
[CHIN JAO]
As a leader of our army,

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:54.241
you can't afford to show mercy!

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:55.778
Shut up, old man!

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:59.051
You're not my master
anymore, so cram it!

[SAI]
Hey! Stop!

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:09.505
[BABY 5]
To be useful, even in death.

00:11:09.538 --> 00:11:12.277
This is all that
I've ever wanted.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.152
[TRIBESMAN A sighs]
Why did you have a child?

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:18.489
[TRIBESWOMAN A] She won't
contribute a damned thing,

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:20.226
but she'll eat plenty, I'm sure!

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.932
[TRIBESMAN A]
We have too many mouths to feed.

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:26.004
Take her to the mountain
and leave her there.

00:11:26.806 --> 00:11:29.646
[BABY 5]
Mommy, where are we going?

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.983
Why are you so quiet?

00:11:33.553 --> 00:11:36.358
Mommy? [gasps]

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:41.703
Mommy! Don't leave
me here, please! No!

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:47.915
[BABY 5'S MOTHER]
Stop following me.

00:11:47.948 --> 00:11:51.656
No, Mommy, take me with you,
this place is scary!

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.866
[sighs] I'm leaving you
because you're useless.

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:59.839
You're not wanted
or needed, okay?

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:04.882
[BABY 5'S MOTHER] Not by this
world and not by anyone in it.

00:12:06.052 --> 00:12:11.428
[BABY 5] Even you? Even you
don't need me, Mommy?

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:19.377
[crying]

00:12:21.716 --> 00:12:25.657
So it'll help you if
I buy 50 subscriptions?

00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.697
They need me! I'm so glad!

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.503
[BABY 5 gasps]
You want me to marry you?

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:33.907
Well, if you really need me!

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.947
You're not wanted
or needed, okay?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.887
Not by this world
and not by anyone in it.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.827
[BABY 5]
You were wrong, Mother.

00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:46.600
Now, someone does need me.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:49.438

I said stop, you stupid broad!

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.408
You're the one who's stupid!

[CHIN JAO]
Damn you, Sai!

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:09.244
You're a disgrace
to the Happosui Army!

00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:11.281
[CHIN JAO]
Either correct your actions

00:13:11.315 --> 00:13:14.421
or resign from your
post immediately!

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:22.203
You fool! Are you
listening to me?

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:28.883
This is my problem!
So stay out of it, old man!

Like hell I will!

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:35.262
Hasshoken Technique!

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:39.905
This is scary! His headbutt
can split a glacier in half!

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.277
[CHIN JAO] I'll set you
straight with my drill head!

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.816
And that goes for
the both of you!

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.090
Drill Dragon. Nail!

[BABY 5'S MOTHER]
You're not wanted or needed.

00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:49.678
Not by this world
and not by anyone.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:53.152
[BABY 5]
I've finally found my place.

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:55.357
This is all I could ask for.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.659
[gasps]

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:02.303
You need to value your

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:19.404
[SAI gasps]

00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:36.372
[BABY 5] I don't understand.
Why did you stop me?

00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:37.742
Let me die!

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:40.781
Isn't that the only way
I can help you?

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:45.958
If I die, I can finally be
useful to someone, can't I?

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:50.567
Poor girl. The world
you live in is twisted.

00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:53.540
They taught you all wrong.

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:55.042
[gasps]

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:10.173
Don Chin Jao's famous
drill head is bent sideways!

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.812
I can't believe I did that.

00:16:12.845 --> 00:16:15.951
My attack was that powerful?

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:17.521
[CHIN JAO]
You're surprised?

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:21.930
You're not the one whose head
is bent at a 90-degree angle!

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:24.502
They're gonna fight
to the death, aren't they?

00:16:24.535 --> 00:16:27.206
At long last...

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.381
...your power has awakened,
and your form is true!

00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:33.085
Though your training
was filled with

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:37.327
blood, sweat, and tears,
it has indeed borne fruit!

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.596
Gramps, I--

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.265
I'm so proud of you.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:45.309
The Hasshoken technique has
finally found its true heir.

00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:46.513
Sai.

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:50.587
Your kick shall inherit
the title "Drill Dragon Nail"

00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:53.760
as my head did before it.

knowing that you can
split the continent of ice.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.247
The Happosui Army is yours.

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.053
Truly and completely, now.

00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:10.193
I shall cancel your

you're embarrassing me here!

Truly a touching story!

[CHIN JAO]
To be frank, my chronic pain

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:30.166
has been acting up since
the battle with Straw Hat

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:33.907
and I haven't been able to
fight to my true potential.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.744
I'm no spring chicken.

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:39.117
I had started to worry.
But now I know my legacy--

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.526
Battle Insurance Fist!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.203
A safety precaution to
counteract infirmary or old age.

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.542
By performing qigong exercises,

00:18:24.576 --> 00:18:28.482
you can store away muscle from
your prime to draw upon later.

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:31.322
Now, I have combined
the experience of age

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:33.092
with the vitality of youth!

respect the elderly, huh?

I'll avenge my gramps
and pay back

I owe to Straw Hat.

What a foolish ape!

Straw Hat will not
defeat the young master!

00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:17.814
