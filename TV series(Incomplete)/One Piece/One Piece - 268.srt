1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,637
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,439
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,176
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,361
Franky and Robin have been
taken to the Tower of Law.

5
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,270
I couldn't be happier!

6
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:37,471
Amazing work.

7
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:42,776
You survived the "accident"
eight years ago, Cutty Flam.

8
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,114
Without sacrifice,
goals cannot be achieved.

9
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,683
I mean, this is world
peace we're working for!

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,284
It's not easy!

11
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,254
Crazy bastard!

12
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,324
Tom put his life on the line
to protect those blueprints!

13
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,726
Because idiots like you exist!

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,701
Yoyoi!

15
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,274
Meanwhile, Luffy was on
Enies Lobby's main island,

16
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,676
facing off against
10,000 marines.

17
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,486
Chief Spandam!

18
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,453
Please, come in!

19
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,688
We need your orders, sir!

20
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,290
We can't stop Straw Hat Luffy!

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,736
They breached the gate!

22
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,075
After waiting five minutes
for the front gate to be opened,

23
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,078
Zoro and the other Straw Hats
riding on Rocketman prepared

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,179
to attack in full force.

25
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,183
This is bad!

26
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,184
We're gonna crash!

27
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,619
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

28
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,119
What are we gonna do?

29
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:01,288
Dodge it, Kokoro!

30
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,558
I've got a plan.

31
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,159
Don't worry.

32
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,437
With a quick change of plans,

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,240
Rocketman took to the sky
and sailed onto the island.

34
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,291
What?

35
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,125
Impossible!

36
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,459
Who are those two?

37
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,775
Bazooka Unit forward!

38
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,347
I don't have time for this.

39
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,487
Should I try it or not?

40
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,421
Good.

41
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,055
Right there.

42
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,426
Fire!

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,498
We got him!

44
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,300
He fell down the waterfall!

45
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,509
Hey, look!

46
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,378
He's still hanging
onto the edge!

47
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,515
That's quite a fix!

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,517
But don't worry,
if you surrender peacefully,

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,185
we'll be glad to pull you up.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,253
Yeah, right!

51
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,721
You stubborn little punk!

52
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,723
Just die already!

53
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,590
Take that!

54
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,492
Hey, get over here
and help me, guys!

55
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,693
Roger!

56
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,599
Hey, he went to that side!

57
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,600
This way! This way!

58
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,342
Lucky me!

59
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,282
It's Straw Hat!

60
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,187
Wow, this really turned
into a big mess, didn't it?

61
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,091
Huh, I wish I could just
beat 'em all at once.

62
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,225
Guess I should
try to make a break

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,327
for that fancy looking building.

64
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,096
Here goes.

65
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:22,730
He went that way!

66
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,164
After him!

67
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,769
You're too heavy.

68
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,438
The guys on the bottom
have gotta climb up first.

69
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,374
Okay, but take it slow.

70
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,508
Real slow!

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,609
Stop swinging!

72
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,443
It wasn't me!

73
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,344
It was the wind!

74
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,479
Well, tell the wind
to stop it, then!

75
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,177
Hey wait!

76
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,812
I think I know that
guy with the sword!

77
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:52,746
Yeah!

78
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,248
He's one of
Straw Hat Luffy's Henchmen.

79
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,082
Pirate Hunter Zoro!

80
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,085
Henchman, huh?

81
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,386
Least he recognized me.

82
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,654
You're not even a henchman.

83
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,423
You're Pirate A.

84
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,557
What was that?

85
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,358
Maybe "B"?

86
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,860
Listen, when I get a bounty,

87
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,063
it's gonna be twice
as much as yours.

88
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,297
Whatever, Pirate C.

89
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,433
Stop changing it!

90
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,268
Hey, stop you two.

91
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,070
I don't think they can
hear you, Sniper King.

92
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:16,704
Don't worry.

93
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,539
It's all part of my plan.

94
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,541
I don't get it,
but it sounds cool.

95
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,643
There's more of them over there!

96
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,044
They found us!

97
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,579
Some might be
hiding on the train!

98
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,446
Blow it up!

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,682
Hey! Stop!
Nami's still inside there!

100
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,716
Fire!

101
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,392
Dammit.

102
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,060
If they harmed a hair
on her head, I swear--

103
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,495
Hold on a second, Pirate A.

104
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,462
What?

105
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,698
Nami isn't a background
character like you--

106
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,665
it's gonna take more than one

107
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,335
sorry little bazooka
attack to defeat her.

108
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,437
Listen, you henchman,
for the last time--

109
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,108
That hurt!

110
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,811
Huh?

111
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,348
Are you okay, Sniper King?

112
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,484
Never better, my friend.

113
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,118
Whoa!

114
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,486
Cease fire!

115
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,087
What's wrong?

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,088
See for yourself!

117
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,623
Hi!

118
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,724
Don't shoot!

119
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,393
I'm just an old lady!

120
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,395
I'm a little girl
with a kitty cat!

121
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,130
We're too cute to die!

122
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,798
Meow! Meow!

123
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,467
The Straw Hat Pirates threatened
to do all kinds of rude

124
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,671
and immoral stuff if I didn't
operate the train for them!

125
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,105
Those meanies!

126
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,074
Meow! Meow!

127
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,681
Who would let their
hostages get drunk?

128
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,615
That was close!

129
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,717
We almost blew up
that innocent old lady!

130
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,519
What kind of deranged
monster would take

131
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,355
a senior citizen, a little girl,
and a cat as hostages?

132
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,192
Is it just me, or is that
smoke forming a cloud?

133
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,228
Using cool balls.

134
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,064
And heat balls.

135
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:53,267
I can turn the moisture
in the air into clouds.

136
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,202
Aww, there you are Nami-sweet!

137
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,404
I knew you'd make it out okay!

138
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,909
Hey.

139
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,211
Something weird's going on
with that smoke cloud thing.

140
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,147
Look! Look!
The cloud's growing, Granny!

141
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,449
Meow, meow!

142
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,252
It's starting to look
dangerous if you ask me.

143
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,553
C'mon.

144
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,254
Let's go.

145
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,360
He didn't name it the "Perfect
Clima Takt" for nothing!

146
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,329
These clouds are growing a lot
bigger and faster than before!

147
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,365
The question is, how
strong are the thunderbolts?

148
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,068
Let's find out.

149
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,204
This is looking scary, guys.

150
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,740
It's prob'ly
better to run, right?

151
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,174
I hope you're ready.

152
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,146
'Cause here comes the
new Thunderbolt Tempo!

153
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:01,101
Look! Look!
You can see their skeletons!

154
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,469
Meow!

155
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,407
I tell ya!

156
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,775
That girl is something else!

157
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:08,576
Hey.

158
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,311
Is this umbrella
gonna protect us?

159
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,111
Sure.

160
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,078
We haven't been struck

161
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,115
by any of them lightning
bolts yet, have we?

162
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,395
You trying to kill me or what?

163
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,064
Ah!

164
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:33,100
Nami, why'd you hit Sniper King?

165
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,034
I don't know.

166
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,135
I felt like it?

167
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,537
Don't take it out on me!

168
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,173
It's not my fault you
don't know how to use it yet!

169
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:43,444
Besides, Usopp told me he
never added a feature like that!

170
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,112
Either way.

171
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,181
That thing is crazy powerful!

172
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,381
You beat everyone!

173
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,053
Ah.

174
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:53,754
Damn it, Nami!

175
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:54,454
What the hell?

176
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,290
Watch where you aim that thing!

177
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,192
Apologize to him, Sniper King!

178
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,194
You apologize, stupid!

179
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,428
I haven't felt a shock like that

180
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,598
since the first time
I met you, Nami-swan.

181
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,767
Those pirates
are out of control.

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,734
It's crazy!

183
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,637
I thought that girl
was just the navigator,

184
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,373
but it turns out she's as
strong as the rest of 'em!

185
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,608
Seems like the storm is passed.

186
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,410
That was awesome, pirate lady!

187
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,345
Meow, meow!

188
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,115
Hey, glad to see you guys
made it out alive, Granny!

189
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:25,318
Ain't no coincidence
I've lived as long as I have!

190
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,392
So anyway, what
about our Captain?

191
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,294
Any guesses on where he went?

192
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:34,128
Who knows.

193
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,496
The island's pretty big.

194
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,664
Where should we start?

195
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,801
Huh?

196
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,137
That's got to be where he's at.

197
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,107
All right, then.

198
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,142
Let's get moving.

199
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,750
You filthy criminals think

200
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,787
the Watchdogs'll let
you do as you please?

201
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,488
Not a chance!

202
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:39,259
Now, Gum-Gum Spear!

203
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,665
He jumped onto the tree!

204
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:48,736
I'm not getting anywhere.

205
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,739
Don't those dumb jerks
have anything better to do?

206
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,674
This way! Quick!

207
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,210
They're running the other way?

208
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,779
Half of you, head to the
main island front gate!

209
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,482
Pirates forced it open
and are invading the island!

210
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,384
Stop them at any cost!

211
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,785
All right, now that
everyone else's here

212
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:07,354
I can finally stop
running from these guys!

213
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:09,690
Got him!

214
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:10,357
Sorry!

215
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,392
Try again!

216
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,393
He's over there!

217
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,560
Fire!

218
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,531
I think we should take a right.

219
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,400
In that case,
we'd better turn left.

220
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,534
You wanna fight about it?

221
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,336
Guys, chill, we're
just going straight.

222
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,509
If our idiot captain hadn't
rushed ahead on his own,

223
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,811
we wouldn't be having this
little problem right now.

224
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,714
Well, we're the ones
following that idiot around

225
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,583
so what does that make us?

226
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,685
Then again, thanks to Luffy,
the Marine forces

227
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:40,087
are scattered
all over the island.

228
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,556
All we have to do now is head
straight for the courthouse!

229
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,825
Oh no, my chronic
illness is back!

230
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,694
Then stay here
and die on your own.

231
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:47,428
I'm cured!

232
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,029
That's better.

233
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:54,235
Hey.

234
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:55,602
Is something wrong?

235
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,173
Looks like we've got guests.

236
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,488
We are the Watchdogs, guards
of the island's front gate!

237
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:18,325
You've run rampant for
far too long, villains!

238
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,428
No criminal shall
cross this line!

239
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,432
What's wrong?

240
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,534
You guys can't afford horses?

241
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:31,037
Look around before you
mock us, pirate scum.

242
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,523
Yep, I'd say they've
got us surrounded all right.

243
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,427
Were they following
us all this time?

244
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,529
It's too late to run away now.

245
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,198
You're finished!

246
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,167
Yeah?

247
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,635
We'll see.

248
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,704
You cocky little scoundrel!

249
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,539
All right men, let's a--

250
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:14,815
Grab on!

251
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,216
Here!

252
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,568
Thanks.

253
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,470
Coulda let us have
some fun first, though.

254
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,072
You idiot!

255
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,241
Don't forget the reason
you came here!

256
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,076
Save your energy
for the real fight!

257
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,344
You're right.

258
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:48,014
We'd be here all day
with that many guys.

259
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,821
Those kiddos are full of energy!

260
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,823
Don't die out there!

261
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,558
Go save your friend!

262
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,593
Meow, meow!

263
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,463
Everybody!

264
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,198
Get back!

265
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,300
It's a King Bull from Water 7!

266
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,268
Ready the cannons!

267
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,073
You guys ready?

268
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,374
Fire!

269
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,581
Franky Family coming through!

270
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:27,254
Watchdogs, back in
formation immediately!

271
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,388
Roger!

272
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:31,158
You can run away if you
like, but our dogs aren't going

273
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,695
to lose to a couple
of overgrown fish!

274
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:35,496
Uh-oh!

275
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,431
They're gonna jump
up on the bull!

276
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:37,998
What?

277
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,633
Can't we go any faster?

278
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,002
Hey, Cook.

279
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,605
What's up?

280
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,107
You take the reins.

281
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,341
Here.

282
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:50,611
Wait.

283
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:55,148
What's going on here?

284
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:13,567
When you see 'em, I want you
to pass on a message for me.

285
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,570
"You're all fired."

286
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,306
You got it.

287
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,208
All right, jump!

288
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,544
Not so fast!

289
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,647
Good luck, Galley-La, we're
leaving this one to you!

290
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,582
We're gonna skewer you!

291
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:33,620
Half Knot Air Drive!

292
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,761
Whoa!

293
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,529
He took out those
Watchdogs out in one hit!

294
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,229
Fools!

295
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,665
They just let their guard down!

296
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:47,101
No mere human
can match our speed!

297
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,670
Give them a taste
of canine power, men!

298
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:50,671
Go!

299
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,572
They won't know what hit 'em!

300
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:55,108
Strike 'like lightning!

301
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,316
Not them too!

302
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:06,786
Who are these guys?

303
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:13,760
That was so cool!

304
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,670
You ready for round two?

305
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,277
Take this!

306
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:41,722
It seems your temperament is as
volatile as ever, Cutty Flam.

307
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:44,224
Even though we haven't
seen each other in years,

308
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:47,094
it turns out that you've caused
me quite a bit of trouble;

309
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,230
faking your death and hiding
the blueprints, I mean.

310
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,331
It's ironic.

311
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,735
I could've arrested you had
I known you were alive.

312
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:58,172
Your old charges never
were cleared were they?

313
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,408
Speaking of thorns in my side,
your old friend Iceberg

314
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,744
has given me quite
the hassle as well.

315
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,479
Bringing together
all the ship builders

316
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,681
in Water 7 was quite crafty.

317
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,516
The resulting
Galley-La Company turned

318
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,319
into a force to
be reckoned with.

319
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,188
Though he must've
resented the government,

320
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,757
he allied with us all the same.

321
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,293
And before we knew it,
we were reliant on

322
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,563
his company to provide
ships for the entire Navy.

323
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:26,066
Not only was he the president
of the Galley-La Company.

324
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,670
He was also the
mayor of Water Seven.

325
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,406
In other words, he was
popular with the public

326
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:35,276
and indispensable
to the government.

327
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,411
If we dealt with him carelessly,

328
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,648
there could've been
severe repercussions.

329
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,483
I've heard that your
company has been contracted

330
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,551
to build ships for the
World Government!

331
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,520
I won't tolerate
you helping them!

332
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,189
How could you, after
what they did to Tom?

333
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:53,327
So that's why he made a
deal with those bastards.

334
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,196
I admit, he's a very clever man!

335
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,064
Or was.

336
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,069
I had almost lost my patience.

337
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,405
If the wind hadn't blown
in my favor when it did,

338
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:08,042
I was ready to resort
to extreme measures.

339
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:11,445
Then, Admiral Aokiji sent
some good news my way.

340
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:15,449
He said that our little friend
Nico Robin was on a pirate ship,

341
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:18,118
headed to
Water Seven for repairs.

342
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,687
Of course, I had to calm down

343
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,389
and think about it
over a cup of coffee.

344
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,459
But fortunately, with the
Buster Call at my disposal,

345
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,228
it was quite easy
to formulate a plan.

346
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,229
Little did I know,

347
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:32,399
the result would exceed
my wildest expectations.

348
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,634
Look!

349
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,835
Both of the triggers needed

350
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:39,306
to revive the Ancient Weapon
are right here at my mercy!

351
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:43,343
You get it, now?

352
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,213
When I say the winds of this
world are blowing in my favor,

353
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,515
I most assuredly mean it!

354
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,559
Every man and every nation in
the world must answer to me!

355
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,062
All that power at
the tip of my fingers!

356
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,797
I don't understand.

357
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:07,200
Why would Aokiji allow you
to invoke the Buster Call?

358
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:33,093
What gives you the
right to question me?

359
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,095
You shut your mouth!

360
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,666
You get to play a part in
the rebirth of this world!

361
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:42,369
Isn't that enough for you,
you insolent witch?

362
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,707
Why, you should
even be thanking me!

363
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,608
Yeah? Huh?

364
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:52,279
I'll cleanse this
world of Ohara's legacy

365
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,548
by bleeding you dry.

366
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,349
Nico Robin.

367
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:14,428
Stop!

368
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,796
That wasn't the agreement!

369
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,399
Come now, what're you
getting so worked up about?

370
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,501
You promised the Straw Hats
would be allowed

371
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:21,635
to leave Water 7 safely!

372
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,702
Correct.

373
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,706
After allowing them to
leave safely, as promised,

374
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,175
the Straw Hats
decided to come here.

375
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,243
Bastard!

376
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,411
On the next One Piece:

377
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:34,048
"Robin Betrayed! The Motive
of the World Government."

378
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,182
I'm going to be
king of the pirates!
