1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,041
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,258
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,178
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:52,519
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,048
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:26,845
[NARRATOR] In the ruins
surrounding Giant Jack

25
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:30,181
spirit and sword clashed as
battle lines were crossed,

26
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,891
and lives hung in the balance.

27
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:33,059
[OHM]
Eisen Whip!

28
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,353
[gasps]

29
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,646
Axe Dial!

30
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,772
[groans]

31
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,194
[NARRATOR] As this fierce
battle for survival raged on,

32
00:02:43,278 --> 00:02:45,989
the persistent Shandorian
Warrior Laki fell

33
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:49,325
at the lightning rod
hands of God Eneru.

34
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,834
Laki!

35
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,586
[NARRATOR] After being swallowed
by the giant snake,

36
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,047
Nami, Gan Fall and Aisa
met someone they

37
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,092
never expected they would meet
in the serpent's stomach.

38
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:11,598
[LUFFY]
"Bursting Slash! Zoro vs. Ohm!"

39
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,108
[roars]

40
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,446
[ZORO] The first thing
I'm gonna have to do is

41
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,948
take care of that snake!

42
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:33,953
[WYPER]
Did it work?

43
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,955
[roaring]

44
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:39,751
[WYPER] Not enough.
I guess I'll just keep trying!

45
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:42,837
[WYPER growls]

46
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,506
[roaring]

47
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:50,720
[ZORO panting]

48
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,597
[ZORO]
This is getting really old.

49
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,891
That extendable sword
he's using is a pain.

50
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,393
And that snake...

51
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:58,228
I already know defeating him
first isn't exactly gonna be

52
00:03:58,311 --> 00:03:59,396
a walk in the park.

53
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,022
But I have to get Nami
and the old Knight

54
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,941
out of that thing's
gut right now.

55
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,151
There's still time. Since
they were swallowed whole,

56
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,237
I would bet they're
not dead yet.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,405
[SNAKE roaring]

58
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:11,157
[ZORO] But it won't be
that way for long.

59
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,993
[OHM]
Eisen Whip!

60
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,537
Not again!

61
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:22,836
[ZORO grunts]

62
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,387
That bastard. Where is he?

63
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,305
[OHM]
Eisen Whip!

64
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:42,147
It's impossible to escape
from my attacks.

65
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,608
Just as there's no one who
can escape the reality of death.

66
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:48,028
It would be futile to try.

67
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,947
Those who don't accept
that are foolish.

68
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:54,159
You're pathetic.

69
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:56,286
It's useless to
try to defeat me.

70
00:04:56,369 --> 00:05:00,749
You don't even have enough sense
to realize you're about to die.

71
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,585
You're so focused on
the gold you seek

72
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,004
that you cannot see
anything else.

73
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:09,841
Not even the inevitable fate
that lies before you.

74
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,551
How sad.

75
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:22,979
[ZORO] All right. He's gotta
be around here somewhere.

76
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,440
Where's he attacking from next?

77
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,525
[OHM]
Eisen Whip!

78
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,777
[ZORO grunts]

79
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,823
What's goin' on here?

80
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,368
How come he always knows
exactly where I am?

81
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,913
It's as if he could see me
from behind that wall.

82
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,331
Who is this mad man?

83
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:44,459
And what's up with
those glasses?

84
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:48,588
[DIVINE H bleating]
Now prepare to die!

85
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:49,673
[yelling]

86
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:51,800
This has nothing to do with you.

87
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:53,718
[DIVINE H groans]

88
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,766
[OHM]
Another voice has disappeared.

89
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,353
There are only a few survivors
in the Upper Ruins now.

90
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,646
Just five people,

91
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,107
and two animals, remain.

92
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,442
No...

93
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,027
I'm wrong.

94
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,863
[OHM]
Eisen Whip!

95
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,615
You're dead!

96
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,659
Make that four people.

97
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:21,204
[SHANDORIAN A groaning]

98
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,375

[ZORO grunting]

103
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:33,675
[ZORO]
An iron wall...?

104
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:36,845
[OHM]
This sword is an iron cloud.

105
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:44,102
[OHM] You didn't think clouds
had a set shape did you?

106
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:45,895
You!

107
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,481
Eisen Fan!

108
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,734

[ZORO yelps]

110
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,404
Eisen Rapier! Ha!

111
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,406
[groans]

112
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:03,288
[ZORO]
He's predicting my movements.

113
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,582
Why can't I avoid it?

114
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,042
What's the matter?

115
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,461
Keeping your distance
doesn't do you any good

116
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,254
when you depend on your sword.

117
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,173
[ZORO]
You're wrong about that.

118
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:14,758
Huh?

119
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:16,176
[growls]

120
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:22,098

Eisen Whip!

122
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:29,564
[ZORO]
How could he block it?

123
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,610
[OHM grunts]

124
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:39,532

[ZORO]
Dammit!

127
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,541
[OHM] That's quite an
interesting technique

128
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,169
you've developed,
Blue Sea Dweller.

[ZORO panting]

130
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,219
[OHM] I wonder if
you'll try that again.

131
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,930
Unfortunately, even if
you lose sight of me,

132
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,015
I'll always know
where you are...

133
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,142
[ZORO panting]

134
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,396
...by using Mantora.

135
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:28,164
[HOLY growls]

136
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:36,047
Is that supposed
to intimidate me?

137
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:38,925
I'm a Shandorian warrior!

138
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,428

[HOLY grunting]

142
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,815
[OHM] Looks like we just
lost another one.

143
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:57,569
Now there are two animals
and three people left.

144
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:07,746
[OHM] But soon there
will be two animals

145
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,291
and only two people.

146
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:15,045
[SNAKE roars]

147
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:20,425
[OHM] So you're the leader of
the Blue Sea People up here.

148
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:25,138
You and your comrades
all put up a good fight.

149
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:29,642
However, my sword is now
pointed directly at your heart.

150
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:35,607
[OHM]
Say your prayers, swordsman!

151
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,610
[ZORO]
Don't be an idiot.

152
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:41,071
I never pray for anything.

153
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:42,405
[OHM]
That's too bad.

154
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,199
What sets people apart
from one another

155
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:47,369
is their ability to survive.

156
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,162
You should use your resources.

157
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:53,166
I'm through listening
to your arrogant lectures!

158
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:54,584
I don't have to see you.

159
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:56,628
I can follow that
extendable sword of yours

160
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:59,005
and know exactly where you are!

161
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,801
[OHM] Hmph. Well, the moment
you find me, you die!

162
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:06,638
One life holds 36
worldly desires.

163
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,683
[ZORO]
Two lives hold 72.

164
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:13,520
Three lives hold
108 worldly desires.

Three swords...

[LUFFY grunting]

181
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:46,488
Okay. This Mystery Cave is
getting really annoying.

182
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,990
[NAMI grunts]
I told you this isn't a cave.

183
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:50,367
We're in the snake's stomach!

184
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,951
Where are you?

185
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,662
Ahh! Nami!

186
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:58,249
Nami are you okay?!
Talk to me! Nami!

187
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,417
[LUFFY grunts]

188
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,795
I'm right here, you idiot.

189
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,630
[gasps] Let me go please!

190
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:06,341
You're gonna squeeze
me to death!

191
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:09,969
[GAN FALL] I'm glad to see
you're unharmed.

192
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,262
Let go!

193
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:12,722
Ah!

194
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,100
[gasps]

195
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,060
[NAMI] What are you
doing Aisa? Stop it!

196
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,311
He is our enemy!

197
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,647
He's responsible for
ruthlessly taking away

198
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,190
the Shandorian's homeland!

199
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:25,568
So now... I'm gonna
take his head.

200
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:29,155
I don't get it.

201
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:33,493
How is taking the head of the
Sky Knight gonna fix anything?

202
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,203
[AISA]
He's not just a knight.

203
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:36,830
He was the leader
of the Skypieans

204
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,164
before Eneru showed up!

205
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:39,499
The Skypieans were the ones

206
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:42,043
who drove all of us Shandorians
out of our homes!

207
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:45,380
The Shandorians were driven out
of their homes 400 years ago.

208
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,966
So there's no way he had
anything to do with it.

209
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,428
[GAN FALL] If taking my head
would satisfy your people,

210
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:54,014
I would gladly sacrifice it.

211
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:56,141
[gasps]

212
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:01,438
[GAN FALL] Unfortunately, just
my head wouldn't be enough.

213
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:04,315
The level of hostility between
the Shandorians and

214
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,986
the Skypieans hasn't changed,
and with good reason.

215
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:11,031
Our ancestors took
your homeland away.

216
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,491
What a horrifying thing
to go through.

217
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,702
I don't think I'll ever
be able to find a way

218
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:18,371
to apologize for that.

219
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,249
Time alone will not
heal this wound,

220
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:25,211
therefore I regret my
helplessness in this situation.

221
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:28,131
If at all possible,
I would like to apologize

222
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:30,008
to the Shandorians
who have spent

223
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:34,554
the last 400 years
searching for their homes.

224
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:39,976
I would like to apologize
to them all, one by one.

225
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:46,441
I am truly sorry.

226
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,026
Listen to him.

227
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,487
He's been trying to make sure
that everyone's getting along.

228
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,448
He wants the citizens to
live peacefully in the sky.

229
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,908
So you really shouldn't--

230
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:57,410
We will never be able to get
along and live peacefully!

231
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,537
Not with the bad guys!

232
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,164
That's just it, they're not bad.

233
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,416
What's bad is when
people can't coexist

234
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,503
because they belong
to different races!

235
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,213
Right?

236
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,147
[yells]

237
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,148
Aisa!

238
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:28,608

00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,110

241
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,413
Why did you stop me?

242
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,622
Idiot!

243
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:44,249
[LUFFY]
He was apologizing.

244
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,835
Probably not the best
time to kill a man.

245
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,671
[whimpering]

246
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:52,632
[AISA cries]

247
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:03,435
[ROBIN]
Shandora. The City of Gold.

248
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,478
And if the golden bell
said to be in the middle

249
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:09,024
of the city isn't here,
where is it?

250
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:12,777
The belfry was probably
engraved with poneglyphs.

251
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,657
[ROBIN] If that's the case,
then the city probably fell

252
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:20,035
in order to protect them.

253
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,414
[ROBIN]
Even after all this time,

254
00:15:24,497 --> 00:15:28,043
the belfry and the poneglyphs
should still be here.

255
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,590
They're hidden somewhere.

256
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,926
Hey, what's that?

257
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,637
A rail used to run
through this city.

258
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,059
[ROBIN]
But this is new.

259
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,311
Something was moved out of here.

260
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:48,438
I wonder what it was.

261
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:52,609
[ENERU laughs]
Isn't it amazing?

262
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,071
Even after being shot up into
the sky, the city of Shandora

263
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:59,157
still majestically
exists in this way.

264
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,995
[ENERU laughs] Even if it's a
city that everyone knows about,

265
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,872
how can it show off
its lovely figure

266
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,708
if it's covered by clouds?

267
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,837
[ENERU] I'm the only one
who could see it.

268
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,550
I discovered it. The former
Gods never even noticed.

269
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:20,220
And who are you?

270
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,180
I'm God.

271
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,769
[ENERU]
You're quite intelligent.

272
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,480
One might guess that you're an
archeologist from the Blue Sea

273
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:33,608
world by how fast you
found this city of ruins.

274
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,736
It took us several months
to find the same thing.

275
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,947
I suppose it's easier if
you can read the letters

276
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,282
on the ruins, right?

277
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,414
Unfortunately, the gold you're
looking for isn't here anymore.

278
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:50,041
I'm afraid you're a few
years too late for that.

279
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,418
The gold?

280
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,670
Well, you're right about that.
I couldn't find any.

281
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,506
You must've been
the one who removed it.

282
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,717
[ENERU] Gold is a wonderful
thing to have and

283
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,013
that glittering metal suits
me well, don't you think?

284
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,223
[ROBIN] Then you must also
have taken the golden bell

285
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,307
that was once here.

286
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,810
[ENERU]
Hm? There was a golden bell?

287
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:11,730
[ROBIN gasps]
He doesn't know!

288
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,656
Well I'm very intrigued.

289
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,493
What did you learn by reading
those letters on the bell?

290
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,496
[ROBIN] Actually, it's too bad,
I never got to read them.

291
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,293
If you say it wasn't here when
you arrived, it must not exist.

292
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,962
I guess the huge golden
bell and belfry that were

293
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,090
the pride of Shandora must have
only been another legend.

294
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:43,511
It's a shame that I'll never be
able to lay my eyes on them.

295
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,679
No, wait.

296
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,223
It's... It's actually
right here.

297
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,267
It's here in the sky!

298
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,562
When this island was blown
into the sky 400 years ago

299
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:55,398
and the Upper Yard was born--

300
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,734
Or, when "Godland" was born,

301
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,944
it was said that the
loud chimes of a bell

302
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:03,073
could be heard ringing
throughout the entire nation.

303
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:06,576
[bell tolls]

304
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,798
[ENERU] The elder
inhabitants of this land

305
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,384
called it the island's
singing voice.

306
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,968
But that wasn't it.

307
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,428
It was the bell!

308
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,514
The bell made of gold!

309
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,516
Amazing!

310
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,143
Soon the entire game
will be over.

311
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,104
Only eight minutes left.

312
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:35,939
That's not long at all. In fact,

313
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,776
it gives me plenty of time
to look for the golden bell.

314
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,239
[ENERU chuckles]

315
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:46,866
[ROBIN] So the golden
bell is in the sky?

316
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,202
Which means the
poneglyphs are, too!

317

00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,122

It sounds like there's
a maggot on the island.

Hm. They're still unconscious?

They are, but I think
they'll wake up soon.

352
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,511
Conis, he needs
your help right away!

353
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,304
Yes, of course father!

354
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,473
[MAN A]
No wait!

355
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,558
My family's on Angel Island.

356
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,435
Please... Please help.

357
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,687
[PAGAYA]
I will.

358
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,522
I know everyone's worried
about all of you.

359
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:45,735
Let everyone know Eneru--he's
planning to return everything!

360
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,320
[PAGAYA]
What?

361
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:49,531
[MAN A] Skypiea will be dropped
back into the Blue Sea world,

362
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:52,617
and this entire nation
will no longer exist!

363
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:55,704
But that... can't be true!

364
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,581
[CONIS gasping]

365
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:01,418
There's no time to lose.
You must tell everyone.

366
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,586
Do it, now!

367
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,172
[MAN A]
Our lives will soon be over.

368
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:08,591
Eneru is planning to eliminate
every living person

369
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,593
from the sky!

370
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,348
Eliminate everyone from the sky?

371
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:18,685
But wait... If he succeeds
in that then...

372
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,520
...he won't have
a place to live.

373
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:23,106
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would he want to do that?

374
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:24,899
He built a ship.

375
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,901
The Ark Maxim.

376
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,654
[PAGAYA]
Ark Maxim...?

377
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:32,866
Hey, what are y--?

378
00:21:32,949 --> 00:21:34,576
[gasps]

379
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,459
We were forced to spend

380
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,170
the last six years of our lives
building that ship!

381
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,004
[CONIS yelps]

382
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,297
[gasping]

383
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:55,847
Father!

384
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,058
When the sky finally
becomes peaceful,

385
00:21:58,141 --> 00:22:01,186
I'd like to be able to show
everyone the hospitality

386
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:03,938
they once knew to
my heart's content.

387
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,899
Including you.

388
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,913
[CONIS]
Father!

389
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

390
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:33,510
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

391
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:37,514
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

392
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:41,101
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

393
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

394
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:48,900
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

395
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,986
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

396
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

397
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,245
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

398
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

399
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

400
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,544
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

401
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,462
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

402
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,215
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

403
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,633
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

404
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

405
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:19,347
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

406
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,182
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

407
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,020
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

408
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,189
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

409
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,747
[LUFFY]
Let's break out of here!

410
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,373
[ENERU]
It's almost time.

411
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:48,043
I will finally put an end
to this survival game.

412
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,420
[ZORO] Hold on! The ground!
It's breaking apart!

413
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,672
[WYPER] Is this the homeland
we've been fighting for?

414
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:54,382
For over 400 years?

415
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,676
[ENERU] Well, it looks like
we have another player.

416
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,802
[ZORO, WYPER, GAN FALL]
You will die!

417
00:23:57,886 --> 00:23:59,512
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

418
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:03,224
"Collapsing Upper Ruins!
The Quintet for the Finale!"

419
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,810
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
