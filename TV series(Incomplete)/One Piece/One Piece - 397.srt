[ROSWALD] You insist on
defying us to the very end!

186
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,624
Why can't you just
accept your fate?

be there by now?

We're on Grove 1 now. Hold on.

the swordsman, the
exhibitionist, and the reindeer

198

have all arrived.

199

Huh? If they're all there,

200
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,828
then that just leaves
Robin and Brook and me!

201
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,997
Oh, the mighty Usopp can't
be the last to arrive!

Hurry up!

What're you doing?

driving shook me off!

00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,924
Thanks.

All this money?

[RAYLEIGH] I think I can
find a more productive use

228
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,068
for it than trading
in someone's misery.

Look at the entrance.
It's completely blocked.

and kill these pirates!

nothing to fear, friends!

289
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:28,410
The mighty Usopp has
arrived to save the day!

290
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,079
And you thought all was lost!

Well calm your timid hearts.

You know the hero always
arrives at the very last minute.

293
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,920
I am the headlining
act after all.

294

[USOPP gasps]
So high!

295
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,927
Maybe I should
just stand up here

296
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,929
and bravely pose a while longer.

297
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,097
[FISH RIDER 387A]
Get going already!

298
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,298
[USOPP screams]

299
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:53,335
Thanks for screwing up the
timing of my dramatic entrance!

300
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,438
These cretins will suffer
my wrath! I'll stuff the women

301
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:00,275
as trophies and starve the
men through a life of slavery!

00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,947
[SHALRIA shrieks]
You crushed Father!

304
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,952
Wait. That didn't
hurt that much.

00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:13,355
[USOPP shrieks]
I'm so sorry, mister!

down Saint Roswald too!

00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,393

are coming. Don't you?

[KNIGHT groans]

309
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:22,231
Usopp! Brook! Robin!

310
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,366
Hey, you guys
made it. About time.

311
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,968
Luffy! Where's Camie?

312
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,803
Right there! The thing is.

313
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:30,305
We gotta get that collar
off her before we can go!

314
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:31,240
We'd better hurry!

315
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,475
The navy is gonna
show up any minute now!

[USOPP screams]

317
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,845
[LAW]
I hate to tell ya this.

318
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,982
But the navy's already
here, Straw Hat.

319
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,318
Who the hell are you?
And what's with the bear?

320
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,354
[BEPO]
Bepo.

321
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,990
[LAW] You picked a
bad time to revolt.

322
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,059
The navy's had this place
surrounded since before

323
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,895
the auction even began.
They've got a base

324
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:57,199
on the archipelago, but I'm
guessing they're after someone.

325
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:00,035
[MARINE 397A] Please leave
in a calm and orderly fashion!

326
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,504
It's alright, we have
everything under control!

327
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,739
[MARINE 397B]
How's it look inside?

328
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,607
[MARINE 397C] We've finished
evacuating all of the patrons,

329
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:08,177
but the three Celestial Dragons
are still inside.

330
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:09,912
[MARINE 397B]
Then get them out of there!

331
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:15,050
Damn pirates! You're not
gettin' out of this alive!

332
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,952
[LAW] I don't know who
exactly they were hoping

333
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:21,023
to catch in here. But, I
sincerely doubt they were

334
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:25,094
expecting someone to go and
kick a Celestial Dragon's ass.

335
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,431
[LAW chuckles] That was a
hell of a show you guys put on.

336
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,300
I'm impressed, Straw Hat.

337
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,936
Ah. You're Trafalgar Law.

338
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,371
Luffy. They're pirates
just like us.

339
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,475
Huh? Even the bear?

340
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,043
[BEPO grunts]

341
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,612
[USOPP, BROOK whimpering]

342
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,082
Oh, and the guy
standing in back?

343
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,617
[ROBIN]
That's Eustass "Captain" Kid.

344
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,886
[BROOK gasps]
You mean the one who has

345
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,921
a higher bounty than Luffy?

346
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,451

348
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,560
Enough of this.

349
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,463
If this worthless fish drove
them to such extremes.

350
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,532
I have no choice but to kill it.

351
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,634
[DISCO gasps]
She's not worthless!

352
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,468
Please! Don't!

353
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,804
I beg you to stop,
Saint Shalria!

354
00:18:16,837 --> 00:18:18,972
Could you maybe at least
wait until the merchandise

355
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:21,508
has been paid for? I beg of you!

356
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,076
Please stop! Have mercy!

357
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,478
I just wanna be rich!

358
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,413
[SHALRIA]
Enough, commoner! Silence!

361
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:32,753
Alright, fish. It's
time for you to pay.

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,655
[SANJI] Oh, crap! Camie!

[RAYLEIGH]
What'd I tell you?

376
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,977
[RAYLEIGH] I know a
ruckus when I hear one.

377
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,779
Looks like the auction's over.

378
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:09,816
I got the money I came here for.
Now guess I'll head back

379
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,452
to the gambling house
and throw it all away.

380
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:14,521
[GIANT 394A]
You are one messed up old man.

381
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,658
You got locked up just
to steal some money?

382
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:20,027
That was the plan.
And if it had worked out,

383
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,596
I was gonna rob
whoever bought me, too.

384
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,132
Ha. But I guess it
wasn't meant to be.

385
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,534
Oh, right, I forgot I'm out.

386
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,469
Time to find some more booze.

387
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:30,537
Now that I think about it.

388
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,940
That plan stinks. Who the
hell would spend money

389
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,542
on an old fart
like me for a slave?

[RAYLEIGH laughing]

391
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:46,653
Huh? Oh, boy.

392
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,122
I didn't realize we had
such a captive audience.

[BLACK KNIGHT 397E]
Where did that old man

394
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,125
and the giant come from?

00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,961
[AUCTION HOUSE MAN 397B] They
were supposed to be merchandise

396
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,662
for the auction but
they were locked up.

397
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:57,798
How in the heck did
they get out of there?

398

[AUCTION HOUSE MAN 397B yells]
Their collars are gone!

could've gotten them off!

[BLACK KNIGHT 397F]
How should I know?

402
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,342
It's not our job
to capture slaves.

403
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,746
And we've got no chance going
up against an unshackled giant.

407
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,086
Which one is he?

Hey! Is that you, Hachi?

It sure is!
I'll be damned!

00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,994
So, pal. What are
you doing here?

411
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,162
Did someone hurt you?

speak, save your energy.

415
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:09,036
I see now. Plain as day.

00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,272
A terrible situation.

417
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:16,610
Well, you were fighting for what
you believe is right, Hachi.

418
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:20,881
[RAYLEIGH] You must be the
good folks who stood by him.

No way.

What? But how?

00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,803
What'd you do to them?

00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:45,639
Okay. Who is this guy?

[RAYLEIGH]
That straw hat you wear?

426
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:58,085
It suits a fearless man
like yourself quite well.

Yes. I've wanted to meet you.

And so close to the Holy Land!

Hasn't he given
us enough trouble?

432
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,776
[KIZARU] Yes, about that.
The World Nobles are the victims

433
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,011
this time, so we'd better
make a good show of things.

[SENGOKU]

You take it nice and easy.
