Is it a code?

Well, it's not a tattoo, right?

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,418
Hey, Grandpa,

347
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,087
think something bad
happened to Mr. Frank?

348
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,890
I'm sorry, Kitton.
It's too late now.

349
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,726
Just forget the whole incident.

350
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,094
You'll be better off.

351
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:58,665
That explosion was massive.
There's no way he's still alive.

352
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:02,636
And I told him not to press that
self-destruct button repeatedly.

353
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,704
[gasps]

354
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,171
[gasps]

355
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,508
[BOTH gasping]

356
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,743
[FRANKY]
One, two, three!

357
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:10,644
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER,
KITTON yell]

358
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:13,580
[FRANKY]
Whoa, heh, that was a doozy!

359
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:16,583
[KITTON yells]
You're alive!

360
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,255
[FRANKY]
Huh... Uh-huh.

361
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:26,960
[KITTON giggles]

362
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:32,933
I gotcha, boss.

363
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:37,204
[BOTH screaming]

364
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,140
[NARRATOR]
The Tehna Gehna Kingdom.

365
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:46,346
[CROWD cheering]

366
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,185
I don't have time
to dawdle around

367
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,821
while my friends
are still out there.

368
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,522
--[LONGARM A] Hey!
--Huh?

369
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,691
Are you done eating yet?
Lemme have those plates.

370
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,259
[BROOK]
Oh, go ahead.

371
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,329
Also, I think I asked you
gentlemen for the newspaper.

372
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,864
There might be a follow-up story

373
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:05,733
about my friend
that I'd like to read.

374
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,701
Surely you understand?

375
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,869
Real funny!

376
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,771
You don't even have eyes
in that empty head of yours.

377
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:13,273
How the hell are
you supposed to read?

378
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,808
I may joke about my appearance,

379
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,810
but it's hurtful when
someone else does it!

380
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:20,381
Too bad, freak show!
You're up soon, so get ready.

381
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:21,514
Here.

382
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,185
[BROOK gasps]
It's Luffy!

383
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,988
Greetings! Feast your eyes,
ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,390
on these magnificent
living bones!

385
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:37,297
[CROWD cheers]

386
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,567
Ah, hah. How very clever of you!

387
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:47,107
No need to worry, Luffy.
I understand. [chuckles]

388
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:50,177
[NARRATOR]
The ruins of Muggy Kingdom.

389
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,146
[PERONA]
You gonna sleep there forever?

390
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:53,547
Would you get up!

391
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,981
Quit trying to leave!

392
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:57,651
Do you like getting stomped
by a bunch of baboons?

393
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,052
Look at it from my side.

394
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,721
I've got to take care of you!

395
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,156
Leave me alone, will ya?

396
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:04,191
[gasps] Very well!

397
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,626
I guess you don't need this!

398
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,561
I brought today's newspaper
from the News Coo

399
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,263
because I thought you
might wanna read it!

400
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,130
[ZORO grunts]

401
00:22:10,164 --> 00:22:11,365
[PERONA]
Aren't I considerate?

402
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,766
There's an update
on your captain, too,

403
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,335
but you don't care.

404
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,168
What?!

405
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,373
[ZORO groaning]

406
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:23,043
The paper! You have
to give it to me!

407
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,046
[PERONA yells]
Okay, okay!

408
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,880
You're freakin' me out!

409
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:29,817
[PERONA]
Hey, are you done yet?

410
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,518
My hands are getting tired!

411
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,220
[ZORO]
Hold on a sec!

412
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:35,555
There's something going on here.

413
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:38,491
Normally, Luffy wouldn't
do something like this.

414
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:42,196
Rayleigh's with him, so it
must be some idea he cooked up.

415
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:43,964
There's gotta be a catch here.

416
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,400
I don't care, just
hurry it up, will ya?

417
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:51,404
[ZORO grunting]

418
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,721
[ZORO groans]

419
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,430
[NARRATOR] Luffy's crew
receives his message.

420
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,566
Meanwhile, a battle to become
one of the Four Emperors

421
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,169
breaks out among pirates
now in the New World.

422
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,904
As the fighting intensifies,

423
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:27,240
a Navy admiral appears
to wipe out the pirates.

424
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:29,142
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

425
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,713
"Pirates Get on the Move!
Astounding New World!"

426
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:35,382
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
