00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.658
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.561
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:46.799
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.968
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.336
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.605
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.507
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.910
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.612
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.284
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.852
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.556
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.693
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.797
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.633
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.204
which is located ten thousand
meters below sea level.

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.371
The Fishman Pirates,

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:28.708
led by Hordy Jones and
assisted by Vander Decken,

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.245
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:34.080
It is not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:35.615
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.585
and find themselves in
the midst of an all-out war!

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.554
After a change of plans,
Hordy threatens to crush

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:45.158
the entire island under
the weight of a massive ship.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.028
I told you before.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.364
Didn't you hear me?

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:55.034
I'll save Shirahoshi
and this island.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.636
Oh, Luffy.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.706
Because I promised my friend.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.908
Straw Hat.

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.444
[LUFFY]
I'll protect them.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.079
Every last one!

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.716
Song of Scratches...
Blizzard Slice!

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.085
[USOPP]
Impact Wolf! Awesome, right?

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:15.421
Cloven Roseo Palm!

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.190
Franky...

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:19.325
Ika, Ika, Ika!

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.528
...Radical Beam!

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.498
And begone!

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.235
[SANJI]
Hell Memories!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.606
Purgatory... Onigiri!

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.911
Now, Gum-Gum... Elephant Gun!

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.446
Shut up!

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.283
I've heard enough of you!

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:46.753
Crush them, Noah.

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:52.825
Kill them all. They've forsaken
their pride as Fishmen.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:55.428
They deserve to pay the price.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:58.665
[HORDY chuckles]

00:04:58.698 --> 00:04:59.799
[HORDY gasps]

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.206
[yelling]

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.780
Now, Gum-Gum...
Elephant Gatling!

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:20.586
[LUFFY] "Stop, Noah!
Desperate Elephant Gatling!"

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.578
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Those officers were like demons

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.649
straight out of hell, but they
were a joke to the Straw Hats.

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:51.884
I'm glad they're on our side!

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.795
[USOPP]
He, he, he.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.899
Heh.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.683
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:25.518
[SANJI]
Heads up, fish people!

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.688
Eyes on the sky!
Danger's on the way down!

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.022
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.026
It's Wadatsumi!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.661
He'll squash us flat!

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:39.532
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.740
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:53.012
Coulda dropped him in a place
with less people, dumb-ass.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.180
Shut it!

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:57.083
Keep complaining and I'll
drop the next giant on you!

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:05.858
[CHOPPER] That was
downright amazing, Sanji.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.961
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.129
[FRANKY]
Hey, Chopper!

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.432
You mind shrinkin' down some?

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:15.101
You're totally upstaging
my giant robot here.

00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:18.137
[USOPP]
Franky! That beam was so cool!

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:22.074
Are you serious? That
robot was utterly useless.

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.812
[BROOK gasps]
That reminds me!

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:26.779
Nami!

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:28.681
What is it?

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.450
[BROOK] You should
really wear a miniskirt.

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.584
[NAMI]
Stuff it!

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:36.923
[ALL shouting]

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.226
Well done. Expected
no less from Luffy's crew.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:46.032
[FISHMEN murmuring]

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.642
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
He did it!

00:07:56.676 --> 00:07:59.278
[FISHMEN murmuring]

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.785
[AMMO KNIGHT A] It's for
real this time! I promise!

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.921
Luffy beat Hordy!

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:11.624
Did I hear that right?

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.758
Yeah.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:26.239
The Straw Hats did it. They
beat the New Fishman Pirates.

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.174
They saved us!

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:33.212
[GROUP cheering]

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.951
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Wait! Th-The Noah!

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:42.154
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.964
[FISHMAN AA]
The Noah's right above us!

00:08:51.998 --> 00:08:54.867
[ALL scream]

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:59.071
Run for your lives!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:00.139
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE E]
It's gonna crush

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.041
every last one of us!

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.543
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F]
We've gotta get out of here!

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.279
Neptune's army might trap
us in the plaza if we don't!

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.281
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G] We can
make it! Those psycho officers

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:11.117
can't stop us now!

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.688
It's chaos down there! How's the
evacuation proceeding so far?

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.323
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Only a handful of citizens

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:18.925
have escaped to the sea.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.159
The rest are trying to run,

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:23.262
but all sense of order has
been thrown out the window!

00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:28.301
[FISHMEN screaming]

00:09:29.168 --> 00:09:30.670
[MERMAID A grunts]

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:33.906
Are you okay?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.441
[gasps]

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.310
Oh, no, are we too late?

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.649
Please, do something!
Stop that thing!

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:46.719
Straw Hat!

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.391
The rebellion
has been vanquished,

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.160
but it was all for naught!

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.230
It's over!

00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.865
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
No! It's not!

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:00.933
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Hm?

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:08.541
Straw Hat is still fighting!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.646
He's not giving up yet!

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.151
[AMMO KNIGHT A] I can hardly
believe what I'm seeing.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.957
[yelling]

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.226
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
He still has strength left!

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.330
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
He's attacking the Noah!

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.934
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
It's breaking apart!

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:43.676
[yelling]

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.253
He's gonna smash it?

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:57.289
How can anyone
destroy a ship that huge?

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.326
Well, they can't!
Even if it is Luffy!

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.129
We might wanna
prepare for the worst.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:06.098
Perhaps, but let's
have faith in him.

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.236
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Oh, come on, you can do it!

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:15.608
[LUFFY yelling]

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.981
[yelling]

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.151
Careful, Luffy!

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:31.590
We'll be all right if he can
obliterate it before it crashes,

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.793
but if he's unable to...

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:36.429
...then we're all doomed.

00:11:36.462 --> 00:11:40.132
It'll be the end
for Fishman Island.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:43.169
Give it everything
you've got, Luffy!

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:47.540
[USOPP]
We're counting on you down here!

00:11:47.573 --> 00:11:50.409
[CHOPPER]
Luffy!

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.212
I believe in you.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:57.349
[FISHMEN screaming]

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:00.252
[STRIPED HAT FISHMAN]
What's wrong?

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.054
[SHELL SHIRT FISHMAN]
I refuse to run!

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:05.124
Are you insane?!
The Noah's right above us!

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:09.228
I know that! I'm not stupid,
but this reminds me...

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:12.832
It makes me think of another
pirate who fought to protect us.

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:17.002
It happened when I was
a kid... 20 years ago.

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.704
[STRIPED HAT FISHMAN gasps]

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.874
I even recall you being
there! You remember?

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.977
There was one other human
our kingdom revered.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.512
[gasps]

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.620
[PIRATE B laughs]
Helluva haul we got!

[MERMAID B panting]

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:36.655
[PIRATE A]
Get back here!

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.090
No!

00:12:38.124 --> 00:12:39.391
[PIRATE A groans]

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:44.029
What the hell? You in the
mood to die or somethin'?

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:46.432
[PIRATE CAPTAIN A gasps, yelps]

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:50.102
No way! What's he doing here?

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:53.139
And why is he siding
with the Fishmen?

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:56.842
[WHITEBEARD chuckles] Neptune
helped me out of a jam one time

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.377
back when we were young,

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.413
and we pledged friendship
over cups of saké.

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:05.785
Please don't kill me! I promise!

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:09.655
We'll never kidnap
mermaids or Fishmen again!

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.791
Ya wanna mess with
my friend's country,

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:16.262
then you face the consequences,
you snot-nosed punks!

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.165
[PIRATES yelling]

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.371
You listen up.

00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:28.574
This island is
under my protection!

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.647
[STRIPED HAT FISHMAN]
You're talking about Whitebeard?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.615
That guy was a living legend!

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:39.084
You trust the
Straw Hats that much?

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:40.419
Don't get me wrong.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:43.756
I... I don't even
like humans, honestly.

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:46.258
And this is our
kingdom, not theirs.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:48.093
But they...

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:51.730
[LUFFY] Our minds were made up
as soon as we got to the plaza.

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:55.968
With Jimbei's help, we
were gonna save this island!

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.904
Leave it to me and my crew!

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:01.841
That's what friends
are for, right?

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:05.711
The things that Straw Hat said--
and they're risking their lives.

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:10.749
[FISHMEN gasping]

We're rootin' for ya down here!
We know you can do it!

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.437
Keep it up, Straw Hat!

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.374
You may be a human, but
you've got all of our support!

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.910
We ain't runnin' nowhere!

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:14.546
Go, Straw Hat!
We all believe in you!

[FISHMEN shouting]

00:15:23.555 --> 00:15:26.992
Please save our country,
Straw Hat. Save us all!

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:29.328
[FISHMAN BB]
Tear it apart, Straw Hat!

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:32.031

We don't need that ship anymore!

Tear it to bits!

broke half of this thing!

[groaning]

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.196

[LUFFY]
Stay back!

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:39.898
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:42.234
You wanna help?
Stay back and watch!

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:46.238
All that matters now is me
tearing this damn thing apart!

00:16:50.275 --> 00:16:54.580

dumb ship! Stop falling!

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:15.868
[yelling]

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:20.539
I'm sorry that this
had to happen, Father.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.709
Destroying the Noah.

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.011
It's the only thing to be done.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.180
Straw Hat!

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.416
[NEPTUNE] We're losing
the Ship of Promise,

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:32.017
but what can be done?

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.653
My people's lives
are more important.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:36.622
Still, I'm sorry.

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:40.726
I'm sorry that I cannot
keep the promise, Joy Boy.

[yelling]

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:55.607

[LUFFY]
Who's there?

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:29.608
Enough, Luffy!
You can't do this!

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:33.378
You have to stop!
You're going to kill yourself!

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.950
Move, Weepyhoshi!
I have to save the island!

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:41.186
[cries]

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.855
It's all right now!

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.323
[LUFFY]
It's not all right!

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:46.158
Everyone's gonna die if I don't!

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:48.227
Will you just look?

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.162
The Noah's stopped!

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:59.371
[panting]

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:04.710
The Sea Kings? But why?

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:07.446
[crying]

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:11.650
You're angry! I don't
like it when you yell at me!

00:19:11.683 --> 00:19:15.154
Hey! We got bigger
problems to deal with!

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:18.924
[SHIRAHOSHI crying]

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.559
[SHIRAHOSHI]
I don't know what this means,

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:24.930
but I think it's a good thing.
They stopped it. Somehow.

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.965
The Noah's not falling!

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.572
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
What the hell is happening?

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:35.140
Are you seeing this?

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.609
Did the Sea Kings
seriously stop the Noah?

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:41.480
[panting]

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:43.782
[groans]

00:19:43.815 --> 00:19:44.917
Oh, Luffy!

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.486
You're losing so much
blood from that wound!

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.488
We need to get you to a doctor!

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:53.625
[panting]

00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:57.829
Yeah, well, it's okay. Really.

00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:02.334
Just as long as
the ship is stopped.

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:08.674
[LUFFY] I'm just glad
everyone is safe now.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.677
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy!

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:15.180
[PURPLE SEA KING]
He'll be all right.

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.118
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:27.659
I gotta admit, that there
is one hell of a human.

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:31.763
Yeah, to say the least.
He sure is strong, isn't he?

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:35.801
Even if we had been late,
the island would've been saved.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:39.638
At the cost of the Noah being
completely destroyed, of course.

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:42.641
[SHIRAHOSHI gasping]

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:45.277
Well, it's a good thing
we did make it then.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.679
I sure am glad that
Princess Shirahoshi

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:50.816
called out to us
like that. Just in time.

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.553
Huh? But I didn't
do anything at all.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.787
I was just sad!

00:20:55.821 --> 00:21:00.025
Not quite. Your will and the
will of the human echoed as one,

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:04.396
becoming a wish. A prayer to us.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:10.936
Your desire to save
your people was so strong.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:13.739
We all heard it loud and clear.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:17.009
You're not nearly as
helpless as you think!

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.894
The power of the Sea
Kings is yours as well.

00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:40.465
If you are in need,
then we shall heed your call.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.952
P-People of the kingdom.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:03.388
I'm not sure what
just happened here.

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:06.224
I'm not even sure
if I can describe it.

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:09.394
But whatever
it was, it happened!

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:14.199
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
The Noah... It's been stopped!

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:19.438
[AMMO KNIGHT A] And it's
damaged, but not destroyed.

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:25.610
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Fishman Island has been saved!

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:26.878
[FISHMEN cheering]

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:31.383
[FISHMAN PP]
I knew Straw Hat would save us!

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:32.818
[FISHMAN O]
He did it!

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.453
[MERMAID E]
It's finally over!

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.887
[FISHBOY B]
Yeah!

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.189
[FISHGIRL A, FISHBOY A,
FISHBOY B] Yay!

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.058
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Straw Hat!

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:41.660
What a relief!

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:44.262
[SHELL SHIRT FISHMAN,
STRIPED HAT FISHMAN laughing]

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:49.301
[STRAW HAT PIRATES laughing]

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:16.294
[NARRATOR] Hordy is
vanquished, the Noah is stopped,

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:18.263
and Fishman Island is saved.

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:21.833
Unfortunately, Luffy was
gravely injured in the process.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:24.403
Just as the Fishmen
reach toward the future,

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:25.971
a nagging memory of the past

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.939
could cost their
savior his life.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:31.243
With no time to spare,
a true friend steps forward

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:33.879
to tear down the walls
of the island's history.

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.414
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:37.883
"To the Future!
The Path to the Sun!"

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:40.619
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
