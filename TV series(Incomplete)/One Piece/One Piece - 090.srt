00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,501
[KUREHA]
I see.

177
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,137
Is that what you've
decided to do?

178
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,472
[DALTON]
No.

179
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,806
I realize that leaving here

180
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,843
isn't the way to make up
for past mistakes.

181
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,479
This country is rid of
it's corrupt monarchy.

182
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,013
It's citizens are
preparing to build

183
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,316
a new country
that's all their own.

184
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,218
And I think if I stayed here,

185
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,819
I could find a way
to help them build it

186
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,322
into the country
that it's meant to be.

187
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,090
Maybe that will help...

188
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,358
...by washing away
some of the guilt

189
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,994
that I've carried around
with me for so long.

190
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,029
Well, seems to me...

191
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,232
...that you certainly do
possess the strength of heart

192
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,068
to take care of this country.

193
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,338
Strength of heart is needed
to look after a country.

194
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,173
And it can be
difficult to come by,

195
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,207
but I once saw it from a girl

196
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,110
who was no more than
ten years old at the time.

197
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,779
[WAPOL groans]
The World Summit again.

198
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,181
What a useless event this is.

199
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,083
I'm tired of coming to
this thing every year.

200
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,352
[KUROMARIMO]
You're absolutely right, sir.

201
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,687
[DALTON]
I wonder how much longer

202
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,524
Drum Kingdom can
continue like this.

203
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,861
The rift between the monarchy
and the citizens keeps growing.

204
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,795
[PERSON A gasps]

205
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,398
[PERSON A]
Look! It's the king of Alabasta!

206
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,800
[PERSON C]
Cobra Nefertari!

207
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,905
A king who is known
throughout the world

208
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,307
for his benevolence and wisdom.

209
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,076
[KING A]
The revolutionist, Dragon‐‐

210
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,946
this man's beliefs
are very dangerous.

211
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,948
As world leaders,
we should be aware

212
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,217
of the threat he poses
to our countries.

213
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,085
In as little as
five or six years,

214
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,154
he will likely become
a prominent enemy

215
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,223
opposed to our interests.

216
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,424
[yawns]

217
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,993
Well, I don't know about the
rest of your dumb countries,

218
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,596
but mine's governed too well for
my citizens to be lead astray

219
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,898
by some revolutionist. [yawns]

220
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,301
Go ahead and capture him if
you want, but leave me out.

221
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,402
it's ridiculous.

222
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,469
[COBRA growls]
Fool!

223
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,405
You are a selfish fool!

224
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,073
Why do you think we've
all gathered here

225
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,308
at the World Summit?

226
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,344
‐‐[WAPOL growls]
‐‐Just act responsibly for once!

227
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,080
No one talks to me like that!

228
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,583
Well, that summit
was as unenjoyable

229
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,084
as all the rest of them.

230
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,587
Huh? That girl!

231
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,289
She's that idiot
Cobra's daughter.

232
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,025
[chuckles]

233
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,962
Oh, no! My hand
must have slipped!

234
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,996
What are you doing?!

235
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,264
‐‐Sorry! Ha, ha, ha!
‐‐[IGARAM] Princess Vivi!

236
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,532
Oh, excuse me.

237
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,868
If I'm not mistaken, you're the
princess of Alabasta Kingdom.

238
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,471
Wow! it must suck to have
such a pathetic father!

239
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,206
Damn it! What do you
think you're doing?!

240
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,641
[VIVI]
No, stop, Igaram.

241
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,210
I'm fine.

242
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,378
My apologies.

243
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,146
I didn't look where
I was going, sir.

244
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,182
‐‐[WAPOL grunts]
‐‐[IGARAM growls]

245
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,117
That is quite a child.

246
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,285
At a World Summit like this

247
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,120
where all of the most powerful
leaders are gathered,

248
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,188
tensions tend to run high.

249
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,457
The slightest argument
can trigger an all out war.

250
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,293
Knowing that, she refused
to make a scene.

251
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,163
[DALTON]
She's so young to be so wise.

252
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,965
[WAPOL]
What an annoying little brat!

253
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,301
Let's go, Dalton.

254
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,636
Forgive us.

255
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,573
[VIVI cries]

256
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,142
[VIVI]
It hurts!

257
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,912
You made me so proud today,
Princess Vivi.

258
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,350
[DALTON] That princess had
great strength of heart indeed.

259
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,419
And that hasn't changed.

260
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,322
She's remained strong
all these years.

261
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,992
[DALTON]
She would make anyone proud.

262
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,563
[DOCTOR A]
Dalton, please.

263
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,165
The desire to care
for our country

264
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,167
hasn't faded from
within us either.

265
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,669
Allow us to do something.

266
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,505
We want to help
build a new country.

267
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,779
[DALTON]
Hiriluk.

268
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,349
This country will be reborn
as you always wished it to be.

269
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,685
Just like your son, Chopper.

270
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,687
[VILLAGER A]
Dalton! You need to hear this.

271
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,622
‐‐[footsteps]
‐‐[VILLAGER A panting]

272
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,390
I just remembered
something important

273
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,425
that I forgot to tell you.

274
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,359
What is it?

275
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,261
Take a look at this.

276
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,530
[VILLAGER B]
It's him!

277
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,199
That's the Straw Hat pirate
who defeated Wapol.

278
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,367
We're sure of it!

279
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,370
You mean he has a 30‐million‐
Berry bounty on his head?

280
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,404
Are you certain?

281
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,539
Goodness.

282
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,642
They're quite a band of rouges,
aren't they. [chuckles]

283
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,143
Where'd you find this?

284
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
Well, uh,

285
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,113
I completely forgot to
report this to you, Dalton.

286
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,481
I'm very sorry.

287
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,250
I guess it all happened
about a week ago.

288
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,386
A man who seemed to be
a random traveler

289
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,456
showed up one day
over in Robelle Town.

290
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,759
Strangely, it was a day
without any snowfall.

291
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,328
[VILLAGER B] We have no idea
where on the island he landed.

292
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,564
[VILLAGER A]
Anyway, he told us something.

293
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,466
The man said he was
hunting down Blackbeard,

294
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,502
the pirate who recently attacked
our island with his men.

295
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,237
And then, once he realized

296
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,306
that Blackbeard had
already left, he said...

297
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,508
In that case,
I have one more question.

298
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,412
Has a pirate wearing a straw hat
come through this area recently?

299
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,646
[VILLAGER B]
We didn't know so

300
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,249
he showed us the
wanted poster and said...

301
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,420
[ACE] Well, if the guy I
described does show up...

302
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,621
If he does?

303
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,822
[ACE]
Deliver this message:

304
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:41,293
I will wait for him in Alabasta
for ten days and no more.

305
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,695
Don't forget.

306
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:48,434
[gasps] Hey! Hold on a sec!
You didn't tell us your name!

307
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,537
[ACE]
Oh, yes, I forgot about that.

308
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,273
The name's Ace, gentlemen.

309
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,641
If you tell the
Straw Hat pirate,

310
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,310
then he'll know who I am.

311
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,179
[ACE chuckles]

312
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,517
Hey! Catch that guy.

313
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,819
He ate and didn't pay his
tab at the restaurant.

314
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,622
[ACE] Just give him
the message, thanks!

315
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,658
[BOTH]
Huh...

316
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:17,396
[DALTON] So he'll be waiting
in Alabasta for ten days. Huh.

317
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,633
Hm? Excuse me, Doctor,
but is there something wrong?

318
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,067
You look puzzled.

319
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,068
Tell me something, Dalton.

320
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,838
Have you ever heard of
the man Gol D. Roger?

321
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,506
Gol D.?

322
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,375
Do you mean Gold Roger?

323
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,576
I guess.

324
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,078
Is that what he goes by now?

325
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,182
[KUREHA]
From the looks of this...

326
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,716
...the guy Chopper
left this island

327
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,652
and headed out to sea with...

328
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,321
...is no ordinary pirate.

329
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,157
The spirit of D...

330
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,725
It still lives.

331
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,696
Whaddya know.

[CHOPPER]
This is amazing, Luffy!

333
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,952
The sea seems to go on forever!

334
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,886
Yeah, it's huge!

335
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,621
And pirates are the

336
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,723
great adventures
on it all the time.

337
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,557
Incredible.

00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,860
Being a pirate
must be really great!

Whoa! What is that thing?

341
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,598
[LUFFY]
It's a seagull.

342
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,367
[NAMI] No way. There aren't
any seagulls that are that big.

343
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,871
Hey! Seagull!

344
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,805
[NAMI gasps]
It's coming!

345
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,474
[LUFFY] See, I was right!
It is a seagull.

346
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,909
That's really not
the point right now!

347
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,577
It's coming at us because
you called it...

348
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,646
Oh, yay! Adventure!

349
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,914
[screeches]

350
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,817
[NAMI yells]

351
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,920
[NAMI]
Hey, where'd Luffy go?

352
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,723
‐‐[LUFFY] Yahoo!
‐‐Huh?

353
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:51,657
You moron!

354
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,993
You're about to become
that bird's dinner!

355
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,961
[CHOPPER] Something horrible
has happened, you guys!

356
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,963
[yells] A bird's eaten Luffy!

357
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,565
This is no time
for playing cards!

358
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,000
We need to do something!
Luffy's in trouble!

359
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,902
Did Luffy ask for help?

360
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,003
[CHOPPER]
No...

361
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,938
[ZORO] Then there's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

362
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,806
Yeah, but...

363
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,777
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

364
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,811
[LUFFY laughs]

365
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,346
[LUFFY]
...Propeller!

366
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,015
Amazing.

367
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,351
[ALL yell]

368
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,953
[LUFFY grunts]

369
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,654
Hey, Sanji!

370
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,623
I got some meat for us. Look!

371
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,991
Why are you guys sleeping?

372
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,927
[USOPP, SANJI, ZORO]
We're not, you idiot!

373
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,028
You owe me for this, Luffy.

374
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,796
I had a really good hand!

375
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,831
Oh, yeah? Oops. [laughs]

376
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,099
Whoa, that's huge.

377
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,702
Does this mean we can start
having some decent meals now?

378
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,604
Can we eat it?

379
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,640
Hey, Chopper,
is something wrong?

380
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,342
Well...

381
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,376
...it's just...

382
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,711
...pirates really...

383
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,046
You guys really are...

384
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,647
...really incredible!

385
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,549
Why, yes we are!

386
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,384
Hey, listen up you guys!

387
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,986
We'll be landing
at Alabasta soon,

388
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,323
and this is no time to be joking
around like a pack of hyenas.

389
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,524
Come on.

390
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,660
[ALL]
Yes, ma'am.

391
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,462
[CHOPPER]
So what is Alabasta then?

392
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,497
[NAMI] It's the country
where Vivi's father rules.

393
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,700
[USOPP] Yeah, except there's
this guy named Crocodile

394
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,835
who's trying to take over
the country right now.

395
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,005
[SANJI] And Crocodile's one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

396
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,707
Who're those guys?

397
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,508
[NAMI] They're pirates
who are given authority

398
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,843
by the World Government.

399
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,979
[CHOPPER] The government
actually supports pirates?

400
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,714
[USOPP]
Yeah. Pretty weird, huh?

401
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,550
And the Seven Warlords
are incredibly powerful.

402
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,052
You see, they go around
defeating other pirates,

403
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,187
one by one.

404
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,156
And that's why the government
supports the Warlords.

405
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,025
The idea is to have the pirates

406
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,561
get rid of all
the other pirates.

407
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,765
I'm really looking forward to
meeting this Crocodile guy.

408
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,067
Crocodile is considered
a hero back home.

409
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,004
He helps get rid of the pirates
who attack Alabasta.

410
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,706
However, his good deeds only
appear good on the surface.

411
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,408
He is an evil man.

412
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,877
In truth, he's manipulating
the citizens of Alabasta

413
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,514
to bring about a civil war so
he can take over the country.

414
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,684
No one has realized what
Crocodile's doing yet‐‐

415
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,186
not the people,
not even my father.

416
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,855
Right. Well, this should be fun.

417
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,557
All we have to do is
beat up that Crocodile guy.

418
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,925
Yes, but in order to do that,

419
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,028
we have to avert the
civil war in Alabasta

420
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,130
and get Baroque Works
out of the picture.

421
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,464
[CHOPPER]
Baroque Works?

422
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,799
[USOPP]
Oh, yeah.

423
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,734
You don't know anything
about them, either.

424
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,935
To be honest, I don't understand

425
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,437
what's going on
with them myself.

426
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,805
They have a really
complicated system

427
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,940
of agents, bosses, and partners.

428
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,576
The system is actually
pretty simple.

429
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,578
First, at the very top
of the organization

430
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,447
is the boss, Crocodile.

431
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,749
He's known as Mr. 0.

432
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,052
There are a total of 12
agents and one animal

433
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,721
who receive orders
from the boss directly.

434
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,656
For the most part,
these 12 male agents

435
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,160
operate as part of a pair
with a female agent.

436
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,763
Mr. 1 is paired with
Miss Double Finger.

437
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,000
Mr. 2 doesn't actually
have a female partner.

438
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,802
[ZORO]
Mr. 3 is the candle man

439
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,770
we ran into in
Little Garden, right?

440
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,906
[VIVI] That's right,
and his partner is the painter

441
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,973
Miss Golden Week.

442
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,776
[NAMI]
Oh, yeah, that little girl.

443
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,645
[VIVI]
Mr. 4 is next in line.

444
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,613
He's paired up with
Miss Merry Christmas.

445
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,916
I don't know much more than
that about those two, though.

446
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,484
[LUFFY]
Then there's that snot guy.

447
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,151
[USOPP]
Mr. 5.

448
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:06,985
[CHOPPER]
Snot?

449
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,087
[USOPP]
Yeah, his snot is explosive.

450
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,490
[VIVI] Mr. 5's entire body
can be used as a weapon.

451
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,925
[NAMI]
His partner, Miss Valentine,

452
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,793
has the Kilo Kilo Fruit powers.

453
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,462
[ZORO] That's the woman
who can change her weight

454
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,863
whenever she wants.

455
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,699
[VIVI] The agents with codenames
from Mr. 1 through Mr. 5

456
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,501
are known as officer agents.

457
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,803
They each possess one
of the Devil Fruit powers

458
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,140
and they are only sent on
the most important missions.

459
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,844
Agents Mr. 6 through Mr. 13
have the job of fundraising.

460
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,112
They make money
for the organization

461
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,782
by heading up the employees at
the entrance to the Grand Line.

462
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,118
[SANJI] Hey, what about that
weird monkey and chicken pair

463
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:39,985
I ran into?

464
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,122
[VIVI]
That's Mr. 13 and Miss Friday.

465
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,290
They're the agency's
punishment squad.

466
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,494
They punish any agent who
fails to complete a mission.

467
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,661
And there are more.

468
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,164
Under the officer agents are
200 men called "billions."

469
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,033
And there are another 1,800
men under the frontier agents

470
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,302
that are known as "millions."

471
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,839
Together they make up the secret
crime syndicate Baroque Works.

472
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,076
Let's see, 200 plus
1,800 equals, um, uh...

473
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,711
There are 2,000 of them?!

474
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,678
Two thousand?!

475
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,914
[LUFFY] All right.
I think I understand.

476
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,649
When are we gonna
get to Alabasta

477
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,184
so I can beat up Crocodile?

478
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,686
Uh, I don't think you
get it at all, Luffy.

479
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,756
If Baroque Works' sole objective
is to take over Alabasta,

480
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,758
then I can guess
what that must mean.

481
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,594
The rest of the officer agents,
as Vivi called them,

482
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,696
and their subordinates
are probably...

483
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,900
...on their way to
Alabasta as we speak.

484
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,701
Yeah.

485
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,736
[LUFFY]
I see.

486
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,538
So, in that case, we just
go beat up Crocodile...

487
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,907
[SANJI] That's enough,
Luffy. Just let it go.

488
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,575
[LUFFY]
Okay...

489
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,211
‐‐[MR. 2] Un...
‐‐[MAN A groaning]

490
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,345
‐‐Deux...
‐‐[MAN A groaning]

491
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,281
‐‐Trois...
‐‐[MAN A groaning]

492
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,951
[MAN A] I'm sorry, Mr. 2,
Mr. Bon Clay, sir...

493
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,020
Would you idiots
quit playing around?!

494
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,855
Damn it. Are you
completely clueless?

495
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,256
Do you even know who I am?

496
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,391
[groans]

497
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,594
[MR. 2] I am Bon Clay,
a Baroque Works officer agent.

498
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,197
I strike fear into the heart
of anyone who sees me.

499
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,299
Hey, you, navigator,
tell me something.

500
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,233
Y‐Yes, sir!

501
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,135
[MR. 2] Does that little
pea brain of yours

502
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,904
remember what the boss'
exact orders were?

503
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,139
Yes, Mr. 2.

504
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,741
The orders were to kill Mr. 3 on
his way along the direct route

505
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,710
between Little Garden
and Alabasta.

506
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,744
Okay, then.

507
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,814
Maybe you're not entirely
useless, now are you?

508
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,082
[MAN A groans]

509
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,651
Taking a direct route means that
you travel in a straight line,

510
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,886
doesn't it, navigator?

511
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,622
That's why we went straight from
Alabasta to Little Garden.

512
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,057
Isn't that right?

513
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,258
‐‐[thudding]
‐‐But then something seems to

514
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,627
have gone wrong with the plan
now, hasn't it, navigator?

515
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,063
We reached Little Garden
without so much as seeing Mr. 3

516
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,131
‐‐[thudding continues]
‐‐while on our way here.

517
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,335
Now to me that seems to

No, sir. That can't be true!

[MR. 2]
Hmm.

521
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,842
It sort of sounds like you're
questioning my intelligence.

522
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,943
Not at all, sir.

523
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,345
Be quiet, you.

524
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,681
All we have to do is
kill the pathetic Mr. 3.

525
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,983
It should be an easy mission

526
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,952
and one at which we have
no excuse to fail.

527
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,954
We must complete
the mission soon.

528
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,357
If we don't, then Mr. 1 and
his partner will be sent out

529

I want this ship going as fast
as it can, you imbeciles!

We're heading to
Alabasta immediately!

What's this?

539
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,651
Pirates are attacking
towns inside the kingdom?

Don't they know this country
is protected by Crocodile?

[MISS ALL SUNDAY] Who can
tell what they're thinking.

A country where riots
are constantly brewing

543
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,161
may be considered
an easy target.

You'll go?

[CROCODILE]
Naturally.

547
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,903
I do have a public
duty to uphold.

How very kind of you, sir.

Yes, I'm a kind man.
