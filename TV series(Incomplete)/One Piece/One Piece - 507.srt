00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,724
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,427
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,995
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:45,032
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,566
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,369
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,038
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,974
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,843
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,479
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,013
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:04,017
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,653
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,057
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,260
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:17,931
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,936
[NARRATOR] After the
War of the Best in Marineford,

18
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,673
Luffy was transported
to the Maiden Island,

19
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,842
where grief over the loss
of Ace consumed him.

20
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:31,712
You still have something left
in this world to treasure,

21
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,613
don't you?!

00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:41,621

24
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,611
Huh, listen. I think
the kid stopped screaming.

25
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,078
Yeah, about that,

26
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,381
where did Straw Hat
run off to anyway?

27
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,550
I mean, he's gonna die if
that wound opens up, right?

28
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,718
Huh?

29
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,755
Huh?

30
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:15,556
Ah!

31
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,523
[PENGUIN, BEPO laugh]

32
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,525
I got one! Nice!

33
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,828
Huh?

34
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,934
Hey, what the hell?

35
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,503
I think I saw something moving.

36
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,105
Whoa! It's huge!

37
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,211

Damn! That is the biggest
Sea King I've ever seen!

40
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,720
Why is it flipping out?
It's scary!

41
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,356
[SEA KING roars]

42
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,831
[PENGUIN]
It's dead! Something killed it!

43
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,233
[SHACHI whimpers]
You gotta be joking!

44
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,069
[PENGUIN] I didn't get
a look at what happened.

45
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,271
[BEPO]
I don't think I like this place!

[HEART PIRATES gasp]

47
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,010
[PENGUIN]
Is that a man?

48
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,012
[SHACHI]
Hey! Who're you?

00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,848
[PENGUIN, SHACHI gasping]

50
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,483

What a doozy.

--It's you.
--[RAYLEIGH sighs]

53

You're the... The Dark
King Silvers Rayleigh!

[HEART PIRATES]
What?

55
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,560
Oh, it's been a while.

56
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,062
I remember meeting
you at Sabaody.

57
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,704
It's Gold Roger's first mate,
right here in the flesh.

58
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,338
[RAYLEIGH]
So, funny story.

59
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,407
Things got kind of
rocky in the storm.

60
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:43,043
My ship sank so I had
no choice but to swim here.

61
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,178
What?!

62
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,213
But they never have storms
in this part of the sea,

63
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,248
that's why they call
it the Calm Belt!

64
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,416
But then that must mean...

65
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,784
He crashed in safe waters

66
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,953
and swam through
that bed of Sea Kings?

67
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,389
How is that supposed to work?

68
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,191
[RAYLEIGH] I have
a pretty good breaststroke.

69
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,393
[PENGUIN] Right. He says
it like it's no big deal.

70
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,430
[SHACHI] So, you killed
that giant thing...

71
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,931
[SHACHI, PENGUIN]
...with your bare hands?

72
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,635
[BEPO] I have actual bear hands
and I couldn't do that!

73
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,236
[yelps]

74
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,805
Forgive me, Dark King.

75
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,339
[SHACHI, PENGUIN]
What are you even sorry for?

76
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,473
[BEPO]
Sorry!

77
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,276
Let me be frank.

78
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:17,144
[LAW grunts]

79
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,548
Something tells me Luffy's on
this island. Is that correct?

80
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:22,015
[LAW gasps]

81
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,387
[MARGARET]
Have you heard the news?

82
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,621
The princess and some others

83
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,358
just left to deliver food
to Luffy! They're so lucky!

84
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,859
I wanna make those cheeks of his

85
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,028
stretch and stretch and
stretch and stretch...

86
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,362
[MARGARET]
I heard they'll invite him over

87
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,564
once all his wounds heal.
It should be any day now!

88
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,000
[SWEET PEA]
We should hold a feast again!

89
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:40,901
[APHELANDRA]
A shame he's hurt,

90
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,270
but I'm glad he
came back so soon!

91
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:46,606
Men sure are fascinating
creatures, aren't they?

92
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,675
I wish I could be one
just for a little while,

93
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,345
so I could have fun
and be stretchy, too!

94
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,547
He shall stretch
enough for all of us!

95
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,814
[laughs]

96
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,084
Well, since he's here again,
maybe I'll make him another

97
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,286
pair of clothes,
without all the frills!

98
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,522
[ALL laughing]

99
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,560
[HANCOCK]
How shameful it is for newlyweds

100
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,063
to be separated like this! What
a tragic heroine I've become!

101
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:10,931
[NYON grunts]

102
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:13,000
"Sweetie, don't say that."

103
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,436
"You know, we're always
together in spirit!"

104
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,603
"Of course, dear!"

105
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,872
"No matter how far apart
the world may keep us,

106
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,075
we are bound by
a thread of passion!"

107
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,076
"Oh, Luffy!"

108
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,078
You always know
just what to say!

109
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,047
My heart is aflame
with affection!

110
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,516
I can feel the desire
building up inside me!

111
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,985
You are hopeless! How foolish!

112
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,721
I've told you. Any man
may remember your name,

113
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,724
but that doesn't mean
that you're married!

114
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,926
Oh? Then what is marriage?

115
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,928
What else is there to do?

116
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,231
That is a difficult
question to answer.

117
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,969
[JIMBEI] You're too weak
to travel to Sabaody,

118
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,471
especially with that wound.

119
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,739
[LUFFY]
I'll make it work.

120
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,241
I gotta see my friends
as soon as possible.

121
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,676
They'll be expecting me.

122
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,478
I promised them I'd be there.

123
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,446
Well, nevertheless...

124
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,316
[JIMBEI] Now, that's odd.
The submarine is gone.

125
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,619
Surely they didn't depart?

126
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,387
Oh, hello there, Luffy!

127
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,024
Wha...? It's Rayleigh,
the old guy!

128
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,926
[chuckles] Straightforward
as ever, I see.

129
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,527
[LUFFY]
But why are you here?

130
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,564
I was about to use my
Vivre Card to go to Sabaody

131
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,766
since my friends
should be waiting there.

132
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,602
So, did you see them?

133
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:26,072
I haven't. Actually, it seems
they haven't made it there yet.

134
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:30,210
As for my Vivre Card, I ended up
handing it off to Shakky.

135
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,845
It's rather nice.

136
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,649
No one can find me and
I can go wherever I please!

137
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,852
Dark King Rayleigh!
I don't believe this.

138
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,086
Is it really you?

139
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,557
[RAYLEIGH] Hm. You must
be that former Warlord.

140
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:46,393
Yeah, that's right.
He saved my life at Marineford.

141
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,028
[RAYLEIGH grunts]

142
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,029
Something wrong?

143
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:51,832
I didn't expect
to come face-to-face

144
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,367
with a living legend.

145
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,237
[RAYLEIGH] Ah, I suppose
you'd like your hat back.

146
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,804
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah. Thanks!

147
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,640
[LUFFY chuckles]

148
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,712
My head just doesn't
feel right without it!

149
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:07,114
There, that's a lot better!

150
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,448
[JIMBEI grunts]

151
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,185
[JIMBEI]
Have you seen a group of pirates

152
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,819
or a submarine around here?

153
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,755
[RAYLEIGH] If you're
talking about Trafalgar Law,

154
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,857
he took off.

155
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,992
He left a message for Luffy.

156
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,361
"Stay in bed for
two more weeks."

157
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,765
[RAYLEIGH]
He saved your life, didn't he?

158
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:34,674
Now that was a raw deal.
All those women right there.

159
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,978
And we were stuck on
the shore. Man, what a tease.

160
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,880
They said bears were
welcome to visit, though.

161
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,548
[SHACHI, PENGUIN]
Hey, don't tell us that!

162
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,516
[BEPO]
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,518
[SHACHI, PENGUIN]
Who cares?!

164
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:47,153
I wonder what the
Dark King is up to.

165
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,090
Seems he's drawn to another
man with the Will of D.

166
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,528
Heh. Well, whatever happens,
it's bound to be a storm.

167
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:58,999
[NYON] Nyo! It can't be!
Rayleigh, is that really you?

168
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,535
[RAYLEIGH]
Oh, why hello, Gloriosa!

169
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,170
It sure has been awhile!

170
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,371
Hi, Rayleigh!

171
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,572
How're you?

172
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,908
[RAYLEIGH]
I'm lovely! Good to see you!

173
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,242
It's Luffy!

174
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,178
[SANDERSONIA, MARIGOLD] Could
you show some manners for once?

175
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,781
Don't ignore the man
who saved your life!

176
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:14,948
He "saved your life"?

177
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,318
So, the three of you know
old man Rayleigh, too?

178
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,586
Indeed!

179
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,254
It's a long story.
We'll spare you the details.

180
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,157
[HANCOCK] I'm so glad
to see that you're well.

181
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,825
I've been awake for days,
worrying about you.

182
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:28,295
You must be starving!
I've brought plenty of food.

183
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,031
Please, eat to your
heart's content.

184
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,966
[NYON] You can't even
bear to look at him.

185
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,636
How is this "marriage" of
yours supposed to work out?

186
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,938
[HANCOCK]
Serve the man!

187
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,274
Give him some food,
and be quick about it!

188
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,809
[stomach rumbling]

189
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,544
[JIMBEI grunts]

190
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,078
No, Jimbei!

191
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,815
This cornucopia was
not meant for you!

192
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,783
You may have one bite.

193
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,584
[JIMBEI]
How generous.

194
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,454
I shall endeavor
to curb my appetite.

195
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,491
Come, Luffy.
You need your strength.

196
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,795
And as they say,
"to eat is to live."

197
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,167
[stomach rumbling]

198
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,113
Well done! Back to
the old Luffy already!

199
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,283
[RAYLEIGH laughs]

200
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,889
[MARIGOLD laughs]

201
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,161
I said a bite!

202
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,597
Keep stuffing
your face like that

203
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,498
and you'll leave
poor Luffy with nothing!

204
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,433
[JIMBEI gagging]

205
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,905
[NYON]
Hm? A letter from Shakky!

206
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,340
Thank you for
bringing this, Rayleigh.

207
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,011
She hasn't changed,
nyot one bit.

208
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,781
Yeah. If you were
living in Sabaody again,

209
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:57,084
it'd be just like old times.
She's doing well.

210
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,318
And you girls,

211
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,088
you three have gotten tough
over the past 13 years,

212
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,157
possessing a strength that is
only matched by your beauty.

213
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,328
Rayleigh, Granny
Nyon, and Shakky.

214
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,595
If it weren't for you three,

215
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,800
we'd still be slaves to the
Celestial Dragons right now.

216
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,069
This troubles me.
If you found him,

217
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,974
protecting Luffy may be more
difficult than we thought.

218
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,475
I knyow you're friends,

219
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,744
but if you could find
Luffy so quickly,

220
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:27,681
I fear the Navy's search for him
may prove successful as well.

221
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,416
Then we'd all be in danger.

222
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,487
Ah. If it isn't Rayleigh!
It's me, Hancock!

223
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,088
Do you remember me?

224
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,958
Really? You just
now nyoticed him?!

225
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,193
[chuckles]

226
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,427
Don't worry,

227
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,963
I doubt the Navy will guess
that Luffy's staying here.

228
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,232
[RAYLEIGH]
First off,

229
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,868
the one who helped him escape
from the Sabaody Archipelago

230
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,403
told me he sent him off
in this direction.

231
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,843
Huh? Kuma?

232
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,178
[KUMA] I work for
the Revolutionary Army.

233
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,781
Because Straw Hat shares
a connection with Dragon,

234
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,182
I will let his crew escape.

235
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,249
[RAYLEIGH]
Hm?

236
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,686
[SHAKKY]
Oh? That's quite the twist.

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,490
So, where did he end up
sending our Monkey boy?

238
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,925
Beats me.

239
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,732
[KUMA] I apologize for
my abrupt manner earlier.

240
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,001
Can I speak with
you for a moment?

241
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:25,940
I don't have much
time, not as myself.

242
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,708
[RAYLEIGH]
Hm?

243
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,344
Now, as for Straw Hat...

244
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,279
Kuma would only tell
me what direction

245
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,781
he sent our friend
Luffy flying in.

246
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,983
But even that info didn't

247
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:38,852
necessarily point
to this island.

248
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,155
However, some interesting
details came to light

249
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,391
when I was looking into the
events leading up to Marineford.

250
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,793
Namely, the Impel
Down prison break

251
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,396
caused by Luffy and the others.

252
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,298
I spent a lot of time
puzzling over

253
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:55,468
how Luffy was able to infiltrate
such a heavily guarded prison.

254
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,004
It made enough sense that Luffy
got there by stowing away

255
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,909
on a Navy ship with Hancock,
but it still didn't add up.

256
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:05,613
[NYON]
Hmm.

257
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,147
[RAYLEIGH]
Hancock is known to hate both

258
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,149
the World Government and men.

259
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,852
I don't think she'd willingly
get on a government ship,

260
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,887
certainly not to help a man.

261
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:18,158
Knowing that, how else would
Luffy have gotten there?

262
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,393
[SHAKKY]
Have you considered this one?

263
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:26,600
Maybe Hancock met Monkey and had
a case of "love at first sight."

264
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,935
If so, everything fits.

265
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,373
[SHAKKY]
He is pretty cute, after all.

266
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,478
It's also a lovely way
to spite the Navy,

267
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,546
and now she's got
the perfect opportunity

268
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,549
to nurse her poor, injured
loverboy back to health.

269
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,085
[laughs] I think you're
letting your imagination

270
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,087
get carried away, Shakky!

271
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:53,027
[RAYLEIGH] Guess that's the
power of women's intuition.

272
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,828
That's my Shakky!

273
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:58,231
The Snake Princess is,
well, see for yourself.

274
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,202
[HANCOCK] Do you like it? Please
say yes! It's all just for you!

275
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,705
Although our little theory
turned out to be true,

276
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,941
it's still pretty ridiculous,

277
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:09,576
so the Navy won't act on it.

278
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,612
All right. It's time
we got down to business.

279
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,549
[RAYLEIGH]
Hey, Luffy.

280
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,951
Earlier you said you're
heading back to Sabaody

281
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:21,288
to meet up with your crew.
Do you still plan on doing that?

282
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,459
Of course, I do. They need me.

283
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,597
Maybe they do,

284
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,665
but is that the best choice?

285
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,400
[LUFFY grunts]

286
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,553
[RAYLEIGH]
Think back.

287
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,193
Surely, you remember how your
last trip to Sabaody ended.

288
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,727
[gasps]

289
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,868
Everyone!

290
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:11,038
Start running and
look after yourselves!

291
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:15,309
We can't win this one!
We're too weak!

292
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,143
Get moving!

293
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:33,393
[LUFFY crying]

294
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:37,531
I couldn't save any of them.

295
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong with me?

296
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:45,005
[LUFFY crying]

297
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:50,777
[LUFFY gasping]

298
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:02,990
As you are right now,

299
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,525
do you think you
would fare any better

300
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,260
if you were to face
those enemies again?

301
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,378
I know, but I...

302
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,414
[RAYLEIGH] Do you want to
be reunited with your friends,

303
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,484
only to endure the same fate?

304
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,618
[LUFFY grunts]

305
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:35,122
I would imagine that
your answer is no.

306
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,158
So let me offer you some advice.

307
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:39,960
Do with it what you will.

308
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:53,540
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, on the
Bowin Islands on the Grand Line.

309
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,345
[HERACLES]
Come back here, Usopp'n!

310
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,181
[USOPP]
Don't try to stop me!

311
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:05,319
[NARRATOR] Usopp seems to
be... moving his massive body,

312
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,488
which has grown huge
from eating an abundant

313
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,257
variety of food from
the Gorging Forest.

314
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,294
[NARRATOR]
Some might call it running.

315
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,197
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n, it's impossible!

316
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,234
[USOPP] No, it's not!
I'll keep trying till I get it!

317
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,669
I can do it this time!

318
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:25,071
[GIANT BEETLE bellows]

319
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,607
[panting]

320
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,409
There you are!

321
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,645
[GIANT BEETLE snarls]

322
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,748
[USOPP]
Get out of my way, you big oaf!

323
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,717
Special Attack...

324
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,186
[USOPP groans]

325
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,856
[HERACLES]
Oh, no! Usopp'n!

326
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,628
[USOPP groans]

327
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,964
[HERACLES]
Why won't you heed my warnings?

328
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,199
Damn it. So close.

329
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,700
[HERACLES]
You can't do this!

330
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:56,570
Every time you try to
get off of the island'n,

331
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,939
terrifying creatures
like the giant beetle'n

332
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:03,377
will stand in your way and force
you back into the forest'n.

333
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,213
[USOPP grunts]

334
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,050
[HERACLES]
There's nothing to stop you

335
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,221
from entering the island'n,
but then, your fate is sealed!

336
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,723
Even if you can learn
to survive in the forest,

337
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:19,693
no one ever leaves
this island'n alive!

338
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:24,731
And don't forget,
my name is Heracles'n!

339
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,501
Huh? Usopp'n? Where did you go?

340
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,003
[rumbling]

341
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,103
[HERACLES]
Huh?

342
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,907
[GIANT SEA HIPPO grunts]

343
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,142
[HERACLES]
Oh, no!

344
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,278
The sea creature'n has just
crawled onto the island'n!

345
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:41,381
Usopp'n! You're in danger!

346
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,618
[HERACLES yells]

347
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:47,021
[NARRATOR] The sweet flavors
and intoxicating aromas

348
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,955
that emanate from
the Bowin Islands

349
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:52,225
attract a plethora of
giant insects and birds.

350
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,097
Even Sea Kings and other aquatic
animals visit from time to time.

351
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,565
It's a sea hippo!

352
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,634
[GIANT SEA HIPPO snorts, sniffs]

353
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:03,770
[USOPP] Now's not the time
to stop and stare!

354
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,006
[NARRATOR] The wonderful
smells lead them deeper

355
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,977
onto the island. There, they
find ever more tempting flavors.

356
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,484
[NARRATOR] But while it's
easy to enter the island...

357
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,622
[NARRATOR]
...it's much harder to leave.

358
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:24,324
[USOPP panting]

359
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,726
--[TEETHED PLANT A growls]
--[USOPP] Another one!

360
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,061
Try my Exploding Star!

361
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm getting out of here
no matter what it takes!

362
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,904
Don't you dare get in my way!

363
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:41,909
[USOPP] I'll make it back
to Sabaody or die trying!

364
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,411
They're all waiting for me!

365
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,048
[USOPP]
Exploding Star!

366
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,984
Exploding Star!

367
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:56,390
Exploding Star! Exploding Star!

368
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,026
[USOPP panting]

369
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,661
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n!

370
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:01,862
[USOPP grunts]

371
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,464
[HERACLES] The islands
are gonna move again!

372
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:05,432
Wait. Do what now?

373
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,269
--[rumbling]
--[USOPP gasps]

374
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:12,439
[HERACLES] Usopp'n!
Grab a tree and hang on!

375
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,241
[USOPP]
How often does this happen?

376
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,710
[HERACLES]
Every time it needs to feed!

377
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,384
[NARRATOR]
The so-called Bowin Islands

378
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,519
are not at all what they appear.

379
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:37,397
[screaming]

380
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,868
[NARRATOR]
The flower-shaped island is

381
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,038
actually an island-sized flower
known as the Stomach Baron.

382
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,440
[USOPP screams]

383
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:49,609
[HERACLES]
Usopp'n!

384
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,679
[USOPP gasps]

385
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:56,316
[panting]

386
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,153
[HERACLES]
What has gotten into you?

387
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,124
[HERACLES] Ever since the
News Coo brought that paper,

388
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,893
you've been acting
like a maniac!

389
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:06,694
What did it say?

390
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,230
[crying]

391
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,900
[USOPP]
I can't be here!

392
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,901
I have to go!

393
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:18,004
I've wasted enough time
on this stupid island!

394
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,447
[USOPP] Luffy, he lost
his brother in the war!

395
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:33,387
And now, he doesn't know where
we are, or if we're alive!

396
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:38,425
[crying]

397
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:55,442
Luffy wouldn't let me
suffer like that!

398
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,879
I'm his friend! I need
to be there for him!

399
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:01,682
[USOPP crying]

400
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:06,419
[USOPP]
I'm sorry, Luffy!

401
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,028
[NARRATOR]
Worried about their captain,

402
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,898
the Straw Hat Pirates concoct
plans for a speedy escape.

403
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:20,901
Unfortunately for Nami,
this lands her in a jail cell.

404
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,569
Meanwhile, Franky
searches for a ship

405
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,138
that can deliver him from
his frozen surroundings.

406
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:28,441
A trip to a secret lab gives
him hope and danger alike.

407
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,044
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

408
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,147
"Back to Our Captain!
A Jail Break at the Sky Island

409
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,115
and the Incident
on the Winter Island!"

410
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,551
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
