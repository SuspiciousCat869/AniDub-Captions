1
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,290
Anyways. After this, where're
you folks headed off to?

2
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,426
Thanks, but there's no
reason for us to take the train

3
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,295
when we have our own ship.
We'll just follow the log.

4
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,166
I see. Well, in that case,
it's Water Seven for sure.

5
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,467
Water Seven, huh?

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,069
They got great shipyards.

7
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,271
You might say that's
their claim to fame.

8
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,074
When it comes to boats,
they're first class!

9
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,208
All right then it's settled!

10
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,477
We're gonna find the best
shipwright in Water Seven

11
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,412
and get him to join our crew!

12
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,253
[LUFFY] Nobody told me it
was gonna be this cool!

13
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,154
[USOPP]
Hmmm...

14
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,722
Should be okay to
anchor here, right?

15
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,560
Holy crap. If the Merry's
falling apart this easy,

16
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,295
we're lucky we
made it here at all!

17
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,696
[SHOP MAN A]
Here, take this.

18
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,266
Oh! A map!

19
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,567
Thanks for the help!

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,501
That'll be perfect.

21
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,336
We can head straight
to the shipyard soon

22
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,704
as we trade in our gold!

23
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,573
Well, you're not gonna hear
any complaints from me.

24
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,642
As long as the Merry gets
repaired, I'll be happy!

25
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,312
Yeah! Go Yagara!

26
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,279
[SHOP MAN A]
See you later!

27
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:03,183
Thanks for business
and have a safe trip!

28
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,455
[LUFFY] Downtown, full
speed ahead! Yahoo!

29
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,242
[LUFFY]
This is great! Hahahahaha!

30
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,510
You're the best, horse fish!

31
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,414
[USOPP] We might not be
traveling in style,

32
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,649
but I gotta admit,
this sure is handy!

33
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,152
I never thought riding
a fish would be so comfy!

34
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,620
[CHILD A]
Over here! Over here!

35
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,188
[CHILD B]
'Kay, here it comes!

36
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,790
[CHILD C]
No problem!

37
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,325
[CHILD D]
Oh no! It's too high!

38
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:44,925
[CHILD A]
Get ready!

39
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:45,526
[CHILD B]
Watch out!

40
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,694
[CHILD A]
I got it!

41
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,763
[CHILD C] Ah man, no fair!
You did that last time, too!

42
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,464
[CHILD D]
I was gonna get that one!

43
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,367
I wanna play, too!

44
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,538
[USOPP]
Ahhh...

45
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,708
I didn't think there'd be canals
running by people's houses, too!

46
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,142
They're everywhere!

47
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,212
[NAMI]
I'm trying to follow the map,

48
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
but I don't want
to miss anything!

49
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,217
Hey there, buddy!

50
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,819
[LUFFY]
Right back at 'cha!

51
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,555
Whatcha doing here?
Going sightseeing?

52
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,524
No, we're gonna have our
ship repaired at the shipyard!

53
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,827
[MAN A] I see! In that case,
you should probably go

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,529
to the backstreet
shopping district first!

55
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,631
[MAN B]
Checkmate.

56
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,266
[LUFFY]
Thanks!

57
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,467
Sure.

58
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,704
Backstreet shopping district.
Let's take the next right.

59
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,774
Oh! Hello, mademoiselle!

60
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,510
Would you like to have dinner?

61
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,677
Uh...

62
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,216
[sounds of a struggle]

63
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,051
[WOMAN A] Don't mind
him--it's nothing.

64
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,786
Men around here always
greet the ladies like

65
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,488
that when they
see one passing by.

66
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,391
[chuckles uncomfortably]

67
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,325
[WOMAN A]
Would you stop flirting

68
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,326
with girls for five minutes

69
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,495
and get some work done
for once in your life?!

70
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,497
[MAN C] Yes, darling,
you're the boss.

71
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,135
It's not that I don't
appreciate a warm welcome,

72
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,370
but these people are so
friendly, it's kinda weird.

73
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,706
[MAN D] Hey!
You with the long nose!

74
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,807
Huh?

75
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,075
[MAN D] Nothin'. I was
just saying hey, that's all.

76
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,645
You're lucky I'm down here!

77
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:21,722
Uh, we're about to
go against the flow.

78
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,258
Is that okay? We're not
supposed to go up, are we?

79
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,166
[NAMI] Wait, wrong way!
Go right! Right!

80
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,238
Awesome! You horse fish
can swim uphill, too?!

81
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:39,239
What can't you do?!

82
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,578
[LUFFY] Look! The canals go
on top of the buildings!

83
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,512
[NAMI]
Who cares?!

84
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,648
We're going the wrong way!

85
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,817
We need to go to
the shopping district!

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,518
Why? What's the rush?

87
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,521
You wanna see the rest
of the city, don't you?

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,561
[USOPP] Ahhh!! Look! Look!
Do something! Turn around!

89
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,729
[LUFFY laughs]
Oh yeah,

90
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,397
we're up pretty
high, aren't we?

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,366
[USOPP]
That not what I want to hear.

92
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,679
Faster!

93
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,114
This is fast enough, thank you!

94
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,282
Aaaaaahh!

95
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,062
Sorry!

96
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,736
[laughs]

97
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,438
Aaaaaahhh!! Help me!

98
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,706
We're falling, we're
falling, we're falling,

99
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,241
we're falling, we're falling,
we're falling, we're falling!

100
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,223
[NAMI] UGH!
Stop showing off!

101
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,428
Huh?

102
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,398

[LUFFY] Ah! Oh man!
Check out all the stuff!

110
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,455
[NAMI] We ended up in the
shopping district after all!

111
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:39,626
Wait. You guys took
a shortcut, didn't you?

112
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,429
I'm sorry!

113
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,099
You're a lot smarter
than I gave you credit for!

114
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,334
[USOPP] This has gotta be the
biggest market I've ever seen!

115
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,104
[LUFFY] Uh-huh.
Whoa! Look!

116
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,605
That bull is huge!

117
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,708
[USOPP] Whoa! Should we move?
It's coming straight at us!

118
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,752
[USOPP]
That thing is scary!

119
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,253
[LUFFY]
You think he eats people?

120
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,555
[NAMI] I wonder if this
one is a "King"?

121
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,724
Huh? What's with them?

122
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,495
They're all wearing
masks. That's weird.

123
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,830
Wow. Neat. They're pretty.

124
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,765
They must be going to a party.

125
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,736
What's up? See something?

126
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,740
Freshly made water-water
octopus dumplings for sale!

127
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:30,344
Three water-water
croquettes, coming up!

128
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,179
I didn't know they sold food!

129
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,548
I'm hungry!
Let's buy everything!

130
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,318
Wait! Go back!

131
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,453
[USOPP] Hey, Luffy!
Where're you going?!

132
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,256
I dunno... Ask my ride!

133
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,390
[NAMI and USOPP]
Huh?

134
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,198
Hello, there!
How may I help you?

135
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,801
I see,so you
were hungry, too!

136
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,735
[MERCHANT LADY B]
Water-water meat

137
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,403
is the Yagara's favorite food.

138
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,539
Although we usually
cook it for humans.

139
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,609
Meat, huh?
I'll take ten please!

140
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,043
[MERCHANT LADY B]
They're so good that the cooks

141
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,346
from the Gourmet Town
come buy them in secret!

142
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,714
Bet you've never had
anything like it, huh?

143
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:16,290
So soft! Yummy!

144
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,791
Whoa, really? They're good?!

145
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,393
Let me try one, Luffy!

146
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,429
No way! I'm not sharing!

147
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,298
[USOPP]
Nami, he's being mean!

148
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,834
Make him share with me!

149
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,168
[NAMI]
More masks.

150
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,371
People all over town
are wearing them.

151
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,738
[USOPP]
Nami!

152
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,041
[NAMI] There's something
strange about this.

153
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,612
[USOPP]
Nami! Are you listening?!

154
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,652
[MAN F] Hey! Some pirates
are causing a ruckus at Dock #1!

155
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,687
[MAN G]
What?! That's not good!

156
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,055
[MAN H] Come on!
We'd better go check this out!

157
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,626
[PAULIE] Sorry, but you're
not making any sense.

158
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,328
[MIKAZUKI] Need me
to talk slow for you?

159
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,232
Hahahaha!

160
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,768
Soooooo you
repaired our ship.

161
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,737
Sooooo then I got to thinking.

162
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,506
And no matter
how I looked at it,

163
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,142
no matter how many times
I turned our little deal

164
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,177
around in my head,
I still felt like you

165
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,546
were charging me way too much.

166
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,748
You're interrupting our job.

167
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,849
[MIKAZUKI]
Here's the deal.

168
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,353
I'm not paying a single
berry for the work you did.

169
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,488
[MIKAZUKI CREW laughs]

170
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:25,159
[MIKAZUKI CREW A] Thanks for
the repairs, they were great!

171
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,562
[MIKAZUKI CREW B] So kind
of you to do them for free!

172
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,808
[ICEBERG] Mmwell... Kalifa.

173
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,176
You know what's going on?

174
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,410
[KALIFA] Yes, Mr. Iceberg.

175
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,446
Those pirates are
Dock 1 customers.

176
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,149
But now that the work's
done, they refuse to pay.

177
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,285
Sexual harassment.

178
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,455
Mmwell. Maybe it is.

[MIKAZUKI CREW laughs]

181
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,272
Listen, Sir, we take
our jobs very seriously.

182
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:13,673
It's not wise to mock
our shipwrights like that.

183
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,653
[MIKAZUKI CREW A]
Captain!

184
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,724
[CARPENTER A]
Oops. Sorry!

185
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,525
Hey jerk!

186
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,394
Watch where you
swing that thing!

187
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,596
You just knocked out our-- Ahh!

188
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,433
[KAKU]
Oops. Sorry.

189
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,202
Hey, you punks
trying to pick a fight?!

190
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,070
Who do you think you are?!

191
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,015
Oh yeah.

192
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,718
We haven't had a chance to
test fire that cannon, have we?

193
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,753
No. Not yet.

194
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,291
Damn you!

195
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,727
You won't get
away with this!

196
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,162
We'll be back! Just wait!

197
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,111
You're on shipwright turf.

198
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,279
This is what
happens when you try

199
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,514
to pull that pirate
crap around here.

200
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:51,705
[NAMI]
This is it.

201
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,607
As soon as we take
the water gate elevator,

202
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,376
we'll be at shipbuilding
island in no time.

203
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,481
What's this water gate thing?

204
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,616
[NAMI] It's that tower
right ahead of us.

205
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,391
[ELEVATOR GIRL A]
Attention everyone!

206
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,395
The elevator is ready to go.

207
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,263
Bulls and riders enter now!

208
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,133
[ELEVATOR GIRL A] Proceed in
an orderly fashion, please!

Passengers should enter
the elevator quickly.

212
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,443
The gate will be closing
in only one minute!

213
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,482
Something crazy's gonna
happen, I just know it!

214
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,124
[LUFFY]
The gate closed! It's starting!

215
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,293
[USOPP] We're going up!
We're going up! We're going up!

216
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,034
I see! First you go in.
The gate shuts.

217
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,502
The water fills the elevator,

218
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,639
and then everybody
floats to the top!

219
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,409
I still don't get it
but it sure is awesome!

220
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,379
[NAMI] They really do use
water for everything here!

Who you callin' Moss Head, jerk?

223
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,561
You awake?

224
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:21,662
Huh...?

225
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,130
You know where Robin went?

226
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,099
She's not on the ship.

227
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,433
Hmmm...

228
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,469
Oh, I remember.

229
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:31,305
She... uh... said she was
going out with Chopper.

230
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,172
What?

231
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,475
They were doing
some shopping, I think.

232
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:35,609
[SANJI]
What the hell?!

233
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,679
Does that mean I'm stuck
on this ship alone with you?!

234
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,749
That's gotta be the most
boring thing in the world!

00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:45,052
[ZORO]
Yep. That's why I'm sleeping.

236
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,787
Fine. I need to do
our grocery shopping,

237
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,622
so I'm taking off, too.

238
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,525
Take good care of the
boat while I'm gone.

Asleep already, huh?
Whatever.

241
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,165
Keep up the good work.

We made it!

So this is the best shipyard

in the whole world, huh?

245
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,040
It's even fancier than
the rest of the town!

246
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,780
[USOPP] They've got a lot
more ground to work with

247
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,716
than the residential
district, that's for sure.

248
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,456
Everything's huge! So cool!

249
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:00,561
Of course it's cool,
this place is the best!

250
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,563
It's great seeing
the fountain up close.

251
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,798
It really is
beautiful, isn't it?

252
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,076
[USOPP] There's a bunch
of people over there.

253
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,078
Think something's going
on at the shipyard?

254
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,348
[LUFFY] Let's go check
it out! Go, Yagara!

Look! Over there!

00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:33,127
It's Lucci!
He's so handsome!

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,762
[BUSYBODY MAN A]
Paulie's here today too, right?

258
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,630
[BUSYBODY MAN B] Who cares
about those guys, huh?!

259
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,432
Now Lulu, that's a real man.

260
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,568
Just look at that moustache!

261
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:41,268
[BUSYBODY MAN C]
Whatever!

262
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:44,304
Nobody's manlier than Tilestone!

00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,206
[LUFFY]
Hey mister.

264
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,141
Hmm?

265
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,642
What's this crowd about?

266
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,111
Oh. It was just some
boneheaded pirates

267
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,814
trying to pick a fight
with the shipwrights again.

268
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,216
Y'know happens all the time.

269
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,519
But our guys sent
'em packing, like always.

270
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,055
Those pirates'll
never learn their lesson.

271
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,356
Whoa, that's nuts.

272
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,224
The shipwrights
can beat up pirates?

273
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,360
Ah, you must be tourists, huh?

274
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,661
The shipwrights are, well...

275
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,331
...they're like
celebrities to us.

276
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,233
In fact, you might say that
this crowd is their fan club.

277
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,203
We're always watching
the Galley-La Company.

278
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,538
They're strong.

279
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,373
They're skilled.

280
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:23,043
And they're the pride of
every citizen in Water Seven.

281
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,221
Wow. I can't wait to meet them!

Hey, Luffy.

283
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,424

Huh?

284
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,394
Let's hurry up and get
the gold traded in, okay?

285
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,061
This is fun.

286
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,729
But it can wait 'til later.

287
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,511
[ROBIN]
It says that we're

288
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:58,646
in the backstreet
shopping district.

289
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,814
[CHOPPER] It seems awfully
crowded for a backstreet,

290
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,649
if you ask me.

291
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,353
Kinda neat that they have
places to walk around, though.

292
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,789
They must've put a lot of
thought into the town's design.

293
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,190
[CHOPPER]
Yeah.

294
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,761
Scary!!

295
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,797

once-in-a-lifetime beauty!

[CHOPPER]
Ugh...

00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,272
This place is
full of Sanjis.

301
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,640
[chuckles]

302
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,679
[CHOPPER]
What is that guy selling?!

303
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,113
It looks creepy!

304
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,348
[ROBIN]
It's just a mask shop.

305
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,053
I noticed a lot of people
around town wearing them,

306
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:40,354
so they must buy
them from there.

307
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,422
It's something you wear?

308
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,690
I thought that was their face!

309
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,758
Wow that's a big relief!

310
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:48,729
[ROBIN]
It seems the people here

311
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:51,231
take the Sea Train
to San Faldo Island,

312
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,567
where they hold a
costume carnival every day.

313
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,069
[CHOPPER]
Huh? How do you know that?

314
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,604
We just got here!

315
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:59,139
[ROBIN] The people walking
by are talking about it.

316
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,576
[CHOPPER] Whoa and you
hear everything they say?

317
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,244
I can't help it.

318
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,513
Ever since I was young,

319
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,482
I've made it a habit
to keep a critical eye

320
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,617
and ear on my environment.

321
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,222
Wow, Robin that's cool.

322
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,795
[ROBIN]
Huh... Doctor.

323
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,862
[CHOPPER]
Hm?

324
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,399
[ROBIN] See that? I think
we found your bookstore.

325
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,633
Oh! Really?

326
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,337
Can we go inside now?!

327
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,306
[ROBIN chuckles]
Of course. Be my guest.

328
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,674
Today is the best day ever!

[BLUNO]
CP9.

330
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,707
Hey! What're you waiting for?!

331
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:39,606
[thinking] If I'm in my human
form maybe it'll be okay?

332
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,510
My! What a funny mask!

333
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,812
What's your costume?

334
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:48,716
Oh... uh... a human reindeer?

335
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,286
Hmm! Ahahaha! As long
as you're having fun, right?

336
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,224
Hey, wait.

337
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,698
Robin?

338
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,335
[CHOPPER]
Hello? Robin?!

339
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,075
Pity, I was hoping that we
could kill you in your sleep.

340
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,382
You bastards sure
got a lot of nerve.

341
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,616
Who are you?

344
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,564
[USOPP] Yeah! I mean what!

345
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:20,134
[LUFFY] Oh, but that Usopp
had a square nose, huh?

346
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,535
[USOPP] Round noses
are more manly.

347
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,737
[ICEBERG] Mmwell, you
must be Straw Hat Luffy.

348
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,738
My name's Iceberg.

349
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,440
[LUFFY] You're the
boss around here, right?!

350
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,575
Then repair our ship!

351
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:28,676
[ICEBERG]
Sure.

352
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,610
[USOPP] You're not even
gonna think about it first?!

353
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:31,378
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

354
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,614
"The Franky Family and Iceberg."

355
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,383
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
