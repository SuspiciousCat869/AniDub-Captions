1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:03,136
Mozu!

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,310
Kiwi!

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,745
I apologize for
the interruption.

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,384
It's just those
two ladies weren't

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:20,287
being very accommodating
about letting us in.

6
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:24,424
What the hell are you
bastards doing down here?!

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,329
Iron Body!

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,364
Hey! What's the big idea?

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,569
What gives, Blueno?!

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,372
You got some kinda
problem with me?!

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,507
Oh trying to pull
a reverse move?!

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,110
You dumbass, you should
know better than that!

13
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,014
No one pushes me around!

14
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,189
You should be pourin'
me a drink, remember?!

15
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,791
What did you forget
you're just a bartender?

16
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,160
And what's with
that outfit anyway?

17
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,329
What the hell are you up to?!

18
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,067
Not yet!

19
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:16,744
Whoa! Are you okay?
Come on man, get up!

20
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,246
Killing him now would put
our mission in jeopardy.

21
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,314
We need him alive.

22
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:20,981
Right.

23
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,716
Hey! What's going on here?!

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,186
I mean what did you do to piss
off these shipyard guys so bad?

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,588
The freak with the bird?

26
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,523
How'd he get a hit
like that on me!?

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,357
And what's the deal?

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,625
Why're you guys
comin' in on my turf

29
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,595
with a chip on your shoulders,
actin' like you own the place?

30
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,531
And hittin' girls?!
That's so not cool!

31
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,035
Kiwi and Mozu are like my
little sisters, you know?!

32
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,337
How'd you freaks even
find us here anyway?

33
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,573
This is my ultra
top secret base!

34
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:49,109
How we found you's irrelevant
as we are here right now.

35
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,210
But know this.

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,047
We came to this town
assigned to a covert operation.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,548
We're special agents--

38
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,518
spies working for the
world government.

39
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,386
I assume even you
would know why

40
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,823
we came here and
what we're after.

41
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,694
Franky, we know the
secret that you're keeping.

42
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,662
Cutty Flam.

43
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,698
The rumor was that
Tom's apprentice

44
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,467
perished about eight years ago.

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,104
But you're still alive.

46
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,340
That's some pretty
amazing detective work.

47
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,141
I'm real impressed.

48
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,179
But I'm startin' to get a
sour feeling down in my gut.

49
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,415
Where is he? Where
the hell is Iceberg?

50
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,050
He's dead.

51
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,571
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

52
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,578
It's too late to
feign innocence.

53
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,512
We already know everything.

54
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,716
It's only a matter of time

55
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,285
before the
government targets me.

56
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,389
I want you to take these
and leave the island, Franky.

57
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,091
Tom entrusted them to Iceberg

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,795
and Iceberg
entrusted them to you.

59
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,097
Hey, boys, come here.

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,767
It's about time I let you
in on somethin' important!

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,537
It's been a long game but
now we're at checkmate.

62
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,408
See, I know you have the
plans for the ancient weapon.

63
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,412
Hand over Pluton's
blueprints, Cutty Flam.

64
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:14,248
Flam, huh? That's
kind of a funny name.

65
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,784
How about we just call
you Franky instead?

66
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,519
Whatever.

67
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,621
Are you listening?

68
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,024
Hand them over this instant.

69
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,594
Oh, did you say hand?

70
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,575
What the hell did he just do?

71
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,178
It was so fast I couldn't
see what happened.

72
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,180
Hey! Are you okay?!

73
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,255
Oh my.

74
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,789
You found a room.

75
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,360
What do you suppose is
this filthy place's purpose?

76
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,128
Those are drafting tables.

77
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:07,033
Yes. Where blueprints are made
and perhaps hidden. Find them!

78
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:24,351
Look here, nameplates.
Cutty Flam. Iceberg. Tom.

79
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,519
The shipwright.

80
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,158
This picture.

81
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:35,562
Keep your paws off of that!

82
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,732
You're pokin' your noses
into my personal space.

83
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:43,671
My memories! This is the
place where I grew up.

84
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,307
What used to house the
shipbuilding company,

85
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,309
Tom's Workers.
Where the best

86
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,545
damn shipwright that ever
lived plied his craft.

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,766
Sea King!!! Eat this!

88
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,617
Ahhhhhh! Watch out Iceberg!

89
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,692
Hey! What in the hell
is wrong with you!!

90
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,100
Ow!

91
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,635
Idiot! Don't you know
you're not supposed to

92
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,769
be goofin' around right now?

93
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:51,538
We got real ships to work on,
not your crappy toys!

94
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,240
Don't yell at me when
you don't have a clue

95
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,309
what you're talkin'
about, ice-for-brains!

96
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,711
It isn't some crappy toy,
it's my super battleship,

97
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,678
The Battle Franky!

98
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,081
Whatever it is, you
need to leave it alone

99
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,148
before someone gets hurt!

100
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,085
This is Scrap Heap Island!
I can do what I want!

101
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,387
Wait! You'll see.

102
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,389
I'm gonna build a
battleship awesome enough

103
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:09,456
to take down a sea king!

104
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,192
Bull! What you're gonna
do is get yourself killed!

105
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,093
Oh yeah?

106
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:13,794
Yeah! Quick!

107
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,662
Nu-uh!

108
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,795
Real quick!

109
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:25,105
If you wanna be a man.
Show some gusto!

110
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,625
Well there's the ol'
launching ceremony.

111
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:49,263
One more ship sailing
with gusto! Right, buddy?

112
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,798
Erp! Erp! Erp!

113
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,200
That's about enough
work for today.

114
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,035
Whaddaya say
we head on home?

115
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,337
Erp! Erp!

116
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,105
Man, I'm hungry!

117
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:58,772
Erp! Erp!

118
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,274
Let's see what's for dinner!

119
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,775
Erp! Erp!

120
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,212
Hey, hold on! Wait for us!

121
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:16,357
So today's Battle Franky model
was number-what-are-you-up to?

122
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,826
Eight sir! It was
really beautiful!

123
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,960
No it wasn't!

124
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:22,229
Your dumb weapon that he
let you build for some reason

125
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,665
fell apart after you almost
killed both of us with it!

126
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,800
Nobody asked you, ya
stupid Ice-for-brains!

127
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,437
Ice-for-brains?
Well you're Flunky!

128
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,278
Alright. That's enough
fighting, boys. Cut it out.

129
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,279
He started it. Not me!

130
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,817
My word. Don't
encourage those two, Tom.

131
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,286
Was it that funny?

132
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,588
Keep laughing and
they'll keep misbehaving.

133
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,822
Speaking of misbehaving.

134
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,358
I heard that another
ship carrying lumber

135
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,559
was attacked by pirates.

136
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,829
I swear, ever since the King
of the Pirates was executed

137
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,366
this place has just gone rotten
with those no-good bums.

138
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,268
They're taking over the city.

139
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:04,305
The people's spirits
are really low.

140
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,340
And because of all the
flooding from Aqua Laguna,

141
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,108
we can only get lumber and iron

142
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,743
if we ship them in
from other islands.

143
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,379
But with all the storms
and pirates everywhere,

144
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,248
it's near impossible.

145
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,151
The shipyards are starting to
get so desperate for customers,

146
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,653
they are literally fighting
each other for them.

147
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,256
So many have
closed down already.

148
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,826
At this rate, Water Seven is on
a course to sink into the ocean,

149
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,661
and fade from
the world's memory.

150
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,763
And to think, this
city made its name

151
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:33,500
making unforgettable,
unsinkable ships. Such a shame.

152
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,337
Hey, you built a big,
super-awesome pirate ship once,

153
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,738
now didn't ya Tom?

154
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:40,707
Will ya teach me how to
draw up blueprints for one, too?

155
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,679
What's so funny, huh?

156
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:50,184
Franky, there's no such thing
as blueprints for a pirate ship.

157
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:54,521
It's the flag, boy. Skull
and bones means pirate ship.

158
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,658
And a seagull flag
means that it's Navy.

159
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,294
Whatever you build
just remember this.

160
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:05,732
Build it with pride and a
whole lot of manly gusto!

161
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,141
You sure are working late
tonight. What're ya drawin'?

162
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:18,245
This here. Is hope
for our island.

163
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,480
It is?

164
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,516
Yep. Well at least,
that's what I'm hoping

165
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,553
that it'll turn into someday.
Now, to bed with ya.

166
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,054
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:48,108
Huh? Whoa!

168
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,411
The Judicial Ship is here!

169
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,346
What the heck is that?

170
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,549
A mobile court. I wonder
who they're here for.

171
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,022
Whaddaya think you're doing?

172
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:05,693
Let him go ya big stupid jerk!
He didn't do anything wrong.

173
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,129
Don't you worry.
I'll be just fine!

174
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:16,636
No Tom!! Come back!!!!

175
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,578
Justice was brought
to Gold Roger,

176
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:27,181
The King of the Pirates,
by way of execution!

177
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,651
His ship, the Oro Jackson, was
built by none other than Tom,

178
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,353
who stands before
this court today!

179
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:35,456
As penalty for aiding and
abetting that vicious criminal,

180
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,491
Tom will be taken
to Enies Lobby,

181
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,793
where he will be executed!

182
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,228
No!

183
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:02,549
The verdict was read! Guilty!
They're gonna execute Tom!

184
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,650
They say it's

185
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,053
because he built a ship
for the King of the Pirates.

186
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,221
Damn shame.

187
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,724
That thing brought a whole
lot of grief into the world.

188
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,726
Now, building ships
is not a crime.

189
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,796
And one may sell them to almost
anyone who wishes to buy.

190
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,300
But we must make an exception
for the King of the Pirates.

191
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,435
On the charge of providing
meaningful assistance

192
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,305
to the man who
terrorized the entire world.

193
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:28,709
We hereby sentence Tom
to death. Take him away!

194
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,611
Come on, time to go.

195
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,546
Move it! You heard him!

196
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,514
Hurry up!

197
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,415
Go already!

198
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:36,383
Hey, what're you doing?!

199
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,350
I've got a new design.

200
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,754
For a completely new
kind of paddle steamer!

201
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:45,092
A train that will run on the
surface of the ocean with gusto!

202
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,294
Shut up and get movin'!

203
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,731
This once great island
has lost its gusto.

204
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:55,202
Our trade is not what is used
to be. People have lost hope.

205
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,138
Water Seven is
slowly sinking away.

206
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,809
Every day our hard working
citizens are filled with worry.

207
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,111
I can lift their spirits.

208
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:09,015
I will by building our
good people a sea train!

209
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,254
Quit flappin' your gums
and move your feet.

210
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,588
No, let him stay.

211
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:15,522
Huh?

212
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,459
Sea train. Tell me more.

213
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:19,526
It's like a ship.

214
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,330
But one that puffs out
steam and runs on a track.

215
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,099
It'll go between the islands,

216
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,201
carrying people and
all kinds of goods.

217
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,702
Even other ships.

218
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:32,506
Most importantly, it won't be
affected by conditions at sea.

219
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,141
That's ridiculous!

220
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,410
A railway on the water
will be ripped to pieces

221
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:37,745
once Aqua Laguna comes around.

222
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:38,913
And even if it doesn't,

223
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,715
what're ya gonna do about
all the Sea Kings out there?

224
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,718
It doesn't have to be a
completely fixed track.

225
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,154
It'll be submerged
under the water a bit,

226
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,490
so it won't be
bombarded by the waves.

227
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:52,159
It'll sway just like
a rope in the water.

228
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,061
The sea train will
just use the tracks

229
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,430
as a guide to get
from place to place.

230
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,565
I'm also considering
installing a mechanism that

231
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,369
emits a loud dissonant sound
underwater to discourage fish

232
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,171
from getting anywhere
near the tracks.

233
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:06,273
It should work on
Sea Kings as well,

234
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,341
so they won't pose a threat.

235
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,743
Whoa, is all that possible?

236
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:14,181
If we connect St. Poplar, Pucci,
San Faldo and this island.

237
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,152
We can create a booming economy
that will help out all of us.

238
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,219
Amazing!

239
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,755
I will be finished with
the blueprints very soon.

240
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,692
But it will take a master
shipwright to build it.

241
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:27,561
Now could this sea train
run to Enies Lobby as well?

242
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,796
Without a doubt, your honor.

243
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:35,035
Once the plans are in the can
and the railway is in the water.

244
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,404
People can go with gusto
from island to island

245
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,605
for work or play!

246
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:43,611
And once again Water Seven
will be a city filled with hope!

247
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,312
How long will it take?

248
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,647
10 years.

249
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,182
Then build it!

250
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,517
If you agree to
develop this sea train,

251
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,419
I will give you
the time to do it.

252
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,622
Consider these next
ten years as probation!

253
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,692
That's great news!!

254
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,661
Good luck, Tom!

255
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,296
Save Water Seven, please!

256
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,038
I'm glad you think
this is so funny.

257
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,308
I thought you were a goner.
I was worried sick over you.

258
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,343
But I guess if this
plan of yours works out,

259
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,244
they're willing to forgive

260
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,280
and forget the whole
Gold Roger affair.

261
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,283
Mwell! I just gotta tell ya
how amazed I am with ya Tom!

262
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,418
What a great idea!
It's unbelievable!

263
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,687
To think that you just came
up with that on your own!

264
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,589
It's Brilliant! When you told--

265
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,324
Thanks for the grub!
Come on, Yokozuna!

266
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,492
I'll teach you the front crawl!

267
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:32,626
Erp!

268
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,262
Hey, we're all celebrating
here and you wanna leave?

269
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,263
What's your deal!?

270
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,400
My deal?! What happened
to Tom was so unfair!

271
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,168
He built the only
ship that was able

272
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,536
to sail the whole Grand Line!

273
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,538
Something no one else
in the world could do.

274
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,541
And those jerks wanna
put him to death over it?!

275
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,209
They don't realize
how hard that is!

276
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,811
They couldn't even
string together a raft

277
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,246
if their lives depended on it!

278
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,415
I mean, I know that the
whole reason our office

279
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,684
is under this bridge is
'cause those stupid people

280
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,719
kicked you out of
town over that ship!

281
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,487
You're the greatest
ship builder the world

282
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,056
has ever known and they
treat you like garbage!

283
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,493
What're ya laughin'
at ya big yellow weirdo?

284
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,530
You're crazy! Stop attacking
him, ya stupid kid!

285
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,399
Why does he have ta
laugh at everything?

286
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,638
No, no, no!
You're doin it wrong!

287
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,642
Stroke harder and
push that water back!

288
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,078
Erp! Erp!

289
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:27,047
No! No! Do it harder!
Don't hold back!

290
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,415
That Franky's got a lotta nerve.

291
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:31,185
If I were you, I'd kick
him out for what he just did!

292
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:33,254
Mwell, I know the boy
can be a handful,

293
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,722
but he's a fellow shipbuilder.

294
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:35,956
At his young age,

295
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,159
he's almost on par with the
best craftsmen on the island.

296
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,196
He does build battleships, yeah.

297
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,165
His problem is he's too honest.

298
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,609
Two years ago, I met that
kid on Scrap Heap Island.

299
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,312
He'd gone there to collect
junk to make a cannon,

300
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,748
and was firing it with gusto!

301
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,783
Old guy hey! Help me out.

302
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,552
My good-for-nothing
parents ditched me!

303
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,221
Apparently, his folks
couldn't handle

304
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,489
his rambunctious behavior,

305
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,457
so they threw
him off their ship.

306
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,360
Sounds like a couple of
heartless pirates to me, eh?

307
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,829
What a joke.

308
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,097
Now, Tom.

309
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,133
He is one tough kid.

310
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,169
He's had a rough go at it,
but he's still got a good heart.

311
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,738
I'm positive that both of
you boys are gonna grow up

312
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,141
to be world-class
shipwrights some day.

313
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,676
There's no need
for you to be rivals.

314
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,477
I don't know about all that.

315
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,813
It's like he's allergic
to sanity or something.

316
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,749
Mwell. I just need to
finish those blueprints

317
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,718
and then we'll build
ourselves a sea train!

318
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:41,322
Yeah. I bet he
won't help at all.

319
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,623
He can do whatever he wants!

320
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,057
Suicide?

321
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,659
That's the word. Head of
the fourth largest shipyard.

322
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,295
What a tragic story.

323
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,497
They ran out of materials
so he took a ship out

324
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,768
to sea to get some more.
Lost fifty men on the water.

325
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,671
They had to close down his shop.

326
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,774
Aw man. Will this
be how it ends?

327
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,211
Is this how Water
Seven finally dies?

328
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:50,150
Hey! Did you guys hear?
Big news from Scrap Heap Island!

329
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,586
No way! Did they do it!?

330
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,457
Did Tom's Workers actually
finish the sea train?!

331
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,660
Whoa! Is this crazy
thing really gonna work?

332
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:02,429
I don't know if I trust
something built by a criminal.

333
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,330
I'll try it out!

334
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,832
What the heck, me too!

335
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,667
They gonna tell us
how it works?!

336
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,202
All aboard ladies and gentlemen!

337
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:17,010
There it goes!

338
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:21,715
The paddles are
grabbing the railway!

339
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,651
Man that is the
coolest thing ever!

340
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,198
Twelve years ago,
departing from an isolated city

341
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,301
in decline and full of

342
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:44,170
passengers who'd almost given
up hope for a brighter future.

343
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,112
The sea train
"Puffing Tom" embarked

344
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,514
on its maiden voyage
across the sea!

345
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:16,130
So this is the home of your
dearest memories with Tom.

346
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,465
I'm telling ya, I ain't
got the blueprints!

347
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,532
You're wasting your time!

348
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,202
Well seeing as you're a
criminal just like he was,

349
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,039
you shouldn't be surprised when
you meet the same grim fate!

350
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,308
You don't know anything
about the real Tom!

351
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,109
So shut your damn mouth!

352
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:32,179
On the next One Piece:
"Spandam's Scheme!

353
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,114
The Day the Sea Train Shook."

354
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,516
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
