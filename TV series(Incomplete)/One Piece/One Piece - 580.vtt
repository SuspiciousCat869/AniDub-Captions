00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.537
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.440
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.243
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.512
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.748
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.550
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.853
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:22.922
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.358
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:30.397
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:39.726
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.695
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:47.767
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.436
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.706
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.608
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.944
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.747
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.750
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:06.953
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.690
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.894
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.099
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.602
the Straw Hat Pirates
depart for the deadly waters

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.539
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.208
That's not what
the volcano says!

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.109
The island is right there!

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.978
Who cares about
some dumb needles?

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:35.949
Hey. This is weird.
They don't normally cry.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:39.118
What's wrong, buddy?
Does your stomach hurt?

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.454
No. That's a distress signal.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.456
Someone close by
is calling for help.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.491
If I pick it up,
can I hear them?

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:46.626
Wait, Luffy!

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.628
More than half of
those calls are fake.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.163
This is likely just a trap.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.932
[RANDOM MAN 579A sobs]
Someone help!

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.636
My friends are getting
cut down one after another!

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.472
The samurai is gonna kill us!

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:00.506
The what now?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.576
Wait up. Who? Samurai?
And where are you?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.144
[RANDOM MAN 579A sobs]
Please hurry!

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:08.848
We're on the island
of Punk Hazard!

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.451
We don't have much time left!

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.956
[ROBIN]
Well, that settles it.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.758
This is where
the call came from.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.194
[USOPP]
He said "Punk Hazard" for sure.

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:27.200
[USOPP panting]

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.338
[ROBIN] It's not so bad.
Those aren't houses.

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.675
Clearly, they're some sort of
government research facilities.

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:40.880
It's behind us. Huh?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.718
My goodness.

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.861
[screams]

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:59.365
Oh, wow. Those things
are real? Crazy!

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:00.867
No way.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.236
Whatever this is,
it must be a trick.

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.204
Those things're
only in fairy tales.

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.174
And yet just look at it.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.543
What else could it possibly be?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.861
[LUFFY] "A Battle in the Heat!
Luffy VS. the Giant Dragon!"

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:42.275
Whoa. So cool!

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:51.184
[LUFFY laughs]
That's awesome!

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:54.921
Yeah? You think
getting eaten is cool?

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:59.025
[DRAGON 579A roars]

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.460
[LUFFY]
Check him out, everybody!

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:01.928
[USOPP]
No thank you!

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.096
[DRAGON 579A growling]

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.264
[LUFFY]
Dude, he growls and everything!

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:08.701
[LUFFY laughing]

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.938
[LUFFY]
How badass is this?

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.439
Huh?

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:15.975
[KIN'EMON]
Who goes there?

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.443
Huh?

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.452
[ALL gasp]

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:30.289
[USOPP gasping]

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.826
[screams] Please don't eat me!

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:43.936
Hey, what the hell was that for?

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.771
[LUFFY]
Listen!

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:45.671
Huh?

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:48.241
He was talking! I heard him!

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:51.177
[USOPP] Bah! I think the
heat's getting to you, pal.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.779
[LUFFY]
I dunno.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.518
M-Maybe it isn't even a dragon.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.988
It could be something
way more dangerous!

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:05.191
It sure looks like
one though, doesn't it?

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.994
It does. That's
a dragon for sure.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:10.363
A lizard-like body
with massive wings.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:13.733
That's exactly the way dragons
are described in all the myths.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.143
--Whoa.
--Uh-oh.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:29.182
Run away!

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:43.029
[LUFFY gasps, laughs]

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:58.244
So it can breathe fire, too?

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:00.680
[LUFFY cheering]

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:06.619
I don't know what I was
expecting, but come on, really?

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:10.089
[chuckles] Bring it on.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:12.158
[gasps]

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.993

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:18.030
[roars]

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.568
I'm not letting you
have all the fun!

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.440
Second Gear!

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:32.712
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.383
[LUFFY]
...Jet Bullet!

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:48.060
Oh no!

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:51.264
Huh? You got some
thick skin, huh?

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.466
[gasps]

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.801
Look! Behind you!

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:57.270
[LUFFY gasps]

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.611
Whoa!

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:12.552
[DRAGON 579A growls]

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:15.154
[USOPP shrieks]
It sees us!

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.989
You're mine!

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:21.994
Knock it off,
you're making it angry!

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:23.329
[USOPP gasps]

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.838
[KIN'EMON] Poot!
I can sense your presence!

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.739
[ZORO gasps]

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:35.308
[USOPP gasps]

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:49.355
Oh, I see now.

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:52.558
Luffy was right.
That thing really can talk!

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.901
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style!

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.871
[roars]

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.808
[ZORO]
Ultra Tiger Trap!

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:20.019
[roars]

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.222
[ZORO gasps]

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.603
[ZORO] Damn it! This guy
is one stubborn lizard!

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:48.180
[LUFFY growls]

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:50.449
Back off!

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:03.929
[ZORO]
Luffy!

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.498
Huh?

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:08.067
[ZORO]
I heard him talk, too.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.901
I told ya!

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:12.104
Yeah, I heard it, too! But how?

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:20.312
[roaring]

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:24.784
[USOPP gasps]

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:35.895
[LUFFY, ZORO gasp]

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:38.330
Oh, great, now he's flying!

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:47.807
[gasps] That's crazy!

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:55.481
[KIN'EMON] Poot! Are you also
allies of the Seven Warlords?

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:58.951
[ALL gasp]

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:00.252
I don't follow.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.655
Yeah, what are you
talkin' about?

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.226
[ALL gasp]

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.494
He's breathing fire again.

00:12:08.527 --> 00:12:11.664
No time to run!
We're as good as fried!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.133
[USOPP]
Running anyway!

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:22.341
[USOPP screaming]

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:37.757
[panting]

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.458
[sighs]

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.163
[sighs]

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:46.632
[ALL]
I'm burning up!

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:52.638
[SANJI humming]

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:54.940
[SANJI]
Just you wait, Nami.

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:58.410
I'll make you a dessert
as sweet as you are!

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.521
Oh! I know!

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:12.057
All we need to do is adjust
our perspective, everyone!

00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.259
You see?

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.695
If you pretend you're in a
sauna, the heat feels lovely!

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.834
[sighs] Man, it's
so hot out here,

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:24.570
I'm startin' to
super sweat cola!

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.086
[NAMI]
How weird.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.191
The sky above the
island is split in two.

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.160
Half is hot and
half is freezing.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.395
I wonder why?

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:53.399
[CHOPPER]
I hope the others don't melt.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:12.284
[NAMI]
Huh? What was that?

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:18.691
You okay?

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:21.927
I feel... faint.

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.730
I'm lightheaded, too.

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:29.969
Perhaps I'm dying again. Ugh.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.404
Oh, crap.

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:36.542
Are my cola levels getting
too low or something?

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:37.376
[FRANKY groans]

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:39.245
[CHOPPER]
Wh-What's happening?

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:44.817
Huh? Not me, too...

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:39.271
[USOPP panting]

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.307

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:48.147
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:55.054
[USOPP] Ugh. It's hot.
And worse than that...

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:57.022
Talking dragon!

00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:05.965
[pants] He mentioned
the Seven Warlords.

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:08.400
So could he be
an enemy of theirs?

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:14.006
[USOPP gasps]
It's melting!

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.908
[panting]

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:18.510
[panting]

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.390
Luffy. Just leave
this blowhard to me.

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:35.728
I'll cut him to
pieces in no time.

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:42.067
Sure. Go ahead. But first...

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.936
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.241
Let me bring him to ya!

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.478
[LUFFY]
Heh.

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:57.383
[LUFFY gasps]

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.453
[LUFFY groans]

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:08.093
It feels like he's
on fire, too! [gasps]

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:17.603
Huh?

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.472
[KIN'EMON]
Poot!

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:24.410
I feel a breeze all of
a sudden, how curious!

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.778
Huh?!

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:29.114
[KIN'EMON] The flames are
nipping at my tender flesh!

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:34.620
[KIN'EMON] Ah! Have mercy!
That tickles! Poot!

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:37.756
[BOTH laughing]

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.794
[KIN'EMON] Stand down!
Such dishonorable behavior!

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:44.596
Ha! I was right!

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.733
Hey, guys! You won't
believe this!

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:51.670
There's some weird fancy-pants
guy stuck in the dragon's back!

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:54.773
Huh? What the hell
is he talking about?

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:57.276
That means the voice we've
been hearing must be...

00:17:57.309 --> 00:17:58.277
[gasps]

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.612
[roars]

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:01.680
[LUFFY gasps]

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.283
[LUFFY gasps]

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:08.754
[roars]

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:11.190
All right, that's enough!

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:15.928
Eat this if you're hungry!

00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:19.131
[LUFFY yells]

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.702
[chuckles]

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:36.648
[chuckles] Stupid!

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:46.024
Hey! Heads up!

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.599
[ZORO]
Usopp!

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.702
You got it!

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.337
Special Attack.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.938
Green Star!

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.510
[USOPP]
Trampolia!

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.659
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style.

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:22.628
[DRAGON 579A growls]

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:26.932
[roars]

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:28.534
[ZORO]
Iai.

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:37.976
[ZORO]
Death Lion Song! You're done!

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:50.856
[USOPP laughs]
Yeah! Zoro!

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.558
[ZORO chuckles]

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.494
[laughs]

00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.132
[LUFFY]
I bet this thing is delicious!

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.601
[ZORO] There's enough fire
around to barbecue it.

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.736
[LUFFY]
Now you're talkin'!

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.039
[laughs]

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:09.441
Here! Cien Fleurs!

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.745
[LUFFY giggles]

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.627
[SANJI]
Nami swan!

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.631
A cold crepe to go with
the shellfish, just for you!

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:36.335
I got some champagne, too-- Huh?

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:40.505
[SANJI]
Uh, are you guys sleeping?

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.813
[snoring]

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.656
It's foggy.

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.397
[SANJI]
That's not fog.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:09.134
[SANJI] Damn, I already
inhaled some of it.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.336
It's some kind of sleeping gas.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.506
Is this just a normal
occurrence in the New World?

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:19.077
[SANJI] Or did somebody
sneak onto the ship?

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.848
[SANJI] I hope the
rest of the crew took

00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:26.218
a baby transponder snail
to the island with them.

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:35.193
[SANJI] I have to find
a way to tell them.

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:29.915
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
We've got two humans,

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:34.453
one cyborg,
and some sort of pet.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:39.758
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
Tie them all up!

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.593
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES]
Right!

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.095
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
It's a good thing they're just

00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.964
lowlife pirates.

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:50.802
So no one's even going to
miss them. How convenient.

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:07.119
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 580A]
The master will be

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:09.287
pleased with this.

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.397
[NARRATOR] Luffy and
his friends rescue a man

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.899
from the dragon's flames,
but the crew is astomished

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:24.269
when they notice something
surprising about his appearance.

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:25.670
Elsewhere on the island,

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:28.340
Sanji and his cohorts are
abducted and find themselves

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.642
locked inside a strange area.

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.811
Once there, the team
stumbles upon something

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.613
they never could have predicted.

00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:36.314
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:38.016
"The Straw Hats Stunned!

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:41.186
Enter: A Samurai's
Horrifying Severed Head!"

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:43.889
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
