Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

Right now, we're rowing straight toward

The borderline between the sky and the ocean

In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,764
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,836
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,706
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42

I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,882
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46

This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

searched for a coating mechanic,

49
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,197
Camie was kidnapped
in Sabaody Park.

50

Some jerk's gotta go
and bring a mermaid in

51

at the last minute
before the auction starts!

52

Hold on!

53
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,371
Now who brought in the mermaid?

learned she had been taken

to arrive on the scene.

As the auction continued,
Luffy and the rest of the crew

raced to the grove
to rescue their friend

61
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,656
before she was condemned
to a life of slavery.

It's incredible!

69
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,350
Her starting price
of 800,000 berries

70
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,687
has skyrocketed to the winning
bid of 7.2 million berries!

I've finally arrived.

While that may be true, sir,

80
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,615
I believe I just heard him say
they were on entry number 15,

81
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,318
which would mean the
auction is almost over.

82
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,720
Because this oaf
was slow getting here.

[ATTENDANT 393A] I'll make
the arrangements at once.

A Celestial Dragon.

Another one, huh?

89
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,574
Lots of nobility here.

90
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,877
And a Navy Admiral will
come running to the rescue

91
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,245
if we defy one of 'em.

92
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,681
What I really want
to buy is a mermaid.

93
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,749
I do hope they
have one this time.

94
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,885

96
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,323

He bit off his tongue.

He decided he'd rather die
than live as someone's pet.

than to take his own life.

00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,130
What are you trying to pull?

178
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,965
[BOUNTY HUNTER 396B] No, no, no!
Nothing of the sort, I swear!

179
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,633
You asked for
directions to grove 1

180
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,801
and that's what we gave you!

181
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,136
We were more than happy to help!

182
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,904
[ZORO]
Then why were you running away?

183
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,639
[BOUNTY HUNTER 396A] Because
you gave us such a scary look,

184
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,841
and you beat us up so bad
last time we saw you!

185
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,143
Huh?

00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,779
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

187
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,114
We gotta get to grove number 1!

Hurry! Get on!

00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,920
[ZORO]
Wait, dammit!

190
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,956
Ugh, not this again!

What the heck do you
think you're doing, kid?

192
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,699
My bad.

193
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,604

gonna cut you right in half.

I said, "My bad".

[FISH RIDER 386A]
Whatever.

Let's just get
to grove number 1!

197
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,012
[DISCO] It seems entry number
16, the pirate captain Lacuba,

198
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,680
was so nervous to see you all

199

that he collapsed
from a nosebleed.

200
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,317
His auction will have to wait.

We apologize for

What a load of crap.

But ladies and gentlemen!

00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:29,228
The next item I have to show you
is nothing short of incredible!

[drumroll]

210
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,230
This item is far too
amazing to reveal all at once,

211
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,731
so we'll take it in steps.

212
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,700
Observe the silhouette!

00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,204

Could it really be?

214
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,172
[RICH PATRON 396D]
Yes, it is!

215

Did that whet your appetite?

00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,943
Well try not to drool, folks,

comes the real deal!

[BIDDERS cheering]

00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:40,266
[DISCO] All the way from Fishman
Island, the mermaid Camie!

223
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,234
It's real! A young mermaid!

224
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,703
She's incredible!

225
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,271
What an amazing find!

00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,048
It's Hachin and the Straw Hats!

They must've come
here to rescue me!

00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,420
They're selling her!
Do something!

I'm on it.

231
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,123
We'll get her back no problem.

232
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,625
200 million is gonna
be more than enough.

233
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,094
Camie!

234
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,429
I can't believe it! A mermaid!

235

They're selling a mermaid!

236
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,969
[DISCO] I see there's a lot
of interest in this item.

237
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,073
It is our first mermaid in
quite some time, after all!

238
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,007
Now then.

239
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,977
At what price should
we start the bidding?

240
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,683
[NAMI]
Whatever it is, I'll top it!

241

We're not leaving
here without you, Camie.

242

Let's get this
show on the road!

243
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,324
We'll start at...

244
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,992
[CHARLOSS]
500 million!

245
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,839
I bid 500 million!

246
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,194
Whoa. So much.

247
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,899
It's useless.
I can't compete with that.

248
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,370
How could this happen?

249
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,971
We don't have nearly that much!

250
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,406
What a waste of money.

251
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,708
Did you forget the
piranhas in your aquarium?

252
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,477
She won't last an hour in there.

253
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,046
It'll be fun to
watch her try, though.

254
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,250
Merfolk are the fastest swimmers
in the world, or so they say.

255
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,054
[CAMIE] I can't hear anything
they're saying out there.

[DISCO] Everyone appears
to be at a loss for words,

263
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,240
but I'll ask just the same.

264
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:39,245
Does anyone out there have a bid
higher than 500 million berries?

265
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,381
Can't we do
anything about this?

266
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,450
I mean, there's gotta
be something, right?

267
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,285

There isn't any time left!

If we don't do something now,

271
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,226
they'll take her away
and we'll never get her back!

272
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,294
This is bad.

273
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,297
We should've known we
couldn't compete with them.

Those creeps throw money
around like it grows on trees.

275

This just isn't our game.

If not, then I'll bring the
bidding straight to a close.

I'll have to help her escape
to the ocean by force!

Don't be stupid!

282
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,282
What about the collar? Do you
want her head to explode?

283
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,516
Well, then I...

284
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,486
I guess I'm just gonna have to
find a way to get the key, too!

351
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,924
We don't want you here!

352
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,932
Hachi! We need
to run for it!

353
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,634
You're the one
who's in danger now!

354
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,003
You telling me to
let Camie go? No way!

355
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,639
Why do the people
here hate him so much?

356
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,542
It's just like
Robin said before.

357
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,811
They discriminate against
fishmen and merfolk

358
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,979
on these islands.

359
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,781
They hate every
last one of them.

360
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,015
But why?

361
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,384
They're not any
different from us!

362
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,723
[gunshot]

363
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,924
[PAPPAGU]
Hachi. Are you--

364
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,866
[CHARLOSS]
I did it! I shot it!

365
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,002
I took down a fishman!

366
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,103
Hachi!

367
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,207
Thank goodness someone shot it.

368
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,442
If that awful sea beast
had gotten any closer,

369
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,777
it would have made us all ill!

370
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,745
True.

371
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,046
And it was definitely
plotting something.

372
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,181
Couldn't have been much, though.

373
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,750
Even if it can walk, it's
still got a fish's brain.

374
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,529
[CHARLOSS] Look, father!
I got a fishman!

375
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,932
I shot it and caught it
all by myself!

376
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,768
That means I can
have it for free!

377
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,469
It's free! It's free!

378
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,904
An octopus for me!

379
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,606
I caught a fishman by myself!

380
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,107
An octopus for free!

381
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,742
What a deal! What a deal!

382
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,144
An octo-slave for free!

383
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,780
Free, free, free, free, free!

384
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,153
Wait. Straw Hat...

385
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,557
Don't do this.

386
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,261
[HACHI]
It's my fault.

387
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,131
I'm the one who
screwed up, okay?

388
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,942
Please don't
forget your promise.

389
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,645
Like I said, you can't
defy the Celestial Dragons,

390
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,614
even if they kill someone!

391
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,785
[HACHI] There was a time
when I was a pirate.

392
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,754
A criminal.

393
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,023
This is the punishment I deserve

394
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,959
for doing all of
those horrible things.

395
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,798
[HACHI]
I'm so sorry.

396
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,168
I didn't mean for everything
to turn out like this.

397
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:19,144
I just wanted to make amends
with Nami however I could.

398
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,781
Even if it wasn't much,

399
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,717
I wanted to be helpful
to you and your crew.

400
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,722
But I screwed that up, I guess.

401
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,824
Just like every other time.

402
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,031
I wanted to do
something right for once.

403
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,067
And show Nami how sorry I am.

404
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,536
[NAMI]
Hachi!

405
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,072
All my life,

406
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,541
all I've ever done
is cause trouble.

407
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

408
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,250
That's enough!

409
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,719
Stop all that annoying
babbling, fish!

410
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,888
Before I shut you up for good!

411
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,592
How dare you.

412
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,227
Don't look at me like that.

413
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,270
[PAPPAGU]
Don't! Straw Hat, please!

414
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,743
You're gonna get in really
big trouble! Don't do it!

415
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,014
Easy! You see this?

416
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,688
What is that man doing?
He's crazy!

417
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,790
Straw Hat Luffy.

418
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,258
He's serious.

419
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,864
Now you're
annoying me, too!

420
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,899
[gunshots]

421
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,628
[USOPP] I can see it!
The auction house!

422
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,064
[BROOK] There are throngs of
people surrounding the place!

423
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,966
I predict a big battle
in our future!

424
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,334
[USOPP] That can only
mean one thing!

425
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,769
Luffy and the others
are stirring up

426
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:24,803
a whole world of trouble!

427
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,773
[BROOK] We must rush
to their aid! Ready? Charge!

428
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,341
[USOPP]
I don't wanna!

429
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,076
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

430
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,679
"Major Panic! Desperate
Struggle at the Auction House!"

431
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,115
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
