1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,320
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,690
As we dash by like a noisy party
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

the Pirates, attained this
As we dash by like a noisy party

40
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:39,700
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,280
Make some waves...
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,590
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,860
and everything else
the world had to offer.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,870
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,030
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,100
You can have it!

47
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

48
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,440
Now you just have to find it!

49
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,880
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,880
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,120
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

52
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,690
[LUFFY] Well? Come on!
Get on my ship!

53
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,420
Captain's orders.

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,760
"Your" ship already, huh?

55
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,460
What can I say?
You don't leave me much choice.

56
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,800
I gotta take care of my
masterpiece, after all!

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,070
So set sail!
I'm joining the crew!

58
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,700
[USOPP]
Hey! You should be happy!

59
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,570
Your friend Usopp's back!

60
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,440
Sure, we had a little
disagreement, but we're friends!

61
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,940
And friends can put the
past behind them, right?

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,420
[USOPP]
You're serious, aren't you?

63
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,120
[USOPP] Fine,
you've made your decision.

64
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,720
If that's how it is, then I have
only one thing to say to you.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,930
I'm sorry!

66
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,600
I'm too stubborn, I know!

67
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,600
I take back every word I said!

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,000
That's more like it.

69
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,140
[USOPP] Luffy...

70
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,650
Hurry up! Grab on already!

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,620
[sobbing]

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,090
[ICEBERG] It might not be my
place, but I have a suggestion.

73
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,260
Why don't you call this
ship... The Thousand Sunny!

74
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,130
[FRANKY] Coup de Burst!

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,810
[FRANKY] It eats up
three barrels of cola,

76
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,840
but it can fly for
a whole kilometer.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,210
I'm not trying to brag here,
but simply put,

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,050
anything the
Going Merry could do,

79
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,980
this ship can do better.

80
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,650
And it's got tricks of its own.

81
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,880
But even if it's all new,

82
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,720
I hope the brave spirit of the
Merry can live on in the Sunny.

83
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,990
[ALL]
Yeah!

84
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,830
Everybody raise a glass

85
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,860
for the return of our old
friends Robin and Usopp,

86
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,670
as well as our new
crewmember, Franky,

87
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,870
and the best ship ever,
the Thousand Sunny!

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,870
Let's hear it for our crew!

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,040
[ALL] Cheers!

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,540
[LUFFY] Let's go!

91
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,310
Next stop, Fishman Island!

92
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,240
[ALL] Yeah!

93
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,100
[PUZZLE] Stop!

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,900
Vigaro! No!

95
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,550
[CAMPACINO] Papa!

96
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,850
Are you staring
at your collection

97
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,280
all by yourself again?

98
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,190
[ACCINO]
Ah! Good. You're all back.

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,420
That was fast.

100
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,590
[CAMPACINO] We have important
arrangements to make, after all.

101
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,060
We're working to
make sure tomorrow

102
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,890
is a very special
birthday, Papa.

103
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,810
[STANSEN]
Time to change shifts, Jiro.

104
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,910
Go get some rest.

105
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,580
It's my turn to
look after the captain.

106
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,150
[LUFFY] The Mysterious
Band of Pirates!

107
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,880
Sunny and the Dangerous Trap!

108
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
[NAMI] If this is a dream,
I don't wanna wake up!

109
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,840
Taking a hot bath while the
waves gently rock the boat.

110
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,910
This is the life!

111
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,240
[CHOPPER] An office!

112
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,680
I have my very own
doctor's office!

113
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,180
[laughing]

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,850
"What's wrong, Chopper?"
Nothing at all!

115
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,310
[laughing]

116
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,250
Hurry up and bring me patients!

117
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,290
The doctor is in!

118
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,350
[LUFFY] Got 'em!

119
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,760
Look! We caught a cool shark!

120
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,990
Put it in! Put it in!

121
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,790
Put it in the fish tank!

122
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,430
[USOPP]
Yeah!

123
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,660
[LUFFY]
All right! In you go!

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
Seems we have a new guest.

125
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,200
A shark.

126
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,770
So, this room
perfect, or what?

127
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,810
[SANJI] The room's fine,

128
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,040
but don't those idiots
know a shark's a bad idea?

129
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,980
Hurry up! Let's go see it!

130
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,010
The other fish
are gonna love this!

131
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,810
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Hey!

132
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,050
[LUFFY] Can you
see the shark yet?

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,980
He's the one with the big horns!

134
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,320
[ROBIN] Yes.
It's an impressive specimen.

135
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,320
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
to play very well with others.

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
[screaming]

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,290
What did you think
was gonna happen?!

138
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't you know how the
food chain works, you idiot?!

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
[LUFFY] Stupid shark!

140
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,900
I'm gonna eat you
for doing that!

141
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,840
Sanji! Turn this bastard
into a BBQ dinner!

142
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,340
[SANJI] You can't
barbecue everything!

143
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,740
This is a fresh fish
we're talking about.

144
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,840
He could be sushi.

145
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,080
Or we could boil him and
add some spicy vinegar miso.

146
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,380
Maybe even shark tempura.

147
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,980
[LUFFY] Let's make all of them!

148
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,420
[yawning]

149
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,050
[LUFFY] This ship is amazing!

150
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,420
Thanks for making
it so awesome, Franky.

151
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,420
[FRANKY] It is
pretty awesome, isn't it?

152
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,930
But what you've seen so far
isn't even the best part!

153
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,490
I've got lots more to show you!

154
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,860
You do? Like what?

155
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,900
[FRANKY] I'll tell ya!

156
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,200
One of its greatest features

157
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,330
is called the
Soldier Dock System.

158
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,200
The bottom of the
ship is equipped with

159
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,370
five docking stations
numbered from zero to four.

160
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,170
Each dock has
something unique to offer

161
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,380
depending on the situation.

162
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,250
So no matter what trouble
you get the Thousand Sunny into,

163
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,210
I guarantee we got a solution.

164
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,210
Cool!

165
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,720
Show 'em to me! Show 'em to me!

166
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,920
[FRANKY] All in due time!

167
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,020
When the situation calls for it,
you'll see 'em in action.

168
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,720
If I showed you all of 'em now,
it'd spoil the surprise!

169
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,860
--Boo! Boo! Boo!

170
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,130
--I look forward to it!
--Boo! Boo! Boo!

171
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,030
Ah! That was
just what I needed.

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,410
[NAMI] We've had a sudden drop
in temperature since yesterday.

173
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,240
I wonder...

174
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,310
I guess we're getting pretty
close to a winter island.

175
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,750
But it's odd that Kokoro didn't
mention anything about that.

176
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,490
It's snowing.

177
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,460
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Look, guys! Snow!

178
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,960
[LUFFY]
Zoro, what's wrong with you?

179
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,330
You're a terrible lookout!

180
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,400
If it starts snowing,
you need to do this!

181
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,100
Attention, all hands!
Attention, all hands!

182
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,270
It's snowing!
I repeat! It's snowing!

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,940
[LUFFY] I wonder if he
even noticed the snow.

184
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,300
What a moron!

185
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,940
[USOPP, LUFFY]
Zoro, the idiot!

186
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,270
You know, there's
something wrong with the world

187
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,940
when a pair of nitwits like that

188
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,110
can get away with
calling me an idiot.

189
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,410
Look at that!

190
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,180
It's been a long time!

191
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,450
It's beautiful!

192
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,980
I hope it piles up high!

193
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,150
I should probably prepare us
something warm for dinner.

194
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,880
[ZORO] Hey! I see a ship!

195
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,950
There's something
strange about it, too!

196
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,120
Really? Where is it?

197
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,290
Strange is right!

198
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,120
As far as I can tell, it
doesn't have a sail or a flag!

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,460
It doesn't have a sail?

200
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,460
So it's just sitting there,
drifting around?

201
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,130
An abandoned ship?

202
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,200
Or maybe--

203
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,300
I've heard stories of a
strange game between pirates

204
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,200
that takes away crew members
called a Davy Back Fight.

205
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,040
Yeah. We know.

206
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,070
But wait,

207
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,970
does that mean they
took the crew's flag, too?

208
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,210
Whoa, wait a minute.
I see someone!

209
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,850
[USOPP] They're fishing?

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,920
Then they might be castaways.
Pretty ragged and tired looking.

211
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,180
What do ya think, Captain?

212
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,090
Right! Let's go take a look!

213
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,490
If they're enemies,
we'll just beat 'em up!

214
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,510
You know, I don't really see the
point in trying to catch fish

215
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,240
when we don't have any bait.

216
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,010
Come on.
Don't be so negative.

217
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,350
It's not like we have
anything better to do.

218
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,920
Just have a little patience.

219
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,020
Who knows what
could happen, you know?

220
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,360
[LUFFY] Hey! Are you
guys okay over there?

221
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,300
They're pirates!
Pirates are here!

222
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,430
What'd you say?

223
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,870
[LAGO] Run for it!

224
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,200
[TROFF] There's no wind!

225
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,410
[RACE] We don't
have a sail, anyway!

226
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,380
[FISHERMEN] We surrender!
Spare our lives!

227
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,540
[ALL]
Huh?

228
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,210
Okay...?

229
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,120
Oh, man.

230
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,820
Your ship's in even worse
shape than you guys are!

231
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,320
Looks like you took a beating!

232
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,490
[LUFFY] Who are you, and what
are you doing out here?

233
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,400
[RACE] Oh, uh, we're just
a bunch of fishermen,

234
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,560
down on our luck!

235
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,070
[FRANKY] You're fishermen?

236
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,300
[RACE] Yeah.

237
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,400
We were minding our own business
when our ship was attacked!

238
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,600
That was three days ago.

239
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,440
They stole all our food,
destroyed the helm and sails,

240
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,280
took all of our valuables,
and then left us here to die!

241
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,580
We were stranded!

242
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,110
[LAGO] So if you're
here to attack us,

243
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,580
there's nothing left to take.

244
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,320
Don't worry.
We're not here for that.

245
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,850
You guys must be
pretty hungry, right?

246
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
We're planning on
having dinner soon.

247
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,190
Why don't you all
come on over and join us?

248
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,020
What? Seriously?

249
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,990
Are you sure?

250
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
[LUFFY] Yeah!

251
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,960
Our cook would never ignore
people as hungry as you guys.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,260
Eat all you want to!

253
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,430
Hey! Sanji!

254
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,270
Is it ready yet? We're starving!

255
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,500
Almost!
Just a few more minutes!

256
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,270
But before all of that...

257
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,440
Hey, Chopper!

258
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
How about checking
these guys over

259
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,940
to help break in
that new office?

260
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,850
Yeah. Sure.

261
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,220
[CHOPPER] If anyone's
injured or feeling sick,

262
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,950
come along with me!

263
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,020
Is there anybody
on board who can't move?

264
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,220
Holy crap!
Their pet can talk!

265
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,490
I'm not a pet!

266
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm a pirate, you got that?

267
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,160
I've got a bounty of
50 Berries! 50 Berries...

268
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,130
Please. Don't move.

269
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,350
[STANSEN]
I don't recognize their flag.

270
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,990
Maybe they're some
rookie pirates

271
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,920
coming from a faraway sea.

272
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,190
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

273
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,190
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

274
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,260
[STANSEN] Yes?

275
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,260
[SALCHOW] It's me. How are
things going over there?

276
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,160
[STANSEN] Oh! Fine, fine.

277
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,700
We just came across
a pirate ship.

278
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,700
Though, they don't seem
very aggressive for pirates.

279
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,000
[SALCHOW] Heh!
So what's their flag like?

280
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,010
[STANSEN] Let's see...

281
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,240
It looks like a skull
wearing a straw hat.

282
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
[SALCHOW] What was that?

283
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,180
[STANSEN] It's like
taking candy from a baby.

284
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,280
These bunch of rookies couldn't
have made it any easier for us.

285
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,690
[SALCHOW] Stop joking around!
This is serious!

286
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

287
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,590
[SALCHOW] Now listen!

288
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,020
That crew of "rookies"
is the Straw Hat Pirates!

289
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,630
They have a collective bounty
of over 600 million Berries!

290
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,230
[STANSEN]
600... million?

291
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,700
[SALCHOW] Yes, that's right!

292
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,530
[SALCHOW]
You know the plan, don't you?

293
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,370
Everyone knows what to do?

294
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,370
Yes. I think we're good.

295
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,570
[SALCHOW]
Listen! No matter what,

296
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,370
do not let them escape
before we get there!

297
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,310
Got it?

298
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

299
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,080
A bounty of 600 million?

300
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,270
[RACE] Delicious!

301
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,570
This food is amazing,
Mr. Eyebrows Cook!

302
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,310
[TROFF] It's so good,
I can't stop the tears!

303
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,180
Crybabies. Geez.

304
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,780
And lovely
pirate ladies, too!

305
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,450
Whoa, you're right!

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,420
They're so beautiful,
I can't stop the tears!

307
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,020
It seems you're right.

308
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,290
Well, I wish they
wouldn't cry so loud.

309
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,770
[JIRO]
Excuse me!

310
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,770
What's wrong?

311
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,340
Don't you want to eat?
You must be starving!

312
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,770
What is it?

313
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,140
[JIRO] Doctor! Listen!
I'm begging you!

314
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,640
[JIRO] After seeing
how skilled you are,

315
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,110
there's someone else I
need you to take a look at!

316
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,680
Please, come!

317
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,350
He's onboard our ship
and really needs your help!

318
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,070
[RACE] What?
You're headed for the New World?

319
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,410
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!

320
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,380
I won't go into details,
but that place is hell!

321
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,210
Huh? Hey, wait.

322
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,310
You mean you guys
have been there?

323
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,720
Uh... No!

324
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,480
We've just heard about it.

325
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,850
Stories from other sailors.

326
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,490
They said it was
a terrible place!

327
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,320
Idiots!

328
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,160
I don't care about
stories like that.

329
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,060
We won't know for sure if
it's hell or not unless we go!

330
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,740
What was that?

331
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,410
Oh! Hey there, friend!

332
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,110
You really saved us
with that food,

333
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,540
so I wanted to do something
in return to thank you!

334
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,340
My name's Stansen.

335
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,110
And under
current circumstances,

336
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,680
I'm acting as Captain.

337
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,450
It's a special drink we
save for times like this.

338
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,690
Enjoy yourselves!

339
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,190
Thanks!

340
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,810
[CHOPPER] Is there really a
patient for me way down here?

341
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,450
[CHOPPER] I don't like this.

342
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,550
Where the heck is he taking me?

343
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,780
Is--Is that him?

344
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,480
[JIRO] Yeah.

345
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,180
He was wounded, and we
don't have a doctor.

346
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,190
He's been shaking
in pain like this for days.

347
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,850
Please, Doctor! Do something!

348
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,150
Help him!

349
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,930
[CHOPPER]
This wound looks horrible!

350
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,260
Why wasn't it stitched up?

351
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,460
How could you
let it get this bad?

352
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,970
There was nothing we could do.

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,940
We can't move him
in this condition.

354
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll have to operate
right here and now!

355
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,350
Man, you are a
strange bunch of guys!

356
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,610
[USOPP] Seriously!

357
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,480
You don't have anything to eat,
but you got tons of this stuff?

358
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,450
[STANSEN] Yeah, well...

359
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,450
Anyway, this food is great!

360
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,290
We were lucky to run
into you guys when we did!

361
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,460
Especially...

362
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,390
...way out here!

363
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,490
--It's no big deal.
--[STANSEN] But it is!

364
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,660
If we could only go back
to where we came from,

365
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,630
we'd be able to give you
a better reward than this.

366
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,870
[SANJI]
You're not fooling anyone.

367
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,740
The truth is, you want us to
help you get there, don't you?

368
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,240
You got me!
Is it that obvious?

369
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,980
[LUFFY]
Look, I get it. It's fine.

370
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
We'll take you. Don't worry.

371
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,810
[STANSEN] Seriously? Thank you!

372
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,380
[NAMI] Now wait a minute, Luffy!

373
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,580
What about the log pose?

374
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,380
If we change course now and
don't go to Fishman Island,

375
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,320
we'll be screwed!

376
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,750
[LUFFY] If we drop
them off real quick,

377
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,890
it shouldn't be
a problem, right?

378
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,920
C'mon! It'll be fine!
It'll all work out in the end!

379
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,590
[STANSEN] Haha!
Your crew is lucky

380
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,830
to have such an
understanding captain!

381
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,830
All right then!

382
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,930
I place our care in your hands.

383
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,350
[USOPP] I'd like
to propose a toast

384
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,390
in honor of your good
fortune and journey back!

385
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,020
Here's to a safe return!

386
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,030
[LUFFY] I'll drink to that!

387
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,030
[ALL] Cheers!

388
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,900
[JIRO] So how did it go?

389
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,700
[CHOPPER] Well, I did
everything that I could.

390
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,870
Now the only thing
we can do is wait.

391
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,610
Thank you so much, Doctor!

392
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,710
[CHOPPER] It's not over yet.

393
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,880
That wound
still needs to heal.

394
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,390
[snoring]

395
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:46,970
[snoring]

396
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,980
[LAGO] So what now?

397
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,940
[GUYLE] Isn't it obvious?
We have to do it!

398
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,580
[TROFF] But I don't
really want to anymore.

399
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,520
They helped us and fed us.
They're such nice people.

400
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,620
I feel the same.

401
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,590
And those ladies
are so beautiful.

402
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,490
[GUYLE] Listen to yourselves!
What are you saying?

403
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,360
We can't let this
chance pass us by!

404
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,360
[SUTTON] He's right.

405
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,430
If we had a ship this
powerful at our command,

406
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,760
--then maybe we could--
--[STANSEN] That's enough!

407
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,930
[STANSEN] We'll deliver
the ship to them, as planned.

408
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,100
Everything will proceed
according to the mission

409
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,970
we were given.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,540
To hell with the mission!

411
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
We won't do it!

412
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,770
We'll take this ship
and launch a counterattack!

413
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,610
If we don't, Vigaro's
death will be in vain!

414
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,950
[FRANKY] Hey, guys!

415
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm not really the type to go
looking for an apology, but...

416
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,780
...you should
probably gimme one

417
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,980
after making up that lame story.

418
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,220
[LAGO] No way!

419
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,890
You should be asleep by now!

420
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,390
[ROBIN] If I'd slept after
drinking poison like that,

421
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,060
I'd have nightmares.

422
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,190
You bastards have
got a lot of nerve

423
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,460
ruining my first-class dinner
with that rotten stuff.

424
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,970
I assume you're ready
to face the consequences.

425
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,810
[ZORO] Those three should
be able to handle it.

426
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,910
[yawning]

427
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,020
[PEOPLE]
Happy birthday!

428
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,660
[laughing]

429
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,160
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

430
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,760
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

431
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,930
[CAMPACINO] What is it?

432
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,830
[SALCHOW] The trophies are
being cornered as we speak.

433
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,840
[CAMPACINO] Oh?

434
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,600
[SALCHOW] Those saps are
taking control of their ship

435
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,940
at this very moment.

436
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,570
[CAMPACINO] Oh, them?

437
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,010
I wouldn't expect them
to be so useful.

438
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,510
[SALCHOW]
Yeah, well, it looks like

439
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,550
they kept their word,
didn't they?

440
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,720
And it seems the bounty is
through the roof this time, too!

441
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,950
[CAMPACINO] Really?

442
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,920
[SALCHOW] Yep!

443
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,050
It's Monkey D. Luffy
and the Straw Hat crew!

444
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,130
Their collective bounty
is over 660 million Berries!

445
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,200
[CAMPACINO] Well, well, well!

446
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,100
What fortunate timing.

447
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,570
[SALCHOW] I agree! Absolutely!

448
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,570
[CAMPACINO] Very well, then.

449
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
I'll leave the rest to you.

450
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,040
[SALCHOW] Yes!

451
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,800
In the name of the family,
it shall be done!

452
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,870
Man, you would not believe--

453
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,910
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Click.

454
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,750
[CAMPACINO] It seems this is
going to be one hell of a party.

455
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,660
[ROBIN] These unexpected
visitors are quite a nuisance.

456
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,600
[FRANKY] It doesn't matter
how many of them there are,

457
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,070
I'll--! Whoa, wait.

458
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,800
Are we surrounded
by Marines again?

459
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,240
[ROBIN] You seem
almost happy about it.

460
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,740
[FRANKY chuckling]

461
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,070
[FRANKY] This'll be
my chance to show you

462
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,570
just how super this ship is!

463
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,180
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

464
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,780
Sunny in a Pinch!

465
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,150
Roar, Secret Superspeed Mecha!

466
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
