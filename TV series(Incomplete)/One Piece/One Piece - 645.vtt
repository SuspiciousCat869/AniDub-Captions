00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:37.882
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.788
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.998
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.504
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.777
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.614
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.003
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:08.744
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:13.019
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.359
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.296
the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.668
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.706
Their current objective
is to destroy

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.045
a man-made Devil Fruit Factory
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:28.684
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:31.256
with the Flame Flame Fruit
as a prize.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.761
He's registered in
the match for Block C--

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:38.236
a furious battle royale
that is now underway.

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.140
[HAJRUDIN]
You made a big mistake.

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:43.781
[LUFFY]
Crap! Moocy, run! Go!

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:48.122
[GYATS]
This is a tragedy, folks!

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:54.803
[HAJRUDIN]
Hm?

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:56.740
[LUFFY growling]

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:08.530

Lucy just felled the Giant!

[CROWD cheering]

00:05:09.586 --> 00:05:12.424
That was incredible, Lucy!

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.734
My heart's beating
outta my chest!

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.839
With fighters like this,
can you blame me?

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:23.681
A single contender is turning
this competition on its head!

00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:28.222
Just when you think it's over,
Lucy has done it again!

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.911
Thanks for partnering up
with me. Sorry you got hurt.

00:05:38.944 --> 00:05:42.050
Don't worry, Moocy. Let's go.

00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:48.296
[GYATS]
Just who is this mysterious Lucy

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:51.102
and where did he come from?

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:54.441
[CROWD chattering, laughing]

00:05:57.715 --> 00:06:00.588
Hmph. Yeah. A real mystery.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:07.067
Unbelievable. I never imagined
he was this strong.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.171
Go Lucy!

00:06:17.788 --> 00:06:20.260
[IDEO] What do you think
you're doing, Giant?

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:23.199
You're still inside the ring.

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:27.240
Wanna take a nap?
Then do it someplace else.

00:06:35.758 --> 00:06:38.062
Losers don't belong here.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.736

[CROWD gasping, screaming]

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:53.528
Hajrudin goes flying! Is some
kind of explosion to blame?

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:57.635
What just happened? Tell me!

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:22.652
[GYATS] Hang on!
That wasn't an explosion!

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:25.257
Let's not forget even
without Hajrudin,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.329
Block C's loaded with power!

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:31.903
That powder keg punch
was generated by a man

00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:35.310
with some distinctly
shaped shoulders!

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:37.581
Ideo!

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.251
[GYATS]
The one who rocked the giant

00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:42.959
right outta the ring was none
other than the two-time champion

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:46.031
of the New World Central
Fighting Tournament!

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.506

Heh. Nobody can
outpunch Ideo!

00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:55.751
Damn straight!

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:58.824
[COMPETITOR A] Cut the "two-time
champion" crap!

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:02.030
That doesn't mean a thing
here in the colosseum!

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:03.099
You got that right.

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:04.936
[COMPETITOR A yells]

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:08.845

is your strength!

Hm?

00:08:15.524 --> 00:08:18.930
In that regard,
I have you soundly beat.

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:24.943
I got this competition
in the bag!

00:08:24.976 --> 00:08:27.447
Just hand me the prize already!

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.316
Heh.

00:08:48.355 --> 00:08:51.028

elsewhere in Dressrosa...

00:08:51.061 --> 00:08:53.165
[ZORO panting]

00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.779
You're totally unbelievable!

00:08:59.812 --> 00:09:02.852
You have absolutely
no sense of direction!

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:05.858
It was just a slight mistake!
I know where I'm going now!

00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:07.160
"Slight mistake"?

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:10.801
There's nothing slight
about it in the least!

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:12.404
You've gone the opposite
direction from where

00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:15.744
I told to go you over 27 times!

00:09:15.778 --> 00:09:17.948
Plus, you ran down a staircase
you just climbed up

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:21.790
on 31 different occasions!

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:24.061
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:26.265
We're moving further away
from the Flower Field

00:09:26.298 --> 00:09:27.969
and time is tick-tick-
ticking away!

00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:29.037

Pull yourself together!

00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:31.876
Do you ever shut up?!

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.849
You can't blame me just cause
you suck at giving directions!

[WICKA grunts]

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.726
I can't take it anymore.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.428
This is all your fault!

Jump in the air and fall
backwards? Sure did.

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.983
You care to explain
what the hell that was for?

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:55.089
Is he having some sort
of nervous breakdown?

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:57.093
[MAN B]
And who is he yelling at?

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:00.400
[WOMAN B] Let's keep walking.
What a creep.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.304
I have to tell my people
where the members of

the Don Quixote family are
as soon as possible

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:09.084

[ZORO grunts]
You're gonna break my rib cage!

00:10:15.697 --> 00:10:18.904
The only one who needs to
pull it together is you!

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:21.977
You think I don't have friends
I'm worried about also?

[WICKA grumbles]

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:24.448
If all you wanna
do is complain,

00:10:24.482 --> 00:10:26.753
go find some stray cat
to be your chauffeur!

Wait a sec. This place
feels awfully familiar.

It's just fine, thank you!

Sorry I got mad!
I need your help, please!

Is this the way?

Strength is the only way.
See what I'm saying?

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:08.884
I'll get there by winning
the competition.

By eating the Flame Flame Fruit!

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:14.361

00:16:54.193 --> 00:16:55.797
to challenge me!

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.568
[CHIN JAO yells]

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:05.717
[CROWD gasping]

00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.476
That was the Conqueror's Haki!

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.678
No surprise there.

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:22.885
He was a legendary pirate
worth 500 million.

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:25.156
[CHIN JAO] There's only one man
that I want to fight!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.127
Don't get in my way!

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.397
[JEAN sputtering]

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:32.971
[JEAN]
I gotta thank you, Chin Jao!

00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:35.209
You're giving me
plenty to work with!

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:35.911
[CHIN JAO]
Hm...?

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:37.714
[GYATS]
What's this?

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:40.988
Looks like not everyone's
susceptible to Chin Jao's Haki!

00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:43.593
And now he's collecting
spare weapons!

00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:46.633
This is truly the dark horse
of the competition,

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.135
Jean the Bandit!

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:51.308
A bounty hunter who's reputation
has earned him the wrath

00:17:51.342 --> 00:17:55.016
of every major pirate
across the New World!

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.220
Not so fast!

00:17:57.253 --> 00:17:58.524
[JEAN]
Eh?

00:17:58.557 --> 00:18:01.596
You and I have a score
we need to settle!

00:18:01.629 --> 00:18:02.932
Think I'd forget you?

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:07.173
The man responsible for getting
my partner locked away?

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:09.578
[JEAN] The weapons I retrieve
are my bullets.

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:11.917
And I am the sniper!

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.622
[COMPETITOR G groaning]

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:18.028
[JEAN] If that partner of
yours was so important,

00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:20.967
why didn't you prove it by
breaking him out of prison?

00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.675
Like that idiot who did
a couple of years back.

00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:27.180
[KELLY yelling]

00:18:27.213 --> 00:18:29.117
[AREMO screams]

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.622
What the...?
The guy's already out cold!

00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:33.994
Why's Kelly still
whaling on him?

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:36.799
[KELLY yelling]

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.468
Take a breather, big bro!

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:42.043
The guy ain't even conscious
anymore! That's plenty!

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:43.245
[KELLY grunts]

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:47.854
You know, in hindsight,
shoulda held you.

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:52.396
[panting]

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.034
Did you hear what he said?

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:55.938
That bastard called me "shorty"!

00:18:55.971 --> 00:19:00.012
Hey, Bobby! Do I look
short to you? Huh?

00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:01.649
Not one bit, no!

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.589
I mean, if anything you're
a giant of a man!

00:19:04.622 --> 00:19:07.327
[KELLY] You hear what he said,
dickhead?

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.534
That's enough!
He's learned his lesson!

00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:14.642
Uh... I held back
the wrong guy again.

00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:18.315
Try to say that again,
and I'll jab both your eyes out!

00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:22.758
And Bobby, don't you even
think of slowing me down!

00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:25.597
Just pace yourself--
it's a long fight.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.937
[GYATS] That's the ultra-violent
style of the Funk Brothers!

00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:31.174
There's not a soul in
the criminal underworld

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:34.247
that doesn't know the
names of these siblings!

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.884
And based off what I'm reading,

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:37.889
they're powerful enough
to take down pirates

00:19:37.922 --> 00:19:39.758
worth over 100 million!

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:40.827
[KELLY]
If someone calls me short...

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:43.399
[BOO] Buncha squawking
coming from over there.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.103
They look like nothin'
but a couple of

00:19:45.136 --> 00:19:48.309
two-bit street fighters to me.
I guess we'll find out.

00:19:48.342 --> 00:19:50.179
How about you show me
what you're made of?

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:51.181
[KELLY]
Huh?

00:19:51.214 --> 00:19:53.352
I'm talkin' to you, shrimp!

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:55.156
[KELLY grunts]

00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:57.426
What did you just call me?!

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.166
[groaning]

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:02.771
[BOBBY]
Brother, no!

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:03.941
[BOO]
Jeez, pal!

00:20:03.974 --> 00:20:06.211
So weak!

00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:09.919
Or perhaps the Happosui
Army's just overpowered!

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:12.123
But still, how disappointing!

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:15.864
Hey! Do you hear me?
You let everyone down!

00:20:15.898 --> 00:20:17.667
[ATTENDANTS]
You can't pick sides!

00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:21.107
[BOO grunts]
Like a walk in the park!

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:23.680
So, ya ready, little brother?
'Cause you're next!

00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:28.623
Wait a sec! I don't even
know how to fight!

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:31.929
I've never done this, for real.
Not in my entire life!

00:20:31.962 --> 00:20:33.600
You will now!

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:34.935
[BOBBY grunts]

00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:40.079
[GYATS]
He turned his back and cowered!

00:20:40.112 --> 00:20:42.852
These brothers are pathetic!

00:20:42.885 --> 00:20:46.659
[BOO] That broke my ax in two!
It doesn't make sense!

00:20:46.692 --> 00:20:49.698
That blade was infused
with Armament Haki!

00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:53.005
His body is ridiculously strong!

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:55.142
You okay, bro?

00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:59.651
That... That bastard had
the nerve to call me a shrimp?

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:04.294
Hurry up, Bobby.
Put it on... for me!

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:07.935
[BOBBY] I... Okay.

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:16.519
[IDEO, LUFFY yelling]

00:21:16.552 --> 00:21:18.757
Uhh...! Uh-oh, lost my helmet!

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.592
[IDEO]
Where you goin'?

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.428
[WOMAN C screams]

00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.463
There's no way!

00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:24.902
I can't believe what
I'm seeing right now!

00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:25.971
Boo!

00:21:26.004 --> 00:21:31.148
[KELLY grunting]

00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:33.185
[GYATS] Boo from the
Kano Kingdom is taking

00:21:33.218 --> 00:21:37.293
a hell of a beating!
He is down for the count!

00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:38.996
But who's that punching him?

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.067
The cowardly younger
brother, Bobby?

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.609
Or could it be the weakling
older brother, Kelly!

00:21:44.642 --> 00:21:46.612
Why it appears to be Kelly!

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:51.254
Surprising, given his sudden
change in appearance!

00:21:51.287 --> 00:21:55.229
Who you callin' a shrimp?
Let that be a lesson!

00:21:55.262 --> 00:21:58.903
Next time wise guy,
I'll rip your throat out!

00:22:01.743 --> 00:22:03.680
[GYATS]
Wow! During this mayhem,

00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:06.351
it appears Lucy's helmet
got knocked off!

00:22:06.384 --> 00:22:08.021
[LUFFY]
Hey! Give that back to me!

00:22:08.055 --> 00:22:11.863
[JEAN] You know, I heard a very
peculiar tale, Lucy.

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.935
A rumor about a pirate
with a 400 million bounty

00:22:14.968 --> 00:22:17.039
by the name of Straw Hat Luffy.

00:22:17.073 --> 00:22:19.377
Who secretly entered
this competition.

00:22:19.411 --> 00:22:21.481
[laughing]

00:22:23.218 --> 00:22:26.726
[CHIN JAO]
I'm coming for you, Straw Hat!

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.863
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:22:30.133 --> 00:22:31.367
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:34.542
[GYATS] Don Chin Jao is cutting
his way across the arena.

00:22:34.575 --> 00:22:36.478
But who's he got his sights on?

00:22:36.513 --> 00:22:39.183
I sure hope you're
watching this, Garp.

00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:42.357
Cause I'm about to
kill your grandson!

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.094
[LUFFY grunts, growls]

00:22:44.127 --> 00:22:46.933
And we are down to
the last 40 contenders

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:49.203
remaining in block
C's battle royale!

00:22:49.236 --> 00:22:50.540
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:50.573 --> 00:22:52.678
[GYATS]
The field has been weeded down

00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:55.583
to only the strongest fighters!

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:07.139
[GYATS] It's anyone's game!
But who will win?

00:23:14.488 --> 00:23:17.193
[NARRATOR] Luffy struggles in
battle after losing his helmet.

00:23:17.227 --> 00:23:19.497
And as things become
increasingly dire,

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:21.401
Chin Jao finally catches him.

00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:24.207
A famous pirate once
worth 500 million,

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.578
versus a rookie
worth 400 million.

00:23:26.612 --> 00:23:28.517
When these two
heavy-hitters clash,

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.087
the confrontation
will be unforgettable!

00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:32.891
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:35.797
"The Legendary Pirate!
Don Chin Jao!"

00:23:36.297 --> 00:23:38.836
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
