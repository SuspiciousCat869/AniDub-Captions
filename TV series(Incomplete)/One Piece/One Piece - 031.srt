175
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,563
Well... if you'll excuse me.

176
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,566
Why not stay awhile and
have a drink with me?.

177
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,535
I would, but the longer
a marine cruiser

178
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,036
stays docked at a pirate island,

179
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,105
the quicker we get
unwanted attention.

180
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,973
[ARLONG] I'll kill
anyone who reports you.

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,575
Everybody knows that.

182
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,077
[NEZUMI] Thank you,
but still, we must go.

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,446
[ARLONG]
Hey, the captain is leaving!

184
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,982
Escort him back to his ship.

185
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,417
[HATCHAN]
Yes sir.

186
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,054
The pot's back
that way... Hop in.

187
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,590
Thank you!
That's very kind of you.

188
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,591
[HATCHAN]
When I see your face,

189
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,060
it always makes me want
to laugh. It's funny.

190
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,261
You look like a rat.

191
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,597
[laughs]

192
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,933
Hey, Hatchan watch
your mouth now.

193
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,935
The Captain's our honored guest.

194
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,269
[HATCHAN]
Oh, right,

195
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,604
Sorry about that.

196
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,472
[NEZUMI]
Don't worry about it.

197
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,178
[HATCHAN]
Here we go, men.

198
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,282
[NEZUMI] These Fishmen are
disgusting. Such a vile group.

199
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,785
But they sure do pay well.

200
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,103
[CHABO]
Hey you. Get outta my way!

201
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,039
Arlong's going to die today!

202
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,943
He killed my daddy and so now
I'm gonna have to kill him!

203
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,881
So move, or I'll have
to kill you too.

204
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,616
Hey!

205
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,819
[CHABO grunts]

206
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,520
Now...

207
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,556
You should know that Arlong
doesn't have time to deal with

208
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,825
whimpering little
punks like you.

209
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,995
You're too young. Go home.

210
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,663
[CHABO whimpers]

211
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,697
Take that with you

212
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,067
and use it to keep yourself
out of trouble, kid.

213
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,969
Go to hell.

214
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,544
[ARLONG]
Nami! You've returned!

215
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,314
I haven't seen you around
here for quite awhile.

216
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,316
So, how did you do this time?

217
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,251
[NAMI]
Heh. Who are you talking to?

218
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,153
You know I can't believe
the world is full of

219
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,322
such blind idiots... Wanna see?

220
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,190
[laughs]

221
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,993
You, girl, are one
excellent liar.

222
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,695
That's true.

223
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,898
[ARLONG] Listen up everybody!
Nami's finally returned!

224
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,166
Time for a party!

225
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:12,204
[FISHMEN cheer]

226
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,409
[chuckles]

227
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,950
All right. We're here.
That's Arlong Park ahead.

228
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,388
[USOPP] Arlong Park, huh?
So this is the hideout of

229
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,124
Arlong the Fishman Pirate
from the Grand Line?!

230
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,325
[gulps]

231
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,961
[USOPP]
I hope Nami's really here.

232
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,765
Big Sis Nami's ship
was the Going Merry,

233
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,334
so before we do anything stupid,
we should quietly check

234
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,436
to see if it stopped
on this island first.

235
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,138
Yeah. Good idea.

236
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,845
Let's attack.

237
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,249
But I just said we shouldn't
do anything stupid!

238
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,084
What?! Attack?! You idiot!

239
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,153
We know nothing
about this place!

240
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,322
Yeah, these guys
are the Fishmen!

241
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,290
We need some kinda
plan to do that!

242
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,193
[ZORO] While the two of you are
busy blabbering and wimping out,

243
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,163
I'm placing my thoughts on the
battle we're about to face.

244
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,366
Luffy told me to bring her
back and I'll do just that.

245
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,934
[USOPP, JOHNNY whimper]

246
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,336
Let's go!

247
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,839
[USOPP, JOHNNY grunts]

248
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,778
[USOPP gasps]
There it is!

249
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,947
Ha! Found it! The Going Merry.
It's right over there.

250
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,816
Then she has to be on
the island somewhere.

251
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,484
We just have to find her.

252
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,020
What do think you're doing?!
Would you idiots untie me!

253
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,489
I am not the enemy!

254
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:14,193
[JOHNNY] We're east of Arlong
Park, here at Cocoyashi village.

255
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,795
But it's strange.

256
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,131
Why would she have stopped
so far from the village?

257
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,233
Untie me dammit!!

258
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,035
Zoro, you're hurt way too bad

259
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,872
to be of any help we go ashore.
Just sit tight and relax.

260
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,541
[USOPP chuckles]

261
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,211
It's okay. Rest up.
You can help next time.

262
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,848
[ZORO] One of these
days I'm gonna skewer him

263
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,049
like a piece of meat!

264
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,152
Fear not, gentlemen. I will
bring the girl back safely!

265
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,821
[laughs]

266
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,023
[JOHNNY] Looks, like,
skipping Arlong Park

267
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,991
has sure cheered you up.

268
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,226
[USOPP]
Prepare the anchor!

269
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,229
Bring us alongside
the Going Merry!

270
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,331
Aye!

271
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,234
[USOPP sighs] Yes!
Now that we're under way,

272
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,403
its time to give a
name to this voyage.

273
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,337
I think I shall call it,

274
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,173
"The Great Adventures
of Captain Usopp."

275
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,249
[gasps]

276
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,052
What is it? What'd you see?!

277
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,554
[BOTH]
It's Fishmen!

278
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,223
[USOPP]
Full speed ahead.

279
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,757
[JOHNNY]
Okeydoke.

280
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,528
Why didn't we just
dock right there?!

281
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,230
[USOPP, JOHNNY]
Shh!

282
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,364
Didn't you see that?

283
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,267
There were three Fishmen
over there. It's Arlong's crew.

284
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,603
We can't stop here right now.

285
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,371
Do not yell at me!

286
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,939
If there are fishmen here,

287
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,475
this entire area must be
under Arlong's control.

288
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,077
So what now?

289
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,413
[USOPP] Huh. We could just
say we couldn't find her.

290
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,416
Untie me now, morons! Come on!

291
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,887
[FISHMAN A] Huh. Never seen
that boat before.

292
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,989
Suspicious.

293
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,323
[USOPP, JOHNNY gasp]

294
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,291
Let's run.

295
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,292
Okay.

296
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,961
Untie me! Damn it!

297
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,464
[JOHNNY, USOPP gasp]

298
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,632
[USOPP]
Bye.

299
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,302
[ZORO] Hey you two get back
here or you're gonna die!

300
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,941
[grunts]

301
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,576
There's just this one guy?

302
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,612
Maybe he just drifted here from
real far out or something.

303
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,247
Yeah right.

304
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,349
[ZORO] Those guys are dead
and they don't even know it.

305
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,419
Or maybe somebody just wanted
him to die real slowly.

306
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,188
[FISHMAN A] I think we
should take him to Arlong.

307
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:23,989
[USOPP gasps]

308
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,291
Forgive me Zoro.

309
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,327
I will tell Luffy that you were
courageous to the bitter end.

310
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,364
Please forgive me Zoro!
I'll never forget you!

311
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,533
Okay, now let's find some land.

312
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,534
[JOHNNY]
Right.

313
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,009
[JOHNNY grunts] I think this
place is called Gosa village.

314
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,644
[USOPP grunts]

315
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,315
[JOHNNY, USOPP gasp]

316
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,961
[USOPP]
Uh. What happened here?

317
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,030
I heard Arlong came
through here

318
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,034
a few weeks back but I
never thought that...

319
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,004
[USOPP]
Everything's upside down!

320
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,074
I've heard people say that
Fishmen can be stronger than

321
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,377
normal human beings by
a very wide margin.

322
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,412
I guess this is how
strong you have to be

323
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,514
to survive the Grand Line.

324
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,587
[JOHNNY gasps]

325
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,057
Maybe, but even the
street's upside down.

326
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,227
The monster Momoo
caused this destruction.

327
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,695
[USOPP]
Monster?

328
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,566
Don't tell me this
place has monsters.

329
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,267
We caught him out
on the grand line

330
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,203
and brought him
back here with us.

331
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,271
[USOPP]
From the Grand Line, huh...?

332
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,273
Wait... We?

333
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,608
[yelps]

334
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,411
You! You were with
that guy from the boat!

335
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,546
[USOPP yelps]

336
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,081
[USOPP]
Later!

337
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,416
[FISHMAN A]
Come back here!

338
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,721
[JOHNNY sighs] That was close.
I wish you luck.

339
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,289
I'll just hold my
position here

340
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,192
and wait here for our back
up from Yosaku and Luffy.

341
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,695
[USOPP laughs]
You may be a Fishman,

342
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,064
but there is no way you can
catch me on dry land.

343
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,233
[USOPP laughs]
I'm a very fast runner!

344
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,069
I'm a beautiful gazelle.

345
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:21,607
[USOPP grunts]
What the‐‐?

346
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,375
Got you stupid Fishman!

347
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,111
And now I'll avenge my
father by killing you!

[NOJIKO]
Honestly.

353
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,619
How many times do I
have to tell you, Chabo,

354
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,287
you do not mess
with the Fishmen?

355
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,623
It was just one person who
decided to stand up to them

356
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,626
and they responded by
slaughtering everyone in Gosa.

357
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,163
[NOJIKO] Hm. You look and
smell just like a Fishman,

358
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,066
but I can see that
you're human. Mostly human.

359
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,801
Ah! Mostly?!

360
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,303
[FISHMAN A]
Where'd you go? Over here?

361
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,571
Crap.

362
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,806
A Fishman!

363
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,241
And this time it's for real.

364
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,279
All right. Stand back
and let me handle this one.

365
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,313
Watch as Captain Usopp...

366
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,249
...takes out this Fishman
with a single shot.

367
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:09,755
Take this. It's my
Special Attack: Lead Star.

[grunts]

369
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,297
I guess he wasn't listening
when I said the Fishmen

370
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,832
would kill us if we
messed with them.

371
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,433
Come on, tough guy...

00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,505

373
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,272
What's wrong?

374
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,274
[NOJIKO]
A long‐nosed creepy guy!

375
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,175
Which way'd he go?

376
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,343
That way.

377
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,378
[FISHMAN A]
Now I gotcha.

378
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,482
Come on. If you help me out,
we can carry him back.

379
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,128
Aw, yeah. Looks great.

380
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,295

[trumpet noises]

386
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,779
[HATCHAN]
Momooo! Lunchtime! Momoo!

387
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,715
Where is he? Kinda weird.

388
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,885
I've never seen Momoo
show up late to a meal.

389
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,720
I wonder what happened?

390
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,768
[YOSAKU]
Yummy. Thank you.

391
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,902
I don't care about you guys.

392
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,904
I'm just practicing for the
evening I get to make

393
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,140
dinner for Nami and myself.

394
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,945
[YOSAKU] I hope you can get
Nami to join the crew again.

395
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,479
She's the best.

396
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,116
Yeah, of course we will.
I mean she is our navigator.

397
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,753
[YOSAKU]
Ha, ha!

398
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,988
Hey, that's mine!

399
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,891
You just ate the other one.
I get to have one for myself.

00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,059
[LUFFY]
But I ordered the meat!

401

[YOSAKU]
I don't care! It's mine!

402
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,328
[LUFFY]
Over my dead body!

403
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,896
[YOSAKU]
You'll have to catch me first!

404
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,563
[LUFFY] Give it back!

405
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,130
[YOSAKU]
I'm taking a bite!

[LUFFY]
Don't you dare!

407
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,266
[YOSAKU]
It's got my spit on it.

408

[LUFFY]
I'll cut that part off.

You fools are going to
make me spill my wine!

know why I even bother

411
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,174
to give them good things.

00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,111
[FISHMAN B]
Open the gates!

413
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,847
We have prisoner on
board this vessel!

One more time.

415
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,696
What was your purpose in
coming here to this island?

416
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,198
Like I said before,

417
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,501
I'm looking for a girl
you half fish bastard.

418
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,639
[ARLONG scoffs] Wow! For someone
I'd consider a good meal,

419
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,040
you are either really stupid

420
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,276
or you've got a
lot of guts in there.

421
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,879
We fishmen are, simply, the
next rung up the evolutionary

422
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,115
ladder from you
pathetic humans.

423
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,950
We are incredibly resilient.

424
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,819
We can breathe both on
land and underwater,

425
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,055
an ability which
clearly establishes our.

426
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,791
physical superiority over you.

427
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,827
I don't know if this will make
any sense to that puny brain

428
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,230
rolling around in your
head, but fishmen...

429
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,998
...are the lords
of all creatures

430
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,834
and to fight against us
is to defy nature.

431
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,236
[NAMI] I'm really sick
of listening to your

432
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,572
big ideas, Arlong.

434
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,742
Why are you always
so serious Nami?

435
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,679
You know that I wasn't
talking about you.

436
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,247
You are a very special human,

437
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,717
our greatest navigator and a
valued member of this crew.

438
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,185
You always have been.

439
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,353
Say what you will,

440
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:05,023
but I'm a lot smarter than
any of you, that's for sure.

441
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,160
Why did he call you
his navigator, Nami?

442
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,163
You can't honestly expect me
to believe you work for him.

443
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,365
Hold on, is this guy
a friend of yours, Nami?

Don't be ridiculous.

This is just another fool who
thought I wasn't going to steal

446
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,573
all of his treasure right
out from under his nose.

447
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,377
To think he actually followed
me here without knowing that,

448
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,179
shows how stupid he is.

449
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,848
So this is the person
you really are.

450
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,617
All along I thought you
couldn't stand pirates.

451
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,787
You thought wrong.
It was all an act.

452
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,956
And you bought the whole show.
