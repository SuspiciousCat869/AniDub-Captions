1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:06,373
Those pirates sure know how to
bring the party, don't they?

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,142
I don't know if they
have common sense,

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,210
but they sure as heck have guts!

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,146
Just you wait and
watch, Chimney.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,616
In the end, whether they live
or die, that Straw Hat boy

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,152
and all of his little friends
are gonna shake things up

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,087
the whole world over.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,591
In hundreds of years, nobody's
pulled a stunt like this one!

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,593
Mark my words.

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,296
When this battle is over, every
man, woman, and child

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:33,033
is gonna know the
name of Straw Hat Luffy!

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,511
Robin!

13
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,380
Yeah! He made it!

14
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,817
Luffy!

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,354
I'm here to save you!

16
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,424
Chief Spandam, sir,
there's a man in a straw hat

17
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,626
standing on the
courthouse rooftop

18
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,461
who's shouting
things at Nico Robin!

19
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,529
I wasn't able to confirm
his identity up close,

20
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,164
but I assume it must be Luffy!

21
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,131
On the rooftop?

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,134
How could that happen
when I saw Blueno up

23
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,602
there just a second ago?

24
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,072
I thought he was
keeping watch! That idiot!

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,474
What the hell is he doing?

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:23,117
Guess I've been running
around a lot, huh?

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,586
Man, time for a snack!

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,088
Good thing I came prepared!

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,659
Meat time!

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,632
I knew putting these in my
pockets was a good idea!

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,068
I just wish I had more pockets!

32
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,509
So that's him, huh?

33
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,177
Straw Hat Luffy.

34
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,613
But what the hell
is going on here?

35
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,549
If Blueno was up there,
he should have--

36
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,787
It can't be.

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,022
No, he couldn't have--

38
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,592
Blueno's a member of CP-9!

39
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,126
A Six Powers master!

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,062
With Devil Fruit
powers, no less!

41
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,564
His power level is superhuman!

42
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,635
All right! Ready for round 2!

43
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,471
How could that scrawny
brat ever defeat him?

44
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,647
Ch-chief Spandam, sir,
how should we proceed?

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,616
Lucci! Where is he?

46
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,253
Somebody call him, now!

47
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,088
And the rest of CP9, too!

48
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,155
I've had enough.

49
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,424
I won't be satisfied until
they wipe out Straw Hat

50
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,460
and everyone in
his wretched crew!

51
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,695
Uh, yes sir! Understood.

52
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,497
And while you're at it,
tell Baskerville that

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,333
if he lets the Straw Hats
lower that bridge,

54
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,736
I'm going to send all
three of his heads rolling!

55
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,503
Yes sir!

56
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:54,741
Hey.

57
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,143
Get that chin up, Nico Robin.

58
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:02,116
You know, most people wouldn't
come here to save their friends.

59
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,219
Hell, most people couldn't
even make it here at all.

60
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,820
Don't get me wrong,

61
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,489
I know the only
reason you agreed

62
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,392
to the Government's terms was
so you could protect 'em,

63
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,693
but you saw what happened.

64
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,595
They don't give a damn
about keeping their word

65
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,664
to you or anyone else.

66
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,599
The deal is shot.

67
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,401
Even if you keep your
end of the bargain,

68
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,802
it's not gonna help anyone.

69
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,238
Only thing left is
to wait for your crew

70
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,773
to break you outta this dump.

71
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,108
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

72
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:34,615
And yet, here you are,
looking as miserable as ever.

73
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,417
I get the feeling you're
running from something

74
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,451
even your friends
don't know about.

75
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,658
I wouldn't worry about the
Straw Hats dying in this place,

76
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,194
but if you can't look 'em
in the eye, in the end,

77
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,796
they won't be able to save you.

78
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,465
Hey! Is anybody there?

79
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,207
Well, whether
you like it or not,

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,575
I'm gonna make you face him.

81
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,510
Huh?

82
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,106
Listen up, all of you!

83
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,442
We're putting Nico Robin out of
Straw Hat's reach immediately!

84
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,344
Come with me to
the Gates of Justice.

85
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,812
Bring the prisoners!

86
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,481
Bu--but Chief!

87
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,783
No buts, just do it!

88
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,718
Well-- uh.

89
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,788
There's one giant butt
that's a big problem!

90
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,355
Ah!

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,158
What the hell is that?

92
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,826
Oh, hey Spanda.

93
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,062
Like you said, I'm
pretty much screwed,

94
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,598
so I figured I might as
well blow myself up, y'know.

95
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,599
What?

96
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,533
That way, at least I get

97
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,236
to take your sorry
ass with me when I go.

98
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,805
You fool! Wait a
minute, will you?

99
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:45,806
When my butt goes off,

100
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,576
the explosion's gonna
be at least a mile wide.

101
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,580
Not much point in running,
but you might as well try.

102
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,814
I don't know what's
going on in your pants,

103
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,283
but please make it stop!

104
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:59,620
Three-- two--

105
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,722
Damn it, I can't die
at a time like this!

106
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,457
One!

107
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,560
Stop it!

108
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,429
Time to go, Robin!

109
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,001
Coup de Boo!

110
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:20,941
Good!

111
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,709
The chains are broken, too!

112
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,745
We're falling!

113
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,482
Super!

114
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,197
That was a close one.

115
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,299
Good thing that fence was
there to catch us, huh?

116
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,101
Hey.

117
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,203
You didn't get hurt, did you?

118
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,643
If I had another bottle of cola,

119
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:59,279
I could get us to the other
side with a Coup de Vent.

120
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,181
Hey, check it out.

121
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,783
Straw Hat's over there.

122
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,387
Now's your chance,
better give him your answer.

123
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,388
He tricked us!

124
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,255
Chief!

125
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:10,357
Franky and Nico
Robin broke the chains

126
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,359
and went out on the balcony!

127
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,128
Then what are you
waiting for, stupid?

128
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,362
Capture them already!

129
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:18,198
If you let them get away, I'll
send you all to the gallows!

130
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,033
What?

131
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,777
Hey, Robin!

132
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,211
You're still there!

133
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,179
Didn't you hear me yelling?

134
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,416
Luffy.

135
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,584
Don't let them get away!

136
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,052
Grab them before they run!

137
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,321
I don't have time
for you thugs right now!

138
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,289
Weapons Left!

139
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,394
Guess that mean's
Franky's there, too.

140
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,130
'Kay! I'll be right over!

141
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,667
It's a little far,
but I can make it!

142
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,119
Gum-Gum--

143
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,187
Stop it!

144
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,329
How many times do
I have to tell you?

145
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,430
I'm not coming back!

146
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,499
I'm not part of
your crew anymore!

147
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,201
Just go away!

148
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,103
I don't want to see
your face ever again!

149
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,170
Don't you understand?

150
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:32,773
Why did you come to
save me in the first place?

151
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,408
Why can't you just let me go?

152
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,212
I never asked for this!

153
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,281
You've gone too far!

154
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,116
For the last time.

155
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,384
I don't want you here!

156
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:59,232
Do you hear me?
I just want to die!

157
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:11,077
Now this is
entertainment! What a twist!

158
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,113
What the hell are
you trying to pull?

159
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,784
Your friends put their lives on
the line to come here, and you--

160
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:18,686
They decided to
do that on their own.

161
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,653
Are you kidding me?

162
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,788
Who cares if--

163
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,327
You're in the way.

164
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,497
What's wrong, Kaku?

165
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,066
Venting your anger?

166
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,668
'Cause your Devil Fruit
powers are so lame?

167
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,703
Oh, shut up already!

168
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,471
I like my powers just fine!

169
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,409
Oh?

170
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:45,112
All this ruckus
for one little pirate?

171
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,280
Yoyoi!

172
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,349
Alone though he may be,

173
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:52,385
his perseverance is
certainly admirable!

174
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,557
I'll be damned.

175
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,527
So he beat Blueno
after all! What a fool!

176
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,696
Being a barkeep for
five years probably

177
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,199
didn't do his fighting
skills any favors.

178
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,035
So it would appear,
but it's still a surprise.

179
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,605
Either way, he lost! Chapapa!

180
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,377
I'm glad you could
all make it, CP9!

181
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,345
And just in time, too!

182
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,181
It seems the Straw Hats
are having a little tiff!

183
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,650
It's quite amusing!

184
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,053
You really shouldn't miss it!

185
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,281
Gero gero gero gero gerooo!

186
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,782
Gero?

187
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,321
Good work out there,
Yokozuna! Keep it up!

188
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,755
Gero!

189
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,164
Guilty.

190
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,464
Guilty.

191
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,200
Yes!

192
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,702
It's the Guilty Jury!

193
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,669
Step aside.

194
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,438
It's time for that frog
to hear its verdict.

195
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,209
Gero?

196
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,148
Guilty!

197
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,116
Guilty!

198
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,167
Ugh! Just what we
need, more weirdos!

199
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,770
Guilty! Guilty!

200
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,240
Let's get 'em, Chopper--wait,
I mean, go get 'em, Chopper!

201
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,809
What? Me? Alone?

202
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,043
I gotta admit.

203
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,747
I never thought there'd be an
actual judge on this island.

204
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,650
I heard that the people

205
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:06,586
who get taken here are
already considered guilty,

206
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,590
so the Marines just lead the
poor saps through an empty court

207
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,225
without even stopping.

208
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,494
I'm afraid you're
mistaken, pirate.

209
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,196
On the contrary, this
courthouse carries the integrity

210
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,399
of the greatest
authority in the world.

211
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,368
Even scum like you are
given a trial by jury.

212
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,435
However.

213
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,739
The jury here consists
entirely of former pirates

214
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:29,376
who have been condemned to death
row in this very courtroom.

215
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:33,079
Therefore, their only desire is
to drag others down with them.

216
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,720
This place really is the gate
to the underworld, isn't it?

217
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,423
Thus, in all the trials
carried out on this island.

218
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,290
Not once.

219
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:47,328
Has any criminal
been found 'not guilty'!

220
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,528
Kiwi!

221
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,801
Oh no!

222
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,535
Guilty!

223
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,706
Guilty!

224
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:00,441
Damn, they're too strong!

225
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:02,643
We can't give up now!

226
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,679
If we don't bring down that
drawbridge, it's all over!

227
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,616
Remember, Straw Hat is the one
who's gonna rescue our Bro.

228
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,850
If we can't help him with this,

229
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:13,120
then we have no right to call
ourselves the Franky Family!

230
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,188
Gero!

231
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,059
Yokozuna!

232
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:24,131
You took all of those blows for
us and never budged an inch!

233
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:27,267
I'll avenge you!

234
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:31,338
Don't bother! We've
still got 6,000 marines!

235
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,038
Now!

236
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,708
Let's storm the courthouse, men!

237
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,244
Crush those pirates!

238
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,750
Gero.

239
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:53,527
What's going on?

240
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,362
Why are the giants here?

241
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:59,433
It's the frog!

242
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,301
What's the situation here?

243
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,737
Wait. I know you!

244
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,406
You're with the Straw Hats!

245
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,607
What are you doing
with those giants?

246
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,545
Can't believe he held off all
those marines on his own!

247
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,382
Yeah, he's one hell of a frog!

248
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,193
Where did they run off to?

249
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,395
They must've gotten lost again.

250
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,164
We don't have
time for this crap.

251
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,037
Oh yeah, as long as I go up,
everything should work out fine.

252
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,239
Tatsu maki!

253
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,343
Huh? What?

254
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,585
We better keep moving!

255
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,667
You pirates really are in a
league of your own, aren't you?

256
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,536
You're even strong enough
to order giants around!

257
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,272
It's almost scary, really.

258
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,341
Hm? Well-- uh--

259
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,709
Oh, by the way,
your other crewmates

260
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,578
are headed to
the roof right now.

261
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,412
The roof?

262
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,447
You should go meet them!

263
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,815
Leave that one to me.

264
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,151
I'll get you there in a flash.

265
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,452
Huh?

266
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:32,693
You wanna die?

267
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,294
That's right.

268
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,533
Wait a second, Chief.

269
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,168
Why are we
listening to this crap

270
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,704
when we could just go over
and pound that guy's face in?

271
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:45,773
Patience, patience!

272
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,840
Here we have a captain

273
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,143
who risked his life to
save one of his crewmates

274
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:53,080
only to have his precious hopes
dashed at the very last second.

275
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,115
How tragic!

276
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,051
And yet I can't
tear my eyes away!

277
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,519
It's too amusing!

278
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,521
Robin!

279
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:04,158
I don't know what to say.

280
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,826
Wow, could he be more pathetic?

281
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,395
I gotta see the
look on his face!

282
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,399
Sorry, but that
sounds dumb to me.

283
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,603
He's picking his nose?

284
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,174
Listen, that won't work.

285
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,776
We're already here,
and it was a lot of trouble.

286
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:35,756
So we're gonna go
ahead and save you.

287
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,591
Landed.

288
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,162
And if you still wanna die
after we're all back together.

289
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,799
Well, that's your choice.

290
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,804
Ow, ow ow.

291
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,173
Looks like you landed on
your head--are you okay?

292
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,575
Yeah, I'll be fine.

293
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,611
What the heck
happened back there?

294
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:00,780
I think I might have
an idea of who to blame.

295
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:10,524
There we go.

296
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,425
That was a lot easier

297
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,260
than dealing with
those stupid stairs.

298
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,295
There he is!

299
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,562
I knew it was you!

300
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,398
You're lucky we got
out of the way in time!

301
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,833
If that thing had hit us
head-on, we'd be dead right now!

302
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,435
Oh, you're here, too?

303
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,473
Dash!

304
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,575
Boar Stew Shoot!

305
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,513
I'm the first one
here, no doubt.

306
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,448
I've left Robin
waiting long enough.

307
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,517
Time for her prince
to--Moss head?

308
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:38,752
What are you doing here?

309
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,354
You're gonna ruin everything!

310
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,089
Finally made it, huh?

311
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,457
You get lost or something?

312
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,493
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa, don't you dare!

313
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,562
Don't even go there!

314
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,335
It's Sniper King!

315
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,109
What? He's flying!

316
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,611
Awesome!

317
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,213
Where's he been all this time?

318
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,055
How is he supposed to land?

319
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,493
Look at that!

320
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,761
The gang's all here.

321
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:21,729
Yoyoi!

322
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:25,366
Quite the show, indeed!

323
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,834
Sniper King!

324
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,370
Although they may be
our sworn adversaries.

325
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:33,640
To have come this far
is truly quite impressive!

326
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,412
This isn't funny anymore!

327
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,146
Just go away!

328
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,336
C'mon Robin, work with me here!

329
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,804
You can say what you want.

330
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,507
If you wanna die or
whatever, that's fine,

331
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,377
but when you say it,
you say it as part of our crew.

332
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,781
Yeah Robin, he's right!

333
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,216
Come back, Robin!

334
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,440
Hey Sniper King, can you stand?

335
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:42,442
Hm? Uh yeah, of course.

336
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,612
A fall like that won't stop me!

337
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,322
Really, I'll be fine.

338
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,181
From now on,
leave everything to us!

339
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,463
Don't get cocky with me,
you stupid pirates!

340
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,299
I have the power to
put you in your place

341
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,367
and I'm not afraid to use it!

342
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,368
You wouldn't.

343
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,704
I'll wipe them out just
like your hometown Ohara

344
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,739
was wiped out 20 years ago!

345
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,375
The Buster Call
is mine to command!

346
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,143
Stop it!

347
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,311
Anything but that!

348
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,745
On the next One Piece:

349
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:34,548
"Robin's Past! The Girl
Who Was Called

350
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
