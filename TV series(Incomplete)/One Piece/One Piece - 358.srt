Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

We've left the established course

5

Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540

Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

them dyes your heart

attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:53,848
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,418
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43

44
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:03,324

lost in negativity?!

Now listen up. There's no one.

Not anyone in this entire world.

You say you're
gonna kick my ass?

[LUFFY] Yep. That's right.

67
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:32,747
[MORIA] Well, even if
you do manage to beat me,

68
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:35,917
or even kill me,
it won't do any good.

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,785
The zombies will
lose their master,

70
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,421
but the shadows
won't return to you.

71

[LUFFY] Oh yeah?

00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:42,457
That's right.

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,294
My power controls the
shadows. That's absolute.

74
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,830
So fair warning, if you
want the shadows back,

75
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,865
then there's only one solution.

76
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:53,001
You have to get the
commander of the shadows.

77
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:55,837
In other words me,
to issue them an order.

78

Because they aren't going
anywhere unless I say so.

[LUFFY] And that's all it's
gonna take to get them back?

00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,680
You got it.
Pretty simple, huh?

82
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:07,015
You might even be
able to force me

83
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,784
to return them if you
kick my ass hard enough.

84
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,953
Well, I say that,
but with your power.

85
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:15,289
I doubt you can even
lay a finger on me.

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,314
You have to go
through him first.

90
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:43,818
Consider him my double.
I call him the "Doppelman."

91
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,092
In the past, I was just
like you-overconfident

92
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,495
in my abilities and full
of unrealistic ambition.

93
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,498
But then I realized that the key
to victory is having underlings.

94
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,833
Real strong ones.

95
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:02,570
You suck doppel-guy.
Come on. Move it!

96
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,708
I'll never do anything
on my own again.

97
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,709
Without lifting a finger,

98
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,446
my minions will make me
the King of the Pirates!

99
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,049
The King of the Pirates
is gonna be me!

100
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,619
I seem to recall your
zombie making the same claim.

101
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:24,892
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

102
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,895
When there's such
an extreme difference

103
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,697
between the body and the shadow,

104
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,133
then the personality of
the shadow's original owner

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,602
lingers a bit more than usual.

106
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,873
But that sort of thing can't
last forever, you know.

107
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,108
It's only a matter of time

108
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,944
before all of your
memories will fade and Oars

00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:46,948
becomes an obedient zombie
slave, just like the others.

No matter how strong
its will may be,

111
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,419
every zombie will bow
to me sooner or later.

112
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,621
I don't mind being
patient for a while.

00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,560

out for the salt!

with her minions around!

be my chance to shine!

care of the other pirates,

that even work?

00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,142
[snickers]

178
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,777
What?

179
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,280
[panicked screams]

180
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,517
[ZOMBIE CANINE] Hot! Hot hot!

181
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,387
Guys! No! Wait!

182
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,821
Here goes!

183
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,555
[KUMACY] You can't.

184
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,490
Get outta the way!

185
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,226
I'll set you on fire too, bear!

186
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,627
Come back!

187
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,666
What's with this guy?

188
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,867
This isn't fun anymore!

189
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,569
Can't he just leave me alone
and go bother someone else?

190
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,538
I'm tired of fighting!

191
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,208
[USOPP] I'd give up,
if I were you!

192
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,412
For the record, I'm really
good at running, too!

193
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,149
Get rid of that guy
already, Kumacy!

194
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,650
No! Don't!

195
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,818
[KUMACY] Stop running!

196
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,821
[USOPP] No! You stop running!
And you, too, Ghost Girl!

197
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,323
[PERONA] Not until you stop!

198
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,327
[KUMACY] I won't let you lay
a finger on Mistress Perona!

199
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,496
[USOPP]
Whooooa!

200
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,402
For such a fluffy
stuffed animal,

201
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,671
that thing really packs
a punch, doesn't it?

202
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,772
He can't unzip his own zipper,

203
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,875
but he sure is good at
running and wrecking stuff.

204
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,880
[KUMACY] Now I'm angry.

205
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,949
[USOPP] What?
That was a compliment!

206
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,519
Gimme a break! Wait! This way!

207
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,423
[USOPP] Go away!

208
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,879
[USOPP] Leave me alone!
I mean, come back here!

209
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,747
I mean, don't hurt me!

210
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,216
I mean, you better
run, you bastard!

211
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,485
Wait, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

212
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,953
[KUMACY] This is stupid!

213
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,729
[USOPP] No! Help!

214
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,900
Aaaah! Stop it! Leave me alone!

215
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,471
[USOPP] I can't help it!
He's chasing me!

216
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:10,956
[deafening footsteps]

217
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:18,430
[deafening footsteps]

218
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,402
Yay. I made it to the ocean!

219
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,386
I'm getting pumped!

220
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,693
I'ma be King of the Pirates!
You hear me? The king!

221
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,497
[OARS] Yeah!

222
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,716
[SANJI] And skip,
and skip, and skip.

223
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,853
Why, is that a Nami I see?
Get your hands off her!

224
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,532
Sorry to keep you waiting.

225
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,768
Your knight has arrived.

226
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,756
[OARS] One. Two.
First we loosen up the arms.

227
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:30,796
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

228
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,600
Stretch the legs, there we go.

229
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,736
Ahhh... Nice and loose.

230
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,479
Ah, I wonder why I'm so stiff?

231
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,517
Like my muscles haven't
moves in years, or something.

232
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,520
Hope I 'member how to swim.

233
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,923
Gonna be kinda bad
if I sink like a rock.

234
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,925
Here goes nothing!

235
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,674
This sucks! I'm drowning!

236
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,856
[HILDON] You just
came back to life

237
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,724
and you already
have a death wish!

238
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,560
What would've happened if
you drank that salt water?!

239
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,562
With your size a
little might not hurt,

240
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,998
but in case you missed
the memo-you're a zombie

241
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,934
and that means salt separates
your body and your shadow.

242
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,505
Ah water sure is wet.

243
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,207
[HILDON] Do you have any brains
in that thick skull of yours?

244
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,045
Do you have any? Shut up!

245
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,255
[sighs]

246
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,102
It's okay. Everything is--

247
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,809
Wait this is... a-a goddess!

248
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:54,348
No, wait a sec. I got confused.

249
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:57,117
This is definitely Nami.
Just calm down.

250
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,586
Man, that's crazy.
What a surprise.

251
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,622
It's just,
she was so beautiful,

252
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:05,526
for a sec there I thought I
rescued some goddess by mistake.

253
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:07,461
Phew!

254
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,331
Huh? A Princess?

255
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,370
No. It's that goddess.

256
00:18:16,437 --> 00:18:19,506
Uh, wait, I mean,
it's Nami, just like before.

257
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,441
That's good.

258
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,209
I mean, princesses
are nice and all...

259
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:24,445
[ABSALOM] What the hell
is he mumbling about?

260
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,313
This moron is out of his mind.

261
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,314
Hey!

262
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:29,716
You're a member of that
pirate crew, aren't you?

263
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,288
It's an angel!

264
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,794
[ABSALOM] Oh, no,
it's just my bride.

265
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:44,531
My mistake. That scared me.

266
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:47,501
I know, right? I feel
you on that one, man!

267
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:49,703
I mean, it's like, the only
things that look good in white

268
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:50,871
are Nami and rice.

269
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,539
[ABSALOM] Amen, brother.

270
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:55,509
[ABSALOM] You might
say, one look at her

271
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,845
will stop you white
in your tracks. Get it?

272
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,314
So, uh what now?

273
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,548
Enough chit-chat!

274
00:19:01,582 --> 00:19:03,817
Don't you try to
get friendly with me!

275
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,895
[SANJI] Hey! You almost
hit Nami with that!

276
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:16,563
Attacking me is one thing,

277
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:19,433
but show some damn courtesy
when there's a lady around!

278
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,269
Oh, by the way your shadow.

279
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,937
It's gone, isn't it?

280
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:25,172
Yes, that's right.

281
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,673
One of the new
zombies we created

282
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,842
was strangely
attached to my bride.

283
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,445
It seems the will of
his shadow hadn't faded,

284
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:34,715
so he wasn't
obedient to us just yet.

285
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,518
You won't lay a
hand on this lady!

286
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:39,453
[ABSALOM] That must've
been your zombie.

287
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,420
How pathetic.

288
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:41,955
They didn't even bother
putting your shadow

289
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,590
in a Zombie General.

290
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:44,958
And since that's the case,

291
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:47,895
I'm assuming your fighting
skills are pretty weak.

292
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:49,763
Both of you are
overdressed weaklings

293
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:51,698
that run your mouths too much!

294
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,967
I'm one of the Mysterious Three!

295
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:56,770
All of the Zombie Generals
are under my command!

296
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:59,439
Do you really think you
stand a chance against me?

297
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:00,741
Who is that?

298
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,279
Oh, it's Nami again.

299
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,548
This is really
messing me up. Jeez.

300
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,882
Pay attention
to me, damn it!

301
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,816
[SANJI] But you know what, Nami?

302
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,418
You're even better
than all the goddesses

303
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,554
and princesses and
angels in the world.

304
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,556
Get away from my bride!

305
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,959
Listen. I'm already pissed
that you ruined my special day.

306
00:20:18,992 --> 00:20:22,396
Just shut up and let me kick
your ass so I can kiss her!

307
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,897
Actually, you know what?

308
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:24,898
I'll be generous.

309
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,301
If you drag your sorry,
shadowless carcass out of

310
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:30,737
here right now and never
come back, I'll let you go.

311
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:37,010
The thing is,..
I'm really busy right now.

312
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,247
Your stupid captain's stupid
zombie went on a rampage

313
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,915
and smashed up
some of my best men.

314
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,450
But before I deal with that,

315
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:46,853
I'm kissing my damn bride,
and that's final!

316
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:48,622
You follow me?

317
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,857
I'm running very
low on patience.

318
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,762
I can't waste my time fighting
with some weakling like--

319
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,532
[SANJI] And you say
I talk too much, you creeper!

320
00:20:58,765 --> 00:20:59,600
Master Absalom!

321
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,969
No way! He weighs
more than 600 pounds

322
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,504
and he got knocked
back just like that?

323
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,277
So this is the big,
bad invisible man Usopp

324
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,446
was talking about. Hmph!

325
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,550
[ABSALOM thinking]
What was with that kick?

326
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:19,486
Hogback made my body
into the perfect animal!

327
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,888
No human should be
able to do that to me!

328
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,461
Hands of the Dead!

329
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,699
[ABSALOM thinking] How did he
know what I was gonna do?

330
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,801
Damn it, who is this guy?

331
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:39,973
[SANJI] Basses Cote... Longe!

332
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,174
You're the guy
that showed up on the Sunny

333
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,011
and dragged your filthy tongue
all over Robin, aren't you?

334
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:46,413
Something is grabbing me.

335
00:21:47,381 --> 00:21:48,715
And I heard you
were peeping on Nami

336
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:51,351
while she was naked
in the bath, too!

337
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:54,054
[ABSALOM] Hush, my darling!

338
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:57,024
Tendron! Flanchet! Quasi!

339
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:00,494
[thinking] This guy is just a
nobody! How is he so strong?

340
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:03,363
Cueue! Cuisseau! Jarret!

341
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,332
And why the hell is
Nami unconscious, huh?

342
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,035
You better not have
done anything weird to her!

343
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:13,373
[SANJI] You call
this crap a wedding?

344
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,941
You say that to my face again

345
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,444
and I'll pound you into
a croquette, you hear me?

346
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:19,513
I think I'd better
pull back for a second.

347
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:21,515
Invisi-skating.

348
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:25,619
Time for Usopp's Salt Balls.

349
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,590
[SANJI] There you are!

350
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:33,560
[ABSALOM] Augh!
What is this, salt?

351
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:37,531
[SANJI] Veau Shot!

352
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,539
[thinking] This bastard
doesn't even have a bounty!

353
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,641
What's going on here?

354
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,645
[SANJI] You say you're
running low on patience?

355
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,381
Well, I'm way
beyond that, buddy.

356
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:58,051
I'm so pissed off,
I'm about to explode!

357
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,754
He did!

358
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:05,092
[SANJI] And this is isn't
just about Nami, either. Oh no.

359
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,960
There's an issue.

360
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:10,063
A little something,
between the two of us.

361
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:12,766
That goes back a long way.

362
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,907
[ABSALOM] There's
an issue between us?

363
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:21,908
You sure about that?

364
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,076
[SANJI] Oh, I'm damn sure!

365
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:25,579
You bastard. You bastard!

366
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,581
[ABSALOM] But we just
met today, didn't we?

367
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,583
You must be mistaking
me for someone else.

368
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,984
[SANJI] There's no mistake.

369
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:33,520
You're the man who
stole my dream from me!

370
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,021
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

371
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:38,759
"A Clear-Clear History?
Sanji's Stolen Dream."

372
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,161
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
