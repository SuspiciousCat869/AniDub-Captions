1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,533
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,302
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:44,539
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:47,375
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:48,443
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,245
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:51,813
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,716
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,749 --> 00:02:57,652
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,354
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,788
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,822 --> 00:03:04,058
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,629
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:10,798
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:14,202
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,740
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,377 --> 00:03:24,345
[NARRATOR] In an effort
to save his brother Ace,

54
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,247
who had been
captured by the Navy,

55
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:29,751
Luffy journeys to the great
prison known as Impel Down.

56
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,753
Meanwhile, the other Straw Hats,

57
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:34,556
scattered around the globe
by Bartholomew Kuma,

58
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,758
face struggles of their own.

59
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,426
[LUFFY]
The Friends' Whereabouts!

60
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,529
An Island of Giant Birds
and a Pink Paradise!

61
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:51,472
[HANCOCK] How many times
must I repeat myself?

62
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,209
[yells]

63
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,546
[MARINES] Huh?

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,348
[whimpers]

65
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:02,417
[HANCOCK] Are my instructions
too complicated to penetrate

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,552
that thick head of yours?

67
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:07,722
I require at least
100 kilos of food per meal.

68
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:11,292
Anything less than that
is completely insufficient.

69
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,898
[HANCOCK] Do you want
to be turned to stone again?

70
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,634
No! Please! We're very sorry!

71
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,436
[MARINE 419B]
We'll be more careful next time!

72
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,438
Bring her another meal
to her specifications

73
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,373
to replace this one!

74
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,246
Here you are, Luffy!
Open wide for me okay?

75
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:38,219
[LUFFY] Simply delectable.

76
00:04:38,252 --> 00:04:40,655
And when you're the one
feeding it to me, why,

77
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:43,157
it makes it all the sweeter.

78
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,892
Oh? Go on.

79
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,595
[giggles]

80
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,764
Clearly that's
exactly what he would say!

81
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,332
[giggles]

82
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,437
[LUFFY]
What are you doing over there?

83
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,705
Who're you talking to?

84
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,274
[gasps, giggles]

85
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:01,676
[LUFFY] Aren't you
gonna eat something?

86
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,845
This Sea King Ham
is unbelievable!

87
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:06,748
[HANCOCK] No, no, it's fine.
Please, help yourself!

88
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:09,183
I'm more than satisfied
just as I am!

89
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,485
[giggles]

90
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,353
[MARINE 419C]
Dammit! I can't see anything!

91
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:13,354
Huh?

92
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,323
[MARINE 419D]
I know! The curtain's closed!

93
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,624
[MARINE 419C] Hold on a minute!

94
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:18,626
There's an open space
right over here.

95
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,295
[MARINE 419D] Ooh!

96
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,731
[BOTH] Uh... Aaah...!

97
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,667
Love-Love Beam!

98
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:29,771
[thud]

99
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:34,308
[LUFFY]
Who was it? Something wrong?

100
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:35,910
[HANCOCK] It was just
two bad-mannered rats,

101
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:37,779
so I taught them a lesson.

102
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,814
It's nothing for
you to worry about!

103
00:05:39,847 --> 00:05:41,382
[LUFFY] Okay.

104
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:44,619
Whoa! Look at that!

105
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:45,987
It's a warning!

106
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,322
If anyone ever tries
to peek into her room,

107
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:49,857
[MARINE 419F]
this is what will happen!

108
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:53,995
[MARINE 419F] She's so scary!

109
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:59,701
[giggling]

110
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,877
[NARRATOR] A few days earlier...

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,648
on an island somewhere
in the South Blue...

112
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,356
[CHOPPER] Luffy... Guys...?

113
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:31,299
Why isn't anybody else here?

114
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:33,301
[CHOPPER] Did they kill them?

115
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:37,472
That's ridiculous--
don't even think it!

116
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:42,410
It's not true.
It can't be! Guys!

117
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,282
[LUFFY] Hey, Chopper!

118
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,650
Huh?

119
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:52,987
[chuckles]

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,756
Luffy!

121
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,929
[gasps]

122
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,332
You're here!

123
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:09,270
[wailing]

124
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:15,610
[birds cawing]

125
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,046
[CHOPPER] When I woke up
and I was all alone, I wasn't...

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,882
scared at all! Really!

127
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:22,683
[chuckles]

128
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:28,089
Luffy, Usopp, come on!
Knock it off.

129
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:32,059
[CHOPPER] Ouch!
I said "stop," you big dummy!

130
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:35,463
You guys are gonna
regret this, you hear me?

131
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,039
[screams]

132
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,009
[CHOPPER] Hey. Where the heck
did these birds come from?!

133
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,944
They're huge!

134
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,914
Ah! Don't even think
about trying to eat me!

135
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:57,885
No! My body's too stiff
to get up and run!

136
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,588
I gotta move!

137
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:04,959
[CHOPPER]
Ow! Stop it! Leave me alone!

138
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,728
I'm getting dizzy!

139
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:09,897
[gasping quickly]

140
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:12,466
[yells]

141
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,703
[BIRDIE BIRD 419A] Mmm!

142
00:08:15,736 --> 00:08:17,672
[CHOPPER] No! Let me go!

143
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,941
Bastard!

144
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:25,446
Uh. Uh. Uh...?

145
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,014
Uhhh...

146
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,586
[CHOPPER] This island is weird!
This is a dream, right?

147
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:35,456
Please let it be a dream!
I wanna wake up!

148
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:36,123
[BIRDIE BIRD 419A grunts]

149
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:40,828
[hollers]

150
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,598
[CHOPPER]
Stop, I'm gonna hurl!

151
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,868
No! You birds are mean!

152
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,804
I'm a reindeer, not a toy!

153
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,372

[BOTH cawing]

159
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:23,704
[CHOPPER panting]

160
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:26,983
It's over now. I think.

161
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,590
[frogs ribbit]
[crickets chirp]

162
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:38,494
[CHOPPER] There aren't
any people here? Just birds?

163
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:48,871
Hey! Luffy! Everybody!

164
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,909
[sighs]

165
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,446
[CHOPPER] I'm the
only one on this island.

166
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,348
What am I gonna do?

167
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:02,785
I'm so thirsty. And hungry, too.

168
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:06,756
If only Luffy
and the others were here.

169
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,858
Even on a deserted island...

170
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,894
[CHOPPER] they'd still
throw an awesome party!

171
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,035
[laughing]

172
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:22,038
[CHOPPER] A party! A party...

173
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,042
[CHOPPER] Who am I kidding?

174
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:30,479
I'm lost, and they
could be dead, for all I know.

175
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:33,316
I can't take it!

176
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,717
[CHOPPER sobs]

177
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,420
Where is everybody?

178
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,691
Guys. Luffy...

179
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,359
Oh, yeah!

180
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,094
This!

181
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,063
[CHOPPER] We promised that
no matter what happened,

182
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:50,066
we'd meet up wherever
this Vivre Card leads us!

183
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,868
Luffy and the others
will be waiting!

184
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,504
I just know it!
Nothing can stop them!

185
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,506
They won't ever give up!

186
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,675
[CHOPPER]
And that goes for me too!

187
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,745
This is no time to
sit around and do nothing!

188
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,014
That's why I gotta
eat and get stronger!

189
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,650
This fruit is
pretty bitter, though. Ugh.

190
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:09,685
But I need nutrients! Bluh!

191
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,955
This one is super sour! Puhhh!

192
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,624
[CHOPPER] Gotcha! I'll need
meat to survive, too.

193
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,794
This guy... doesn't look
too yummy, though, I guess.

194
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,130
[CHOPPER] But what can you
expect on an island like this?

195
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,032
Gotta make do.

196
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,002
Whoa! You come
back here, dinner!

197
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,037
[laughs]

198
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,972
[CHOPPER]
Can't get away from me!

199
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,041
[CHOPPER] Huh? Uh--

200
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,609
[thonk]

201
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:40,649

[groans]

203
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:45,621
What the--? I wonder
who the heck hit me?

204
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,056
Ow! Ugh...

205
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,358
[CHOPPER]
And why is it so hot?

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,929
[gasps]

207
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,800
Uh. Uh...

[BIRDIE TRIBESMEN chant]

209
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,473
[CHOPPER screams]

210
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,842
I was supposed to
catch dinner, not be it!

211
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,478
It rare to get
raccoon on island.

212
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,080
Raccoon Hot Pot!

213
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:13,482
Raccoon nice,
but me rather have chicken

214
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,017
and make Chicken Hot Pot.

215
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,420
That good idea, but no chicken.

216
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,488
Raccoon will have to do for now.

217
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:23,459
Stop it! Shut up!
I'm a reindeer!

218
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,998

[CHOPPER gasps]

220
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,436
Ah. Guess we have
Reindeer Hot Pot then.

221
00:12:33,469 --> 00:12:36,806
Hey. Wait. Did reindeer
just say something?

222
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,908
Me not know
reindeers could speak.

223
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,176
[CHOPPER]
Good, you're finally listening!

224
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,011
Now let me down!

00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,479
--[BIRDIE BIRDS cawing]
--[BIRDIE TRIBESMEN] Huh?

226
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,681
Bad! We got crisis on hands!

227
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,716
We try to sneak up
into bird's nest,

228
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,084
but bird caught us!

229
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,553
[BIRDIE BIRDS] Mmm!

230
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:51,654
[BIRDIE TRIBESMAN 419B]
And now bunch of birds

231
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,888
are coming right for us!

232
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,956
[BIRDIE TRIBESMAN 419C]
Maybe we can shoo away?

233
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,591
[BIRDIE TRIBESMAN GOATEE]
Me say we run for it.

234
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,059
[SHANBA] We go now!

235
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,461
[CHOPPER] Come on, guys!
Don't leave your

236
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,696

behind for the birds!

240
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,105
Those birds are
really strong, huh?

241
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,675
[gasps] Oh, crap!

[panting]

245
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,562
[CHOPPER] The birds
rolled me around like a toy.

246
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,699
And those humans
tried to eat me in a hot pot!

247
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,902
What the hell's wrong
with this crazy island?

248
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,737
[BIRDIE BIRDS cawing]

249
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,507
[NARRATOR] This island
is known as Birdie Kingdom.

250
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,276
A place where
birds reign supreme.

251
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,545
One legend suggests
that its lands

252
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,113
are filled with hidden treasure,

253
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:54,458
but all Chopper
has found is danger.

254
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,379
[NARRATOR]
Behold, Peachy Island!

255
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:19,383
A dreamy, beautiful
destination on the Grand Line.

[WOMEN giggling]

257
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,063
[SANJI] My dearest Nami.
My sweet Robin.

258
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,465
It's been a while.

259
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,500
How are the two of you doing?

260
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,569
As for me, I'm--

00:14:46,076 --> 00:15:00,090
[birds cawing]

262
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,559
Where the hell... am I?

263
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,099
[SANJI] Bastard. This is all
'cause of that damn Warlord!

Oh, my goodness! Excuse me!

266

Mister, are you all right--
can you hear me?

267
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:24,214

269
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,531
[SANJI]
I can feel a tender touch.

270
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,200
And I smell something sweet.

271
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,036
I'm in the lap
of a beautiful woman!

272
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,307
Is it... Nami? Maybe Robin?

273
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:53,210
No, I must be dreaming.

274
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,511
It doesn't matter.

275
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,214
All I know is
I wanna stay here forever.

Hey! Wait a minute! Come back!

279
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:12,262
[SANJI] What's this?
You forgot your handkerchief!

280
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,533
[SANJI]
I guess it wasn't a dream.

281
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:20,170

[angelic music plays]

283
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:36,086
Uh. I still don't
have a clue where I'm at.

284
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,597
Beautiful.
Maybe I ended up in heaven.

285
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,433
[SANJI] Her name is Elizabeth.

[heart beating]

287
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:59,443
If this place really is heaven,

288
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,279
then, is she an angel?

289
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,281
[SANJI]
Oh, my heart is pounding.

290
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,452
What is this feeling?
So warm. This...

291
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,321
must be... love!

292
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:14,725

00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:26,804
No, I can't think about
such things right now.

298
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,340
[SANJI] Nami and Robin
are out there waiting for me.

299
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:32,376
But...

300
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,212
Well, the least I can do
is thank her for her kindness.

301
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:37,147
Through thick and thin
a gentlemen must always

302
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,882
be courteous to a lady!

[SANJI] Aaah! Nami and Robin!

304
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,387
Please forgive me
for being unfaithful!

[birds chirping]

308
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,300
It's the same design
as the handkerchief.

309
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,436
Then this must be
Elizabeth's place, I presume?

310
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,783
[SANJI]
Hello! Lady Elizabeth?

311
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:14,318
My name's Sanji.

312
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,920
You were looking
after me not too long ago?

313

return your handkerchief!

Uh. Aaah...

Hey, you didn't give me
a chance to say "thanks"!

317
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:36,273
No. Hold on. Shouldn't rush it.

318
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,542
[SANJI] She's obviously
a shy and innocent girl.

319
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,811
I need to be cool.
Have a little patience.

321
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,581
Pardon my manners.
Didn't mean to be rude!

322
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:46,750
Your hand was--
it was so lovely,

323
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:47,951
I couldn't help myself!

324
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:51,321
I just wanted to thank its
beautiful owner face-to-face!

325
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:53,724
But here I am
being too forward again!

326
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,592
[SANJI] Perhaps you would
allow me to apologize

327
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,761
and say thanks, as well,
by giving me the honor

328
00:18:57,794 --> 00:18:59,229
of cooking for you?

329
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,898
Whatever you'd like,
I'll make it!

330
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,500
Believe it or not,
I'm a world-class chef!

331
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,838
Or not.

332
00:19:07,871 --> 00:19:10,974
[ELIZABETH] So you...
you really like to cook?

333
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,877
Oh, yes! I love cooking!

334
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:17,414
[ELIZABETH] Then...
do you like clothes, too?

335
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,983
[SANJI]
Clothes? Like, fashion?

336
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,719
Yeah! U-Unlike some
stupid swordsman I know,

337
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:24,755
I actually care a lot
about the way I look!

338
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,524
[ELIZABETH] Really?
You're not just saying that?

339
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:28,458
[SANJI] Oh, no!

340
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,228
[ELIZABETH]
Then what about... dresses?

341
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,864
Dresses? Uh...

342
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:37,367
[SANJI] Oh, I get it! She keeps
asking me about stuff like that

343
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,369
because she wants
to know what I'm into!

344
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:42,239
She's making a love connection!

345
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,374
What do you think
of dresses like this?

346
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:45,642
Like them?

347
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:48,011
Like them? I love them!
They're beautiful!

348
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,347
Oh! You have no idea how much!

349
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,882
[ELIZABETH]
And what about flower prints?

350
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:55,886
Hell yes! Nothing in life
beats a gorgeous flower print!

351
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,821
[SANJI]
Ooh! They're so adorable!

352
00:19:57,854 --> 00:19:59,890
[ELIZABETH giggles]

353
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,692
All right, then.

354
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:06,763
Finally! Sweet Elizabeth is
opening up to me, after all!

355
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:15,505
[SANJI] Ahhh...

356
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,242
Oh, you have
exquisite taste, my dear!

357
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:24,615
[SANJI] Don't be shy.
You've already opened the door

358
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,985
to your home, now open
the door to your heart.

359
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,820
[ELIZABETH] Oh, Sanji!

360
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:30,687
[laughs]

361
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,723
No need to hold
anything back, my love,

362
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:34,825
just leap into my arms!

363
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,328
Oh, Elizabeth!

364
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,365
[ELIZABETH chuckles]
I think this dress...

365
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:43,834
...would look amazing on you!

366
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,402
Uh...

367
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:49,306
[groans]

368
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,776
[SANJI]
Ouch! Wasn't ready for that.

369
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:53,877
Heh-heh.

370
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,046
You're a lot stronger
than I thought you would be,

371
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,514
my dear Elizabeth--

372
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,316
[SANJI] Auuuggghhh..

373
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:02,919
[heart beating]

374
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:05,889
[SANJI gasps]

375
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:11,495
[SANJI gasps]

376
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:16,066
[SANJI groans]

377
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,535
[ELIZABETH (MAN) chuckles]

378
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,806
[SANJI] No. I was right.
I must be dreaming after all.

379
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,047
[SANJI]
But this is a nightmare!

380
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:34,017
[groans]

381
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:39,089
Aaah...

382
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:40,457
[ALL chuckle]

383
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,059
[SANJI screams]

384
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:45,128
We like the same things!
That makes you one of us!

385
00:21:45,162 --> 00:21:46,830
This is a safe place!

386
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:49,499
You don't have to pretend to be
something you're not anymore!

387
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:53,070
Yes! It's a free country
where you can be yourself!

388
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,740
[SANJI groans, yells]

389
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,674
Huh?!

390
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,443
[ELIZABETH (MAN)]
Now. Put on this dress.

391
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,946
And open up
the door to your heart!

392
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,648
[SANJI] No!

393
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:07,617
I'm... not gonna open anything!

394
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,553
--[QUEENS] No, don't go!
--[SANJI yells]

395
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,156
[NARRATOR] This island is known
as the second Maiden Island.

396
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,058
Everything here is pink.

397
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:17,627
All of the animals and
people who come to this land

398
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:19,129
share a common bond.

399
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,465
No matter what forms
their bodies take,

400
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,668
they still have girlish hearts.

401
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,137
[SANJI] How did I
think this was heaven?

402
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:32,642
[commotion]

403
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:34,878
Uaahhh...!
Leave me alone you weirdos!

404
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:38,749
I already told you
I'm not into that kinda crap!

405
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:42,052
[SANJI] My dearest Nami.
My sweet Robin.

406
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:43,520
It's been a while.

407
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:45,188
How are the two of you doing?

408
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:48,892
As for me, I'm--well... Uh...

409
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,161
How to put this...?

410
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:52,562
[yells]

411
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,464
[LIME DRESS QUEEN]
Don't run, sugar!

412
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,832
[RED DRESS QUEEN]
You can't fight it!

413
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:57,601
[BLONDE SCHOOLGIRL QUEEN]
You're one of us now!

414
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:00,036
Oh yeah, fat chance!

415
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,173
[QUEENS]
Welcome to Kamabakka Kingdom!

416
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:06,510
[SANJI] No. It's obvious.

417
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,978
I'm in hell.

418
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,586
[NARRATOR] Robin finds herself
in a far away land

419
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,221
with inhabitants that have
been forced to work

420
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:21,024
for 700 years, days and night.

421
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:24,027
She must either help them
or become enslaved herself!

422
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,129
Meanwhile, Usopp awakens
in a land full of

423
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:29,132
mysterious and
deadly plant life.

424
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,801
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece,

425
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,102

Bridging the Islands
and Vicious Vegetation!

427
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,174
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
