00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,489
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,226
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,827
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,797
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,365
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,101
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,803
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,772
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,576
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,211
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,779
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:02,749
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,552
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,889
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:12,092
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:16,830
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,404
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,673
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,707
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,511
Fighting alongside Whitebeard
and his associates,

21
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,913
he continues to push
toward the scaffold.

22
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,616
Although Whitebeard himself
is critically injured,

23
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,818
he entrusts Ace's
future to Luffy,

24
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:40,154
who is aided by
a team of pirates

25
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,222
forging a path for him.

26
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,560
Stop and listen to me!

27
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,494
What's wrong?

28
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,029
There's a new plan!

29
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,099
I'm either gonna live
or I'm gonna die.

30
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:56,536
So back up Straw Hat with
everything you've got!

31
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,705
[gasps]

32
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,976
They did it!

33
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,945
They cleared a path!

34
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,284
[MARINES gasping]

35
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,789
[ACE gasping]

36
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,824
We did it!

37
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,594
I'm here!

38
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,795
[LUFFY gasps]

39
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,303
Grandpa!

40
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,672
Get outta the way!

41
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,274
I'm not moving a damned inch!

42
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,078
I'm a vice admiral of the Navy!

43
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,816
I've been fighting pirates
since long before you were born

44
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,851
and I ain't stopping today!

45
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,453
Old man!

46
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,420
You're not my grandson here.

47
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,424
You are the pirate,
Straw Hat Luffy.

48
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,559
And I'll fight you to the death.

49
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,795
[LUFFY gasps]

50
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,466
This is the path that
you chose to take!

51
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,268
You and your brother alike.

Come on. Grandpa!

55
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,858
Let me by, please!

Hey! Coby!

[HELMEPPO] How could you
do this to my friend?

64
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,793
Coby looked up
to you, Straw Hat!

65
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,230
I'll make you pay for this!

66
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm too weak.

[gasps]

68
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,537
I have to get stronger.

Coby! You're alive!

70
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,909

Where's Luffy?

73
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,653
[HELMEPPO]
Who cares? He ran off!

74
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:26,654
Wait.

75
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,189
Garp is facing him
right at the scaffold!

76
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,091
Are those two
really gonna fight?

77
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,026
That's crazy!

I can't believe nobody
could stop that kid!

Damn it!

82
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,205
Don't worry about it.

83
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,740
It should be easy to
hit him from here.

84
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50,110
Take aim and fire at will!

We almost had him!

Who's side are you on anyway?

93
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,465
Not yours, fool!

94
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:15,269
What if you had hit Vice
Admiral Garp with a stray shot?

95
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,570
Uhh...

96
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,805
Yeah, but--

97
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,840
[HANCOCK]
I must protect him!

98
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:24,578
Because Vice Admiral Garp
is my beloved grandfather!

00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,313
Wait, that's not right!

100
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,849
Yeah, that's news to me, too.

101
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,986
Well, he will be if
I ever marry Luffy,

102
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,222

But cute.

The bridge is gonna
give out, Straw Boy!

lose it, whatever it takes!

Don't give up!

00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,682
...to ask a Marine
to step aside?!

112
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:06,053
You want to pass me?

113
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,356
Then treat me like any
other Marine you've faced

114

The only way you will
ever be a pirate

You're all tuckered out,

00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:50,785
but I see your stomach's
as lively as ever,

165
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,852
or as noisy at least.

166
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,829
[GARP] You probably
don't care for me much,

167
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,900
since I'm so loud and rough
with you all the time.

Can't blame you, really.

169

[GARP] But I'm not harsh
'cause I don't like you,

170
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,511
and I don't want you to be a
Navy man for my sake, either.

171
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,014
I just want you to have the
strength to do the right thing

172
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,982
and walk the right path.

173
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,286
[GARP]
That's my one and only wish.

174
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,065
[GARP] By the way, I swiped
some food from the Navy,

175
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,702
so you can eat all the
meat you want for once!

176
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,070
I figure they owe me a favor

177
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:46,407
and they'll probably think
pirates stole it anyway.

00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:58,985
Just move!

182
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,188
If you don't strike me dead,
then you'll lose Ace!

183
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,323
[LUFFY]
Shut up!

184
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,860
[GARP] You can't just cry
till you get your way!

185
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,528
I won't show you mercy!

186
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,798
[GARP]
You're a pirate, Luffy.

187
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,802
That makes you my enemy!

[ACE]
Damn it, this all wrong.

196
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,547
How the hell am I
supposed to feel?

197
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,016
Pops. Luffy. My friends.

198
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,619
They're here to save me, but
they're pushing through a sea

199
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,087
of their own blood to do it!

200
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,624
I'm sick.

201
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,093
These are tears of joy!

202
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:48,195
Even after all I've done,

203
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,464
I want to live!

[PIRATES gasping]

205
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,443
He took down Garp?

[LUFFY yells]

210
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:18,225
They're family, after all.

211
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,559
Damn it.

212
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,363
Ahh. Look at that!

213
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,700
I believe he just might make it.

214
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,035
Change your mind?

215
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,270
I thought you said
he couldn't do it?

216
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,706
I didn't say he could save Ace.

217
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,509
Now that he's at the top,
they'll die together.

218
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,543
That's all.

219

Finally, I'm here!

228
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,319
I told you I'd do it!

229
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,987
Luffy!

Hmph. You really are crazy.

Yeah, well... [giggles]

Hold on!

233
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,986
[HANCOCK]
Take this.

234
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,922
It's the key to your
brother's handcuffs.

235
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,823
I've got the key right here.

236
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,993
That's great, but how?

What the hell is that?

That's Sengoku's power.

242
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,759
I've never seen it!

243
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,261
Damn, he's huge.

244
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,735
Struggle all you like,

245
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:44,738
but you're trapped in
the palm of my hand!

This is insane!

[MARINES gasping]

249
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,856
That's not something you
should have, Straw Hat.

250
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,191
Let's fix that, shall we?

251
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,896
No! The key!

252
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:10,797
Now take aim!

Oh, crap! I lost it!

255

You've dug your own grave.

256
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,543
You're a criminal
as well, Straw Hat.

257
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,878
I've had enough.

258
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,247
I will execute the both of you

259
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:30,417

my own bare hands!

My goodness.

I think I must have passed
out for a moment there.

Straw Hat? What?

265
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,535
Wait. 3?

The whole scaffold's
coming down!

What happened up there?

279
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,085
Ace is still alive?!

I'll make a key!

Get those cuffs
off him and hurry!

You got it!

That's where Brother 3 went!

Holy crap!

00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,900
I thought he hightailed
it out of this dump,

288

but now he's right
in the middle of it!

is he wearing?

[MR. 3]
Not that one.

This isn't about
putting down a pirate,

00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:10,951
it's about maintaining the
integrity of our institution!

294

We must carry it out properly!

295
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,056

Excellent.

They said that Admiral
Borsalino stopped Straw Hat.

301
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,932
They're in the plaza right now.

Okay. That's that.

00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,847
Now what do we do?

308
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,516
Rescue Straw Hat
before it's too late!

[BON CLAY growls]

310
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,986
Because I'm his friend!

This is it.

Straw Boy.

Find Ace! Save him
and don't look back!

321
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:20,087
[MR. 3] He wouldn't run
away if he were here.

He honored his friendship with
Straw Hat to the bitter end.

Well, it was short notice

329
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:54,354
and we don't do this very often.

Fine! Let's move!

[MR. 3] Frankly, I couldn't
care less about your brother.

I'm here out of respect
for my late comrade!

but here's your key!

That is an ugly way to go!

[MARINE BB] Those handcuffs
are Sea Prism Stone.

be able to save him.

got Straw Hat in there, too.

It looks like a

Ever since you were little,

have you?

Then you run off and
do something crazy.

00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,032
Well, of course!

360
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,268
[PIRATES]
Ace!

361
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:49,770
It's... a true miracle!

362
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,071
Hey, I see them!

363
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:53,173
Look there, in the flames!

364
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,810
[BOTH gasping]

365
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:07,687
Let's go!

366
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,730
[NARRATOR]
Ace is free at last,

367
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,965
and the pair of brothers
are unstoppable.

368
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,968
Although the Whitebeard
Pirates are emboldened

369
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,069
by their teamwork,

370
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:24,204
their captain is not
convinced that their escape

371
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,706
will come so easily.

372
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:27,574
With his eyes on a new age,

373
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:30,243
Whitebeard makes a
difficult decision.

374
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:32,113
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

375
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:35,349
"Ace Rescued!
Whitebeard's Final Order!"

376
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:37,984
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
