1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,491
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,960
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,632
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:50,670
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,040
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,644
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,846
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,483
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,486
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,722
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,662
[MORIA]
Is something wrong?

48
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,864
Didn't you have
some plan to kick my ass

49
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,699
over and over again?

50
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,767
Yeah!

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,436
Don't get impatient on me;
I'll get around to it!

52
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,771
[MORIA]
Of course, that's fine.

53
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,372
I'm not trying to rush you.

54
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,874
I'm just worried
that he'll come back

55
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,509
before you get a chance to.

56
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,010
What's that mean?

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,545
Who the hell're
you talking about?

58
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,581
Kushishishi!

59
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,015
Why you of course!

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,388
I remember.

61
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,359
This isn't the time to
fool around out in the jungle.

62
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,361
I gotta go.

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,563
I gotta get back there fast.

64
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,099
[DOGGUIN] He's gotta be
the most useless partner ever.

65
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:53,933
Get back!

66
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,035
You realize
Robin's a lady, right?

67
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,570
[DOGGUIN]
A lady?

68
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,073
Who gives a crap?

69
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,644
Robin! No!

70
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,047
Wait. How could Sanji...?

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,749
That doesn't make any sense.

72
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,985
[USOPP]
Stop crying! It's too late!

73
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,088
[PERONA]
No!

74
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,889
Golden Pound!

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,902
You just stay put until sunrise.

76
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,139
Yahahaha!

77
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,749
Whoa!

78
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,683
Ya hear that?

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,619
It sounded like the
samurai said something.

80
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,821
I couldn't understand him.

81
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,791
A better question...

82
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,793
What in the
hell's goin' on here?

83
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,928
What's going on?

84
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,963
In short,

85
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,465
it looks like the
battle between them's over.

86
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,034
I've seen many
fights in my life,

87
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,437
but I assure you none of them
have been anything like this.

88
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,172
That samurai.

89
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,042
He scarcely used a
fraction of his strength

90
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,109
when he was fighting me!

91
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,118
[LUFFY]
"Slashes Dancing on the Rooftop!

92
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,455
Showdown: Zoro vs. Ryuma."

93
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,032
Nyohohoho!

94
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,533
So you think you can take my

95
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,570
black blade Shusui
away from me, do you?

96
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,271
Oh, I'm taking it.

97
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,674
I'm about to cut
you down and wrench it

98
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,176
from your cold. Dead. Body.

99
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,611
Oh, I see.

100
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,680
Feeling cocky today, are we?

101
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,681
Nyohohoho!

102
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,915
Whoa. Easy.

103
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,851
It's not a good
idea to provoke him.

104
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,021
[RYUMA] It looks to me that
you already have three swords.

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,555
True.

106
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,023
But... one's broken

107
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,793
and I've gotten
used to carrying three,

108
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,229
so it feels weird not to.

109
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,532
See, I use three-sword style.

110
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,534
[RYUMA]
Three-sword style, huh?

111
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,769
Never heard of it.

112
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,137
Is that some sort of circus act?

113
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,772
Nyohohoho!

114
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,908
No, it's nothing like that.

115
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:50,042
I assure you.

116
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,210
It's too bad.

117
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,578
I wish I could show you,

118
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,113
but I'll just
beat you with two swords.

119
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,548
[RYUMA]
Interesting.

120
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,084
I can sense you're very skilled.

121
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,886
A feeling that
I've long forgotten

122
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,054
is welling up
inside me once more.

123
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,259
It's as if I'm facing some
sort of beast, a savage animal.

124
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,162
This strange sensation
echoing deep in my bones

125
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,231
makes me feel as if
I'm dancing on air.

126
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,238
That shocked me!

127
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,785
[RYUMA]
Aubade Coup Droit!

128
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,757
[FRANKY]
Hang on. He's got a gun?

129
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,925
It's not a gun.

130
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,993
It's a thrust!
One of my techniques!

131
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,764
But when I use it, it doesn't
do nearly as much damage!

132
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,940
[FRANKY] He made a hole
right through the wall!

133
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,608
For a thrust to
fly like that.

134
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,677
It's just incredible.

135
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,979
[RYUMA]
Nyohohoho!

136
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,048
I suppose it's a tie, then.

137
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,650
Yep.

138
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,357
[RYUMA]
Nyohoho!

139
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,625
Very close.

140
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,360
You almost sliced me in two.

141
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,629
What the heck?
A counterattack?

142
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
But, when'd he
have time to do it?

143
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,734
About the same time, I think.

144
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,370
So this swordsman can
project his attacks as well.

145
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,973
This exchange of blows
was truly a tie.

146
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,674
That samurai zombie is using

147
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,410
the power of my shadow
to move around right now.

148
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,411
But before his death,

149
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,147
he must have been
an incredibly strong man.

150
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,418
Which means; the combination
of his strength and my technique

151
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,054
will make him quite
formidable indeed.

152
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:46,058
Are you trying to say that
those two are dead even?

153
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,927
[BROOK] I'm saying
these two swordsmen have

154
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,729
an incredible amount
of destructive power

155
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,863
at their command.

156
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,300
And as such. I don't think
this fight will last long.

157
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,976
Prelude Au Fer!

158
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,613
[ZORO thinking]
He's trying to break my swords!

159
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,684
Two-Sword Style: Flash!

160
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,195
Demon Bear!

161
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,679
[RYUMA]
Gavotte Bond Avant!

162
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,084
[ZORO] Two-Sword Style:
Draw Rashomon!

163
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,259
[ZORO thinking]
He took the hit?

164
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,869
[FRANKY]
They cut through the pillar!

165
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,379
Easy!
Whoa! This floor.

166
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,881
It's gonna break apart!
What do we do?

167
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,293
That's it.
We're outta here!

168
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,730
Hang on!
This place is falling to pieces!

169
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:39,372
Seventy-two Caliber Phoenix!

170
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,774
[RYUMA]
Polka Remise!

171
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,049
[FRANKY]
Weapons Left!

172
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,131
Whew! That was a close one!

173
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,957
[BROOK]
Watch out!

174
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,259
You're going to fall!

175
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,879
[ZORO]
Crap! I'm gonna slip!

176
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,499
Wow.
Even without a foothold!

177
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,513
[ZORO thinking] If this
goes on much longer,

178
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,114
my sword's gonna break.

179
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,883
This guy doesn't
just have the strength

180
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,219
of that legendary samurai;
he's got his wits, too.

181
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,247
[ZORO]
One-Sword Style:

182
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,049
Flying Dragon!

183
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,885
[RYUMA]
Three Verse Humming...

184
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,493
...Arrow Notch Slash!

185
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,561
[ZORO]
Blaze!

186
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,514
[RYUMA]
What...?

187
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,449
The wound caught fire?

188
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,955
[RYUMA]
My defeat.

189
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,566
[RYUMA] The legendary
owner of this blade

190
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:05,471
may have long since fallen,
but its story does not end here.

191
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,509
With you as its master, this
sword will surely be satisfied.

192
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,477
[FRANKY]
Ya hear that?

193
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,079
It sounded like
the samurai said something.

194
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:15,681
I couldn't understand him.

195
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,716
What in the
hell's goin' on here?

196
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,551
What's going on?
In short,

197
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,154
it looks like the battle
between them's over.

198
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,689
I've seen many fights
in my life,

199
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,524
but none quite like this.

200
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,359
That samurai.

201
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,195
He scarcely used a
fraction of his strength

202
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,032
when he was fighting me!

203
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,553
Huh? You mean the
fight is over now?

204
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,123
Such an impressive battle.

205
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,081
[RYUMA] This body
of a legendary samurai.

206
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,585
How shameful of me
to allow it to know defeat.

207
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,491
[ZORO] As long as you
feel shame, it's enough.

208
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,095
You're a true swordsman
in body and spirit, aren't you?

209
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,998
I wish I could have
met you in your era.

210
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,511
Is that...?

211
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,046
Yes! Yes, exactly!

212
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,614
My shadow, stolen by Moria

213
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,950
5 years ago has
been returned!

214
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,518
Yohohohohoho!

215
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,519
See? Look!

216
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,554
It does whatever
my body does!

217
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,956
Well, why wouldn't it?

218
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,557
That's what shadows do.

219
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,026
Stop raining on my parade!

220
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,193
You don't get it!

221
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,396
The missing part of myself
I've been trying to reclaim

222
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,397
has finally come home!

223
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,631
I'm whole again!

224
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:17,136
These feelings, this joy, they
really get my blood pumping.

225
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,737
Though,
I don't really have blood,

226
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,539
being just a skeleton and all.

227
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,475
Yohohohoho!

228
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,376
[BROOK]
It's back!

229
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,310
Finally!

230
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,981
After 5 long years,
my shadow is back!

231
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,988
I'll take this sword,
like I said,

232
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,590
but let's pretend like this
fight never happened.

233
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,161
Samurai from Wano.

234
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,204
[USOPP] I wonder if
Sanji found Nami yet.

235
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,073
Maybe he's even
rescued her by now.

236
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,442
And what are Luffy
and the others up to?

237
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,377
Either way, for now,
I just need to find them

238
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,446
and tell them that
I beat that crazy ghost girl

239
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,014
that none of them could stop.

240
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,516
I really shouldn't brag
about it, but I'm gonna!

241
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,584
Oh, man!

242
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,553
I can't wait to see
the look on all of their faces

243
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,021
when I tell them!

244
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,223
Ahahahaha!

245
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,358
[RANDOM WILD ZOMBIE 362A]
Mistress Perona!

246
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,529
[RANDOM WILD ZOMBIE 362B]
Do you think she's okay?

247
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,430
[RANDOM WILD ZOMBIE 362C]
Of course she is!

248
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,198
[RANDOM WILD ZOMBIE 362D]
Captain Kumacy

249
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,632
and Lieutenant
Hippo Gentleman

250
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,567
went to back her up!

251
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,702
I bet they're all
taking turns pummeling

252
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,604
that long-nose guy right now!

253
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,376
[USOPP]
Holy crap. Close one!

254
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,578
If those guys had caught me,

255
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,379
I wouldn't just lose the battle.

256
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,249
I'd also lose
all bragging rights.

257
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,054
Sanji! Everybody!

258
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,562
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362A]
What happened?

259
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,730
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362B]
Aren't all of these guys

260
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,498
supposed to be attending

261
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,800
Master Absalom's
wedding ceremony?

262
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,402
[HILDON] This is all that
special zombie's doing!

263
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,638
Before the ceremony
was complete,

264
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,640
they received orders from
Master Absalom

265
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,408
to assemble and stop Oars.

266
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,644
But they were annihilated as
soon as they engaged him.

267
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,246
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362A]
That's nonsense!

268
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,282
Even if he's a special zombie,
he's still one of us!

269
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,417
Why would he attack
his own comrades?

270
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,418
[HILDON]
Well, don't forget.

271
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,121
Oars was only recently
turned into a zombie.

272
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,756
It seems that
some of Straw Hat's will

273
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,525
is still strong inside him.

274
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,765
[OARS]
Cool!

275
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,134
This is one big ship!

276
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,303
It's settled!

277
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:35,607
I'll use this ship to become
King of the Pirates!

278
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:42,848
Now Gum-Gum--though it's
not really rubber--Gatling!

279
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:55,160
I'm tired of everybody getting
in the way of my fun time!

280
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,633
[HILDON] His lack of obedience
combined with his massive size

281
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,336
is quite the nuisance,
but he'll come around.

282
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,470
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362B]
Wait.

283
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,239
So you're saying he
wiped out the Zombie Generals

284
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,307
like it was nothing?

285
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,208
Instantly?

286
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,409
[HILDON]
Correct!

287
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,243
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362A] They must
have let their guard down!

288
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,712
There's no other
explanation for it!

289
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,855
[HILDON] If you guys don't
hurry up and make a run for it

290
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,224
as soon as possible,

291
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,226
Oars could wipe you out, too!

292
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,260
I know I'm leaving!

293
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,329
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362B]
Shut your mouth, Hildon!

294
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,764
How dare you underestimate
us, you little coward!

295
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,669
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362B]
Damn monster!

296
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,705
How dare he do that
to our comrades!

297
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,940
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362A]
We have our orders, troops.

298
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,176
Master Absalom
was very specific.

299
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,611
There's no need to hold back.

300
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,346
Now let's
uphold our reputation

301
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,680
as the
strongest division.

302
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,415
Show Oars what we can do!

303
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,684
He can't make
a mockery out of us!

304
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,368
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 362A]
Uh, alright. Get him!

305
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:16,208
Get outta my way! Bastards!

306
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,910
Gum-Gum...

307
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:36,828
Oh, yeah. I can't.
That was weird. I forgot.

308
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:41,233
Huh. Gotta get back fast.

309
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,811
Aw, what's wrong?

310
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:58,417
You tired, Straw Hat? All done?

311
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,418
Dammit.

312
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,787
Shut up! You're not
even doing the fighting!

313
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,455
So stop acting cocky!

314
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,289
You lazy jerk!

315
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,592
[MORIA]
I thought I already told you.

316
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,761
I'm going to become
the King of the Pirates

317
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,763
without lifting a single finger.

318
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,799
And with all these
powerful new minions,

319
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,701
that seems
quite possible, I'd say.

320
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,270
[LUFFY] I'm gonna kick
your ass and keep kicking it

321
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,505
until I get back
every last shadow you stole!

322
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,506
What, that again?

323
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,508
We've been at this
for quite a while already.

324
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,610
However long it takes,
I'll bring you down.

325
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,680
Both you and your stupid shadow!

326
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,786
Kushishi! Kushi!

327
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,898
Now Gum-Gum Rocket!

328
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,737
Listen.

329
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,972
Not that I care,
but you don't look so good.

330
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,476
I really wouldn't
keep this up if I were you.

331
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,678
And, if you don't
get out of here soon,

332
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,480
my backup might arrive.

333
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,417
Kushishishishi!

334
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,500
[HOGBACK]
Listen to me, Doctor Chopper.

335
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,001
The zombies here are happy!

336
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,605
It is possible to live a second
life in this world after all!

337
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,239
[CHOPPER]
You're wrong!

338
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,740
[HOGBACK]
Wrong? What?

339
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,542
How dare such
an amateur doctor--

340
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,743
[CHOPPER]
Shut up!

341
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,512
What you're doing isn't for
the advancement of mankind!

342
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,613
I'll never forgive you!

343
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,014
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

344
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,582
"Chopper is Furious!

345
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,951
Hogback's Evil
Medical Practices!"

346
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,354
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
