353
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,350
Now there's not proof,

354
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,252
so there's no way for
me to get yelled at.

355
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,024
[GHIN whimpers]

356
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,460
[GHIN] He treated me
with such respect,

357
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:19,131
and decency, and kindness.

358
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:24,536
That's why... I can't
bring myself to kill him.

359
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,538
Don't get caught again.

360
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,676
[GHIN]
I've always been loyal to you.

361
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,113
Up till now, I've believed
in what we've done.

362
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,317
I respect you and appreciate
all you have given me.

363
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,219
Trusting me as your
Chief Commander

364
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,155
was the honor of my life.

365
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,189
Until this moment,

366
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,992
I have obeyed every single
order you have given me

367
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,194
without ever questioning it.

368
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,364
I can't live with myself
if I kill this man...

369
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,534
...and I cannot break my oath.

370
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,537
Please, I beg you.

371
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,741
Let me disobey
just this one order!

372
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,376
Please!

373
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,085
[GHIN]
Don Krieg...

374
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,721
Listen...

375
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,156
Can't we just leave?

376
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,192
They can keep the
restaurant for themselves.

377
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,896
[Yelling] You little
son of a bitch!

378
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,534
You think you can defy my orders
and then tell me what to do?

379
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,738
[KRIEG]
It's pathetic.

380
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,007
Morality, sympathy...

381
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,277
Weaknesses I never
expected to see from you.

382
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,547
You are not my Chief
Commander anymore!

383
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,551
Pirates?

384
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,186
Step aside.

385
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,722
No! Not the gas!

We're all gonna die!

389
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,065
‐‐What?!
‐‐Poison gas!

390
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,733
[PIRATE S yelling]
Where's my mask?!

391
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,202
[PIRATE T]
Masks on!

392
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,636
[PIRATE U]
Move it, move it!

393
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,938
[PIRATE V]
He's using MH5!

394
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,272

[PIRATE B]
You bastard, you'll kill us all!

396
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,144
The only thing that
matters in a battle

397
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,979
is who ends up winning,

398
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,915
even if more have got to die.

399
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:21,053
Poison gas is just
a means to an end.

400
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,123
Victory is all that decides
what's right and what's wrong.

401
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:30,128
If you are dead, nobody's
gonna hear you complain anyway.

402
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,931
When you don't hesitate
to do unspeakable,

403
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:38,804
horrible things...
that, is true power.

Might as well throw
that gas mask away!

408
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,356
You're no longer worthy
to be a Krieg Pirate.

409
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,158
Die!

410
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:06,298

No! My captain
cannot be defeated!

423
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,235
Don Krieg is the
strongest man alive

424
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,470
and I respect his punishment.

425
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,739
Will you please snap out of it?

426
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,709
He's going to kill you!

427
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,210
I deserve it.

428
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,247
Obeying my emotions meant
betraying my captain.

429
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,251
If I were in his position, then
I would've done the same thing.

430
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,354
And now, death is the
only honor I have left.

But, it's much
too late for that.

435
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,502
Now, you will both die together.

436
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,338
It's the MH5
