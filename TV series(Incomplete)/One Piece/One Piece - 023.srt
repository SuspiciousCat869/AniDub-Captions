But if you say you don't need
any help, who am I to argue?

176
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,209
Us awesome fighters are
just gonna sit this one out.

177
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,210
Holler if you need us!

178
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,212
[USOPP groans]

179
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,089
[USOPP]
What'd you do that for Zoro?!

180
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,092
[ZORO]
Shut up already, you weirdo!

181
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:22,886
[KRIEG laughs]

182
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:25,597
Are those two guys your "crew"?

183
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,600
That's a pretty small
group you got there, kid.

184
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:29,768
Well, that's not all...

185
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,936
I got two more!

186
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:33,939
I'm not a part of your crew!

187
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:34,982
[KRIEG growls]

188
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:42,239
[KRIEG]
I'll deal with you later.

189
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,825
Right now, I'm going
to go feed my men.

190
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,997
Those of you who
don't wish to die,

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,626
can leave the restaurant
now and escape that fate.

192
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:57,838
The only things I'm after are
the logbook and this ship.

193
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:06,013
[KRIEG] However, if you wish
to stay and be slaughtered...

194
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:10,642
I have no problem burying every
last one of you at sea...

195
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:13,353
Know that.

196
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,040
It just got really quiet.

197
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,167
If Big Bro Zoro is in there...

198
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,169
Then, everything should be fine.

199
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:38,504
[YOSAKU]
Yeah, I know...

200
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,339
But what if it's not?

201
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,507
[JOHNNY]
Good point...

202
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,175
Big Sis Nami!

203
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,677
Should we go in there, too?
Whaddya think?

204
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,183
Big Sis?

205
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:53,685
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY yell]

206
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:54,394
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY groan]

207
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:55,687
[smooch]

208
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:58,190
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY gag]

209
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:04,530
Hey... Are you okay?

210
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,322
[NAMI]
Hm?

211
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,325
Yeah, I'm fine!
Is something wrong?

212
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,580
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY]
Huh?

213
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:17,668
[GHIN groaning]

214
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:22,172
[COOKS murmuring]

215
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,717
[GHIN groaning]
I'm... so sorry, Sanji...

216
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:28,345
I never thought it
would be this way.

217
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,848
[ZEFF] You have nothing
to apologize for, sailor.

218
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,725
[PATTY gasps]

219
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,561
[ZEFF]
Every cook at this restaurant

220
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,729
did what they thought was right.

221
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,232
That's all there is
to say about that.

222
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,358
But, Boss!

223
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:44,570
Why are you acting as if
you're taking Sanji's side?!

224
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,363
This mess is his fault!

225
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,364
[COOK V]
He's right!

226
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,409
Sanji is responsible for
this whole damn thing!

227
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,120
Yeah, Boss! That man's gonna
put your precious restaurant

228
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:54,204
out of business!

229
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,082
You fools don't know what
you're talking about!

230
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,418
None of you have any
idea what it's like

231
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,795
to be on the brink
of starvation...

232
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:05,257
To have no food or water
on the open ocean...

233
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,718
There is no way you could
possibly understand

234
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,596
what a terrifying
prospect that is!

235
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,640
It's the most difficult
situation a man can ever face!

236
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:14,766
What?

237
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:17,477
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, Chef Zeff.

238
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:20,564
[ZEFF] The difference
between all of you and Sanji,

239
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,232
is that Sanji knows.

240
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,321
[COOK A]
What's the boss trying to say?

241
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,615
[COOK C] Yeah, what's he
saying that Sanji knows?

242
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,576
[ZEFF grunts]

243
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,829
[ZEFF] If all you're gonna
do is stand around grumbling,

244
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,331
‐‐then leave this place
‐‐[COOKS gasp]

245
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:38,790
and never come back.

246
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,337
[PATTY] I, for one,
am gonna stay and fight!

247
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,423
I couldn't live with myself
if I accepted defeat!

248
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:47,758
[COOK W]
I'm staying, too!

249
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,344
After all, this is our
restaurant, isn't it?!

250
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,347
That's right, and this place
is all I've got, too!

251
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,309
[COOKS chattering]

252
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,436
[GHIN gasps]

253
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:01,855
What are you doing?!

254
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,525
You saw how powerful
Don is, right?!

255
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,277
[SANJI]
Hey, Ghin!

256
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,988
Listen up because I'm only
going to say this once.

257
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:14,159
Feeding someone who's hungry
is my sacred moral duty.

258
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,202
But...

259
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,835
Now that your crew is well fed,
I have no obligation to them.

260
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,003
With a clean conscience,

261
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:28,382
I can beat every last one
of them to a bloody pulp.

262
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,842
If anyone tries to
take the restaurant...

263
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:31,843
...they're dead.

264
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:35,222
I'll kill them without a
moment's hesitation.

265
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,682
Got that?

266
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,725
[GHIN gulps]

267
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,311
[PATTY] Hah! You're a
real head‐case, Sanji.

268
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,814
Letting him live, then
threatening to kill him?

269
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,565
Can it, cook.

270
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,859
[LUFFY]
See? This guy's awesome, huh?

271
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,237
Who cares how awesome he is?!

272
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,322
We gotta get out
of here right now!

273
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,740
Easy there, Luffy...

274
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:56,702
It is Don Krieg, but he's
in pretty sad shape.

275
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,829
[LUFFY]
Hm. Hey, Ghin!

276
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,206
You said you didn't know
anything about the Grand Line...

277
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:02,833
But I thought you'd been there.

278
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:04,584
That doesn't make any sense...

279
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,546
[GHIN gulps]

280
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:13,051
Nothing makes any sense now.

281
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,011
What happened to us
on the seventh day

282
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,265
of our journey through
that cursed sea...

283
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:20,600
I don't know if
it was a dream...

284
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,394
...or reality.

285
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:25,731
I saw things that I can't
bring myself to believe.

286
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:31,361
I know in my heart that
it's impossible...

287
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,281
...for that entire
50 ship fleet...

288
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:39,286
...to be completely
eradicated by a single man.

289
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,079
[COOKS gasp, whimper]

290
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:42,289
[USOPP screams]

291
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,416
[LUFFY gasps]

292
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,419
[COOKS]
What?!

293
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,485
[KRIEG grunting]

294
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,988
[GHIN]
It all happened so fast...

295
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,199
As soon as this man appeared,

296
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,869
he began to systematically sink
our ships one after another.

297
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:27,375
[GHIN] If that raging storm
hadn't come upon us when it did,

298
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,545
then that monster would have
destroyed our flagship as well.

299
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:43,391
[GHIN] I don't know if a
single other ship made it out.

300
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:47,729
It all seems like a terrible
nightmare burned into my memory!

301
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,023
I just want to forget!

302
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,900
His eyes...

303
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,238
They were like a hawk's,
sharp and murderous.

304
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,533
His gaze alone felt like
the cold hand of death!

305
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:00,408
[ZORO gasps]

306
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:01,409
[USOPP]
Huh?

307
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,704
[ZORO]
What did he just say?!

308
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,791
[GHIN growling]

309
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:10,252
[ZEFF]
Well then...

310
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:11,795
That can only be the one

311
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:15,257
‐‐known as Hawk‐Eye.
‐‐[COOK B] What?

312
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,467
[ZEFF] Your description
of his heartless gaze

313
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,971
isn't proof of his identity
in and of itself...

314
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,890
But the way he so easily
decimated your fleet

315
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,644
confirms without a
doubt, that it's him.

316
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,105
Hawk‐Eye Mihawk.

317
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,941
So you know him, Zoro?

318
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:34,734
Yeah, I do...

319
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,320
He's the man I've
been looking for.

320
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:40,323
Hawk‐Eye is the whole
reason I set out to sea.

321
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,576
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

322
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,744
[SANJI] Could that man
have had some kind of score

323
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,580
to settle with you guys?

324
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,123
[GHIN]
We didn't do anything to him!

325
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:51,334
[ZEFF] Perhaps you
disturbed him during a nap.

326
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,627
Stupid cook!

327
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:56,298
Why would he destroy an entire
fleet for something so trivial?!

328
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,134
[ZEFF chuckles]
There's no reason to shout...

329
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,469
It's just an example.

330
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,513
I thought you might like
a little friendly advice

331
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:07,017
on what kind of a place
the Grand Line is.

332
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,603
And what kind of place is that?

333
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,355
He probably means that
anything can happen there.

334
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,481
[USOPP sobs]

335
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:17,485
Hey, Luffy! Do we really,
really have to go there?

336
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:18,612
Luffy?

337
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:20,989
[ZORO, USOPP]
Hm?

338
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,993
[USOPP]
Hey... Luffy...?

339
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,496
[LUFFY laughs]
That's so awesome!

340
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:30,498
This is gonna be such a blast!

341
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:33,501
Don't you understand
the concept of "danger"?!

342
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,670
[ZORO]
Finally, my life's goal will

343
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,797
be achieved on the Grand Line.

344
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,174
What...?!

345
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,967
My rival...

346
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,012
He's out there somewhere,

Are you that stupid?

But lay off the name‐calling.

351
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,984
I devoted my entire life to

352
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:01,029
becoming the world's
greatest swordsman.

I made my choice,

354
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:05,533
so I'm the only one who
gets to call me stupid.

Hey! What about me?!

356
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:12,707
Me too, right?! I mean,
it only seems fair.

357
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:14,167
Shut up, stupid.

What morons.

Enough!

Do any of you maggots understand
the current situation?!

361
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:32,060
That enormous galleon moored
in front of our dear little

362
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,564
restaurant is none other
than Don Krieg's flagship!

363
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:40,527
So why don't we check back into
reality and deal with this?!

Yeah! We're saved!

[PIRATE C]
Nightmare's finally over!

368
00:19:00,046 --> 00:19:01,965
[PIRATE D] We sailed into
the pirate graveyard,

369
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,591
but we came back alive!

370
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,973
That's right... And I'm
glad you all made it

371
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:13,601

to go back to the Grand Line.

[PIRATES cheer]

379
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,510
[KRIEG] First, we need to take
over that floating restaurant.

380
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:51,598
Then, we can abandon the wreck
we're on before it falls apart.

381
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:53,308
Don't worry about the enemy;

382
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,602
they're just a bunch
of prissy cooks.

383
