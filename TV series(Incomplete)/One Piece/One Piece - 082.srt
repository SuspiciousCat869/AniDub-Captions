Uh...

175
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,906
[ZORO]
Oh, it's you, Usopp.

176
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,208
What are you guys doing all the
way out here in the snow?

177
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,245
[VIVI, USOPP] That's exactly
what we were gonna ask you!

178
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,382
[WAPOL laughs]
Take that you stupid bunnies!

179
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,018
You pathetic creatures got
exactly what you deserved

180
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,087
for going up
against a king.

181
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,424
Still, It annoys me that I had
to expend so much of my power

182
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,559
against a pack of
overgrown rabbits.

183
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,227
[CHESS]
There was no helping it, sir.

184
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,297
They are the fiercest
animals in Drum Kingdom.

185
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:48,541
And you're next... Straw Hat!

186
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,632
[LUFFY]
Doctor...

187
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,806
[LUFFY]
Doctor...

188
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,425
[LUFFY]
Doctor.

189

[LUFFY yells]

190
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:49,301
[LUFFY gasps, yells]
Sanji!

191
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,845
That was... a close one.

192
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,622
[USOPP]
Winter swimming?

193
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,824
[ZORO] Yeah... that was
the idea, anyway.

194
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,692
But after swimming in
the river for a while,

195
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,561
I had no idea where
I was anymore,

196
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,363
so I started walking
around and doing some

197
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:18,731
strength training workouts.

198
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,533
Dressed like that
in cold weather?

199
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,867
You're real stupid,
aren't you?

200
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,035
That isn't the point.

201
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,737
Now would you shut up and
give me your coat, Usopp?

202
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,505
Not a chance.

203
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,641
[VIVI] Maybe Nami's sick
from the mental exhaustion

204
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,709
of dealing with these two.

205
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,877
[ZORO]
Then how 'bout your shoes?

206
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,379
‐‐[USOPP] No.
‐‐[ZORO] Just one, then!

207
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,714
[USOPP] I said no!
You did this to yourself!

208
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,651
[VIVI gasps] Look at that, guys.
There's some people over there.

209
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:43,522
[USOPP] Huh? Uh, hey!
Look at those buildings.

210
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,391
They seem familiar, don't they?

211
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,692
[VIVI]
Huh?

212
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,566
[VIVI] You're right, Usopp.
This place is Big Horn.

213
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,567
We just came back.

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,603
It looks a lot different
buried in snow, though.

215
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,572
[PIRATE B]
Stay back... all of you!

216
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,576
Dalton's already dead, anyway!

217
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,445
It'd take more than a couple
flimsy arrows to kill him!

218
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,514
You're his men!
Or used to be, at least.

219
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,950
Don't you care at all about
what happens to Dalton?

220
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,917
Things have changed!

221
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,719
We're all Wapol's soldiers now,

222
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,755
and any one of you who opposes
Wapol is as good as dead.

223
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,357
[ZORO]
Hey. What's goin' on here?

224
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,859
What's going on here?

225
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,795
[gasps] Wait, what's
goin' on with you?

226
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,630
Why are you dressed like that?

227
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,599
[VILLAGER 4] Dalton is
buried under the snow

228
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,367
that came down
with the avalanche.

229
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,301
[USOPP]
What?!

230
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,769
Dalton's under that?

231
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,305
That's right. And we can't get
over there to dig him out

232
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,608
because those guys
are blocking us.

233
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,577
[PIRATE A]
For the last time... stay back!

234
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,312
But if you really want
to dig your friend up,

235
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,581
I guess you can go ahead
and try fighting us all!

236
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,450
[laughs]

237
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,553
Hey, Usopp. I think I
remember their clothing.

238
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,755
Those are the same exact
guys who attacked our ship

239
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,458
when we were out
in the ocean, right?

240
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,826
Oh, yeah. That's right.

241
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,793
[ZORO]
Then they're the enemy.

242
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,596
Bad guys. Not our friends.
You follow me?

243
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,799
Yeah, but‐‐ Wait a second.
I know that look.

244
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:06,639

brave without Dalton around.

You need to be careful!

250
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,420
Nothing good will come
from attacking them!

251
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:26,091
[ZORO] Ah! This is so warm,
I really like this thing.

252
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,827
[USOPP] That's why you wanted
to know who they were?!

253
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,096
Watch out, Zoro!
They don't look very happy.

254
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,432
[PIRATE F] I know you! You were
on the ship with that guy

255
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,834
who beat up Wapol,
weren't you?

256
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,671

Just like I told
you to do, yeah!

Why are they all so worked up?

I'll explain it
all to you later.

For now, let's just
give 'em a hand.

was the cause of the illness?

Kestia.
