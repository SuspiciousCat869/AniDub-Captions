Ah! You, too?! Vivi,
why are you wearing that?!

up in the desert.

174
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,892
What are those?

175
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,332
[DUGONGS yell]

176
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,400
Turtles?

177
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,568
No, I think they're seals.

178
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,169
Kung Fu Dugongs!

179
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,637
[grunting]

180
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,572
[CHOPPER]
"If you wanna come ashore,

181
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,639
you'll have to beat me first,

182
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,576
but I doubt that'll happen,
you buncha cowards!"

183
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,910
He says.

184
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,946
[USOPP]
Ha.

185
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,982
Nobody calls me a coward
and gets away with it.

186
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,350
Here comes the pain!

187
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,652
[VIVI]
Usopp! No, wait!

188
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,323
Kung Fu Dugongs
are really strong!

189
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,490
[LUFFY yells]

190
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,192
[LUFFY]
See! They're not too tough!

191
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,294
[VIVI]
That's bad, too!

192
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,434
[LUFFY]
Huh? What the‐‐?

193
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,702
It's one of their rules.

194
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,339
If they lose a kung fu match,
they become the winner's pupil.

195
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,207
You don't say...

196
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,311
They think you're
their master now!

197
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,380
Right! Everyone, after me!

198
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,815
Now, punch!

199
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,484
No! Like this!

200
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,220
Yeah! Now... harder!

201
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,656
And now... left!

202
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,825
Left! Right!

203
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,862
Yeah!

204
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,647
Right! All set?!
Let's go to Yuba!

205
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,883
Hey, wait a minute!

206
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,585
You're not bringing
them with us!

207
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,320
Luffy, you can't!

208
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,189
They're water creatures;
they won't make it.

209
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,595
[BOTH]
But they're so cute...

210
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,563
[NAMI] It's gonna break my
heart to say no to them,

211
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,865
but we can't let
them come along.

212
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,402
[VIVI] I agree, but how are we
supposed to get them to stay?

213
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,536
I know!

214
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,538
Hm... let's see.
Where was that thing?

215
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,240
[SANJI]
What are you doing?

216
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,441
[CHOPPER]
Here!

217
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,577
You can have this, but only
if you guys stay here, okay?

218
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,246
[CHOPPER screams]

219
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,213
[CHOPPER]
Somebody! Help me!

220
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,948
Chopper!

221
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:32,558
[LUFFY] Hope all you guys
enjoy the food! See ya!

222
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,561
"All you guys." "Food."
Now do you get it?

223
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,530
No. They said they
wanted to go with us,

224
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,597
so why couldn't we let 'em?

225
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:39,965
We don't have enough
food and water

226
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,034
to take care of
a group that big!

227
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,035
Moron!

228
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,603
Honestly, I don't know
what we would've done

229
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,972
if Chopper hadn't
persuaded them to stay.

230
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,140
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

231
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,376
They kept saying, "Where you
go, we'll follow, Master!"

232
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,444
They really would have, too,

233
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,079
if I hadn't given
them that food!

234
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,614
[SANJI] And now our food
supply's gotten a lot smaller.

235
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,750
Thanks, Luffy, thanks.

236
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,751
He's a handful.

237
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,619
[SANJI]
You're tellin' me.

238
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,224
[ZORO]
Hm?

239
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,325
[USOPP]
Huh?

240
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,231
[SANJI]
What's this?

241
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,734
[LUFFY]
Are we in Yuba already?

242
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,003
No. This is Erumalu.

243
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,107
It was known far and wide
as the "City of Green."

244
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,242
It was green?

245
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,444
Take a good look
around, everyone.

246
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,315
This is what Baroque Works
has been doing to my country.

247
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:33,285
The people of Alabasta, this is
what they've had to go through.

248
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:44,163
[LUFFY] Wow! There's nothing
here at all anymore, huh?

249
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:44,997
[VIVI]
No.

250
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,166
It's nothing but
a ghost town now.

251
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,002
But up until a few short years
ago, it was a thriving city

252
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,606
full of gardens, palm trees,
and lush greenery.

253
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,208
[ZORO]
This place? Hm.

254
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,277
[VIVI]
Rain was always scarce here,

255
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,447
but by saving every last drop
of water and using it wisely,

256
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,350
the city was able to make
the foliage flourish.

257
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,486
Unfortunately, that stopped
when the rain did.

258
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,288
Not a single drop
of water has fallen

259
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,458
in any part of this country
for three years now.

260
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,325
Three years?!

261
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,660
Wow, that long?

262
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,562
But wait, even without rain,

263
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,064
there was still the river
as another water source.

264
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,332
And it's close.

265
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,668
Why couldn't they just pipe
the water in from over there?

266
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,371
Well, the answer to
that is just up ahead.

267
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,705
[USOPP]
Hm?

268
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,043
[VIVI] Even though it's
a desert kingdom,

269
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,579
never in a thousands of years
of Alabasta's history

270
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,848
has the rain ever
stopped completely.

271
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,817
However, there was one
place in the country

272
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,420
where the rain fell more than
usual, much more in fact.

273
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,722
Alubarna, the capital.

274
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,725
The city where the
king's palace is located.

275
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,448
[VIVI] The people of the land
called it the "King's Miracle."

276
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,852
At least, they did until
one particular day.

277
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,854
[SAILOR]
Get that cargo unloaded!

278
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,256
We've got a schedule to keep!

279
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,730
[STRIPED SHIRT]
We're losing it!

280
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,432
Watch out!

281
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,703
[CITIZEN I] What happened?!
Is everyone all right?!

282
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,138
Damn it. What are we
supposed to do now?

283
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,640
It's a delivery for the king.

284
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,775
What's he gonna do when
it doesn't arrive on time?

285
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,711
[CITIZEN J] This green
powder's for the king?

286
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,745
What is it?

287
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,779
[BILLIONS A]
What is it?

288
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,314
How the hell should we know?!

289
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,550
We're only following
your king's orders.

290
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,752
[BILLIONS B]
We're just couriers!

291
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,120
Run!

292
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,493
[CITIZEN K]
Wait a minute. Could this be...?

293
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,295
[NAMI]
Dance Powder?

294
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,298
Oh, so you've heard of it?

295
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,466
Yes.

296
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,269
I sure have. It summons rain.

297
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,436
A powder can?

298
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,305
[NAMI] I've only heard
stories about it,

299
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,841
but apparently, dance powder
was created by a researcher

300
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,809
in a country where
it never rained.

301
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,613
Burning it creates a misty
smoke which rises into the sky.

302
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,182
Once it reaches the clouds,
it causes them to rain.

303
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,651
In essence, it gives
you the ability

304
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,186
to create rain on the spot.

305
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,622
[LUFFY] Oh! I know what
you're talkin' about!

306
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,491
I've seen that stuff before!

307
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,926
I ate some a while back!

308
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,929
It tasted pretty gross,
though! Yuck!

309
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,664
You ate dance powder?

310
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,300
[ZORO] It's not even food;
it's for makin' rain.

311
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,802
Hey! I'm not lying!
I'm telling the truth!

312
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,337
I did eat it, and it
tasted so gross...

313
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,972
Hang on! I don't get it.

314
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,841
Wouldn't that stuff be perfect
for a desert country like this?

315
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,209
You'd think so.

316
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,211
In fact, as its name suggests,

317
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,780
the country that
developed dance powder

318
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,515
was happy enough to dance.

319
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,883
It got lots of rain.

320
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,717
But there was a catch:

321
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,687
Its neighboring country
had a drought.

322
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,488
Let me explain how it works.

323
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,690
Now...

324
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,558
The mist from the
burned dance powder

325
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,394
targets small clouds that
aren't ready to rain yet.

326
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,497
It artificially matures them
into full rain clouds.

327
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,333
Those clouds would
have naturally grown

328
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,200
into rain clouds,

329
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,336
but when they were
further downwind...

330
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,370
[USOPP]
Oh, I get it!

331
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,372
It steals all the rain that
would've normally gone

332
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,640
to a neighboring country!

333
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,508
That musta caused
some big problems!

334
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,843
[NAMI]
Oh, it did.

335
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,412
A war broke out between
the two countries.

336
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,513
Ever since then,

337
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,550
the World Government has
instituted a worldwide ban

338
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,252
on the production and
possession of dance powder.

339
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,990
[USOPP] Even so, some of it
managed to show up here, huh.

340
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,057
When it happened,

341
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,327
the country had been
experiencing strange weather.

342
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,729
There had been no rain.

343
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,832
Not a single drop had fallen
anywhere except one place,

344
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,434
and that was the capital.

345
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,670
[CITIZEN L] No wonder we
haven't had any rain in ages!

346
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,506
The king stole it for the
capital using this dance powder!

347
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,775
[CITIZEN M] So Alubarna's rain
wasn't a miracle at all!

348
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,043
It was a sham!

349
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,746
[CITIZEN N] Yeah! One that's
left us parched and starving!

350
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,582
This is all King Cobra's fault!

351
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,585
Vivi! That means your
dad is the bad guy here!

352
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,754
No! You idiot! He was framed!

353
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,889
[LUFFY]
Ow! Ow!

354
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,291
[SANJI] Her sweet dear old dad
would never do such a thing,

355
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,593
you got it?

356
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,631
Of course. My father didn't
have anything to do with it.

357
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,767
He was innocent.

358
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,603
Unfortunately, a large
amount of dance powder

359
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,806
was discovered inside his
palace shortly thereafter.

360
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,874
[ZORO]
Huh.

361
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,744
They even had people
working inside the palace.

362
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,947
[SANJI]
So... what is this? A road?

363
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,050
No. It used to be a large canal.

364
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,453
It piped in fresh water
from the Sandora River.

365
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,988
Until someone destroyed it.

366
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,956
Now do you see what happened?

367
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,258
With its canal gone,

368
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,629
the City of Green lost its only
remaining source of fresh water.

369
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,298
The people here
waited and prayed,

370
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,434
but sadly, rain never came.

371
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,636
[clatter]

372
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,737
[NAMI]
Wow.

373
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,639
Something like that and
the dance powder incident

374
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,508
would really make people
distrust their king.

375
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,478
[ZORO] That's exactly what
Crocodile planned, I bet.

376
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,813
[VIVI]
With no more water,

377
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,482
fighting began to
break out in Erumalu.

378
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,650
To escape the violence here,

379
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,320
there was only one thing the
exhausted citizens could do.

380
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,788
They abandoned the city

381
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,858
and left for other oases
in search of water.

382
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,462
And then...

383
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,766
[VIVI] ...the City of
Green withered away.

384
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,705
[howling]

385
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,716
What... is that?

386
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,817
Is it the rebels?

387
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,454
Or more of those creeps from
Baroque Works. Oh, no!

388
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,531
No. It's just wind.

389
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,500
Sounds like a voice, right?

390
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,201
Oh, man. It's coming
from all directions!

391
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,636
This isn't good!

392
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,238
Ace, what are we gonna do?!

393
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,039
There's no danger.

394
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,975
It's just the wind blowing
around the town

395
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,744
and echoing off
the old buildings.

396
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,649
It's like...

397
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,751
It's like the city of
Erumalu is wailing

398
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,987
over what's happened to it.

399
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,060
[NAMI]
Watch out!

400
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,543
[gasps]

401
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,122
[USOPP]
Whoa!

402
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,925
What's the deal with
that freaky wind?

403
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,295
Someone's collapsed!

404
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,598
Wait, you mean there are still
people living in this city?!

405
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,310
[VIVI]
What did my father...

406
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,212
...and all of the
other good people...

407
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,215
...what did they ever do?

408
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
They don't deserve this.

409
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,818
It's hard enough to
live in the desert.

410
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,221
Every day, it's a struggle
just to survive.

411
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,823
Somehow the people of Alabasta
found a way to do it

412
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,825
and they led happy lives!

413
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,561
But Crocodile
destroyed those lives!

414
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,598
What gives him the right
to do that?! What?!

415
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,800
All the while, as one
of the Seven Warlords,

416
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,603
he passes himself off
as a hero of the people!

417
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,137
They don't know what
he's really doing!

418
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,273
No one realizes that
he's actually deceiving

419
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,743
the entire country,
even as they cheer him on!

420
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,079
[CROWD]
Crocodile! Crocodile!

421
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,948
Crocodile! Crocodile!

422
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,919
I can't! I can't let
him get away with this!

423
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,687
[LUFFY yells]

424
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,598
Oh, well... Hope that
made him feel better.

425
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,777
[LUFFY]

I'm itchin' to do this!

428
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,953
[NAMI]
He's right. Let's get to Yuba.

429
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:31,790
That's where the rebel
army is, right? Yuba?

430
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,125
Yes, I have to stop them.

431
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm going to persuade
their leader.

432
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,295
How so?

433
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,130
I'll tell the rebel
leader the truth,

434
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,632
that all of this is
Crocodile's doing,

435
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,036
and have him stop all of
this pointless bloodshed.

436
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,737
Let's go.

00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,966

Take off that animal suit.

making fun of reindeer?!

455
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,105
