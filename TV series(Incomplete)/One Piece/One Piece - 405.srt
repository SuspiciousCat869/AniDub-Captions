1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,558
[USOPP whimpers]

38
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,361
[KUMA]
Stand down, PX-1.

39
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,038
[BROOK gasps]

40
00:02:52,071 --> 00:03:00,613
[ZORO grunting]

41
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:05,385
[ZORO]
It's him. The real Kuma.

42
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,491
[KUMA]
I see you survived, Roronoa.

43
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,794
Hey, Zoro. C'mon!

44
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,096
Let's get out of
here while we can!

45
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,468
Huh?

46
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,242
Is he gone?

47
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,410
No.

48
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,712
What happened? Where is he?

49
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,252
Zoro... He just disappeared.

50
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,834
[LUFFY]
Eliminated Friends.

51
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,604
The Final Day of
the Straw Hat Crew.

52
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,557
[USOPP]
Z-Zoro...

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,660
[USOPP whimpering]

54
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,369
He's gone! What the
hell did you do to him?

55
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,372
You! Where is he?

56
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,141
You bring him back
here, you monster!

57
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,713
[LUFFY panting]

58
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,518
[LUFFY]
Zoro...

59
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,854
What did you do?

60
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,490
[LUFFY]
Zoro...

61
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,593
No!

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,796
Zoro!

63
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,231
[CHOPPER growling]

[ROBIN grunting]

67
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:12,445
Chopper, stop this!
You've lost control!

68
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,849
Zoro! Where the hell are you?

69
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:21,821

[CHOPPER roaring]

71
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,941
This beast has gone mad but
that's not what worries me.

72
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,345
I wanna know what
he's doing here.

73
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,886
Well, Bartholomew Kuma.

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,588
Can't trust pirates.

75
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,659
The Seven Warlords are
supposed to be at Navy HQ.

76
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,263
I wish I could help, but
there's nothing I can do.

77
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,699
[FRANKY]
It's like Zoro was erased.

78
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,203
I'm gonna guess that means
this guy is the real Kuma.

79
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,604
There's no question.

80
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,707
That power he used,
I've seen it before.

81
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,777
Back on Thriller Bark.
He erased a girl like that.

82
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,514
Just made her disappear and
that was the last I saw of her.

83
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,225
[FRANKY grunts]

84
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,928
Let's just hope
he's still alive.

85
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,731
Hey! What the hell'd
that guy do to Zoro?

86
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,600
Where is he?

87
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,869
You think I'm gonna answer you?

88
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,572
Did you forget I'm the
world's most guarded man?

89
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,775
But someone might tell
you he can send you

90
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,744
flying for three days and
nights with those paw pads.

91
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,313
Can't say if it's true or
not but that's the rumor.

92
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,281
[LUFFY gasps]

93
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,483
[SENTOMARU]
Only Kuma knows where they go.

94
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,619
But there's no way you're
going to find your friend

95
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:00,920
on these islands.

96
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,290
Or anywhere else around
here, for that matter.

97
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,427
He'll probably land on
the other side of the world.

98
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,594
What?

99
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,968
[SANJI groaning]

100
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,338
[USOPP] Say something,
dammit, tell us what you did!

101
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,308
[USOPP]
Tell us where you sent Zoro!

102
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,744
So that's the real deal, huh?

103
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,914
The first three were bad
enough and now he shows up

104
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,950
to finish the job.
There's no way to win.

105
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,686
What kind of power is that?

106
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,995
[USOPP whimpers]
Stop it! Get back!

107
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,832
[USOPP whimpers]

108
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,433
[beeping]

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,703
[USOPP]
No! You stay away from me!

110
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,339
I've-I've got 8,000 men
under my command!

111
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,675
Don't make me
unleash them on you!

112
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,678
Usopp, he's behind
you! Get down!

113
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,446
Oh, cra--!

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,786
Usopp, no!

115
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,962
[KUMA]
Don't interfere.

116
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,069
[BROOK gasps]

117
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,905
He erased him. But why?

118
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,016
[SENTOMARU]
That was PX-1 he just hit.

119
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,353
What's your problem,
you fool? That was your ally!

120
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,055
[USOPP whimpering]

121
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,992
Just run! Move you guys!

123
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,495
[LUFFY]
Just go! Get out of there!

124
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:55,034
We can figure out a plan
once we're safe! Run!

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,908
Alright, you heard him!

126
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,142
But, Zoro...

127
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,077
The captain just said
we can figure it out

128
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,547
after we're safe! C'mon!

129
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,483
[USOPP]
C'mon buddy!

130
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,654
That last beam just grazed
me. I can help you walk.

131
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,822
[BROOK] Go, you two!
I'll cover you!

132
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,359
[USOPP]
Stop it, Brook! That's crazy!

133
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:29,168
I'll protect you, even
if it costs me my life!

134
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,003
Oh, but I'm already
dead, I suppo--

135
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,910
Brook! No!

136
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,453
That bastard did it again!

[SANJI]
Dammit!

138
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,823
How the hell can
I let this happen?

139
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,226
The bastard's erasing all of
my friends right in front of me!

140
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,195
[SANJI grunts]
Get back!

141
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,397
Sanji?

142
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,166
Start running, Usopp.

143
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,400
Not a chance!

144
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,502
I'm not going
without you, Sanji!

145
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,071
Son of a bitch!

146
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,907
Sanji! Just run!

147
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,444
C'mon! Nobody does
that to my crewmates!

No! Stop it!

Damn you!

You can't win! Don't fight!

168
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,394
[LUFFY]
He got Sanji. What now?

169
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,897
What do we do?

170
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,833
It can't be. They're all gone.

171
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,008
It's startin' to sound
like they could really use

172
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,210
my help over there,
but there's only so much

173
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,012
an old man can do.

174
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,514
I guess I'm not quite
the fighter I used to be.

175
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,117
So fending off a navy
admiral isn't enough

176
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,152
to make you satisfied, huh?

177
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,221
Why don't you keep those
thoughts to yourself?

178
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,057
You're already making
me look bad, y'know!

180
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,566
[RAYLEIGH panting]

181
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,267
[KUMA]
Dark King Rayleigh, correct?

182
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,469
Huh?

183
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,941
Huh? Kuma?

184
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,378
[RAYLEIGH]
Hm?

185
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,116
[LUFFY grunting, panting]

186
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,017
[ROBIN]
Wait, Luffy.

187
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,286
[RAYLEIGH]
You can't be serious.

188
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,889
You're asking me to trust you?

189
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,191
[KUMA]
That's entirely your decision.

190
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,528
But I'm putting my own
neck on the line too.

191
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,529
Alright.

192
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:48,067
I feel like I deserve an
explanation here, Kuma.

193
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,970
[KUMA] This matter is of no
consequence to the government.

194
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,007
So, I have no obligation
to cooperate with the Navy.

195
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,309
And you deserve
nothing of the sort.

196
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,111
[LUFFY]
You bastard!

197
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,215
Now. Second Gear!

198
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,483
Luffy!

199
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,218
[FRANKY]
Let's move it!

200
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,160
[NAMI, FRANKY gasp]

201
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,195
Get the hell out of our way!

202
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,230
Strong Right!

203
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,002
[FRANKY]
What the--?

204
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,570
[LUFFY yells]

205
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,240
Luffy! No!

206
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,276
Now Gum-Gum...

207
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,611
Jet Pistol!

208
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,084
[LUFFY yells]

209
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,293
Luffy!

210
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,327
[FRANKY yelps]

211
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,463
[NAMI screams]

212
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:56,135
[NAMI whimpering]

213
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,540
Someone help me!

214
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,276
[LUFFY]
Nami!

215
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:39,211
[LUFFY panting]

216
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,014
Someone help me--

217
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,716
[LUFFY growls]

218
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:54,727
[LUFFY yelling]

219
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,163
Luffy!

220
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:04,703
[CHOPPER roars]

221
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,339
Chopper, no!

222
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:11,477
[CHOPPER roars]

223
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:32,598
[CHOPPER roaring, growling]

224
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,534
Chopper, no! Don't do it!

225
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,270
[CHOPPER roars]

226
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,178
[LUFFY sputtering]

227
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,382
[LUFFY]
Damn it.

228
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,200
[ROBIN grunting]

229
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,137
No more. Please, stop.

230
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,307
Please, stop. Just stop.

231
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,209
Please, stop.

232
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,117
Stop it, leave her alone!

233
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,553
[LUFFY yelling]

234
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,188
[ROBIN]
Luffy!

235
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,824
Robin!

236
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,393
Luffy!

237
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,571
[LUFFY gasping]

238
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:12,364
[LUFFY grunting, sobbing]

239
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:25,911
[LUFFY grunting, sobbing]

240
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,546
[LUFFY]
How could I?

241
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,784
I'm useless. How could I?

242
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,595
[LUFFY]
I got a question. You ready?

243
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,665
Will you join our crew?

244
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:25,737
[BROOK sobbing]

245
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,842
've never been this
happy in my life!

246
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,813
Come on, Straw Hat,
you can't hide from me!

247
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,819
[LUFFY]
Well? Come on!

248
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,688
Get on my ship!

249
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,323
Captain's orders.

250
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,424
What can I say?

251
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,859
You don't leave me much choice.

252
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,328
I gotta take care of my
masterpiece, after all!

253
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,730
So set sail--
I'm joining the crew!

254
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,999
Why did you come to save
me in the first place?

255
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,601
[ROBIN]
Do you hear me?

256
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,303
I just want to die!

257
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,740
[LUFFY] There's still
something I wanna hear you say!

258
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,778
Tell me you wanna live!

259
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,848
I want to live!

260
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,484
[CHOPPER] Shut up!
Even if I don't have friends,

261
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,287
I can still fight for
something I believe in!

262
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,990
[LUFFY] You're wrong!
You do have friends!

263
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,926
I'm your friend, reindeer! Me!

264
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,831
[CHOPPER] I am going
to stay here for now...

265
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,834
...but if you wanted to,
you could stop by here again.

266
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,939
[LUFFY]
Shut up! Let's go!

267
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,340
[NAMI]
What do you want?

268
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,943
You don't know
anything about this.

269
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,812
This has nothing
to do with you!

270
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:45,984
I told you to leave this place.

271
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,289
Luffy, help me.

272
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,060
[LUFFY]
Hey! Nami,

273
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,330
You'll always be my friend!

274
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,598
[SANJI]
Wait.

275
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,734
Your dream is foolish.
Then again, so is mine.

276
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,869
[LUFFY gasps]

277
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,903
[SANJI]
You hear me?

278
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,506
I wanna be the
cook on your ship.

279
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,443
Thanks, you geezer!

280
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,346
I owe my life
to you, old man!

281
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,682
What are you talking
about? Get on already!

282
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,382
Huh?

283
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,352
We're friends, right? So get on.

284
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,722
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

285
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,023
Bullet!

286
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,628
[LUFFY]
You idiot.

287
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,830
You knew it would end like this!

288
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,600
You knew you
could never beat me!

289
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,635
[USOPP]
I'll do anything!

290
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:41,506
Please, let me join the crew.
Just one more time!

291
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,507
[USOPP whimpers]

292
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,613
Hurry up! Grab on already!

293
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,517
Scars on the back are
a swordsman's shame.

294
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,755
[ZORO]
I will never, ever be defeated!

295
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,924
Is that okay?

296
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,794
[ZORO]
King of the pirates?

297
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,964
[LUFFY]
Zoro...

298
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,399
Usopp...

299
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,767
Sanji...

300
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,035
Nami...

301
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,670
Chopper...

302
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,971
Robin...

303
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,606
Franky...

304
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,841
Brook...

305
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,711
They're... They're all gone.

306
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:28,954
[LUFFY sobbing]

307
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,523
I couldn't save any of them.

308
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,159
What's wrong with me?

309
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:41,166
[LUFFY sobbing]

310
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:46,538
[KIZARU] So, you're just gonna
blast him off like the rest?

311
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:53,011
You can't pull this mess without
an explanation, you know.

312
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,481
And boy, it had
better be a good one.

313
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:06,058
[LUFFY sobbing]

314
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,459
[KUMA]
You and I...

315
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,227
We'll never meet again.

316
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,530
[LUFFY growls]

317
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,173
Farewell, Straw Hat.

318
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,612
[LUFFY growls]

319
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,762
[NARRATOR] Grove 12.
The Sabaody Archipelago.

320
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,898
Deep in the Grand Line.

321
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,033
On this day,

322
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,103
the Straw Hat Pirates, led
by Captain Monkey D. Luffy

323
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:56,942
came face to face
with true despair.

324
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:01,012
And one by one,
they were eliminated.

325
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,190
[LUFFY]
That was harsh.

326
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,893
I think I could use a
break from serious stuff.

327
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,261
[NAMI]
Lucky for you, we've got

328
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,496
a Boss Luffy episode up next.

329
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,265
Everyone's taking to the streets
for a portable shrine race!

330
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,934
I hear first prize is
a sacred treasure!

331
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,238
[LUFFY] Mm. Sacred
treasure. Sounds yummy.

332
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,539
[NAMI]
It's not food!

333
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,640
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.

334
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,544
"Feudal Era Side Story--
Boss Luffy Appears Again!".

335
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,746
I'm gonna be a police man!
