00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:46.332
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.144
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:54.048
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:56.353
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:59.192
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.969
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:13.219
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.127
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.764
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:20.668
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:24.441
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.716
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.422
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:33.827
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.365
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.303
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.336 --> 00:03:41.408
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:45.150
[NARRATOR]
But the tale of Law, Doflamingo,

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.589
and his younger brother Corazon

00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:52.064
began 16 years ago,
when Law was still a child.

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:55.203
Stricken with a terminal illness
and angry at the world,

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:57.140
Law joined the
Don Quixote Family,

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:59.412
until Corazon
betrayed Doflamingo

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:01.717
to give Law the Op-Op Fruit.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.620
[ROSINANTE]
Not yet.

00:04:05.658 --> 00:04:08.730
[ROSINANTE] I have to survive
just a little bit longer.

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:13.607
[ROSINANTE]
Because if I die now,

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:17.481
the spell I cast will be
broken in an instant.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:22.224
[ROSINANTE] And if you cry
or make a single noise,

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:25.497
anyone on the island
might hear it.

00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.471
[ROSINANTE]
Pick yourself up, Law.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:32.912
Go silently. Unseen.

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:36.453
Farther and farther.

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.626
There's nothing to
bind you down anymore.

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:43.366
[ROSINANTE] Not the iron
borders of White Town,

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.105
or the sickness
that hounded you.

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:48.810
Your life is finally your own.

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:54.822
[ROSINANTE]
So don't be sad.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.362
[ROSINANTE]
You're free now.

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:05.578
[sobbing]

00:05:11.824 --> 00:05:18.837
[sobbing]

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:27.120
[screaming]

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.824
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:05:52.404 --> 00:05:54.041
[TREBOL gasps]

00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:08.370
[panting]

00:06:08.403 --> 00:06:11.241
What's wrong?
Is that all you've got?

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:13.312
You acted so tough,
but in the end,

00:06:13.346 --> 00:06:16.620
you played right into
my hands, didn't you?

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.730
Finally, you're mine.

00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:25.037
I came here of my own free will!

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.040
Don't flatter yourself!

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:30.380
"Your own will"?

00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:31.950
I told you!

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:36.091
I'm here to take revenge for
what happened 13 years ago!

00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:41.468
To fulfill his
dying wish, finally!

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:43.941
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
I know!

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:48.116
That's just what I
expected you to do, Law!

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.220
That crap you call "free will."

00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:51.657
"Freedom."

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.295
It all belongs to me!

00:06:54.328 --> 00:06:56.498
[LAW]
That's enough!

00:06:56.533 --> 00:06:58.036
[LAW]
Cora.

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.440
He has nothing to
gain from someone

00:07:00.473 --> 00:07:02.845
who only longs for destruction.

00:07:02.878 --> 00:07:04.448
He's above that.

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:06.653
So you leave him the hell alone.

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:09.993
'Cause Law's finally free now!

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:18.309
[LAW] I still haven't been able
to fulfill your hopes for me.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:20.914
But that's what
I'm here to settle!

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:22.151
[LAW]
Room!

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.724
[LAW]
I'll finally stop Doflamingo!

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:40.086
[LUFFY panting]

00:07:47.636 --> 00:07:50.307
All right. Let's end this!

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.079
I'm sick of you, Fake Mingo!

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.089
Pentachromatic Strings!

00:07:58.122 --> 00:08:00.060
Bullet String!

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:04.001
[gasps] Okay. I got you now!

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:05.871
Gum-Gum...

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:11.683
[BELLAMY]
Please, stop it!

00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:15.557
Let Bellamy go and
fight me for real, Mingo!

00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:19.632
I'll wipe that smile
off your face!

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.204
Armament Hardening!

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:25.343
[LAW]
What do make of Monkey D. Luffy?

00:08:25.376 --> 00:08:26.713
I have to ask you!

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:27.716
Huh?

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.853
[LAW] You were once
a Celestial Dragon.

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:33.059
You must have something
interesting to say.

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:34.595
Shambles!

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:39.839
[LAW] What do make of
the "Will of D."?

00:08:54.703 --> 00:08:56.807
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why should I indulge you?

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.813
That's none of your concern!

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.883
You think that this is his fate?

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:05.490
Huh? That Straw Hat
was lead here?

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:10.668
My divine blood enticed
him to come and kill me?

00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:13.038
A bunch of nonsense!

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:17.380
[ROSINANTE]
One more thing.

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:19.251
Those who fear
the inheritors of D.

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:21.055
have given them another title.

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:23.927
"Sworn enemy of gods"!

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.198
I'm also a "D."!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.367
Huh?

00:09:36.218 --> 00:09:39.224
Can you update me on
the situation, Viola?

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:42.798
Sadly, things are not
going well at the palace.

00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:45.704
Straw Hat has been
knocked below.

00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:49.110
Law is struggling
against Doflamingo.

00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:53.286
Still, that is not
the only battle.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.824
There are two more.

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:59.297
In addition to the clashes on
the Plateau and at the palace,

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:02.370
there are also battles
near the statue of Pica,

00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:04.676
and at the SMILE Factory.

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:06.279
[MARINE A]
The fire is spreading!

00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:07.682
[TOWNSMAN A]
Don't do it!

00:10:07.715 --> 00:10:10.286
Try to restrain them, hurry!

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:14.295
The victims keep piling up.

00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:16.733
We must end this.

00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:19.104
Viola.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.281
We've defeated some of
the Executives, right?

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:27.387
So how many of them are left?

00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:29.357
[VIOLET]
Quite a few, I'm afraid.

00:10:30.694 --> 00:10:32.631
[VIOLET] As I mentioned,
the SMILE Factory

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:34.702
is one of the
major battlefields,

00:10:34.735 --> 00:10:37.542
and it's still protected
by the Free-Swimming Man,

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.311
SeÃ±or Pink.

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:46.325
[VIOLET]
And there's a Top Executive

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:48.730
fighting on the giant statue.

00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:55.443
[VIOLET] The Stone-
Assimilation Man, Pica.

00:10:56.513 --> 00:11:00.888
And then, of course, there's
the center of our struggle.

00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:03.259
On the top level of the plateau.

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:09.805
[VIOLET] There lies the despot
king and String Man, Doflamingo.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.813
[chuckles]

00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:19.792
[VIOLET] With him is his chief
of staff, the Mucus Man, Trebol.

00:11:21.062 --> 00:11:24.802
[VIOLET] In the Sunflower Field,
directly below the palace,

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:26.940
there's the hero
of the coliseum,

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:30.346
known as the Flag Man, Diamante!

00:11:32.383 --> 00:11:34.589
[VIOLET] Beneath them,
on the third level,

00:11:34.623 --> 00:11:36.391
is the Rupture Man.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.466
[VIOLET]
Gladius!

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:45.309
[VIOLET] There are four
Executives on the second level.

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:50.453
[VIOLET] The half fighting
fish Fishman, Dellinger.

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:55.496
[VIOLET]
The Geo-Fist master, Lao G.

00:11:57.835 --> 00:11:59.939
[VIOLET]
The Super Weight Man.

00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:03.212
[VIOLET]
Machvise!

00:12:06.252 --> 00:12:10.927
[VIOLET] And the
Full-Body Weapon, Baby 5!

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.208
Altogether, that's ten
Executives to face.

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:31.134
[grunts]

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:44.294
Ha. Was that a breeze
that tickled me?

00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:47.300
[CAT A meows]

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.402
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.108
[CAT A meows]

00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:55.383
Wait, did you...

00:12:57.153 --> 00:12:58.455
[CAT A meows]

00:12:59.391 --> 00:13:02.296
[meows]

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.417
That breeze is hurting
my tear ducts man.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.458
[WOMEN]
Wow! So hard-boiled!

00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:19.932
[ZORO grunting]

00:13:24.943 --> 00:13:27.548
[VIOLET] But these battles
are wearing on.

00:13:28.984 --> 00:13:32.156
[VIOLET] And many of the
fighters are already injured.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:38.235
[VIOLET] So the end of this
battle may be close at hand.

00:13:56.539 --> 00:14:02.050
[LUFFY yelling]

00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:09.599
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] You're not
going anywhere, Straw Hat.

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:10.768
You're mine now!

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:12.504
[LUFFY yells]

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.288
[LUFFY yells]

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.137
[chuckles]

00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:33.780
[DOFLAMINGO]
Go on! Don't just stand there!

00:14:33.813 --> 00:14:35.416
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:51.549
[KYROS yells]

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.567
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:06.111
Be careful!

00:15:08.348 --> 00:15:10.019
[KYROS grunts]

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:18.068
[panting]

00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:23.378
You're a real pain.

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:31.194
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:42.083
Army Bandera!

00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:57.381
[KYROS gasps]

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.552
[REBECCA]
The ground! What's happening?

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.087
[REBECCA gasps]

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:04.862
[DIAMANTE cackles]
Like that?

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:07.300
I can even make
the ground ripple!

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:10.339
Seems hard to stand
with one leg!

00:16:12.811 --> 00:16:16.519
[DIAMANTE cackles]

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.436
[chuckles]

00:16:26.539 --> 00:16:27.307
And Clutch!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.843
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES groan]

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:30.179
[ROBIN]
We let Rebecca go ahead,

00:16:30.212 --> 00:16:31.849
but I hope she's
all right on her own.

00:16:31.882 --> 00:16:35.389
The enemies above us are all
strong beyond imagination.

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.966
[BARTOLOMEO]
You should go up, Miss Robin!

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.303
I know you're worried
about your friends.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:44.609
I can handle this
place on my own.

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:45.811
Are you sure?

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.081
[BARTOLOMEO]
Yeah! Go on!

00:16:48.817 --> 00:16:53.058
Thanks. Now, Pierna Fleurs!

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:07.555
[BARTOLOMEO]
What an honor.

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:10.326
I get to protect Miss Robin
from her enemies!

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.664
It's like when the Straw Hats
rescued her from Enies Lobby!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.938
Only this time, I'm here
as an honorary crewmate!

00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:18.510
Okay, okay, sorry,
that's a bit much!

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:20.580
I got carried away!

00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:27.293
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES groan]

00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:36.980
Fools! Such feeble attacks!

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.051
Almost put me to sleep!

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:41.321
En garde, Gladius!

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:52.410
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.320
[DELLINGER laughs]

00:17:58.256 --> 00:18:01.227
Destruction Cannon!

00:18:01.862 --> 00:18:04.635
[DELLINGER]
You missed me!

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:07.206
[HAJRUDIN grunts]

00:18:17.293 --> 00:18:24.407
[MACHVISE]
Ten-Ton... Vise!

00:18:25.577 --> 00:18:27.881
[HAJRUDIN groans]

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.994
[chuckles]

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:36.197
[BABY 5 yells]

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:42.778
This next blow will strike
straight through your heart!

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.748
[BABY 5 gasps]
I see!

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.359
[BABY 5]
You do want me, don't you?

00:18:50.393 --> 00:18:51.796
Huh?

00:18:51.829 --> 00:18:56.839
[LAO G grunting]

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:00.914
[CHIN JAO groans]

00:19:04.387 --> 00:19:07.326
Lao G!

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.199
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yell]

00:19:13.072 --> 00:19:16.679
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES groan]

00:19:17.815 --> 00:19:21.856
We're on our way!
Stay strong, Princess!

00:19:33.613 --> 00:19:35.383
[PICA yells]

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:38.088
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style!

00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:41.261
Hundred Eight Caliber Phoenix!

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:53.987
He ran away. Pissin' me off.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.963
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:02.504
[TOWNSMAN B] Run!
The building's gonna fall on us!

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:07.581
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:09.317
Fire Fist!

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:27.120
You all right, ma'am?

00:20:27.153 --> 00:20:29.992
Yes! You showed up just in time!

00:20:30.026 --> 00:20:32.965
Thank you! You're awesome!

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:35.202
Better get someplace
safe. Hurry.

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:36.572
[TOWNSWOMAN A, TOWNSGIRL A]
Okay!

00:20:41.248 --> 00:20:43.719
[SABO]
Though nowhere is safe, really.

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:08.068
I said the end was near.
And that's true.

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:12.511
But defeating the Executives
doesn't mean victory.

00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:16.853
[VIOLET] If Luffy and Law
cannot stop Doflamingo,

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:20.661
the people in the Birdcage
will never be freed.

00:21:20.694 --> 00:21:22.998
The fate of the kingdom
is in the hands of

00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:25.435
two pirates and that's it?

00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:41.167
You're a "D."?
You have a hidden name?

00:21:41.835 --> 00:21:44.440
And you're destined to
come here and defeat me--

00:21:44.474 --> 00:21:46.879
Is that what you're
trying to say?

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:52.323
I did it! Hm?

00:21:52.357 --> 00:21:53.491
[DOFLAMINGO]
You think you can stop me

00:21:53.526 --> 00:21:55.563
because of some
letter in your name?

00:21:55.597 --> 00:21:59.037
That you're the sworn enemy
of the gods, driven by fate?

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.172
That's rubbish!

00:22:00.206 --> 00:22:01.408
A legend!

00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:03.378
Just a lie!

00:22:05.182 --> 00:22:06.920
Whoa! Doffy!

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:08.288
Be careful!

00:22:08.322 --> 00:22:11.228
You're in range of
his power right now!

00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:12.931
[LAW]
Injection...

00:22:15.504 --> 00:22:16.939
[LAW]
...Shot!

00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:26.291
[LAW] Cora knew that
it would take more than

00:22:26.324 --> 00:22:28.696
a measly "D." to defeat you.

00:22:28.729 --> 00:22:31.368
And yet, when I
learned the truth,

00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:34.006
my fate changed all the same.

00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:38.916
My name was the catalyst.

00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:43.593
You point that gun,
but I know you can't shoot me.

00:22:43.627 --> 00:22:47.132
Because in the end,
you're just like your father.

00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:51.107
Listen.

00:22:52.744 --> 00:22:54.548
[ROSINANTE]
I love you, kid!

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:57.453
[ROSINANTE chuckles]

00:22:57.487 --> 00:22:59.692
[LAW] I'm only here because
Cora was too kindhearted

00:22:59.725 --> 00:23:01.763
to pull the trigger that day.

00:23:01.796 --> 00:23:05.670
So now, I'm going
to do it for him!

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.358
[NARRATOR]
His emotions laid bare,

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:19.665
Law begins his final
assault on Doflamingo.

00:23:19.699 --> 00:23:22.671
However, the wicked king
meets his fierce attacks

00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:24.340
with a grin on his face,

00:23:24.374 --> 00:23:27.146
and the determination
that Cora granted Law

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:29.685
threatens to
wither into despair.

00:23:29.719 --> 00:23:31.656
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.689 --> 00:23:35.396
"An Intense Battle!
Law vs. Doflamingo!"

00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:38.736
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
