178
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,252
Any doctor will do.

179
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,586
Where is this witch of yours.

180
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,621
The witch...?

181
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,357
Do you see those mountains
outside the window?

182
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,193
Yeah... I noticed them earlier.

183
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,129
[LUFFY]
Super Massive Snowman!

184
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,431
[USOPP] And the feared
snow beast, Snowzilla!

185
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,599
[LUFFY]
Yes!

186
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,102
Get in here before I kill you!

187
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,771
[DALTON]
Those mountains out there

188
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,740
are known as the Drum Rockies.

189
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,441
Look closely...

190
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,777
Do you see the castle
on top of the tallest one,

191
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,611
the one in the middle?

192
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,779
Castle?

193
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,614
[DALTON]
That castle has lost its king.

194
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,415
Much warmer!

195
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,584
[SANJI]
Yeah... I see it up there.

196
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,619
[VIVI] What's so important
about the castle?

197
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,622
[DALTON] That castle is where
our land's only doctor lives...

198
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,291
Dr. Kureha...

199
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,393
She's the one who
people here call a witch.

200
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,627
[SANJI]
What?!

201
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,896
Of all places, why does she have
to live on top of a mountain?

202
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,932
We need to call
her here right now.

203
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,500
Nami needs her help.

204
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,634
[DALTON]
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid

205
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,936
there's no way to contact her.

206
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,469
[SANJI]
Huh?

207
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,171
You can't be serious...

208
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,940
What kind of doctor is she?!

209
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,509
Her skills as a doctor are
quite impressive, actually...

210
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,744
However, she's an
eccentric old woman...

211
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,681
She's nearly one hundred
and forty years old now.

212
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,448
Huh...?

213
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,316
[SANJI]
A hundred and forty...!

214
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,484
No wonder she doesn't
get around much.

215
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,819
[DALTON]
Oh, and one more thing...

216
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,588
She likes pickled plums.

217
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,823
[VIVI] What happens when
people here get sick or injured?

218
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,024
Doesn't she help them?

219
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,927
She comes down from the mountain
whenever she feels like it.

220
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,529
She looks around for patients.

221
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,496
She treats them.

222
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,332
Then... before she leaves,

223
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,335
she takes whatever she wants
from their houses as payment.

224
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,470
She doesn't sound
like a very nice lady.

225
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,939
It kinda sounds
like she's a pirate.

226
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,708
But how is a woman
as old as she is

227
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,277
capable of getting
down that mountain.

228
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,546
It's an odd rumor around here...

229
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,449
But several of the villagers
claim they've seen her at night,

230
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,718
riding a sleigh of some
kind through the sky...

231
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,020
They see her silhouette
when the moon is out.

232
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,222
[KUREHA cackles]

233
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,658
[DALTON] That's the reason
she is thought to be a witch.

234
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,960
There are others
who say they've seen her

235
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,795
with a strange creature.

236
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,964
A creature that none
of 'em recognize...

237
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,499
See...! I knew it!

238
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,533
A snow monster!

239
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,002
Where there's snow there's
gotta be snow monsters!

240
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,370
Oh, I knew there'd be one!

241
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,304
Oh no...!

242
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,539
Oh... no...! Oh... no...!

243
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,807
I don't wanna run into one...

244
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,676
[sobs]

245
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,345
Dr. Kureha is the
only doctor we have,

246
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,348
but she's still a woman I would
prefer to stay away from.

247
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,484
All we can do is wait
for the next time she decides

248
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,019
to come down the mountain.

249
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,487
Really?!

250
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,321
No, damn it.

251
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,390
We can't wait
here for that long.

252
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,659
Nami is getting even
worse as we speak.

253
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,726
Hey, Nami...

254
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,495
Nami... Wake up now.

255
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,598
Luffy, you idiot,
what are you doing to her?!

256
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,902
[LUFFY]
Hey...! Look, she's awake.

257
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,070
Here's the thing...

258
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,272
The only way to see the doctor
is to climb the mountain.

259
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,575
So we're gonna have
to climb the mountain.

260
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,410
[SANJI]
Are you crazy?

261
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,277
What about Nami?

262
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,679
How do you expect
to get her up there?

263
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,414
Easy. She'll ride on my back.

264
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,050
[VIVI] That's only going
to make her even more sick!

265
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,284
[LUFFY]
What's the problem?

266
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,786
I thought we needed to hurry.

267
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,621
We do, but you'll never
make it up there...

268
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,890
Look at how steep
and tall that thing is!

269
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:31,791
[LUFFY]
I can do it.

270
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,925
[SANJI]
Maybe you can,

271
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,361
but climbing that thing
would be way too hard on Nami!

272
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,430
[LUFFY] But look,
even if we fall or something,

273
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,431
we'll land in snow!

274
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,532
[VIVI]
That doesn't matter!

275
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,767
A fall like that would kill
even a healthy person!

276
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,737
[USOPP] Seriously, Luffy,
she has a really bad fever...

277
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,572
It's so high,
she's almost dying...

278
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,741
Don't you understand that?!

279
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,082
[NAMI]
I need to get over this thing...

280
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,416
...and quickly.

281
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,620
[NAMI]
We need to hurry...

282
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,456
...for Vivi.

283
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,061
Come on... Captain...

284
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,730
Let's go...

285
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,934
That's what I'm talking about...

286
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,769
Leave it to me.

287
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,622
[USOPP]
I can't believe this.

288
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,825
Now our navigator's as
crazy as our captain...

289
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,993
[SANJI]
You know you're in no shape

290
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,294
for a trip like this, Nami.

291
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,763
[VIVI]
Are you sure you'll be okay?

292
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,097
It'll take you
hours to get there.

293
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,166
[LUFFY] Hey, old guy,
gimme some meat for the road.

294
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,267
[DALTON]
Meat?

295
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,103
Right... I'm coming too.

296
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,371
Listen, Luffy...

297
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,472
Be very careful.

298
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,775
You can't fall even once,
or Nami is going to die!

299
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,643
Aw! Not even once?

300
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,811
[VIVI]
Hold still a second...

301
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,713
I need to make
sure that this is tight.

302
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,949
Okay, you're all set...

303
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,184
I'm going to
wait for you here.

304
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,820
If I came with you guys,
I'd only get in the way.

305
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:08,954
[USOPP]
Yep... me too.

306
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,356
[LUFFY]
All right.

307
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,026
Now you just hold on
tight to me, kay Nami?

308
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,294
[NAMI]
Mm.

309
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,197
[DALTON]
I guess you're set on going.

310
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,031
Huh?

311
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,299
I'm not going
to try to stop you,

312
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,035
but I will ask you to at least
climb up from the other side.

313
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,405
That way you can avoid the
Lapins that are on this side.

314
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,808
They're fierce,
carnivorous rabbits.

315
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,010
If you run into a pack of 'em,
you're as good as dead.

316
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:31,744
Huh?

317
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,478
Really...?

318
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,046
But we've gotta get up there...

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,147
We'll be just fine...

320
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,148
Right?

321
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,683
Yeah... fine.

322
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,084
[DALTON]
You can't be serious...

323
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,020
Do you know how easily
those things can kill you?

324
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,254
[LUFFY]
Nah, we'll be all right...

325
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,090
Now hurry it up,
Sanji, before Nami dies!

326
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:45,925
[SANJI grunts]

327
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,893
Don't say stuff like
that, you idiot!

328
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,196
Do you want to jinx us?!

329
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,166
[DALTON] Are you
sure they'll be all right?

330
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,901
[USOPP]
Well, it's not really those two

331
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,670
we need to worry about.

332
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,205
[VIVI]
Nami's the one in trouble.

333
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,340
I just hope her strength
can hold out long enough.

334
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,043
She's getting sicker
by the minute.

335
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,189
Why are you standing there?

336
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,090
Come on, inside...

337
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,859
It's cold out here.

338
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,393
Oh, no, that's really okay...

339
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,928
I want to stay out here.

340
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,697
Me, too.

341
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:30,736
[DALTON]
I see.

342
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,770
Huh?

343
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,378
Well, in that case,
I'll join you.

344
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,333
[DALTON] We did once have some
here on this island, you know.

345
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,501
Huh?

346
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,769
Some doctors...

347
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,239
However, all of them left some
time ago, for certain reasons...

348
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,743
They were very good at what they
did, while they were still here.

349
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,511
We were even well known
for the advanced medicine

350
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,346
that was practiced
on this island.

351
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,181
So what went wrong?

352
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,086
Few months ago...
we suffered a vicious attack,

353
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,157
and our country was destroyed...
destroyed by pirates...

354
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,858
Huh?

355
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,792
Oh man...

356
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,861
The whole country...?

357
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,429
[VIVI] So that's the
reason you acted that way

358
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,597
when we showed up?

359
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,333
[DALTON] Yes... After
the attack, the word "pirate"

360
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,202
still terrifies everyone
on this island.

361
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,338
I'm sorry about the
way we treated you...

362
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,776
Their group was small
as well‐‐only five people.

363
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,278
Their captain called
himself Blackbeard...

364
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,947
Their power was so
incredible, they destroyed

365
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,317
our entire country faster
than you would believe.

366
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,452
And there were only five
of them fighting...?

367
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,120
That's impossible!

368
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,855
Blackbeard?!

369
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:57,790
[DALTON]
What's more...

370
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,124
There are some here
who actually believe

371
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,459
that it was good
for the country.

372
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,861
What could possibly be
good about that happening...

373
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,829
That's crazy!

374
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,798
Who would say something
like that, anyway?!

375
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,835
[DALTON]
Thank you... I agree.

376
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,971
But they have their reasons.

377
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,040
The king who ruled here before
the attack was a horrible man.

378
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,544
His rule was despised
by all of the citizens.

379
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,546
Our country used to be
known as Drum Kingdom,

380
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,048
and our king's name was Wapol.

381
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,050
He was the worst
king imaginable.

382
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,819
[gasps]

383
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,491
Yes, I remember him...!
I know that man!

384
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,226
Not Wapol!

385
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,602
It feels like it's
gotten a little colder...

386
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,337
The wind's picking up, too.

387
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,539
So why don't you think about
putting on some real shoes?

388
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,608
Even seeing your
feet like that is painful.

389
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,610
[LUFFY]
No way. This is my police!

390
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,945
[SANJI]
Your "police"...?

391
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,179
I think you mean "policy."

392
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,248
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that's it.

393
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,950
So anyway, though...

394
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,917
Did you know this:

395
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,186
people in snow countries
never sleep at all.

396
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,554
Huh...? Why?

397
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,124
[LUFFY] Because if they do,
they'll freeze to death.

398
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,191
[SANJI]
Don't be an idiot.

399
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,027
Everyone has to sleep sometime.

400
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,694
[LUFFY]
It's the truth!

401
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,030
Someone told me a long time ago.

402
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,632
[SANJI]
Who, Usopp?

403
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,869
[LUFFY] No! I heard
it in a pub in my village.

404
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,138
[SANJI]
All right, then explain this:

405
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,373
What does that
Dalton guy have a bed for?

406
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,076
[LUFFY] Hmm.
I guess that's a good point.

407
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,114
[LUFFY] Hey!
Maybe it's for when he dies.

408
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,050
[SANJI]
That's ridiculous!

409
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,452
[SANJI]
Okay, then...

410
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,119
[LUFFY]
Huh?

411
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,387
[SANJI]
Did you know this:

412
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,390
Women in snowy countries have
skin that's as smooth as silk!

413
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,324
[LUFFY]
How come?

414
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,626
[SANJI]
Isn't it obvious...?

415
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,827
Here, I'll explain...

416
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,596
When you get cold, you rub
your skin to warm it up, right?

417
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,099
It's always freezing cold in
snowy countries like this one,

418
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,234
so the women keep rubbing
their skin all the time...

419
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,503
And so it becomes all white
and silky‐smooth.

420
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,173
[LUFFY] Okay... but then
how come it's white?

421
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,408
[SANJI]
Because... the snow...

422
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,243
It's constantly falling
all over them,

423
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,112
so it dyes their skin all white.

424
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,414
[LUFFY] Jeez... You're
really dumb. Did you know that?

425
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,949
[SANJI]
Yeah... Give me a break...!

426
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,484
Like you're really one to talk!

427
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,186
[roars]

428
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,922
You're becoming
a pain in my ass!

429
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,924
[LUFFY] Really, what
was with that thing?

430
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,462
[SANJI] Nami... Just hang
in there a little bit longer...

431
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,098
We're going to get you
to a doctor, all right?

432
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,636
[LUFFY] The snow's getting
really deep around here.

433
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,471
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy!

434
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,106
Try to run more
smoothly, will you?

435
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,274
You're just making
it harder on Nami.

436
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,612
[SANJI]
Huh?

437
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,615
[SANJI]
What are these things?

438
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,017
[LUFFY] Well, they're big
and they're white,

439
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,286
so they must be polar bears.

440
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,123
[DALTON]
What's that?

441
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,691
You mean you know who Wapol is?

442
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,725
[USOPP]
Know who he is...?

443
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,893
We know more than that!

444
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,296
He's the pirate who attacked
our ship not too long ago.

445
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,632
But... I was able
to take care of him...

446
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,201
Now that I think about it, I do
remember him saying something

447
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,203
about heading to Drum Kingdom.

448
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,072
[VIVI] Yes. There's
no question about it now.

449
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,306
I remember it clearly.

450
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,241
I'm sure I met him once

451
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,476
at a monarch meeting
my father took me to.

452
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,145
I was still very young then.

453
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,314
But I remember it to this day...

454
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,016
A monarch meeting?

455
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,650
Uh!

456
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,751
[DALTON]
Who are you?

457
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,688
Oh! No. I, uh... Well...

458
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,657
The point is we do know Wapol...

459
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,660
We ran into him yesterday
when we were on our way here.

460
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,594
Yesterday...?

461
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,596
Are you sure about that?

462
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,366
But then... I don't understand
what's going on here...

463
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,333
He said he was a pirate.

464
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,669
He didn't say anything
about being a king.

465
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,505
He's just calling himself a
pirate as some kind of disguise.

466
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,507
In truth, Wapol is only
wandering the seas,

467
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,277
trying desperately
to return to this island...

468
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,612
[VIVI] So then, Wapol and the
people who were on his ship

469
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,780
with him were
kicked off the island

470
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,283
because they were no match
for the pirates?

471
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,784
Is that what happened?

472
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,419
That's not it...

473
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,787
No...

474
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,521
[gasps]

475
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,056
[DALTON]
When it happened...

476
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:51,957
When we were attacked,

477
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,092
Wapol's army
didn't even try to fight.

478
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,460
[VIVI gasps]

479
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,528
[DALTON]
In fact,

480
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,864
the second he learned how
strong the pirates were

481
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,433
Wapol grabbed his cronies
and ran like a coward.

482
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,636
He was the first one to abandon
the country and flee out to sea.

483
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,873
After that, the country
felt utter despair.

484
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,209
We were left behind by our king.

485
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,544
What sort of king would
do that to his country?!

486
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,212
[USOPP]
Huh?

487
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,214
A king abandoning his people...!

488
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,151
Just the thought of that
makes me absolutely sick!

489
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,419
Vivi...

490
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,554
[DALTON]
You're exactly right.

491
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,223
The one good thing that
came out of it, though,

492
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,658
was the end of
Wapol's tyrannical rule...

493
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,894
The people who are left on this
island have come together now...

494
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,164
We're trying to create
a new country.

495
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
So what we fear most right now

496
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,435
is the return of Wapol
and his followers...

497
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,737
The return of his brutal rule...

498
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,405
We can't afford for him
to come back now

499
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,773
with the country so unstable...

500
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,642
It would be the end of us.

501
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,245
We want to build ourselves
a new, peaceful nation

502
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,746
on this island!

503
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,253
Look out!

504
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,160
Seriously. How can
it move like that?

505
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,195
Is it a gorilla?

506
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,830
[LUFFY]
No, it's a polar bear.

507
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,131
It's a rabbit!

508
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,300
How did you go
from gorilla to rabbit?

509
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,168
[SANJI] These must be
the Lapins that Dalton

510
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,536
was telling us about!

511
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,340
[SANJI] Well, there
sure are a lot of 'em!

512
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778
[CHESS]
Aaaaah!

513
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,714
Aaah...! Wapol, come quickly.

514
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,149
What is it now?!

515
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,218
Have you found
that pirate's ship yet?

516
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,453
No, that isn't it, Wapol...

517
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,555
At long last,
we've returned home!

518
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,523
We have?!

519
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,292
[CHESS] How many long
months have passed?

520
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,826
Wandering the sea...

521
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,896
That's our homeland...
It's Drum Kingdom!

522
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,199
[WAPOL] It truly is...

[SANJI] Listen, Luffy, I don't
want you fighting these guys.

Do you understand?

Why not?

She might die.

Just dodge.

Dodge and run,
but don't retreat.

What?
