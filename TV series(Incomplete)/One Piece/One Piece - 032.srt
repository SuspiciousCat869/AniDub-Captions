00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,390
in Cocoyashi village.

173
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,427
[USOPP growls]
So...

174
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,429
You're telling me that Nami
betrayed her mother,

175
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,964
her sister and her whole village

176
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,300
just to be a part
of Arlong's crew?

177
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,771
[NOJIKO] Yeah, pretty much.
A real witch, huh?

178
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,140
Damn. Nami is a total witch.

179
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,809
She had us completely
fooled the entire time.

180
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,779
To think she was just after
the treasure for herself.

181
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,949
Even after she risked her
life to save my village.

182
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,986
I don't understand.
She seemed so happy with us.

183
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,488
Yeah? She was happy?

184
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,358
Huh... My sister.

185
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,995
We came here to try to convince
her to come back with us,

186
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,331
but I guess now
that's pointless.

187
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:03,102
[gasping]

188
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,104
I just remembered that
a shipmate of mine

189
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,975
was taken prisoner by the
Fishmen before we got here.

190
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,011
Oh, I'm in trouble.
I hope he's okay.

191
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,879
I hope he's at least not dead.

192
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,386
[NAMI]
I guess you finally get it.

193
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,556
I just used you guys
to get what I wanted.

194
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,658
You were skilled enough
to serve my needs,

195
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,727
but boy, were you guys
a bunch of suckers.

196
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,665
[ARLONG laughs] She had you
guys completely fooled!

197
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,635
It's no use.
She's cold‐blooded.

198
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,737
She betrayed her
family for money,

199
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,873
so you really shouldn't
feel too bad.

200
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,409
If I were you, I would
just admit defeat

201
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,745
and try to forget
the day you met her.

202
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,247
[ZORO]
I don't need to.

203
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,017
Heh. Because I never saw
anything in her to be trusted

204
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,352
in the first place.

205
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,822
If she turned out to be a serial
killer, I wouldn't be surprised.

206
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,824
[NAMI] Fine! Then why don't you
just get the hell out of here.

207
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,559
I'm tired of your face.

208
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,560
[chuckles]

209
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,561
[gasps]

210
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,397
[ZORRO grunts]

211
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,331
[gasps]

212
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,265
[ARLONG]
Huh?

213
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,867
[ZORRO chuckles]

214
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,038
[FISHMEN gasp]

215
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,441
Hey... Anybody know why that
guy just jumped in the water?

216
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,010
It looks to me like he was just
trying to get away from Nami.

217
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:18,778
[FISHMAN E]
I don't blame him.

218
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,613
She can be really
mean sometimes.

219
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,081
[FISHMAN F]
Maybe he's trying to escape,

220
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,683
any of you geniuses
think of that?

221
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,618
[FISHMAN D] With his
arms and legs tied up?

222
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,586
I gotta say that looked
a lot more like a

223
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,355
suicide attempt to me.

224
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,623
Leave him.

225
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,460
[NAMI gasps]

226
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,114
[FISHMAN C] What an asshole.
Now I don't get to kill him.

227
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,982
[FISHMAN D] I thought he'd
have more self‐respect

228
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,050
than to do that!

229
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,119
[FISHMAN E] Seriously, life is
a precious thing.

230
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,556
[FISHMEN chuckle]

231
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,659
[NAMI]
That idiot!

232
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,835
[FISHMEN gasp, chatter]

233
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,571
[NAMI gasps]

234
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,271
[NAMI, ZORRO grunt]

235
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:19,972
[FISHMAN C]
They're back up!

236
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,640
[FISHMAN D]
She saved him.

237
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,645
[NAMI pants] What do
you think you're doing?

238
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:31,016
[ZORO coughs] No, what do
you think you're doing?

239
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,618
[NAMI gasps]

240
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:36,021
[ZORO coughs]
You're really just a nice girl

241
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,792
who can't watch one guy die.
Why don't you quit pretending?

242
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,793
[gasps]

243
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,861
[ZORO grunts]
And you might want to jump in

244
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,930
a little quicker next time.
I thought I was dead.

245
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,866
[NAMI grunts]
You bastard!

246
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,501
[ZORRO groans]

247
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,770
[NAMI] Try that again and
I'll make sure you die!

248
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,505
[ZORO chuckles]
Really?

249
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,106
[NAMI]
That's a lot of bandages.

250
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,108
You must have been
hurt pretty bad.

251
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,309
[ZORO]
Actually, I forgot my shirt.

252
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,479
Grabbed these to cover up so
you wouldn't get distracted.

253
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,850
[BOTH grunt]

254
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,057
Tell me... What should
we do with this guy?

255
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,058
[NAMI]
Lock him up.

256
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,161
I'll take care of him
when I have the time.

257
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,063
Arlong! Hey, Arlong!

258
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,066
Yeah? Well, spit it out.
What is it?

259
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,669
Yes sir... This guy
didn't come here alone.

260
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,070
There was another long nosed,

261
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,674
weird looking guy with
him but he got away.

262
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,142
[ZORO]
What the hell, Usopp?

263
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,912
You left me for dead
and got spotted anyway?

264
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,879
[FISHMAN A]
I think...

265
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,082
I think he escaped into
Cocoyashi Village.

266
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,019
Cocoyashi, uh?

267
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,823
That's perfect. Now I
have two reasons to go.

268
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,492
It's time to go have some fun.

269
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,069
[VILLAGER A]
Hey Arlong's coming!

270
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,605
[VILLAGER B]
He is? But why?

271
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,108
We just paid him this
month's tribute, didn't we?

272
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,178
[GENZO] It's probably about
my weapons cache they found.

273
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,780
Everyone go home.

274
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,716
[VILLAGER B gasps]
Genzo...

275
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,585
[VILLAGER C gasps]
They're here.

276
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,963
So you're the fool who thought
he could horde weapons

277
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,965
on my island.

278
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,634
[GENZO]
That's me. I'm a collector.

279
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,804
Is there a new law that forbids
us from having hobbies now,

280
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,638
as well?

281
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,706
[sighs]

282
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,574
Next, you'll be telling us
that we can't read books

283
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,543
or play with our
children anymore.

284
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,479
No, hobbies are fine.

285
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,982
It would be weapons
that I have forbidden.

286
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,252
They make it difficult for me
and my men to keep the peace.

287
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,319
[USOPP gasps]

288
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,991
That's him?! Arlong's gigantic!
He's not even human.

289
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,159
Nope... he's a Fishman.

290
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,327
[USOPP]
For real?!

291
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,830
[ARLONG] I'm responsible for
twenty towns and villages,

292
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,267
including this one, and as
your leader I cannot tolerate

293
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,602
even a little rebelliousness.

294
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:07,673
Wiping out Gosa was just a small
example of what can happen

295
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,676
when you do not do
as you are told.

296
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,113
Tribute money must be
paid no matter what.

297
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,148
What? Tribute money?

298
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,650
It's just what it sounds like.

299
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,085
Money we pay him so
we can stay alive.

300
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,620
Adults and children...

301
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,189
If there is even a single
person who can't pay...

302
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,025
...then what happened to Gosa...

303
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,628
...will happen to everyone
in this village as well.

304
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,966
Our town, and the people in it,
will be wiped from existence.

305
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,870
[USOPP] H‐He destroyed an entire
town because of one person?

306
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,705
[NOJIKO]
That's how Arlong rules.

307
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,674
To them we're nothing
but a sub‐species,

308
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,109
so killing us has
always been easy.

309
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,879
[ARLONG] You pathetic humans
need to stop with all this

310
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,216
"thinking" you're up to.
It's your greatest weakness.

311
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,219
I'm allowing you to contribute
to greatness here!

312
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,722
Soon Fishmen will
conquer the humans,

313
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,891
and your tributes will
be a small part

314
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,127
of the beginning of the
glorious Arlong Empire!

315
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,229
[gasps]

316
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,065
[USOPP]
Arlong Empire?!

317
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,301
[USOPP] They're planning
on taking over the entire

318
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,869
East Blue!

319
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,255
[thudding]

320
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,194
[footsteps]

321
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,264
Get outta here quick.
Arlong's gonna be back soon.

322
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,369
[ZORRO]
Hm.

323
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,004
[clattering]

324
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,340
[footsteps]

325
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,377
[GENZO groans]

326
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:55,914
Genzo!

327
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,049
[gasps]

328
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,284
[ARLONG] The possession
of weapons is a clear affront

329
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,452
to my authority.

330
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,056
As an example to any other
would‐be rebels in this town,

331
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,091
I'm going to kill you right now.

332
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,627
So they can see the fate
that awaits them!

333
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,231
[gasps]
No way! That guy is insane!

334
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,433
He'd kill someone for
just having a weapon!

335
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,434
I won't let him!

336
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,437
[USOPP gasps]
Hey, wait! Don't go out there!

337
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,774
[NOJIKO] You have absolutely
no right to do this Arlong!

338
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,809
[ARLONG]
Heh?

339
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,445
We've paid your tribute without
fail for over eight years.

340
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,814
Why would we rebel
against it now?

341
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:33,252
Just think about it.
It makes no sense!

342
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,387
Now take your hands off Genzo!

343
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,322
[VILLAGER A]
Yeah!

344
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,324
[VILLAGER F] It's not
like he used the weapons!

345
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,460
[VILLAGER C]
That's right! Let him go!

346
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,462
[VILLAGER D]
Yeah, let Genzo go!

347
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,164
[ARLONG]
Hording weapons shows he was

348
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,100
planning a rebellion against me.

349
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:52,404
But on the other hand...
I could destroy you all.

350
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,007
Please, try to protect your
friend so you won't give me

351
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,010
an excuse to do that.
Either way is fine,

352
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,779
but rebellions will
not be tolerated.

353
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,415
[GENZO grunts]
Everybody just go home.

354
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:07,019
Do you want to waste all of our
work over the past eight years?

355
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,855
For what? The time for
you to give your lives

356
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,791
for this village was back
when they first came.

357
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,194
Now we must continue
to be patient.

358
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,363
The most important thing is
that we continue to live!

359
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,866
We swore we would
not let them defeat us

360
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,434
as long as we're alive...

361
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,769
Genzo!

362
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,170
No...

363
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,207
Well said! I agree with you...

364
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,344
Heh ...it's good to know that
even disgusting insects like you

365
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,213
enjoy being alive!

366
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,514
[groans]

367
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,050
Oh, no!

368
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,352
There is no way any of
you will ever come close

369
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,221
to the perfection
of the Fishman.

370
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,156
[laughs]

371
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:44,890
Damn you!

372
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,191
Don't move!

373
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,293
He wants you to attack.

374
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,361
[GENZO grunts]

00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,230
We can't just stand here!

[gasps]

377
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,167
[GENZO]
Your deaths will mean nothing!

378
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,303
You must continue
to be patient...

379
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,873
[GENZO grunts]
...even if I die.

380
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,242
[ARLONG]
That's a good ending for you.

381
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,544
Pay close attention humans!

382
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,213
This is what happens
to those who defy me,

383
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,415
even if it is just
inside their tiny heads!

384

[GENZO groans]

386
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,823
Huh? What was that?

387
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,026
Huh? Up there! Look!

388
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,095
There's someone on the roof!

389
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,932
[FISHMAN C]
Who the hell is that guy?!

390
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:32,938
I am... the great warrior
of the sea, Captain Usopp!

391
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,274
Usopp...

392
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,876
Also known as the
Demon King Usopp,

393
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,445
feared and hated by
almost half the world!

394
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,283
I command thousands of men!
Loyal and vicious men!

395
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,118
That's the guy
I told you about!

396
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,120
The one with the long
nose that got away!

397
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,954
[USOPP yelps]

398
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,224
[ARLONG]
Bring on your thousands of men!

399
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,928
I'll crush them one by one.

400
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,129
[gasps]

401
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,199
[USOPP] The Exploding Star did
nothing and now he's pissed!

402
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,568
[ARLONG]
Repulsive human.

403
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:07,072
What can a creature
like you do to me!

Arlong, hold on just a second!

408
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,647
After losing Gosa,

409
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,617
we can't afford to kill off
any more tribute money!

410
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,319
[FISHMAN H]
Villages are fun to destroy,

411
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,055
but ruling over them
makes us more money!

412
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,093
[ARLONG] If we lose some,
we can always get more.

413
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,096
Fishmen must reign supreme!

414
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:31,997
[ALL gasp]

415
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,832

Usopp!

Am I... dead... yet?!

Aw, crap!

00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,343
[FISHMAN F]
Get him!

421
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,181
Catch him and tear him apart!

422
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,649
[FISHMAN K]
Let's go back to Arlong Park

423
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,851
before he destroys everything!

424
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,253
[Fishman J]
Yeah, I'm with you!

425
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,356
[ARLONG growls]
Don't let him get away!

426
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,358
Who does that
chumsucker think he is?

427
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,495
We'll be back.
You can all live for now.

00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,597
[GENZO grunts]

429
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,005
[GENZO] I'm so sorry everybody.
This has all been my fault.

430
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,375
What are you talking about?
You're not a Fishman are you?

431
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,175
[VILLAGER F]
Yeah!

432
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,677
But who was that
guy who attacked?

433
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,513
[panting]

434
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,215
[NAMI]
Hello everyone!

435
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,217
It's good to be back home.

436
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:25,884
[NOJIKO]
Nami?!

437
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:26,385
[VILLAGER B]
It's Nami!

438
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,053
[VILLAGER C]
You!

439
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,528
What's wrong?

440
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,665
You never just come walking
through Cocoyashi anymore.

441
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,635
I heard quite a commotion.
Arlong, huh?

442
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,916
[NAMI] I only have to get
seven million more berries.

443
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,520
Your already bad reputation
just keeps getting worse.

444
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,922
That's fine. I am a pirate.

445
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,591
Arlong can be a very reasonable
guy when he wants to.

446
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,661
I just need a little more money
to finish our agreement.

447
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,665
Just seven million berries
shy of the 100 million goal.

448
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,403
You know, it's really not that
high a price considering...

449
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,573
...that it's gonna buy
back our village! Heh!

450
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,211
[ZORO]
She tells me to run,

451
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,349
but I got nowhere
else to go but here.

452
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,719
Besides, I promised Luffy
I'd bring her back with me.

453
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,755
Man... what he's up to?

454
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,524
Cause things are getting
messy around here.

455
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,298

Yeah! Faster! Must go faster!
