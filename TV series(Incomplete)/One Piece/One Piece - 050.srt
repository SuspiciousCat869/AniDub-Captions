00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,653
Bluefin Tuna fish.

178
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,690
[chuckling]

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,395
Hey, look. This fish,
it's a weird one.

180
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,397
[COOK GG] What are you doing
with that cookbook, Sanji?

181
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,466
You studying different
kinds of fish?

182
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,469
[COOK HH] That one's the
Elephant Bluefin Tuna.

183
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,471
[SANJI]
You ever seen this fish?

184
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,840
Sometimes it's called
the gem of the ocean.

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,709
Some people even say
that it's a miracle food,

186
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,178
but nah, I've never seen it.

187
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,515
[COOK GG] Of course not.
That one's from the South Blue.

188
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,484
You'd never see it
in the East Blue,

189
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,520
unless you can
find the All Blue.

190
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,724
[COOK HH] Ha! The All Blue.
Now that would be impossible.

191
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,327
[COOK GG]
Heh. I know. I know.

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,529
Tell me about the All Blue!

193
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,197
[COOK HH]
It's a legendary sea

194
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,601
where all the fish of
the world swim together.

195
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,338
[COOK GG] Careful or he'll
believe every word you say.

196
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,739
Where is the All Blue?

197
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,342
[COOK GG] I told you.
Now he thinks it's real.

198
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,077
[COOK HH]
It's a joke, Sanji.

199
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,112
The All Blue doesn't
really exist.

200
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,382
[COOK GG] Forget about it.
Just keep studying.

201
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,260
The All Blue.

202
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,429
Okay, let's go. Lift it.

203
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,363
[FISHERMEN]
Right.

204
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,732
Hey, hold on a second.

205
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,635
How much for it?
Sell the fish to me!

206
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,569
What?

207
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,570
[SANJI]
I've got money.

208
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,206
Please let me buy that tuna!

209
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,711
I'm sorry, but I can't
sell this to ya.

210
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,214
This fish is gonna be the
grand prize for the contest.

211
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,383
It's... a prize?

212
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,318
[NESS]
That's right.

213
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,321
The annual cooking
contest happens today,

214
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,726
so cooks from all over the East
Blue will be here to compete,

215
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,929
and this fish is going to be the
Grand Prize for the winner.

216
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,299
It is an Elephant
Bluefin Tuna after all.

217
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,436
Any champion cook would be
honored to have it as a prize.

218
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,339
If you really want it, then
you should enter the contest.

219
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,941
You are a cook, aren't ya?

220
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,576
[SANJI]
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,745
Registration is
right over there.

222
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,781
You should give it a try if you
still want a shot at the tuna.

223
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,784
If I were you, I'd hurry
before it closes.

224
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,285
See ya.

225
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,825
A cooking contest. Yeah.

226
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,662
[SANJI]
Huh? Wait a second.

227
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,499
Now I challenge you, Sanj!

228
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,602
[SANJI]
Oh well...

229
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:18,297
[NESS] The annual Cooking
Festivities are about to start.

230
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,534
The greatest cooks from the East
Blue are here competing today.

231
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,537
It's so crowded.
I wonder what's going on.

232
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,842
[NESS] This year's grand prize
is an Elephant Bluefin Tuna.

233
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,212
It's the gem of the ocean
and a miracle food.

234
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,849
Who is going to win this
truly spectacular prize?

235
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,818
[CARMEN laughing]

236
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,353
[CARMEN]
That'll be me.

237
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,590
I'm so glad you decided
to show, Sanji.

238
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,427
But the title of "East Blue's
Number One" is going to be mine.

239
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,395
This'll be fun.

240
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,898
I've never had any real
competition before.

241
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,770
Oh, my Carmen.
It's so good to see you again.

242
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,238
My lips are so close.

243
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,373
[CARMEN]
Don't you dare!

244
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,011
Yeah! That's the fiery
passion I crave.

245
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,383
Hey. Look over there.
Sanji's here.

246
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:11,917
[USOPP]
Hm?

247
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,886
You're right.

248
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,887
[NAMI]
Of course.

249
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,857
[USOPP]
Hey! Over here!

250
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,358
[NAMI, USOPP]
Sanji! Hey!

251
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,362
[SANJI] Nami! You came
to watch me compete!

252
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,731
Heck no.
I was just walking by.

253
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,901
So what made you wanna compete
in a cooking contest, Sanji?

254
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,870
Usopp, when'd you get here?

255
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,472
I'm the one who yelled
out your name first, jerk!

256
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,709
Who's ready to
start the cooking?

257
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,044
Just for fun we picked one
of you out of the crowd

258
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,913
to join our panel of judges.

259
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,649
Say hello to Sam, who was
just on his way home

260
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,819
to sleep off the rest of his
daughter's wedding reception.

261
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,387
You ready, Sam?

262
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,989
Yeah!

263
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,790
[NESS]
The rules are very simple.

264
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,293
Each cook competes
in a blind draw,

265
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,562
head‐to‐head elimination round

266
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,831
where the highest
total score wins.

267
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,734
Whoever ends up undefeated
though all the rounds

268
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,737
will be the new
East Blue Champion!

269
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,640
First up, from the easternmost
part of the East Blue...

270
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,608
...Shoo the Lizard!

271
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,946
Facing him, representing our
very own Loguetown, Broccoli.

272
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,483
Ready? Let's go!

273
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,751
What's up, Sanji?

274
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:22,021
You really wanna be known as
the best cook in the East Blue?

275
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,623
No. Don't be stupid.

276
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,426
I'm just after one thing
and that's the fish.

277
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,627
A fish?

278
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,030
Yeah, that looks
like a nice fish.

279
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,332
It sure does,
but the confusing part

280
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,469
is trying to figure out exactly
how I can get that fish to talk.

281
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,003
Now, it's the final round!

282
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,838
[CROWD cheering]

283
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,841
Oh wow. These people
are really excited.

284
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,009
Your right.

285
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,978
[NESS] With his instinctive
skills and sense for food,

286
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,547
we have in the finals, Sanji!

287
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,382
Facing him with her
gorgeous presentation

288
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,085
and culinary acumen, Carmen!

289
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,923
Who will be the winner of the
glorious Elephant Bluefin Tuna?

290
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,858
Start your cooking.

291
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,532
Time to rinse.

292
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,502
[laughing]

293
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,537
[NESS] Carmen's cooking with
outstanding showmanship

294
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,040
while doing things which
are relatively simple.

295
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,575
Meanwhile her two cheerleaders

296
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,711
are trying to distract
her opponent.

297
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,114
And how is Sanji doing?

298
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,453
He is rockin'.
Knife blades flying.

299
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,191
[NESS] And it looks like
Sanji's whipping up

300
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:09,128
a creation of
delectable delight.

301
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,206
[SANJI]
I know it's for real.

302
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,945
[COOK GG] You don't really
believe that do you? It's silly.

303
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,148
[COOK HH] What would a kid
like you know anyway?

304
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,051
I know a lot more than
you do, you bastard.

305
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,919
That'll be enough, Sanji.

306
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,454
Can't you see we're
busy cooking?

307
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,589
We don't have time for
these silly games.

308
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,759
Why don't you go
set out the plates?

309
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,261
[SANJI]
I know that theoretically

310
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,497
this is an impossibility.

311
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,501
The North Blue, South Blue,
East Blue, and West Blue,

312
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,737
they're separate seas that
shouldn't be able to mix

313
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,072
because of the Red
Line Continent

314
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,173
running from north to south

315
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,945
and the Grand Line ocean
current running west to east.

316
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,613
A place where you can find fish

317
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,284
from all four seas
should be impossible.

318
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,787
[SANJI] But I know it exists.
It has too!

319
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,788
[SANJI]
That's right.

320
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,124
Otherwise how do you explain
the West Blue fish

321
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,961
and the Elephant Bluefin Tuna?

322
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,499
That old geezer might not've
been just telling stories.

323
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,101
I don't have a choice.

324
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,937
I have to look for it
in the Grand Line.

325
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,175
[SANJI] I don't care how long
it takes. I will find it.

326
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,011
[SANJI]
The legendary sea.

327
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,147
[BOTH]
The All Blue!

328
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,857
Sanji is moving on to
his final preparations.

329
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,959
Carmen is finishing up as well.

330
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,328
She just has to plate
up her creation!

331
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,331
This is it folks, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

332
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,667
Who will win the
Elephant Bluefin Tuna?

333
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,171
The decision is
only moments away.

334
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,240
[NESS]
He did it.

335
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,877
Sanji's masterpiece is finished.

336
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,680
And here comes Carmen
with her final touches.

337
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,017
[NESS]
The contestants are done,

338
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,088
so now it's all in the
hands of the judges.

339
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,329
Well then, here goes.

340
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,667
The winner of this year's
cooking championship is...

341
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,269
‐‐...San‐‐
‐‐[CARMEN] Wait!

342
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,503
[ALL gasp]

343
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,183
[CARMEN]
I can't forgive myself.

344
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,286
I can't believe I thought
I could beat you.

345
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,521
I watched you cook
when you were young.

346
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,390
You were driven even back then.

347
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,059
They wouldn't let me in
the kitchen like you,

348
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:59,231
and it made me so resentful.

349
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,367
I've trained so hard
for so many years...

350
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,537
That's why I wanted to find you
and show you what I'd learned.

351
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,740
But after all this time,
you've only gotten better...

352
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:12,044
I don't know what made me
think I could beat you.

353
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:18,383
The truth is... You beat
me fair and square.

354
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:23,055
You are the number one
cook in the East Blue.

355
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,594
Carmen!

356
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,064
That's the best compliment
anyone's ever given me.

357
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,466
‐‐I'm so happy I could‐‐!
‐‐[LEO] Don't you dare!

358
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,771
Why'd you do that?!

359
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,409
I'm forfeiting this round,

360
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,745
but be ready for the
next time we meet.

361
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,747
I won't lose to you again.

362
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,283
Well, if it's a challenge
from you, Carmen,

363
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,585
I'll definitely accept.

364
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,621
[USOPP, NAMI chuckle]

365
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,625
[NESS]
And the winner is... Sanji!

366
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:03,695
[NAMI]
Yeah! Way to go, Sanji!

367
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,431
We need you could do it!

368
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,135
Wow, that was fun.

369
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,104
I don't know why but I
just love competitions!

370
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,107
How did I get stuck carrying
the heavy end of this thing?

371
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,144
[SANJI] Wow, an actual
Elephant Bluefin Tuna.

372
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,846
I wonder what it tastes like.

373
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,348
I'm gonna use the fins
for stock I know that,

374
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,351
but what am I gonna
do with the ears?

375
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,654
I just can't wait to cook it.

376
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,721
[NAMI]
Huh?

377
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,558
Huh? What's up, Nami?

378
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,294
It's... the air.

379
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,628
The air?

380
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,796
[NAMI]
It's going to rain.

381
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,798
[USOPP]
But it's so nice.

382
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
I'm sure of it. Let's hurry.

383
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,236
Huh? Wait!

384
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,210
[LUFFY]
My hat!

385
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,146
Wait!

386
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,750
[LUFFY]
Stop hat!

387
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,754
Uhh... Luffy?

388
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,197
[LUFFY]
Good! My hat.

389
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,337
[LUFFY]
Ah. I found it.

390
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,708
Here goes!

391
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,710
[CABAJI]
We found him. This way.

392
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,511
Are you sure about that?

393
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,612
He's there now?

394
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,715
Yes, we were watching the
square as you had ordered

395
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,850
and he just showed up
out of nowhere.

396
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,518
[SMOKER]
Perfect.

397
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,754
[BUGGY]
Let's go flashily.

398
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,758
[SMOKER]
So he finally showed up.

399
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,194
It took him long enough.

400
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,801
[LUFFY]
Woohoo!

401
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,905
So this is what the King of
the Pirates saw when he died.

402
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,584

403

423
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,690
[USOPP] What?!
Luffy's gonna be executed?!

424
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:19,458
[NAMI]
No way!

425
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,359
[ZORO]
By Buggy?! What a shame!

426
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,994
[SANJI] So all we have
to do is beat them?

427
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,229
[LUFFY]
Yep! Help me!

428
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,865
[ZORO] Okay, then! We'll bring
down the execution platform!

429
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,966
[SANJI]
Lets do it.

430
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,904
[LUFFY] Zoro, Sanji, Usopp,
Nami! Sorry! I'm dead.

431
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,806
On the next One Piece!

432
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,807
"Buggy's Revenge.

433
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,344
The Man Who Smiles On
the Execution Platform."

434
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,847
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
