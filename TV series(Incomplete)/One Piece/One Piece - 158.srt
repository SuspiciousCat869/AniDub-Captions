1
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:43,408
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:48,788
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:53,293
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,963
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:01,885
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:05,055
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,432
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,978
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,939
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,233
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:25,533
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,036
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,663
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:35,669
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,088
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,715
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,639
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:50,100
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,395
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,647
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,732
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,777
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,279
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:07,992
<i>Through the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

26
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,787
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,081
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

28
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:18,169
<i>See the light I have</i>
<i>searched for everywhere!</i>

29
00:02:23,258 --> 00:02:24,592
[NARRATOR]
Luffy and his crew have managed

30
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,594
to avoid the White
Beret's demands,

31
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,638
but Eneru's Super
Express Lobster

32
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,098
dragged away the Going Merry

33
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,601
with Nami, Zoro, Robin
and Chopper aboard.

34
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:38,356
So you're saying, if we want
our friends and ship back,

35
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,233
we have to walk right up
to their front door

36
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,651
and march on it.

37
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:44,237
This is part of the
challenge you mention?

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,197
Part of Heaven's Judgment?

39
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,449
Yes.

40
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,325
In Upper Yard, there are
four powerful Priests

41
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,328
of unimaginable strength
who await you.

42
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:56,124
[LUFFY] Hmm. Sounds
like a piece of cake.

43
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,752
I mean, all we have to do
to get our friends back

44
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,962
is beat up these priests, right?

45
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,589
You make it sound easy.

46
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:06,426
[laughing]

47
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:08,970
Finally! A little action.

48
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,813
[LUFFY] "A Trap on Lovely
Street! The Almighty Eneru!"

49
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,034
[USOPP]
Hey! Luffy!

50
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,702
[SANJI]
Wait up a minute, will ya?

51
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:34,496
[LUFFY]
Yeah? What is it?

52
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,747
[SANJI]
What's the big idea?

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,791
Why'd you just up and
leave all of a sudden?

54
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,376
You heard Nami.

55
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,587
If we stay we'll just cause more
trouble for Conis and her dad.

56
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,798
[SANJI] All right, so where
are we goin' then?

57
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:48,134
Where do you think?
The sacrificial altar.

58
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:50,970
[SANJI] And how are you
planning to get there?

59
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:54,307
[LUFFY]
Hm.

60
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:57,477
[SANJI]
You have to think about it?!

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,728
There you go.

62
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,188
We can just swipe one of
those boats out there

63
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:01,398
and head up the Milky Road.

64
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,315
Easy.

65
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,109
[SANJI]
Easy, huh?

66
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,194
Do you see any boats out there?

67
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:07,320
[LUFFY]
Um.

68
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:08,822
[SANJI]
Oh, just stop trying to think!

69
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:11,157
A boat wouldn't do us
much good, anyway.

70
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,118
Not if all we have to
go on is this old map.

71
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,578
I can't even tell where
we are on this thing.

72
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:18,540
And look, the Milky Road
isn't even on here at all.

73
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:21,084
Man, what a pain in the butt.

74
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,379
[SANJI]
Uh. Hm?

75
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,632
[CONIS]
Excuse me.

76
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:29,342
[SANJI]
Conis, sweetheart!

77
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:32,762
You came all this way to give
me a goodbye kiss, huh?

78
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,056
Well, actually, I'm here
because of my father.

79
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,599
He asked me to help
you find your way

80
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:38,518
to the sacrificial altar.

81
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,437
Aw! That's sweet!

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,398
[CONIS] I can accompany you as
far as the Angel Island docks.

83
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,401
We should be able to find
you a suitable boat there.

84
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,278
You got a definite plan.

85
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,739
Unlike a certain little
scatterbrain I know.

86
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:51,823
Yeah, right?

87
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,324
I meant you!

88
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:56,036
[SANJI] You're gonna be
our escort, Conis? Great!

89
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:59,330
We'd be delighted to
have you. Right, Luffy?

90
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:06,296
Of course we would!
Lead on, lady!

91
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,714
[CONIS]
Great!

92
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,221
[chuckles]

93
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:17,182
There's no way
I'll let you escape.

94
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,601
I'm going to send all
of you to Upper Yard

95
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,187
to receive Heaven's Judgment.

96
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,775
[SUU]
Suu-suu.

97
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,405
[LUFFY]
What's that?

98
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,032
[CONIS]
Oh, that's Lovely Street.

99
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,034
If you want a closer look,
you're in luck.

100
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:39,037
We actually have to pass
through it to reach the docks.

101
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:51,257
[MEMBER A] Captain, aren't they
already headed for Upper Yard?

102
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:53,009
[MEMBER B] Yeah, what're
we sneakin' around for?

103
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,552
[MCKINLEY]
Idiots!

104
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,222
You both know how these
Blue Sea people are.

105
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:58,640
They're all the same.

106
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:01,017
Oh, sure, they talk about
excitement and adventure,

107
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,602
but when they actually
face danger,

108
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,605
they cry and run
for their lives.

109
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,942
Exciting, huh?
Upper Yard here we come!

110
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:12,153
You realize there's a chance
you'll all be killed up there.

111
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:15,115
Well, everyone's
gotta go sometime.

112
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,741
So you're not worried at all?

113
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:19,953
Are you serious?
Why would I be worried?

114
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:27,252
[SANJI, USOPP shouting]

115
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,673
'Kay, I'm sorry.

116
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,058
[LUFFY]
Wow! This place is great!

117
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,060
[CONIS] Lovely Street is
the center of commerce

118
00:06:44,144 --> 00:06:45,020
on the Island.

119
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:45,687
It has everything.

120
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,814
[LUFFY laughs]

121
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:50,817
Check it out! Floating stores!

122
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,861
[CONIS] It takes a special
variety of island cloud

123
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,195
to build those.

124
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,615
[LUFFY] So where's all the
floating restaurants?

125
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,003
[ISLANDER I]
It's them.

126
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:19,095
[ISLANDERS murmuring]

127
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:23,933
Hey, guys. I notice everyone's
avoiding us. Again.

128
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:25,435
[SANJI]
Can't say I blame 'em.

129
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,812
Word's probably already gotten
out that we're criminals.

130
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,773
So what else is new?

131
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,149
[LUFFY laughs]

132
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,109
[LUFFY]
Ah, let 'em be that way!

133
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:36,696
That means we've got
downtown all to ourselves!

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,908
All these gorgeous angels
and they're avoiding me.

135
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,671
[chuckles]

136
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,507
[LUFFY]
Huh.

137
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,051
Sure is a lot of weird
stuff for sale here.

138
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:00,720
[gasps]

139
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:03,306
[LUFFY] Aw, man. Too bad
I don't have any money.

140
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,475
Hey, mister, do you
take treasure?

141
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,026
[screaming]

142
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,741
[LUFFY]
Ooh!

143
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:24,077
This must be a Dial shop!

144
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,122
Wow, these Breath
Dials are huge!

145
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,873
I should put a couple
on the Going Merry--

146
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,667
we'd be as fast as a waver!

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,377
[LUFFY chuckles]

148
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:38,425
[screaming]

149
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,260
Hey, Luffy, when you're
done foolin' around,

150
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:42,387
there's still the matter of
rescuing Nami and the others.

151
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,222
If you don't get
serious, and soon,

152
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,349
they're gonna be sacrificed,
do you know that?

153
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:48,601
[LUFFY] You worry too much!
They're fine!

154
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:50,520
Don't forget, Zoro's with them!

155
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,564
Yeah, like we can really
count on that guy!

156
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,858
I just hope the ship hasn't
sustained any more damage.

157
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:57,902
I mean, she's had more than
her share of abuse lately.

158
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,613
[LUFFY] Huh. There's something
in the middle of the street!

159
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:01,740
[CONIS]
Huh?

160
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:08,163
[LUFFY]
What a weird face!

161
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,040
What's it supposed
to be? A seal?

162
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,875
[SANJI] Looks like a figure
made outta mud.

163
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,419
Knowing this place, I bet it's
some kinda religious statue.

164
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,004
[USOPP]
Oh, you're both morons.

165
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,881
This is art! I can tell!

166
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,549
[CONIS]
This is "vearth."

167
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,259
You might say it represents

168
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:24,137
the eternal yearnings of
the people of the sky.

169
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,138
Vearth, huh?

170
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,389
Really?

171
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:29,184
So what, you guys like,
pray to this thing?

172
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,019
That's pretty crazy.

173
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,313
[CONIS giggles]

174
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,899
[CONIS] Well, I guess it would
be difficult for someone

175
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,776
from the Blue Sea to understand.

176
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,195
Oh! We're almost to
the docks! Right this way!

177
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,072
Aw! We're leavin' town already?

178
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,156
[USOPP]
Already?

179
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,574
We were never planning
on stopping here

180
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:45,825
in the first place!

181
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,285
[LUFFY]
I know, but I don't see why

182
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,788
we couldn't stick around
a little bit longer.

183
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,585
[ISLANDER L]
Phew! Looks like it worked.

184
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,337
[ISLANDER M] Yeah, they're
headed straight for the docks.

185
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,797
[ISLANDER N]
We're saved!

186
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:09,641
[chuckles]

187
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,443
[LUFFY]
Look at all these boats!

188
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,736
Yes, you'll notice
there are boats

189
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,739
of all shapes and sizes
anchored in this harbor.

190
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,951
From luxurious hotel ships
where you can spend the night

191
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,245
to sleeker models that
are made for speed

192
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:33,206
and loaded up with giant dials.

193
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,959
If you look over here,
there are even more types.

194
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:36,918
Whoa!

195
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,587
That one! It's perfect!

196
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:45,427
[LUFFY] I always wanted a
gondola! We'll take it!

197
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,970
Ooh! Look back there!

198
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:49,681
I bet those dials make this baby
move quicker than lightning!

199
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,349
This is gonna be
a whole lotta fun!

200
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,059
Come on! Let's go for a spin!

201
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:54,310
[SANJI]
You idiot.

202
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,771
We've got to rescue the
crew first, remember?

203
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,106
Get serious, will ya?

204
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,275
[CONIS] Actually, your boat
is right over here.

205
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:00,859
[SANJI]
Great!

206
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,736
[LUFFY]
Ooh! Ha!

207
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,612
Is it even awesomer
than the gondola?

208
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:06,865
Oh, man, I can't wait to see it.

209
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,002
Presenting: The Crow!

210
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,256
Ah! You're kidding me, right?

211
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,303
[SANJI]
Wait, uh, crows don't even swim.

212
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,680
[CONIS] I only learned
to ride a waver recently.

213
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,849
Before then, I used the
Crow to get around.

214
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:34,809
It's not as fast as
a waver of course,

215
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:38,146
but it has two Breath Dials,
and is quite reliable.

216
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:40,565
Please, feel free to use it.

217
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,651
Wait. I'm not going.

218
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:44,861
[gasps]

219
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:06,841
Wait. I'm not going.

220
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:08,134
[gasps]

221
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:12,263
[MCKINLEY]
Aha!

222
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,182
I knew he'd finally
show his true colors.

223
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:17,227
No one in their right mind
doesn't value their own life!

224
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,311
Oh!

225
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,523
Unless I can take that.

226
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,654
He's not scared; he's selfish.

227
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,617
That one, huh?
You don't like the Crow?

228
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,119
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,912
The only thing sorry is this
guy! Apologize, you ingrate!

230
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,622
She goes to the trouble
of getting us a boat

231
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:38,832
and all you do is complain!

232
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,375
What's wrong with you?

233
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,961
I'm sorry he doesn't appreciate
your help like I do, Conis.

234
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,879
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,297
[CONIS]
It's okay.

236
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,394
[USOPP]
Hm?

237
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:05,775
[CONIS]
Your exit is Gate Number Two.

238
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,485
It leads right to
the Milky Road,

239
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,072
and that will take you all
the way to Upper Yard.

240
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:14,325
Just... Just follow it
and you'll be fine.

241
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,372
[LUFFY]
Hey, Conis.

242
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:20,582
Yes?

243
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,709
You've been trembling
ever since we left.

244
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,586
Is everything okay?

245
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,341
Ugh. Can't hear.

246
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,468
What're they talkin' about?

247
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:35,055
[CONIS]
I-Is it that noticeable?

248
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:39,684
Yeah. It's like you're
scared or something.

249
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:44,981
No, wait. She wouldn't!

250
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,149
[SANJI laughs]

251
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:47,817
Don't you get it?
She's worried about us!

252
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:51,821
Oh, Conis, that is so
sweet of you, my dear!

253
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,658
[USOPP]
Speaking of being worried,

254
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,994
are you and Pagaya
gonna be all right?

255
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,455
I mean, everyone in town
is avoiding us like the plague,

256
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:02,665
but you're leading us around,
lending us your boat,

257
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,376
giving us directions.

258
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,253
Is helping us gonna
get you in trouble?

259
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:11,299
Doesn't that make you,
like, our accomplices?

260
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,220
Conis, don't cry.
You'll gonna be fine, 'kay?

261
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,223
You should've told us
you were scared.

262
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:21,226
Really. We could have just
come here on our own.

263
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:22,769
No, it's--

264
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,354
It's not--

265
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,366
[CONIS]
It's not what you think!

266
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,454
She wouldn't dare.

267
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:44,833
Don't say anything
you'll regret.

268
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,085
Don't you get it?

269
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,671
Even after I told you how
terrifying Upper Yard is,

270
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,297
I still led you here.

271
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,925
I even got you a boat and
told you which route to take.

272
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,385
Don't you find that odd?

273
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:58,013
Isn't it obvious
what's going on here?

274
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,681
[growls]

275
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:03,643
Watch your tongue, little girl!
Don't say anything foolish!

276
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:05,854
[USOPP]
Huh? You hear somethin'?

277
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:13,570
[USOPP]
Huh?

278
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:19,451
[SANJI] Don't tell me
they're all in on this.

279
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,881
[CONIS]
But why? We shouldn't do this.

280
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,674
They're not like the others.

281
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,843
Besides, there's no need
for me to guide them.

282
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,095
They're already headed
for Upper Yard.

283
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,431
Conis, if that were truly so,

284
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,725
I would not have to burden
you with this task.

285
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:45,602
But we must face facts.

286
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:47,562
You've seen how other
Blue Sea dwellers act

287
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:50,899
when they come here, these three
are probably no different.

288
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,360
Once the initial
excitement wears off,

289
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:55,695
the reality of what
they're facing sets in.

290
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:58,156
They get scared and begin
to value their lives

291
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,533
over their dreams of adventure.

292
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:03,578
That's why we must lead them
to the Milky Road's end.

293
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:06,122
All the way to Upper Yard.

294
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:12,212
[PAGAYA]
Oh, Conis, please forgive me.

295
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:14,464
But it's every citizen's duty.

296
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:15,632
You know what will happen

297
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,760
if we don't follow
almighty Eneru's will.

298
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:24,599
[SANJI, USOPP gasp]

299
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,187
[CONIS]
Just run away. Please.

300
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,026
I'm so sorry, you guys!

301
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,489
No, no, stop!

302
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,491
What do you think you're doing?!

303
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:44,035
I called the Super
Express Lobster.

304
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,871
It was all my fault!

305
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:49,499
You mean that thing that took
Nami and the others away?

306
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,584
You called it, Conis?

307
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:57,382
[CONIS] While you three were
inside talking to my father,

308
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,801
I went aboard and lied to
your friends about a current

309
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,636
that leads to Cloud End.

310
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,015
They believed me.
And I had them raise anchor.

311
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,230
[CONIS] That was the signal that
summoned almighty Eneru's

312
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:14,399
Super Express Lobster.

313
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,577
[MCKINLEY]
What? Do you want to die?

314
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,454
You stupid girl!

315
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:28,830
[CONIS] Once we know
someone's a criminal,

316
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,790
we must lead them to Upper Yard!

317
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:34,210
If we don't, then
the penalty is death!

318
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:37,505
[ISLANDER S]
You idiot!

319
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,091
You're gonna bring his
wrath down upon us all!

320
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,051
[ISLANDER R]
This is outrageous!

321
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,053
[ISLANDER Q]
Somebody stop her!

322
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:46,181
[CONIS] It's our duty.
The duty of every citizen.

323
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,599
That's crazy!

324
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,225
[CONIS]
I know!

325
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,897
I-I'm sorry. I should've
told you sooner.

326
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,273
Wait a sec.

327
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:59,319
You're saying they forced
you to lead us all here?

328
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,782
If that's true...

329
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,995
[ALL] ...then why even
tell us at all?!

330
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,295
[LUFFY] Are you nuts?
Now your life is in danger!

331
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,630
[ISLANDER M]
It's all over!

332
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,006
[ISLANDER N]
We're too late!

333
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,299
[ISLANDER S]
Get away from the girl!

334
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,593
[ISLANDER J]
The judgment is coming!

335
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,792
[yelling]

336
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,215
It's too big!

337
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,794
[USOPP coughing]

338
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:48,803
[gasps] What in the
world was that thing?

339
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,181
It did that?

340
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,098
[USOPP]
Luffy!

341
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,059
[SANJI]
Conis! Where are you?

342
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,643
Conis!

343
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,104
Luffy! Conis!

344
00:19:58,188 --> 00:19:59,272
Hah!

345
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,273
[ISLANDER W]
That's what happens to those

346
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,942
who defy almighty Eneru!

347
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,991
[GAN FALL] Do not fear.
They are both safe.

348
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:15,121
[PIERRE]
Pi-e!

349
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,748
It's him! Gan Fall!

350
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:17,874
[gasps]

351
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,002
Oh! The weird old man!

352
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,296
Me, "weird"? No.

353
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,300
I am the Sky Knight, friend.
And this one's on the house.

354
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,224
Conis! Look she's safe!

355
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,559
[GAN FALL] And she will
remain so under my watch.

356
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:40,897
You have my word. I shant
allow Eneru to harm her.

357
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,440
Thanks!

358
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:47,404
Now that you've seen the scope
of Eneru's power and anger,

359
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,614
what are you going to do next?

360
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,951
The same thing we were
gonna do from the start.

361
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,162
Go to Upper Yard and
rescue our friends.

362
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:59,457
I see. May luck be with you.

363
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,210
[PIERRE]
Pi-e!

364
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,468
[CONIS]
What about them?

365
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,554
[GAN FALL] They have chosen
their own course.

366
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:15,807
Do not blame yourself, child.

367
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,477
I-I know who you really are.

368
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:21,688
[GAN FALL]
Of course! It's no secret.

369
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:22,856
I am the Sky Knight.

370
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,900
No. We-We all know.

371
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,696
Please come back to us... God.

372
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,286
[USOPP]
Good luck, fellas!

373
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,122
Hop aboard. Get comfy.
I'll give you good shove off!

374
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,248
[SANJI]
Get on the boat!

375
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,083
[USOPP]
I don't wanna!

376
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,090
All right, Upper Yard,
here we come!

377
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,426
[USOPP crying]

378
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,595
[USOPP]
No!

379
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,850
They-They went.

380
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,895
Without any fear or hesitation!

381
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,912
[LUFFY laughing]

382
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:38,932
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

383
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

384
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,316
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

385
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

386
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,948
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

387
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

388
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,915
<i>We will never yield</i>

389
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>We won't back down</i>

390
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,087
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

391
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,593
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

392
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,055
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

393
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,475
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

394
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:30,358
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

395
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,247
[USOPP]
Will Conis be all right?

396
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,041
[SANJI] All we can do
is count on the old man!

397
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,126
We gotta save Nami
and Robin right now!

398
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,419
[USOPP]
And the other two!

399
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:50,837
[LUFFY]
Hey! What's that?

400
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,380
--[SANJI] Is this it?
--[USOPP screaming]

401
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,591
--Heaven's Judgment?
--[USOPP screaming]

402
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:55,592
--Shut up!
--[USOPP screaming]

403
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,427
[LUFFY]
Just keep moving forward!

404
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,471
[USOPP]
Oh, I just wanna go home!

405
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,264
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

406
00:24:01,348 --> 00:24:04,309
"Onward, Crow!
To the Sacrificial Altar!"

407
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,853
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
