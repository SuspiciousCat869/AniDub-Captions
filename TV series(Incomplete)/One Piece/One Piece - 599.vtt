00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.061
[gasps]
Run!

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.481
[BROOK screams]

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.484
[ALL shout]

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.777
[ALL]
Huh?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.742
[ALL screaming]

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.495
Is it able to produce
unlimited copies of itself?

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.997
Actually, I don't think
it's unlimited.

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:12.082
The one on that
side is shrinking!

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.001
If that's the case, then the
other one should run out

00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:16.170
of mass soon,
but what's the point?

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.048
[gasps] Wait, maybe it's trying
to fling itself over here

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.341
in pieces!

00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:27.598
We can't have it running
wild on this side!

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.350
People are gonna get hurt!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.935
Yeah, it spews gas
when you cut it,

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.269
and blows up when you burn it,

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.814
plus it's way bigger than
the ones from before!

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.026
The lab's in danger.
Let's hurry!

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:42.863
Right! Time is of the essence!
Momonosuke!

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.073
I'm gonna head to the lab.

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:46.033
What do the rest
of you plan to do?

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.743
Obviously we're going
to the lab too,

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:49.411
since we have to
stick together, stupid!

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:50.871
Who're you calling stupid?

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:51.997
Think about it, Mosshead!

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.250
If you wander off and get
separated from Kin'emon,

00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:56.544
we're just gonna have to run all
over the island looking for you!

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:57.878
We don't have time for that!

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.547
[BROOK]
There's no time for this!

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:00.923
Please stop arguing!

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:02.216
[ZORO]
It's his--

--[whistling]

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.719
[yelps]

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:08.806
I can't wait to see a real
whole samurai in action!

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.392
To the laboratory, everyone!

00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:13.185
[whistling]

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.482
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.900
You're awake.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.443
[LUFFY]
Why are you here?

00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:23.988
[LAW]
I could ask you the same thing.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.281
[ROBIN]
How about that?

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:27.491
It would seem we've
all been captured.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:31.412
Huh? We're all in a cage?
That's weird, huh?

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:32.121
[SMOKER (TASHIGI) grunts]

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:34.290
Oh! Smokey, you're in here too!

00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:38.335
[TASHIGI (SMOKER) grunts]

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:41.589
No use. We're tied up with
Sea Prism Stone chains.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.843
[MONET chuckles]
I see you're awake.

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.803
Is she... a bird?

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.601
[VERGO] Aren't you a
sight for sore eyes.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.020
[gasps]
Why's he here?

00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:00.608
Well I'll be damned. If it isn't
the leader of the G -5 himself.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.151
Vergo!

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:22.463
[MARINE L]
Let Smokey go, Caesar!

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:23.339
[gunshot]

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.215
[MARINE M]
And Captain Tashigi, too!

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:25.925
[gunshots]

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:30.971
[MARINES shouting]

00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:37.102
[CENTAUR A grunts]
Okay! All clear!

00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:39.396
[CENTAUR B]
Good, close the shutters!

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:44.109
Whatever you do, boys, don't let
a single one of them in!

00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:47.613
Activate it the second
all of our men are inside!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.664
[MARINES gasp]

00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:00.626
[MARINE G]
What?

00:16:08.258 --> 00:16:09.760
[MARINE N]
They shut the gate!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.470
They can't just
leave us out here!

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:15.766
[MARINES shouting]

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.768
[MARINES gasp]

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:25.526
It's closed. We were too late!

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:28.779
Open the door! Hurry!

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.656
Let me handle this!

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.327
[MARINE A gasps]

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.669
[MARINE O] Damn! Even a bazooka
won't break through it?

00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.546
[MARINE P]
What's that thing made of?

00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:47.548
[MARINE Q]
How 'bout the back?

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:50.968
There's no way in! I checked.
He's got it locked down tight!

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.637
Of course he does,
the gas bag!

00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:56.056
Hey, uh. If we're
stuck out here,

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.392
then we're all gonna
be killed, for sure.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:00.894
Huh? Don't say that!
We'll make it!

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.480
[MARINE S] I don't think so!
Those creepy Slime things

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.066
may have stopped
falling from the sky...

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:07.317
...but look!

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:10.320
They're forming together and
getting really 'freakin' huge!

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.947
[MARINES gasp]

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:18.662
[MARINE R] We can't get to a
ship, our path's been cut off!

00:17:18.662 --> 00:17:20.581
They took our
Transponder Snails.

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:21.665
We can't call out!

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.418
Crap, they've got us
completely isolated!

00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:30.424
[CENTAUR B]
Alright. They're all shut!

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:32.259
[MONET]
Good.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:33.719
Cu-lick.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.764
[MONET] It sounds like the
preparations are underway.

00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:39.600
Too bad for all
those Navy soldiers.

00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:42.102
[VERGO]
What exactly is Caesar doing?

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.355
Well, I can't say
I know the details.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:49.109
But he did finally awaken his
beloved pet, Smiley, so...

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.404
...I assume he's planning
some sort of big experiment.

00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:55.532
Not just big, but it looks
like quite a dangerous one,

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.534
if you ask me.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.286
By the way, Vergo.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:00.370
[VERGO]
Hm?

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:04.208
[MONET] Did you have a
steak for breakfast today?

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.543
Yes, it's my favorite.
How did you know?

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:09.963
You're wearing some.
Just a little.

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:14.301
[VERGO]
Hm. I'd like to get...

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.304
...a quick look at the
experiment before I go.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:19.890
So, everyone outside will die?

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.310
[MONET] Probably. But don't
worry, you're safe in here.

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.938
Hey! Vergo!

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:27.147
Those men out there!

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:29.566
You know they're all
G-5 soldiers, right?

00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:31.235
They're your soldiers!

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:33.445
And you're leaving
them to die?

00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:35.405
Yeah. Guess so.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.240
[gasps]

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.575
How could you?

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:39.910
[VERGO]
You know,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.664
it's hard to believe we've got
so many big names in one cell.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.457
It's quite a view.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:46.625
You're right.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:50.087
It's so funny seeing you two
locked up together again.

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.757
Oh yeah! Alabasta! That was
where you guys caught me

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.843
and Smokey that
one time, remember?

00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:57.469
Quiet, you dumbass!

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.263
--Huh?
--Stupid pirates.

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:01.932
Don't you realize the gravity
of the situation here?

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.935
So it's true. I... was right.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.312
I'm so disgusted.

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.023
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)] Yeah,
it's the worst-case scenario.

00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.859
Makes me sick, too.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.611
Those news articles
weren't simple mistakes.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.865
The reporters were deliberately
misled, because someone in G-5

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:21.285
wanted those abduction
reports covered up.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.036
So, they worked together.

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:25.956
Caesar abducted those
children and Vergo

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:30.127
passed all the incidents
off as accidents at sea.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:34.882
Of all people, the leader of
the base was a double agent!

00:19:34.923 --> 00:19:37.342
That may be
characteristic of G-5,

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.636
but it's a disgrace
for the Navy!

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:43.015
[grunts]
How could you do this?

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:47.060
Wait. I'm lost.
So he's a bad guy?

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:48.979
Indeed. I'm surprised.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:53.066
That's right. Though they
wouldn't really have noticed it.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.484
It's not like he changed.

00:19:54.484 --> 00:19:58.697
He's been a traitor since the
day that he joined the Navy.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:02.367
In fact. Vergo is a pirate.

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:05.245
All this time? But why?

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.664
[LAW] He enlisted in the Navy
on Joker's orders

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:10.167
before he made a
name for himself.

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.337
He started at the very
bottom and spent 15 years

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.339
rising through the ranks.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.424
Joker couldn't ask for a
more reliable

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:20.177
or convenient soldier
to work for him.

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.932
It's true. He works for Joker.
He has been from the beginning.

00:20:24.973 --> 00:20:26.350
Vergo!

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.352
Joker, huh? Hang on.

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.521
There's an underworld broker
by that name as well.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:34.858
I was such an idiot!
How did I never smell a rat

00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:37.277
when it was right
there under my nose?

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:40.364
Aw. You shouldn't beat
yourself up like that.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.533
Instead, you should commend
the rat for being clever enough

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:47.412
to elude the Great
White Hunter, Smoker.

00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:49.414
Ever since the day you
were transferred in

00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:52.042
from headquarters, I've been
on constant high alert.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.420
And it's irritating. I'm so
relieved I won't have to

00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.882
keep my head on
a swivel anymore.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:03.387
As for you, Law, you ran
your mouth too much.

00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.514
Did I not punish you enough?

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.560
[VERGO]
Ah, well. No matter.

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:15.315
You also said I'd be in serious
trouble if I ran into the G-5.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.609
But that's clearly not true.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:22.072
[VERGO] I've been in control of
the situation for a while now.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.574
I'm sure they won't suspect me.

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:27.911
And besides, on the off-chance
that they do find out

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:32.416
about this, I already know
what I'm going to do.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.334
I plan to--

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:37.713
Well, I assume you
can figure that out.

00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:43.802
Now then, Vice Admiral.
Captain Tashigi.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.766
You two will die here.

00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:53.437
That way, my secret
never leaves this room.

00:21:53.437 --> 00:21:57.607
I'll let Caesar handle
the soldiers outside.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:22:01.987
It had to be done.
This territory belongs to Joker.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:05.115
I can't allow anyone to walk out
of here knowing his identity,

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.200
can I?

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:10.704
And yes. I'll report your
deaths as mere accident,

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:12.205
as I always do.

00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:14.041
Damn you!

00:22:14.082 --> 00:22:15.625
[grunts]

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:18.628
Uh, hey. Who's this Joker?

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:26.386
[sighs] Well, I know Vergo...
because I know Joker.

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:27.304
Huh?

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:30.515
Yeah. I worked for him.

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:33.977
Joker is just a fake name
he uses on the black market.

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:40.150
[LAW] You know him.
In fact, you know him very well.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.152
Who is he? Tell us!

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:44.780
[LAW] One of the deadliest
pirates in the world.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.658
[LAW] He is a member
of the Seven Warlords,

00:22:48.658 --> 00:22:50.827
authorized by the
World Government.

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:02.672
Donquixote Doflamingo.

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:03.548
[grunts]

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.841
[gasps]

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:21.942
[NARRATOR] The revelation about
Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:23.777
leaves everyone stunned.

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:26.113
Meanwhile, Nami's group
is already at a severe

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:29.199
disadvantage against the
children and the horrifying

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:33.703
power of the Gas-Gas Fruit soon
makes the situation even worse.

00:23:33.703 --> 00:23:35.372
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:39.418
"Save the Children! The Master's
Evil Hands Close In!"

00:23:39.459 --> 00:23:42.379
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
