WEBVTT

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.971
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.974
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.710
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:13.079
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.520
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.489
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.526
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.925
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.895
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:47.100
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.235
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.906
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.807
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.177
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.846
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.517
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:06.186
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.089
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:14.194
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.533
[NARRATOR] Two years have passed
since the war in Marineford.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.870
Each of the Straw Hat Pirates
underwent individual training

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.606
and reunited at the
Sabaody Archipelago,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.876
ready to take the next
step into the New World.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.316
[LUFFY]
We're off to Fishman Island!

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.456
Wait a sec. What is that thing?

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.625
A fish? No.

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:48.861
[CARIBOU] Are you ready?
We only get one shot at this!

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.330
[CORIBOU]
Ready, brother!

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.464
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Ready, Captain!

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.899
[CARIBOU]
Before you say anything,

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.033
I know what you're thinking.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.002
Hey, you guys?

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.371
There's a ship-looking
thing coming our way.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.173
[CARIBOU]
Charge!

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.676
[roars]

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.347
[CHOPPER]
It's a pirate ship!

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.255
[LUFFY]
"Deadly Combat under the Sea!

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.924
The Demon of the Ocean Strikes!"

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:21.027
Run!

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:23.696
Hard to port, now!

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.604
Attack them, sea cow!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.174
[MOMOO roars]

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.509
Tenacious, aren't they?

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.211
That sound.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.046
They don't know when to quit!

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.416
What are these guys after?

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.187
Help me!

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.856
The bubble's about to pop!

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.691
Keep it up, sea cow!

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:52.792
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.027
I think they want
to board the ship!

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.862
Sea cow?

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:56.663
[gasps]

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.866
I know that noise
from somewhere.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.701
[roars]

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:05.371
The two bubbles are touching.
This is our big moment, brother!

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.708
Good! Is everybody ready?

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:09.942
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.211
Momoo, it's me!
We've met before!

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.147
You're from the
Arlong Pirates, right?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.914
[MOMOO]
Hm?

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.582
[NAMI]
Do you remember me?

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.819
Nami! I was at Arlong Park!

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.224
Hey, Luffy! Doesn't that
thing look kinda familiar?

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:27.493
I dunno.

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.896
[SANJI yells]

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.598
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Pistol!

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.670
Let's pay our new friends
a visit, shall we?

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.604
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:40.740
[laughs]

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:42.508
Hey! That guy's up to somethin'!

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:44.243
Stay out of our bubble!

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.978
Guess he's lookin'
for a fight, then.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.480
[CHOPPER screams]

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.248
[BROOK screams]

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.585
There's no time to waste!
Follow my lead!

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:54.120
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.256
[CARIBOU] Fools! They're
completely dumbfounded!

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.425
If they're gonna sit
there catching flies,

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.761
then we'll strike
while the iron is hot!

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:05.164
We'll smite this entire
crew... right now!

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.166
[USOPP, CHOPPER, BROOK scream]

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.134
[CARIBOU]
For glory!

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.503
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:14.741
Come along, men! We'll make
them beg us for mercy!

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.712
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
What?

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.013
[CARIBOU PIRATE A]
What's wrong, sea cow?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:22.448
[CARIBOU PIRATE B]
Don't panic!

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.483
That's not good!

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.685
We left Captain Caribou
on that ship back there!

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:27.854
Brother!

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.289
[laughs]

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:34.026
Now, it's time for
a little greeting!

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.232
Fire the gatling gun, men!
Shower them in bullets!

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.567
I want every last
one of them dead!

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.371
Send these Straw Hats to hell!

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:54.514
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.556
[screams]

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.762
[screams]

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.164
[CARIBOU]
No! Wait!

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.366
You're not going to throw
me into the water, are you?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.835
Please don't do that to me,
my friend, I'm begging you!

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:19.038
Come on, you're a reasonable
fellow, are you not?

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.441
By the way, you're
very good-looking!

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.109
I'm sure someone
like you understands

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.344
the value of human life, right?

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.047
And besides,
the gods are watching!

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.416
You'll be judged for this!

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.885
Oh, make up your
freakin' mind already!

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.887
Weren't you just about
to fire your gatling gun

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.856
and blast us all
to kingdom come?

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.691
Me? No!

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.694
I was just, uh... I was
just joking around!

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.129
I ain't laughin'.

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:45.031
Anyway, tell me.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:48.100
I know you're the captain of
that ship, but what's your name?

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.869
[CARIBOU]
That's Roronoa Zoro!

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:52.271
Uh, don't be ridiculous.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.707
What in the world makes you
think I would be the captain?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.809
I'm, uh... Oh!

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:00.646
Those ruffians were keeping me
as a... a slave, that's it!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.716
Boy! Whew! Glad that's over!

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.618
You know we're not
buying this, right?

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.119
Say, how's this?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.888
Do you think I could
stay on this nice ship

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.723
with you all for a little while?

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.225
Huh? Please?

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:15.561
Wow. I feel kinda sorry
for this poor loser.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.164
He's obviously lying!
Are you crazy?

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:20.766
What?! Seriously?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.068
Hey, I have a question.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.004
Where'd that giant sea cow
pulling your ship come from?

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.472
Hello.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.407
[chuckles]

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:32.745
Oh, my... He-he.
Who's this vixen?

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:35.248
I take it you're the
famous cat burglar.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.015
Watch it, pal.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:37.183
Nobody's allowed to drool

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:40.286
over our beautiful
navigator except for me!

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:44.023
Don't worry.
You're perfectly sa--

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:45.424
[yells]

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:48.327
Hey, that's getting
really old! Cut it out!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.363
The sea cow? Who knows?

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.432
I just happened to catch it
out in the ocean somewhere.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:54.534
When you're underwater,

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.435
having a sea monster
pull your ship

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.938
is the mark of an
experienced captain.

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.041
Huh? Awesome!

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.609
[chuckles]

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.545
[CARIBOU PIRATE D]
Stop it, sea cow!

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.979
[CARIBOU PIRATE E]
What's the problem?

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:13.519
Brother! We're on our
way to rescue you!

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.860
[LUFFY] I'm gonna find
a sea monster, too!

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.996
[NAMI] What crazy ideas are
you hatching now, Luffy?

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.632
Uhh... Ooh! Hmm...

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.302
Turtles? Nah, too small.

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:30.970
Jeez.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.505
We should try to
rehabilitate him

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.840
with something
a little less sexy.

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:36.642
Hey, Nami, the
direction we're taking

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:39.579
isn't exactly the same way
Log Pose is pointing.

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.480
Oh. No problem.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.916
The correct course is
technically southwest,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.051
so we're in the clear.

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.919
Yeah, but if we went
in a straight line,

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:49.221
we could get there
a whole lot faster.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:49.922
Couldn't we?

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.023
Well, if you go straight,

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.225
you risk getting swept
away in a sea current,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.660
and if that should happen,

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:57.730
you might run into an underwater
mountain or a volcano, see?

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:58.564
That's why.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.901
Huh? Yikes! I'm with
you on this one!

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.537
Yeah, but I thought all the
currents here were dangerous.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.706
It is the Grand Line, after all.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.508
So are you saying that some
of them are actually stable?

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.377
Well, this one is.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.013
That should do it.
Now you stay put.

00:10:14.046 --> 00:10:17.016
Hey, it's gonna start getting
colder from here on out

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.018
so make sure you put on
a coat or something.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.219
You bring up a good point.

00:10:20.252 --> 00:10:23.222
I'm already starting to feel
goosebumps on my skin.

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.690
Well, except for I--

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:28.427
You don't have any skin
because you're a skeleton.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.029
[groans]

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:33.866
[BROOK] Chopper... skull jokes
are the only thing I have.

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:36.302
Please don't take
that away from me.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:39.405
[ZORO] We're going somewhere
cold? Not the deep sea?

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:42.308
[FRANKY] Don't you guys know the
water's cold in the deep sea?

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.309
It's just like a bathtub--

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.379
hot water rises and cold
sinks to the bottom.

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:49.415
Oh, does it? I don't
take very many baths.

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:52.718
Ah-ha! 'Cause heat rises and
there's not much sunlight,

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.121
so there's nothing to heat
the water down here.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.889
[BROOK] The temperature's
not the only thing

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.924
that's different at the bottom.

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.160
You're not still
depressed are you?!

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:05.064
Once we move down, we'll find
something called deep currents.

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.899
You don't run into
them terribly often,

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:09.902
but they're much larger
than the regular currents.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.071
Also, they're quite unique
in that their flow

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.639
is completely independent
of what you see

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.107
closer to the surface.

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.175
Currents under the currents

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.144
and you even have
a diagram, huh?

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.812
You sure do know a lot of stuff!

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.247
[laughs]

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.082
That's because I'm so old!

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.050
Not only that,

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.619
but all currents are
connected to each other.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:29.855
But that doesn't mean they have
to flow in the same direction.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:33.259
They flow east,
west, up, and down.

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:36.162
It's like a big, long
dragon, all tangled up.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.630
[BROOK]
The deep currents tend to travel

00:11:37.663 --> 00:11:39.532
at a surprisingly slow pace.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.133
After they reach the deep sea,

00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:43.202
it takes approximately
2,000 years

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.704
before they finally
make their way

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.672
up to the surface of the water.

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.974
That makes me feel
young again, actually.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.843
[ALL]
Two thousand?

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.512
[BROOK]
Yes, 2,000.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.148
And because of that,
there are countless tales

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:59.985
about what lurks within
those dark deep currents.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:04.990
Monsters. Curses.
The wrath of the undead!

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.058
[screams]

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.027
You mean the deep
sea is haunted?

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.329
What? The sea's haunted? Help!

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.831
That sounds fun to me!

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.699
Calm down, guys.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.202
I don't know anything about
the wrath of the undead,

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.903
or whatever you're
freaking out about,

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.238
but I do know that
we'll encounter

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.006
a downward-flowing current soon.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.745
Once we do, we should be able to
ride it down into the deep sea.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.346
Deep sea.

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.148
Surface.

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:31.083
Moves downward.

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.518
Flow.

00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:33.919
Womp-womp.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:38.390
[ALL] She said something about
deep sea currents, I dunno.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.193
You morons could at least
pretend like you understand me!

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:43.496
[BROOK laughs]

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.064
[BROOK]
Shall we sing a duet, Nami?

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.365
[NAMI]
Shut up!

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.301
[ROBIN]
Hm?

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.037
Huh?

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:56.041
[ALL sigh]

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.676
I hear something.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.411
It's here.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.180
Nami, I see it!

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:02.348
[NAMI]
Really?

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:03.516
Let's check it out!

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:06.452
[ALL laughing]

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:09.054
That's freakin' sweet!

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:10.756
--[CHOPPER] Whoa!
--Amazing!

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.226
I admit, whatever that
thing is, it's pretty cool.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.696
This one's called
the Downward Plume.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.031
[gasps]

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.133
Cool!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.836
It's almost like
a giant waterfall.

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:29.275
[USOPP]
Except underwater!

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.592
It's going so fast!

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.461
The sea is like falling
into the sea!

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:52.498
Which doesn't make
sense, but I like it!

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.402
Mother Nature,
you're one crazy lady!

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.404
What a spectacular sight.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:01.340
And from the looks of it, I'd
say the stream runs fairly deep.

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.175
I've heard stories
about these currents,

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.811
but they did not
do them justice!

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.746
Ah! It's crazy dark down there!

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.849
The floor's so far,
you can't even see it!

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.584
We're dead!

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:13.118
At this speed, we're
gonna get pile-driven

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.820
straight down to the bottom!

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.989
[screams]

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:20.159
[NAMI] You sure it's safe
if we just go with the flow?

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:22.361
[FRANKY] If you're worried
about the ship, don't be.

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:24.930
Sunny was built from the
treasure tree Adam.

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.932
It's as tough as they come!

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:31.537
Okay! Let's go!

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.106
[CARIBOU]
Uh? Is that--?

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:37.276
Crap. So it really
does live down here!

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:39.278
It's no legend.

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:45.317
[roaring]

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:53.025
[CARIBOU] A demon that
rules over the deep seas.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:57.796
The enemy of all mankind.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.289
Please, listen to me Straw Hats!

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:26.825
We have to turn back!
We're gonna die!

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:28.594
[ZORO] Oh, yeah.
I forgot you were here.

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.562
There's a sea monster!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.797
[screams]

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.367
Cut it out already.
There's no monster.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:47.146
[roars]

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.753
They're just stories.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.589
Somebody made that
up to scare people.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.158
[NAMI, CHOPPER gasp]

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.359
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.032
Uh... Usopp?

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.101
Jeez, what is the
matter with you guys?

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:11.370
Uh... look.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.605
Just spit it out.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.907
Oh?

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:21.447
Uh-oh. It's here?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.048
Uh-huh.

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.487
[USOPP]
Okay.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.689
[screams]

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:36.962
[USOPP]
It's the kraken!

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.130
[BOTH scream]

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:41.467
The legendary giant
octopus monster!

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.336
[FRANKY] He made fish
food outta those ships.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.706
They left for the New World
and never made it.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.144
Turn around! Please, I'm not
ready to die! I beg you!

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:55.647
Just wait around for a couple
days and it'll probably go away!

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.650
[LUFFY]
Hey, shut up for a second!

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.686
I just had a perfect idea!

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:04.723
Guys, we just have
to capture it!

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.525
[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:08.827
Have you lost your mind, Luffy?

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.828
[LUFFY]
Well, if we catch it,

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.697
we can teach it how
to pull the ship!

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.899
[USOPP]
Like hell we can!

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.434
I'd tell you to take
a good look at it,

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:16.702
but it's so ridiculously huge,

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:19.004
I don't know how in the world
you could miss the damn thing!

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:21.273
Yeah, that is big.

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:23.075
We're all gonna die!

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:25.411
[USOPP] It must've been
here for centuries!

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:28.247
The kraken shows up in myths
from all over the world!

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.584
It's one of the most terrible
monsters that ever lived!

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:37.523
It doesn't have any bones,
and I am only bones...

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:38.524
That's interesting.

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:41.026
I wonder if it enjoys
making no-skull jokes.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.629
Yeah, I doubt it!

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:45.898
[FRANKY] Hey, you're
a pretty good artist.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:48.100
I wanted to capture
the moment on paper.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.135
Drawing pictures?! Really?!

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:53.539
I'll help you out.
You've got a plan, right?

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:57.109
Problem is, there's not
much we can do underwater.

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.478
No. No. No.

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.881
The problem is,
the thing's gigantic.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.617
We couldn't even take it
on above sea level.

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:08.220
[CARIBOU]
What is wrong with these people?

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.588
Anybody in their right mind

00:18:09.621 --> 00:18:12.057
would've run for
the hills by now!

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.560
What's taking them
so long to decide?

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.062
We're leaving!
Shift the helm due south!

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.731
Hey, Nami! Let's go
straight towards it!

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.467
[NAMI]
Don't be stupid! That thing is--

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.304
[SANJI] It's okay, Nami.
I'm here for y--

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:27.306
Here for...

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:31.410
...for you.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.146
You held it in! Good job!

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.581
We made him all better!

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.083
Well, it helps that Nami
put on a coat, too.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.818
[CARIBOU]
I'm not safe on this ship.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.753
I'll have to protect myself.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.256
Somethin's coming up behind us.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:45.424
[SURUME roars]

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:46.592
Huh?

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.094
[CORIBOU]
Brother!

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.429
[USOPP]
These guys again?

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:53.432
Ah! I'm so happy you
came back for me!

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.868
Let's rush in there
and rescue my bro!

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.336
[CARIBOU PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.472
You're the best crew
a captain could ask for!

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:08.547
Stop it!

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.217
[CHOPPER, USOPP, BROOK scream]

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.119
[CHOPPER]
It destroyed the coating!

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.421
[USOPP] That ship's
bigger than the Sunny!

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.994
No! They didn't make it!

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:26.732
[CARIBOU cries]

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:31.737
Like jellyfish.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.773
Dammit, Roronoa!
That's too cruel!

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.377
[USOPP]
Here it comes!

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.181
It's so huge!

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:45.083
There's no way we can fight
against a monster like that!

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:46.151
Now, Third Gear--

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.654
No!

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:51.623
If you do that, you'll break
the bubble for sure!

00:19:53.292 --> 00:19:57.162
Chicken... Voyage!

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:59.731
Can't we--Ah!--escape somehow?

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.201
[LUFFY]
Wait, let me take care of it.

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.335
Don't go!

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.604
If you pop the bubble,
then we all die!

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:07.206
The little fellow's right!

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.708
But if you wanna face
the kraken that badly,

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.177
I might just have
the idea for you!

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.914
Fine, what is it?
Make it snappy!

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.517
There! Perfect!

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.620
That contraption is called
the Flutter Kick Coating.

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:24.356
It's an extravehicular
diving suit.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.258
As long as you stay inside it,

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:29.361
you can fight underwater
as much as you need to.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:31.230
Pretty amazing, right?

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:33.198
[CARIBOU]
If I let them call the shots,

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.200
we'll all go to hell
in a handbasket.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.436
Hey, you weren't
supposed to do that!

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.972
The rest of us wanted
to get out of here!

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.307
Now they're gonna stay and
try to fight that thing!

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.143
I've been telling you all to
run away from the beginning,

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:48.213
but your fearless leader was
having none of that, now was he?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.214
Think of it this way,

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:51.250
would you rather have
them fight it outside

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.051
or fight it right here
on the ship?

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.953
Right! You guys get out there!

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:55.887
Far, far away!

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.422
This rope's kinda annoying.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.058
Remember to stay as far
from the ship as you can!

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.960
Sure.

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.595
Well, you ready?

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.663
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.233
Huh? Wait a sec!

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.836
You guys forgot
the safety ropes!

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:13.272
You're gonna get separated!

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:16.308
Sounds like Nami's
worried about me.

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:17.776
Listen up!

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.845
I need both of you guys
to distract him.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:22.281
If I can get one good punch off,
I think I can take him!

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:25.250
Why don't I just slice him
to pieces? It'd be easier.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.586
'Cause that wouldn't
do me any good!

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:30.455
I wanna capture him
and keep him as a pet!

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.525
[CHOPPER]
Careful, guys.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:36.428
Yeah, and keep your distance!
'Cause every centimeter counts.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.996
[BOTH scream]

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.365
[USOPP]
Okay, that was way too close!

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:43.869
All right, stand back!

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:45.504
Franky...

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.838
[BOTH gasping]

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.440
[gasps]

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:51.176
...Rocket Launcher!

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:55.480
[USOPP]
Got 'im!

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.349
[CHOPPER]
That was incredible!

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:58.450
[BOTH scream]

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.819
[USOPP]
Not another one!

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.554
[CHOPPER]
How many arms does it have?

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:05.057
It's gonna hit us!

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.658
Guard Point!

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.362
Whoa! It hit the
ship pretty hard!

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:13.865
[CHOPPER]
Everyone okay?

00:22:13.899 --> 00:22:16.301
[USOPP]
He... He saved us!

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.336
Thanks, buddy!

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.338
Nice one, Chopper!

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:24.676
[BROOK] We're about to be
crushed against that mountain!

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.813
[gasps] Now, Mil Fleurs!

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.315
Gigantesco Mano!

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:33.385
[ALL screaming]

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.154
[CHOPPER]
Wow, those hands are big!

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:37.255
[gasps]

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.725
--[FRANKY] Yeah!
--[CHOPPER] Woo-hoo!

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:42.494
Nice one, Robin!
That was close!

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:43.762
[BROOK laughing]

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:44.996
Thank goodness.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.532
I was only in the water
for the briefest moment,

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:49.534
so my power held out.

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.536
Everybody did great!

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.040
Now, guess it's my turn!

00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:57.509
I'll use my new special move.

00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.679
[LUFFY exhales]

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.614
Third Gear.

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.294
[NARRATOR] Luffy, Zoro, and
Sanji leave the relative safety

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:19.798
of the Sunny to face the
kraken in its own territory.

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:21.967
Putting their powerful
new skills to work,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.468
they survive the encounter,

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:26.471
only to be swept away
by a downward current.

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:28.640
Now, separated from
the rest of the crew,

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:31.543
they become lost in
the murky depths.

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:33.145
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:36.815
"Lost in the Deep Sea!
The Straw Hats Get Separated!"

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:39.251
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
