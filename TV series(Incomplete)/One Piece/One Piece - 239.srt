tell me why we're fighting?

[PAULIE] I think we're
the ones who deserve

5
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,219
an explanation here, not you.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,156
Someone broke into
Iceberg's house last night

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,824
and shot him five times!

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,525
They were from your crew!

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,579
Iceberg was shot?
Thats news to me.

10
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,519
That can't be, we--

11
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,123
No way!

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,292
We didn't shoot Ice Pops...
That's just crazy!

13
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:04,164
Listen kid, you
might as well fess up.

14
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,166
I'm telling you,
we didn't do it!

15
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,701
[PAULIE]
Iceberg said it himself.

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,103
There were two people who broke

17
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,071
into his room and attacked him.

18
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,606
He may have been hurt
but that doesn't mean

19
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,775
he didn't get a
good look at them first.

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,312
One of them was a
big guy with a mask on.

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:22,116
The other was a tall
woman with black hair.

22
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,118
Iceberg told us
he recognized her

23
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,185
and the government confirmed

24
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,455
that she's a
member of your crew.

25
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:32,693
The Archaeologist, Nico Robin.

26
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,327
You're lying.

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,701
I won't ask you
why--maybe your crew

28
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,305
came to Water 7 on a
mission to kill Iceberg.

29
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,574
Or maybe you really did
want your ship repaired

30
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,777
and attacked him on a whim
after we turned you down.

31
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,681
I don't know how you
pirates think and I don't care.

32
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,482
Point is, you tried
to kill my boss

33
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,452
and now I'm gonna
have to take you down.

34
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,354
[CITIZEN A] So he's
one of the culprits?

35
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,790
Tie him up Paulie,
don't let that pirate go!

36
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,391
This is bad.

37
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,462
So he got shot five times,
but Iceberg's still alive?

38
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,064
Don't look so surprised.

39
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,266
That guy's as tough as nails!

40
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,436
But if they tried it once
then these scumbags

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,439
might try to go after
Iceberg a second time, too.

42
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,774
So we're gonna
settle this now.

The World Government
doesn't care either way.

This is what it means to
have a bounty on your head.

Therefore, you can't complain.

your fate may be.

You've broken the law

That's right.

if you make an
enemy out of Iceberg.

wanna get rid of me!

Okay, come on.
We need to get going.

183

I'm not sure how, but
we've gotta talk to Ice Pops.

What? Now?

is out searching for us?

Uh-oh.

Well, he's not on
the deck at least.

198

Maybe he's still
too hurt to move.

But if we don't want
him to recognize us,

getting any closer.

something about a storm?

is awfully strong, isn't it?

Nah that last Coupe de Vent
I did ate up all my fuel.

You see this?
My pompadour's limp.

a willow swaying in the wind.

What a mess. Stupid Galley-La.

I'll take care of that Straw Hat
as soon as I'm done refueling.

Hahaha.

But that kid ain't
half bad, y'know.

235
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:58,258
He certainly earned
his big bounty. Hahahaha!

this is too much.

240
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,605
we can't let Straw Hat escape.

241
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,475
Aqua Laguna is
gonna hit tonight.

242
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:17,778
There are only two Sea Train
departures left today.

243
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,514
Since the Straw Hats
can't leave on their ship

244
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,749
the Sea Train's the only ticket

245

they've got to
get off the island.

246
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,786
This is our chance.

Have every member
of Galley-La spread out

248
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,090
and hunt them down.

this before sunset!

If that isn't Galley-La HQ,
I don't know what is.

No surprise since it's right
next to Dock One. And look.

The place is totally
swarming with reporters.

256
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:21,408
Those tough-looking guys
are probably shipwrights.

257
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,477
I'm willing to bet
that's where Iceberg's at.

You sure about this?

Of course I am.

The only way for me to
find out what's going on

261
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,626
between Ice Pops and
Robin is to ask him myself.

262
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,728
I can't stop you but
you should keep in mind

263
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:42,096
that everyone
on the island

us down right now.

So listen, before
you do anything rash,

sneak around and figure
out where Iceberg's room

267
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,272
is so you know
where you need to go.

you're far too noisy.

his peace and quiet.
