00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:24,977
[COBY]
Uh?

177
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,979
[HELMEPPO]
Yeah, that's it. Let's do that.

178
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,181
Really, if we're missing
no one's even gonna‐‐

179
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,117
[COBY]
Hey! Come back here!

180
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,820
Helmeppo, I don't understand
what you're saying!

181
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,189
I thought you decided you
were gonna beat your father!

182
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,291
Well. That's what
I was thinking,

183
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,660
but I'll die if I try
to do that stuff!

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,161
But wouldn't that be all right?

185
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,830
[HELMEPPO whimpers]

186
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,033
Once you've decided
to do something...

187
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,735
Well, I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

188
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,171
Once you have a dream
like that in your sights.

189
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,707
I decided that a long time ago.

190
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,842
So if I die...

191
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,244
If you have to die fighting
for your ultimate dream,

192
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,581
then that should be
all right with you!

193
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,684
[HELMEPPO] That's kind of
extreme, don't you think?

194
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,054
[COBY]
You have to fight.

195
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,856
You can't give up!

196
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,057
Please don't ever say

197
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,226
that you're going to
run away, all right?!

198
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,695
‐‐[HELMEPPO] Well...
‐‐[GARP] Running away, huh?

199
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,763
[GARP]
Idiots!

200
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,066
Boys, you aren't planning
to disgrace me

201
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,934
after I brought
you here, are you?

202
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,937
Pathetic wimps!

203
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,241
I can replace two
chore boys very easily.

204
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,878
So go ahead and run
away if you want.

205
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,546
Please wait, sir!

206
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,882
We won't run away, I promise!

207
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,716
[GARP]
Hmm?

208
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,718
We've come with you
to headquarters

209
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,887
fully prepared to
die if necessary!

210
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:44,690
We'll carry out any orders you
give us, Vice‐Admiral Garp!

211
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,896
[HELMEPPO gasping]

212
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,066
[GARP] You're ready to
carry out any orders.

213
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,137
Is that what you two
are telling me?

214
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,140
You're willing to die here?

215
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,075
Is that what you said?!

216
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,243
[BOTH whimpering]

217
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,245
Yes... sir.

218
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,282
[GARP] Then quit hiding in
a corner and get to work!

219
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,883
[HELMEPPO, COBY]
Yes!

220
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,257
[GARP]
Continue keeping an eye on them.

221
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,928
[BOGART]
Right.

222
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
[RIKA]
What?!

223
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,584
Marine Headquarters?!

224
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,651
Yeah.

225
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:49,622
Vice‐Admiral Garp can be
very unpredictable at times.

226
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,991
[RIKA'S MOM] He's pretty high up
on the food chain though, right?

227
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,960
Yes, very high up.

228
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,128
Then those two must have
been very promising

229
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,831
to have caught his
attention like that.

230
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,503
[RIKA]
Stupid! Stupid!

231
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,606
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

232
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,474
[MARINES muttering]

233
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,843
Why did you let them go
without saying goodbye?!

234
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,713
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

235
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:18,651
[RIKA] I still wanted to play
with them some more.

236
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,953
And I wanted to
talk to them more.

237
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,124
I was even learning how to cook.
I wanted to make them a yummy

238
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,627
lunch next time they
came over but...

239
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,862
...but now I can't!

240
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:34,200
I didn't even get to... to say
goodbye before they left!

241
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,702
[MARINE A]
Uh... I...

242
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,038
[RIKA]
Why did they have to leave?!

243
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,540
[MARINE A] Ahh! I'm sorry.
Please forgive me!

244
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,708
[RIKA'S MOM]
Rika, that's enough.

245
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,678
Leave him alone now, dear.
You don't have to be so sad.

246
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,915
They'll come back after they've
become fine marine officers.

247
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,523
[HELMEPPO]
Uh, what good is this?

248
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,593
How are we supposed to become
marines by mopping floors?

249
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,528
Did you ever think that
maybe this is just a hobby

250
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,929
that old geezer has?

251
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,897
A hobby?

252
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,198
Yeah.

253
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,934
A new hobby called "tormenting
poor chore boys just for fun."

254
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,870
I'm telling you, the
old man's crazy enough

255
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,838
that it might be true.
Think about it for a sec.

256
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,041
Would you birds stop chirping?!

257
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,763
[HELMEPPO] The old man sure is
quick to resort to violence.

258
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,265
[COBY]
His name's Vice‐Admiral Garp.

259
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,399
[HELMEPPO]
Hey,

260
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,702
did you know that his nickname
is "Garp the Fist"?

261
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,037
Apparently he's real
strong and powerful!

262
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,972
Supposedly, everyone's
afraid of him‐‐

263
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,107
even in the marines!

264
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,576
[COBY] No wonder his punch hurt
even more than Alvida's!

265
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,944
No, that isn't the point!

266
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,646
Can we just quit talking
about this stuff?!

267
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,082
Now isn't the time!
We have studying to do!

268
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,918
If you wanna get in trouble,
don't take me down with you.

269
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,654
[HELMEPPO] Jeez, I was just
trying to blow off some steam.

270
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,091
I thought you'd understand.
We're friends, aren't we?

271
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,625
You only say that whenever

272
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,662
it's convenient for you.
If you're really my friend,

273
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,630
then you'll take this
work more seriously.

274
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,100
[HELMEPPO]
Okay, okay. I'll try.

275
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,809
[HELMEPPO]
Never mind. I quit.

276
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,644
[COBY]
Huh?!

277
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,979
[HELMEPPO]
I really just want to go back to

278
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,749
what my life used to be like!

279
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,185
No! There's no point in even
thinking about that right now!

280
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,187
Of course, if we
were marine officers,

281
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,289
it would be a much
different story.

282
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,124
[HELMEPPO]
Hm...

283
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,625
There you go!

284
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,659
[COBY]
What?

285
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,194
[HELMEPPO] We can't run
away, and if we slack off,

286
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,630
we get punched, so there's
really only one way

287
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,199
for me to get my life
back to how it used to be.

288
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,803
I have to become an important
person really quickly!

289
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,139
You haven't thought
this through.

290
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,775
There is no way things
will happen that easily.

291
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:59,311
We have to build up over time,
working steadily and patiently.

292
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,181
There isn't always
an easy way out.

293
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,049
What are you doing?

294
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,684
[HELMEPPO] Mopping floors
and waiting around

295
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,220
isn't going to do
us any good here.

296
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,158
I'm going to go and
do some real work.

297
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,226
Right, yeah.

298
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,062
We're already way too wiped out
from doing a thousand chores

299
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,298
during the day to start
working out at night.

300
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,667
Let's just go to bed.

301
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,169
I've already decided.

302
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,403
[COBY]
What?

303
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,673
I'll become a big‐shot officer
and go back to my old life,

304
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,875
and I'll be stronger
than my dad.

305
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,844
That's what I've decided.

306
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,246
Well that's a nice idea...

307
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,715
But there's no way your
body can handle it!

308
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,018
Never, never, never, never,
never, never, never!

309
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,153
It won't work.
You're gonna die first!

310
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,089
[HELMEPPO] Once you've really
decided to do something,

311
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,858
if you die fighting for it,

312
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,028
that should be all right
with you. Right?

313
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,165
[HELMEPPO]
Well, I've already decided,

314
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,900
and I'm ready to start fighting.

315
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,169
Okay, so maybe I don't
really want to die.

316
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,171
But there's no turning
back for me now.

317
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,841
I'll go as far as
I can from here.

318
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,709
I'll see you later.

319
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,944
[COBY]
Wait! Please!

320
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,111
[HELMEPPO]
Hm?

321
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,948
What is it, Coby?

322
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,883
I'm sorry, Helmeppo.

323
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,221
I was beginning to sound like
my old, scared self once again.

324
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,455
You're right.

325
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,024
The question we have to answer
isn't whether or not we can

326
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,027
do it, but whether or not
we have the will to do it.

327
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,363
So I've come to a decision, too.

328
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,764
You're right Helmeppo.

329
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,034
If we really try
we can succeed.

330
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,737
So come on! Let's go do this!

331
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,706
[HELMEPPO]
Huh...?

332
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,211
Fine with me if you
want to come.

333
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,314
Now we can compete to see which
one of us will last the longest!

334
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,949
[COBY]
Well, I'm up for it,

335
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,118
but I sure hope
you're ready to lose!

336
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,987
Oh, yeah.
I'll see you down there.

337
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,088
‐‐You'd better hurry!
‐‐[COBY] Huh?!

338
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,389
[COBY]
You can't just leave me behind!

339
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,891
[HELMEMPPO]
Really, why not?

340
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,158
It's not like we're
friends or anything,

341
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,160
so I don't have to wait
for you to catch up.

342
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,262
[COBY]
Hold on a second!

343
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,398

saying earlier, Helmeppo!

353
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,287
[MARINE B]
So this is Straw Hat Luffy,

354
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,856
the pirate whose head is
worth 30 million berries.

355
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,159
[MARINE D] We have to capture
such a dirty criminal like him

356
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,127
quickly and execute
him right away.

357
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,129
[MARINE C]
Absolutely!

358
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,303
[COBY] There's a bounty
on Luffy's head!

359
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,172
I don't know how that could be!

360
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,374
[HELMEPPO] Don't you get it?
A pirate is a pirate.

361
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,010
They'll catch him, and once
they do, they'll execute him.

362
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,346
[COBY] I know that, but it
doesn't mean I have to like it!

363
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,314
It's not that easy to accept!

364
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,017
Luffy and I became really
good friends, you know?

365
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,018
[HELMEPPO]
Shh!

366
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,852
Don't be dumb!

367
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,554
No marine has a
pirate for a friend!

368
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,023
You can't ever say
that out loud again.

369
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,326
You'll be kicked out of
the marines for sure!

370
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,228
Yeah, I figured that out myself.

371
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,364
It's not like I'd say that
if there was anyone else

372
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,366
around here
but you, Helmeppo!

373
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,101
That better be true.

374
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,068
Jeez.

[COBY, HELMEPPO]
V‐V‐Vice‐Admiral Garp, sir!

377
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,375
What's this?

378
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,244
You boys were talking about
something interesting.

379
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,079
I think I'd like
to hear about it.

380
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,081
What was that about your friend?

381
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,217
[HELMEPPO, COBY whimper]

382
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,452
You'll be coming with me now.

383
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,462
[GARP]
I'll ask you again.

384
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,264
The two of you are
friends with the pirate

385
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,932
known as Straw Hat Luffy?

386
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,435
[COBY]
Helmeppo isn't, but I am, sir.

387
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,271
Luffy and I are friends‐‐
even if he is a pirate

388
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,408
with a 30 million berry
bounty on his head.

389
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,609
All right.

390
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,612
Surely you're aware that we
simply cannot allow a marine

391
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:27,913
to be friends with a pirate.

392
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:32,551
But fortunately for you, chore
boy, I'm the only one who knows.

393
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,287
Tell me, do you want
to be a marine?

394
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,256
If you would please
just listen to me.

395
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,957
It's true that Luffy
and I are friends,

396
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,393
but Helmeppo doesn't know
anything about it, really.

397
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,228
[HELMEPPO]
We do want to be marines.

398
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,897
We're working
as hard as we can.

399
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,498
What are you doing?

400
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,633
Moron.

401
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,969
He isn't the least bit
interested in our explanations.

402
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,906
We're in this together.
Isn't that what we decided?

403
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,442
[GARP]
And what about you, Coby?

404
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,810
Do you want to be a marine?

405
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,411
[COBY]
Yes, I do!

406
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,979
[GARP] Then quit standing
there and prove it!

407
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,948
Let's see if you can fight me!

408
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:10,856
[GARP]
Heh.

That's right!

00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,997
[HELMEPPO pants]
Yeah.

We aren't even close
to dead yet!

419
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,535
You wanna die that badly?

420
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,872
[COBY] I've decided to
become a marine officer.

421
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,407
And if I have to die
fighting for that dream,

422
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,842
that's fine with me.

423
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,578
No way we're giving
in so easily!

424
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,716
I will become an officer!
Do you hear me?!

425
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,391
[laughs] A marine officer?!

426
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,660
That's the best joke
I've heard in years!

427
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:26,899
[GARP laughs]

428
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,380
[GARP] People around
here have been saying

429
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,383
that I'm a bit eccentric
for quite a long time.

430
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,918
They had even more
to say this time,

431
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,787
when I decided to bring
you two to headquarters.

432
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,955
Since I brought you here,

433
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,425
I'm the one responsible for
training you to be useful.

434
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,029
I tested you two tonight to see
what you were really made of.

435
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,897
[COBY]
What we're made of?

436
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,433
[GARP] Although it certainly
appears that you've been working

437
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,436
to strengthen your bodies.
I thought that inside your minds

438
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,772
and your hearts,
you might still be weak.

439
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,976
So I tested you to see how truly
determined you have become.

440
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,912
[HELMEPPO]
So, what's the verdict then?

441
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,448
[GARP] I'm willing to
acknowledge your determination,

442
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,750
but that said...

443
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:23,121
[laughs] You still have
a long way to go!

444
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,958
When it comes to weakness,
you boys are truly impressive!

445
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,794
You'll have an intense special
training session every day.

446
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,128
So be prepared!

[GARP laughs]

448
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,003
[GARP] And I'll keep an eye
on your friend's situation.

449
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,472
But don't tell anyone.

450
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,408
This will just be
our little secret.
