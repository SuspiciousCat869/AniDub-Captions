1
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,584
There's just one more
thing I want to tell you.

2
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,490
Slow-Slow Beam!

3
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,296
You should've learned your
lesson by now, Straw Hat!

4
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,365
Everyone knows, the
Silver Fox never forgets

5
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,435
a grudge and he
always gets what he wants.

6
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,671
Your fate was sealed the moment
you set foot on this ship!

7
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,640
[STRAW HATS scream]

8
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,811
This time, I'll settle
things once and for all.

9
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,646
And you'll have no
choice but to admit

10
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,782
that the Foxy Pirates are
the strongest in the world!

11
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,350
Feh-feh-feh!

12
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,230
[FOXY CREW cheers]

13
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,232
[FOXY CREW]
Boss!

14
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,767
Porche!

15
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,103
Hamburg!

16
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,704
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

17
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,139
[HAMBURG]
Puh-puh-puh!

18
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,208
The Straw Hats bit the dust.

19
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,477
[PORCHE] That was lovely
Boss, but what's next?

20
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,411
What do you think?

21
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,580
We're gonna humiliate
them the same way

22
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,083
they humiliated us in
that last Davy Back Fight!

23
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,653
All right you two,
let's begin Operation D!

24
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:10,190
[CREW cheers]

25
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,528
Do you hear that?
Sounds like a party.

26
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,497
I wonder what everyone's
doing over there.

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,066
Why don't you go pay
them a visit and find out?

28
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,768
I should be fine watching
the ship on my own.

29
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,236
If something bad happened,

30
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,772
I wouldn't want you to
get left here by yourself!

31
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,240
Besides, I'd rather
stick around and study.

32
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,312
[LUFFY] Why you gotta
be so tricky all the time,

33
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:32,279
Split Head?!

34
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,415
If you want a fight,
then come and get it!

35
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,317
Auugh!!

36
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,352
Calm down Luffy,
it'll be okay.

37
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,687
That afro might make you strong,

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,122
but right now I think
it's making you crazy!

39
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,826
Yep, Figures. All that afro
power has gotta go somewhere.

40
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,661
Please tell me that's
supposed to be a joke.

41
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,229
Getting revenge is one thing,

42
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,799
but using us to take out
his enemies is pretty low.

43
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,068
So what if you had to
beat up a couple of losers,

44
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,502
I'm more worried about our gold!

45
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,303
Any way you look at it,

46
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,105
he bit off more
than he can chew.

47
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,474
He should know better
than to get on our bad side.

48
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,677
We'll tear this sorry ship
to pieces in no time flat!

49
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,779
You can't beat the five of us!

50
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,351
Or the four of you at least.

51
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,752
[collective sighs]

52
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,754
Well anyway, before
we can wreak any havoc

53
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,389
we have to find
a way out of here.

54
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,790
And since this is Foxy's ship,

55
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,493
I'm sure there's some
dirty trick involved.

56
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,728
I think we can just
break through the wall.

57
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,532
Huh?

58
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,234
[SANJI]
What the hell is this place?

59
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,738
[FOXY] Choppy! Choppy,
wherever could you be?

60
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,207
Are you hiding from me again?

61
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,546
Jeez! If you don't come out,
I'll have to punish you!

62
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,417
[ROBIN]
Is something the matter, Doctor?

63
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,085
Uh... No, it's nothing.

64
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,121
Why you!

65
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,656
This is the lamest trick
you could possibly pull!

66
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,057
Let me handle this.

67
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,091
Luffy?

68
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,764
Listen! I'm on to you!

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,232
Oh?

70
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,301
Tell me where you're
hiding Split-Head now!

71
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,236
[collective shocked sounds]

72
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't know what
you're talking about!

73
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,407
[LUFFY]
Wonder where he could be...

74
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,209
[ZORO] Even for Luffy,
this is pretty bad.

75
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,277
[NAMI]
Should we say something?

76
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,812
This is kinda awkward.

77
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,081
[SANJI] Let's just
see how this plays out.

78
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:17,051
Well, looks like
Split-Head's not here, guys.

79
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,186
Behind you!

80
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,687
Hmm? Huh?

81
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,191
Luffy, take a closer
look at that face.

82
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:29,563
Okay, but it looks
pretty normal to me.

83
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,497
You're not Porche!

84
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,099
You're Split-Head's
sister, aren't you?!

85
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,169
Ah!! This is getting me nowhere!

86
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,571
Feh-feh-feh!

87
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,274
Aaah! It was
Split-Head all along!

88
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,209
I'm gonna make you
pay for tricking me!

89
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,778
I don't know if I should
laugh or cry about this.

90
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:50,351
Say your prayers,
Straw Hat. Slow-Slow Beam!

91
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,686
Feh-feh-feh!

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,388
Haven't you fools
learned your lesson?

93
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,523
Sure, you can run
but my Slow-Slow Beam

94
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,525
will always find you!

95
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,694
Ugh! I've had about
enough of that thing.

96
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,329
Yeah, no kidding.

97
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,101
Slow-Slow Beam!

98
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,237
Look out!

99
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,273
Keep your hands off her!

100
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,673
Watch where you're going!

101
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,477
Sanji! Zoro!

102
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,345
No! They got hit!

103
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,748
I should've known
you'd dodge, Straw Hat!

104
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,082
You coward!

105
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,651
[LUFFY]
Hey, stop running away!

106
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,220
Ugh, C'mon, just
fight us already.

107
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,588
Hey, Nami, let's go!

108
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,689
Mm!

109
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,458
I'll see you guys when your
30 seconds are up, okay?

110
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,693
[ZORO thinking]
No! Don't leave us like this!

111
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,362
[SANJI thinking]
Nami, come back!

112
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,602
[USOPP]
Wait, what's that?

113
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,804
[NAMI] There's some
kinda note on the door.

114
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,407
[USOPP] Let's see. From
here on, it's a man's path.

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,108
No women allowed.

116
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,210
So, any clue what
that's all about?

117
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,280
Nope. Beats me but we'd
better stay on our toes.

118
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,384
Eh?

119
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,553
Is something the
matter, Doctor?

120
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,388
No, it's nothing.

121
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,694
That was about to get ugly.

122
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:10,364
For once, I agree with you.

123
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,298
[USOPP]
Huh...

124
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,534
It looks like a regular
old hallway to me.

125
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:19,373
Yeah.

126
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,509
[USOPP]
I take it back! This is weird!

127
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,378
What kind of place is this?!

128
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:27,147
Oh, I see. It's like a
holding cell under there.

129
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,515
These guys probably
did something bad

130
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,385
and got locked
away as punishment.

131
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,388
They can leer all they
want. I'm going ahead!

132
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,090
[USOPP]
Wait.

133
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,258
[PRISONER A]
It's a woman!

134
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,492
[PRISONER B]
All right!

135
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:43,097
[PRISONER C]
It's been so long!

136
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,133
I can't do it. I can't give
those creeps the satisfaction!

137
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,201
Leave it to me, Nami.

138
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,802
Huh? What are you?

139
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,404
Seems like they've been
locked up in the dark

140
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,439
for a while now and
if that's the case

141
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,275
they must be weak to light.

142
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,110
All I gotta do is bust
out one of my flash balls

143
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,812
and they'll be blind
as bats in no time.

144
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,748
And then we'll make
a break for it, huh?

145
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:05,051
Right, now close your eyes.
'Cause here it comes!

146
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,624
Okay, let's go!

147
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,058
You got it!

148
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,333
Help me!

149
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:19,833
[PRISONER D]
I got her!

150
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,201
Usopp, no!

151
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,035
My manhood!

152
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,136
[PRISONER E]
Let me touch her, too!

153
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,340
Don't worry! I'll never
forget your noble sacrifice!

154
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,641
[USOPP]
Don't leave me!

155
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,442
No!

156
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,142
[PRISONER B]
It's been too long!

157
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,811
[PRISONER F]
She's so soft!

158
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,479
Ah...!

159
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,148
Is something the
matter, Doctor?

160
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,016
No, it's nothing.

161
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,387
[NAMI panting]
Oh, that was a close one!

162
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:45,191
Huh? Another weird room.

163
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,261
[gasps]

164
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,330
[LUFFY]
Hey, Nami!

165
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,464
[NAMI]
Luffy?

166
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,599
Took you long enough!

167
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,666
What're you doing sitting down

168
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,601
in the middle of Foxy's ship?!

169
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,070
What am I doing?

170
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,372
I'm eating these rice
crackers and having some tea.

171
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,241
Well duh, I can
tell that much!

172
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,776
[FOXY] You've done
well to make it this far!

173
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,411
Congratulations!

174
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,746
But now that you're both here,

175
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,482
perhaps I should be
congratulating myself instead.

176
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,651
You see, it was my
plan to separate you two

177
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,419
from the rest of
the crew all along.

178
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,255
Luffy I get, but why me?

179
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,091
[FOXY] Because you're obviously
the brains of the operation!

180
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,659
With you and the captain
out of the picture,

181
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,828
the Straw Hats are
as good as done for!

182
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,230
I bet those other goons
will wipe themselves out

183
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,765
long before I get to them!

184
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,033
[LUFFY]
Mmm... That's a good plan...

185
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,336
This could be bad.

186
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,739
But hey for now
might as well fight!

187
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:32,773
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

188
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,610
Right on, brother!
That's what I like to hear!

189
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,413
[PORCHE] Oh yay! Does
this mean we'll finally get

190
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,648
our revenge on Straw Hat?

191
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:46,053
[NAMI]
What are those things?

192
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,655
[LUFFY] I've never
seen that one before,

193
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,323
but this one is
called Gorilla Pants.

194
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,426
[FOXY] Puncher! Not pants!
It's Gorilla Puncher 13!

195
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,461
Now get ready!

196
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,463
Here comes the Gorilla Punch!

197
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:58,065
Leave this one to me, Nami.

198
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:58,499
Right!

199
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,500
Now, Gum-Gum...

200
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,635
I wouldn't do that if
I were you, Rubber Boy.

201
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,737
Remember what happens
when you touch the gloves?

202
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,105
[LUFFY]
...Pistol!

203
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,174
[FOXY]
It burns.

204
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,175
Hot hot hot hot...

205
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,577
[FOXY]
You forgot, didn't you?!

206
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,144
Luffy!

207
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,748
[PORCHE]
You better not ignore me!

208
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,782
Cause if you do,

209
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,452
Mr. Donkey Kicker 18
is gonna stomp you silly!

210
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,090
[LUFFY]
Hey! Nami!

211
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,159
Water, water, water,
water, water, water!

212
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,794
Oh, I see! That's a good idea!

213
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,166
Wow, I knew you were pathetic,

214
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,268
but if you think you can
beat us with magic tricks,

215
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,102
you're just plain crazy!

216
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,042
All right here goes!

217
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:50,650
Today's forecast is rain!
Thunderstorm Tempo!

218
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,626
Nice try, but it's
gonna take more

219
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,495
than a little crappy weather to
bring down my Gorilla Puncher!

220
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,534
[FOXY] You really
are stupid, aren't you?

221
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,370
If this thing can take
punches and lightning,

222
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,572
you think a little rain
can make any difference?!

223
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,041
We won't know
until we try, right?

224
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,409
All right, have it your way.

225
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,211
Since you clearly don't
have any common sense,

226
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,280
I'll have to beat some into you!

227
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:22,750
Gorilla Punch Golden Hit!

228
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,618
Can't burn me now!

229
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,157
Somebody stop him, quick!

230
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,531
Now Gum-Gum...

231
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,235
...Spinning Top!

232
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,276
Hey, Boss? You're
not gonna hit us, right?

233
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,448
Holy smoke!

234
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,216
No!

235
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,290
What was that?!

236
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,531
Look, it's Boss!

237
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,333
Did he beat the Straw Hats?!

238
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,335
Men, I've returned!

239
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,704
[cheers]
Yeah!

240
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,574
I got beat.

241
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,276
[snickers]

242
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,616
See? Just like I said,
you took too long

243
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,351
and they finished
the fight without us.

244
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,754
The only reason we're
late is 'cause you got lost!

245
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,289
Hey, Rubber Boy!

246
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,291
I lost fair and square
to a fellow pirate,

247
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,592
so you won't hear me complain.

248
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,827
Skin me, turn me in,
or do whatever you want.

249
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,430
All right, then. In that case.

250
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,632
Why don't you let them
join your crew again?

251
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,466
Huh?

252
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,669
What?! But they
stole the Sexy Foxy

253
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,470
and stabbed me in the back!

254
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,141
Yeah, so?

255
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,277
I said I wouldn't complain,
so have it your way.

256
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,247
All right, men. Straw Hat
says you get a free pass,

257
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,349
so that's how it's gonna be!

258
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,685
Boss? You mean it?

259
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,586
[LUFFY]
Go ahead. Talk to them.

260
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,590
Thank you.

261
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:46,594
Straw Hat.

262
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:49,597
Listen up, frogs. If you
all wanna be foxes again,

263
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,432
then that's fine with me.

264
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,200
Awww, Boss!

265
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,769
Yeah!!

266
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,075
Well, he's got charisma,
if nothing else.

267
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,077
[FOXY WOMEN]
We love you, Boss!

268
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,812
Kinda makes me mad.

269
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,746
Boss!

270
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,282
You better not be
switching sides on me.

271
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,450
I was just kidding, my darling!

272
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,757
[FOXY] Bon voyage,
Straw Hat, take care!

273
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,125
You too, Split-Head!

274
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:21,695
So, funky!

275
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,063
Yeah!

276
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,464
[NAMI]
Oh no you don't.

277
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,503
Good! I thought
you'd never wake up!

278
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,706
Where am I? Last
I remember I was...

279
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,343
Hey! You left me
stranded with those creeps!

280
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,412
That's not what happened
at all! Did you forget?

281
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,786
Ohh... When you put it that
way, then it all makes sense.

282
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,621
I don't remember
beating up all those guys,

283
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,757
but I guess I am
pretty strong, huh?

284
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,524
Eh-heh heh...

285
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,397
Hey, Boss, now that we
have our old crew back

286
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,431
we're finally done dealing

287
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,234
with those horrible
Straw Hat Pirates, right?

288
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,802
Not a chance.

289
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,205
Didn't take long for Boss
to cook up another scheme!

290
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:09,476
No matter what it takes we
have to crush the Straw Hats!

291
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,677
Otherwise, we're gonna be stuck

292
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,547
with this stupid looking flag
for the rest of our lives!

293
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,650
That being said, I think
you know our destination.

294
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,285
Yeah!

295
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,287
[thinking]
I'm coming for you, Rubber Boy.

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,323
Feh-feh-feh!

297
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,328
Hey guys! I think
I see an island!

298
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,762
[NAMI]
Hmmmm...

299
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,098
Looks uninhabited to me.

300
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,535
Ready the anchor!
Let's go check it out!

301
00:15:34,568 --> 00:15:37,204
[SANJI] Find me some ingredients
and I'll start cooking lunch!

302
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,505
[CREW]
All right!

303
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,808
[NAMI] Listen, nothing
slimy or gross, okay?

304
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:41,809
[ZORO]
What does it matter?

305
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,144
Once it's in your stomach,
it's all the same.

306
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,179
Get over yourself.

307
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:45,779
[punch]

308
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,713
[ZORO]
Ow!

309
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,385
[LUFFY]
Hey! Sanji!

310
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,154
We got fish and fruit
and everything. It was easy!

311
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,689
Nice work!

312
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,290
[ALL]
Cheers!

313
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,594
Yummy!

314
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:03,163
It'd taste a lot better if
you didn't scarf it down!

315
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,566
I figured you wouldn't have
any room left for dinner,

316
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,301
since you finished off
all the snacks on the ship.

317
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,603
But I'm just getting warmed up!

318
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,670
[SANJI]
That's not good,

319
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:13,240
since we've decimated
half our supplies already.

320
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,508
[CHOPPER] Robin,
you better eat fast

321
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,110
before all the food is gone!

322
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,045
Just let me get to a
stopping point, first.

323
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,813
[CHOPPER] Okay, but I heard that
if you read too much you turn

324
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:24,217
into a yucky bug.
They call them book worms.

325
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,555
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

326
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,758
I found you Straw Hat!

327
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,427
You kids ready to
teach him a lesson?

328
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,329
You bet we are! Let's go!

329
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,630
Any time, Boss!

330
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,798
One, two, one two...

331
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,738
Hey, Boss, they're all
looking right this way.

332
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,240
What's the big deal?

333
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,541
Even if they do notice us,

334
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,677
they'll think we're
just an ordinary crab!

335
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,745
I hope they
don't try to eat us!

336
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,081
Is that who I think it is?

337
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,083
Who else would be that stupid?

338
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,085
Don't these guys have
anything better to do?

339
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,754
Okay while they're busy
eating, let's wreck their ship!

340
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,723
What's going on back there?!

341
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,560
I caught a crab! Let's eat it!

342
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,295
He's kidding, right?

343
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,332
Nope and I think he's about
to get a nasty surprise.

344
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,567
Stop! We're not food, you fool!

345
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,369
One, two, one, two!

346
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:18,072
Hey, come back! You look yummy!

347
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,607
Oh yeah? Then
take a bite of this!

348
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,447
[FOXY] Now's our chance!
Crab-Crab Punch!

349
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,015
The only thing you'll
be tasting is defeat!

350
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,020
Hey, now!

351
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:33,921
You better learn your place

352
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:35,689
if you know what's
good for you, crab!

353
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,524
Now open up!

354
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,327
'Cause I'm gonna eat you!

355
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,802
Wow, I can't believe you guys
got eaten by that big crab.

356
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,271
That's pretty lame!

357
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,206
Get that out of your mouth!

358
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,307
[SANJI]
Now that that's taken care of,

359
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,209
let's get back to our barbecue!

360
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,511
[LUFFY] All that crab-bashing
worked up my appetite.

361
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,446
[SANJI] Hey!
That isn't done cooking yet!

362
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,681
[LUFFY] Whatever.
Still tastes good to me!

363
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,389
C'mon, Boss,
I want barbecue too!

364
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,224
[FOXY]
Well, too bad!

365
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,660
We didn't come here to eat,
we came here to fight!

366
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:13,794
But don't worry.

367
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:17,398
Because soon we'll
taste victory--

368
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,600
Thank you for
waiting, Mademoiselle!

369
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:22,603
I hope that my barbecue
special is to your liking!

370
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:25,039
Oh! You bet!

371
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,507
Here you go. Help yourself!

372
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,445
This is positively scrumptious!

373
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,381
Why don't you come to
Boss' ship and be our cook?

374
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,749
[SANJI]
Oh no! Don't tempt me!

375
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,086
If you ask, I might
have to say yes!

376
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,622
Please, by all means.
Don't let me stop you.

377
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,490
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL rings]
Puru-puru-puru...

378
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,360
[FOXY CREW C] Hello, this
is the communications room.

379
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,797
Hi, it's me. Boss is knocked
out, so we're done here.

380
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,465
Come and get us, okay?

381
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,600
Mhmm, mhmm...

382
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,735
Don't worry.
Yeah, he'll be fine.

383
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,037
All right then,
see you in a sec.

384
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,441
Bye-bye Mr. Cook.

385
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,643
I'll never forget
your yummy barbecue!

386
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:04,245
It touched my heart!

387
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,047
Take care Porche,
I'll miss you!

388
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,383
Are you sure you don't
wanna go back with her?

389
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,353
No way! You may not
appreciate good food,

390
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:15,122
but Nami and Robin deserve
nothing less than the best!

391
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,057
Right, Nami?

392
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,661
C'mon guys! Let's go!

393
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,097
We still need to stock up
on some emergency supplies!

394
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,732
[SANJI]
Wait for me, Nami-swan!

395
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,508
Hey, Chopper, did you
find any new herbs to use?

396
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,677
Mhmm... This place has
all sorts of neat stuff.

397
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,678
I got a good stock,

398
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,214
but I'm still looking in
case I missed something.

399
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,148
Which reminds me,

400
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,284
I noticed something
weird a second ago.

401
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,586
There's a little groove
along the trail here.

402
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,254
I wonder what it is.

403
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,789
Oh, you're right. That is weird.

404
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:52,192
Looks like a bicycle or
something came through here.

405
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,161
[SANJI] C'mon, that
doesn't make any sense.

406
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,529
There's nobody
else on the island.

407
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,231
Why would there
be a bicycle?

408
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,267
[USOPP chuckles]
Yeah, that's a good point.

409
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,236
[LUFFY] Hey, check it out.
We're almost through the jungle!

410
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,706
[LUFFY]
Well, that's a letdown...

411
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,209
Just looks like a whole
lotta nothing out here...

412
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:10,243
Ah!

413
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,614
He's excited.
Did I miss something?

414
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:17,751
[ZORO] I don't get it either.
Maybe he found some new herbs.

415
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,821
[LUFFY] Huh?!
Chopper, you cheater!

416
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:22,556
You were gonna hog
that big mushroom

417
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,757
all to yourself, weren't you?!

418
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,059
Get back here!

419
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,126
Hahaha!

420
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,396
Hey! What happened?
Are you okay?!

421
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,764
There must be
something behind that rock.

422
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,532
C'mon! Hurry!

423
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,203
[CHOPPER] Whoa!
You're not a mushroom!

424
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,106
[snoress]

425
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,411
[AOKIJI] Hmm?
A raccoon dog?

426
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,214
Can't you see the antlers?!
I'm a reindeer!

427
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,117
[LUFFY]
I saw you fall. Are you hurt?

428
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,153
Who the heck is that?!

429
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:54,121
[ZORO]
What's going on?

430
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,090
I dunno someone's here.

431
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,158
[AOKIJI]
Do you mind? I was sleeping.

432
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,527
Did you hit my friend?!

433
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,529
Oh man that guy is huge!

434
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,698
I thought we were
alone on this island!

435
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:08,068
[gasps]

436
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:12,539
[CREW] Huh?

437
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,309
You know him?

438
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,111
Hey, is this guy an enemy?

439
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:18,512
Who is he?

440
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:21,482
If Robin's freaking
out, then so am I!

441
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,584
Something's wrong.

442
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,219
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

443
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:26,787
Look, I know you're
surprised to see me,

444
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,988
but don't get so worked up.

445
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,325
It's not like I came here on
official orders or anything.

446
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:34,361
It's a nice day, so
I decided to go for a ride.

447
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,331
Orders, huh?
And who is it you work for?

448
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,632
He's a marine.

449
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,167
Not only that,
he's known as one

450
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,537
of the World Government's
Ultimate Powerhouses.

451
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,239
Whoa, for real?!

452
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,707
[ROBIN]
I'm afraid so.

453
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,277
This is Admiral Aokiji
from Navy Headquarters.

454
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,815
My, my, you've grown into quiet
the lovely lady, haven't you?

455
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:57,551

♪ ending song ♪

457
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,262
[LUFFY]
So this guy's a big deal?

458
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:16,329
[ROBIN]
That's right.

459
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:18,399
There are only three
officers in all of the Navy

460
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,833
that hold the
position of Admiral.

461
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:20,834
They call them

462
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,603
the World Government's
Ultimate Powerhouses.

463
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:23,871
[AOKIJI] That pretty
much sums it up.

464
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,774
Anyway, I've been looking for
you for a long time, Nico Robin.

465
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,809
[LUFFY] Stop!
You leave her alone!

"Navy Headquarters
