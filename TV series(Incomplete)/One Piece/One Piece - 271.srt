1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,071
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,673
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,410
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,548
After being left behind
at the front gate,

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,550
Sniper King heard
a shocking story

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,587
from one of the
giant gatekeepers.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,290
But everything changed when
we visited a certain island.

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,128
They weren't
captured 50 years ago.

9
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,498
That's nothing
but a big fat lie!

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,699
On the other side of
the gate, the Straw Hats

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,769
were catching up to Luffy
thanks to Sodom and Gomorrah.

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,339
But just before they reached
the courthouse, tragedy struck.

13
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,310
We've been hit! No!

14
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,379
Sodom!

15
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,448
Grit those teeth
and hold on, Sodom!

16
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,516
You can't fall yet!

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,385
Guys, you're gonna have to jump!

18
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,320
Get off him, quick!

19
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,559
He's coming down!

20
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,729
Meanwhile, on top
of the courthouse,

21
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:05,198
Luffy and Blueno
were facing off.

22
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:09,636
So Robin is in that
building behind you, huh?

23
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,439
Outta my way, bull guy!

24
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,140
Listen boy.

25
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,510
Perhaps you
haven't realized this

26
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,512
but what you are doing right now

27
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,649
is nothing short of
a world-class crime.

28
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,584
Hm?

29
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,819
You will not only face
a merciless death,

30
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,056
but serve as an
example to the entire world.

31
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,791
Here we go!

32
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,127
Iron Body.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,761
Gum-Gum Rifle!

34
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,776
This doesn't make any sense!

35
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,679
He wasn't like this at all
when I fought him before!

36
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,613
How is it that he's
so much stronger now?

37
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,417
Gatling!

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,752
Shave!

39
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,680
All that matters is
getting Robin outta here!

40
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,050
All the forces are gathering
at the courthouse.

41
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:33,720
At long last, the battle
with CP9 has begun!

42
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,259
I see!

43
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,460
Meow!

44
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,530
My goodness, those pirates
sure are reckless, aren't they?

45
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,432
Hey Granny!
Hey Granny!

46
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,367
Meow! Meow!

47
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,338
Oh boy, now what?

48
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,173
Come see! Come see!

49
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,441
Meow!

50
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,094
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

51
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

52
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,783
It's coming.

53
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,751
Wait, aim carefully!

54
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,422
Get it in your sights, men!

55
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,091
It's a trench mortar.
Gomorrah! Dodge!

56
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,662
Damn bastards had an
ambush waiting for us.

57
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,065
Taking the main road
sure was a bad idea!

58
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,199
Turn around, quick!

59
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,046
Not so fast!

60
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,284
Sorry, Sodom.

61
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,219
Stop right there!

62
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,601
Chopper.

63
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,104
Puru-puru. Puru-puru.

64
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,372
Hm? Who could be calling?

65
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,107
Yes? Hello?

66
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,242
Howdy howdy!

67
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,377
Granny Kokoro!

68
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,245
What's going on?

69
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,248
All right, sounds
like you're still alive.

70
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,716
So, where are you?

71
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,486
We're almost at the courthouse,
but we're under attack.

72
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,754
Why do you ask?

73
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,589
Oh, perfect timing.

74
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,225
There's a little something
I forgot to tell you.

75
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,559
That doesn't sound reassuring.

76
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,262
Well, I'm sure you're busy,
so I'll make it quick.

77
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,463
Listen carefully.

78
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,399
If you remember
that map Paulie drew,

79
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,733
you might notice there's no path

80
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,102
from the courthouse to
the Gates of Justice.

81
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,406
That's been bothering me but
I was afraid to ask about it.

82
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,640
Look at the courthouse.

83
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,076
You see those
towers on either side?

84
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,077
Yeah, I see them.

85
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,479
All right, now there's
a lever on the top floor

86
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,814
of each of those towers.

87
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,684
If you folks can get in
there and pull both of 'em,

88
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,053
a drawbridge'll come
down from the courthouse

89
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,554
to the Gates of Justice.

90
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,655
Whoa!

91
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,691
But how do you know
about all that stuff, Granny?

92
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,261
I came here with Tom
ages ago to fix that bridge.

93
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,663
Damn stupid
ungrateful Government!

94
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,465
Don't take it out on me!

95
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,367
Chimney wants to talk, too.

96
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,235
Pirate lady.

97
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,604
Hey, can you hear me? Hello?

98
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,505
Yeah, I've got
you loud and clear!

99
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,573
Guess what?

100
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,508
I just saw your
rubber pirate buddy!

101
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,645
He was over on the rooftop
of the courthouse just now!

102
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,547
Meow! Meow!

103
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,748
So that's where he is!

104
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,285
There was a bunch of smoke
and broken stuff up there too,

105
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,420
so it looks like
he's wrecking the place!

106
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,421
Thanks!

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,190
Hopefully we'll get there soon.

108
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:40,094
And by the way, don't
hang up the transponder snail.

109
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,696
I'd like to keep track of
what's goin' on with you folks.

110
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,798
No problem. See ya!

111
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,202
Can't keep the captain
waiting. Right, men?

112
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,504
Gero! Gero!

113
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,405
Good.

114
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,673
You head straight
for the courthouse.

115
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,309
The sooner that your crew can
get back together, the better.

116
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,543
That's what I say.

117
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,146
Sounds good.

118
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,151
Meanwhile, we'll
split in two groups

119
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,286
and bring down the drawbridge.

120
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,557
You hear that, Gomorrah?
To the courthouse!

121
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,735
Gomorrah!

122
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,045
Damn. Who the hell is that?

123
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,134
Don't get too cocky, scumbags.

124
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:01,575
All right! The second
one's down, too!

125
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:03,744
How's that, huh?

126
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,713
Not so fast now, are ya?

127
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,214
Everybody, move in!

128
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,583
Attention, all Marine guards.

129
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:12,319
Here at Block D in
the southeast quadrant,

130
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,055
the pirate's King Bull
has been eliminated!

131
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,458
All units should
move in immediately.

132
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,760
Form a blockade
around the entire area.

133
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,761
I repeat!

134
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,598
All military personnel
surround Block D now!

135
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,502
Seems that the jurymen have
delivered the verdict for us.

136
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,271
And it's guilty as usual, huh?

137
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,342
Say something, man!

138
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,110
Yes sir.

139
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:38,044
On our way!

140
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,419
The marines we trampled over
are catching up to us again.

141
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:45,986
Not good.

142
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,688
And it's not just them.

143
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,256
We're surrounded here!

144
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,492
We've got trench
mortars aimed at us, too.

145
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,328
There's gotta be
like a million bajillion

146
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,063
of those guys out there!

147
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,265
We can't even run away anymore!

148
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,100
What're we gonna do?

149
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,316
What is this?

150
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:16,683
An earthquake?

151
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,391
Where did they come from?

152
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,525
Neato!

153
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,066
Hey.

154
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,133
Look!

155
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,305
All right.

156
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,440
Oimo and Kashii are
back on their feet!

157
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,642
We're screwed.

158
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,014
I don't have the strength to
fight these guys a second time.

159
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,319
We were so close!

160
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,558
Crush those criminals
into the ground!

161
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:01,094
Grind their little bones
between your toes, giants!

162
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,133
Pound 'em, Kashii!

163
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,068
Pulverize 'em, Oimo!

164
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:15,242
C'mon.

165
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,278
What're you big
lugs waiting for?

166
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,645
Make them pay!

167
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,755
You bastards.

168
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,524
How dare you?

169
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,397
Lie to us!

170
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,405
What the hell?

171
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,306
Don't tell me they betrayed us!

172
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,577
And now, with our bosses safe,

173
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,212
before we mourn all
those years we wasted--

174
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:57,051
We're going let out every
last ounce of our anger on you!

175
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,520
Are you ready,
King of the snipers?

176
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,163
Let us not waste words.

177
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,532
Hoist the signal for
the counterattack!

178
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,501
Soon we shall be
reunited with our comrades!

179
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,494
Damn, you got it good.

180
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,597
Not everyone gets
their own rescue squad.

181
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,065
Hey, keep it down!

182
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,201
Sorry!

183
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,102
Hmph.

184
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,370
Well, just sayin'.

185
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,506
It's not like I'm bitter 'cause
my men aren't coming to save me.

186
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:55,275
They got better
stuff to do, I'm sure.

187
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,827
Ah, that's right.

188
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,362
I almost forgot.

189
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:19,332
Before you leave, you
should take these with you.

190
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,204
Wait a sec!

191
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,773
Those are Devil
Fruits, aren't they?

192
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,311
Yoyoi.

193
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,045
My!

194
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,451
What a surprise!

195
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,687
Chapapa.

196
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,522
I've never seen
one in person before!

197
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,592
It's my first time as well!

198
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,292
Stay away!

199
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,761
Don't let those things near me!

200
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:48,729
You ate one, too.

201
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:49,697
What's your problem?

202
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,731
Why the fuss?

203
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:51,465
What?

204
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,599
Haven't you heard?

205
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,468
The reason they're called
"Devil Fruits" is because

206
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,769
the people who eat them

207
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,405
have a little devil living
inside their bodies!

208
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,573
Just think.

209
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,342
If I get too close
to one of those things,

210
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,210
the devil inside
me might pop out

211
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,579
and start fighting with
the devil inside the fruit.

212
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,380
If something like that happens,

213
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,682
my whole body'll
be blown to bits!

214
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,218
You're kidding me.

215
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,621
That's nonsense.

216
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,223
You're a member of an
intelligence agency

217
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,424
and you believe that?

218
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,792
What a shame.

219
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,295
The condition for the
transfer of devil fruit powers

220
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,397
has been confirmed by
scientists on the Grand Line

221
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,199
for quite some time.

222
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,368
The condition you're
talking about only happens

223
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,803
when someone
eats two Devil Fruits.

224
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,372
I don't know if
devils are involved,

225
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,207
but their bodies do burst apart.

226
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,475
The price for greed.

227
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:35,709
What fools.

228
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,545
If you think about the risk that
comes with eating one fruit,

229
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,581
you can only imagine
what kind of disaster

230
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,683
you might bring upon
yourself by eating two of them.

231
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:45,919
Huh.

232
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,788
So that's how it works. Still.

233
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:48,655
I'm surprised.

234
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,457
I can't believe
you got two of these.

235
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,092
Pretty impressive, Chief.

236
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,360
How'd you pull that one?

237
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,329
Let's just say
I have connections.

238
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,297
How's that?

239
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,565
At any rate, best of luck.

240
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,068
That's right, CP9!

241
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,604
Grow stronger and stronger!

242
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,173
As always, there is
a certain risk involved.

243
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,310
We don't know what kind of
devils reside in those fruits.

244
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:12,313
I've never seen a fruit like
this in any reference book.

245
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,815
You can feel a strange
power coming from them,

246
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,450
a heaviness in the air.

247
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,419
It's like they're
from a different world.

248
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:21,088
That's what everyone says.

249
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,489
I've been told that
you only learn the name

250
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,225
of the fruit once
you absorb its powers

251
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,228
but there's no guessing what
kind of ability you'll gain.

252
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,265
Well, there's no denying
that there's a risk involved.

253
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,067
The wrong power
could ruin your life.

254
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,702
And either way, you'll
no longer be able to swim.

255
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:40,307
It's not an issue of what power
you get, but how you use it.

256
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,576
No matter what,
you won't get weaker.

257
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,080
And as for being unable to
swim, it's hardly a problem.

258
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,181
It's a rare treasure.

259
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,316
Of the thousands
who search for them,

260
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,218
I'm sure most end up
empty-handed

261
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,154
or dead by the
end of their journey.

262
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,389
Just try it already.

263
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,192
It'll be interesting.

264
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,528
Don't do it. Are you crazy?
That thing's evil!

265
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,397
Also, they taste
like crap, I tell you.

266
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,331
Crap!

267
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,200
Yeah right. He's jealous.

268
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,636
He doesn't want them
getting stronger! Chapapa.

269
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:09,370
Shame.

270
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:13,173
You should know,
Jabra, that envy

271
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:17,544
and resentment
are a man's downfall!

272
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,047
Yoyoi!

273
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,249
Hey! Shut up!

274
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,450
C'mon. Just stop.

275
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,818
Think about this!

276
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,088
If you sell these things,
you could make millions.

277
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,122
But one bite

278
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,191
and you'll be cursed
for the rest of your life!

279
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,240
Chapapa.

280
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:49,009
Yep.

281
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,510
Interesting all right.

282
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,646
Here goes.

283
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,114
Hope it's good.

284
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,384
They ate them!

285
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,385
No!

286
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,054
Coo coo!

287
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,322
Coo cooloo coo!

288
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,722
Chapapa.

289
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,398
What's wrong?

290
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,633
Yoyoi.

291
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:17,471
Is your body besieged with
a strange metamorphosis?

292
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,539
Chapapa!

293
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,416
Gross.

294
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,484
Say so sooner!

295
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,552
It's really gross.

296
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:32,553
Yeah, we got that!

297
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:33,620
Chapapa!

298
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:38,292
And yet, you ate the
whole thing without a word!

299
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:41,061
Well? C'mon!
Try doing something already.

300
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,796
I wanna see what kind
of powers you got!

301
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,834
I don't feel as if
anything is different.

302
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:51,338
Soon you'll understand
the extent of your changes.

303
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,375
The birth of new Devil Fruit
users is always exciting.

304
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:58,679
Enjoy yourselves, but I'd try to
get those powers under control,

305
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:00,547
while you still can.

306
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,614
Depending on our orders,

307
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,752
you might have to use
them in real combat soon.

308
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,221
It seems Blueno couldn't wait.

309
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,156
We'll have to see if
he saves any fun for us.

310
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,582
You're not bad.

311
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:37,918
Not bad?

312
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,155
I never thought he'd be able to
keep up with the speed of Shave.

313
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,723
I'll have to watch that.

314
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:46,126
And since he's made of rubber,
direct attacks won't work.

315
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:50,664
Moon Walk!

316
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,602
Now, Gum-Gum--

317
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,002
Tempest Kick!

318
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,276
Iron Body!

319
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,680
Wheel!

320
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,124
Door-Door!

321
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,331
Was that a door on the ground?

322
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,432
Door-Door.

323
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,837
Whoa, wait a sec!

324
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,305
Now there's a bunch of little
ones all over the place, too!

325
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,475
Damn it, I can't move!

326
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,811
This sucks. It's a stupid trap!

327
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,413
You're the one doing this?

328
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,448
But how? A Devil Fruit?

329
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,184
The Door-Door Fruit, naturally.

330
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,419
A Door Man?

331
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,722
I turn all that
I touch into doors.

332
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,261
Revolving Door.

333
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,465
Whoa, what?

334
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,201
I'm not moving anywhere
but I'm spinning!

335
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,204
I dunno which way is the front!

336
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,739
Make it stop!

337
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,374
Tempest Kick!

338
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,089
Cook. See that?

339
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:23,257
Yeah. I saw.

340
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,425
You know what that means.

341
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,560
Luffy's already fighting CP9.

342
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:27,528
What?

343
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,195
Huh?

344
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:28,829
Seriously?

345
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:29,663
Damn it.

346
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,365
We're too late!

347
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,700
But there's nothing we can do!

348
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,201
We're totally surrounded.

349
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,136
And after taking
that last big hit,

350
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,139
I don't think Gomorrah's
going anywhere!

351
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,408
Everyone open fire and
shoot those pirates down

352
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,110
from the monster
before it gets back up!

353
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,551
Look. We gotta run.

354
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:51,785
We can't wait here any longer.

355
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:52,652
Yeah.

356
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,089
Let's cut through
to the courthouse.

357
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:57,624
It's our only option.

358
00:20:58,859 --> 00:20:59,526
Right! Let's go!

359
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,128
Are you ready?

360
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,496
Yeah!

361
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,134
Wait. Nobody get off!

362
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,735
What? Why?

363
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:15,175
Everyone, hold on tight!

364
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:35,396
That...
That's what Gomorrah says!

365
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,597
It's still alive!

366
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,265
The monster's getting back up!

367
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,300
Fire!

368
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,634
Stop it with the trench mortars!

369
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,703
Take that thing down!

370
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:45,505
Return fire! C'mon. Hurry!

371
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,148
Go, Gomorrah! Charge!

372
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,296
After hearing all
the field reports,

373
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:19,333
our guard casualties total
must be over 2,000 men!

374
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,801
Wait, not five?

375
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:24,138
In the history of this island,
this is, without a doubt,

376
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,339
the absolute worst thing

377
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,374
that has ever happened
at Enies Lobby!

378
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,277
What the hell's going on?

379
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,612
On the next One Piece:

380
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:34,614
"Almost to Luffy! Gather
at the Courthouse Plaza!"

381
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,284
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
