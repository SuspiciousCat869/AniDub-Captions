00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:43.106
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.949
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:40.822
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.504
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:51.744
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:53.648
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:55.919
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.952 --> 00:02:58.957
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.701
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:05.336
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.977
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.319
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.227
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.065
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.603
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:24.308
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:27.515
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.353
However, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:33.426
that offers the
Flame Flame Fruit as a prize.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.397
The first round
is a battle royale,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.470
from which only one competitor
can emerge victorious.

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:40.140
Burgess of the
Blackbeard Pirates

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.710
won the match for Block A,

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:44.582
and the battle for
Block B is about to begin.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:47.021
[GYATS] Gladiators led
by the tactician, Dagama

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:49.091
are protecting
Elizabello the Second,

00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:50.795
ruler of the
Kingdom of Prodence!

00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:52.866
The question isn't if, but when

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.204
will he throw his
devastating King Punch!

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:56.941
Who will be its target?

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:59.279
[ABDULLAH, JEET groan]

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:01.248
Make 'em bleed, Bellamy!

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.721
[GYATS]
So cruel! So vicious!

00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:05.390
Look these words up
in the dictionary

00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:08.130
and you'll surely find a
picture of this man's face!

00:04:08.163 --> 00:04:10.534
He's certainly one
of our top contenders,

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:11.737
but does he have any hope

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:14.509
of toppling
Elizabello and his allies?

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:15.612
[GILLY yells]

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.348
[GYATS]
On the other side of the stage,

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.553
a duel has erupted
between Jiaokungdo

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:21.155
martial artist, Blue Gilly,

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:23.594
and the mysterious
gladiator, Ricky!

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:26.132
Which of these bruisers will
emerge victorious?

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.638
[HACK]
Four Thousand Brick...

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:31.275
[BARTOLOMEO stammering]

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.179

[CROWD cheers, gasps]

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.830
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
Gotcha!

00:04:41.863 --> 00:04:44.368
[HACK groaning]

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:51.517
[GYATS] What's goin' on?! Why
is Hack the one on the ground?!

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.921
That's crazy. What's going on?

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:57.461
[GYATS] Who or what is
this lewd, crude contender?

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:00.300
Surely some kind of monster!

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.037
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:17.067
[CROWD gasping]

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.649
[BARTOLOMEO grunts, chuckles]

00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:27.923
[gasps]

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:29.960
[GYATS]
Hack is defeated!

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:31.162
[CROWD shouting]

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:35.303
[GYATS] It looked like he
didn't even get near him!

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:38.744
What did Bartolomeo
do just now?!

00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:41.249
Agh, no! I was rooting for Hack!

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:44.054
Someone put an end to that
obnoxious little jackass!

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:45.958
Aren't you supposed
to be impartial?

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:48.330
[ATTENDANT B]
Please calm down!

00:05:48.363 --> 00:05:51.102
[GYATS] Looks like it's
anybody's game at this point!

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:54.441
B-Block's down to 24
competitors!

00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.946
'Bout time to
wrap this thing up.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.419
Heh. Bet that guy'll
be fun to kill.

00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:02.024
[DAGAMA laughs, grunts]

00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:03.393
It's heating up!

00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:05.732
[DAGAMA] Here comes
the moment we planned for.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.501
Hi-yah!

00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:10.841
[GILLY shouting]

00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:12.210
[GILLY]
Hm?

00:06:12.243 --> 00:06:14.281
[GILLY yells]

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:16.853

[CROWD cheers]

00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:21.831
[GYATS] Even the most
accomplished fighters

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:23.433
are dropping like flies!

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.339
Not just Hack, but the
unknown gladiator, Ricky,

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:28.644
is down for the count as well!

00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:31.182
Blue Gilly is on a roll!

00:06:31.216 --> 00:06:32.418
[WOMAN A]
Blue Gilly!

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.822
[WOMAN B]
You're awesome!

00:06:34.856 --> 00:06:36.960
[GILLY] Did you really
think you could cut anything

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:40.400
with a dull blade
like that, old man?

00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:47.982
[DOLD] In the end, my old
age was what bested me.

00:06:48.015 --> 00:06:50.320
[CROWD cheering]

00:06:50.353 --> 00:06:53.493
[DOLD] I hate this
cheering for bloodshed.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:57.936
But even more so,
I hate you, Doflamingo!

[COMPETITORS grunting, groaning]

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:11.062
Dagama had the right idea, huh?

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:13.099
This competition is
really thinning out!

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.401
Oh, yeah.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.673
Most of the other
guys are long gone.

00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:20.380
[COMPETITOR G] I'm glad we
teamed up, or I would be, too!

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:22.450
[COMPETITOR H chuckles]
Same goes for me!

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:26.192
Wait for the cue from Dagama.
That means it's time to break!

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:27.528
Then we'll fight
amongst ourselves

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:29.900
until somebody wins,
you got that?

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:31.804
There's still a few
guys left standing,

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:34.041
so let's take out
as many as we can!

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:35.744
[COMPETITOR F chuckles]
Yeah, sounds good.

00:07:35.778 --> 00:07:36.547

[COMPETITOR M]
Blue Gilly!

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.735
Here I come!

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:48.905
Get ready! [groans]

[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:53.179
Here we go! Let's
eliminate Blue Gilly

00:07:53.212 --> 00:07:55.684
while we're all
still working together!

00:07:55.718 --> 00:08:00.394

[DAGAMA laughs]
Like a pack of dogs!

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.062
Loyal, but not too bright!

[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:19.933
What the--?

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.770
You were supposed
to give a signal!

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:24.408
You lied! Traitor!

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.946
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.021
[COMPETITOR X]
What?!

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:34.596
Heh. I'm sorry, fellas.
It's nothing personal.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.101
I'm just following
orders, same as you.

00:08:37.134 --> 00:08:39.070
Does that mean you
were in on this, too?!

00:08:39.104 --> 00:08:41.977
You were gonna use and get
rid of us from the very start!

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.282
[DAGAMA cackles]

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.485
And you're too greedy
for your own good!

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.258
Let's see if you live long
enough to collect your pay!

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:50.528
You're a monster!

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:56.606
Heh. Warriors who can't
think for themselves

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.944
end up doing someone
else's dirty work.

00:08:58.978 --> 00:09:01.516
I'll let you take care
of the rest, Longleg.

00:09:01.549 --> 00:09:02.552

But you've made a fatal mistake

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:08.897
in turning your
back to me, Blue Gilly.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.204
[DAGAMA] Come what may,
the Kingdom of Prodence

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:14.776
will take home the
Flame Flame Fruit!

Bye!

00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:26.366
[DAGAMA] How dare you
betray me, Blue Gilly?!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.739

[WOMAN C]
Go, Blue Gilly!

00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:39.626
[GILLY] Hm. That guy couldn't
have been any more suspicious.

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:42.731
I'm surprised anyone here
was willing to trust him.

00:09:46.873 --> 00:09:48.242
[GILLY]
Hmm.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.720
Hold on. What's happening now?

All right, Bellamy!

Looks like the crowd
favorite, Bellamy,

is getting ready to
fly into the fray!

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:05.142
He's targeting the winner of the

"most annoying pirate who
should just go away" contest,

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:11.255

Uh?

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:38.275
Bellamy's down?! But he's the
one who went in for the attack!

00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:41.850
How does Bartolomeo
keep doing this?!

00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:43.453
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:45.289
He beat him without even moving.

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:47.962
Just like what he
did to Hack earlier!

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:50.534
But how did he do that? Crazy!

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:51.737
[BELLAMY groans]

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.472
Tell me what you did.

Tell me, dammit!

00:11:57.534 --> 00:11:59.973
No! It can't be!

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:03.713
Sorry, folks, I think
Bellamy's done for!

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:06.686
[BELLAMY groans]
What was that?

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:09.224
What the hell kinda
Devil Fruit did you eat?

00:12:09.258 --> 00:12:11.763
[cackles]

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:13.867
[BELLAMY groans]

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.405
[MAN B]
Come on! Don't give up!

00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:19.713
[LUFFY]
Bellamy.

00:12:19.746 --> 00:12:22.552
I lost all of my
crewmates on that trip,

00:12:22.585 --> 00:12:26.693
but it turned my view of the
whole damned world upside-down.

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:30.133
There's a big wave that's about
to crash through this world,

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:34.140
and I think that Doflamingo's
ship can ride it out.

00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:38.850
Either way, I'm done
laughing at you.

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.690
[BELLAMY groans]

00:12:41.723 --> 00:12:45.129
You can do it!
Keep hangin' in there!

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.539
[ELIZABELLO grunting]

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:52.978
So, Elizabello,
what do you plan to do?

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:54.148
I mean, what good's a king

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.486
without any loyal
subjects to rule over?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.057
[ELIZABELLO grunting]

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.289
I mean, everyone in this arena

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:17.761
wants to be the
one to do you in.

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:19.766
And now, even the guys
who were guarding you

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.168
have turned their backs on you.

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.473
How does that
feel, "Your Majesty"?

00:13:23.507 --> 00:13:28.082
[ELIZABELLO grunting]

00:13:34.929 --> 00:13:36.264
[GILLY chuckles]

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:40.707
[ELIZABELLO grunting]

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:55.202
[GILLY] Hm? What's wrong,
can't strategize for yourself?

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:56.740
Some great ruler you are.

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:58.676
[ELIZABELLO chuckles]

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:12.738
Dagama served
his purpose well.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:15.209
My punch is
warmed up. [chuckles]

00:14:15.242 --> 00:14:17.281
All that's left is to throw it!

00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:18.249
[gasps]

00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:19.619
[ELIZABELLO]
Nothing is more dangerous

00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:21.656
than an unchecked weapon.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.696
That formation wasn't
protecting me from you.

00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:27.300
It was protecting you from me.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:31.074
Don't think so? Wait and see.

00:14:33.614 --> 00:14:36.686
Dude. I just thought
of something.

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:37.588
What is it?

00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:39.291
That's the King
of Prodence, right?

00:14:39.325 --> 00:14:41.395
I've heard about that guy.

00:14:41.428 --> 00:14:43.800
They said that he
destroyed an entire enemy fort

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.436
with a single punch.

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:46.773
Nah, that's crazy.

00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:48.977
I'm sure he had a
cannon or something.

00:14:49.011 --> 00:14:50.113
It's true!

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:52.116
Rumor has it, that
punch is powerful enough

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:53.853
to defeat one of
the Four Emperors!

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:55.256
[MAN H]
What?!

00:14:55.289 --> 00:14:57.360
[MAN I] My point is,
if that story's legit,

00:14:57.394 --> 00:14:59.665
then everybody on this
side of the colosseum's

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.970
gonna be blown
away by the impact!

00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:05.109
[MAN H] Huh? Come on, man,
nobody can punch that hard!

00:15:05.142 --> 00:15:08.015
I dunno, guys. I remember
hearing that story, too!

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:10.821
This is bad! If he
throws a punch like that,

00:15:10.854 --> 00:15:12.591
hundreds of people
will die for sure!

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.294
[COMPETITORS grunt]

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:20.272
The tension is palpable now!

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.344
After quietly keeping
that punch in reserve,

00:15:22.377 --> 00:15:24.815
it looks like the
king's ready to strike!

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:32.130
[ELIZABELLO grunts]
Mark my words,

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:36.071
I will win the Flame Flame Fruit
for the Kingdom of Prodence!

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.459
[FRANKY] Hey! What did
you wanna talk about?

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:05.129
What's your deal, man?

00:16:05.162 --> 00:16:07.500
Like I said, if I'm gonna
wreck the SMILE factory,

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:09.806
then first I'm gonna need to
shake down one of Doflamingo's--

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.174
[TOY SOLDIER]
Halt.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.849
[TOY SOLDIER]
Hmm.

00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.457
Now, what's up?

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.428
Listen, I ain't
got all day here.

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:23.800
If you wanna say
somethin', spit it out.

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:26.640
Sorry, but I'm way too busy
to stroll around with ya.

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:28.175
[TOY SOLDIER]
Hmm.

00:16:29.612 --> 00:16:33.653
I'd love to stay and
not chat, but later, pal.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.567
Tell me.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.802
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:44.174
It's just, you keep
going on and on

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:45.944
about this radical idea,

00:16:45.977 --> 00:16:48.850
but why would you want
to do something like that?

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.221
[FRANKY grunts]

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:53.125
[TOY SOLDIER] I get the feeling
you're aware of something

00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:56.098
that the other
people here don't know.

00:16:56.131 --> 00:16:57.535
So I demand to know what

00:16:57.568 --> 00:17:00.005
your true intentions
are in all of this!

00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:02.711
Like I said, I came here to--

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:03.980
[rumbling]

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:04.649
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:06.218
[CROWD gasping]

00:17:06.251 --> 00:17:07.621
[FRANKY]
Uhh?

00:17:09.057 --> 00:17:10.426
[FRANKY]
What's that?

00:17:19.077 --> 00:17:20.412
No!

00:17:31.836 --> 00:17:34.608
[ELIZABELLO grunting]

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:37.582

[ELIZABELLO growling]

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.094
Uh-oh.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:45.798
This does not look good.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.799
He's gonna do it!

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.371
Here it comes. We should run!

00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:50.073
Hurry!

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:55.149
[CROWD screaming]

00:17:55.183 --> 00:17:59.324
Maybe the rumors were true!
If so, we're in trouble!

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:07.106
Oh, wow, not givin' up, huh?

00:18:07.139 --> 00:18:09.044
Get your stupid
spring off of me!

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:11.716
[BELLAMY cackles]
You're about to find out

00:18:11.749 --> 00:18:13.452
you messed with the wrong guy!

00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:14.589
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:18:14.622 --> 00:18:15.223

[COMPETITOR JJ gasps]

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.013
[COMPETITOR JJ]
Now's my chance to kill him!

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:28.048
[GILLY]
Move it!

00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.286
Now, Shooting...

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.460
...Punch!

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:44.649
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

[CROWD whispering]

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.807
[MAN N]
Hey, look at the Colosseum!

00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:15.175
What just happened?

00:19:25.028 --> 00:19:26.866
[GYATS gasps]

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.907
[GYATS]
That-- That was incredible!

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:35.115
[GYATS] No one in the ring
could have survived that blow!

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:38.255
Elizabello has wiped out
all of his competition

00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:40.026
with a single punch!

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:43.265
Exactly like the stories said!

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.271
Yeah! Nice work!

00:19:46.304 --> 00:19:51.314

[ELIZABELLO grunts]

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.740
[LUFFY coughs]
Whoa!

00:20:03.773 --> 00:20:07.113
Wouldn't wanna be on the
wrong side of that punch!

00:20:07.146 --> 00:20:10.219
[GYATS] There you have it,
folks! Bellamy, Blue Gilly,

00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:13.459
and all the other fighters
have been eliminated!

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:17.233
Out of all 138
competitors in Block B,

00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:20.006
I hereby proclaim the
victor to be King Elizabe--

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:22.811
[MAN Q] Hey, look! There's
somebody still down there!

00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:23.580
[ELIZABELLO]
Hm?

00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.617
That means the fight's not over!

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.520
[GYATS gasps]

00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:29.858
[MAN D] Good thing he was facing
that side when he punched!

00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:31.762
We're all safe over here!

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.420
[cackles]

00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.030
It's a Barrier!

00:20:49.063 --> 00:20:50.065
[ELIZABELLO gasps]

00:20:50.098 --> 00:20:51.268
What's wrong,

00:20:51.301 --> 00:20:53.540
can't create a wall by crossing
your fingers like this?

00:20:53.573 --> 00:20:56.679
Come on, it's so easy
a little kid could do it!

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:04.528
Well, guess it could be 'cause
I ate the Bari Bari Fruit.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.070
Barrier Crash!

00:21:10.073 --> 00:21:13.546
[ELIZABELLO groans]

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:26.639
[GYATS screams]

00:21:26.673 --> 00:21:31.414
The Fighting King Elizabello
is out of the running!

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:34.220
That means Block
B's winner is...

00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:37.060
[growls] Dammit all!

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:39.632
Bartolomeo!

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.469
[laughing] Now, that
that's out of the way,

00:21:42.504 --> 00:21:44.942
the rest of you can
go to hell, too!

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:46.946
[CROWD yelling]

00:21:48.415 --> 00:21:49.885
[MAN E]
Screw you, dude!

00:21:49.918 --> 00:21:52.056
[MAN F]
Yeah, buzz off!

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:58.836
[LUFFY] No way, the winner
was that weird chicken dude?

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:04.313
[BARTOLOMEO cackles]

00:22:04.347 --> 00:22:08.589
The Flame Flame Fruit's mine.
And soon, I can give it to you!

00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:16.171
[FRANKY]
Huh? You, too?

00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.810
Lower your voice!
Somebody could hear you!

00:22:18.843 --> 00:22:21.114
[FRANKY grunts]

00:22:21.148 --> 00:22:24.622
So you're tellin' me you want
to destroy the SMILE factory?

00:22:24.655 --> 00:22:25.857
[TOY SOLDIER]
Correct!

00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.028
My comrades and I have
been making preparations

00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:29.665
to do just that!

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.604
Then tell me where it is!

00:22:32.637 --> 00:22:34.642
I'll tear that factory
down in no time!

00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.077
You can't do that!

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.515
Yeah, why not?

00:22:37.548 --> 00:22:40.152
If you do, then it'll
be too late for us

00:22:40.186 --> 00:22:42.524
to rescue all of
the factory workers!

00:22:42.558 --> 00:22:44.829
Oh, you're plannin' to
get everyone out first?

00:22:44.862 --> 00:22:46.265
[TOY SOLDIER]
Yes!

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.968
It's a risky mission.

00:22:48.002 --> 00:22:51.843
The fate of this country depends
on whether or not we succeed!

00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:54.414
My friend, if you truly have
enough courage

00:22:54.447 --> 00:22:56.952
to stand against Doflamingo,

00:22:56.986 --> 00:23:01.294
then first let me tell you
the sad history of Dressrosa!

00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:02.597
[FRANKY grunts]

00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:05.269
[TOY SOLDIER]
Hm.

00:23:14.956 --> 00:23:17.193
[NARRATOR] Law's team
crosses a strange bridge

00:23:17.226 --> 00:23:19.799
on the way to Green Bit
to hand over Caesar.

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:21.669
They soon realize
that the structure

00:23:21.703 --> 00:23:24.007
is far more perilous
than they thought.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.278
Just when it seems
like all hope is lost,

00:23:26.311 --> 00:23:29.651
Law pulls off a miraculous
surprise move!

00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:31.354
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:35.496
"The Fighting Fish Strike!
Across the Deadly Iron Bridge!"

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.201
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
