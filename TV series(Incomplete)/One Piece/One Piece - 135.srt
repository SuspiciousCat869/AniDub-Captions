I'm a doctor!

177
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,177
Is there a place nearby
where we can stabilize him?

178
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,946
[GOAT A bleats]

179
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,950
[GOATS bleating]

180
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,455
Oh, dear.

181
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,058
I very well almost
lost my life out there.

182
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,960
Should have known better
than to drop my guard

183
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,128
around you pirates.

184
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,896
Oh, come on!
It wasn't our fault!

185
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,064
You fainted on your own.

186
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,033
Your heart stopped because
you were shocked to see us,

187
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:27,967
old goat guy?

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,169
On the Grand Line,
you encounter surprises

189
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,138
stranger than us every day.

190
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,205
With that weak ticker of yours,

191
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,308
I'm surprised you've lasted
as long as you have,

192
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,475
Old Timer.

193
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,977
Yeah, I'll say!

194
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,579
[NAMI] We're just happy
that Chopper was able

195
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,147
to resuscitate you.

196
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,215
What's there to be
happy about, missy?!

197
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,051
You scared the hell out of me.

198
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,919
Not to mention
almost got me killed.

199
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,255
Now I'm laid up and can't
chop wood or do my chores.

200
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,856
You scalawags owe me!

201
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,091
Now let's see here.

202
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,860
About 50 million
Berries to be exact!

203
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,863
[NAMI] Hey. You're
overcharging, aren't you?

204
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,166
At the most,
it should be this much.

205
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,400
You're being stingy!

206
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,836
Even with a discount,
it's closer to this.

207
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,406
But minus Chopper's
consultation fee, it's this.

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,542
[ZENNY] Where do you
young folk get off ganging up

209
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,211
and picking on
an old man like me?

210
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,113
It ain't right, I tell ya!

211
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,348
[NAMI]
We're not picking on you!

212
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,050
[ZENNY sobs]
I can't go on anymore!

213
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,452
[NAMI]
Please don't cry.

214
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,420
Don't get upset, old goat guy.

215
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,022
Tell ya what:
we'll chop your wood

216
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,958
and do your chores
for you, okay?

217
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,526
You're the reasonable sort,
aren't you,

218
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,528
my straw‐hatted lad?

219
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,030
It's a deal then!

220
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,466
[chuckling]

221
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,936
[SANJI] Wow, that old guy
sure seems to have a dislike

222
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,404
for pirates, doesn't he?

223
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,873
I wonder why he's got
such a grudge against us.

224
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,408
The goats said that
he's the only person

225
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,544
on the island and he has
been for the last 20 years.

226
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,279
That's when he first
washed ashore here

227
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,447
from somewhere else.

228
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,950
Twenty years?

229
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,052
We've met someone
like that before, right?

230
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,921
[LUFFY]
Where are you going, Zoro?

231
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,223
Zoro? Zoro?

232
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,291
[ZORO] What? I'm gonna
find something to eat.

233
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,960
Even if that old man
does have food,

234
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,495
I doubt that he'll
share it with us.

235
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,462
[LUFFY]
Oh, cool!

236
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,965
In that case, bring
back some meat, 'kay?

237
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,167
[ZORO] I'll try, but don't
get your hopes up!

238
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,570
[ZENNY]
You call that wood‐chopping?

239
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,172
Put your back into it more!

240
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,607
What's with you
youngsters today?

241
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,242
Can't you even chop wood right?

242
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,410
My word!

243
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,416
You call this clean?
What a joke!

244
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,917
Clean it right this time!

245
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,019
You! Fetch me some grass
and feed the goats!

246
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,621
And you! Go patch up my roof!

247
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,089
‐‐[USOPP] Yes, sir!
‐‐[LUFFY] Yes, sir!

248
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,624
I'm so tired.

249
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,125
Well, don't just stand there!

250
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,960
Get over here and
rub my shoulders!

251
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,530
Can't you kids figure out
anything for yourselves?

252
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,265
Do I have to point out
all the other things

253
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,434
that need to be
done around here?

254
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,935
Oh, no, there's more?

255
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:43,969
[ZENNY]
Yep.

256
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,875
Damn!

257
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,111
They must of switched north
and south on this island!

258
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,547
Where am I?

259
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,950
Is that...?

260
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,924
A ship.

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,075
[hammering]

262
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,243
[USOPP]
Get in there, nail!

263
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,344
[LUFFY]
It's lit.

264
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,015
I finally made it back.

265
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,584
You guys are still doing chores?

266
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,685
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

267
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,386
That old guy's been
working us to death all day!

268
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,554
He's never letting up!

269
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,124
Yeah, we're all worn out.

270
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,358
And hungry, too.

271
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,597
[LUFFY]
A pirate ship?

272
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,032
I know it sounds crazy,
but there's one up there.

273
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,134
I know what I saw.

274
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,568
I wonder who coulda made it.

275
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,537
Well, the old guy's
the only one here.

276
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,272
[USOPP] But why would
that miserable old kook

277
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,406
build a pirate ship?

278
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,208
[SANJI]
How should I know?

279
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,378
I think I might know why,
and we're in luck if I'm right.

280
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,045
[GROUP]
Huh?

281
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,214
Anyway, let's check it out.

282
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,049
Just up there, right, Zoro?

283
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,217
[chuckles]

284
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,051
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

285
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,053
[USOPP]
I'm beat. Do we have to run?

286
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,222
[ZORO] Hey, wait,
it's farther than it looks!

287
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,326
[LUFFY]
It wasn't that far.

288
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,561
[ZORO]
Damn!

289
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,430
It was this close all this time
and I didn't even know it?

290
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,133
[SANJI] It seems kinda
creepy if you ask me.

291
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,270
[ROBIN] Yes, like sighting a
ghost ship on a dark night.

292
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,738
Robin, don't say that!

293
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,644
‐‐Whoa, what are those?
‐‐[USOPP yells]

294
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,779
Vengeful spirits from
the dead, what do you think?

295
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,748
They're fireflies, gah.

296
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,456
He used lumber made
from the local trees.

297
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,759
It looks like he stopped
building halfway through.

298
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,495
The old guy did
all this by himself?

299
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,630
Well, it doesn't
look like it's here.

300
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,532
[LUFFY]
What's not here, Nami?

301
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,100
The treasure.

302
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,268
What treasure?

303
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,703
The one that old man has.

304
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,272
He's not just a hermit,
I'm sure of it.

305
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,308
If I'm right,
he's a former pirate!

306
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,543
[GROUP]
A pirate? Him?

307
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,512
[NAMI] His ship was probably
smashed to pieces

308
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,448
by those reefs we saw and
he was the only survivor.

309
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,483
He's been building this ship
to get off the island,

310
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,320
but since he's alone,
it's taken years to complete it.

311
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,855
Hey, wait,
if he really is a pirate,

312
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,790
then why does he
dislike them so much?

313
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,458
That just doesn't
make any sense.

314
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,727
It does if he's only
acting like that to keep us

315
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,230
from finding the treasure
he's hidden somewhere.

316
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,465
I knew there was something
shady about that old guy

317
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,800
right from the start.

318
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,370
What confirmed it for me
was the furniture I saw

319
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,905
back in his hut.

320
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,141
He had some pretty valuable
things for a poor hermit.

321
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,377
You're beautiful and astute!

322
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,678
Get real, guys!

323
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,714
There's no way that old
dude could be a pirate!

324
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,349
Come on, he fainted!

325
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,384
I didn't say he
was a pirate now.

326
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,386
I said I bet he was
a long time ago!

327
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,655
Why else would
he build this ship?

328
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,591
There's a dense forest
ahead with no paths.

329
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,592
[GROUP]
Hm?

330
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,728
[ROBIN] Plus, there's a
steep cliff to the rear.

331
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,865
If he's going to build
a boat to escape,

332
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,668
why do it all the way up
here in the mountains?

333
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,737
[GROUP]
Yeah, how come, Nami?

334
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,206
Um, I don't know.

335
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,685
[CAPTAIN]
A danger zone?

336
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,688
That's the reason
you turned back?

337
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,957
Marines are supposed to
be made of sterner stuff,

338
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,593
not to mention bringing
fugitives to justice!

339
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,194
I apologize, Captain.

340
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,796
But that zone will
delay the Straw Hats

341
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,866
and probably damage their ship,
making them easier to catch.

342
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,536
[CAPTAIN] For your sake,
I hope you're right, Minchy.

343
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,705
The Straw Hat Pirates
have managed to elude

344
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,241
the likes of Captain Smoker
and Captain Hina,

345
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,976
leader of the Black Cage Unit.

346
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,712
But they won't escape us!

suddenly become nice."

00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,243
<i>until I recalled...</i>

521
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,814
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

522
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,718
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

523
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:12,858
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...♪</i>

524
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,165
[ZORO] How long are we gonna
keep looking after the old man?

525
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,167
[ROBIN]
My, how cold.

526
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,869
[ZORO] Whether he's a
pirate or has treasure,

527
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,670
it's none of our
business, right?

528
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,539
[ROBIN] Why don't you have
a more inquisitive mind

529
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,673
about this?

530
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,841
[ZORO] Well, it's just that
those Marines are gonna

531
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,876
find us here!

532
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,743
[ROBIN]
So you're scared?

533
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,745
[ZORO]
I'm done talking with you, lady!

534
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,247
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

535
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,181
"How's Tricks?

536
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,583
The Designs of Zenny
the Moneylender!"

537
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,052
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
