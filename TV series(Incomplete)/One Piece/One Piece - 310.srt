1
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,359
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:42,229
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,532
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:50,503
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,506
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,607
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,177
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,446
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,816
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,053
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,322
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,494
You're all going to die!

13
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,163
You morons can't
challenge the entire world

14
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,631
and expect to win!

15
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,601
So long as that woman is
wanted by the World Government,

16
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,336
I'll chase her forever!

17
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,305
I want to live!

18
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,678
Jet...

19
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:35,749
...Gatling!

20
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,221
Luffy!

21
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,555
Luffy!

22
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,726
[MARINE 309L]
Whoa! Look at the tower!

23
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,531
Attention aboard all ships.

24
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,734
I have an urgent report!

25
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,736
[MARINE 309G]
Just now, Rob Lucci,

26
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,105
the most powerful agent of CP9,

27
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,441
was seen lying face-down and
lifeless near the first column.

28
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,411
I repeat--Rob Lucci
has just been defeated

29
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,613
by Straw Hat Luffy!

30
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,352
Yes!

31
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:54,060
It's over.
We should be okay now.

32
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:03,070
We're all going back together!

33
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,274
Robin!

34
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,753
[chuckles]

35
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,225
[LUFFY] From the Sea,
A Friend Arrives!

36
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,261
The Straw Hats
Share the Strongest Bond!

37
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,366
[MARINE 310B] What?

38
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,235
No way. Impossible!

39
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,203
But he was CP9!

40
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,471
And the agents they have now

41
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,607
are the strongest
the world has ever seen!

42
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,676
[MARINE 310B] Even among them,
Rob Lucci was the best!

43
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,345
These pirates are too powerful!

44
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,634
[USOPP]
He won! Luffy won!

45
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,330
Luffy. You had us worried.

46
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:39,133
You finally beat him.
Way to go!

47
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,367
Luffy!

48
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,505
Everybody head
to the escape ship!

49
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,240
We're getting out of here!

50
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,408
[GONBE]
Meow!

51
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,675
He did it!

52
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,781
[ZAMBAI] Way to go, Straw Hat!

53
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,118
[PAULIE] You morons!
Keep it down!

54
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,386
Everyone can hear us!

55
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,189
[ZAMBAI] Who cares?
We want him to know!

56
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,325
Hey! Those voices!
Whose are they?

57
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,126
Unknown!

58
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:05,926
They're coming
in from somewhere

59
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,828
through a
transponder snail, sir!

60
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,530
[ZAMBAI] All right, Big Bro!

61
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,372
[USOPP] What?

62
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,706
That voice...

63
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,750
[PAULIE] Stop it!

64
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,088
They still think
we're dead, remember?

65
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,556
You're gonna blow it!

66
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,656
[FRANKY] It's them.

67
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,125
They made it.

68
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,298
Aren't those the
pirates we shot down

69
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,267
on the shore
by the front gate?

70
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,568
It sounds like it.

71
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,169
But sir, we saw 'em.

72
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,038
They all fell
over the cliff, sir!

73
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,739
They couldn't have survived!

74
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,318
Big Bro!

75
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,222
[yelling]

76
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:38,451
[gasping]

77
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,490
[FRANKY FAMILY 310A]
Stop pushing, you idiot!

78
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,093
[FRANKY FAMILY 310B]
We're gonna fall!

79
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,461
[FRANKY FAMILY 310C]
The rope's gonna break!

80
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,562
[PAULIE] You morons!

81
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,399
Galley-La ropes
never break! Calm down!

82
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:55,336
Jeez. I told you
to keep it quiet!

83
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,403
[ZAMBAI] We're all okay!

84
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,605
Everybody made it!

85
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,572
[KIWI] That was close!

86
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,473
The giants...

87
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,742
They took all the
cannon fire for us!

88
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,576
Gero!

89
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,412
Gosh. They're a
stubborn bunch, huh?

90
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,347
Uh-huh!

91
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,215
But hey, at least they're alive!

92
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,516
Meow!

93
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,152
[MOZU] Sodom and Gomorrah
are okay, too!

94
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,687
That's great!

95
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,456
Look. It's not safe here.

96
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,524
Those battleships
will be coming back.

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,826
We need to get moving now!

98
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:19,793
Right! Listen up!

99
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,196
We've got our escape
plan all figured out.

100
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,064
Go! Don't worry about us!

101
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,466
Let's all leave
this place alive!

102
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,700
See you again soon!

103
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,669
Time to head out!

104
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,405
[KASHII] Move it!
You guys climb up first!

105
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,108
Hurry up!
Blood rushing to head.

106
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,543
Getting dizzy...

107
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,412
[PAULIE]
All right. Climb!

108
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,313
[FRANKY FAMILY] Yeah!

109
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,181
[KIWI] Come on, everybody!
Get moving!

110
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,049
[MOZU] I'm gonna fall!

111
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:42,716
[YOKOZUNA] Gero!

112
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,351
[LULU] Stop shoving!

113
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,688
You dummies!

114
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:53,260
I wasn't worried
about you at all!

115
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,062
They made it! They're alive!

116
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,132
I'm so happy
those idiots are okay!

117
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,402
[sobbing]

118
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,369
[ZORO] Agreed.

119
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,038
Good for them.

120
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:06,073
What a relief, huh?

121
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,341
But if you die here,
it won't matter.

122
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,211
Yeah, you're right.

123
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:15,049
Sir! Should we hurry
over to the main gate?

124
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,283
No. Later.

125
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,285
First things first.

126
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,186
What's wrong?

127
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,423
Move it! We've got
a duty to carry out!

128
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,456
[MARINES] Sir!

129
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,663
Ha! Bring it on!

130
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,464
I'll take all of ya out!

131
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,735
Thunderbolt Tempo!

132
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:40,207
[ZORO] Tiger Trap!

133
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,309
Oni Giri!

134
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,643
Phoenix!

135
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,618
All right! Cien Fleurs!

136
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,494
Our target is Straw Hat.

137
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,829
He's on the first column!

138
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,664
[MARINE 310G]
Right! Understood, sir!

139
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,698
But he's--

140
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,402
[MARINE 310G]
He doesn't seem to be moving!

141
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,137
Straw Hat Luffy is--

142
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,306
Sir, he--He appears
to be severely wounded!

143
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,643
[ZORO] What?

144
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,768
[USOPP] Luffy!

145
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,336
What are you doing?

146
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,772
Hurry up and get
the hell over here!

147
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,173
If we don't escape,
we're all gonna die!

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,615
What's wrong with you, dammit?

149
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,517
We're almost there!

150
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,219
Use your powers to
slingshot yourself over here!

151
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,521
I'll carry you
the rest of the way!

152
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,496
[USOPP] We're surrounded by sea
and battleships on all sides!

153
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,099
If we stay here,
we're going to be killed!

154
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,834
It seems the pirates
plan to escape

155
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,136
using the stolen escort ship.

156
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,304
[MOMONGA] Hm.

157
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:20,473
[USOPP] Luffy!

158
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,316
[USOPP] Luffy!

159
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,352
Answer me! Say something!

160
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,590
I--I can't--

161
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,729
My body won't--

162
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,762
What?

163
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,304
My body won't move.

164
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,606
It won't move?

165
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,608
Come on, don't be stupid!

166
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,710
You just beat Lucci,
didn't you?

167
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,712
[USOPP] And we
already saved Robin!

168
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,248
The only thing
left to do is run!

169
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,351
Try harder!
You can do it!

170
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,192
[NAMI] Usopp!

171
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,562
Let's take the ship to Luffy!

172
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,431
We'll grab him
and get outta here!

173
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,434
Everyone, move! Get onboard!

174
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,601
Fire!

175
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,516
No! That's our escape ship!

176
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,156
Those bastards!

177
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,591
Now it's hopeless!

178
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:44,758
We're completely surrounded!

179
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,493
That ship was our
only way outta here!

180
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,194
What are we gonna do?

181
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:58,238
Kokoro! Chimney! Gonbe! Chopper!

182
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,496
No. What now?

183
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,041
[yelling]

184
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,786
[SANJI] We made it!

185
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,187
Outta the way!

186
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,555
[NAMI] Thank goodness!

187
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,198
Sanji!

188
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,433
What the heck happened?

189
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,234
And where have you been?

190
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,570
Sorry.

191
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,672
There was something
I had to take care of.

192
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,509
Damn, this is bad.

193
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,210
We're pretty screwed right now.

194
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,112
I never thought
they'd attack us

195
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,747
as long as we
still had Robin here.

196
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,349
I was sure the bridge and
the ship would be safe--

197
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:18,819
That's far enough!

198
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:19,853
Surrender!

199
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,388
Release the old lady
and the little girl, or--

200
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,657
There's no time for any of that!

201
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,393
Mermaid Kick!

202
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,599
Fire.

203
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,806
[screaming]

204
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,741
[NAMI] Why does this
always happen to us?

205
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,110
[ONIGUMO] Corner them
at the second column!

206
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,144
Fire!

207
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,349
[SANJI] That was close!

208
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:50,083
Keep moving!

209
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:52,485
Fire.

210
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:02,562
[screaming]

211
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,368
[SANJI] Run!

212
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,762
[SANJI] Dammit!
They took out the bridge!

213
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,530
We're stuck on this column!

214
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,565
These bastards
have got us cornered!

215
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,700
[ZORO] There's
nothing else we can do!

216
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,767
We're surrounded!

217
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,670
[NAMI] Then this is
where we'll make our stand!

218
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:43,604
Let's fight!

219
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:44,538
[FRANKY] Don't be stupid!

220
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:45,806
They'll just keep
sending more and more

221
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,441
of those Captains at us!

222
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,375
[ONIGUMO] All ships!

223
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,378
Prepare to open fire
on the first column!

224
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,560
All cannons take aim!

225
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,795
Eliminate Straw Hat Luffy!

226
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,738
[USOPP] Luffy!

227
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,186
[ZORO] Luffy's in trouble!

228
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,787
We gotta do something!

229
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,090
Crap. This is bad.

230
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,158
[USOPP] Luffy!

231
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:39,760
No good.

232
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,796
At this distance,
all I can do is grab him

233
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,798
and throw him into the sea.

234
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,535
Bad news, you guys.

235
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,337
Straw Hat may have
won the fight,

236
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,274
but now, he's so
weak he can't get up!

237
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,342
He'll be killed!

238
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,310
[PAULIE] Straw Hat!

239
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,811
[FRANKY FAMILY]
No! Straw Hat!

240
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,047
[YOKOZUNA] Gero! Gero!

241
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,182
[FRANKY FAMILY]
Stand up, Straw Hat!

242
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,286
Come on! Stand up!

243
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,687
Pirate guy! Run!

244
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,655
Meow!

245
00:18:07,688 --> 00:18:09,623
Luffy! Hurry!

246
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,557
Move it!

247
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,524
Dammit!

248
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,394
You've gotta do
something right now, Luffy!

249
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:14,595
[NAMI] Luffy!

250
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,462
[FRANKY] Straw Hat!

251
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:19,199
[FRANKY FAMILY]
Come on! You can do it!

252
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,435
[PAULIE] Straw Hat!

253
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,638
Gero! Gero!

254
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,574
No... I'm in trouble.

255
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,347
Luffy!

256
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,315
Get moving!

257
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,483
They're gonna kill you!

258
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,517
[KIWI and MOZU] Straw Hat!

259
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,486
[PAULIE] Get on your
feet and get outta there!

260
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,487
Now!

261
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,656
[FRANKY FAMILY]
Do something!

262
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,331
[USOPP] There it is again!

263
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,364
[USOPP] What?

264
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,702
Hey! You trying
to kill yourself?

265
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,070
Stop spacing out!

266
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,371
Now's not the time!

267
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,573
[USOPP]
Who's voice is this, anyway?

268
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,043
[USOPP] That's right!

269
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,445
It's the same voice
that I heard before!

270
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,723
What's going on here?

271
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,491
[PAULIE] Don't die on us!

272
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,158
What?

273
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,060
Those voices? It's my guys!

274
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:20,927
No!

275
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:22,496
That's not what
I'm talking about here!

276
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,164
I've heard it for a while.

277
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,198
Huh?

278
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,279
What?

279
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,617
Look below?

280
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,298
It's coming from over here.

281
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:58,431
"Below"?

282
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,173
[NAMI] Who's that?

283
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,508
What the hell? That voice.

284
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,282
It says "Look below!"

285
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:15,949
[CHIMNEY] Who does?

286
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,751
What are you talking about?

287
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,286
[MARINE 310T]
All ships, open fire

288
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,488
on the first column
and Straw Hat Luffy.

289
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,589
Commencing in five.

290
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:26,026
--[NAMI] No! Luffy!
-- [FRANKY FAMILY] Straw Hat!

291
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,232
[USOPP] You shouldn't have.

292
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,634
You really shouldn't have.

293
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,146
Jump in the sea!

294
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,648
[MARINE 310T] Four!

295
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,517
The sea!

296
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,752
[ZORO] Usopp?

297
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:52,686
Robin!

298
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,622
Can you still throw
Luffy into the sea?

299
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
Leave it to me!

300
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,624
[ZORO]
Are you trying to kill us?

301
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,557
What--

302
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,262
[ZORO] Jumping into the sea
won't help a damn thing!

303
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,696
[MARINE 310T] Three!

304
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,531
[USOPP] We're gonna be saved!

305
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,467
She came to rescue us!

306
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,269
Jump! It'll be okay!

307
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:10,804
We've still got
one more friend here!

308
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,273
[MARINE 310T] Two!

309
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,173
Chopper!

310
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,042
Did you see?

311
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:16,076
Yes!

312
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,048
Now. Cien Fleurs!

313
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,523
[MARINE 310T] One!

314
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:31,124
[ROBIN] Delphinium!

315
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,561
[LUFFY] I'm moving!

316
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,396
Is Robin doing this?

317
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,534
To the sea!

318
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,236
To the sea!

319
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,604
To the sea!

320
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:52,079
[USOPP]
Jump! Follow Luffy!

321
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,582
[NAMI and SANJI] Go!

322
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:57,651
[ZORO, CHOPPER, FRANKY]
Go!

323
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,120
[KOKORO, CHIMNEY, ROBIN]
To the sea!

324
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:02,723
All of the pirates are
jumping into the sea!

325
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:03,957
Ha!

326
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,793
There's no way those idiots
will survive in these waters!

327
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,294
They're done for!

328
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,629
[MARINE 310K]
Those Straw Hats are completely

329
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,397
out of their minds!

330
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,079
[VOICE]
Let's go back, everyone!

331
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:36,323
[MARINE 310T] Fire!

332
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:46,766
[VOICE] Back to
the seas of adventure!

333
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,038
[USOPP] Everyone!

334
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:54,574
Get on board the Merry!

335
00:22:57,177 --> 00:23:00,614
Merry!

336
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,584
[MERRY]
I came to get you!

337
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,664
[ROBIN] Before now,
I have always been alone.

338
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,300
I never thought that
those words Saul said to me

339
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,235
would ever come true.

340
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,203
True friends.

341
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,639
I want to thank you all
from the bottom of my heart

342
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,574
for saving me.

343
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,375
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

344
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,411
Everyone Makes a Great Escape!

345
00:23:30,444 --> 00:23:33,180
The Road to Victory
is for the Pirates!

346
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,649
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
