1
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:11,324
Shiryu! What's going on?

2
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,695
What happened at Impel Down?

3
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,498
I have a hunch that
Magellan didn't release you.

4
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,001
How did you make
it to Marineford?

5
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,506
[SHIRYU chuckles]

6
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,812
[SENGOKU growls]

7
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,081
[SHIRYU] Well, old friend,
maybe you ought to worry

8
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,249
less about how we
got here and worry

9
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:39,920
more about what you're
going to do now that we are.

10
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:43,290
[laughing]

11
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,825
[SHIRYU]
If you wanna find out more,

12
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:48,428
check out Impel Down later.
That'll give you an idea.

13
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,632
By the way, I'm switching sides,
in case you couldn't tell.

14
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,934
Figured you might
wanna know that.

15
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,272
[MARINE A]
Fleet Admiral Sengoku!

16
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,740
[SENGOKU]
Huh?

17
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,809
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to inform you sooner, sir!

18
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:06,246
We received a report

19
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,482
that the Gates of Justice
opened a second time,

20
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:12,086
and an unidentified ship
was able to pass through!

21
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,254
So, that's how they made it.

22
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,157
But the control room
is under Navy operation.

23
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,661
Nothing else unusual
was reported, either.

24
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,463
So, how could you slip
past us undetected?

25
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,933
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
That's where I'll take credit.

26
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,002
Huh?

27
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,437
[LAFITTE]
Allow me to explain.

28
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,540
Rapscallions that we are, we
crashed the party at Impel Down

29
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,076
and picked up your old friend.

30
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,110
Then I thought I'd
have a spot of fun and

31
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,980
hypnotize the Navy soldiers
in the control room.

32
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,715
I made them open
the Gates of Justice

33
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,984
for any Navy ship
that approached.

34
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,687
[LAFITTE] Incidentally,
that seems to have helped

35
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,922
a few other rogues
get through as well.

36
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,992
Straw Hat and his allies.

37
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,328
And since I was
considered a Navy ally,

38
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,796
I got through just fine.

39
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,397
If it weren't for my title,

40
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,067
I couldn't have made it
inside the prison, either.

41
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,236
Long story short,
bein' a Warlord

42
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,838
made this little
operation a cinch!

43
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,374
But now I'm through with you!

44
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,143
[SENGOKU growls]

45
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:13,013
[SENGOKU] You used us, just to
bolster the ranks of your crew?

46
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:17,684
[BLACKBEARD laughs] The old
soldier finally figured it out!

47
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,454
My plan is almost complete now!

48
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,756
You'll see soon enough.

49
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,863
[SENGOKU growls]

50
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:37,971
[BLACKBEARD chuckles]

51
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,374
Let's finish this,
you damned traitor.

52
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,344
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

53
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,645
[MARINES gasp]

54
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,918
Teach!

55
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:59,359
[MARINES screaming]

56
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,694
[LAFITTE]
Captain, incoming!

57
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,962
[BLACKBEARD grunts]

58
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:04,998
[BLACKBEARD yelling]

59
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:29,823
[PIZARRO]
Meow that was close!

60
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,425
Good to see our reflexes
are still in order!

61
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,935
[BLACKBEARD grunts]

62
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,775
So much for old times.

63
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,843
Guess I can't blame you.

64
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,013
[WHITEBEARD] Of all the
pirates who have called

65
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:54,714
the Moby Dick their home,

66
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,720
you're the only one I refuse
to call my son, Teach.

67
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,090
There is only one
rule I have on my ship,

68
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,459
and you dared to break it.

69
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,962
You betrayed our trust by
killing your fellow mate!

70
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,331
It's time to put an end to this!

71
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,000
You'll pay for Fourth Division

72
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,802
Commander Thatch's
death with your life!

73
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,738
Mark my words,
he will be avenged!

74
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,775
Pops, what're you doing?

75
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,244
[PIRATE F gasps]

76
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,478
[WHITEBEARD]
Marco!

77
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,616
Let me help you!

78
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:33,954
[WHITEBEARD]
Listen.

79
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,557
You stay out of this one, boy!

80
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,625
[MARCO]
But you're hurt!

81
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,760
[WHITEBEARD]
Did you hear me?

82
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,202
Let's get this
over with! Right now!

83
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,704
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

84
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:53,039
What do you think I'm here for?

85
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,614
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

86
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,953
[BLACKBEARD grunting]

87
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:09,356
Uh-oh. What's that black stuff
coming out of his body?

88
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,391
[MARINE C]
Is that... smoke?

89
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,628
[BLACKBEARD grunts]

90
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:29,976
Enjoy this Black Hole!

91
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,553
[BLACKBEARD laughs]

92
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,723
This Devil Fruit power's
exactly why I killed Thatch!

93
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,025
I knew I had to have it!

94
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,495
Dark Dark Fruit's real tasty!

95
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,530
Why don't you give it a try?

96
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,299
Don't worry, there's
plenty to go around!

97
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,203
[WHITEBEARD]
Hm? Hmm?

98
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,874
Y'know, there's a pattern.

99
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:05,346
First, Thatch kicks the bucket,
and now has Ace followed suit.

100
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,282
All your top underlings
seem to be dropping like flies,

101
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,751
and you're too old to
do a damn thing about it!

102
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,053
Good thing I'm no longer
under your thumb.

103
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,487
If I hadn't gotten
out when I did,

104
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,724
who knows where
I would've ended up!

105
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,092
And I'll have you
know I spared him

106
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,895
at Banaro Island when
I could've killed him.

107
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,667
I will not stand for this.

108
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,903
Easy now. Don't even bother.

109
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,772
Your power won't
work against me,

110
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,241
no Devil Fruit Power will!

111
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:38,044
[WHITEBEARD growling]

112
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:43,617
Vortex!

113
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:46,721
[WHITEBEARD]
Hm?

114
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,989
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

115
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,025
This darkness of mine
is pretty handy, ain't it?

116
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,261
I can nullify your
fancy little tricks,

117
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,763
just like I did
with good old Ace!

118
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,034
In other words,
no more earthquakes,

119
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,003
not against me!

120
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:04,071
[WHITEBEARD groans]

121
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,238
[MARCO gasps]

122
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,308
What just happened?
Nobody can hit Pops that easily!

123
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,479
[WHITEBEARD groans]

124
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,482
No, ya don't!

00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:16,750
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

126
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,523
Didn't you hear
what I just said?

127
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,762
[BLACKBEARD] You're not
gonna hit me with that!

128
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,897
[BLACKBEARD cackles]

129
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,467
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

130
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,368
[BLACKBEARD]
Stubborn old man!

131
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,873
[BLACKBEARD] C'mon,
don't be such a sore loser!

132
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,110

Oww. Damn! My arm!

[BLACKBEARD grunting]

136
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,527
You're arrogant... A fool.

137
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,463
You were never
fit to be in my crew!

138
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,469
Hey, hold on!

139
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,172
Pops, please don't!

140
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,474
I'm your son, Pops! Stop it!

141
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,275
You wouldn't kill your own son.

142
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,011

00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,262
[PIRATE AA]
He did it!

145
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,030
Way to go, Pops!

146
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,533
Huh?

147
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,769
Hey, look! He's still alive!

148
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,504

Huh?

150
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,879
[PIRATE BB]
All right!

151
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,615
Looks like he's still
got some fight in him!

152
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:55,983
[PIRATE CC]
One more hit ought to do it!

153
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,285
Come on, Pops!

154
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,786
[PIRATE DD]
Just one more!

155
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,922
[PIRATE EE]
Finish him off!

156
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,057

Come on, Pops!

00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,140
Hey, Pops! What's goin' on?

160
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,545
He isn't budging.

161
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,681

[PIRATES gasping]

163
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,856
He's taken on a lot
of damage today.

164
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:36,856
[PIRATE B, PIRATE C]
Huh?

165
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,193
[MARCO] On top of his
worsening health...

166
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,397
[MARCO] ...all this fighting
is starting to take its toll!

167
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,803
Pops's is still strong,
but his body is...

Wha...?

171
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:14,294
G-Get away from me, you monster!

172
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,368
I said get away from me!

173
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,669
Damn it!

174
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:25,272
Will you just die already?

[gasps] No, don't do it!

179
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:43,456
Finish him off! Hurry!

180
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,956
[grunting]

181
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,526
[yells]

182
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:33,840
[BLACKBEARD cackling]

183
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:43,550
[PIRATES]
Pops!

184
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,570
[BLACKBEARD laughs]
That's right!

185
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,739
Keep shooting him
till he's dead!

186
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,080
[ATMOS, CURIEL]
Fight back, Pops!

187
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,548
[BOTH]
Come on, Pops!

188
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,816
[SQUARD, PIRATE D, PIRATE E]
Please don't die!

189
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,058
[WHITEBEARD]
What do you mean, Roger?

190
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,027
You're going to die?

191
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:30,363
Yeah. I can just feel it.

192
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,836
Do you want to know
how to get to Raftel?

193
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,806
I could tell you, if you'd like.

194
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,609
[WHITEBEARD] Don't bother. I've
got no interest in that place.

195
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,181
Those World Government clowns
don't know what they're doing.

196
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,117
Do you know what they've
been calling me these days?

197
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:54,555
They call me "Gold Roger."

198
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:56,356
[WHITEBEARD]
Hmm? So what?

199
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,791
I thought that was your name.

200
00:15:57,825 --> 00:15:59,392
You wanna go by
something else now?

201
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,929
No, no, you don't get it!

202
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,732
My real name is "Gol D. Roger."

203
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,867
Every now and then,

204
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,737
I come across someone
with a "D" in their name.

205
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,611
Like my crew member,
Marshall D. Teach.

206
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,615
So, what does
the "D" stand for?

207
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:26,620
That you wanna know, huh?

208
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:32,893
Hah! Fine, fine. I can tell ya.

209
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,498
[GOLD ROGER] It's a story
from way back when...

210
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:44,104
[gunshots]

211
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,140
[BLACKBEARD]
Hey, I'm outta bullets!

212
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,308
Someone give me another gun!

213
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,578
[SHIRYU]
That won't be necessary.

214
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:53,847
Whitebeard's unconscious.
The man's done for.

215
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,248
You could nudge him
with your pinkie

216
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,851
and he'd topple
over like a domino.

217
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,187
[WHITEBEARD]
It's not you, Teach.

218
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,054
[gasps]

219
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,456
No way. He's still alive!

220
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,963
The man that Gol D. Roger
was waiting for,

221
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:14,167
it's not you, Teach.
Not a damn chance.

222
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,202
Hah?

223
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,072
Just as there are
people out there

224
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,674
who inherited Roger's will,

225
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:26,446
soon enough, someone will carry
on in Ace's name as well.

226
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:30,618
[WHITEBEARD] You may try
to destroy their spirit,

227
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:34,087
but you will never
extinguish their flame!

228
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,825
So it has been, and so
it shall continue to be,

229
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,994
from now till the
very end of time!

230
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:46,634
And one day in the future,
when we're all dead and gone,

231
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:49,703
someone will arise,
carrying generations upon

232
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:53,340
generations of our
history on his shoulders,

233
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,108
and he'll throw
down the gauntlet

234
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,079
in front of the entire world!

235
00:17:58,112 --> 00:18:00,080
Sengoku!

236
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:03,784
You and the Government
know what's coming--

237
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:07,855
a war that will embroil
the seas far and wide!

238
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:10,123
That's why you're so afraid,

239
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:13,894
though nothing you
do will stop it!

240
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,796
[SENGOKU grunts]

241
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:19,333
I've no interest in it myself,

242
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:24,338
but someday, that treasure will
turn this world upside down.

243
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:27,742
You know what I'm talking about,

244
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,511
and I'm sure that
someone will find it.

245
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,678
[gasps]

246
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:35,482
Whether you like it or not,
that day will come soon.

247
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,318
[chuckles]

248
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,854
[SENGOKU gasps, growls]

249
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,528
The One Piece!

250
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:51,231
The One Piece is real!

251
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,442
You bastard!

252
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,180
[laughs]

253
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:10,317
Now that was a
touching conclusion!

254
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:11,584
[ATMOS, CURIEL]
Come on, Pops!

255
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,787
[IZO, JILL, KINGDEW]
Don't leave us!

256
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:14,922
It's over.

257
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:18,258
[SQUARD, PIRATES crying]

258
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,264
[WHITEBEARD]
Forgive me, my sons.

259
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:29,903
I raised a fool and
I couldn't take responsibility,

260
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,205
but you boys gave me everything

261
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:35,108
I could have ever
wanted out of life.

262
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:41,848
[WHITEBEARD] I've reached
the end of my voyage.

263
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:57,230
[WHITEBEARD] It's been
a long and fulfilling journey.

264
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,338
[WHITEBEARD]
Let's sail out!

265
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,952
I couldn't have asked for more.

266
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:20,020
[PIRATE G] You don't
even care about treasure?

267
00:20:20,054 --> 00:20:22,389
Why else would
you be in the game?

268
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:26,059
Well, fine! What are
you looking for then?

269
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:30,564
Hey! You listening, Newgate?

270
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,900
There's only one thing I need,

271
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,469
and I've wanted it
since I was a kid.

272
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:39,506
Huh, I thought so!
Spill the beans!

273
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,610
[PIRATES]
Huh?

274
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,316
I want a family.

275
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:54,188
[PIRATE G] "A family"?
That's a joke, right?

276
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:55,956
[PIRATES laughing]

277
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,793
[WHITEBEARD]
I am deeply grateful.

278
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,198
[WHITEBEARD]
Goodbye, my sons.

279
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:22,883
[BLACKBEARD gasping]

280
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:29,356
Farewell.

281
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,965
[PIRATES crying]

282
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:46,072
He's... dead.

283
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:52,046
I can't believe that bastard.
He just died on his feet!

284
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,116
[NARRATOR]
And so, Whitebeard passes.

285
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,758
[inaudible]

286
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:16,670
[NARRATOR] Even after death,
his body remains upright.

287
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,139
The haunting image
of his battered body,

288
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:24,377
which mowed down his enemies,
was a sight to behold!

289
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,319
[NARRATOR]
The final tally of sword wounds

290
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:37,090
he received in this battle
was no less than 267!

291
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:41,895
The number of
gunshot wounds: 152!

292
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:46,199
He was struck by
cannon balls 46 times.

293
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:50,203
[NARRATOR] And yet,
if you were to look upon

294
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:54,341
the proud back of this
great man, you would see

295
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:59,446
that in this battle, and indeed
his entire life as a pirate,

296
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,950
it remained unmarred by
any sign of retreat.

297
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:15,896
[NARRATOR] Not content with the
deaths of Ace and Whitebeard,

298
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,399
the Navy seeks to
wipeout every last pirate,

299
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,800
even as they retreat.

300
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,370
In the midst of the fray,
Akainu sets his eyes on

301
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:23,770
the unconscious Luffy.

302
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:26,440
Meanwhile, Blackbeard
reveals his true scheme

303
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,475
and a terrifying new power.

304
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,143
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

305
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,814
"The Show Begins!
Blackbeard's Plot is Revealed!"

306
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,216
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
