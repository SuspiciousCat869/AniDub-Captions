1
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,644
To think that you left the
friends you traveled here

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,680
with all the way from the
East Blue for your ship!

3
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,518
Why in the world are the
three of you crying about it?

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,087
What?! We're not
crying, you idiot!

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,423
I was just thinking about
everything you've been through

6
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,559
to protect that ship all
alone and it touched my heart!

7
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,196
We're not crying!
None of us are crying! Really!

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,698
What the heck is
wrong with these nitwits?

9
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,769
Anyway, you get
the gist of it, right?

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,304
We're no longer friends!

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:40,407
The Straw Hats are
part of my past now!

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,575
It's so sad.

13
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,078
So sad that I'll
have to sing about it!

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,481
This song is called "Severed
Friendship! North Wind Chop!"

15
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,483
Yeah! Sing it, bro!

16
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,085
Hey! Are you
making fun of me!?

17
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,621
Bro!

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
Help me.

19
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:07,734
I'll say hello to your "bro"
for you when we pay him a visit.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,309
We now know the location.

21
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:16,610
Let's go.

22
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,637
Hey, mister! I made some tea.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,772
Why don't you take a
little break and have some?

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,609
Yeah? Thanks, I appreciate it!

25
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,144
I'll have some as soon as
I finish repairing this spot.

26
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,623
Ow! Ouch!

27
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,063
Hey! Gotta question
for you, brother.

28
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,200
I'll just get
right to the point.

29
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,070
What are you gonna do
after you fix that ship?

30
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,239
Uh... Well, let's see.

31
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,674
First, we'll go on a
few adventures together,

32
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,809
and eventually I'll sail her

33
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,144
back to our home
in the East Blue.

34
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:27,147
I know we didn't sail
around the world or anything.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,683
But the Merry and I made it
all the way to the Grand Line!

36
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,318
I'd call that a
successful voyage

37
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,254
that will end with
a triumphant return!

38
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,221
So, with our heads held high--

39
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,091
Nope. Sorry, not gonna happen.

40
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,493
You can't go all the
way back to the East Blue.

41
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,428
It's too far away.

42
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,602
What do you mean?

43
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,538
I took a close
look at your ship

44
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,407
when we were bringing
it up here earlier.

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,609
Got to see her from every angle.

46
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,711
Stop it, you bastards!

47
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,546
What are you planning
on doing with the Merry?

48
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,516
Take off those ropes!
Put her down!

49
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,485
If you do anything
to hurt this ship,

50
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,187
my 8,000 men will
make you regret it!

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,656
You hear me, Bikini Man?!

52
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,457
You are pissing
off the wrong guy!

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,593
You dismantling
piece of garbage!

54
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,361
You'll rue the day
you made an enemy of

55
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,065
the great and powerful
Captain Usopp! Rue the day!

56
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,533
Oh, shut up already!

57
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,201
Don't pinch me, square head!

58
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:21,735
You're gonna regret--

59
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:22,703
I said keep it down!

60
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,204
Ow, ow, OWW!!

61
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,273
Okay, okay! I'm sorry!
Stop that! It hurts!

62
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,142
I'm so sorry!
Please forgive me!

63
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,413
That ship is at
the end of her life.

64
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,449
Galley-La's
assessment was correct.

65
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,618
As an expert in the
demolition business,

66
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,587
I suggest you dismantle her.

67
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,323
What? That's ridiculous!

68
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:46,327
I'll even help you do the job.
Like I said, I'm an expert.

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,394
Are you crazy?

70
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,564
What in the hell are you
talking about, you jerk?!

71
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,635
Hold on! Don't come any
closer! Stop! I mean it!

72
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,070
Bro!

73
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,304
Take it easy!

74
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,573
I'm simply offering to help
demolish this ship, that's all.

75
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,308
Stop screwing around!

76
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,811
I'm not gonna let you
anywhere near her, understand?!

77
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,713
Get lost!
The Merry is my ship!

78
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,617
You're wrong. Listen.

79
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,552
That old girl's no
longer a ship.

80
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,589
What'd you say?

81
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,058
Earlier, I asked you a question.

82
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,195
About what you planned on
doing once you fixed that ship.

83
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,396
Now if you had said that

84
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,797
you were going to
cast away your life

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,333
to the sea and go down
along with her, then.

86
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,103
Well, I wouldn't have had
anything to say about it.

87
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,170
No questions.

88
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:34,308
But since you just told
me that you plan on going

89
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,277
all the way back to
the East Blue with her.

90
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,480
Well. Now I have
to stop you, brother.

91
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,718
That ship is at her end.

92
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,389
She won't even make it
to the next island. Listen.

93
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,158
A ship is born with one promise.

94
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,194
"To carry you across the sea
from one shore to another."

95
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:58,632
That's her sole purpose.
The reason for her existence.

96
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,135
Which means, when the time comes

97
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:04,104
that a ship can no longer
carry you across the sea.

98
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,177
Hey! Stop! No!

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,379
Then that promise
has been broken,

100
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,584
and she's no longer a ship!

101
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,184
Bro!

102
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:28,161
No! Stop it!

103
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,731
You bastard! Keep
away from the Merry!

104
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,078
Son of a bitch!

105
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,315
If you don't understand...

106
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,325
Then take a look with
your own damn eyes!

107
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,657
Sorry, Merry.

108
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,130
Don't worry.

109
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,533
I'll fix you up
right away. Every time.

110
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:45,105
As many times as you
need. No matter what.

111
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,376
I'll always take care
of you! Always!

112
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,149
Hey!

113
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,784
Enough already, Long Nose!

114
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,153
You saw the bottom
of the ship, right?!

115
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,155
The keel is broken
right down the middle!

116
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,124
The outer panels are slipping
off, and the frame is shot!

117
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,328
With a hull like that, the
first wave would rip her apart!

118
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,064
And you think that a
complete amateur like you

119
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,798
can just grab a hammer and--

120
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,109
You shut your damn mouth!

121
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,612
I don't wanna hear
another word out of you!

122
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:28,048
If you so much as breathe,
I'll kick your teeth in!

123
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,316
You hear me?!

124
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:59,079
Besides, I already knew.

125
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,783
Huh? What'd you say?

126
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:09,689
To be honest. In my heart.

127
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,061
I knew it all along.

128
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,433
I knew!

129
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,440
I knew the truth!

130
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,075
I knew that the Merry
was at the end of her life!

131
00:13:55,135 --> 00:14:00,407
Deep down, I... I knew it.

132
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,147
When I heard the assessment.
I knew that what I saw

133
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,450
on that day back in
Skypia really happened.

134
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:16,790
At first, I thought
I was dreaming.

135
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,160
That there was no
way it could be real.

136
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:24,765
On one foggy night in
a forest lit with nothing

137
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,800
but moonlight I heard

138
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,303
the hammering strikes
of a wooden mallet.

139
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:32,373
It sounded like it was coming
from the direction of the ship

140
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:36,543
but at the time there shouldn't
have been anybody on board.

141
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,113
I crept closer and

142
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,616
confirmed the sound was
indeed coming from the Merry.

143
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,186
The fog was thick but
I'm sure I saw someone there

144
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,555
striking away
with a wooden mallet.

145
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,691
I... I couldn't
figure out who it was.

146
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:55,629
Whoa! Check it out!
This is amazing!

147
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,830
On the morning of the next day.

148
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:01,068
We awoke to find the ship
had been haphazardly repaired.

149
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,205
Even the broken mast was
back where it had always been.

150
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,374
But there was something
even more peculiar

151
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,077
that was bugging me.

152
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,379
Whoever fixed the Merry
knew how she used to look.

153
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,215
Despite all of the
modifications we'd made to her,

154
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,784
this mysterious person

155
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:19,186
had brought her back
to her original shape.

156
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,788
She was still in
rough condition,

157
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:25,626
but she was the same old
Merry she had been before.

158
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,761
The whole situation
remained a mystery.

159
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,565
But for some reason, these
words lingered in my heart.

160
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,500
I don't know if it's
something I actually heard

161
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,070
someone say or maybe
just something I'd imagined.

162
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,240
Don't worry.

163
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,179
I'll carry everyone
for a little bit longer.

164
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:52,119
I know it sounds
ridiculous but I...

165
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:56,523
I think it was an
incarnation of the Merry.

166
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,092
And she spoke to me.

167
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,467
She probably already knew
that she was at her limits.

168
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,170
And so she appeared
in that form to tell us.

169
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,742
She wanted to reassure
us that it'd be all right.

170
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,143
That's what I thought of

171
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,645
when I heard her
assessment from Galley-La.

172
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,785
You think I'm completely
out of my mind, don't you?

173
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,520
I don't care-- You don't
have to believe me.

174
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,625
What is it, Bro?

175
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,494
Whether I believe it or not.

176
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,363
You said that
whoever it was you saw

177
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,366
looked like someone holding
a wooden mallet, right?

178
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,804
That's right.
Does it mean something?

179
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:48,809
Yeah, it sure does. It means
that you saw a Klabautermann.

180
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,111
Kla... Klabau-what?

181
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,548
A Klabautermann.

182
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,585
It's an old legend that's passed
down from sailor to sailor.

183
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,154
It's a very particular
type of fairy.

184
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,090
It only dwells on ships
treated with great care.

185
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,259
You could say it's
the ship's spirit.

186
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,297
It's said that it carries a
wooden mallet in its hand

187
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,232
and wears a sailor's raincoat.

188
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,368
At times when the
vessel is in danger,

189
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,504
it will run around the ship and
find some way to warn everyone.

190
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,474
I've heard that they help
sailors in other ways, too.

191
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:24,111
but, to be honest, this is the
first time I've ever heard

192
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,446
someone say outright
that they've seen one.

193
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,750
The more care a ship receives,

194
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:33,120
the more they grow to
appreciate the sailors.

195
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,722
This ship must've
been determined

196
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:38,626
to make sure you made it to
the next shore, no matter what.

197
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,294
Just think about it.

198
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,430
This ship had a caring crew
that was so special to her.

199
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,333
She even appeared in
human form to reassure them

200
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,135
that everything was
going to be all right.

201
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,404
I bet she's been very happy.

202
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,377
Merry?

203
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:07,688
I see. So, it was you.

204
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,523
You were the one
who made those repairs

205
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:15,128
and spoke to me back then,
weren't you? Merry.

206
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,342
As amazing as that is,
I'm still confused.

207
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,279
Tell me. Why would you have
a big fight with your crew

208
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,748
when you knew the
ship was done for?

209
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,720
It's not that simple.

210
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,357
I'll never understand
why men are so stupid!

211
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,492
Or such idiots!

212
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:56,303
Sounds like
someone's at the door.

213
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,337
"Someone"?

214
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,273
Who else would it be
but Zambai and the others?

215
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,577
But why would they
take the long way

216
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,346
and come in from the sea side?

217
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,314
Yeah, that's odd.

218
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,683
They normally come in
through the upper entrance.

219
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,354
Maybe they had to because they
were able to capture Straw Hat?

220
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,689
That's right! I forgot!

221
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:19,093
I kidnapped you to use you
as bait to lure out your crew!

222
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:20,060
They won't come.

223
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:22,229
I'm no longer a part
of that crew, remember?

224
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,397
That plan won't work.

225
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,507
Why are they ringing the
bell when they can just come in?

226
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,345
How annoying. Okay, okay!
Hold on, I'm coming!

227
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,648
Enough, already!
We hear you! Hold on a second!

228
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,488
All right, brother. Listen.

229
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:52,693
I think what you should do
is go back to your friends.

230
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,428
It's impossible to do that now.

231
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,064
I challenged the captain
to a duel for starters.

232
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,066
And then there's
the matter of the ship

233
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,100
that hasn't been settled yet.

234
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,504
What do you mean
"hasn't been settled"?

235
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:07,207
If your ship can't sail anymore,
then it can't sail anymore.

236
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,242
That's the end of it, right?

237
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,249
Just leave her
here with me, okay?

238
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,551
I'll take care of her in a
way that you'd approve of.

239
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,618
Problem solved.

240
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,088
I wasn't thinking about
what I was doing earlier.

241
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,090
I tried to dismantle the
ship without considering

242
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:24,158
what would be best for you.

243
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,125
It'll be different this time!

244
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,128
This is my problem!
Stay out of it, okay?!

245
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,396
Hey! I'm just trying
to help solve

246
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,464
Is that you, Zambai?

247
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,069
Gratitude? You've
gotta be kidding me!

248
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,540
Don't you understand
the situation?!

249
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,309
As hard as it is for you
it's worse on the ship!

250
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,211
She loves you guys so much that

251
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,713
she appeared to
you in human form!

252
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,781
If she sinks to the
bottom of the sea

253
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:48,782
while you're still on board,

254
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,085
then all of that will
have been for nothing!

255
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:52,620
Get it? If that happens,

256
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,722
her final moments will
be filled with regret!

257
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,590
She won't be able
to die in peace!

258
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,591
Is that what you'd do?

259
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,825
After everything you've
been through together,

260
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,162
you'd leave one of your friends
behind to die on their own?

261
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,164
Just throw them
aside like trash?!

262
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,200
That's not the
same thing at all!

263
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,035
This is completely different!

264
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:11,105
It is the same thing, and
that's exactly what's going on!

265
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:13,573
You just don't get it!

266
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,047
Mozu!

267
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:30,624
Kiwi! Who in the
hell did that?!

268
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,195
I apologize for
the interruption.

269
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:40,367
It's just those two
ladies weren't being

270
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,703
very accommodating
about letting us in.

271
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:49,476
It's Galley-La!

272
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,649
What the hell are you
bastards doing down here?!

273
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,163
Galley-La?! What's going on?!

274
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,266
We're secret agents of the World
Government, Mr. Cutty Flam.

275
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:20,267
Where'd you
hear that name?!

276
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,570
You were entrusted with
something rather rare

277
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:25,172
and important by Tom,
the legendary shipwright.

278
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:27,374
And we're here to collect it.

279
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,410
Would you be so kind
as to hand it over?

280
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,778
On the next One Piece:

281
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:34,315
"Franky's Past! The Day
the Sea Train First Ran!"

282
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:36,750
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
