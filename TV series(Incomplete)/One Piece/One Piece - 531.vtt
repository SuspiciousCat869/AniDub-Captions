00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.174
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.246
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.482
[GOLD ROGER] You want
my treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.418
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.653
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.626
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.554
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:37.457
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.095
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:45.198
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.833
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.470
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.474
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.745
[NARRATOR]
Two years have passed

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.980
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.183
Reuniting after their
special training,

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.985
Luffy and his crew continue
on to the New World.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.922
Their first stop is Fishman
Island, thousands of feet

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:12.292
below sea level, where
they meet King Neptune.

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.028
[NEPTUNE
...is to invite you all

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:19.065
to the Ryugu Palace!

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.771
[LUFFY]
"The Ryugu Palace!

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.640
Taken by the Shark
That They Saved!"

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:44.424
[NARRATOR] A few hours before
Luffy met with King Neptune,

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.659
something unexpected happened.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:50.964
An unfortunate encounter with
a barrel at Mermaid Cove.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.267
[ISHILLY] Jeez, they sure
sealed this thing tight!

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:00.540
There must be something
important in there!

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.075
[CORAL-HAIRED MERMAID]
Well, let's think.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.510
It's packed up all nice
like a treasure chest,

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:08.314
but it's still a barrel,
so maybe some fancy booze?

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.552
Oh, c'mon. Almost there.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.620
[CARIBOU]
That'll be enough.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:15.288
Just give me a second.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.556
[yelps]

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.960
[CARIBOU cackles]
That's right. Stand back.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.396
Thank you very much,
ladies, but I think

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.064
I can take it from here!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.934
You mean, there was
a person stuffed in there?

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:28.768
No way!

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.170
[CARIBOU cackling]

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:41.948
[gasps]

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.084
[MERMAIDS scream]

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.624
[cackles] I'm free!

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.128
Thank you so much for your help.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:58.131
I truly couldn't've
done it without you!

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.434
There's no need to run away!

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.002
Hurry! Get to the water!

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:05.371
[MERMAIDS panting]

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:07.740
[yells, laughs]

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:10.376
Too bad! Too slow!

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.046
[MERMAIDS yelping]

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.483
What is this? I'm sinking!

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:19.552
It's mud. But where
did it all come from?

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.187
How very observant of you,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.423
though it's more like
quicksand, technically.

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.192
Consider it my own
personal swamp!

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.928
This is the power of
the Swamp-Swamp Fruit!

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.130
Hardly glamorous,
but I don't mind!

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:34.200
Oh, and by the way, I wouldn't
struggle if I were you!

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.902
[yelps] No!

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.838
That only makes you sink faster!

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.206
Someone help!

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.109
[CARIBOU] Oh, stop screaming.
I'm not gonna kill you.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.511
I'll just suck you
into a mucky hellhole!

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:46.746
Help me!

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.748
What, are you
braindead, lady?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.983
I said "stop
screaming" didn't I?

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.485
Just give it up already!

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.587
Ishilly!

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.655
You're fine!

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:58.157
Calm down and take
a nap, why don't you?

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.397
[cackles]

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:15.708
[CARIBOU chuckles]
It's a good thing

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.343
my body's a bottomless pit,

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.712
since there's plenty more
treasure to put in it!

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.314
Huh. Lemme think here.

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.583
How much do mermaids sell for?

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.085
Seventy million
at auction, right?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.820
And I nabbed three of 'em.

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.690
That is quite the
catch, I must say.

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:35.128
Those stupid Straw Hats
helped me out after all!

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:37.296
If it gets me a free pass
through immigration,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.499
you can lock me
in a barrel any time!

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.100
So what if my plan to cash in

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.269
on their bounties
didn't quite pan out?

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:45.772
Now I can steal all
the mermaids I want!

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:48.174
[CARIBOU cackles]

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.013
[MERO]
Ishilly!

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.015
Where'd you run off to?

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.518
I'm sure I heard
her call for help.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.186
Oh, Ishilly.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:06.058
[NARRATOR] Back in the present,
in the port town of Coral Hill,

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.462
located in the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.397
[GREEN AMMO KNIGHT 531A]
The Straw Hat Pirates.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.299
They must be the ones
who kidnapped your friends

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:15.701
from Mermaid Cove.
Who else could it've been?

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.504
Hold on. They saved
Camie from kidnappers.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:20.239
I'm sure you must be mistaken!

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:23.576
They were nice. They aren't
here to cause any trouble.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:25.077
[GREEN AMMO KNIGHT 531A]
Maybe they needed a hostage.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:25.945
But why?

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.880
First off, let's
look at the facts.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.383
Excluding us guards and you
mermaids, there was nobody else

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:33.219
at the cove around that time,
and those thugs from

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:35.488
the Fishman District
were forced to flee.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:36.989
A number of the Straw Hats left,

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:39.525
but a portion of the crew
is still unaccounted for.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:42.562
We don't know what
their intentions may be.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.797
The temptation for
humans to kidnap mermaids

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:46.265
is just too great.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.501
They're traded at a high
price all over the world

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.837
and we have criminals
like them to thank!

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.371
But they weren't
just any pirates.

00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.207
They saved Camie from slavery!

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.442
Pirates often "make
friends with" mermaids,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.344
and then when they
come down here,

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.314
they use that relationship
to kidnap them!

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.683
[FISHMAN 531A sighs]

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:04.817
[GREEN AMMO KNIGHT 531A]
Prince Fukaboshi!

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.853
Are you certain, Madam Sharley?

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.688
This vision that you saw.

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.459
It is of dire importance, so I
must be sure of its accuracy.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.528
Your silence speaks volumes.

00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.996
Then it is as you say.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.933
Straw Hat will bring
ruin to this island.

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.101
[MERMAID 531A]
Here, Madam Sharley.

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.203
I brought you some water.

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:32.011
It's true. I saw it all,
loud and clear.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.080
Such an awful future.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.582
The accuracy of your
predictions is well known.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.684
I'm convinced that we
must approach this matter

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.920
with the utmost caution.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.855
It is quite the shame, though.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.424
They seem to have a good
reputation with the mermaids

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:46.993
and they saved my sister's pet,

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.128
so I wanted to
treat them kindly.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.597
But now that this new
development has come to light,

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.634
I fear that I must keep
a close eye on them.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:59.138
We have no choice but to
take them all into custody.

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.573
[NARRATOR]
Around the same time.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:02.241
Nearby, in the
high-class district

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.510
known as Fishverly Hills.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.978
[FISHMAN 531AA]
They're gone.

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:08.548
Those weren't just
ordinary pirates, were they?

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.516
Otherwise, King Neptune
wouldn't have given them

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.786
a personal invitation
to Ryugu Palace, huh?

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.922
[laughs]

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:23.529
[NEPTUNE chuckles]
Careful you don't fall! Neptune!

[NEPTUNE]
Jamon. Jamon. Jamon.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:39.545
Jamon. Jamon. Jamon. Neptune!

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.799
[LUFFY] I don't get it.
What's "jamon?"

00:09:59.832 --> 00:10:01.033
Sounds dumb to me.

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:04.036
[yelps]

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.405
Kid, are you stupid
or just plain crazy?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:07.974
You got invited to
the royal palace.

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.175
Don't be a punk!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:13.012
[NEPTUNE laughs]
You have no idea how much

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:16.582
my daughter loves that shark.
It's her favorite pet.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.919
[NEPTUNE]
"Megalo's never coming back!"

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.822
she said, tears
welling up in her eyes.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.791
I had no idea that he had
been attacked by the kraken.

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:29.028
You have my gratitude for
rescuing him from danger.

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.896
Shark! Shark!

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.467
[LUFFY laughs] I can't really
take credit, but whatever.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.434
It all worked out.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.670
So the princess has
a shark for a pet, huh?

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:39.238
Oh? What's that, Pappagu?

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.374
Could it be that
you're not as intimate

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.876
with the princess
as you claimed?

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.778
[PAPPAGU]
Shh!

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.015
[BROOK]
It did sound fishy.

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:53.152
Aquatic puns aside,
I feel so bad for Sanji!

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:56.322
He's stuck in bed, and he wanted
to see the Mermaid Princess

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:57.923
more than anyone else!

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.625
He's had a lot
of bad luck lately,

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.995
and it hasn't even
been his fault. Mostly.

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:07.033
[USOPP]
But if she's got a pet shark,

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.435
she might be kind of intense.

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:12.104
[CAMIE]
Are you sure this is okay?

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.072
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:16.642
I mean, someone like me
going to Ryugu palace.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.110
He said we could
bring our friends,

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.746
and you guys definitely
make the cut!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.449
This is a rare opportunity,
just enjoy it!

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:26.152
And if you think it's bad,
enjoy it even more!

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.120
[NEPTUNE laughs]

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.523
[NEPTUNE] By the way,
I sent my sons to fetch you,

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.992
but they took too long,
and I grew impatient.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.528
I hope they returned
in the meantime.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.396
We're holding
a banquet, you see,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.267
and I simply can't stand
to wait on any more guests!

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.669
I think we're gonna
get along great!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.504
[NAMI]
Gross! Stop drooling!

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.506
[NEPTUNE]
Oh, speaking of guests,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.842
I already invited one
of your crewmates.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:51.210
He's at the palace now.

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:52.445
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:55.181
[NEPTUNE] I must say, he was a
bit lacking in manners, though.

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:58.017
He started drinking before the
banquet, and wouldn't listen

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.585
to reason when I
advised him to wait

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.587
for the other guests to arrive.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.090
I seem to have
forgotten his name.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.858
[USOPP]
Gotta be Zoro.

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.326
[NAMI]
That's Zoro.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:08.427
[NEPTUNE]
Zori!

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:09.695
[BOTH]
It's Zoro, okay?

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.498
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.969
[NEPTUNE] Don't worry,
as surely as they found him.

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:19.338
my soldiers will find
the rest of your crew

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.807
and bring them to the palace.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:25.377
Hey. Got any idea where
everyone else went, Nami?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.812
Oh, uh...

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:31.417
[NAMI squeals]
So many cool shops down here!

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.253
Not to mention plenty of people.
If we ask around enough,

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.555
I'm sure somebody will have
the info we're lookin' for.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.824
Oh, yeah? Then do
you wanna handle it?

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:40.526
If you're lookin'
to shop, that's fine,

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:43.996
but I've got an errand of my
own I'd like to take care of.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:47.933
This is where my old
shipwright master came from.

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:50.402
If his family is
still down here,

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:53.539
I want 'em to know what
an inspiration he was,

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:56.609
and that he was a true man
to the bitter end.

00:12:57.676 --> 00:13:00.613
I know we just got back
together, but if you don't mind,

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:02.581
I'd like to do this on my own.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:05.151
It sounds like it's
pretty important, so sure.

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.686
There's something I'd like
to see while we're here, too.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.121
[NAMI]
Oh, okay.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.323
It's not often that
I get to explore a culture

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:13.993
that's completely removed
from the surface world.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:17.029
Someone with a discerning eye
may uncover its secrets.

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.765
Or even some pieces of
a forgotten history.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.869
That's a Robin thing. For sure.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.939
So, we split up again,
but it wasn't a big deal.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.541
No trouble on your end, right?

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:32.511
[USOPP] Uh... Well,
maybe an itty-bitty bit.

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:37.650
Hey, fish king,
I have a question.

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:41.687
[yells] That's "Lord Neptune,
the God of the Sea" to you!

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:49.028
[NAMI] If we're 10,000
meters below sea level,

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:52.198
why is it so bright and
sunny everywhere we go?

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:55.034
[NEPTUNE] Well, that's likely
what our ancestors thought

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:57.503
when they first arrived here.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:01.340
This is the only place in the
deep sea that light reaches.

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:05.044
It is a glorious, glowing beacon
for all of Fishman kind

00:14:05.077 --> 00:14:08.247
and has been for as long
as anyone can remember.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.917
We owe it all to the
giant Sun Tree, Eve,

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.320
whose mighty roots
stretch to these depths,

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.156
carrying shimmering
sunlight along with them.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:20.526
[NAMI] "Sun Tree?" So are
its roots bioluminescent

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:23.395
or does it just transfer
sunlight from the surface?

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.664
[NEPTUNE] The latter,
it seems, though scientists

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.500
have puzzled over the
specifics for ages.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:31.470
The respiration of its
roots also supplies oxygen

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:33.305
from the surface to our island.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.041
Regardless, we owe
our entire civilization

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.644
to this single, mystic tree.

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.479
So, it's like the big
brother, or in this case,

00:14:40.512 --> 00:14:43.282
big sister of the
mangroves in Sabaody.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.018
Hey, hairy fish dude,
I'm gettin' hungry.

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:46.852
Come on!

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:50.222
[NEPTUNE laughs]
We'll be there soon.

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:52.057
Ooh!

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.263
It's huge!

00:14:57.296 --> 00:15:00.299
[NEPTUNE]
That's the entrance. Get ready.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:04.403
[laughs]

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.922
[DOOR SNAIL 531A]
Ding dong!

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:23.689
[GUARD 351AA]
Yeah?

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:24.790
[NEPTUNE]
Neptune.

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.459
[GUARD 351AA]
Oh, h-h-hello, your highness!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.695
Allow me to open the gate.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.766
[NEPTUNE]
Here. You'll want one of these.

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.669
Yeah, what is it?

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.170
It's a Bubbly Coral.

00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:40.806
It lets you make a little
bubble whenever you want to.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.675
[NEPTUNE]
Land dwellers don't visit often,

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:45.244
so much of the palace
is submerged in water.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:47.813
We don't want anyone drowning.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:53.652
[GROUP gasps]

00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.223
Can we take these as souvenirs?

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:01.226
[NEPTUNE]
Now, forward!

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.731
Neptune!

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:08.233
[LUFFY laughs]
It's fast!

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.070
[NAMI] This is fun, but I
can't wait to see the palace!

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.806
I'm getting kind of nervous.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:16.775
Yeah, I know, it could be
life-changing for me, too.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.945
Just think. What if this
makes me even more famous?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.715
Interesting. So
starfish can sweat!

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:25.484
[laughs]

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.655
[NEPTUNE]
Jamon! We're here!

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.924
[ALL]
Ooh!

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:53.479
Whoa! Those dragons are sweet!

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:56.482
Pappagu's house seems positively
shabby in comparison.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.983
Hey, watch your mouth!

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.753
[NAMI]
Buy me one of these, Luffy!

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:05.090
[GUARD 351BB]
King Neptune has returned!

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:07.226
[GUARD 351CC] We were wondering
where you ran off to!

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.694
[GUARD 351DD]
Hurry, let them in!

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.229
[GUARD 351EE]
Opening the gate!

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:18.404
[GUARDS] Greetings,
your highness. Welcome back!

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:22.608
[laughs] Now this
is gonna be fun!

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.811
[NEPTUNE]
Make yourselves at home.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.379
You are my honored guests.

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:30.349
Not again! And you
brought guests along!

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:32.751
I've told you not to leave
the palace on your own,

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.720
but you don't listen
to a word I say!

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:37.122
If you can't take guards
and you can't inform your staff,

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.091
then you can't leave the
palace and that's final!

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.659
Shame on you, sir!

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:44.096
[NEPTUNE]
Jamon! It won't happen again!

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:46.031
[GROUP]
He got scolded?

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.767
There are so many countless ways
this could have gone wrong.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.336
Our kingdom is in a volatile
political state right now.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.238
Surely as its king,
you realize that!

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.207
[stomach growls]

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.277
Can we just have
the banquet already?

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.149
Ooh!

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.484
[NEPTUNE]
If you could stop scolding me,

00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:08.253
you'll notice that I brought
back some very important people.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:10.756
They're the pirates who saved
Megalo from the kraken!

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:11.657
[MINISTERS]
Huh?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:12.958
[NEPTUNE]
Let's welcome them properly

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.294
so I can maintain my dignity.

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:17.629
Hm? Where is Shirahoshi?

00:18:17.663 --> 00:18:19.598
The princess should
be here for this.

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:20.866
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Actually, your highness,

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:23.302
we had another incident.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.942
[NEPTUNE]
And she found out?

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.111
Don't give her another
thing to worry about!

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:34.947
She's a very delicate girl!
You know that!

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.582
Don't you give me that!

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.383
If you don't want your
daughter to worry,

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.986
then how about you stay here in
the palace where it's safe

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.921
instead of running
off unguarded?

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:44.556
We thought you might be dead!

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.260
[NEPTUNE] It won't
happen again, I promise.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.562
[GROUP]
Wow, again!

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.030
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
It's a bit unfortunate

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.999
that you brought
the guests yourself.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:56.168
There was a development
while you were out

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.137
and a rather troubling
one, at that.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.506
Indeed. Prince Fukaboshi called

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:03.342
and informed us of something
better relayed in private.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.177
Oh, my goodness,
this is quite awkward.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.547
[NEPTUNE] I trust our guests.
Out with it already.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.550
That's the thing, sir.

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:14.453
[BROOK]
So... are we eating or...?

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.922
Hold on. Where'd Luffy go?

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.491
[USOPP] Uh... He was
here just a second ago!

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.260
He couldn't stand still
for five minutes

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.794
if his life depended on it!

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.163
This is the royal palace,

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:26.532
you don't just wander
around here on your own!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.776
I'm not here to watch
some hairy fish dude

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:43.348
get chewed out. I'm here to eat!
And I smell food this way!

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.450
Getting closer.

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:55.260
Huh?

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:06.972
Huh. No water in here.
That's weird.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.377
Oh!

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.216
Can't smell anything now.

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.952
The food must be through
those giant doors.

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:32.564
[LUFFY]
Ooh.

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:36.301
This place looks pretty fancy.
It must be the banquet hall.

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:39.605
Let's hope Zoro hasn't
eaten all the good stuff.

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:42.307
But man, kinda
intimidating, isn't it?

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.743
The doors are overkill.

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:46.878
I feel like I'm
back in Impel Down.

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.815
They really don't want people
gettin' their food, huh?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:53.051
That must mean whatever they've
got in there is super good!

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:04.930
Huh. It's dark. Why is it dark?

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:10.869
[LUFFY] Well, who cares?
The food smells great!

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.804
Maybe it's gonna
be a surprise party.

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:15.307
Either way, I think
I've waited long enough!

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.042
A little snack won't hurt!

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:21.380
[LUFFY] Wait, is this the
table? Why is it squishy?

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.387
[LUFFY]
What is this?

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.124
Feels like some kinda coral,
but why's it in a banquet hall?

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.529
[LUFFY]
Squishy again. Weird.

00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.698
[VOICE grunting]

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:40.866
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:43.735
If someone's here, could
you turn on the lights?

00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:51.710
[LUFFY laughs] Still really
confused, but this sure is fun!

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.581
[VOICE]
Hello? Who's there?

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:57.849
[gasps]

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:02.487
[yells]

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.923
[SHIRAHOSHI]
What a horrid thing to do!

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:07.326
[LUFFY grunts]

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:12.664
[SHIRAHOSHI] Bouncing on a poor,
helpless girl such as myself!

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:19.771
[SHIRAHOSHI] Who are you, sir,
and what are you doing here?

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:21.707
Please don't hurt me!

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:27.079
Whoa, that's one big lady.

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.980
Uh, I mean big fish lady.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.415
Have you come
to kill me, too?

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:32.818
Because I will have you
know, I am not afraid!

00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:34.353
No. Not of you.

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:36.321
Not of anyone else, either!

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.557
I am the daughter
of King Neptune!

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.560
I'm not... I'm not
afraid of anything!

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:42.994
Nothing at all!

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:56.007
[sobs] Someone help me!
Father, please! Brother, please!

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:59.344
Hey, wait! I didn't come
here to kill you, okay?

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:05.317
[sobbing]

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.621
Ah! You suck, lady!
Shut up already!

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.327
[NARRATOR]
Plagued by Vander Decken,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.763
the mermaid princess
Shirahoshi has been confined

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.698
to the Hard Shell
Tower for years.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:22.067
With its doors open
for even a moment,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.303
Decken launches an axe
straight at her heart.

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:28.039
Meanwhile, things take a sour
turn for the Straw Hat Pirates

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:31.977
in the palace as Neptune's army
suddenly surrounds them.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.612
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.347
"A Coward and a Crybaby!

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.682
The Princess in the
Hard Shell Tower!"

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:40.285
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
