00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,342
I have to apologize to you
for something first! Please!

175
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,177
This sticky bun.

176
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,379
This is the sticky bun
that you wanted

177
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,182
and I hid to have
all for myself.

178
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,118
If I'd known you were gonna die,
I would've saved half for you.

179
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,353
Honest, I would've.

180
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,754
Now I'll have to eat
the whole thing,

181
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,524
but I know I'm not
gonna enjoy it.

182
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,594
My bun.

183
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,230
My precious!

184
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,067
That brainless little fool,

185
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,703
where did she manage to
lose herself this time?

186
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,907
This is why I told her to pipe
down and hide, but no!

187
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,375
She has to go running
off on her own

188
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,110
and make me waste time
looking for her.

189
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,045
Stupid Nami!

190
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,086
[NAMI]
That's it! I can't run anymore!

191
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,088
I'll have to fight!

192
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,930
[NAMI]
Like hell!

193
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,266
[MR. 1]
This is taking too long.

194
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,168
So hasty.

195
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,238
[screams]

196
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,843
Zoro!

197
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,618
That stone column just
split into pieces!

198
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,088
[ZORO]
It didn't split.

199
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,990
It was sliced.

200
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:54,660
Only a swordsman could've
done something like that.

201
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,830
That's right.

202
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,836
[ZORO]
You cut it, didn't you?

203
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,938
With those arms, huh?

204
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,210
You've got a rather
unusual body, don't you?

205
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,445
[MR. 1]
You noticed.

206
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,949
I ate the Dice Dice Fruit,
making blades of my entire body.

207
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,184
You're him.

208
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,986
The swordsman who
supposedly cut down

209
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,822
a hundred men at Whiskey Peak.

210
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,990
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
He's also the pirate

211
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,992
who turned down an invitation
to join Baroque Works

212
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,960
several years ago at East Blue,

213
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:31,130
and cut down our
Mr. 7 at the time.

214
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,465
That was you too?

215
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,668
Ha! That's a story
that takes me back.

216
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,170
That little misunderstanding
was your Mr. 7's fault

217
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,040
for not accepting the
terms I offered him.

218
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:45,177
As I remember it, I made a
very generous proposition.

219
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:48,080
I said, "Sure, I'll join, as
long as you make me your boss."

220
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,348
[chuckles]

221
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,417
You're quite a
comedian, aren't you?

222
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,019
Instead of meeting my terms,

223
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,854
he rather rudely took
a slash at me,

224
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,923
so naturally, I put
him in his place.

225
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,226
Now would you like
to invite me too?

226
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,162
'Cause right now, you guys
look so ridiculous,

227
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,032
I wouldn't even accept the job.

228
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,366
[MR. 1 yells]

229
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,938
You think you can make
a fool out of me?

230
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,078
You, some swordsman from
an upstart pirate crew?

231
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,281
[ZORO] Maybe I am, but what
do you think you guys are?

232
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,549
Puppets with no
will of your own

233
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:28,054
being manipulated by Crocodile
into building his fake utopia.

234
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,223
Or maybe you're all just
little tin soldiers.

235
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,795
All shine and no steel.

236
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,230
Miss Doublefinger.

237
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,434
I know, I know, you want to
eliminate him, don't you?

238
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,738
You do as you please.
I'll take care of the girl.

239
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,808
Uh! Nami, be careful‐‐
Okay... she's gone.

240
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,411
[MR. 1 growling]

241
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,451
[NAMI]
Twirling, twirling!

242
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,955
A 320,000‐spin finishing
Grand Fouette!

243
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:04,957
What's this?

244
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,392
[BON CLAY]
Ballet Kenpo!

245
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,428
Memoirs of a Summer's Day!

246
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,264
I see your weakness.

247
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,768
There's a flaw in your attack.

248
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,952
There's a flaw in your attack.

249
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,487
[BON CLAY]
Memoirs of a Summer's Day!

250
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,288
[SANJI]
Joue Shoot!

251
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,362
Sure enough, I was right.

252
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,365
You've seen through it,
you say? Through what?

253
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,502
What part of my ability could a
philistine like you appreciate,

254
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,303
let alone see through?

255
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,304
Only this.

256
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,373
That you can't use your
precious Ballet Kenpo

257
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,275
while you're assuming
Nami's form.

258
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,810
[grunts]

259
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,880
It's true, I can't bring
myself to attack you

260
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,148
while you look like Nami,

261
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,817
but it's pretty clear you have
to return to your normal self

262
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,153
before you try to attack me.

263
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,321
And it happens whenever
I see you touch your cheek

264
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,357
with your left hand.

265
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,562
[BON CLAY laughing]

266
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,332
Eh? What? I can't hear you!

267
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,468
Hey! I'm right, aren't I?

268
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,372
Well‐‐ Well, so what
if you are right, pal?

269
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,406
All right, all right.

270
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,909
It's only with this magnificent
godlike physique

271
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,143
that I've patiently developed,

272
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,979
putting in day after day of
rigorous and brutal lessons,

273
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,148
that I am able to perform
my Ballet Kenpo.

274
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,383
But so what?

275
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,653
You're still plenty black and
blue, aren't you, Mr. Big Talk?

276
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:45,024
Now, take a look at
the prima of Ballet Kenpo!

277
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,359
I'll say this much about it,
then you're dead.

278
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,430
The one on your left is the pen
and on your right is the cob.

279
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,531
[SANJI]
Who cares?

280
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,266
[laughs]

281
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,535
Whether you see through it
or not doesn't matter!

282
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,038
Now! Prepare to die!

283
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,041
Behold the power of
my Ballet Kenpo!

284
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,009
Bombardier!

285
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,050
[SANJI] What? He punched
a hole in the wall!

286
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,118
[laughing]

287
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,421
You dodged it! Smart thinking!

288
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,191
At the end of their bent
necks are steel beaks!

289
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,228
[SANJI] He didn't even crack
the plaster around the hole!

290
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,263
True power, when
compressed and focused

291
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,198
into a single point of contact,

292
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,367
will not destroy
anything needlessly.

293
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,903
It might be best if you were to
try thinking of one of my kicks

294
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,239
like a shot from a
high‐powered rifle.

295
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,306
Of course, in this case,

296
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,042
the bullets are of a
drastically higher caliber.

297
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,545
I'm going to perforate you!

298
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,247
Un!

299
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,248

301
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,986
No good!

302
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,392
[SANJI] Damn! His reach
is longer than mine!

303
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,327
[laughing]

304
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,263
Looks like the fight is over!

305
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,965
I'm flying like a swan!

Ballet Kenpo!
Memoirs of a Winter Sky!

307
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,940
[SANJI]
But the longer his reach is,

308
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:10,609
the longer it takes
him to recover.

309
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,246
If I can avoid his kick,

310
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,115
I'll have that much
more time to attack.

311

And just what do you think
you're gonna do now, lover boy?

Hey, something's stuck
to your left cheek.

Huh? Really?

What's the matter?

All you have to do is
turn into Nami again

I can't move, with
the shape I'm in.

347
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:07,453
There's no point trying to
avoid the outcome of this.

348
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,621
I congratulate you.

349
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,790
Now kill me.

350
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:17,463
You may as well. Baroque
Works will do it anyway.

351
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,632
Don't just stand there,
get it over with.

352
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,368
Come on, finish me.

353
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,538
[gasps]

354
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,309
It was a good fight,
and beyond that,

355
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,145
we don't need anymore
words, do we?

356
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,287
[BON CLAY chuckles]

357
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,822
[BON CLAY]
This is, without question,

358
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:49,795
the deep respect that arises
between rival, but I won't cry!

359
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,332
[SANJI]
Bye now!

360
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,201
Oh, and I'm takin' back our
sharpshooter's goggles.

361
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,002
[BON CLAY groans]

362
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,905
[BON CLAY]
Well, he did finish me.

363
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,376
[SANJI grumbles]

364
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,713
I think I cracked a
couple of my bones again.

365
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,501
Uh, everything is ready
as you ordered, Princess!

366
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,703
[GUARD H]
Everything is set here, too!

367
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,344
[VIVI] This castle has been
a part of Alabasta's history

368
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,880
for 4,000 years.

369

‐‐[VIVI laughing]

370
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,457
[VIVI] It's been a great
source of pride to me.

371
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,929
[VIVI] But if we destroy
the royal palace,

372
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,897
the people will have to stop
fighting with each other

373
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,399
and pay attention!

374
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,367
I'll finally be able to
tell everyone the truth

375
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,537
about this horrible conspiracy
in my own words!

376
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,414
All right, light your fuses!

377
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,815

What is this?

381
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,802
[VIVI]
You okay?

382
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:42,608
It... was him.

383
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,344
[CROCODILE]
We can't have this.

384
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,689
That was rather treacherous
on your part, wasn't it?

385
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,858
Huh, Miss Wednesday?

386
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,595
After all, my dear, this is
about to be my house.

387
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,330
No, I'll never let you!

388
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,598

389
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,034
[CHAKA]
Your Majesty!

390
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,603
[VIVI]
Uh! Father!

391
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,508
This is lovely. To
have a palace like this.

392
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,478
[CROCODILE laughs]

393
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,380
It's a marvelous place
to look down

394
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,950
on all the filth
and rabble below.

395
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,119
Where‐Where is Luffy?

396
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,453
Who's that?

397
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,023
Oh, you mean Straw Hat?

398
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,959
That miserable young rookie?

399
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,865
My dear, he's dead.
