WEBVTT

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.649
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:40.555
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.622 --> 00:02:45.698
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.510
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:53.413
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.919
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.724
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.793 --> 00:03:02.999
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.502
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:12.985
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:18.463
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.835
and launched an attack
on the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.039
who had controlled
the Kingdom of Dressrosa

00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:24.543
and threatened to
kill its people.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.681
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:28.417
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.621
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:34.629
until finally, Luffy took down
Doflamingo himself.

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:08.296
I didn't picture you to be
a cottage man, Kyros.

00:04:08.362 --> 00:04:09.833
[KYROS]
Quaint, is it not?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.572
It was something Scarlet and I
found suitable at the time.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.078
I apologize if it's not
as elegant as the palace.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:17.248
It'll do.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.720
Here's some provisions.
Help yourselves.

00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:21.055
Question, Sir Law!

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:24.195
Who is this towheaded fellow
that you brought back with you?

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:25.464
[LAW]
Straw Hat's friend.

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.602
I didn't wanna
just leave him there.

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:28.537
Don't mind me.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:30.842
I'm going to turn in
for the night.

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:33.848
You're all welcome to anything
you find in the pantry.

00:04:33.914 --> 00:04:37.154
Though, that may be
limited to dry meat.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.323
Meat...

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.325
Then we should make sure
we get our fill

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:41.830
before the carnivore wakes up.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.704
[USOPP]
No way! He's out cold already?

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:48.878
Come on! And you, too?

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.748
[ROBIN chuckles]

00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:55.558
Like you have
any room to talk, bro.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.396
Well, can't really
blame him, can we?

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:01.636
My money's on him sleeping in
longer than anybody.

00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:04.742
[ROBIN] I think it's for
the best if we let them be.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:08.951
[ZORO] You think there'd be
at least one bottle

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.788
of hooch hidden away--

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:15.363
Someone's here.

00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.071
[SABO]
Hey, catch.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.077
Sabo!

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.948
Hey.

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:24.950
[ZORO]
You know him?

00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:27.589
That's Sabo. Luffy's brother.

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:29.491
[ZORO, FRANKY]
He is?

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:33.032
[chuckles]

00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:42.284
He's a Revolutionary Army buddy?

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.255
[ROBIN]
Correct. Hey, Luffy.

00:05:44.322 --> 00:05:47.227
Wait. No need to wake him up.

00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.133
I just came to see him
before I go.

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.114
Go? So soon?

00:05:57.181 --> 00:05:58.651
Yeah. There's some trouble

00:05:58.718 --> 00:06:01.022
heading towards
Dressrosa as we speak.

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:02.190
Who's "trouble"?

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:03.928
It's CP-0.

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:05.664
[gasps]

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.305
Remember the Doflamingo mix-up?

00:06:09.372 --> 00:06:11.543
They played a key role in it.

00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:32.752
I'd be real cautious.
They're coming for us.

00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:40.501
Things are gonna get a bit crazy
around here in a day or two.

00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:41.636
It'd be in your best interest

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:44.475
to hit the road
as soon as possible.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:47.247
We appreciate it. Thank you.

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:51.823
Well, we weren't really planning
on stayin' here long anyway.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.865
I'm still kinda shocked that
Luffy has another brother.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.403
[FRANKY] Right?
It's the first I heard of it.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.608
That figures.

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:03.580
I think it surprised
Luffy most of all.

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.586
You wanna follow up on that one?

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:10.327
[SABO] Many years ago,
I was presumed to be dead.

00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:11.963
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:17.675
Luffy, Ace, and I were
inseparable, running amok,

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:20.346
and raising all sorts of hell.

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:23.386
In the city,
in the forest, anywhere.

00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:26.492
Ol' Garp would try
his best to keep us in line.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.197
But we wanted to
grow up and be pirates.

00:07:42.558 --> 00:07:44.629
[SABO] We made a vow
and became brothers

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:47.434
by sharing some sakÃ© together.

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:51.109
[snoring]

00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:54.782
But one day, I was involved
in a bad accident.

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:57.788
Or rather, a bad incident.

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:02.565
Say. I was wondering.

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:04.535
Did you know that there's
supposed to be a fire

00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:07.207
going on in
Gray Terminal tonight?

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:10.781
[NOBLE C] It's important
we all keep our mouths shut.

00:08:10.848 --> 00:08:13.687
We come from
great noble families.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:15.692
[SABO]
Ace! Luffy!

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.628
There's something
wrong with this town!

00:08:17.695 --> 00:08:19.799
Something wrong
with these people!

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.703
They know people are gonna die.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.574
They're happy people
are going to die!

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.278
They're sick!
This whole place is sick!

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:27.882
I can't stay here any longer!

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:30.788
I have to tell them, right now!

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:36.298
[SABO]
Luffy! Ace! Run!

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:47.588
[DRAGON]
What happened to you, boy?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:57.240
[SABO] High Town reeks worse
than Gray Terminal ever did.

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.650
The people act civilized, but on
the inside, they're all rotten!

00:09:01.717 --> 00:09:03.721
They only care about
making themselves look good,

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:06.292
no matter what it takes!

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:08.329
I can't stay here.

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:10.802
If I do, then I'll
never be free!

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:12.237
[gasps]

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:22.993
[SABO]
Don't worry, guys. I'm fine.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:27.000
I just wish I could
see you, even once.

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:30.340
[SABO]
It looks nice from the outside.

00:09:30.407 --> 00:09:32.277
But this house is a birdcage.

00:09:32.344 --> 00:09:34.516
I'm gonna lose my mind
if I have to stay in this

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:37.287
stuffy, stuck-up place.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.602
[SABO]
I thought I found freedom,

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:47.608
but it seems to
keep slipping away.

00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.516
Nice weather today!

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:54.387
It's just perfect
for setting sail!

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:59.264
[gasps] Wow,
that's one big ship!

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.852
Insolent fool!

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:13.259
Damn!

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:16.533
Why'd he shoot at me?

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:18.436
[JALMACK SUBORDINATE A]
Saint Jalmack!

00:10:18.504 --> 00:10:19.973
There's a child on that ship!

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.679
[JALMACK] Anyone who flies a
black flag is a filthy pirate!

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:24.549
His age is irrelevant.

00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:26.252
He must pay.

00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:27.721
[JALMACK SUBORDINATE A gasps]

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:31.262
[gasps]

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:33.032
A commoner should know better.

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.907
Don't cross my ship,
you stupid pirate brat!

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:38.142
[gasps]

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.237
[SABO]
Ace. Luffy.

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:13.412
[SABO]
Help me. Somebody.

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:16.451
Please. Help.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.164
[IVANKOV]
He's late! Too late!

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.200
What happened?

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:42.839
What in the world
is keeping him so long?

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:45.877
Ivankov, please, calm down!

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.850
How can I?

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:54.562
Not when, my head's just
throbbing with frustration!

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:56.365
I might explode!

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:57.802
[REVOLUTIONARIES gasp]

00:11:57.869 --> 00:11:59.739
Or maybe not!

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:01.510
[REVOLUTIONARIES]
You had us going!

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:04.381
Heehaw!

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:11.028
[IVANKOV]
You certainly kept me waiting!

00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:13.466
What could be more
important than me?

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:14.636
Sorry.

00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:17.875
[IVANKOV gasps]
Goodness, is that...?

00:12:19.846 --> 00:12:21.248
That boy's in rough shape.

00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:24.756
Hey! Hurt boy!
Help! Get the medic!

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:26.960
[REVOLUTIONARY B]
Prepare treatment! Go!

00:12:38.415 --> 00:12:39.351
He's awake!

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:40.788
[screams]

00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:42.256
[INAZUMA]
Don't startle the poor thing.

00:12:42.323 --> 00:12:45.029
Gimme a break!
I wasn't trying to!

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:47.534
Rude! You big ole meanie.

00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:55.016
What the-- Where am I?

00:12:55.082 --> 00:12:57.253
You're onboard our ship.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.765
It says "Sabo"
on all your belongings.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:05.303
I'm guessing that's your name.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.677
Sabo? I dunno.

00:13:08.744 --> 00:13:10.179
That can't be right.

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:13.318
Well. Then what is
your name, boy?

00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:16.391
No idea.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:18.196
Think he lost his memory?

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.497
Perhaps.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.976
[DRAGON] You're telling me, the
kid doesn't remember a thing?

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:26.980
[REVOLUTIONARY D]
No. Not even his own name.

00:13:27.047 --> 00:13:29.418
Well, I found the boy
washed up ashore

00:13:29.484 --> 00:13:32.858
over in the Highland
of the Goa Kingdom.

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:36.098
I'm sure that means he's got
some noble blood in him.

00:13:36.164 --> 00:13:38.804
I bet you his parents
are worried sick.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.507
We should take him back.

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:45.283
No thanks. Don't bother!

00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:46.820
Why not?

00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:48.790
I dunno why!

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:54.401
I just... have a feeling
telling me not to go!

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:57.508
[IVANKOV]
We can't have you freeloading

00:13:57.575 --> 00:13:59.477
on this ship forever, squirt!

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:02.417
We have things to do!
You'll get in the way!

00:14:02.483 --> 00:14:03.887
That's fine.

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:06.793
Then drop me off
anywhere else but back there!

00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:08.129
[REVOLUTIONARIES gasp]

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:12.170
You're just a kid!
That would be irresponsible!

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.610
I'm begging you.

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:27.968
Well, Dragon, whatcha think?

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:04.141
[TANK] You won't run into
the Navy around these parts.

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:07.582
And the town doctor
should be arriving shortly.

00:15:07.648 --> 00:15:09.484
We really appreciate it.

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:10.386
And booze?

00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:12.791
There'll be plenty
at the banquet.

00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:15.598
What about now? Why wait?

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.033
Suck it up.

00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:20.473
[SAI] All right, might as well
get some rest for now.

00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:24.047
Hold up!

00:15:24.114 --> 00:15:25.483
[ALL]
Huh?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.854
Cabbage! Don't you even think
about conkin' out here!

00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.894
And why not?
I deserve my rest also.

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.433
Someone! Bring me a chain!

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.169
A big strong one! Now!

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:37.440
This freak needs a leash!

00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:42.416
Huh? What are you doing,
Bartolomeo?

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.055
Getting' myself
a good night sleep!

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.496
[FRANKY] That's how ya
joined the Revolutionaries?

00:15:48.563 --> 00:15:50.166
Well, kinda.

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:51.970
The only thing I knew for sure

00:15:52.037 --> 00:15:54.174
was that I had this
incredibly strong desire

00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:57.113
not to go back to my parents.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.294
But other than that,
I didn't recall a thing.

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:12.176
[HACK]
Drop your center of gravity!

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:15.951
If you can't do this then you'll
be useless on the battlefield.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.957
Yeah, I'm out.
My muscles are just fine.

00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:21.696
Hold on, Sabo!
Where are you going?

00:16:23.499 --> 00:16:24.167
Uh--

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:27.006
I'll train myself, thanks.

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.114
[HACK gasps]

00:16:31.882 --> 00:16:33.318
[IVANKOV]
How's the boy doing?

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:34.956
[HACK]
He may have lost his memory,

00:16:35.023 --> 00:16:36.692
but it's clear
his body remembers

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:38.329
how he used to move about.

00:16:38.396 --> 00:16:41.401
I'm not sure what kinda of
hijinks he was up to before,

00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:43.673
but clearly he was a scrapper.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.880
I'm getting the impression
he was a problem-child.

00:16:46.946 --> 00:16:48.482
He's quite the handful.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.185
Oh?

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.460
[chuckles]

00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:13.432
[HACK]
Don't think you've won!

00:17:18.242 --> 00:17:20.013
--[SABO chuckles]
--[HACK gasps]

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.252
[REVOLUTIONARIES laugh]

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:33.338
You wanna piece of me,
too, Kuma? Then let's go!

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:38.549
[SABO screams]

00:17:39.652 --> 00:17:41.723
Yeah, he's tough!

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:44.227
[grunts]

00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:48.468
[ACE] Someday we're gonna
set sail, just like Sabo.

00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:51.208
We're gonna live the way
we wanna live.

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:53.880
More free than anyone else.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.484
[ACE]
Let's go out to sea at 17,

00:17:56.552 --> 00:18:01.696
just like Sabo planned,
then, we'll be pirates!

00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.570
[REVOLUTIONARY F] When you're
done, peel these, too.

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:08.375
Huh? Aww.

00:18:11.047 --> 00:18:11.883
[chomp]

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.252
Wanna snack, too?

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:15.557
Take this seriously!

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:17.360
Jeez, I'm sorry!

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:26.545
[BOTH]
Sabo!

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:28.148
[chuckles]

00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:50.359
[SABO grunts]

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:52.698
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:54.935
Hya!

00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.137
Huh?

00:18:58.643 --> 00:19:00.346
And how did he think
that would go?

00:19:00.412 --> 00:19:04.688
Well, he's got some spunk,
taking on the higher ups.

00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:11.569
Look for me in the papers--
it won't take long, okay?

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.177
Kick some ass! Bon voyage!

00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:26.331
Fire!

00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:32.377
No good. I can't reach them.

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:35.149
They should have opened
the front gates for us by now!

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.788
What in the blazes
could be holding them up?

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:39.157
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C rings]

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:40.159
Cuh-lick.

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:41.529
[SABO]
Stand by! New plan!

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:43.065
[REVOLUTIONARY G]
Sabo! Where are you?

00:19:43.131 --> 00:19:44.835
--Cuh-lick.
--[REVOLUTIONARY H] Dammit!

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.580
[ALL]
Sabo!

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:54.154
[KOALA] He's going in
way too deep again!

00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:55.356
[SOLDIER B]
Is he insane?

00:19:55.423 --> 00:19:57.259
[SOLDIER C]
Take him out!

00:20:01.535 --> 00:20:03.639
Is this guy bulletproof?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.279
[grunts]

00:20:13.793 --> 00:20:15.864
Now follow Sabo!

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:22.711
Come in, Sabo.

00:20:22.778 --> 00:20:25.349
Confirming we've successfully
freed the prisoners!

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:26.986
We're leaving the rest to you!

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.288
[SABO]
Got it!

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:29.958
Cuh-lick.

00:20:31.796 --> 00:20:34.902
[SOLDIER H]
Stop! You can't escape!

00:20:42.652 --> 00:20:46.357
Look what we got here.
Blondie's alone!

00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:51.468
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:56.946
This is the spot.
Dragon Claw Fist!

00:20:57.013 --> 00:20:59.051
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:20:59.117 --> 00:21:01.823
And now, Dragon Breath!

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.498
[SOLDIERS scream]

00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:11.910
[SABO]
And that takes care of that.

00:21:11.976 --> 00:21:15.249
Had to show-off, didn't you?

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.521
[SABO chuckles]

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:19.992
[REVOLUTIONARY I]
You're really something,

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.796
accomplishing so much so young.

00:21:21.862 --> 00:21:23.533
[REVOLUTIONARY J] I bet that it
won't be too long before

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.838
we're calling you
commander, Sabo.

00:21:25.904 --> 00:21:27.073
Hey, that reminds me.

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:29.778
There's a pirate about your age
moving up in the world.

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:32.216
Turned down a position
in the Seven Warlords.

00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:34.689
Oh. Right! The "Fire Fist" guy?

00:21:34.755 --> 00:21:36.057
Yeah?

00:21:36.124 --> 00:21:38.195
[REVOLUTIONARY I] Seems he's got
a wild streak, just like you.

00:21:38.262 --> 00:21:40.232
Anyway. He's bound to
shake things up

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.803
in the New World, ya know?

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.075
If I remember,
his name is Portgas D...

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:46.345
Ace.

00:21:46.412 --> 00:21:49.718
You do know him!
You should have told us!

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:52.824
Hold up. Did I just
say something?

00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:54.427
Huh?

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:56.432
You got memory loss again, Sabo?

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:59.070
[REVOLUTIONARIES laugh]

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.894
Ahh! Perfect weather
today! Lucky me!

00:22:13.766 --> 00:22:16.037
This won't play out
like last time.

00:22:16.104 --> 00:22:20.345
I've been practicing this move
for ten whole years!

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.873
So you're telling me

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.579
you didn't get your memories
back until two years ago?

00:22:36.645 --> 00:22:37.615
Yeah.

00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:39.552
I'm surprised they
came back to you at all.

00:22:39.618 --> 00:22:41.388
Kinda weird, isn't it?

00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:43.793
I actually have Ace
to thank for that.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.661
Huh?

00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:46.397
Huh?

00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:48.636
Or that's what I believe.

00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:53.746
It happened in the worst
possible way though.

00:22:55.884 --> 00:22:58.322
[snoring]

00:22:58.389 --> 00:23:00.594
That tragedy...

00:23:00.661 --> 00:23:03.465
...is what awakened my memories.

00:23:14.187 --> 00:23:16.592
[NARRATOR] The conflict at
Marineford was a momentous war

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:18.997
that changed the lives
of many, Sabo included.

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.034
After learning of
Ace's untimely death,

00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:22.505
he becomes overcome with emotion

00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:24.641
as his memories come
rushing back to him.

00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:27.447
He recounts the story of
that unforgettable day

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:29.551
and what events
lead him to Dressrosa.
