WEBVTT

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.548
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.798
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.514
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.233
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.736
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:13.219
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:17.494
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:19.365
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.435
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.545
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:28.618
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:31.489
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:33.794
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.232
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.370
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:41.076
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:45.518
Within moments,
you'll be food for the worms.

00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.658
You worked hard, but for what?

00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:52.632
Well. It doesn't
have to be for nothing.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:57.708
[DOFLAMINGO]
Trafalgar D. Water Law.

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.519
Come on, don't let
that power go to waste.

00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:06.225
This is your final shot.
So listen.

00:04:06.258 --> 00:04:10.066
You've been given a chance
to change this world.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.741
So. Do the Perpetual
Youth Surgery.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:16.379
Put that Op-Op Fruit
to good use.

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:19.419
Then you die. And...

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:21.456
Since I'm a fair man,

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.197
in exchange, I'll grant you
whatever you desire.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.067
[TREBOL]
Now that's generous!

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.637
[LAW]
Whatever.

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:32.845
My wish is for you
to bring back Cora.

00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.720
[LAW] And when you're done,
I want you to lick the asses

00:04:36.754 --> 00:04:39.693
of every last person
in this kingdom.

00:04:39.726 --> 00:04:41.329
The Straw Hat Pirates
have performed

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:44.234
countless miracles
along their journeys.

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:48.744
[LAW] Someone like you never
had a chance of stopping them.

00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:54.454
Also, you're wrong if you think
you can get Caesar back!

00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:56.826
[LAW groans]

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:04.474
Doflamingo!

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.147
[LUFFY]
Hey. Traffy!

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.118
Where's all this
blood coming from?

00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:10.822
Where'd your arm go?

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:12.157
Hey! Traffy!

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:14.295
Hang in there! Hey!

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:18.436
[DOFLAMINGO]
What, you can't tell? He's dead.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.910
You'll pay for this,
you bastards!

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:25.084
And now, we end this game.

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.388
Mingo!

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.424
--[LAW] Wait.
--[gasps]

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.863
[LAW]
Listen carefully, Straw Hat.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.544
Oh no.

00:06:30.313 --> 00:06:32.518
It's moving. I knew it!

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:40.166
Those killer strings!
They're closing in!

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:48.650
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:07.220
[TOWNSMAN A] The strings're
cutting through those building

00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:11.095
like hot butter!
They're gonna fall!

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.165
[TOWNSMAN C]
Run away!

00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:19.912
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:30.834
[TOWNSMAN D] The edge of
the town isn't safe anymore!

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.274
[TOWNSMAN E]
Hurry! Faster! Faster!

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:35.544
[TOWNSGIRL A gasps]

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.584
[TOWNSMAN F]
Go downtown!

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.491
[MARINE A] We've got an
emergency here on the north end.

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.261
The Birdcage started
moving all of a sudden

00:07:44.294 --> 00:07:46.633
and everything's
getting shredded!

00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:51.776
[MARINE B]
Same thing here in the west!

00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:55.083
[MARINE C] Reporting from
Carta, in the east.

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:58.757
The Birdcage is moving
as the reports say!

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:07.708
[MARINE C] Everyone is fleeing
to downtown in a panic!

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:11.950
[DOFLAMINGO]
No one will survive.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.724
[DOFLAMINGO] They'll all be
butchered, sooner or later.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:22.004
Oh, I'm sorry.
The rules have changed.

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:24.609
I've decided to play
a different game now.

00:08:24.642 --> 00:08:27.615
[LUFFY] You're still
calling this a "game"?

00:08:30.453 --> 00:08:32.925
Just listen.

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.569
The Birdcage that surrounds
the kingdom started shrinking,

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.939
pulling in to
the center, bit by bit.

00:08:39.972 --> 00:08:41.141
[LUFFY gasps]

00:08:42.512 --> 00:08:47.054
[DOFLAMINGO] Think of it like a
giant umbrella, closing slowly.

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:48.255
[gasps]

00:08:57.107 --> 00:08:59.646
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.150
[DOFLAMINGO] It'll cut through
everything in its path.

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:04.221
The entire kingdom.

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:06.425
As for how long that'll take...

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:10.032
Well, about an hour, I'd say.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:18.784
[chuckles] They have nowhere
left to go. They're finished.

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:26.199
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.705
Run away! If you stay here,
you'll get cut up!

00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:32.512
Doflamingo!
This is your kingdom!

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:34.314
This is cruel! It's pure evil!

00:09:34.348 --> 00:09:36.486
Here it comes! Keep going!

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.788
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.792
Check for citizens at
the edge of the kingdom

00:09:39.826 --> 00:09:41.797
and bring them to
the center, quickly!

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.132
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:55.156
Need help?

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.562
Yes. Thank you, sir.

00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:59.432
The Birdcage is closing in.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.936
C'mon, we'll head downtown.

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:04.842
[MARINE H]
We moved the people at risk

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:08.315
from the edges of the kingdom,
but we have to keep going!

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:10.487
Let's go! Follow after me!

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:13.092
The strings are coming, hurry!

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:16.533
[PIRATE A] Hey, could
somebody untie us, please?

00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:18.937
Just the feet is fine, okay?

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.978
Have mercy! I don't wanna die!

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:26.719
[USOPP] What? The Birdcage
is shrinking? No!

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:29.191
Hey, Birdcage, stop it!

00:10:29.224 --> 00:10:30.995
It seems to be so.

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:31.663
Awful!

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:32.899
What should we do?

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:36.205
We've suffered enough
already! Zoro, help!

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:38.309
And we were winning
all our fights, too!

00:10:38.343 --> 00:10:42.083
You can't pull the rug
out from under us now!

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:44.254
[ALL gasp]

00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:45.123
We finally made it out of

00:10:45.156 --> 00:10:46.960
that dungeon after
all this time.

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:48.764
And now we're in a new cage?

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:52.170
There has to be someplace
safe we can run to!

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.208
How could he do
such a heartless thing?

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:57.213
Is there no depth you won't
sink to, Doflamingo?

00:10:57.247 --> 00:11:01.689
The Birdcage is gonna dice up
the whole kingdom at this rate!

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:04.461
We're all done for!
Our home, too!

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:11.743
[SAI] I'm seeing a lot of smoke
and hearing a lot of rumbling.

00:11:11.776 --> 00:11:14.281
There's no way this is good.

00:11:27.007 --> 00:11:29.645
At this point, I don't
know what we should do.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.386
Another rotten trick.
Should've expected this.

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.122
Doflamingo!

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:44.040
Hurry it up, Luffy!

00:11:44.074 --> 00:11:46.947
Just kick his ass and
get this mess over with!

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.282
You're our only hope!

00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:51.523
[KIN'EMON] Indeed!
Thwart him swiftly, my friend!

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:53.192
It must be difficult

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:56.666
to have so much resting
on one man's shoulders.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.739
[groans] Sir Luffy!

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.142
Please, prevail!

00:12:01.175 --> 00:12:04.982
Everyone will die
if you do not succeed!

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:10.827
[chuckles]

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:14.902
I won't spare a single
rotten life in this kingdom.

00:12:19.044 --> 00:12:21.816
[DOFLAMINGO] They aren't
worth a thing to me.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.186
Not since they
discovered the truth

00:12:23.219 --> 00:12:26.258
about how I've been
running this place.

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.550
[DOFLAMINGO] Every building,
every person, every animal.

00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:42.056
All your miserable
little allies.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.065
And finally, you will die.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.436
[laughs]

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.174
[laughs]

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:56.520
[DOFLAMINGO] Although I suppose
some of your friends

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.989
have died already.

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:01.529
The good doctor passed away
just a moment ago.

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.905
[DOFLAMINGO] So much for
your "pirate alliance"

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:08.476
with dear old "Traffy."

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.380
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:15.490
[TREBOL laughs] He was pathetic.
Wish you'd been here to see!

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:16.993
Oh, poor Law.

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:19.699
Dummy should've known better
than to mess with his old pals.

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.536
[TREBOL laughs]

00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:28.415
Dressrosa's last hour.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.256
[DOFLAMINGO]
Should be fun.

00:13:35.697 --> 00:13:38.937
Oh, but no need to
worry about me.

00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:41.510
I'll build a new kingdom.

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:42.978
Yeah? Screw that!

00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:45.818
All I gotta do is kick your ass
and everything'll be fine!

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:47.655
I'm starting to
think that you're

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:50.627
not paying attention
to me, Straw Hat.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.399
[gasps]

00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:59.444
[LUFFY yelling]

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.485
Now, Fallbright!

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:09.665
[DOFLAMINGO]
You never learn, do you?

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:11.334
Bullet String!

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:15.376
Gum-Gum...

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:19.484
Go ahead. You'll die
just like Law!

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:21.054
[LAW]
Shambles!

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:23.626
[DOFLAMINGO gasps]

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.500
[DOFLAMINGO]
Law?!

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:32.076
Sorry, but nobody's
dying here except you!

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.613
Go!

00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:38.088
[yelling]

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:46.539
This operation will destroy
your body from the inside out!

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:50.045
[groaning]

00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:52.951
Gamma Knife!

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:04.274
[DOFLAMINGO yells]

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:23.680
[groaning]

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.652
Gamma Knife!

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:37.942
[DOFLAMINGO yells]

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:40.981
[gasps] Doffy!

00:15:44.723 --> 00:15:45.991
Law!

00:15:46.024 --> 00:15:48.730
You were supposed to
be dead, you big cheater!

00:15:48.763 --> 00:15:50.534
And how can you do
an Op-Op attack

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:51.969
without making a Room?!

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:55.043
I did. We're in
a Room as we speak!

00:15:55.778 --> 00:15:58.717
[LAW] It'll shave some time
off my life, I'm sure,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.919
but I made a Room so big

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:02.925
that you can't see
the end of it from here.

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.664
What? But that's crazy!

00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:15.650
All I did was in preparation
for this moment!

00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:22.564
[LAW groans]

00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:30.312
[pants]

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:37.761
[LAW]
That wasn't enough to kill me!

00:16:37.795 --> 00:16:39.430
Shambles!

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.284
And the "Heart Pirates"?

00:16:49.318 --> 00:16:51.255
You think I didn't notice?

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:53.727
What're you trying to say here?

00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:57.668
[DOFLAMINGO] You refused
to accept the heart seat.

00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:01.475
Then you bear the mark
of the heart anyway?

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.513
Why?!

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:08.088
[LAW]
Sorry to have you take my place.

00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:11.395
[LAW]
I'll patch you up later.

00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:14.535
Doflamingo!

00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:16.806
And Shambles.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.242
[LUFFY gasps]

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:21.650
[gasps]

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.787
[LUFFY]
Hey. Traffy!

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.891
Where's all this
blood coming from?

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:27.227
Where'd your arm go?

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.700
[DOFLAMINGO]
What, you can't tell? He's dead.

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:37.213
Mingo!

00:17:37.882 --> 00:17:39.484
--[LAW] Wait.
--[gasps]

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:42.758
[LAW]
I'm alive.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:47.500
[LAW]
Listen carefully, Straw Hat.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:50.573
Don't turn around!
I have a plan!

00:18:00.827 --> 00:18:03.900
[LAW] You can't defend against
an attack from inside!

00:18:03.934 --> 00:18:07.406
[groaning]

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.487
[LAW] Even you can't
counteract this technique!

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:33.259
Doffy! You're a king!

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:36.766
A king never falls to his knees!

00:18:41.075 --> 00:18:43.513
You little bastard!

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:45.917
[LAW]
It's no use.

00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:48.690
Even if you kill me,
you're done for.

00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:56.906
You think I won't
kill you anyway?

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:00.312
[yells]

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.818
You forget about me?

00:19:04.087 --> 00:19:06.892
Now Gum-Gum Jet Stamp!

00:19:08.529 --> 00:19:11.870
[LUFFY yells]

00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:14.842
Oh no!

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:17.480
[groans]

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:22.958
Doffy! Are you okay?

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.572
This is all wrong!
There's no way!

00:19:29.606 --> 00:19:34.247
Our mighty king can't lose to
a pair of small-fries like them!

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.055
Want more?

00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:40.593
[LAW]
Straw Hat! Hold on!

00:19:56.993 --> 00:19:58.663
Traffy.

00:20:04.408 --> 00:20:07.380
[TREBOL laughs]
You can still climb the ladder

00:20:07.413 --> 00:20:08.517
even if you're a kid.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.320
As long as you
play your cards right,

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:11.656
Doffy'll promote you.

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:15.930
Just don't waste his
precious time. Best of luck!

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.770
[DIAMANTE]
Law, was it?

00:20:18.804 --> 00:20:22.678
This guy who just came back
is an Executive like us.

00:20:22.712 --> 00:20:24.347
His name is Corazon.

00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:26.852
He may come across as
a thick-headed clutz,

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:30.693
but truth is, he comes from
a powerful bloodline.

00:20:35.303 --> 00:20:36.939
[LAW]
Cora.

00:20:37.908 --> 00:20:42.217
[DOCTOR A] No, no! No!
The lead's gonna get us!

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.288
Please leave us alone,
you white monster!

00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:46.860
We don't want your
gross disease! Go away!

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:49.933
Give up. I'm getting sicker.

00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:51.502
I can't take anymore!

00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:55.042
Shut up! We'll find the cure.

00:20:58.015 --> 00:21:02.323
[ROSINANTE] You may have stabbed
me, you little shit. But...

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.635
It didn't hurt at all.

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:11.074
You were the one who was
actually suffering back then.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:15.683
I just wanted to
fix things for you, Law.

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:44.274
Let me do it.

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:46.712
Hey! Just take it easy!

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.528
[ROSINANTE]
Hey. Law?

00:21:56.197 --> 00:21:58.001
I love you, kid.

00:22:04.413 --> 00:22:09.758
It has to be...
me who does this.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:41.722
[LAW]
Room!

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:57.086
[LAW] Cora. I can finally
make your dream come true.

00:23:03.232 --> 00:23:06.705
[LAW]
It's over, Doflamingo!

00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:16.157
[NARRATOR]
Despite the deadly operation

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.295
that Doflamingo
received from Law,

00:23:18.328 --> 00:23:20.667
he refuses to submit to defeat.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.069
With Law at his limit,

00:23:22.103 --> 00:23:23.973
Luffy must carry
on in his stead,

00:23:24.007 --> 00:23:27.581
matching his Conqueror's spirit
against Doflamingo's own.

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:30.653
Now, the battle of
the ultimate Haki begins.

00:23:30.687 --> 00:23:32.557
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.297 --> 00:23:39.103
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
