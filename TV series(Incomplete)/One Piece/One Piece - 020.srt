didn't know what to do!

Maybe we'd just rest on a

112
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,228

of plant‐derived
nutrients like Vitamin C.

Back in the old days,

they couldn't carry fresh
fruits and vegetables

them. We know better now.

you're surprised...

[YOSAKU] We never imagined
that the pirate hunter Zoro

became a pirate himself.

Let this be a lesson to you.

153
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,535
[ZORO] Yeah. This is the
kind of trouble you run into

154
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,203
when you choose a
life on the sea.

155
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,738
[USOPP] Which means,
when we're at sea,

156
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,673
we really gotta think
about how we can get

157
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,610
the right amount of nutrients
with very little food.

158
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,246
It's absolutely necessary
that someone on this ship

159
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,780
knows how to do that.

160
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,252
[LUFFY]
It's necessary?

161
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,954
Right! The ship needs a cook!

I'm in! Good idea!

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,695
We'll have yummy food,
even while we're out at sea!

166
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,566
That's right.
You got it. Ha, ha!

00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,768
A cook? I know just the place.

And the food is gonna

This place is close
to the Grand Line.

And I've heard a lot
of rumors lately,

173
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:12,084
that a certain hawk‐eyed man
you're looking for is there.

174
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,621
Set a course.

A Marine ship?!

193
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,109
All the way out here?

194
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,183
Hey, Luffy. They're not gonna
start firing at us, are they?

195
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,653
It's just my luck! Of course
the marines would show up.

196
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,689
But. How did that ship...?

197
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,698
[FULLBODY] I've never
seen that pirate flag.

198

So, do you think he
knows that you and I

199
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,036
aren't a couple of pirates?

Ah...

But, you can just
call me "Sir"!

My name is Usopp.
Got it?!

206
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,256
We only made our flag
the day before yesterday!

That's right marine!
And I drew it!

Heh. You did?
Is that so...?

Hey! You two! Right there!
I've seen you before.

210
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,071
You're that bounty
hunter duo that goes

211
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,939
after the small fish, right?

212
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,341
Uh, well, we...

213
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,177
[FULLBODY] So, you've finally
been caught by pirates.

Huh?

He ignored us!

00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,379
Next time we see him,

227
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,414

more respect for us.

Hm. What are these things?

In other words, if we defeat
them, we get the reward money.

pointing a cannon right at us!

What are you trying to do?
Put me out of business?!

This is the guy!

didn't do this to my leg.

269

you've no choice but to work.

Fine. I wanna make it right!

280
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:20,019
Then you'll work, unpaid,
for a whole year.

00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,655
Right! I'll work,
unpaid, for a year!

the hook with that.

[NAMI]
Yeah...

287
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,813
[USOPP] They'll probably
make him work without pay

288
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,815
for like a whole month.

289
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,151
[NAMI] He should've just said
it was the Marine's fault

290
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,653
instead of being so
freakin' honest.

there is Lieutenant Fullbody.

from the soil of Micquo
of the North Land.

taste isn't working today.

that the owner serve
that particular wine

and seriously injured the Head
Chef. That's a serious offense!

You can't just settle that up

with one or two
weeks of unpaid work!

Is "bug soup" on the menu today,
or did you make it just for me?

That's right. What's this
bug doing there, waiter?
