WEBVTT

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:30.347
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.018
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.422
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.325
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.358 --> 00:01:38.531
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.270
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:43.360
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:45.263
as the New World.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.270
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.775
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.044
they held.

00:02:52.077 --> 00:02:53.915
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.289
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:03.132
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.671
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.045
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.484
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be
the King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:19.933
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:23.440
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:25.978
Their current objective is
to destroy a man-made

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:29.485
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.389
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:33.961
at the Corrida Colosseum
with the Flame-Flame fruit

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:36.767
as the prize, he decides
to join and compete

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.173
against titanic contenders
from all over the New World.

00:03:58.043 --> 00:03:59.813
Fujitora?

00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:01.884
Pardon the intrusion.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.021
Why did you save him?

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:06.059
It had to be done,
Heavenly Demon.

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:07.562
I have my orders.

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:09.364
I didn't come here to kill him.

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:13.574
My objective is to
only apprehend him.

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:19.018
Oh, also, that question
you asked me,

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.024
about controlling
the government?

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:23.392
I'll tell you.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.374
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:07.181
Eight centuries ago.

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:10.487
That's how far back
this little story begins.

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:11.556
Law.

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:18.002
Eight hundred years ago,
20 kings from 20 countries

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:20.675
met at the center of the world.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:24.649
They formed an alliance and
became a single organization.

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:27.521
Today, we know it as
the World Government.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.863
The kings who created
this governing body

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:35.036
decided to move to the
Holyland of Marie Jois

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.776
and live there with
their families.

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.416
There was only one, the
Nefertari Family of Alabasta,

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.555
that refused to reside
in the capital.

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.927
The descendants
of those 19 creators

00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:48.731
still dwelling in the city

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:51.703
control nearly the entire
world and go by

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:54.509
the title of Celestial Dragons.

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:58.517
However, we can't forget
this agreement 800 years ago

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.026
also cost 19 kingdoms to
lose their royal families.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.330
You following along?

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:07.702
Out of necessity,
the countries needed to select

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:11.843
new kings to govern and
replace the missing rulers.

00:06:11.876 --> 00:06:15.450
For instance, in the case
of my native Dressrosa,

00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:17.655
the Riku Family was
selected to govern

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.692
over the island.

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:21.763
And the old royalty
who chose to move

00:06:21.796 --> 00:06:25.504
to the Holyland of Marie
Jois all those years ago.

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.779
The Don Quixote Family!

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:32.952
Then all this time,
you were a...

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:35.691
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:43.106
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.444
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:47.080
Now this is the life!

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:49.786
Nothing like fabulous
tunes on a sea of art!

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.855
Oh, yeah!

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.090
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:54.162
You know culture
when you see it!

00:06:54.195 --> 00:06:55.632
Turn the ship around!

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.936
Don't tell me we're
going to Green Bit!

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:01.442
[laughs]
Imagine the look on Law's face!

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.213
Should be a shock
when he sees it's not you

00:07:03.246 --> 00:07:05.450
that's coming to
collect Caesar, but moi!

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:07.856
I don't get why Brook
is acting so weird!

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.526
Why did he turn against us?

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:10.695
There's no way!

00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:13.099
A true swordsman would
never betray his friends!

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:16.072
[BROOK] Yo ho!
I've simply reawakened my true

00:07:16.105 --> 00:07:17.407
artistic nature.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.113
Bringing forth new creations
is my only reason for living.

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:23.153
Despite the fact I myself
am very dead, of course.

00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:24.523
Sing it!

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:27.093
These peasants can't
understand us, Soul King!

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:29.498
We only want
to express ourselves!

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.605
They'll never know our passion!

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:35.678
Life is the greatest art!
Dying art!

00:07:35.712 --> 00:07:39.252
[BROOK] Simply fantastic, Miss
Giolla! Yo ho ho ho!

00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:40.420
Is not!

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:41.957
Someone help me!

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.194
I'm fine. Doesn't hurt. Really.

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:46.265
[GIOLLA]
I'm moved beyond tears!

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:48.671
Look how I've exquisitely
depicted the tragedy

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:49.973
of Dressrosa!

00:07:50.006 --> 00:07:51.943
In about ten minutes,
these rubes will be

00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:54.716
completely fused with
my latest masterpiece.

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.158
Choking to death and
turning into a still life!

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:00.126
What'd she say?!

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.130
Do something, Brook!

00:08:02.164 --> 00:08:03.600
Get us out of here!

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:05.370
[BROOK]
It's simply splendid!

00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:07.975
You must let me compose
a song for your exhibit!

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:10.682
If you did, the honor would
be all mine, Soul King!

00:08:10.715 --> 00:08:12.350
[BROOK]
Then it's a deal!

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:15.423
But first, could you change
my violin and bow back?

00:08:15.456 --> 00:08:18.162
[GIOLLA] You got it!
Take it away, brother!

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.906
[BROOK]
Wow! You miracle worker you!

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:24.408
[NAMI]
I can't breathe!

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:26.780
I'm not suffering... much.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.022
I've almost lost consciousness.

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:33.259
I don't want to die like this.

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:35.096
Like to see
something interesting?

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.236
You'll notice my violin bow
is actually a sword, Giolla.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:41.275
[GIOLLA]
Enough talk, play me some music.

00:08:41.308 --> 00:08:44.983
[BROOK humming]

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:47.622
[BROOK]
I decided to cut you instead.

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:48.624
What's that?

00:08:48.657 --> 00:08:50.528
My Painting Song.

00:08:50.562 --> 00:08:52.063
Bamboo Flute Slice!

00:08:52.096 --> 00:08:53.867
[GIOLLA screams]

00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:00.882
You must forgive me.
I don't know art.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:03.386
One look and I thought
it was clear.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.060
After all...
I don't have the eyes for it!

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:08.897
[CHOPPER, NAMI]
Brook!

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.601
[MOMONOSUKE]
Sir Skeleton!

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:12.672
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:09:12.705 --> 00:09:14.976
[CROWD cheers]

00:09:21.856 --> 00:09:25.163
I was worried about Nami
long before you ever were!

00:09:25.196 --> 00:09:26.967
And if she wants anyone
to come save her,

00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:28.570
it's definitely me!

00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:30.675
So you let me handle this!

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:33.045
Then get going already!

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:34.381
Kin'emon.

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:37.588
Take this map to the Toy House
where your friend is being held.

00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:39.191
[KIN'EMON]
I'm eternally grateful!

00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:42.364
[SANJI]
When you see Luffy again,

00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:44.569
contact the Sunny using this.

00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:47.107
We need to check
everyone's situation.

00:09:47.141 --> 00:09:48.577
I'll stay aboard the ship.

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:55.524
So.
Any ideas how we reach him?

00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:57.394
If I knew, do you think
we'd be standing here

00:09:57.427 --> 00:10:00.100
with our arms folded?

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.139
The place has been
completely sealed off.

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:06.278
And I don't see anyone
to let us in.

00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:08.249
We should also avoid suspicion,

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.587
since I was nearly
arrested earlier.

00:10:10.621 --> 00:10:12.792
[ZORO] Cool, so I'll just
cut down the wall?

00:10:12.826 --> 00:10:15.698
I said be discreet!

00:10:15.732 --> 00:10:17.535
I'll do it quietly?

00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:19.506
Boy! That's not the point!

00:10:19.539 --> 00:10:21.074
[ZORO]
So, not quietly?

00:10:23.813 --> 00:10:29.224
[BOTH arguing]

00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:32.096
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.138
That's the legendary "Pirate
Hunter" Roronoa Zoro!

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:39.178
They say he chopped up
100 men in Whiskey Peak.

00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:41.015
Sliced and diced
everything in his path

00:10:41.048 --> 00:10:42.084
at Enies Lobby!

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:45.691
He's the Master of
the Three Sword Style!

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:47.562
He's the Straw Hats' first mate!

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.097
Luffy's right hand man!

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.001
Even without Devil Fruit powers,

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.672
he's a monster
on the battlefield!

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:54.776
He looks so cool in person!

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:56.647
The tears, they won't stop.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.750
My heart is overflowing!

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:01.188
[BARTOLOMEO crying]

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:06.265
I love you, Zoro!

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:09.171
[KIN'EMON]
Do you know that man?

00:11:09.205 --> 00:11:11.208
Thankfully I don't.

00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:17.354
[LUFFY]
Yeah! You got this, Rebecca!

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:18.758
Again!

00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:21.596
There's another guy
she totally dropped!

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:23.700
Ha! She's amazing!

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.805
He's really into this, isn't he?

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:26.907
[INMATE C]
Mm.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.812
You rule! Kick his ass!

00:11:36.793 --> 00:11:39.030
I'm so glad to be back
to my old self!

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.335
I don't know how
to thank you, Brook!

00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:44.107
Truly, I couldn't have
said it better myself.

00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:45.945
I am overwhelmed with joy.

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:47.314
No joke.

00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:49.586
I thought I was gonna
die back there too.

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:51.523
You saved our lives, Brook.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.594
No need to make
a big deal of it.

00:11:53.627 --> 00:11:55.665
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:11:55.698 --> 00:11:57.868
But if you insist,
then that's fine too!

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.741
Commence the
sleep-on-Nami's-lap party!

00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:03.313
The party's been cancelled!

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.684
So. No afterparty then?

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.391
[NAMI]
Back to business.

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:11.495
All right, Brook,
you're gonna have cuff her.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.531
Go ahead.

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:14.702
That's my thanks for saving you?

00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:17.407
I'm not going anywhere near
those shackles, Nami!

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.877
They drain all my energy.

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:21.015
[NAMI] Stop complaining
and get it over with!

00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:23.052
[BROOK] You're the only
one here who hasn't eaten

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:25.090
a Devil Fruit, so it
only makes sense.

00:12:25.123 --> 00:12:26.693
Stop arguing and do it!

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:27.895
[GROUP yells]

00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:31.603
I was mistaken.

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.239
[GROUP yells]

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:35.678
[GIOLLA] I shoulda never
trusted you, Soul King!

00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:37.281
How could you?

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.451
Deceiving me like that?

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:41.121
I only dropped my guard
because I thought

00:12:41.154 --> 00:12:44.228
we were two artists
who really connected!

00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:47.000
It obvious you people
have zero taste!

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.204
So I'll just have to imprint
my ultimate masterwork

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.408
on your minds to elevate you!

00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:54.481
Straight up to the afterlife
where the four of you belong!

00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:57.487
G-Giolla. Please. Try and relax.

00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.092
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:13:09.512 --> 00:13:12.951
[GIOLLA]
Presenting Heaven's Door Art!

00:13:23.506 --> 00:13:24.542
What the hell?

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.311
More like where
the hell, amirite?

00:13:26.344 --> 00:13:28.783
--[GIOLLA laughs]
--[GROUP yells]

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:41.007
[BROOK]
What?

00:14:09.497 --> 00:14:12.103
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:17.447
You will witness the pinnacle
of my strength!

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.386
Heaven's Door Art
is my masterpiece!

00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:27.400
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:29.471
You see?

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:31.442
Isn't the world a much
lovelier place now

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:32.845
that it's made of art?

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:34.348
You should be thanking
me for giving you

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:36.185
this opportunity!

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:37.655
The last thing you're
going to see before

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:40.326
you die happens to be
the most beautiful!

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.265
[laughing]

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:09.619
[BABY 5]
Come on, Gladius.

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.623
Why don't you try
and settle down?

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:13.426
[GLADIUS]
I can't, Baby 5.

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:15.831
Or perhaps you're blind to just
how much her betrayal

00:15:15.864 --> 00:15:18.937
has completely derailed
our well-laid plans.

00:15:21.175 --> 00:15:23.045
The idea was simple.

00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:26.820
That woman, Violet, would
capture Black Leg Sanji.

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:30.125
Then search his mind and extract
the enemy's strategies.

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:35.571
Afterwards we'd be able
to predict their every move

00:15:35.604 --> 00:15:37.975
and eliminate them one by one.

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:40.112
But what does she do instead?

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:42.518
Wipes out her own men
and runs off with him!

00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:44.789
[BABY 5]
Chill out!

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:46.626
You aren't gonna explode
here, are you?

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.243
[GLADIUS] If there's one thing
I absolutely loathe,

00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:58.348
it's people who can't stick
to a time or a plan!

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.196
[glass shatters]

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:24.702
[GLADIUS]
No one betrays us.

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.706
She was disloyal
to the Young Master

00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:29.879
and must pay with her life.

00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:33.821
Violet was acting strange
as far back as last night.

00:16:33.854 --> 00:16:35.524
Think about it, Baby.

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:38.095
With Violet's All-Seeing-Eye,
she should have easily

00:16:38.129 --> 00:16:40.700
been able to find the
Straw Hats' ship yesterday.

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:53.627
You're not supposed to be
riding this steed with me!

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.330
I told you to wait back
at the harbor,

00:16:55.363 --> 00:16:58.035
you naughty girl! Oh ho ho!

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.943
[VIOLET] I would, but it's
crawling with Marines.

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.680
You and your friends
may want to rethink

00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:05.015
your rendezvous point.

00:17:06.686 --> 00:17:09.157
So. The Navy's here too.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.629
I count four battleships total.

00:17:11.662 --> 00:17:13.934
That means there are
at least 3,000 Marines

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:16.472
scattered across
the city as we speak.

00:17:16.506 --> 00:17:20.313
And you found all that out in
such a short amount of time?

00:17:20.346 --> 00:17:23.385
It's one of my abilities.
Clairvoyance.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.660
My All-Seeing Eye has a
range of up to 2,500 miles

00:17:26.693 --> 00:17:28.061
and allows me to survey
the land from the

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:30.266
point of view
of a bird in flight.

00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:53.012
From this very spot,

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:57.420
I can see everything going
on in Dressrosa.

00:17:57.453 --> 00:18:00.561
Bottom line, you don't need
to worry about my safety.

00:18:00.594 --> 00:18:02.564
There isn't a person
alive who can catch me.

00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:06.840
Does that mean you're
gonna stay in this country?

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:09.946
[VIOLET] No, there's
nothing to worry about.

00:18:09.979 --> 00:18:11.515
But what I am going to do is...

00:18:13.352 --> 00:18:14.689
What is it, Violet?

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:16.291
There's something wrong.

00:18:16.324 --> 00:18:19.832
I should be able to see your
ship, but it's simply not there!

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.301
Like it disappeared?

00:18:25.777 --> 00:18:30.085
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:35.129
What should we do, Nami?
What do we do?

00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:36.699
I don't know what we can do!

00:18:41.576 --> 00:18:43.311
No choice but to fight!

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.894
Launching Weather egg now!

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:53.966
Hatch for me, Little Bolt!

00:19:00.379 --> 00:19:02.083
Let's see you
critique this storm!

00:19:02.116 --> 00:19:05.222
I can't stand such lowbrow work!

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:09.430
[NAMI]
What?

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.203
Your technique is unrefined.

00:19:12.237 --> 00:19:13.606
It lacks style and depth,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.877
but perhaps I'll be
able to help out!

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:19.551
If I were the artist,
I'd do something like this.

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:23.893
A more defined shape.

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:25.229
That's my cloud!

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:31.375
And add glowing neon to
accentuate the thunderbolt!

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:33.445
[NAMI screams]

00:19:33.478 --> 00:19:35.382
[BROOK screams]

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:40.928
Way to go, Brook!

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:42.363
Huh?!

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:44.702
You don't mind if I edit
your artwork a little,

00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:46.204
do you, Giolla?

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.978
[BROOK yelling]

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.687
[BROOK]
Yo ho! Yo ho!

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.457
[GIOLLA laughing]

00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:58.797
This piece is imbued
with my soul!

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.633
The statement behind
"Heaven's Door Art"

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.771
is about the artist's pursuit
to represent nothing

00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:04.808
less than ultimate beauty!

00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:06.746
And everyone knows
the greatest beauty

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:09.150
is also the strongest!

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:13.826
The Cola barrels
have been set in place!

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.395
Nice going, Chopper!

00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:19.003
What exactly is this thing?

00:20:19.037 --> 00:20:21.375
The Sunny's power source.

00:20:21.408 --> 00:20:23.546
With this we can fire
the Gaon Cannon!

00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:25.215
[MOMONOSUKE]
Sounds powerful!

00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:31.194
[NAMI]
If I remember correctly,

00:20:31.227 --> 00:20:33.866
I just have to aim the circle
over where I want to shoot.

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:37.139
I kinda wish Usopp
was here right now.

00:20:37.172 --> 00:20:39.545
But with a target this big,
I don't think I can miss!

00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:44.220
Get clear, Brook!
I'm ready to fire!

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:46.892
Just a moment, please!
Yo ho ho ho!

00:20:58.583 --> 00:20:59.986
[BROOK]
Okay. Done.

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:02.825
All right! Here we go!

00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:04.160
Gaon Cannon!

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:08.068
Fire!

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.942
Oh, that won't do!

00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:24.066
[GIOLLA yells]

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:43.539
[GIOLLA yells]

00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:47.647
Got ya!

00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:59.104
[GIOLLA laughs]

00:21:59.137 --> 00:22:01.374
You think I'd simply let
you escape after you

00:22:01.408 --> 00:22:03.278
destroyed my masterpiece?

00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.815
How'd she survive that blast?

00:22:04.848 --> 00:22:07.253
Just go away!

00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:09.157
You've really pissed me off now!

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.994
Don't expect a show of mercy!

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:17.641
So, whoever's ready to die
first can step right up.

00:22:17.674 --> 00:22:19.545
[MOMONOSUKE yells]

00:22:19.579 --> 00:22:21.147
Head blow!

00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:28.462
You're gonna suffer for that,
you damn brat!

00:22:28.495 --> 00:22:29.865
Stand aside, Momo!

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.706
[GIOLLA yells]

00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:38.749
What's wrong?

00:22:38.783 --> 00:22:39.752
It's bad.

00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:41.989
Seems your ship emerged
out of nowhere,

00:22:42.022 --> 00:22:43.727
and then was hit by lightning!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.128
Hit by lightning?

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:48.335
Then Nami must be safe.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.412
Oh, my.

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:56.719
All these swirling colors--
This is truly avant garde.

00:22:58.322 --> 00:23:00.026
You did it, Momonosuke!

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:01.562
I suppose that I did!

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:06.104
Nothing to fear at all!

00:23:14.722 --> 00:23:16.960
[NARRATOR] As the fierce
competitors of Block D continue

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:19.497
to clash, hoping to win
the coveted prize,

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:21.168
one man steals the
spotlight away from

00:23:21.201 --> 00:23:22.771
all of them.

00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:24.474
This spectacular figure
is known as

00:23:24.509 --> 00:23:26.377
"Pirate Noble" Cavendish.

00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:30.385
And soon, he will brandish his
mighty blade of sheer beauty!

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:32.290
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:35.697
"Beautiful Sword!
Cavendish of the White Horse!"

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.934
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
