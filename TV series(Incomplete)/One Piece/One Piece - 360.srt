1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,032
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,331
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:50,378
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,257
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,635
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,888
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,516
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,477
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,731
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,320
Damn straight.
For starters, you're a thief.

48
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,364
You stole Nami
and you stole my dream.

49
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,949
Who the hell are you?

50
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,826
What're you talking about?

51
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,745
My dream. I saw it so clearly.

52
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,581
I could do so much good with it.
Use it to protect...

53
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,498
...nude girls!

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,251
No, I mean, I could help
all mankind and...

55
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,377
...nude girls!

56
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,380
No, I had this beautiful vision
of the future and...

57
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
...nude girls!

58
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,883
[ABSALOM]
Mystery Man Handler!

59
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,593
Mystery Man Kicker!

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,846
[ABSALOM]
Let go of me, dammit!

61
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,348
[SANJI]
I've got you now, you bastard.

62
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,390
[ABSALOM]
Let go!

63
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,478
With all the different animals
you've got stitched into you,

64
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,397
you're gonna make
one damn tasty casserole.

65
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,987
[SANJI]
Extra Hachi!

66
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,953
Rookie pirates. So cocky.

67
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,579
You fools are just
setting yourselves up

68
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,456
for your own humiliation.

69
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,334
Bastard!

70
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,044
You've really pissed me off!

71
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,921
Gum-Gum....

72
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,756
He jumped!

73
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,093
Is he trying to escape?
What a coward!

74
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,970
[LUFFY]
...Stamp!

75
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,478
You brat! What a cheap shot!

76
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,773
Ha! Your ass just got kicked!

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,024
How 'bout that?

78
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,025
Alright, then,

79
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,319
it's time to teach
that ghost girl a lesson.

80
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,447
Yep, a lesson in
complete and total defeat.

81
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,410
What the...? She was right here.

82
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,496
[PERONA]
Looking for me? Right this way.

83
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,664
Horo horo horo!

84
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,332
[USOPP]
Is this some kinda trick?

85
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,794
Where is she?
Did she go outside?

86
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,087
No, that can't be right.

87
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,090
This tower's so high
that she'd have to be...

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:05,430
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

89
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,764
Oh, and by the way.

90
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,641
I know how to beat you now.

91
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,352
And when I'm through with you,
your friends are next.

92
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,770
They won't have
a chance in the world!

93
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,856
Oh, come on! What the hell?

94
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,735
And everything
was going so good!

95
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,030
[LUFFY]
"Save Me, Hero!

96
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,907
My Enemy is
the Immortal Princess."

97
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,941
That hurt, you damn brat!

98
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,736
But you're gonna hurt worse!
You hear me?

99
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,749
I hear you.

100
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,543
But I'm still gonna
kick your ugly ass.

101
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,836
[LUFFY]
And here it comes!

102
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,047
Gum-Gum Stamp!

103
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,549
[MORIA]
Kushishi!

104
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,177
Hey! Let go, dammit!

105
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,804
Fine! As you wish.

106
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,597
Go, my Brick Bats!

107
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,143
This again?

108
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,107
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

109
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,150
...Finger Net!

110
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,620
Kushishishi!

111
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,542
This is pointless.

112
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,111
Okay. You're flying.

113
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,114
That's not what I expected.

114
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,284
[USOPP] You're awful
brave all of a sudden.

115
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,244
I had you running
scared a minute ago.

116
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,622
Where did all this
confidence come from, huh?

117
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,917
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

118
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,921
Horo horo horo!

119
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,133
I just got a little nervous
back there and I panicked.

120
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,020
[PERONA] What is this?
What kind of power have you got?

121
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,192
I just naturally have
a negative personality!

122
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:10,072
What?

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,450
[PERONA] I never dreamt
that there could be a person

124
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,621
so inherently negative that
they'd be immune to my ghosts.

125
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,081
And there's only
one thing I have to say

126
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,708
to such a person.

127
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,294
Cheer up, life is good!

128
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,128
Oh shut up!

129
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,715
You really think
that you're safe from me

130
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,550
just 'cuz you can fly,
little girl?

131
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,885
You're dealing with a sniper!

132
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,221
Flying or dancing,
it makes no difference to me!

133
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,056
[USOPP]
Allow me to explain.

134
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,266
This is my new weapon, Kabuto.

135
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,228
It features five pivots for
enhanced stability and reach,

136
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,855
and the breath dial I got
from Sky Island activates

137
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,566
the precise moment
that I take my shot,

138
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,236
allowing me to spin the
ammo in any direction I desire

139
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,697
so there's no escaping
this super sling-shot!

140
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,991
[USOPP]
Flame, flash, impact.

141
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,117
I've got every dial I need,

142
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,246
and each one makes my
shots stronger than the last!

143
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,040
[USOPP] You're as good as gone
once I've got you in my sights!

144
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,670
Now prepare yourself for...

145
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,089
[USOPP]
Hey, wait, she's gone already!

146
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,049
What the hell? What happened?

147
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,300
Where did she go?

148
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,261
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

149
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,887
Right behind you.

150
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,934
[USOPP screaming]

151
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,688
Go on, try to hit me.
I've made it easy for you.

152
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,775
[USOPP screaming]

153
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,986
What the hell kind
of monster are you?

154
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,823
Horo horo horo!
Horo horo horo!

155
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,950
No matter. Here goes!

156
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,618
Butterfly Meteor!

157
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,914
What? She's back
to her normal size?

158
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:46,752
[PERONA] Horo horo horo!
Horo horo horo!

159
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,255
Why you... Fine.
Try and fly away from this!

160
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,923
Mantis Meteor!

161
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,175
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

162
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,302
Is something wrong?

163
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,263
I thought that super sling-shot
of yours never missed?

164
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,266
Horo horo horo!

165
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,185
[USOPP]
Molotov Cocktail! Gas!

166
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,814
Barrier! Butterfly!
Arrow! Blazing Meteor!

167
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:28,127
[USOPP screaming]

168
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,174
[USOPP]
Your hands...

169
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,176
You stabbed them
right through my chest!

170
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,928
[USOPP]
They're inside me!

171
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,015
It hurts so much
I can't even feel it!

172
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,185
I'm gonna bleed to
death! Stop! Don't!

173
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,231
That's it!
I'm a dead man! I'm done for!

174
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,484
Idiot. Look a little closer.

175
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,152
My hands are inside you.

176
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,196
But your skin's
not even punctured.

177
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,698
You aren't hurt at all... yet.

178
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,705
Horo horo horo!

179
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,042
I see the horror of this
situation has sunk in.

180
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,001
Let me reassure you

181
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,420
that you are still
on the verge of death.

182
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,718
Do you feel it?

183
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm mere inches away

184
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,389
from wrapping my
fingers around your heart

185
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,891
and squeezing it until it pops.

186
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,810
I'm begging you.

187
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,395
Please don't make my heart pop!

188
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,397
I don't wanna...
I don't wanna die!

189
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,942
But you are going to die.

190
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:38,989
Now, writhe in
beautiful agony, and die.

191
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,913
[USOPP]
Please stop! Don't do it!

192
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,958
Please! No, I don't want to...

193
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,005
[USOPP]
...die.

194
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,886
Yeah, I can't
actually do any of that.

195
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,263
You were bluffing?

196
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,392
[USOPP]
You made me hurt my head!

197
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,435
[PERONA]
Come on! Just think about it.

198
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,437
If I could actually
crush your heart like that,

199
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,479
you'd have been dead the moment

200
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,857
I stuck my hands
inside your chest.

201
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,946
It's still gotta
be bad for my heart.

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,953
[PERONA] My hands didn't
even really touch your chest.

203
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,580
They just passed
right through it.

204
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,125
Nooooo!!!

205
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,335
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

206
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:38,966
Even though my body might
look just as solid as yours,

207
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,801
I can pass through
anything you can think of

208
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,511
as if there was nothing there.

209
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,477
Special Attack Viper Star Six!

210
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,816
[giggles]

211
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,327
[PERONA] You weren't
listening to me, were you?

212
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,916
Please stop it!
This is just gross!

213
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,584
[PERONA]
If I can pass through anything,

214
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,128
what makes you think
your attacks will hit me?

215
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,883
[USOPP]
Get back! Get away from me!

216
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,134
Go away, damn you!

217
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,845
Leave me alone,
you're freaking me out!

218
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,227
What's your plan now?

219
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,897
You can't harm me with
any of your feeble attacks.

220
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,024
[USOPP]
Shut up! If you were...

221
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,400
If you were
only bluffing earlier

222
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,653
when you threatened
to crush my heart,

223
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,530
And you were, then that means,

224
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,990
as big as you talk,
you can't even touch me!

225
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,661
[USOPP] I might not be
able to attack you,

226
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,998
but you can't attack me
either! Isn't that right?

227
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,291
[PERONA]
Mini Hollow.

228
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,294
What're ya gonna do with those?

229
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,424
And... Ghost Rap.

230
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,889
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

231
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,896
A... A shockwave.

232
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,401
[USOPP]
Get off me, go away!

233
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,070
Get off, you tiny
exploding ghost thing!

234
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:27,074
Ghost Rap.

235
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,909
Horo horo horo!

236
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,585
[USOPP]
Why, you...

237
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,254
Special Attack. Firebird Star!

238
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,096
[USOPP]
Damn it!

239
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,473
This is so not fair!

240
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,350
None of my attacks can touch her

241
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,562
but she can hurt me with
the snap of her fingers?

242
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,605
I'm not sticking
around for this!

243
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,191
[PERONA]
Horohorohoro!

244
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,484
Get out of the way!

245
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,611
I can't see with you there!

246
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,695
Move it!

247
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,863
[USOPP]
Move!

248
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,328
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

249
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,672
And Ghost Rap!

250
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:35,476
[explosions and USSOP's screams]

251
00:15:50,866 --> 00:16:01,919
[heavy footsteps]

252
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,338
[KUMACY]
That was a dirty move.

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,928
I'm even more mad
than I was before.

254
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,806
[PERONA]
Ghost Rap.

255
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:19,061
[USOPP screaming]

256
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
[PERONA giggling]

257
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:38,789
[heavy footsteps]

258
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,917
[USOPP thinking]
I should've known better.

259
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,294
It's just one embarrassment
after another.

260
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,840
[heavy footsteps]

261
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,591
[USOPP thinking]
I'm pathetic.

262
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,012
That's what I get for
thinking I had the upper hand.

263
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,973
[KUMACY]
Ta-da!

264
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,976
[USOPP]
The bear?

265
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,144
I'd be careful!

266
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,272
Kumacy is much stronger
than the average bear, you know.

267
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,362
[USOPP thinking]
This is impossible.

268
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,240
No one in our crew stands
a chance against this girl.

269
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,034
So why did I think I would?

270
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,077
[USOPP]
And why'd I have to go bragging

271
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,329
that only I can take her down?

272
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,540
[USOPP]
No matter how strong you are,

273
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,333
you don't stand
a chance against her.

274
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,085
All you can do is run.

275
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,128
But don't worry.

276
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,838
I'll take care of her for you!

277
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,860
[USOPP thinking] I thought
this was my moment to shine.

278
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,945
And then of course,
this happens.

279
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,658
[USOPP thinking]
I can't do this. I just can't!

280
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,870
There's no way I can win!

281
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,455
I'm a goner for sure.

282
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,582
And then that girl's
gonna capture everyone else

283
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,210
and completely
wipe out our crew!

284
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,092
[USOPP thinking] I thought
I could save them for once,

285
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,052
and now I need saving.

286
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,640
[USOPP thinking]
Please help me!

287
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,565
[USOPP thinking]
Save me!

288
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,609
Sniper King!

289
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,239
[USOPP thinking]
Tell me, Sniper King.

290
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,990
What would you do here?

291
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,210
Kumacy!

292
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,674
Bastard! How dare you
harm my sweet Kumacy!

293
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,470
And what the hell's with
that stupid mask you got on?

294
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,432
You're looking at
the face of your doom.

295
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,059
It's a pleasure to meet you.

296
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,603
I am the one and
only Sniper King.

297
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
You're the exact same guy!

298
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,315
You're just wearing a dumb mask!

299
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,151
[USOPP]
Gotta go!

300
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,236
[PERONA]
You're just gonna run away?

301
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,405
[USOPP]
Of course I'm running!

302
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,614
What the hell's the point
of fighting a fight

303
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,284
I know I can't win?

304
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,745
I've survived my whole
life on bluffs and negativity.

305
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,664
And I am at a
complete and utterloss

306
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,000
without those
tools working for me.

307
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,628
[SOGEKING]
So you're going to give up?

308
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,716
[SOGEKING] Calm down!
You have to fight, Usopp!

309
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,177
[USOPP] Shut up!
I've given all I've got!

310
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,345
There's no way
I can win against her!

311
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,638
[SOGEKING]
You know that's not true!

312
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,141
I know you're the kind
of man who can win this!

313
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,435
[USOPP] What history
are you basing that on?

314
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,187
[SOGEKING]
None.

315
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,731
[USOPP]
That is terrible motivation!

316
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,149
Mini Hollow.

317
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,694
[SOGEKING] Regardless,
think carefully, Usopp.

318
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,447
Don't you find
her behavior a little odd?

319
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,324
[USOPP]
Yeah, that's been buggin' me.

320
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,076
Especially how she got so
confident all of a sudden.

321
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,494
She was completely
terrified of me

322
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,413
and running for
her life back there.

323
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,211
[USOPP] If she was impervious
to my attacks all along,

324
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,005
there was no point
in running from me like that.

325
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,964
She could've just flown away

326
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,342
or walked right through
one of the walls.

327
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,760
[USOPP]
But she didn't.

328
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,094
All she did was run away

329
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,804
screaming at the
top of her lungs.

330
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,557
What was she freaking out
about if I couldn't hit her?

331
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,683
[USOPP]
That's it!

332
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,352
[PERONA]
Rap! Rap!

333
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,106
[USOPP]
Everything about her changed

334
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,691
the moment I lost sight of her.

335
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,364
[USOPP] So the question
is... what happened?

336
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,704
Horo horo horo!

337
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,213
Try to remember.

338
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,802
[USOPP] I got wrapped up
in dealing with that

339
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,428
stupid zombie bear.

340
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,223
And that's when it happened.

341
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,641
Right when I lost sight of her.

342
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,561
[USOPP]
But what was it?

343
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,856
Horo horo horo!

344
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,609
Well, I guess I better
hand you over to Moria now.

345
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,782
[USOPP thinking]
That's it! I've got it!

346
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,706
[USOPP]
Look carefully.

347
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,667
There's gotta be
someplace to hide around here.

348
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,426
[USOPP] Like a trap door
or a hidden room.

349
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,098
A room!

350
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,272
[USOPP] I've got you.
I'm on to your tricks.

351
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,648
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

352
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,734
[PERONA] What?
Are those your last words?

353
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,612
Wait! Stop!

354
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,448
What do you think
you're aiming at?

355
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,451
[USOPP]
That.

356
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,202
No, hang on!

357
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,829
[USOPP]
Special Attack: Atlas Comet!

358
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,665
[USOPP]
Just as I expected.

359
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,506
There it is. I've found
your real body, Ghost Girl!

360
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,857
[USOPP]
No enemy can hide from it!

361
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,359
Usopp Eye!

362
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,902
No enemy can overcome it!

363
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,404
Usopp Weapon!

364
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,571
And of course,

365
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,324
no situation is too hopeless
to thwart its brilliance,

366
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,410
Usopp Brain!

367
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,371
Take me seriously
or you're bound to get hurt.

368
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,705
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

369
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,541
"Perona is Terrified!

370
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,377
Usopp and Untruthful
share the same 'U.'"

371
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,754
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
