00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:04.004
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:07.040
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.743
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:11.945
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.147
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.950
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.252
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.121
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.657
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.696
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.826
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.662
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:47.901
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.470
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.673
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.575
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.011
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.580
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:05.385
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:06.886
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.723
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.928
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:20.233
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.735
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.839
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.907
Save us!

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.209
[ALL gasp]

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.944
[NAMI]
What does he mean by that?

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.346
Help us get out
of here! I beg you!

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.348
[DOLAN, BIYO]
Please, Miss!

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.016
[NARRATOR]
Nami and her group are captured

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.185
and brought to a
mysterious facility.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.754
There, they meet a group of
children who are desperate

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:42.855
to escape.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.059
[NAMI]
Damn it. We can't leave them.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:46.759
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.728
What the hell's gotten into you?

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.763
We don't even know
if they need saving!

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:51.864
We've just met these kids,

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.933
we don't know who they
are or why they're here!

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:57.070
It's not our job to help
everybody we meet!

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:04.644
[NAMI] I understand that, Sanji.
And I know it's risky.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:08.281
But there's no way that I can
turn my back on these children!

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.117
Not when we are their
only hope of getting help!

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.654
[LUFFY] All right, guys!
Let's head thatta way!

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:17.257
[HYOUTAURUS]
You're not getting away.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.659
Come back here!

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.394
[USOPP]
Ah, crap!

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.096
[ZORO]
Not that centaur again!

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.465
Now, Boss!

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:31.137
Finish off the intruders!
They're headed right for you!

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.973
[ZORO]
Guess that's... the Boss.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.076
[BROWNBEARD] There's a man among
them who's carrying swords.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.013
Is he the samurai who
attacked our people?

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.249
If so, I'll make him pay.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.752
[BROOK] Snow! Snow!
I like playin' in the snow!

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.320
'Specially when I have no--!

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.124
Ta-dah! Snow army!

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:54.294
[BROOK chuckles]
Now he looks just like me!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.967
[BROOK]
What the--? Hey!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.835
Show yourself fiend!

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.040
Huh?

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.676
What...?

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.048
[LUFFY]
"A Swordplay Showdown!

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:18.551
Brook versus the
Mysterious Torso Samurai!"

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.011
[MARINE C] There's nothin' but
ice as far as the eye can see.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.879
[MARINE B] Yeah, and there's no
point protectin' ourselves

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:49.582
from the gas if we
can't go ashore.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.552
[SMOKER] Don't give up, men.
Keep searching.

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.187
[MARINE C]
Whatever you say.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:57.924
[MARINES gasp]

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.425
[MARINE K]
An eruption?

00:06:06.632 --> 00:06:09.369
[MARINE A] There's somethin'
creepy about this place.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.772
It feels like we're bein'
watched by Akainu and Aokiji.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.542
[MARINE W gasps]
The thought gives me chills!

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.111
[MARINE X]
We should go back.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.087
[SMOKER]
Stop the ship at once.

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:32.125
[MARINE C]
Huh...? What's the matter?

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:32.859
[SMOKER]
Over there.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.594
[MARINE C]
Huh?

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.663
[TASHIGI]
Prepare the cannons! Fire!

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:53.913
[MARINE C]
That ain't gonna help,

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:55.748
it just nicked the surface.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:03.623
[MARINES gasp, shout]

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.237
[MARINES gasps]

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.908
[MARINE C gasps]
It's a river!

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:26.946
[MARINES chatter]

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:35.788
[MARINE D] Way to go, Smokey!
That was amazin'!

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.223
[MARINE E]
I can't believe it!

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.026
How'd ya know there was a
river behind that block of ice?

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.228
[MARINE F] That was pretty
impressive, Smokey.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.831
[MARINE G] It's like you've got
X-ray vision or somethin'!

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:53.573
[SMOKER] You can tell by looking
at the sea current, ya morons!

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.741
You men need to start
payin' attention.

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:58.511
And work on your attitudes
while you're at it.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.813
[TASHIGI]
It is worrisome, sir.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.081
[SMOKER]
That it is.

00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:03.749
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:08:03.783 --> 00:08:05.585
[SMOKER] The fact that
there was a hidden river

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.820
is not what's important.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:11.023
In this situation, what really
matters is whether the ice

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:15.027
blocking it formed
naturally or was man-made.

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:16.162
[MARINE H]
Hold up, Smokey.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:18.364
You mean somebody might've
been hiding the river

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.932
from us on purpose?

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:21.601
[MARINE C]
Come on, nobody lives here!

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:23.503
It's full of poisonous gas!

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:25.571
They'd have to be crazy to
wanna live out their days

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.406
in a gas mask!

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.375
[TASHIGI] The man on the
Snail definitely mentioned

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:31.010
the name of this island.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.279
[MARINE H] You prob'ly just
misheard him, Tashigi.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:36.115
Not even a Transponder Snail
could survive here!

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.951
[MARINE C laughs]
He's got a point!

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.020
[MARINES laughs]

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.221
[TASHIGI]
If you've got time to laugh,

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.690
you've got time to
break up more ice.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:45.925
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.863
[MARINE C]
What in the hell is that?

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:53.466
[MARINE H] Holy crap!
It's a giant wall of ice!

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.901
[TASHIGI]
Our warship is strong,

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.103
but it's no match for
something that size!

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:58.104
[MARINE H]
What'll we do?

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:01.073
[MARINE A]
We've gotta destroy it! Fire!

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.292
They look like trouble.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.061
[gasps]

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.496
[HYOUTAURUS]
Hey! Boss!

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:26.365
Take care of 'em
for me, would ya?

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:33.406
[BROWNBEARD] Heh! Then prepare
yourselves, scoundrels!

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:37.610
For Brownbeard is about to kick
your asses all the way to hell!

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:40.279
[laughs]

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:45.017
[LUFFY] Oh! Check it out, guys!
They're all centaurs!

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.485
Do you think they
wanna join the crew?

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.255
Are you kiddin' me?
You see those weapons?

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:52.258
It looks like they'd
sooner eat us alive!

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.759
I'd have to agree.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.595
Do you think they could
be colleagues of the man

00:09:55.628 --> 00:09:57.129
who sent out the
distress signal?

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.965
[USOPP]
Yeah. I bet they are.

00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:01.467
We'd better clear the air
before they start attacking.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.802
Hey, how are ya?

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:05.471
We're not here to cause trouble,
we're just here to help!

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:07.139
So whaddya say we talk this out?

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.909
You're lyin' through
your teeth, ya scallywag!

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.077
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.145
[BROWNBEARD] It's obvious
you're lookin' for a fight!

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:16.148
Why else would you have brought
that samurai with ya?

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:18.117
Wait, what "samurai"?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.985
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.953
Hey, I think he's
talkin' about you!

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.121
Who, this guy?

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.523
He's not a samurai,
he's a swordsman!

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.326
I promise you, he's not
nearly as tough as he looks.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.363
I mean, sure, he's a big, dumb
meathead and he gets violent

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:33.199
sometimes, but he's not
a murderer or anything.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.201
Did you really just call
me a "dumb meathead"?

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:38.504
[USOPP] Oh no! Someone help,
he's gonna murder me!

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.339
--It was a mistake!
--[ZORO] Would you shut up?

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:42.408
[MALE CENTAUR A] They're
fighting amongst themselves.

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.810
It's nothin' but
a pathetic ploy!

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:48.014
We can't let 'em go any farther!
Dead men tell no tales!

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.949
--Shoot 'em!
--As you wish!

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:53.586
[ALL yell]

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:07.500
[CHOPPER cheers]

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:11.671
Okay, time to bust outta here!
Are ya with me? Let's go!

00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.706
You're really fired up,
aren't ya Chopper?

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.542
You know it! Sanji trusted me
with an important mission,

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.378
that means I've gotta do my best
to protect the children!

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:21.947
I'll do whatever it takes
to get the job done!

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.683
Just watch me!

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.953
I'll get you outta here if
it's the last thing I do!

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:31.190
[SUBORDINATE A] Huh? Where are
all the children going?

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:33.693
[CHOPPER shouts]

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.896
[SUBORDINATES grunt]

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:39.932
[CHOPPER]
Ah!

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:45.037
Don't be scared, kids! I laugh
in the face of danger 'cause...

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:46.539
...I'm a man!

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.041
You're the awesomest
raccoon that ever lived!

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:52.244
I am not a raccoon!
I'm a reindeer, got it buddy?

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.281
[NAMI chuckles] Where do you
think we should go from here?

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:58.484
[CHOPPER] I'm just security,
that's up to you, 'lil lady.

00:11:58.517 --> 00:11:59.985
Huh?

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.588
Miss, are you sure
we'll be okay?

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:05.991
[NAMI] Hm? Oh, I'm positive!
You don't have to worry.

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.761
We're experts at getting out of
dangerous situations.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:10.863
Just relax and follow us.

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:16.702
[CHOPPER cheers]

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.849
Now you've made me mad!
Weapons Left!

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.451
[SUBORDINATES shouts]

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.787
[SUBORDINATES grunting]

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.691
[FRANKY laughs]
Super!

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:41.827
[SUBORDINATE D coughs] He's got
weapons all over his body!

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.663
[SUBORDINATE E] Yeah! He must be
the one who broke the door open!

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:45.765
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:48.467
It sounds like you guys wanna
get to know me better.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:52.104
Okay! I'll spend as much
time here as you want, bro!

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:53.939
[SUBORDINATE D]
Load the poison gas canisters!

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:56.842
The kids are gone,
the coast is clear!

00:12:56.876 --> 00:12:58.911
Alright, fire at will!

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.680
[SUBORDINATE D grunts]

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.219
You should take off
your masks, gentlemen.

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:09.622
Don't you wanna smoke
poisonous gas with us?

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:10.589
[SUBORDINATE E]
Bastard!

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.092
Calm down, there's no
reason to get angry.

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:18.597
[SUBORDINATES grunting]

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:23.369
Heh.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:24.737
He ripped our masks off!

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.372
And he broke our air tanks!

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:28.240
Don't use gas canisters!

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:33.512
[gasps] Whoa, what in the
hell are you? Sheep?

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:37.483
[KIN'EMON growling]

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.552
Why, you!

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.753
Just what're you
doin' down there?

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.721
Who on earth could this be?

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:45.324
This foe is different from
the others I've fought.

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.526
I've never been
challenged like this.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.428
They're quite the
formidable opponent!

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:51.831
I've got no clue what
you're talkin' about, bro.

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:55.434
Sorry. My torso is
currently in battle.

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.702
[FRANKY]
Say what?

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:05.344
[swords clashing]

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:08.747
[BROOK yelps] What's going on?
I'm so confused!

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:11.650
Who are you and why're
you attacking me like this?

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:16.755
Where'd your head go?
And where are your legs?

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:23.762
How frightful! I don't
suppose you can speak?

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:35.541
[MARINE C]
Ready? Fire!

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:36.775
[MARINES grunt]

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.180
[TASHIGI grunts]

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:48.087
[MARINES gasp]

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:55.461
[SMOKER] We're going to reach
the end of the river soon.

00:14:56.662 --> 00:15:00.466
[MARINE I] Really? I wonder
what we'll find there.

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:03.335
[SMOKER]
I've got a pretty good idea.

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.722
[swords clashing]

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.561
[BROOK gasps] You wouldn't
happen to be a ghost

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.830
by chance, would you?

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:34.700
If so, you need to
obey the rules!

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.869
You can't come out
during the day!

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:40.406
Why're you attacking me?
I didn't do anything wrong!

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:43.542
The only reason I came ashore
was to make a snow army!

00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:44.910
There's no point in fighting,

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.179
why don't we build
snowmen instead?

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.248
We can make snow
sculptures if you'd li--

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:52.785
[yelps]

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.620
And I was being nice to you!

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:57.690
[BROOK gasps] That was close,
he almost had me!

00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:00.259
I don't understand how he can
attack with such precision

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.728
when he doesn't
even have any eyes!

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.032
Oh, wait a minute.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:09.568
I just remembered I don't
have any eyes either.

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.904
[chuckles nervously]

00:16:11.937 --> 00:16:15.574
[yelps]

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.647
He's strong... and scary!

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.559
Stay back! I demand
answers from you!

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:37.062
Can't you at least tell me
why you wish to fight?

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:41.233
You asked for it:
Aubade Coup Droit!

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.468
[BROOK gasps]

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:48.107
[BROOK]
Two-Sword Style?

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.077
[BROOK] Okay, now he's
really starting to scare me!

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:54.446
I can't handle it!
He's too creepy!

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.482
And gross! Somebody save me!

00:17:12.164 --> 00:17:13.832
[SUBORDINATE L]
You called, Master?

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.202
[CAESAR CLOWN] Yes. Did you
capture the escapees?

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:20.272
[SUBORDINATE L] Not yet,
but I have news about G-5, sir.

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:22.708
[CAESAR CLOWN scoffs]
Oh, them.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:25.344
[SUBORDINATE L] I'm afraid the
poison gas didn't stop them.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:42.995
[SUBORDINATE L] They've been
firing their cannons

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.663
to break through the ice floes.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:47.900
They're slowly forcing
their way onto the island.

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:48.834
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.402
[SUBORDINATE L]
It looks like...

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.372
...they'll make their way
to the laboratory soon.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.808
[CAESAR CLOWN]
This is quite vexing.

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:59.044
Why do they want to
come ashore so badly?

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.513
Do they know
something we don't?

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:04.416
Tell me, who is their
commanding officer?

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.251
[SUBORDINATE L]
Vice Admiral Smoker.

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.287
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Oh, is that so?

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:15.027
Irksome, but not entirely
unexpected, I suppose.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.095
All right, then.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:18.263
Conceal the ships we have
moored at the front.

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.199
[SUBORDINATE L]
Who's gonna deal with 'em, sir?

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:23.435
[CAESAR CLOWN] No one is
allowed to be on this island.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:26.171
That means you cannot
let them see you.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.906
[SUBORDINATE L]
So... you'll deal with 'em?

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.910
Don't be a fool! I can't afford
to reveal myself to them!

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.911
[SUBORDINATE L]
Then what'll we do?

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.047
There's nobody else
who can stop them!

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.348
[CAESAR CLOWN grunts]

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.016
[LAW]
Ya want me to handle it?

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.251
[SUBORDINATE L]
Huh?

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:07.479
[MARINES grunt]

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.047
[MARINE C]
We finally made it to land.

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:11.483
[MARINE H] I thought I
was gonna die back there.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.118
[TASHIGI]
This is no time to be lazy.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.420
Besides, we just got here.
Now get up!

00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:16.989
[MARINE N]
Don't be so hard on us.

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:20.058
We worked our butts off to
get here! Give us a break!

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.294
[TASHIGI]
Enough whining!

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.263
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.731
[TASHIGI]
Vice Admiral!

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.799
Everyone calm down.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.048
Just as I thought.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.452
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.622
There's no gas here.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:52.024
[MARINES]
What?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.930
[MARINE H] She's right, I can't
believe it! I can breathe!

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:59.932
There was definitely
poisonous gas earlier,

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:01.533
so where the hell did it go?

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.435
[SMOKER] I assume it was
released by someone

00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:05.204
who doesn't want us here.

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:07.506
[MARINE H]
Whoa, who'd do that to us?

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:09.875
[TASHIGI] Let's search the
island and find out.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.312
Wait, is this?

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:17.015
That's right, this is
Dr. Vegapunk's laboratory.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.385
At least, it used to be.

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:23.021
There shouldn't be anyone here.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.958
It was abandoned
a long time ago.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:30.629
[bell buzzes]

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:33.298
The place still has power.

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:35.901
[MARINE H] Think someone
could be living here?

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:39.805
[MARINE S] Come out and face us!
Hurry up! What's wrong?

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:41.306
Are you afraid of
us or somethin'?

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.709
Y'know, we don't just have to
stand here ringin' the bell

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.977
waitin' for 'em to answer!

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.546
Nuh-uh, all we've really gotta
do is break down the door

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:51.216
with our cannons, Smokey--
I mean, Mr. Smoker, sir.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.884
[MARINE T]
Anyone in there? Answer us!

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:55.187
[MARINE U]
Open this door, or else!

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.489
Hey, listen up!
You're trespassin'!

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:58.924
Nobody's allowed on this island.

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:01.393
I dunno who you are,
but you're under arrest!

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.928
Come out right now!

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:08.433
Uh-oh! Ignorin' us?
Hey, bring the cannon over here!

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:10.502
Maybe they'll listen if we
put a hole in the door!

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:11.370
No, don't!

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:14.773
[clanking]

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.675
[MARINES gasp]

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:17.943
Whoa, it opened!

00:21:17.976 --> 00:21:21.113
Surrender at once!
Or we're comin' for ya!

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:30.956
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.493
[MARINES gasp]

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:39.231
[MARINES yell]

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:43.602
[LAW] So tell me, what brings
you to my vacation home...

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.003
...White Hunter?

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.240
Aw man, you gotta
be kidding me!

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:49.708
It can't be!

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:53.545
He used to be a rookie with a
440 million Berry bounty.

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.747
But now he's among them.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:22:00.819
Dracule "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk.
The Pirate Empress Boa Hancock.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:03.655
Donquixote Doflamingo.

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:06.158
Pirates backed by the
World Government.

00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.026
The Seven Warlords!

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.932
Hello, Trafalgar Law.

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:18.103
[MARINES scream]

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:23.175
[MARINE C] We should just
go back to the ship, Smoker!

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:26.178
I don't want anything to do
with him after what he did!

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.846
You heard about it, didn't ya?

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:33.618
[MARINE C] In order to become a
member of the Seven Warlords...

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:38.790
[MARINE V]
Huh?

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.127
[gasps]

00:22:43.462 --> 00:22:45.530
[MARINE C] ...he delivered the
hearts of a hundred pirates

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:48.800
to the Navy headquarters.
He's off the rails!

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.471
[MARINE C]
The guy's a creep!

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:53.705
[grunts]

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:57.876
[SMOKER] You wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:00.445
Surely, you're aware that no
one's allowed to step foot

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:02.013
on this island, Law.

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.383
Not pirates or
Government allies.

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:05.817
That clear?

00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:10.222
[LAW] Hm! I see. That means
you aren't allowed either.

00:23:18.096 --> 00:23:20.365
[NARRATOR] Law prevents
Smoker from advancing.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:22.567
And with neither side
willing to cooperate,

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:25.036
the tension rapidly
comes to a head.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.839
Suddenly, the straw hat
emerge from the facility

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.307
with children in tow.

00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:32.544
Then, an unexpected move from
Law causes the conflict

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.413
to become even more explosive.

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:36.248
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.984
"The Warlord!
Trafalgar Law!"

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:41.753
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
