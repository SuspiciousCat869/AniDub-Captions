00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.904
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:07.807
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.610
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.879
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.081
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.917
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:20.220
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:23.223
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.625
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:30.663
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.792
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.762
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:48.001
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.670
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.806
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.742
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:58.111
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:03:00.847
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:03.816
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.020
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.757
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.961
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.100
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.536
the Straw Hat Pirates
depart for the deadly waters

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.473
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:28.441
[LUFFY gasps]

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:32.045
[screams] I broke him! Sorry!

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.514
"Sorry" is all you have to say?!

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.783
He's dead now!

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.017
[NARRATOR]
On the island of Punk Hazard,

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.019
they meet a pair of legs.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.823
[LUFFY laughs]
I'm a centaur!

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:47.126
This is awesome! [laughs]

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.861
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, the rest of the crew

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.531
faced problems of their own.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.834
[KIN'EMON] What you see on the
floor are pieces of my face.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:58.605
I beg of you, please put
them back together for me.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:03.743
I believe my chin and hair
may still be somewhat awry.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.311
But, it's good enough.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.879
I'm grateful.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.848
[ALL]
It's a severed head!

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.750
Yes, clearly!

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:14.654
[HYOUTAUROS]
I'm your worst enemy, intruder!

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.888
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.192
[HYOUTAUROS chuckles, gasps]

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.893
[BOTH]
Those legs!

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.030
Where did you... get them?

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:29.068
Wow! They're awesome! [laughs]

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.904
[MONET]
Well? Did you find them?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.740
Yeah. They're right here.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.942
I've got all four
of 'em in my sights.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.978
I'll take them out. Don't worry.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:40.480
I see.

00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.484
You have fun with that.

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.552
Give me a ring when
you're done, all right?

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:48.121
[BAD GUY 581A]
Roger.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.589
[MONET chuckles]

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.831
[LUFFY] "Startling!
The Secret of the Island

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.100
is Finally Revealed!"

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:09.842
So this guy cut you.

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:14.747
You're still alive even
without a body? That's crazy!

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.650
It's like Buggy. Creepy.

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.152
[KIN'EMON]
Under different circumstances,

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:22.655
I'd slit my belly and
die unmourned, but alas.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.457
There's something
that I must do!

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.860
Even if I'm forced to
live in disgrace!

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.128
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.636
Hold on. Old man?

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.604
Can you tell us
anything about this place?

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:40.306
"Old man," you say!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.109
You need to show
some respect, you woman!

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.877
I'm a proud warrior, you know!

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.481
Where I'm from, women are
chaste, and they are modest!

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.117
They walk three steps
behind the men!

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.051
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:53.386
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.056
Too bad. I don't care.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.292
You're just a head. Be grateful.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:02.028
We easily could have kept you
in pieces on the floor.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.163
Unhand me, you damn harlot!

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.300
[NAMI] Wow, you really
don't get it, do you?

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:10.236
[KIN'EMON]
I said unhand me! Curse you!

00:06:12.271 --> 00:06:15.308
Is this proper
where you come from?

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.643
I've never suffered
such rudeness!

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:19.078
However.

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:21.314
It seems your clothes
were torn from your body,

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:24.851
so perhaps I should
be more sympathetic.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:29.255
[sighs] I chose this outfit
myself, thank you very much.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:30.223
[KIN'EMON]
What?

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:32.191
[NAMI]
Sorry, but I look good!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.093
[KIN'EMON]
Your attire is obscene!

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:36.028
All you're wearing
is a breast-band!

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.664
You like it, don't you?

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.333
[KIN'EMON]
Yes indeed I do!

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:41.734
I know that look!

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:47.573
[KIN'EMON groaning]

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.642
[SANJI]
You pervert.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.446
[gasps]

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.758
That was a trap!

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.594
[CHOPPER] You must have
cracked your skull!

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.896
That looks painful!

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.931
Yes! No!

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.700
I mean, uh, it's fine!

00:07:14.734 --> 00:07:16.202
It barely tickles!

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.404
[CHOPPER, FRANKY]
No one's that tough!

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:19.572
[sighs]

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.408
I see.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.912
So a breast-band is
appropriate in your land.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.146
I approve.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.614
I don't care what you think!

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:31.083
Please, just answer
me one thing.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.952
Who are you people?

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:37.290
I heard our captors say that
you were seized from a ship.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:39.492
Yeah, that's right.
We're pirates.

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:43.629
[KIN'EMON gasps]
You're pirates?

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.432
If only I had known sooner!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.067
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.002
I loathe pirates!

00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:51.571
Though I should have guessed.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.806
That does explain
your barbarism!

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.107
[gasps]

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.813
In this frozen hell,

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:03.416
I thought we were
all victims of fate,

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.619
so I had hoped that we
could escape together.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:09.322
Alas, it shan't be so.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:12.592
[FRANKY]
Huh? Wait, you lost me here.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.126
What do you mean "frozen"?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.029
This place is so hot,
even the sea is on fire.

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:19.198
[CHOPPER] Yeah, there was
lava and everything!

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:21.200
We were sweating
just on the boat!

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.369
Aha. I see.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.473
Old man.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.509
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.944
[NAMI]
Did you see the volcano here?

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:36.349
Or feel an eruption?
Something like that?

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:39.285
I did hear a loud explosion,

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:43.489
but both the island and the sea
surrounding it were frozen.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.992
And that is the last thing
that I shall say to you.

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.960
Cursed pirates!

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:48.861
[NAMI]
The sky.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:51.531
I thought it looked strange.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.300
I could tell,
even from the boat.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.168
The flaming side that
Luffy and the others

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.871
went to is only
half of the island.

00:08:58.905 --> 00:09:01.340
The people that grabbed us
took us to the other side--

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.242
which is frozen solid.

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.245
[NAMI]
We need to get out of this room.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.480
I don't care how.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:10.016
Then we'll find out
what's going on here.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.217
[SANJI]
I get what you're saying,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.853
but I kicked it pretty hard
and that door isn't budging.

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:14.854
[FRANKY]
Step aside!

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.022
[SANJI, NAMI]
Huh?

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.724
My cola is maxed out!

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:27.867
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.769
Whoa, whoa, that's a big one!

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:30.703
[BOTH scream]

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:35.474
[FRANKY]
Franky Radical Beam!

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.113
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:43.916
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.284
[FRANKY chuckles]

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.961
[FRANKY]
Let's move, brother.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.797
Damn, Franky.
Shoulda led with that one.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.533
[CHOPPER] Sometimes I wish
I was a cyborg, too!

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:04.170
[NAMI chuckles] I'm happy with
one Franky. We don't need two.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.782
[SANJI]
So, what are you gonna do?

00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:21.253
[SANJI] Last chance. You'd
rather sit there on the floor

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.456
than associate with pirates?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.059
Silence! Leave me be!

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.728
[SANJI] So, what, are you
gonna roll out of here

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.097
and bite your way to freedom?

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:33.933
Let me go!

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:38.604
Well, samurai? Tell me!

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:42.274
[CHOPPER]
What? Samurai? For real?!

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.644
[SANJI] This topknot is
a traditional hairstyle

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.346
in the Land of Wano.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.982
[CHOPPER] So, he's the one
who killed those guys?

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.350
Does that mean he might kill us?

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:52.818
Or bite us?

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.420
No!

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:55.855
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582A]
What was that explosion?

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.089
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582B]
I have no idea!

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.858
Do you think it
was those pirates?

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.694
[FRANKY]
Guess my beam was too radical.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:05.898
Hey. They're
coming. Let's hurry!

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.536
[KIN'EMON growls]

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:13.606
We came here because
we received a distress call

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.441
from one of your victims.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:19.011
You got a story you
wanna tell us? Or not?

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:22.148
[KIN'EMON growls]

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:31.290
[CHOPPER] Sanji! C'mon!
Leave him here! He's our enemy!

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.858
I swear.

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:36.195
I would not disgrace myself
by killing in cold blood.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.229
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:42.702
I'm here to save my son's life!

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:46.205
And I would cut down anyone
who stands in my way!

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.021
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582A]
There!

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.322
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582B]
Don't let them get away!

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.390
[ALL gasp]

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.361
[BOTH scream]

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.897
[FRANKY] Those're my friends.
Cut it out, will ya?

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.533

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.237
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES
groan]

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.605
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582A]
You're kidding me!

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:21.340
How did they
get out of that room?

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.375
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 582B]
I dunno, but we'd better

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.211
call the master.

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.680
What the hell
do they want from us?

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:28.914
Dunno.

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.382
Wait a sec!

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.852
You brought the head? Why?

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:35.421
It'll work out. Leave him to me.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.793
There's a door!

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:49.468
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:12:59.979 --> 00:13:00.813
What?

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:02.481
[ALL gasp]

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:12.458
[gasps]

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.928
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:21.600
Who're you?

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.502
[CHOPPER]
What?!

00:13:24.603 --> 00:13:26.639
Hello there, kids.

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:29.341
[KIN'EMON]
What? There's children?

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.377
They're so big!

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.285
[FRANKY] I guess they're giants.
But are we in prison or daycare?

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.779
Wow, so all your buddies
have awesome animal legs

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.314
just like these, huh?

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:09.782
I can't wait to see!

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:12.518
Yeah! They'll get a big
kick out of you, too!

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:14.753
They're gonna love
your talking ones!

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.589
Ha, ha! Follow me!

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:19.625
[LUFFY] Wait. How 'bout first
we race to that burning tower

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:22.061
to see whose legs are the best?

00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.432
Ready? Go!

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:32.338
[BOTH laughing]

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:35.107
Come on. This is boring.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.010
[USOPP] Huh? What d'you
mean everyone's gone?

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.012
Then where did they go?

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:43.215
And wait a sec. You said
there's ice and snow?

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:46.118
[BROOK laughs]
Indeed there is!

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.821
See, when I awoke to find
the ship in that condition,

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:51.790
it was quite a shock-chilling
bone, you might say!

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:55.227
Wait. I mean a
chill-boning shocker?

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:58.063
No, it's chock
shocking something.

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:58.998
Never mind!

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.834
[BROOK laughs, coughs]

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.202
Oh, sorry!

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.470
Okay, wait.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:07.006
You said there were these guys
on the Sunny when you woke up.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.540
Who were they?

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:19.084
I forgot to ask.

00:15:19.118 --> 00:15:20.753
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
Sh-Shoot it! Shoot it!

00:15:20.786 --> 00:15:22.755
Huh? Wait! No shooting!

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.690
Let's not be hasty!

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:26.926
[gunshots]

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.027
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581B]
He's gone!

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.962
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A]
Wait, is he a ghost?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.899
Goodness, if you have
something to say,

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.936
then you should say
it over tea, not guns.

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.504
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATE 581A
gasps] There he is!

00:15:38.537 --> 00:15:41.407
[BROOK] But it's too late.
I've cut you down.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.341
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.710
[BROOK]
Arrow Notch Slash.

00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:45.778
You're done!

00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:47.112
[CAESAR CLOWN SUBORDINATES
groan]

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:50.716
[BROOK] Probably should've
questioned them first!

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.785
Oh well! Pity!

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.689
[BROOK]
So, there you have it.

00:15:56.722 --> 00:16:00.225
Terribly sorry.
I don't know a thing.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:01.627
They're all wearing gas masks

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.429
and have tanks on
their backs, though.

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.431
A gas mask? Huh.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.466
They likely used some
sort of chemical weapon

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.234
to knock everyone out.

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:11.370
Then, in the meantime,
they moved the Sunny

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:13.605
over to the other
side of the island.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:17.042
[LUFFY]
Damn! You beat me!

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.811
You're too fast!

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:24.483
[laughs] Well, your legs aren't
built for running like mine.

00:16:24.516 --> 00:16:26.986
[LUFFY]
Okay! Round two! C'mon!

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:28.220
Ha, suit yourself, but--

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.222
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 582A rings]
Cu-lick.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:31.323
Hello?

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:33.258
[BAD GUY 581A]
What the hell are you doing?

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.494
Sorry. I can't find them.

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:38.964
You sure the intruders
are nearby? I got nothing.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.232
There's a guy, though.

00:16:40.265 --> 00:16:42.835
He's got talking legs,
but he's one of us.

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:44.770
[BAD GUY 581A]
No, he's not, you moron!

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.171
[HYOUTAUROS gasps]

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:49.641
Something wrong?
I'm ready to do this!

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.476
What?

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:53.779
[BROOK]
But the others. I do worry.

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:56.648
If they didn't leave a note,
there's only one answer.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.417
They were taken by
those men in masks.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.286
[USOPP] Right! And they
didn't take you because

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.522
you looked dead,
until you woke up.

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.190
[BROOK]
Instead of feeling unwanted,

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:07.292
I suppose I should
feel grateful.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.995
[ROBIN] They might
send help. Let's be quick.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:11.630
Look around. See anything?

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.098
Like a building, or--?

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:15.300
[BROOK] You scarcely
need me at all, Robin,

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.469
it's like you can
see it yourself!

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:25.144
Indeed. There is.

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:29.515
And it's massive.

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:32.184
It's not a restaurant.
I know that much.

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:33.552
[ROBIN]
Keep a low profile.

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.154
We'll get there
as soon as possible.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:36.388
[BROOK]
Roger!

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:37.823
Oh, Robin?

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.358
While I've got you on.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.459
What kind of panties are--

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.760
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL 582B]
Cu-lick.

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:45.130
You think these guys
work for the Government?

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:47.132
[USOPP] Who knows.
But they're human.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:51.036
So I guess that's better than
what we've been getting here.

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:54.039
[USOPP]
A fire-breathing dragon.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.375
A pair of talking legs.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.777
Some bird woman.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:04.083
Plus, that centaur guy
Luffy made friends with.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.585
Speaking of. Huh?

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:08.220
[HYOUTAUROS]
Try to trick me, will you?

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:09.988
[LUFFY]
What? No! Stop!

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.223
[HYOUTAUROS grunts]

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.864
[HYOUTAUROS]
I thought you were one of us.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.901
We were friends a second ago!

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.003
You're the one who
started swinging that club!

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.238
Don't blame me!

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:30.075
[BAD GUY 581A groans]
You're finished, sucker!

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.377
Luffy! Careful!

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.713
All right, then, let me.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.715
Cien Fleurs!

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:40.619
[ROBIN]
Bellflower!

00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:44.957
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.432
Oh, hey. 'Sup?

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.803
Giraffes? What's next?

00:18:57.836 --> 00:18:58.971
[USOPP gasps]

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:01.306
I guess there's all kinds
of centaurs out there, huh?

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.374
That's funny.

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:03.909
[USOPP]
It is not funny!

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:06.879
These guys are monsters and
they're trying to kill you!

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:08.881
[ROBIN]
What happened with your friend?

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:11.416
I dunno. He got a
transponder snail call.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.252
Then he decided
he didn't like me.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.453
[gasps]

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:20.559
Look. He's got one, too,
and it says "CC" on it.

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:23.662
They're not just
free-roaming magical creatures.

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:26.231
They're part of
some organization.

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.232
"CC"?

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.568
Well, that's lame.

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:32.404
What's worse, even if
we tried to get out of here,

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:33.839
the Sunny is gone.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:36.441
All we can do now is to go
the frozen side of the island

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.776
and find Brook.

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:41.180
Chopper. Nami. Sanji. Franky.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:43.115
We've lost them all!

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.652
It is troubling.

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.488
They were all taken
by those men in masks.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.856
If they're passed out,

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.858
the enemy could kill them
any time they like.

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.826
Don't say that!

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.028
[ZORO]
What a mess.

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:57.262
We did this all wrong.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.431
Everything's happening
on the frozen side.

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:00.666
We did fine!

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:02.167
I got to eat that big dragon!

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.036
And I met Doctor
Legingston, too!

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.705
Did you say "Legingston"?

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.674
That's what I named
my new back legs!

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.510
[KIN'EMON] Poot! I have no idea
what's going on right now.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:12.978
There seems to
have been a fight.

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.147
So what's next, legs?

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.882
We were going to the
other side anyway,

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:20.285
so nothing really changed,
if you ask me.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.321
Rescue, then snowcones.

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:25.123
[USOPP] Forget the snowcones,
it's a rescue mission!

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.360
And since I can't run away,
guess I'm gonna fight!

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.630
Well. I hope they sell
warm coats over there.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:35.367
[USOPP shivers] More likely
we'll just all freeze to death.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.103
It was nice knowing you.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.974
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Remarkable!

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:44.843
They were able to penetrate
my impenetrable door!

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:45.677
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:47.045
[SUBORDINATE 582A]
Master!

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.749
[CAESAR CLOWN]
This burn mark.

00:20:50.782 --> 00:20:54.553
It looks like it was
caused by a laser.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.022
I thought that
Dr. Vegapunk's Pacifistas

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:59.424
were the only things
with that power.

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:02.194
At any rate, whoever
these intruders are,

00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:04.896
they're not to be trifled with!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.198
That being said,

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.734
I assume you haven't
recaptured them yet.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:09.835
[SUBORDINATE 582A]
Last I heard, they were

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.670
corralling them into
the Biscuit Room.

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:15.340
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Hmm. I suppose that could work.

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.708
[SUBORDINATE 582D]
Master, are you there?

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:20.279
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh? Yes. Go ahead.

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.446
[SUBORDINATE 582D]
A Navy ship is approaching

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.614
the northwest shore.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.449
It looks like they're with G-5.

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.717
What should we do?

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:29.755
[CAESAR CLOWN groans] Turn
them away, and do it quickly!

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.724
Throw out some poison gas.
They'll get the idea.

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.893
But be certain not to kill them.

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:36.962
We wouldn't want to
start any trouble.

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.630
[SUBORDINATE 582D]
Yes, sir!

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.274
[TASHIGI] The men are
in danger, Vice Admiral!

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:51.543
[RANDOM MARINE 582A]
I--I can't breathe!

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:53.412
[RANDOM MARINE 582B]
This gas is everywhere!

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:56.948
Be careful! Don't inhale
a single breath!

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.151
Put on gas masks!

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:02.421
This got messy already.
What a dangerous place.

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.755
In case you hadn't heard,

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:07.225
Doctor Vegapunk used to test his
chemical weapons on this island.

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:10.095
Then they shut the operation
down four years ago.

00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:11.496
If Straw Hat's here,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.066
I sure as heck don't
see his pirate ship.

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:17.402
Besides, the island's been
a hellhole since the accident.

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:20.105
No one can survive out there!

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:23.141
[SMOKER]
I don't buy it.

00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:26.244
It's been too long and
there's too much gas.

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.980
I don't understand, sir.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:31.683
[SMOKER] Two years ago,
there was no sea of fire,

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.251
or sea of ice.

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:35.987
It was just a deserted island.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.156
The toxic substances
from the accident

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.992
were already
cleared out as well.

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.527
They had to be.

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.663
Otherwise, Aokiji and Akainu

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.965
wouldn't have held
their duel here.

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:50.168
This island is the
mark of their battle.

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.820
[SMOKER] A struggle so great
that the earth, the sky,

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:12.991
and the sea itself
were transformed.

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:18.230
[NARRATOR]
The children are surprised

00:23:18.263 --> 00:23:20.499
at the sight of
Sanji and his team.

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:22.801
With the master's men
approaching fast,

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:24.836
and very little time to waste,

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.305
the tiny captives
share an upsetting truth

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.573
about their plight.

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.143
Nami is determined to
answer the children's pleas,

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.412
and the team rushes into action.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.313
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:38.817
"Save the Children!
The Straw Hats Start to Fight!"

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.720
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
