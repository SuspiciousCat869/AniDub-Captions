Well?

00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:38.697
Uh! From what I've heard,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.835
each and every

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:43.941
There's never more than one of
each kind at the same time.

Although...

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.448
If the owner of the
fruit's power dies,

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.519
another Devil Fruit
with the same power

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:51.857
will suddenly sprout up
at some random place

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.627
somewhere in the world.

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.232
And the next person who
finds it and eats it,

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.804
they become the new
holder of its power.

00:06:58.838 --> 00:07:02.244
After Fire Fist Ace died, his
Flame Flame Fruit was reborn,

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.814
but nobody knew where.

00:07:03.848 --> 00:07:06.953
Until the Young Master
managed to hunt it down.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.696
That's how it is, huh?

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.134
Seems a bit crazy to offer up
something like that

00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.340
as a tournament prize,
but hey, who am I to judge?

00:07:17.374 --> 00:07:20.180

on power like that...

whole new life for myself.

you could eat it!

lose my ability to swim.

already got Gum-Gum powers.

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:20.808
The women here are so passionate
that they stab for love?

00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:21.676
Okay!

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:24.047
[VIOLET]
You're okay with stabbing?

00:15:25.884 --> 00:15:28.389
No! What's wrong?

00:15:28.422 --> 00:15:32.464
You must stop! I beg you not
to indulge this wicked woman!

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:33.800
What...?

00:15:35.504 --> 00:15:39.478
Don't take that risk.
I might fall in love with you.

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:42.518
[SANJI groaning]

00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:48.964
[VIOLET sobs]

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:52.905
[VIOLET] Huh? I should've
told you, my name is Violet.

00:15:52.938 --> 00:15:55.409
Would you mind,
if it's not too much,

00:15:55.442 --> 00:15:57.548
escorting me to the next town?

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.218
[SANJI]
Anything.

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.288
And once we arrive...

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.074
...there is a man there
I need you to kill for me.

00:16:11.108 --> 00:16:12.476
Huh?

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.059
[ZORO] I don't give a damn
if it's a national treasure.

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:24.301
The Shusui belongs to me,
and I'm not gonna lose it!

00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:27.206
Seriously, giant toys
living side by side

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.981
with humans, and now
thieving fairies?

00:16:31.015 --> 00:16:34.220
Holy crap, talk about
an obnoxious country.

00:16:34.254 --> 00:16:36.058
But that's what
fairies do for fun!

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:38.095
What're you babbling about?

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:39.364
When they engage in mischief,

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:42.236
the only thing to do
is turn a blind eye!

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.176
[ZORO] I couldn't care less
if it's a real fairy or not.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.684
No. I'm gonna chop it up
into fantasyland stew!

00:16:48.717 --> 00:16:49.852
Huh?!

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.294
[ZORO] Hey, wait right there,
you damn thief!

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:08.288
[SANJI]
"To my dearest Nami and Robin.

00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:10.561
I pray that you have it
in your heart to forgive

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:12.831
this shameful man.

00:17:12.864 --> 00:17:15.738
For I have finally... finally...

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:19.410
...met the one and only
everlasting love of my life."

00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:31.936
From here on, think of
me as your bodyguard.

00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:36.278
Yes. I was born into this
world to protect you.

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:45.029
[SANJI] This romantic island,
Dressrosa. I love it!

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:49.103
[KIN'EMON]
I will retrieve the treasure

00:17:49.137 --> 00:17:51.041
of the Wano Kingdom
at all costs!

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:53.378
Although, first,
I must retrieve Kanjuro

00:17:53.412 --> 00:17:56.786
who's being held captive
by Doflamingo's clan.

00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:59.591
Kanjuro!

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:02.196
Must you really
rush right past me?

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:05.704
Huh. Did that just happen?

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:08.843
That lovely young lady
expressed an affection for me.

00:18:08.877 --> 00:18:12.618
How wonderfully assertive.
But I can't!

00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:14.722
[MERCHANT A]
Come back and talk with me!

00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:17.327
[KIN'EMON]
I... I really should not!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.299
To be distracted by
such temptation is...

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.505
...dishonorable!

00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:25.810
Kanjuro! Where are you?

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:33.325
[SANJI]
And what have we got in here?

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:34.829
--[footsteps]
--[COOK A] Huh?

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:36.131
Hey, we're closed.

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:37.968
What d'ya think yer doin'
bargin' in here?

00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:41.375
Didn't ya see the
sign out front?

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:44.481
[SANJI] All right, ya got some
decent ingredients...

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:47.487
But your cutlery and pans
are in terrible shape.

00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:50.192
Haven't even bothered
to wash the dishes.

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:51.529
But you don't look
like you've bothered

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:52.965
to wash yourselves, either.

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:56.237
Look, jerk, who do
you think you are?

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:57.674
[SANJI]
The man who will cook a meal

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:59.645
for the most
beautiful woman alive.

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:03.085
Now get the hell out
of this kitchen.

00:19:03.118 --> 00:19:06.692
Okay, punk! You asked for this!

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:10.299
[COOK A groaning]
Who the hell is this guy?

00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:18.817
Never stand between a chef
and the meal he's gotta make.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.589
I just need your kitchen
for a little while.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.462
[SANJI]
Oh, Violet, my dear.

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:30.039
Sorry for the wait. Dancing
requires great stamina.

00:19:31.642 --> 00:19:32.845
[VIOLET gasps]

00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:34.615
And great stamina is best fueled

00:19:34.648 --> 00:19:37.487
by a delicious and
nutritious dish.

00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:38.690
[VIOLET]
You made this?

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:40.527
[ZORO]
Get back here!

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:44.568
You thieving fairy!

00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:47.641
Was that Moss Head?

00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:52.450
[KIN'EMON] You must be here
somewhere! Kanjuro!

00:19:53.587 --> 00:19:55.322
[SANJI]
Kin'emon!

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:57.126
[VIOLET]
What's happening out there?

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.731
[SANJI]
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:06.044
[SANJI] I didn't intend to split
off on my own like this.

00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:10.854
Forgive me, Luffy.
I'm following my destiny!

00:20:10.887 --> 00:20:13.526
[CROWD cheers]

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.896
[FRANKY]
Looks like the place.

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:17.399
[LUFFY]
Whoa, that colosseum is huge!

00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:19.538
[FRANKY]
Must be one heck of a show!

00:20:19.571 --> 00:20:21.776
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:23.479
The crowd's goin' nuts in there!

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:25.784
Makes me wanna sign up
for the competition!

00:20:25.818 --> 00:20:28.054
Yeah, listen to all that!

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:30.627
[GUARD A]
Damn fugitive toy!

00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:32.531
[GUARD B]
Get away from the colosseum!

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:36.037
One of these days
we're gonna catch you!

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:39.143
Keep trying! You suckers!

00:20:39.177 --> 00:20:40.613
Jet Walk!

00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:52.571
[TOY SOLDIER grunts, laughs]

00:20:57.147 --> 00:20:59.484
[TOY SOLDIER grunts]

00:20:59.518 --> 00:21:00.520
[TOY SOLDIER]
Ha!

00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:01.723
[GUARDS gasp]

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.194
[TOY SOLDIER]
You were too slow! Look!

00:21:04.227 --> 00:21:06.331
My foot is placed
in the colosseum!

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:09.905
I don't really need to remind
you of the law, do I?

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:13.980
[laughing] As you both know,
the police and the Navy

00:21:14.014 --> 00:21:15.650
are forbidden
from entering here!

00:21:15.683 --> 00:21:16.753
[GUARDS growl]

00:21:16.786 --> 00:21:19.023
It doesn't matter if
you're chasing a criminal.

00:21:19.056 --> 00:21:21.996
This is not your jurisdiction!

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.365
The only rule of law

00:21:23.398 --> 00:21:26.772
within these walls is that
of the Don Quixote Family!

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:29.044
If you choose to
pull those triggers,

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:32.317
then you will be the
ones thrown in jail!

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.487
Now begone!

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:35.790
[GUARDS]
Dammit.

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:40.032
[FRANKY]
Man, this island is weird.

00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:42.170
They've got a toy
on the wanted list?

00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:46.178
Gotta admit, little dude's
got some bluster, though.

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:48.916
[TOY SOLDIER grunting]

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.954
Oh, my, elderly gentlemen.

00:21:50.987 --> 00:21:53.693
May I offer to carry your
belongings for you?

00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:56.800
What the...? He sure
got polite in a hurry.

00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.572
[LUFFY laughs]
You're one funny soldier.

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:03.513
Oh, am I? Do you find me funny?

00:22:03.546 --> 00:22:07.053
What about this? Is this funny?

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:08.823
[LUFFY laughs]

00:22:08.857 --> 00:22:11.996
[FRANKY] All right, pal,
can ya clear the path?

00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:15.570
I... I'm sorry.
I was blocking your way.

00:22:15.604 --> 00:22:19.010
[FRANKY] Jeez, your face
turned as red as your coat.

00:22:19.044 --> 00:22:21.649
You're a pretty serious guy
deep down, ain't cha?

00:22:21.682 --> 00:22:24.020
What? Of course I'm not!

00:22:24.053 --> 00:22:26.860
Toys only exist to
make people smile!

00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:29.798
There's no such thing
as a serious toy!

00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:33.172
[LUFFY laughing]
Now he's all mad!

00:22:33.205 --> 00:22:35.042
Last chance to sign up!

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:39.417
Entries for the public are
closing! It's now or never!

00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:42.490
[sighs] Not like anyone
actually has the guts

00:22:42.524 --> 00:22:45.764
to enter this contest. Cowards.

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:47.366
Ya see that, Luffy?

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:49.605
Looks like we just found
your ticket inside!

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:51.241
[LUFFY]
Hm? Okay.

00:22:51.274 --> 00:22:54.080
Hey! Over here! I wanna enter!

00:22:54.114 --> 00:22:56.652
I'm gonna enter! Me!

00:22:58.088 --> 00:22:59.558
[TOY SOLDIER]
What?

00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:02.230
What? No, you can't,
you're too old!

00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:03.599
Please, sir!

00:23:04.702 --> 00:23:07.540
[chuckles]

00:23:15.056 --> 00:23:17.493
[NARRATOR] Disguised as
an anonymous competitor,

00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:19.330
Luffy infiltrates the Colosseum,

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:20.968
where he meets
the other fighters--

00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:22.971
a wide variety of
criminals, assassins,

00:23:23.004 --> 00:23:24.908
and vicious New World pirates.

00:23:24.942 --> 00:23:28.048
As nefarious plots unfold to
claim the Flame Flame Fruit,

00:23:28.082 --> 00:23:29.918
Luffy springs into action!

00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:31.488
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:35.262
"A Formidable, Unknown Warrior!
Here Comes Lucy!"

00:23:35.295 --> 00:23:37.968
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
