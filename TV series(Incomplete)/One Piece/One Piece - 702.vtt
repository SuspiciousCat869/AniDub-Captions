00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.658
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.832
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:04.368
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:08.376
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.752
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.428
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:19.365
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:21.435
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.941
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.547
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.586
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.657
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.961
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.401
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:38.771
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:41.242
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:43.246
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.350
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:48.123
[LUFFY]
Octopus Stamp!

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.897
[LUFFY yelling]

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.404
[NARRATOR] Burning with anger,
Law reveals his sobering motive.

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:59.445
The only reason I'm alive now
is thanks to Cora!

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:02.618
But I'm grateful to you, too.

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:06.225
You gave me the power I need
to kick your ass, after all.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.597
[NARRATOR]
It was 16 years in the past

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.605
that Law and Doflamingo's
complicated relationship began.

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.143
[NARRATOR]
Having lost everything,

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:17.147
Law approached the
Don Quixote Family.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.888
Wishing only for destruction,
he asks to join their crew.

00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.226
It was then that he met Corazon.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.799
[LAW]
There. It's Corazon.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.369
It's not fair that
my parents, my sister,

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.406
and my friends
from the church died

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.413
when this idiot
is allowed to live!

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.985
I'll do this quietly
and go unnoticed.

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:38.089
Nobody will care...

00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.895
...if one scumbag goes missing!

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:31.095
[COMMONER A] They're a family
of Celestial Dragons!

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.604
[COMMONER C]
Let's hang them!

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.748
[COMMONER A] They're "former"
Celestial Dragons!

00:05:40.782 --> 00:05:42.986
The Navy won't care
if we kill them!

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:44.723
They'll just look the other way.

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:46.626
[COMMONER B] We finally
have a chance to retaliate

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.601
against them! I never
thought I'd see the day!

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:53.105
[COMMONER C] Let's break
their bones with a hammer!

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.477
[COMMONER D]
Shower them in arrows!

00:05:55.512 --> 00:05:57.515
[COMMONER A]
Wait! Don't kill 'em yet!

00:05:57.548 --> 00:06:01.590
We need to keep them alive,
so they can really suffer!

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.461
Yeah! Burn in hell!

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:07.835
[COMMONER N] Show them no mercy!
This is our revenge!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.706
Listen bastards!

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:11.977
You took my two sons from me!

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.848
They were innocent children!

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.454
They just walked in front of
a Celestial Dragon, that's all!

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:21.697
But they paid the ultimate
price! How's that even fair?

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.466
My daughter was their slave.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.571
She barely escaped
her captors alive!

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:27.642
She came home devastated,

00:06:27.675 --> 00:06:30.748
and killed herself
three days later!

00:06:32.318 --> 00:06:35.290
I too suffered as a slave.

00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:37.228
My... My eyes.

00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:39.900
Because of you, I am blind!

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:42.137
I'll never get to
see my wife again!

00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:44.408
You! You treated us
like animals,

00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:46.713
so why should we
give a damn, huh?

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:48.350
[COMMONER I]
Because of the Heavenly Tribute

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:49.787
we must forfeit to you,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.658
our beautiful nation
succumbed to famine!

00:06:52.692 --> 00:06:55.163
Have you ever been
hungry a day in your life?

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.570
Our people are dying
from starvation!

00:06:58.604 --> 00:07:00.741
You're all like gods,
aren't you?

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:03.212
If that's true, you won't die.

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:05.951
So I can shoot you all I want!

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:07.988
[DOFLAMINGO screams]

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:10.126
--Doffy!
--Doffy!

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:14.969
You monsters! We're human!

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:18.076
But you treat us like we're
nothing more than insects!

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:21.583
Have you ever known grief,
even once in your life?

00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:23.687
Have you felt agony?

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.991
Well, we're gonna
show it to you!

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.898
[COMMONERS shouting]

Cu-lick.

[DOFLAMINGO]
What is it?

00:08:26.813 --> 00:08:29.051
[DOFLAMINGO]
Law did what?

00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:32.223
[DOFLAMINGO]
All right.

00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:33.092

Cu-lick.

[WORLD NOBLE A]
Have you gone mad, St. Homing?

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:52.197
Surely, you haven't
thought this through!

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.867
[WORLD NOBLE B]
Why would a man in your position

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.372
reject your divine right
to live as a human?

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:59.378
But we are human, are we not?

00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:00.548
[WORLD NOBLE A]
Don't include us in that

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:01.983
ludicrous statement, you fool!

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:05.524
You take that right back!
That accusation's blasphemy!

00:09:05.558 --> 00:09:06.860
You filthy traitor!

00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:09.666
We've always known you
to be a raving heretic!

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.703
[WORLD NOBLE D]
He's right. You're a traitor!

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:13.372
You may say what you like.

00:09:13.405 --> 00:09:15.143
I love humans.

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:16.813
Their efforts charm me.

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:19.051
I find their
lifestyle enchanting.

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:22.759
That's why I would like to
step down from my status.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:25.664
I believe the experience
will be fulfilling.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.371
[WORLD NOBLE B gasps]
Have you lost your mind?

00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:30.675
[WORLD NOBLE A]
How obscene!

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:33.780
[WORLD NOBLE C]
Leave Marie Jois at once!

[GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL A]
This is as far as we are

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:38.523
permitted to take you.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:39.960
We're in the northern
end of our parameters

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:42.230
and approaching
a region unaffiliated

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:44.434
with the World Government.

have been prepared for you.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.645
[HOMING] Thank you. This should
be more than adequate.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.714
[GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL A]
Now, please hand over

00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:54.020
your Celestial Dragon ID chips.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.509
Well, this is it,
we'll live humbly.

00:10:04.543 --> 00:10:06.312
This should be fun. Right?

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:09.251
Indeed! Shall we unpack?

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:12.357
[DOFLAMINGO]
Where are the slaves, Daddy?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.667
Shouldn't they be the ones
to unpack? It's their job.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.338
If they ran away,
we should buy some new ones.

00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:24.114
[HOMING sighs]
Doffy. Rosinante.

00:10:24.147 --> 00:10:25.651
Things will be
different from now on.

I must teach you.

Come on, son.

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:41.448
No, you come on!
This is peasants-ware!

00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:43.821
Plus I'll stink
if I wear this junk!

00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:45.691
[HOMING]
I'm gonna need you to calm down.

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:48.229
We're humans from
this day forward.

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:49.164
[DOFLAMINGO]
Humans?

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:50.333
Uh-huh, from now on,

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:53.740
we shall leave our old
lives back in Marie Jois.

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:57.549
A simpler life will be
much more fulfilling.

Here are your apples, ma'am.

Hello there! I would like to
purchase some fruit please.

Oh. Sure! You new here?

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:12.077
Yes! We are!

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.716
We just arrived here from Marie
Jois to be honest with you.

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:18.056

Pleased to meet you.

Are you a Celestial Dragon then?

We're humans now.

Please, don't worry.

00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:31.983
Our titles were cast off.

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:36.491
We came here to start a new life
and make friends with you all!

You buffoons shouldn't
mess with me!

Where are the Celestial Dragons?

kneeling before me?

[HOMING gasps]

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:19.011
[COMMONER A] They're not here!
They must have fled. Find them!

They can't have gone too far!

at least the rain let up.

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:08.910
And we seem to have lost track
of the angry mob chasing us.

Let's stay put
for the time being.

How can you expect us to
live in this filthy box?

00:13:15.825 --> 00:13:17.160
There are bugs everywhere,

00:13:17.194 --> 00:13:20.366
and this rotten stench
is gonna make me hurl!

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:33.158
[DOFLAMINGO snoring]

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:39.872
[COMMONER A] They must still
be nearby! Find that family!

00:13:39.905 --> 00:13:41.142
[HOMING gasps]

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.980
[COMMONER A]
They're gonna die!

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:46.351
We should leave. Quickly.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:10.466
[HOMING]
I could have never predicted

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.538
this would turn out so poorly.

00:14:12.572 --> 00:14:14.174
I was far too optimistic.

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:16.746
So please. Just take us back.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:18.784
Even just my wife and children.

00:14:18.817 --> 00:14:21.823
They deserve to return,
at the very least.

00:14:22.524 --> 00:14:26.098
[HOMING] I fear if we stay here
any longer, we'll be slain.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.335
[WORLD NOBLE A] What has been
abandoned cannot be returned.

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:30.239
You chose this life
for yourself.

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:32.544
And don't you dare
call us again.

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:34.683
You worthless human filth.

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:36.886
[HOMING]
W-Wait! I beg you!

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.422
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Cu-lick.

00:14:42.096 --> 00:14:44.334
[PIRATES chuckle]

00:14:44.368 --> 00:14:46.005
Damn bread thieves!

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:51.082
[PIRATES laughing]

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:52.284
[DOFLAMINGO]
Daddy...

00:14:52.317 --> 00:14:56.291
For the first time
in my life, I feel pain.

00:15:01.803 --> 00:15:02.939
[DOFLAMINGO]
Daddy.

00:15:02.972 --> 00:15:06.679
For the first time
in my life, I'm hungry.

00:15:12.691 --> 00:15:17.266
[DOFLAMINGO] Eat up quick, Rocy!
Before someone comes!

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.274
[DOFLAMINGO] Mommy,
we brought you some food.

00:15:21.308 --> 00:15:22.812
[DOFLAMINGO'S MOTHER]
Doffy. Rocy.

00:15:22.845 --> 00:15:24.147
[DOFLAMINGO'S MOTHER coughs]

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.085
[ROSINANTE, DOFLAMINGO]
You okay?

00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:30.160
I'm sorry, boys. I feel unwell.

00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:32.632
[DOFLAMINGO'S MOTHER coughs]

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:39.645
[ROSINANTE crying]

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:47.594
[DOFLAMINGO]
Daddy. Mother... is dead.

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:51.970
[COMMONER M]
We found 'em!

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.040
Not my boys! Have mercy!

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:56.612
They're children. Let them go!

00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:01.556
Please! Please!

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:07.133
[HOMING crying]

00:16:10.574 --> 00:16:12.243
[DOFLAMINGO]
Daddy!

00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:29.110
[DOFLAMINGO]
You bastard!

00:16:29.144 --> 00:16:35.322
You did this to us!

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.701
[GIOLLA] Young Master,
we have apprehended Law.

00:16:40.734 --> 00:16:44.709
It seems like the boy was
trying to make a run for it.

00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:47.213
Dammit! Let me go!

00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:50.086
At the port. Tried flee-een'.

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:51.187
[BUFFALO]
What kinda punishment

00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:53.191
do you think they'll
use on him, huh?

00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:56.331
Dunno. Sure feel bad
for him, though.

00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:59.470
[gasps]

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:04.648
[LAW]
Corazon!

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:08.856
[LAW]
Damn! That didn't take him out!

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.328
Now they gonna
kill me for nothing.

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.868
I thought bribing Buffalo with
ice cream would cover it up.

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:17.440
But that scumbag
Cora ratted me out!

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:21.114
I could have sworn I stabbed
him right through his body!

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:23.953
But he's acting like
nothing happened!

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:28.763
[DOFLAMINGO] Law. I called you
to discuss something.

00:17:28.796 --> 00:17:30.266
Can you guess?

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:34.174
I wanted to welcome you to the
Don Quixote Family, officially.

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:35.811
Congrats, kid.

00:17:35.844 --> 00:17:36.813
[LAW]
Huh?

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.082
[BUFFALO]
Huh?!

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:39.885
Welcome home, Law!

00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:42.189
[GIOLLA]
Ahh.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.697
[DOFLAMINGO]
Just looking at you,

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.236
I can tell you've been
through hell and back.

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:51.809
You have that hate-filled
glare in your eyes.

00:17:53.914 --> 00:17:56.986
[DOFLAMINGO] I think you'll have
a lot to offer our Family.

00:17:57.019 --> 00:18:00.594
[GIOLLA laughs]
You hear that! Lovely!

00:18:00.627 --> 00:18:04.768
Young Master is a brilliant
judge of character!

00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:07.842
[LAW] Does he not know about
me stabbing Corazon yet?

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.377
Why not?

00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:12.416
He could have just written it
out on a piece of paper for him.

00:18:13.219 --> 00:18:15.724
[LAW]
What exactly is he planning?

00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:18.597
Yeah, whatever.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.769
I got three years,
and then I'm gonna die.

00:18:21.802 --> 00:18:23.372
The end. Done.

00:18:23.406 --> 00:18:27.614
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Maybe. Depends on your luck.

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:29.451
[LAW]
Luck?

00:18:29.484 --> 00:18:31.155
[DOFLAMINGO]
Allow me to explain.

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:33.492
We're what you'd call
"experts" in the black market,

00:18:33.526 --> 00:18:35.931
and one of our fields
is Devil Fruits.

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.199
Their powers are vast,

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:39.572
sometimes beyond
human comprehension.

00:18:39.605 --> 00:18:41.208
Meaning, there may
be a Devil Fruit

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.179
that could cure your condition.

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:44.649
Devil Fruits, huh?

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:47.487
[DOFLAMINGO] So what?
You have three years left!

00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:50.393
Who knows how many Devil Fruits
we'll find in that time.

00:18:50.426 --> 00:18:51.596
And one of them just might have

00:18:51.629 --> 00:18:54.636
a life-altering
solution for you.

00:18:54.669 --> 00:18:56.505
But for the time being,

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:59.010
I'd like to train you
to be my right-hand man.

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:00.881
Ten years from now.

You take care of 'em?

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:20.185
Very good then.
Now, patch that up.

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:25.295

Did Cora just cover for me?

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:30.507
[LAW] Why? What's
going on in his head?

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.015
We'll head towards Reverse
Mountain in the South.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.451

moving our base,

00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:39.290

C'mon, we told our real names.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.856
So what? It's not like I asked.

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:04.494
Aww, lame! You meanie.

00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:07.968
Why does it matter?
I'll be dead soon enough.

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:09.337
Maybe. You're paler.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.807
You feel sick?

00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:13.411
I'm fine for now, I guess.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:18.923
But before too long,
I'll be gone.

00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:20.192
In that case,

00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:22.665
it's one more reason to
reveal your real name!

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:23.733
Just say it!

00:21:23.767 --> 00:21:26.673
Or I'll tell everyone
that you stabbed Cora!

00:21:26.706 --> 00:21:28.341
Spit it out!

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:42.036
Tell no one.

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:44.542
I'm actually not supposed to
let people hear my full name.

So just stick to "Law."
I don't use code names like you.

I just hide some parts.

We don't care.

[LAW] I only told you because
you were harassing me!

00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:07.554

Aww. He's gonna get

[ROSINANTE]
Your secret name's "D."?

in search of a doctor to cure

After a long, painful road

Corazon suddenly
breaks into tears
