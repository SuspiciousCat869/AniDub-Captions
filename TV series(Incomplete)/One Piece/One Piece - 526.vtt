00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.804
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.807
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.543
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.912
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.080
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.248
You can have it!

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.018
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.387
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.356
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.192
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.791
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece,

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.728
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:46.933
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.202
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.470
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.772
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.707
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.110
this has proven to
be the end of road.

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.512
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.414 --> 00:03:03.783
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey
D. Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:06.052
became rubber after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.722
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:13.760
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:17.897
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:20.066
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.068
Scattered across the world,
Luffy and his crew

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.904
underwent special training to
prepare for the trials ahead.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.940
Now, thousands of feet
below sea level,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.075
they set sail to the next
step in their journey:

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.678
Fishman Island.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.847
My turn. Gum-Gum...

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.784
Elephant Gun!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.092
[WADATSUMI]
Hey, that's naughty!

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.995
You know better, Ankoro! Ugh!

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.097
You're not allowed to eat ships!

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.100
Wait. Did he just help us?

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.936
Who freaking cares? Let's
just make a break for it!

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.005
He might change his mind!

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:06.312
[gasps] Oh, please, no more!

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.151
[LUFFY]
"Undersea Volcanic Eruption!

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.587
Drifting to the Fishman Island!"

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.664
[DECKEN exhales, inhales]

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:28.568
[DECKEN] Dead men tell no tales,
and dead men have no needs...

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.303
[BROOK]
Is that me?

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.039
[DECKEN] I pluck the rings
right off their hands

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:36.009
within these shadowy seas.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:41.080
Dead men have no regrets
and no tears left to weep.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.916
I'll pluck the crowns
right off their heads

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.819
within this cold, black deep.

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.722
Sunken treasures
free for the taking!

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:52.358
A king of pirates in the making!

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:56.329
I leave my enemies,
weeping and shaking!

00:04:56.362 --> 00:05:01.334
Vander Decken is my name,
and these long-lost riches

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.436
I do claim!

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.905
[FLYING PIRATES cheer]

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.808
[screams] Go away!

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.780
[gasps] No, it can't be!

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.618
[CHOPPER whimpers]

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.388
[screams] It's a ghost ship!

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:25.358
You are the last one
who should be scared!

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.094
You can't get with
these moves! Whoo!

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:34.934
[USOPP]
No. No!

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.404
[GROUP]
It's a ghost ship!

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.747
Tell us that thing isn't real!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.549
Tell us it's like your ship!

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:54.053
Nothing would make me happier,
but take a look at their sail!

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.423
That's the legendary
Flying Dutchmen !

00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.560
It shouldn't be here!
It shouldn't exist!

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:05.131
As the story goes, it sailed
the seas hundreds of years ago.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:07.166
One dark and stormy night,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.303
the captain of the ship
suddenly lost his mind.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:13.272
Consumed with madness,
he threw his own crew-mates

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.575
into the sea, one after another.

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.477
Then, he turned his
gaze to the heavens

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.612
and cursed the very gods!

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.280
The captain's name
was none other

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.982
than Vander Decken,

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:25.251
and the ship was
the Flying Dutchman .

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:28.287
The gods condemned
him for his actions,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.090
and he was cursed
for all eternity.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.128
Sailing the seas, aimlessly,
there on that very vessel!

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.929
[BROOK] Even if you're
a skeleton who has sailed

00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:39.799
on a ghost ship of your own,
the sight of the Flying Dutchman

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:42.468
will put chills down your spine!

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:44.637
[USOPP, CHOPPER scream]

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.972
Stop screaming!

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.141
We thought Brook's ship
was scary when we saw it;

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:49.442
look how that turned out!

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.511
There was a logical explanation!

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:54.280
And sure, some of his jokes
are so bad you could scream,

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:55.848
but that's the worst of it.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.951
[laughs] You're so cold!

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:02.321
Almost like you're made
of metal! Get it?

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:03.456
Franky's right!

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:04.791
The ship may look spooky,

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.693
but that doesn't mean
the scary story is real!

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.630
[ROBIN] Perhaps, but the
Kraken is a legend as well,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.465
and it just attacked our ship.

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.834
This is all uncharted
territory for us.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.370
I mean who's to say what's
real and what's not?

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:18.838
[NAMI]
Uh--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.745
[NAMI]
If Robin says it's real...

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:28.414
...then it's gotta be!
We're doomed!

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.716
Someone hold me!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.853
Robin, don't torment the crew
just so you can have a laugh.

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.321
We're in real trouble here!

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.422
[ROBIN giggles]

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.558
[FLYING PIRATE A] Good news,
Captain Vander Decken!

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.260
Wadatsumi and Ankoro are
bringing in the pirate ship!

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.329
Foolish humans, all of them,

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:46.666
but the ship does
look rather nice.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.901
And their treasure
will look even nicer

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:51.337
once it's in my hands! [laughs]

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.907
Luffy! Please, come back!

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.610
Yeah, Zoro and Sanji, too!

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.783
You got me!

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.586
What, are my giant muscles
not good enough to protect ya?

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.254
Either way, we gotta
pull it together

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:11.023
so we're still alive
when they do come back!

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.092
[NAMI]
It's getting hotter and hotter.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:14.694
That's not normal.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.872
[NAMI]
That can only mean...

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:28.608
[DECKEN] Listen up, I'm not
digging their treasure

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.444
out of your stomachs,
so no eating the ship!

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.813
Just give it a good knock!

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:37.049
You betcha!

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:39.285
[USOPP] I think we're
about to get pounded!

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:41.320
[CHOPPER]
Well, sure! He's our enemy!

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.689
Franky, we need
a Coup De Burst! Now!

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:46.626
[FRANKY] I can't! We used
up all our fuel already!

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.627
That means we're on our own

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.795
till I can restock
the cola supply!

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.631
[WADATSUMI yells]

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.466
[BOTH scream]

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.201
Do something!

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.636
Help me!

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.170
We're dead!

[STRAW HATS yelling]

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.185
What?!

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.527
That's The Monster of
the Arctic. The Kraken.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.732
[WADATSUMI]
You big bully!

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.782
[LUFFY] All right, he learned
his lesson. Enough!

00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.122
[LUFFY]
Good boy!

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.862

I thought you were dead!

That was so scary!

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.971
What the heck happened to you?

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:08.708
Nami-swan! Robin!

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:12.211
It was crazy, that's for sure!

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:14.814
They got lost. Morons.

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:16.782
They're hopeless without me.

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:23.756
Sanji, no! He's having
a girl-crazy relapse!

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.257
We'll have to build
up his tolerance

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.393
with some less
stimulating pictures.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.895
[DECKEN]
You gonna take that, Wadatsumi?

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.298
Get back up! Avenge yourself!

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.766
Start swinging!

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:36.469
[WADATSUMI groans]

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.571
[LUFFY] My bubble popped
and so did Sanji's,

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:43.275
so we all had to crowd inside
Zoro's before we drowned!

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.810
We were running outta air!

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.079
How 'bout you stop
scaring us like that?

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.348
Now a song for you, Captain.

were gone forever!

[FRANKY] If you survived that,
you can survive anything!

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:02.762
[NAMI] No kidding,
and you tamed the Kraken

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:06.098
just like you said.
I thought you were nuts!

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:09.201
[ROBIN laughs] So, is he
going to be our new guide?

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.403
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:12.471
If that goopy dude can have
a sea monster pull his ship,

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.440
then we can have
Surume pull the Sunny .

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.675
Right, pal?

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.044
[USOPP] Of course, you would
name it already, wouldn't you?

to give it such a name, ♪

forward. Let's go!

wants to give us a free ride.

But make sure he
doesn't crush us

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:14.800

Pull back, men!

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.440

Okay, Captain, sure!

[FLYING PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:38.190
Oh, no!

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.359
Luffy, I don't know
how the Kraken works,

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:43.529
but order him to turn

Hey, Surume!

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:47.066
Wait a sec.

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.237
[USOPP] He's hauling ass
just fine all on his own.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.039
For such a giant monster,
it's kind of shameful, actually.

Who cares?

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.176
I would be doing the same thing!

He runs terribly.

Give him a break!

I'd rather be clumsy and alive
than graceful and dead!

be boiled alive down here!

Ooh, riding him is pretty fun,

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.800

be even better!

The temperature change--

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.874
it's causing a vortex
in the current!

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:38.177
[SANJI] Nami, which direction
is Fishman Island?

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.645
We can't lose our wa--

You're not ready for
real girls yet, Sanji!

Go back to your

Straight ahead. I have an idea!

No!

That's not a place you jump!

It's an abyss!

[CHOPPER] Yeah, there's nothing
but blackness down there!

They've gotta be insane!

And the void in front of us!
Help! Can't we go up?

Up, where it's not
burning and dark

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:01.927
and everything wants to kill us?

Wait!

You're not really
Luffy, are you?

You're some evil demon
who looks like him

to the depths of hell!

It's an avalanche!
Brace yourselves!

The eruption knocked
the rocks loose!

If one of those hits us,
then the Sunny 's done for!

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.350

we weren't crushed to death!

Dodge the boulders, Surume!

I can't just sit here;
I'm gonna go cut 'em!

pressure will crush you!

We don't have to
destroy anything.

very long, though.

Hey, wipe up that drool
and tell Surume to go.

00:22:26.144 --> 00:22:27.779
There's an entrance
around here somewhere

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:28.780
and we've gotta find it.

00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:31.383
Guys! We got company!

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.053
[roars]

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:37.155
[screams]

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.524
Well, crap. That's not good.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:46.965
[NAMI]
Sea monsters! Giant ones!

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.400
[ALL scream]

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:52.070
So, close! And now we're dead!

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:59.544
[LUFFY]
Wow! They look tough!

00:22:59.578 --> 00:23:01.880
I want one!

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.522
[LUFFY]
Wait, is somebody riding 'em?

00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:15.160
[NARRATOR] Although Fishman
Island is in sight,

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:17.696
Luffy's descent is halted
by cruel fishmen

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.998
riding atop massive
sea monsters.

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:22.234
Calling themselves the
New Fishman Pirates,

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:25.404
they speak of Luffy's
old adversary, Arlong.

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:27.272
Running out of time,
the Straw Hats attempt

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.174
a desperate maneuver
to propel themselves

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:32.210
straight into their
destination at any cost.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:33.879
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:37.349
"Landing at the Fishman Island!
Beautiful Mermaids!"

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:39.885
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
