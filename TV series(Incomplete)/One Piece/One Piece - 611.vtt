00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:02.221
Dr. Vegapunk tried
creating one himself.

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.090
[SUBORDINATE B] I heard
it was a failure, though.

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:06.659
Me, too, but he
made something here.

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:12.398
[MOMONOSUKE yelling]

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:16.836
[panting] That pain in
my chest was overwhelming!

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:19.105
I feared that my
heart might burst!

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.307
[pants] I was running
at a great speed,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.109
but something feels strange.

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:24.844
My legs, feel like...

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.479
Uh.

00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:32.451
Huh?!

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.788
[MOMONOSUKE grunting]

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:40.826
[screaming]

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.217
[MOMONOSUKE]
So, I was a human...

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:09.388
...once at least.

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:12.491
I see. So you ate a Devil Fruit.

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.093
The Eel Eel Fruit?

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.295
You fool. Look closer.

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.097
Eels do not have horns.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.331
Well, no biggie.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.767
Why don't ya use your power
to turn back to normal?

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.735
What?

00:13:22.768 --> 00:13:26.238
It's really that simple?
So I can do that?

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.640
Teach me how!

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:32.044
Sorry. I can't. I don't
have Zoan powers, y'know.

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.480
Man, I can't even see
the hole I fell through.

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:38.083
How high does that
ceiling go up, anyway?

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:40.519
I am eager to escape
this place as well.

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:43.556
The children must be
informed of the truth.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:45.658
I heard something dreadful.

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:47.126
Huh?

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:51.163
Caesar--he unwittingly
revealed a dark secret.

00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:59.905
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:03.175
[CAESAR CLOWN] Yes, the
children are quite obedient.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.476
[MOMONOSUKE]
Uh?

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:10.182
[CAESAR CLOWN] They're enlarging
with no particular side effects.

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.685
But of course, I don't
expect that to last long,

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.420
since the purpose
of this experiment

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:17.523
is to test the
limits of dosage size.

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:18.257
[MOMONOSUKE grunts]

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.425
Well, at any rate,

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:23.262
I'm sure they'll all die off
in about five years or so.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:25.030
[laughs]

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:28.701
Hopefully no one will catch on
and we can bring in a new batch.

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:31.303
Failure is part
of experimentation.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:33.606
A necessary sacrifice.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:36.876
Nothing wrong with donating
your body to science after all.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:39.912
It's just, in this
case, it's mandatory.

00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:43.349
All for the good of the
world, or for me at least.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:45.651
Besides, it's not like
the little ignoramuses

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:48.554
were going to do anything
useful with their lives, right?

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:51.724
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:56.662
That man's kindness
is nothing but a facade!

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.931
He will drive those children to
an early grave

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.000
without even an ounce of regret!

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.903
And they know nothing.

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:04.904
You hungry?

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:05.738
[MOMONOSUKE grunts]

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:07.907
[MOCHA]
Here, have a snack.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.277
It's sad, but we all
know how you feel.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.078
'Cause we're the same way.

00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:15.247
Everyone wants to
see their family.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.883
We all wanna go
home really soon.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:23.355
I can't leave them to die.
I must aid them.

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:27.192
Yes. On my honor as
a warrior, I'll fight!

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.460
In truth,

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:30.729
I was already on my way to warn
them of their present danger,

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:31.931
but when I hid in a trash can,

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:34.066
I fell down to this
wretched place.

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.735
[LUFFY growls]

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.537
Caesar!

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.872
[MOMONOSUKE grunts]

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:46.378
[LUFFY] All right, Momo. We're
wasting too much time in here.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:47.846
I'm getting us out!

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.884
How? You remarked yourself
on the height of the ceiling!

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.686
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna climb.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.220
Hold on to my back.

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:56.855
[gasps]

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:00.192
[LUFFY] And don't worry about
the kids, they'll be fine.

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:03.028
My friends are on
their way to help them.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:04.463
Is that true?

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.433
Yeah, and they always
keep their word.

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.670
Just worry about
yourself for now.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.872
[MOMONOSUKE chuckles]
I see.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.474
I was right after all.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:19.611
You are no lowly pirate,
but a valiant...

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:22.314
[MOMONOSUKE groans]

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:25.651
What's wrong?

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:28.787
Momo! Do you need food?

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.289
C'mon buddy, get up!

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:33.592
You gotta pull it
together, okay?

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:37.129
Hey, stay with me! Are you
listenin'? Hang in there!

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.931
You gotta pull it together!

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:42.534
Pull it together!
Pull it together!

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:48.707
[DOFLAMINGO] Pull it
together! Pull it together!

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:50.943
Pull it together!

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:53.645
Pull it together!

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.714
[screams]

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:56.648
What's wrong?

[MOMONOSUKE yelling]

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:03.188
Uh, hey?

[continues yelling]

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.033
[LUFFY]
Momo? Calm down!

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.067

[LUFFY]
Hello?

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:20.105

[USOPP, KIN'EMON panting]

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.300
Hope Nami's team's
doing okay without me.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:52.037
I mean, they've got Zoro,
but he's no Usopp!

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.606
I vow to save you, Momonosuke!

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.676
Stay strong, son.
It won't be long now!

00:17:57.709 --> 00:18:01.280
Hey, Brook! Look around for
some Sea Prism Stone handcuffs!

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:02.881
Robin said we're
gonna need them!

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.149
Worry not, Sir Corpse,

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.752
I shall take care of
your body in your absence!

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:09.488
[BROOK cackles]
Just count on me!

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.924
One samurai's son and
a few pair of handcuffs!

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:14.960
I would imagine both of them
must be somewhere close by.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:17.729
Let's just slip through
this wall, first!

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.234
His name's Momonosuke, right?

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.069
I imagine he dresses
like his father,

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:28.340
so he shouldn't be difficult
to pick out of a crowd. Huh...

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:32.678
Hey! Little samurai boy?

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:43.655
[VERGO] There's no getting
through my Armament Haki.

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:47.192
You should know by now this
won't end well for you.

[VERGO]
You're not a fool, Smoker.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:57.803
Stop this nonsense before
you force me to kill you.

Vergo.

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.745
[VERGO]
What do you have to gain?

00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.280
Is this some misguided attempt

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:11.250
to avenge the death
of those scumbags?

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.756
[SMOKER grunts] They may be
a bit rough around the edges,

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:20.292
but they're better
Marines than you'll ever be!

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.227
And those boys can take a punch,

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.164
so I wouldn't write
them off just yet.

I'm surprised, Smoker.

I never took you for the
sentimental type.

Are you so stinkin' lazy you'd
rather die from poison gas

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.958
than hustle for
once in your life?

I think Black Leg is going
to kick us all to death

gets to us-- [screams]

now!

We've got some kids to save!

It's cold! This whole
room is a blizzard!

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:06.932
As soon as I take my coat off,
that bird woman makes it snow!

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.533
I am gonna choke her!

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:12.371
Stop! You guys can't eat
that candy no matter what!

Run away, Mocha, go!

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.208
Just give us the candy!

You can't run forever, y'know!

You're crazy! All of
this just for candy?

[ROBIN groans]

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.125

be Pirate Hunter Zoro.

a rather massive bounty!

to stop those kids!

You're a Logia-type, huh?

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:10.062
All right, then. Bring it on!

00:22:16.535 --> 00:22:19.604
[NARRATOR] Monet uses her
snow powers to toy with Zoro.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:21.840
But the swordsman
valiantly holds his ground

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:24.676
in order to help Nami and her
companions to escape.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.712
Then, just as things
are looking up,
