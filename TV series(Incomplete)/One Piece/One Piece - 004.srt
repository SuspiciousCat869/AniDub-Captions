00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,210
See you later, pansies.

177
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,389
Captain, are you okay?

178
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,190
Are you hurt?

179
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,227
Not a problem in
the world, Makino.

180
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,397
‐‐[SHANKS chuckles]
‐‐[PIRATES laugh]

181
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,399
That fella really
got you good, boss!

182
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,867
[PIRATE Q]
Talk about a loser!

183
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,937
[SHANKS laughing]

184
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,206
Why are you all laughing?!

185
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,407
What's so funny?!

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,776
You should've
fought back, Shanks!

187
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,611
It doesn't matter
how strong they look

188
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,213
or how many of them there are,

189
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,448
if you just laugh it off,
you're not a man

190
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,917
or a pirate!

191
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,921
Look, Luffy, I know
how you feel.

192
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,390
But the guy just
spilled some booze on me.

193
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,559
It's not worth getting
bent out of shape.

194
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,793
[LUFFY]
Whatever!

195
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,800
‐‐[MAKINO, SHANKS laugh]
‐‐[chomp]

196
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,736
[SHANKS laughs] You shouldn't
eat out of frustration, Luffy.

197
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,971
[LUFFY]
Shut up!

198
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,573
[gasps]

199
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,241
[SHANKS]
Wait! What're you eating?

200
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:36,742
[LUFFY gasps]

201
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,910
No! You didn't‐‐

202
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,413
Don't tell me you ate the fruit
that was inside that box?!

203
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,747
[LUFFY]
Uh... I...

204
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,815
[LUFFY screams]

205
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,318
[SHANKS] Spit it out
right now! Every single bit!

206
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,452
[LUFFY]
What're you doing?

207
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,287
Why're you shaking me?!

208
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,432
What's going on?

209
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,767
Luffy, you just ate
the Gum‐Gum Fruit,

210
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,436
part of a group called
the Devil Fruits.

211
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,770
Eating any of them takes away

212
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,939
your ability to swim for
the rest of your life,

213
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,775
but the one you ate also
turns your body to rubber!

214
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,511
[LUFFY]
No way! It can't!

215
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,614
[SHANKS]
You dumbass!

216
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,361
[MAKINO panting]

217
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,462
[LUFFY groans]

218
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,698
[HIGUMA]
What is this?

219
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,334
We were drinking and
having a nice time...

220
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,803
...until you showed up.

221
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,472
You apologize!

222
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,040
No one messes with Shanks' crew!

223
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
[MAKINO panting]

224
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,811
[HIGUMA] I don't think I said
anything to offend you directly.

225
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,480
[LUFFY]
You think wrong!

226
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,814
Now apologize!

227
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,516
Mayor! Help me!

228
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,651
[MAYOR]
Hm?

229
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,519
[BOTH panting]

230
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,321
[BANDIT A laughs]

231
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,523
[BANDIT A] Did you see the
looks on those pirate's faces?

232
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,691
‐‐[BANDIT A laughing]
‐‐[BANDIT B] Yeah!

233
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,494
They got doused in liquor
and didn't even say a word.

234
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,528
How pathetic.

235
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,064
[HIGUMA] Pirates are a
buncha wimps, nothing more.

236
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,999
They're all talk, no action.

237
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,501
[LUFFY]
Stop it!

238
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,702
[HIGUMA]
Huh?

239
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,338
[LUFFY] Stop making fun of
Shanks and his men right now!

240
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,673
They're not wimps at all!

241
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674
[MAKINO]
Luffy, no!

242
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,742
[LUFFY growls]

243
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,046
[LUFFY] You better stop right
now, you stupid bandits!

244
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,881
[MAKINO, MAYOR pant, gasp]

245
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,686
[HIGUMA] You should watch
your flapping gums, kid.

246
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,020
No one who's ever made me mad

247
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,590
has lived to tell the
horrifying and painful tale.

248
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,759
[MAYOR]
Wait! Hold on!

249
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,094
Let the boy go!

250
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,062
I beg you!

251
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,064
[LUFFY gasping]

252
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,198
[MAYOR]
I don't know what he's done,

253
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,068
and I certainly don't intend
to fight you over it.

254
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,870
If you'll accept, I'll
even pay you to stop this.

255
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,040
Just spare the poor
boy's life, please!

256
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,875
Mayor!

257
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,377
While the oldest generation

258
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,879
may know the way of the
world better than us all,

259
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,916
I'm sorry, but this rotten
kid's already made me angry.

260
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,751
Nothing can save him now.

261
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,555
You're the rotten
ones around here!

262
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,958
And you're a lost cause...

263
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,561
...which you can regret
in the next life.

264
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,462
‐‐[MAKINO] No!
‐‐[MAYOR] Please!

265
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,731
You have to let him go!

266
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,568
I was wondering why the bar
was empty on such a fine day.

267
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,402
[MAKINO gasps]

268
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,738
So, it's the mountain
bandits again.

269
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,573
Captain Shanks!

270
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,475
[HIGUMA]
Eh?

271
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,643
[LUFFY groaning]

272
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,645
[LUFFY]
Shanks...

273
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,370
Pirates.

274
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,539
You're just now
showing your heads?

275
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,208
Have you been spending all this
time scrubbing the village?

276
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,210
Luffy. Didn't you say earlier

277
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,312
that your punches were
stronger than pistols?

278
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,047
Shut your mouth!

279
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,683
Listen, I don't know what
you think you're doing here,

280
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,519
but you might wanna leave.

281
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,554
You wouldn't want
something bad to happen.

282
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,991
And I have just the man
to deliver this message.

283
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,226
I'll blow your head
off if I have to,

284
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,028
but that's up to you, my friend.

285
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,330
[BANDITS laughing]

286
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,166
[HIGUMA chuckles]

287
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,070
Would you risk your life?

288
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,372
Huh?

289
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,706
Now that' you've
drawn your pistol,

290
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,742
are you willing to use it?

291
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,744
What the hell are
you talking about?

292
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,347
I'm saying that guns aren't for
threats; they're for actions.

293
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,059
[BANDITS gasp]

294
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,227
[MAKINO, MAYOR gasp]

295
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,228
[LUFFY gasps]

296
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,063
You! You're a dead man!

297
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,598
These guys fight dirty.

298
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,532
Dirty?

299
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,601
Who did you think you
were dealing with?

300
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,370
We never claimed to
be saints or anything.

301
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,106
You fellas are staring
down a crew of pirates.

302
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:01,774
Shut up!

303
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,443
We just want the boy, not you!

304
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,278
[SHANKS]
Listen up, bandits.

305
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,381
Whether I'm sprayed with
alcohol or doused with food,

306
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,417
hell, even if I'm spit on,
most of the time,

307
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,119
I'll just laugh it off
and forget about it.

308
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,088
But if you hurt
a friend of mine,

309
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,058
you'll pay for it,
regardless of your reason.

310
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,260
[LUFFY]
Shanks...

311
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,728
[HIGUMA laughs]

312
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,630
So we're gonna pay?

313
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,398
Lousy pirates.

314
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,633
Kill 'em all, men!

315
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,568
[BANDITS yell]

316
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,137
[BEN] I'll take care of this.
Shouldn't be a big deal.

317
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,739
[BANDITS yell]

318
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,642
‐‐[BEN grunts]
‐‐[BANDITS grunt, groan]

319
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,480
[HIGUMA gasps]

320
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,816
[BEN]
You shouldn't get too cocky.

321
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,652
If you really wanted to fight
us, looks like a battleship

322
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,822
or something bigger
woulda been more useful.

323
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,657
Wow.

324
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:52,758
[HIGUMA stammers]

325
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,326
Hold on, please!

326
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,128
It was the kid who attacked us!

327
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,596
I thought you were
a wanted man.

328
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,831
[HIGUMA whimpers]

329
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,100
[HIGUMA yells]

330
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,601
A smokescreen.

331
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,606
[SHANKS]
Luffy?!

332
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,674
Oh no!

333
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,776
I let that guy take him!

334
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,278
What're we gonna do?!

335
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,647
Boss, calm down.
Quit freakin' out.

336
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,615
We'll find him in no time.

337
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,319
[BEN]
Heh. What a guy.

338
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,121
[HIGUMA laughs]

339
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,456
[HIGUMA] Looks like
I made a clean getaway.

340
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,457
They'd never think to look

341
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,359
for a mountain bandit
escaping onto the ocean.

342
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,329
[LUFFY] Dammit! Let go
of me, you dumbass idiot!

343
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,797
I really hope you die!

344
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:35,334
[chuckles] Yes, I know
that's what you want.

345
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,469
But you're the one dying today.

346
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,705
Remember what I said
about makin' me angry?

347
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,206
[LUFFY]
Ah!

348
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,641
[LUFFY]
Dammit! Dammit!

349
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,512
Filthy bandit scum and I
