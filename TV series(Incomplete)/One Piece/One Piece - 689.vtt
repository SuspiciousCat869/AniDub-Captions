00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.803
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:16.960
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:18.764
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.797 --> 00:03:21.202
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:23.774
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:26.580
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:29.218
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.122
a barrier known as
the "Birdcage,"

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.259
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:34.696
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.267
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.405
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:42.812
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:43.948
They keep coming.

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.485
Then I'll keep punching!

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.589
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:49.726
[KELLY]
Hey, you buncha crap bags.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.732
Keep yer' paws off
Straw Hat or else!

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:54.803
Rah Rah Rah Rampage!

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:57.809
[KELLY] Anyway, I found
a shortcut you can use.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:03:59.847
Huh? Seriously?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.119
See that? Shortcut! Told ya!

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.388
[LUFFY gasps]

00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:07.060
[KELLY] What're you
waiting for? Go ahead.

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:09.332
I'll stay here and
keep watch for you.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:11.035
Thanks! Sounds awesome!

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:12.672
Moocy, let's go!

00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:15.310
[BULL moos]

00:04:17.114 --> 00:04:19.085
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:04:19.118 --> 00:04:20.821
[ROBIN]
Hi, Luffy. It's me.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:21.890
[LUFFY]
Robin!

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:24.763
Good news. Viola found
the key to the cuffs.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:25.832
Let's meet up.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.034
Oh, awesome!

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:31.041
Luffy, we'll meet at the
Sunflower Field, that's perfect.

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.749
Turn back! This place
is flooded!

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:40.327
[LUFFY gasps]
It's a dead end!

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.231
[LAW]
Get out! Hurry!

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:44.602
[LUFFY]
Don't panic, Moocy!

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.761
[DOFLAMINGO] This is nothing
but a sideways water well.

00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:59.933
More of a trap than
a shortcut, really.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.001
[gasps]

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:07.882
[LUFFY]
It's you! Doflamingo!

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.133
[LUFFY]
"A Great Escape!

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:20.440

[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:40.815
Doflamingo!

00:05:40.848 --> 00:05:44.589
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Look at you two,

00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:47.662
huddled together
in your little hole.

00:05:47.695 --> 00:05:50.968
Should I take those
handcuffs off for you, Law?

00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.807
Or should I cut your
wrists along with them?

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:56.547
I thought you were
at the palace--

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.051
What're you doing down here?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.665
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
I came to rescue you, of course!

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.637
You clearly need help if you're
falling for traps like this.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.744
I'll put you out of your misery.

00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:13.045
Be careful!

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:16.954
[BULL moos]

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:25.236
Moocy!

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.908
Forget the bull! Get away!

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.023
[LUFFY]
Moocy!

00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:42.271
[DOFLAMINGO] Huh. No sense
of self-preservation.

00:06:42.304 --> 00:06:47.080
Don't die, Moocy. It's okay.

00:06:47.114 --> 00:06:50.353
What a joke. Look at you.

00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:53.628
Any clown could kill you
in this sorry state.

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.934
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:59.639
You've riled up quite an
army of idiots out there,

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:02.444
thinking they can take my head.

00:07:03.748 --> 00:07:07.353
[DOFLAMINGO] You are quite adept
at bringing people to your side,

00:07:07.387 --> 00:07:09.659
no matter how foolish
it may seem.

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:11.328
I've admired that
quality of yours

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:15.370
since I saw it on display
during the battle at Marineford.

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:19.378
But now? I see you're
just some fool

00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:21.984
whose luck has finally run out.

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:25.558
Why did you side
with this idiot, Law?

00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:27.094
When you were young,
I thought you showed

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:29.532
a great deal of promise.

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:33.306
Even as a child you were
more cunning than this,

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:38.215
and more ruthless. Am I wrong?

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.124
[DOFLAMINGO]
I'm so disappointed.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:45.130
Who made you into such
a miserable little coward?

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:46.766
That's enough!

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:50.240
Huh?

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:51.676
You listen!

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.783
I'm not gonna be like you!

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:57.789
'Cause I... I've been saved!

00:07:57.822 --> 00:08:02.732
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] By my dear
brother, Corazon, you mean?

00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:08.076
[DOFLAMINGO] You're worse than
a coward. You're useless.

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:11.315
You made a choice,
not only to die in vain,

00:08:11.348 --> 00:08:14.254
but to do it alongside
this imbecile.

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:32.190
Don't you dare! Keep your
hands off Straw Hat!

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:34.529
Or you'll be sorry!

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.095
It's creepy!

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.701
It's not the real thing--
It's just a clone.

--[JEET] Clone?
--A puppet made of string.

of that water already!

It's only his puppet!

why he bothered

to send one all the way here.

Does he want to
taunt us that badly?

He said he was gonna rescue us.

He walked straight
into that one.

[JEET] After we learned
what he was plotting,

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:02.845
we knew we had to stop him!

way behind. It's been a while.

to the Sunflower Field--

Better hurry.

a second, Straw Hat!

them off, one by one.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:55.570
What's that racket?

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.685
There's something big coming up!

00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:08.062
[LUFFY yelling]

00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:12.403
...Elephant Gun! Let's go!

00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:37.487
...Elephant Gun! Let's go!

00:14:42.097 --> 00:14:46.238
[CAVENDISH] What is that?
Someone's fist?

00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:47.373
Well, damn.

00:14:47.406 --> 00:14:51.248
[CHIN JAO chuckles]
That's rather clever of you!

00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:55.089
I'd expect no less
from Garp's grandson.

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:56.225
Ooh!

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:59.063
That must be Straw Hat's doing.

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:02.470
[DELLINGER squeals]

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:06.445
[DELLINGER]
Incoming!

00:15:12.624 --> 00:15:14.695
[GLADIUS]
Straw Hat!

00:15:14.729 --> 00:15:18.335
[laughs] I'm enjoying
this chaos!

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:19.237
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Chin Jao and the others are

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:20.306
headed to the third level!

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:22.377
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Stop them!

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.582
What was all that
rumbling about?

00:15:24.615 --> 00:15:25.584
Aw crap.

00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:27.554
It's coming our way!

00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:29.826
[GLADIUS]
You don't even know what it is!

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:31.596
You have no right to be scared!

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.702
You keep fighting--
Don't lose sight of the enemy!

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.279
Stay focused!

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:49.532
All right! Traffy. Let's go!

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:52.538
[JEET, ABDULLAH] He made
a shortcut with his fist!

00:15:52.572 --> 00:15:53.940
We could've been crushed!

00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:56.680
Hey, guys! You take care
of Moocy for me, okay?

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:57.615
[ABDULLAH, JEET]
Yessir!

00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:00.352
All right! Up we go!

00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:02.858
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
What happened?

00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:06.231
That hole,
it came outta nowhere!

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.337
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G gasps]

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:14.883
A hand?

00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:21.228
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Rocket!

00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.332
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:28.075
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
It's Straw Hat!

00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:38.328
Good! Now we're caught
up with everyone else!

00:16:38.362 --> 00:16:39.164
Get ready!

00:16:39.197 --> 00:16:41.536
Is that Law I see?

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:45.476
What's the hold up? Move it!

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.386
All right. I'm comin'
for you, Mingo!

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:20.379
That's heavy!

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:30.533
Dragon Claw Fist!
Dragon... Claw!

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:36.177
This is one hell of a fight!

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:50.006
I should've known better, huh?

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.143
I can't use smoke
to distract you.

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:54.180
So it would appear.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:58.356
The future of the
Revolutionary Army

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:01.395
is looking quite promising
with you around.

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:03.967
A formidable threat indeed.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.772
Yeah? I question your sincerity.

00:18:23.807 --> 00:18:26.846
Fraland, we're here!

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.184
Huh? What's up, you guys?

00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:31.455
We can help! Listen up!

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:35.196
I've got a plan that'll get
the door to the factory open!

00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:36.666
Wha? Really?

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:39.939
[INHEL] Definitely! Just keep
fighting Señor for now.

00:18:39.972 --> 00:18:42.443
We need time to pull this off!

00:18:43.345 --> 00:18:49.525
Easy peasy! You can count on me!

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:55.771
Up there! I see two people
with one-star prizes!

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:57.406
Fire!

00:18:59.278 --> 00:19:01.214
Not good. We've been seen.

00:19:01.247 --> 00:19:02.551
Hey, jackass!

00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:05.323
If you hit Miss Robin,
you're gonna be sorry.

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:07.226
Don't you worry one bit!

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:10.166
I'll put up a nice
barrier for you!

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:12.904
Barrier time!

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:16.211
[gasps] Aw crap!

00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:19.519
I can't cross my fingers
or I'll fall to the ground!

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:20.955
We got this!

00:19:20.988 --> 00:19:23.225
Cut that out! Damn it!

00:19:23.258 --> 00:19:25.029
Don't make me come down there!

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:26.566
Oh, I know!

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.402
How 'bout I cause
a "rain of terror"

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:31.041
like I did at the Coliseum?

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:33.312
[BARTOLOMEO laughs]

00:19:33.345 --> 00:19:36.586
Huh? Wait a second!
What the hell's he doing?

00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:40.960
Huh? No way. He...
He wouldn't dare, would he?

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:46.739
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
You want some of this?

00:19:46.773 --> 00:19:49.611
[BARTOLOMEO laughs]

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:53.886
Ha! Can't take the heat, huh?

00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:20.473
[BELLAMY] So, I just gotta
win the tournament?

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:23.546
Then you'll give me
a spot in the Family?

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.583
[DOFLAMINGO]
Of course.

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:29.659
I'll be cheering for you.

00:20:29.692 --> 00:20:33.867
[DELLINGER] I'm gonna finish
you off, right here, right now.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.837
Young Master says!

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:38.810
[BELLAMY]
I can't go on like this.

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:41.481
I have to settle things!

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:55.844
[TREBOL]
Hey, hey, Doffy.

00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:58.916
Did you send String-Joker
off somewhere?

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:03.960
[DOFLAMINGO] Yeah. I was
gonna deliver something,

00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:06.532
but I guess he doesn't need it.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:09.103
"Deliver something," huh?

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.410
[DOFLAMINGO] While we're
sitting here waiting,

00:21:12.443 --> 00:21:15.349
do you remember the day
when Law first showed up?

00:21:15.383 --> 00:21:17.588
All those years ago?

00:21:18.489 --> 00:21:23.533
[laughs] He was crazy!
Had a wild look in his eyes!

00:21:23.566 --> 00:21:26.705
Yeah, uh-huh! [laughs]

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:29.110
[DOFLAMINGO]
Reminded me of myself

00:21:29.144 --> 00:21:31.816
when I was that age,
to be honest.

00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:36.391
I thought "in ten years,
this hateful little monster

00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:39.363
will make a fine
right-hand-man."

00:21:42.605 --> 00:21:46.178
But now, it looks like
I'll be killing him instead.

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:47.981
Such a pity.

00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:04.614
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE J]
We have an intruder!

00:22:04.648 --> 00:22:06.586
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K] Don't
touch him! He has explosives

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:08.055
strapped to his body!

00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:10.994
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:13.567
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hey! Who the hell is this kid?

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.469
Why did you let him in?

00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:20.647
Let me join your pirate crew.

00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:21.816
Huh?

00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:25.791
I wanna destroy
everything that I see!

00:22:25.824 --> 00:22:31.301
People. Towns. I wanna burn
this whole world to the ground.

00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:34.742
You know, I'm from Flevence.

00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:37.112
I came here from the White Town.

00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:47.734
[LAW] It won't be long...
before I'm dead.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:07.439
[LUFFY yelling]
Mingo!

00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:16.926
[NARRATOR] The Executives
of the Don Quixote Family

00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:18.195
finally enter the fray,

00:23:18.228 --> 00:23:21.669
starting a full-scale battle
with Luffy and the others.

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:23.973
When it seems like
the palace is out of reach,

00:23:24.006 --> 00:23:26.879
the ragtag group of allies
that Luffy has acquired

00:23:26.912 --> 00:23:29.818
come together and
prove their worth!

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:31.789
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.822 --> 00:23:33.358
"A United Front!

00:23:33.392 --> 00:23:35.697
Luffy's Breakthrough
to the Victory!"

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.736
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
