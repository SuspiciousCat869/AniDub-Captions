1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,068
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,869
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,011
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,305
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,715
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:30,849
[NARRATOR] Last time,
Nami found herself trapped

25
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:34,185
on the Ark Maxim until her
crewmates Sanji and Usopp

26
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,730
snuck on board to save her.

27
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:38,857
In fact, I'd bet my
favorite carving knife

28
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,483
they already know we're here!

29
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:44,154
They know we're here?
So what are we supposed to do?

30
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,656
[SANJI]
Stop freakin' out, for starters.

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,491
Once we're safely
inside, we'll split up

32
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,493
and head for the main deck.

33
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:52,245
Nami's gotta be up there!

34
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,999
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Luffy
had a gold ball attached

35
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:58,835
to his arm by Eneru and
was thrown into the ruins

36
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:00,045
of Shandora.

37
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:03,131
But Luffy got back up
to settle the score.

38
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,966
[LUFFY grunts]
All right!

39
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,261
Dammit! I can't get
this golden ball off!

40
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,763
[AISA]
Hey, watch your mouth!

41
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:11,264
Of course, it's futile.

42
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,310
Why don't you be gone!

43
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,729
[NARRATOR] Ussop saved Nami
in the nick of time,

44
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:20,648
but he was unable to
withstand Eneru's great power.

45
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:24,694
It seemed Usopp was
about to meet his end.

46
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:25,945
El...!

47
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,282
Sanji, run!

48
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:30,325
Get going.

49
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,910
...Thor!

50
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,544
I was looking...

51
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:44,089
...for a light. Appreciate it.

52
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,219
[LUFFY]
"Capriccio for Despair!

53
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:52,180
The Impending Doom
of Sky Island!"

54
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,976
I'm going to cry?

55
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,311
Really.

56
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,439
[crash]

57
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,234
[ENERU]
What?

58
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:13,243
[ENERU]
My ark!

59
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,258
Get ready... to cry, bastard.

60
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,635
Damn you!

61
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,348
[ENERU]
You did something below deck!

62
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,600
What have you done to my ark?!

63
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:40,437
[explosion]

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,604
You fool!

65
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,065
You wretched fool!

66
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,569
The gears have gone awry.

67
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:49,029
I must fix them.

68
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,339
[USOPP]
Good. He's gone.

69
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,473
Don't you worry.

70
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:18,975
Nami fell safely into
some island clouds.

71
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,689
[USOPP]
So high...

72
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,692
Not the jungle. Not the ruins.

73
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,403
Focus on falling into
the island clouds.

74
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,657
[grunts]

75
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,701
Usopp...

76
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:37,911
...Hopping!

77
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:47,921
[USOPP yelling]

78
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:51,716
Oh, no! I jumped too far!
I jumped too far!

79
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,344
[yelling]

80
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:57,180
No!

81
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,057
Oh, no! We're gonna crash!

82
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,850
We're gonna crash
and then we're gonna die!

83
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,728
[USOPP yelling]

84
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:14,030
[USOPP yelling]

85
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:16,324
How could I have
forgotten to unhook it?

86
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,451
[USOPP whimpers]

87
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:21,162
Huh?

88
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:24,332
[screams]

89
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,593
[NAMI]
Usopp! Sanji!

90
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,721
[USOPP]
Nami, is that you?

91
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,389
Sounds like you
made it down, all right.

92
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,890
What a relief!

93
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:42,142
Sanji!

94
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,476
Sanji, are you okay?

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,395
Oh, you got burnt
to a crisp for us.

96
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,774
I'm so sorry! I promise I'll
make it up to you somehow!

97
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:52,152
[USOPP] I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

98
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:55,280
Nami, hurry! Hurry up and
pull me out! I can't breathe!

99
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,907
[NAMI]
Oh, sorry. All right.

100
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:00,035
Let's get the heck outta here!

101
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,620
[grunting]

102
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:06,166
Why won't you come out?

103
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,724
Curse you, blue sea dweller.

104
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,658
This vessel is not
so easily brought down.

105
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:43,995
I am fully acquainted
with the ark's drive circuits.

106
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:49,292
We may lack electricity,
but a backup system

107
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,920
harnesses the wind power
of 200 Jet Dials

108
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,756
I gathered in my
homeland of Birka.

109
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:02,055
They will keep this ship
aloft for quite some time.

110
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:05,350
No matter what
you feeble beings try...

111
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:20,490
This land and all its pathetic
inhabitants will perish.

112
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,578
[NAMI] 'Kay guys,
check out that huge vine.

113
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:28,540
If it's the same one I saw
when I was down in the ruins,

114
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,792
then it stands to reason
we're on the Island Clouds

115
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,293
right above them.

116
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,587
[USOPP] Ruins?
Oh, The City of Gold!

117
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,714
It's real?

118
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:37,215
It's real.

119
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,927
But Eneru took all the gold
that was there for himself.

120
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,179
If the ruins are beneath us,
Zoro and the others

121
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,472
should be down there.

122
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:48,101
I may not know
the lay of the land...

123
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:52,772
But I do know one thing:
staying here is dangerous.

124
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,234
You got that right.

125
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:59,154
Hop on! Let's find everyone
and get off this island.

126
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,447
That's a plan!

127
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,702
There are no safe
places left in Skypiea.

128
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,121
[LUFFY panting]

129
00:09:15,628 --> 00:09:18,381
[AISA grunting]

130
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:22,385
[LUFFY grunting]

131
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,930
[AISA yells]
Luffy! Look out!

132
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,516
[LUFFY]
Huh?

133
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,271
[LUFFY yelling]

134
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,231
[LUFFY]
So fast!

135
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,108
No, wait! Luffy!

136
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:40,236
That's the wrong way!
Go left! Left!

137
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:44,741
[LUFFY] There's no way
I can turn that sharp!

138
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,743
Gum-Gum...

139
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:47,952
...Hook!

140
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,289
[LUFFY laughs]

141
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:55,669
[LUFFY yelling]

142
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:58,088
Stop destroying my homeland!

143
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,508
Giant Jack is over that-a-way!

144
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:03,843
[LUFFY]
I know, but-- [crash]

145
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,512
[AISA]
Stop breaking things!

146
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,972
--[crash]
--Stop it!

147
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:17,148
[ENERU] Hmph. The thunderclouds
are gushing out nicely now.

148
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,906
[ENERU]
So the rats have scurried off.

149
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,078
They're shrewd, but so restless.

150
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,454
Ah, no matter.

151
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,498
The festivities
are close at hand.

152
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,379
[LUFFY]
Oh, man.

153
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:41,256
Robin and the others are gone.

154
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,049
Zoro and Chopper.

155
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,719
[AISA]
And Wyper and Gan Fall.

156
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:48,179
Well where the heck
did everybody go?

157
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:53,309
I'm guessing they
must have climbed up already.

158
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,395
Yeah, Robin must
have helped them.

159
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:56,563
Let's go.

160
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,608
Hey, Aisa.

161
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,196
[AISA whimpering]

162
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,207
[ROBIN]
I don't know.

163
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,752
Listen carefully.

164
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:23,673
If we don't do something,
Skypiea... will disappear.

165
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:27,218
What? It'll disappear?

166
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:29,763
My homeland will
be completely gone?!

167
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:33,850
Everything will fall.

168
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:37,771
He said this nation in
the sky was unnatural.

169
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,190
He said he'd send it
crashing to the ground.

170
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:41,900
Hey, Luffy?

171
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,485
What's up?

172
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:47,572
[AISA] Will the sky islands
really be destroyed?

173
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,408
[crying]

174
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,971
[LUFFY grunting]

175
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:17,060
[yelling]

176
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,318
[AISA]
Wyper and the others.

177
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,778
They're right through here!

178
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,448
[LUFFY yelling]

179
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,622
[ROBIN] I suspect the ship is
moving towards the Grand Belfry.

180
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,208
Wonder what happened to
Miss Navigator and the boys.

181
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:43,169
If they're on that ship,
it could mean they're...

182
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,134
[LUFFY]
We're through!

183
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,431
[AISA yelling]

184
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:55,849
[AISA]
Luffy, down there!

185
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:58,143
Stop! Stop!

186
00:12:58,226 --> 00:12:59,436
[LUFFY]
Robin!

187
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,354
[AISA]
What're you doing?

188
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,231
[LUFFY]
Look after these two for me!

189
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,108
[AISA screams]

190
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:07,736
[LUFFY grunts]

191
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:12,115
[AISA screams]

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,827
[LUFFY]
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

193
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,911
Stop!

194
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:19,914
Luffy!

195
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:21,082
[AISA screams]

196
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,335
You grew extra hands!

197
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,670
[ROBIN]
What have you got on your arm?

198
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,047
[LUFFY]
Robin!

199
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,008
The golden bell is at the
top of this vine, right?

200
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:33,219
And Eneru is trying to get
his hands on it, isn't he?

201
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,763
That's right.

202
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:38,767
If the Grand Belfry exists,
then the bell would be there.

203
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,768
But he's already--

204
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:40,769
[LUFFY]
Good.

205
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,437
[AISA yelling]

206
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,521
[ROBIN]
Luffy!

207
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,608
Gone, just like that.

208
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,943
So, young lady.

209
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,031
Have you seen our navigator?

210
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,449
A woman with orange hair?

211
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,618
You mean Nami?
She's on the ship.

212
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,163
[AISA]
Huh...

213
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,582
I only hear one voice
coming from the sky.

214
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:09,130
[NAMI]
There they are!

215
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:15,303
[USOPP]
Whoa! Robin!

216
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,180
Miss Navigator. With Long Nose.

217
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,264
And the Cook too.

218
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:20,308
[AISA laughing]

219
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,352
[NAMI]
Aisa!

220
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:24,437
Thank goodness! You all right?

221
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,522
Nami!

222
00:14:26,523 --> 00:14:27,399
[USOPP]
Huh?

223
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,442
Zoro! Chopper!

224
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,194
Weird Old Guy!

225
00:14:31,277 --> 00:14:33,071
And a guerilla!

226
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:36,616
Oh, oh, oh!
Everyone's been taken down!

227
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,035
Oh! If only I had been here!

228
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,495
[NAMI]
Wait, Aisa, where's Luffy?

229
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:41,955
Wasn't he with you?

230
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:45,041
Luffy climbed up
the vine to rescue you.

231
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,419
But since everyone's here,
Luffy has to face Eneru

232
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,587
by himself!

233
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,423
We missed him, didn't we?

234
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:52,632
Just now.

235
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,051
I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't listen.

236
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,928
Dammit, Luffy.

237
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,888
He knows we're
running short on time.

238
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,224
We gotta go now!

239
00:15:01,307 --> 00:15:05,103
Go on without me. I'll take
the waver and find him.

240
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:07,188
Just try to get to
the Merry somehow!

241
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,903
[LUFFY]
Ah, man!

242
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,990
That ship is movin' fast!

243
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:20,285
Eneru!

244
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:24,164
[SHANDORIAN B]
Quickly! Get on the ships!

245
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,249
The whole sky is turning black!

246
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:32,339
[CROWD yelling]

247
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:38,887
[CHIEFTAIN]
What's wrong?

248
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,847
We need to flee at once.

249
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,224
My daughter Aisa.
She still hasn't...

250
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,269
Ah. She still hasn't returned.

251
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,563
Aisa is a bright child.

252
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,899
We must have faith that
she is with some warriors

253
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,734
and will be protected.

254
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:53,818
Right.

255
00:15:54,486 --> 00:16:00,784
[CROWD yelling]

256
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,078
[WHITE BERET A]
Hurry! Hurry up!

257
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,372
[WHITE BERET B] Captain! If we
don't use the boats at the dock,

258
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,290
we'll never fit everyone in!

259
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,417
They'd have to sail
all the way around!

260
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,835
You men!

261
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,254
Use dials to create rivers
inside the island at once!

262
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,464
[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

263
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:21,012
Everyone!

264
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,014
You have to go to Cloud End
at the edge of the clouds

265
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,808
right away before it's too late!

266
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:28,186
Eneru is planning to destroy
this land and everyone on it!

267
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,939
If we don't evacuate now,
we're going to die!

268
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,113
[CONIS]
If we know anything about Eneru,

269
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,447
we know this.

270
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,616
He's always had the power
to bring us to despair,

271
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,244
to make us suffer and break us!
I tell you!

272
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:47,497
What happens now makes our
past suffering insignificant!

273
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,916
It's not going to do any
good sitting and waiting

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,918
for a miracle!

275
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,212
It's time to face the fact
that as far as this land

276
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:56,506
is concerned,
God has abandoned us!

277
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,842
Before we pray,
before we close our eyes

278
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,218
to what's really happening here,

279
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,929
we have to do what we can
to save ourselves!

280
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:06,349
We can't survive by hiding
behind his victims any longer!

281
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:07,684
If we do nothing...

282
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,394
No matter who we try to blame,

283
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:13,481
we're all going to lose our
lives, and it'll be our fault!

284
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,067
If we want to live,
we must leave!

285
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,364
[MCKINLEY] How many of
the islanders are left?

286
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:23,241
[WHITE BERET B]
Almost half of them!

287
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,577
People only, no more baggage!

288
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,580
And get everybody
out to sea right away!

289
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,873
[WHITE BERET B]
Yes, sir!

290
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,758
Hold it!

291
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:42,218
Nobody's leaving until
everyone pays the 2 billion

292
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,387
Extol departure fee!

293
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,513
Amazon, hurry!

294
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,599
You can still escape with us!

295
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:48,475
[AMAZON]
Huh?

296
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:50,310
[MAN A]
Hurry to Cloud End!

297
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:51,227
[AMAZON]
Huh?

298
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,979
[MAN A]
The sky islands...

299
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:55,607
...are about to be destroyed!

300
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,778
Oh, my.

301
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,545
The wind has stopped.

302
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:47,659
[thunder rumbling]

303
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,512
[CROWD yelling]

304
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,431
[MAN B]
Run! Run!

305
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,516
[USOPP]
Wha--?

306
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:21,568
[ENERU]
Now, then.

307
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,530
Let us begin the festivities.

308
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,617
The time for endings has come.

309
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,877
Mamaragan.

310
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,348
[MAN B]
Get away from the island!

311
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:54,059
[MAN C]
Run! Don't look back!

312
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,310
[yelling]

313
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:56,936
[MAN D] The lightning
keeps getting bigger!

314
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,230
[MAN E] The boats at the
docks have been destroyed!

315
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:01,107
[WHITE BERET B]
To the western end of the beach!

316
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:03,568
Quickly!
There are still boats there!

317
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:04,861
Run to the west!

318
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:06,196
[MCKINLEY]
Move, people!

319
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,864
Leave your belongings!

320
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:18,500
[SHANDORIAN A]
Chief!

321
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,876
We need to get you on a boat!

322
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:24,506
[CHIEFTAIN]
Great warrior Kalgara.

323
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,842
I beg you.

324
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,344
Protect us all.

[NAMI, USOPP scream]

326
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,825
Man, those lightning
bolts are huge!

327
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:55,370
We're gonna end up
sky dust if we stay here!

[engine revving]

329
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,749
[NAMI]
Guys! Go now!

330
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,335
Once I find Luffy,
we'll be right behind you!

331
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,295
Uh, yeah, right! I gotcha!

332
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,012
[USOPP]
Hurry, Robin!

333
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:15,056
We gotta find a way to
carry these guys to the ship!

334
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,266

Weird Old Guy!

00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,488
Oh, good, you're awake now!

340
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:31,823
There's not a moment to lose!

341
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,825
D'you think you can walk yet?

342
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,745
[GAN FALL]
So... Eneru has begun.

343
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,502
We must all hurry now.

344
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:47,047
There is truly nothing
more we can do here.

345
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,094
Wyper.

346
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:58,767
[NAMI]
We have to get out of here!

347
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,728
Not even Luffy can handle
an enemy who can fly!

348
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,731
I have to get to him before
this island is obliterated!

You better not think for
a second that I'm gonna

353
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,208
let you get away
with this, Eneru!

<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

355
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:36,805
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

356
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,557
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

357
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:44,354
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

358
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:52,821
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

359
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,825
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

360
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

361
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:11,006
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

362
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,427
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

363
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,220
<i>they come to you</i>

364
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:22,684
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

365
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:28,565
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

366
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:35,280
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

367
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:44,289
[NARRATOR] Some 400 years
ago, there lived a man

368
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:47,375
known far and wide as a liar.

369
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,961
No one believed
his outrageous tales

370
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:53,465
and he was executed for his
apparent lies and trickery.

371
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:57,385
But the truth lives on
in the clouds high above!

372
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,137
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

373
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,097
"Led by a Bell's Sound!

374
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:04,059
Tale of the Great Warrior
and the Explorer!"

375
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,686
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
