00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,787
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,355
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,091
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,559
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,129
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,434

7
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>Have the courage, set sail
and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:47,081
<i>A glimpse of the sun
rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:51,485
<i>Back when we first started,
we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,655
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,724
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:00:56,757 --> 00:01:01,795
<i>For together we found we look
through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:07,201
<i>And we know, that our
hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,138
<i>Where the compass
points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,074
<i>There's no looking back,
take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,043
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:21,348
<i>We cast off all our troubles,
forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,250
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:28,222
<i>We still can smile
we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,063
<i>Every tear that we've cried only
helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>You and those dreams
are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:50,710
<i>A glimpse of the sun
rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,217
It was somewhere around here.

25
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,420
[NAMI]
Found it!

26
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,522
Good. If things are
going as planned,

27
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,490
Luffy and the others
have recovered the gold

28
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,225
and are heading back
to the ship right now.

29
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,727
Yeah, and we need
to do the same.

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,462
I wonder how we're going
to sneak this thing

31
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,464
back across the bay
to the Merry?

32
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,565
Wait! Where's my head?

33
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,168
The waver works just
as well on the Blue Sea, too!

34
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,569
Come on, let's move!

35
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,506
Now grab on, Sanji,
and hold on tight!

36
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,307
Onto you?

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,477
I've been truly blessed!
Thank you!

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,780
Ah. You've smiled upon me,
fate. Hallelujah!

39
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,250
[NAMI] Yeah, yeah.
Whatever. Just get on already!

40
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:31,418
With pleasure, Nami! [laughs]

41
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,453
Moron!

42
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,555
I didn't mean it like that! Guh!

43
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:38,759
[SANJI]
Nami, that love tap was dynamic!

44
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,395
It knocked me off my feet!

45
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,230
Hang on tight, Romeo!

46
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,066

[USOPP whimpers]

50
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,815
[ZORO] Looks like they
pulled one over on us, guys.

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,484
Ya have to hand it to them.

52
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,387
I wish I could eat a fish
that big right now.

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,622
How can you think about
food at a time like this?

54
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,058
We almost got killed
opening this thing up!

55
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,060
[OFFICER B] Commander Jonathan
knew you'd show up here

56
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,562
once he realized
you'd stolen the map.

57
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,797
Perceptive.

58
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,699
There's nowhere to run. Give up!

59
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,702
[USOPP] Even with Luffy and
Zoro, we don't stand a chance.

60
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,203
So, do we just wait here

61
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,406
for Nami and Sanji
to come save our bacon?

62
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,507
[ROBIN]
No.

63
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,209
I'm sure that the whole base
knows where we are now.

64
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,811
Reinforcements are
no doubt on their way

65
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,480
and it's only a matter
of time until they arrive.

66
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,049
We need to get out of here.

67
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,417
Yeah! If our gold's not here,

68
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,786
then we just need to go
look for it someplace else!

69
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,055
That's easier said than done!

70
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,690
In case you haven't noticed

71
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,292
those doors are the only way
outta here, and we gotta fight

72
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,361
our way through those
guys to get to 'em!

73
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,629
So, what's the problem?

74
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,830
Come on, you guys!

75
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,599
We're getting out of here!

76
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,101
Not if the men of Navarone
have anything to say about it!

77

This isn't good!
I think we're done for!

What the...?

81
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,852
Condoriano?

82
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:14,622
You came to the vault,
just as I predicted you would.

83
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,357
And just who the hell are you?

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,592
And who gave you permission
to open those doors?

85
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,593
[SHEPHERD]
Who am I?

86
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,396
I'm a Special Inspector from HQ!

The name's Major Shepherd!

00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,101
Your commander gave
me and my mobile unit

89

permission to open those doors!

90
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,170
We'll take it from here.

91
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,373
You and your men
aren't needed anymore!

Oh! You were the guy locked up
in jail with Usopp and Zoro!

You're looking well.

I can't tell you how much I've
been looking forward to this.

101

Thanks to you,
I've dealt with humiliation,

103
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,400
and being called Condoriano!

104

You'll rue the day
you crossed me!

105
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,571
You're all going to pay!

[OFFICER B]
Major Shepherd!

107
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,174
What? Can't you see
I'm talking here?

108
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,776
You're gonna need some more men.

109
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,711
Trust me, I say this
from experience.

110

underestimate them, Major.

circles around them!

take down the Straw Hats!

a court-martial, stand down!

namesake, I assure you!

as a warship's main cannon!

This can only mean
that those Marines

think we're still inside

[LUFFY] Yeah! That kitchen
where me and Sanji were at!

176
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,229
[ZORO] The one where all
the Marines eat? Get real!

177
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,365
[USOPP]
Yeah! We'd be crazy to go there!

178
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,400
Then again, the enemy might
think the same thing

179
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,168
and not bother to
look for us there.

180
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,772
Right! It's decided.
We're getting some food.

181
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,440
[USOPP, ZORO]
No, we're not!

182
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,409
[CHOPPER]
There's nothing to worry about!

183
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,311
I'm a full-fledged pirate!

184
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,179
And pirates don't get scared,

185
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,582
even when they're left in
a spooky, abandoned dock

186
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:02,449
all by themselves.

187
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,418
--[engine rumbles]
--[NAMI] Chopper!

188
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,787
[CHOPPER]
Nami! Sanji! Thank goodness!

189
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,191
Um, I mean, I didn't get scared
guarding the ship all by myself!

190
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,760
Luffy and the others
aren't back?

191
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,562
[CHOPPER] No!
I've been alone all this time!

192
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,197
I wonder where they are?

193
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,466
Something must have
happened to 'em.

194
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,268
And the gold, too?

195
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,137
I'm gonna go look! 'Kay?

196
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,506
Date with Nami part two!

197
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,207
[CHOPPER]
Alone again...

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,043
[NAMI]
Sanji, stay here.

199
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,477
I need you on the ship.

200
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,379
[engine rumbles]

201
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,649
[NAMI] As I recall, that vault
was somewhere down this slope.

202
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,519
[NAMI]
Huh?

203
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,590
[NAMI]
Oh, no.

204
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,358
The Straw Hats fled
into the mountains!

205
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,726
I want these hills scoured!

206
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,194
Pick up the pace, men!
Double-time it!

207
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,698
[MEMBER A]
Are you all right, sir?

208
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,200
Darn it, I almost
had those pirates!

209
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,602
Stupid instruction manual.

210
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,304
Still, finding an empty vault
doesn't necessarily mean

211
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,640
they've given up!
In fact, I'm sure they won't!

212
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,077
And that means we still
have a decent chance! Heh.

213
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,578
[NAMI gasps]
Empty?

214
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,181
I knew it was possible they
might spring the first trap,

215
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,149
but I've already
got another one set.

216
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,819
I always have
a back-up plan! [laughs]

217
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,221
[NAMI]
Wait! The vault was a trap?

218
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,424
If the gold wasn't in there,
where could it be?

219
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,211
[LUFFY] Hmm. Coulda sworn
it was around here somewhere.

220
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,114
[USOPP] Wait. You mean
this isn't the right place?

221
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,649
I dunno. I can't tell.

222
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,585
You can't? But weren't you and
Sanji here just a few hours ago?

223
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,488
According to this map,
we're in the medical ward.

224
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,557
Shh! I think hear
someone up ahead!

225
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,593
[USOPP hums]

226
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,296
[KOBATO] Dad, please listen
to me! You have to take it!

227
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,065
[MECHAO] I don't care if you are
my daughter! That stuff's nasty!

228
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,134
[KOBATO]
It's medicine, Dad!

229
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,101
Those voices...

230
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:04,104
It's that doctor
who acted as our hostage.

231
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,639
And the old man!

232
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,543
So, the gold wasn't
on your ship?

233
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,677
[ROBIN]
Or in the vault.

234
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,547
[USOPP] It's wild that you two
are father and daughter.

235
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,584
Say, are you sick or
something, old man?

236
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,519
Let's just say there's
nothin' wrong with me

237
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:20,588
that a nip from
the bottle won't cure!

238
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,757
The stuff in this bottle's
all the medicine I need!

239
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,991
Ugh! Dad!

240
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,727
You know there's no smoking
or drinking in the medical ward!

241
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,596
[MECHAO]
Come on! Just one drink!

242
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,730
--[KOBATO] No!
--Why do you have

243
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,964
to be so stubborn?

244
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,801
Come on, old man. You really
need to listen to your daughter.

245
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,236
I-I mean your doctor.

246
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,337
[MECHAO]
You're lecturing me?

247
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,272
The same guys
whose hides I saved,

248
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,242
but instead of escaping, they
come waltzing right back here?

249
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,476
Oh, that's rich!

250
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,512
Is that dad-blasted gold really
that important to you guys?

251
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,615
Of course it is, old repair guy!

252
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,717
We are pirates after all!

253
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,918
[KOBATO]
Think about it, Dad.

254
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,820
Would you walk away from that
much gold if it was yours?

255
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,489
I'm sure they must have
worked really hard for it.

256
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,524
You just stay out
of this, Kobato!

257
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,126
We were saving that gold.

258
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,327
Saving?

259
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,663
[USOPP] Yeah. We were gonna
use it to hire a shipwright

260
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,065
to make major repairs
to The Going Merry,

261
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,166
like you said we should.

262
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,636
[MECHAO] Hah! Like I'd believe
a bunch of pirates!

263
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,204
Fine! You don't
have to believe us!

264
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,805
But we are going
to fix the Merry up!

265
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,674
I don't care what
you believe, you old coot!

266
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,209
Coot?!

267
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,677
[KOBATO]
Dad, I believe him.

268
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,578
[MECHAO, USOPP]
Huh?

269
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,613
It isn't just their ship.

270
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,415
[inaudible]

271
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,516
[KOBATO]
It's also their home.

272
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,187
Home? Yeah.

273
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,223
Well, there it is!

274
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,724
It's not the quickest
way to get around,

275
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,726
but there usually aren't
any guards up that way.

276
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,763
That path'll take you
right up into the mountains.

277
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,565
It looks more like a sheer cliff
than it does a path!

278
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,301
[LUFFY]
All right then!

279
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:43,404
Let's go get our gold!
Thanks, old repair guy!

280
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,271
Good luck!

281
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,140
Well, off we go.

282
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,441
Thanks again for the help!

283
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,742
See ya!

284
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,610
Hold up!

285
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:50,577
Uh, huh?

286
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:53,347
Our commander's hobby
is fishin', ya see.

287
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,115
Yeah. That figures.

288
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,450
Who else would have
a big fish painting

289
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,152
like the one we
saw in the vault?

290
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,453
He's found the perfect bait

291
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,122
to reel you guys
in with: your gold!

292
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,491
Like a good fisherman,
he's probably got it dangling

293
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,360
where you can see it
in plain sight.

294
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,263
[USOPP]
In plain sight... Think so, huh?

295
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,464
[LUFFY]
You coming?!

296
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,332
Uh, yeah!

297
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,833
Now! Get outta here! Go!

298
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,735
'Kay! See ya!

299
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,570
Hey, wait up, guys!

300
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,273
[MECHAO] Even if they somehow
manage to get their gold back

301
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,609
and escape,
Navarone'll be in trouble.

302
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:25,145
Yep, I bet the brass'll
finally shut us down.

303
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,314
I must be crazy.

304
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,515
[ROBIN]
Too bad we didn't have time

305
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,417
to come up with
a plan back there.

306
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,520
[USOPP] So, what are
we supposed to do now?

307
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:37,224
Just wander around aimlessly
until we find the gold?

308
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,092
[grunts]

309
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,660
Hey, what is it?

310
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,763
Quiet. I thought
I heard something.

311
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,133
Then again, maybe not.

312
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,735
[ROBIN]
No. I hear it, too.

313
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,569
[rumbling]

314
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,171
[USOPP panting]
Something's coming!

315
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,172
[USOPP]
Uh...

316
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,241
[USOPP]
The waver!

317
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,009
And Nami! Uh...

318
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,414
[NAMI] I see. And then
you ran into Dr. Kobato.

319
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,750
Mm. Unfortunately,
we still don't have any clue

320
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,285
about where the gold is.

321
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,287
[yawns]

322
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,188
I'm gettin' sleepy.

323
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,123
Dawn's gonna be here
before we know it

324
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:13,060
and it'll be a lot harder
to sneak around. We need a plan.

325
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,229
Are there any other
storage vaults here?

326
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,363
Even if there are more,

327
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,766
they could just be bait
to lead us into another trap.

328
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,171
Hey, wait, that reminds me of
something the old man told me.

329
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,806
He said something about "bait."

330
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,608
[NAMI] Huh? What do
ya mean "something?"

331
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:32,279
"Hiding bait in plain sight,"
I think that was it. Hmm.

332
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,381
[NAMI]
Usopp, that's it!

333
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,348
Huh? What's it?

334
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,451
[NAMI] Well, the bait's
obviously the gold.

335
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,387
If it isn't locked away, then
it's somewhere we can see it.

336
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,722
[LUFFY yawns]

337
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,090
"In plain sight."

338
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,658
[NAMI] And what if
"in plain sight" meant

339
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,760
"in plain sight" of
a crafty fisherman?

340
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,429
[ROBIN]
Oh! Nice thinking!

341
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,530
[ZORO]
What do ya mean?

342
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,631
[ROBIN]
It's simple.

343
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,300
Really, who's the person
dangling our gold as bait

344
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,168
to catch us right now?

345
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,105
You mean the commander
of this place?

346
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,242
[NAMI] Right!
The commander is the fisherman!

347
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,744
And if the bait really is in
plain sight of the fisherman,

348
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,512
then that means
there's only one place

349
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,281
where our gold could be kept.

350
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,582
You don't mean--

351
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,417
[NAMI]
Yep! That's right!

352
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,352
[thud]

353
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,453
Hey, what gives?

354
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:13,621
You did say that you knew

355
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,723
where the commander's
office was, right?

356
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:16,790
So, take me there!

357
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,491
Uh, okay.

358
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,328
[NAMI]
All right, Luffy and I will go.

359
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,631
Robin, you and the others
get back to the old dock.

360
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,666
Chopper and Sanji
will be waiting for you.

361
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,700
[ROBIN]
Want any back-up?

362
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,469
[NAMI] No. The waver
can only hold two people.

363
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,174
We're gonna get spotted anyway,

364
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,276
so stealth isn't
an issue anymore.

365
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,780
[NAMI] I'm gonna run
this baby at full throttle!

366
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,148
You ready, Luffy?

367
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,250
Yeah! Anytime you are!

368
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,386
[NAMI grunts]
Then hold on!

369
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,589
[MARINE F]
Huh? The pirates!

370
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,593
[NAMI]
Where is it?

371
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,561
[LUFFY]
It's, uh...

372
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,533
Hurry up and find it!

373
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,468
U-Up there!

374
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,069
[NAMI]
Where exactly?!

375
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,372
[MARINE G]
Stop 'em!

376
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,074
[LUFFY]
That's it!

377
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,675
Hold on!

378
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,013
[gasps]

379
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,618
[JONATHAN] I've got to
hand it to you, Straw Hat!

380
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,520
You really know how
to make an entrance! Bravo!

381
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,757
That guy, he's the commander?

382
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,327
Yep! That's the old
fortress guy!

383
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,429
[JONATHAN] That contraption
of yours is incredible!

384
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,431
Just where in the
world did you get it?

385
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,833
[LUFFY] It's called a waver,
and it's not from this world!

386
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:33,967
It's from the sky

387
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,737
and Nami's the only person
who knows how to drive it!

388
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,072
Don't tell him!

389
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,640
Oh, right. Sorry.

390
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:40,641
[JONATHAN]
You're one of the few members

391
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:43,344
of the crew I haven't met,
Miss, so, welcome.

392
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,412
You Straw Hats have
really impressed me.

393
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,249
You're brave, perceptive, and
bold, which I greatly admire,

394
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,551
but you're pirates
and outlaws nonetheless.

395
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,785
What a shame.

396
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:54,654
I'm sorry we couldn't have met
under happier circumstances.

397
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,625
I'm afraid there won't
be any hungry soldiers

398
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,459
coming to save you
this time, Luffy.

399
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:01,662
Hang on a minute!

400
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,598
Shouldn't a fisherman let
his prey see the bait at least?

401
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,466
[JONATHAN]
Hm?

402
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:06,634
[NAMI]
Where's the gold?

403
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,603
Can't we see it one last time
before you haul us away?

404
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,338
It's somewhere
in this room, right?

405
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,173
[JONATHAN]
Yes, it's right there.

406
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,242
It's out in plain sight?!

407
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,212
Whoa! There it is! Our gold!

408
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,247
Nami, we finally found it!

409
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,283
Hey! It's not fake, is it?

410
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,418
Oh, no.
It's the genuine article.

411
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,153
You can check for
yourself if you'd like.

412
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:27,321
I will! Thank you!

413
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,656
Wait!

414
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:29,824
[LUFFY]
It's real!

415
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:33,159
This is our gold, all right!
There's no doubt about it!

416
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,829
I guess we can be going now!

417
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,565
Hey, sorry about the doors,
old fortress guy!

418
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,301
I'm sorry, Straw Hat.

419
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,003
I can't let you just
take the bait and run.

420
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,308
[JONATHAN]
Arrest them, and please

421
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,343
try not to harm the young lady.

422
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,744
Oh, thank you.

423
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,446
[JONATHAN]
Take Straw Hat first.

424
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:56,249
Okay, fine! Wanna fight?
I'll kick all your butts!

425
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,620
Not another one
of those stupid nets.

426
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,488
The ones that make me weak...

427
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,556
Sea Prism Stone!

428
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,158
[MARINE H]
We got 'em, sir!

429
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,126
Excellent work, men.

430
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,261
Now then...

431
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,330
[NAMI]
Not good! What do I do?

432
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,798
Come on, think!
Wait, that might work.

433
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,734
--[clink]
--[JONATHAN] Hmm?

434
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,537
Rain Tempo Sprinkler!

435
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,538
[MARINES grunting]

436
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,306
[NAMI]
Cool Ball!

437
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,474
Uh... It's cold.

438
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,676
[NAMI]
Heat Ball!

439
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,078
It's warm.

440
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,112
I did it!

441
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,247
[MARINE I]
What the--?

442
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,248
[MARINE J]
A cloud?

443
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,583
[NAMI] Today's forecast
calls for clear skies

444
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,452
and a zero percent
chance of rain,

445
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,322
but cumulonimbus clouds may
suddenly develop in some areas!

446
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,790
Watch out for lightning strikes!

447
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:41,161
I've had quite enough
of your parlor tricks, Miss.

448
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,697
Thunderbolt Tempo!

449
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,299
[lightning cracks]

450
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:48,635
[MARINES screaming]

451
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,472
Luffy!

452
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,073
[JONATHAN groans]

453
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,576
[NAMI]
Luffy!

454
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,244
[LUFFY groans]

455
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,346
[NAMI]
Snap out of it!

456
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,781
Hey, thanks, Nami.

457
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:03,516
Get the gold and get on! Hurry!

458
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,356
[JONATHAN] Even if the bait
gets stolen from the hook,

459
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,125
there's more than
one way to catch a fish.

460
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:18,365
[JONATHAN] All a fisherman
needs to do is be patient.

461
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,535
Luffy! Do you see the Merry
out there anywhere?

462
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:24,638
It's so dark.
I can't see anything!

463
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:30,277
Nami, be careful!
They're gonna spot us!

464
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,314
[NAMI laughs] You know, it
sorta does look like a warship!

465
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,551
Hmm, hm. It's them!

466
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:42,156
Hey! Luffy! Nami! Over here!

467
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:46,192
[SANJI] Nami! You're back!
Are you all right?

468
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,263
[SHEPHERD] So, somehow
you allow the Straw Hats

469
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,398
to escape from
your very own office,

470
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,201
and with their gold, too.
What a setback.

471
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,503
I'd hate for that to be
on my record. [chuckles]

472
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,606
[JONATHAN] Hmph. The Straw Hats
haven't escaped yet,

473
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,808
nor will they
on my watch, Major.

474
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,543
I assure you.

475
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,746
After losing them
umpteen times already?

476
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,414
Heh, don't make me laugh!

477
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,049
Since you can't
catch them yourself,

478
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:12,152
why don't you sit back
and let me? What do you say?

479
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,822
Are there any bazookas
involved this time?

480
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:17,791
What happened earlier
was just a minor complication!

481
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,628
My special pirate subjugation
squad wasn't with me

482
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,696
because they were
setting another trap!

483
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,365
Really! In that case,

484
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:27,067
I think I will sit back
and watch your men in action.

485
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,335
[SHEPHERD]
Shepherd to Pinepeak!

486
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,639
You should almost be in position
at the Sea Gate, so listen up!

487
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,607
Those pirates should
be arriving shortly!

488
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,176
The minute you see them,
blow them out of the water!

489
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,278
Got it?

490
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,612
Aye-aye, major sir!

491
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,582
Captain! We're about
to reach the ambush point, sir!

492
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,385
Good! We can't let the
pirate ship slip past us!

493
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,187
All cannons are to
open fire once it's spotted!

494
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,224
Catching them will be as easy
as shooting fish in a barrel.

495
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:53,527
A fisherman like you should
appreciate that analogy.

496
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,494
Place a pole in--

497
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,230
Could you please not
touch that pole, Major?

498
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,197
[SHEPHERD]
Ow!

499
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:00,634
I would like to ask you
something about your plan.

500
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:04,271
Sure, I'd be more than
happy to answer any questions

501
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,673
about how to catch pirates.

502
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:08,442
This special pirate
subjugation squad of yours

503
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,744
was on the Pinepeak,
is that correct?

504
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,314
Who's that on the
other ship following 'em?

505
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:16,383
[SHEPHERD]
Other ship? What are you--? Ugh!

506
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,553
That vessel isn't one
of Navarone's warships.

507
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,322
In fact, the more I look at it,

508
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,824
I don't think it's
a warship at all.

509
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,792
Then... what is it?

510
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,698
[MARINE L] Captain! A warship
is closing in on us, sir!

511
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,067
Well, it appears
to be a warship.

512
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,303
A Navarone warship? And what
do you mean by "looks like one"?

513
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,772
Well, I'm not quite sure
how to explain it.

514
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,507
[MARINE M]
It's gonna smash into us!

515
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,676
[MARINE N]
Stop! Look out!

516
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:49,250
Full speed ahead, Merry! Yeah!

517
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,518
Wh-What the--?

518
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,054
Thank you for showing us
where the currents are!

519
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,523
We couldn't have made it
this far without you!

520
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,192
We owe ya one!

521
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,026
Thanks, you guys!

522
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,597
Quick! We can't let them escape!

523
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,366
We've got bigger problems!

524
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,633
[CAPTAIN]
Huh?

525
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,670
[SHEPHERD]
No!

526
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:13,173
I can't believe they used the
Pinepeak to help their escape!

527
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,242
Curse those Straw Hats!

528
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,344
Don't worry,
they haven't escaped yet.

529
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,814
In fact, they're about to
get caught in a very big net.

530
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,182
A net?

531
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,517
Every day at 9AM,

532
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,120
the waters of Navarone
bare their fangs.

533
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,122
It's a trap that
Mother Nature provides,

534
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,191
one in which
escape is impossible.

535
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:39,133
[LUFFY]
Woo-hoo, we're finally free!

536
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,035
And we finally got our gold!

537
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,503
Yay, we did it!

538
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:45,739
Yeah! Let's get to
the Sea Gate and get out!

539
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,275
--Sure thing!
-- [SANJI] Yeah!

540
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:11,398
<i>A future lies
before us waiting
to begin</i>

541
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:14,535
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

542
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:18,672
<i>and search the world for answers</i>

543
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:23,210
<i>to all the questions
in our minds</i>

544
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:27,548
<i>Exploring day and night we'll...</i>

545
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:32,586
<i>...live out our
dreams in paradise!</i>

546
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,289
<i>And that's why...</i>

547
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:38,392
<i>We're running,
and running,</i>

548
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,362
<i>traveling along
an open road</i>

549
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,598
<i>Never letting go of
what we came to do</i>

550
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,201
<i>We're here to see this through!</i>

551
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:50,204
<i>We can't lose, can't lose,</i>

552
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:53,173
<i>nothing on earth
can stop us now</i>

553
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:56,510
<i>'Cause we're not afraid
of our own destiny</i>

554
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:02,415
<i>We Dream and live
our lives free!</i>

555
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,230
[JONATHAN] Attention,
Straw Hat Luffy and his crew!

556
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,598
This is Commander Jonathan!

557
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,400
You've fought valiantly
against some of the

558
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,135
toughest Marines in the service,

559
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,537
not to mention one of the
toughest fortresses!

560
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,073
You've done admirably,
but this is the end!

561
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,375
It's time to give it up
and surrender, Straw Hats!

562
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,643
[USOPP]
We still have a chance!

563
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,478
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

564
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,681
"Farewell, Marine Fortress!
The Last Battle for Escape!"

565
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,151
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
