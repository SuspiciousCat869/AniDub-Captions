00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.705
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:59.024
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.844
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:17.227
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.031
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:21.369
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.403 --> 00:03:23.908
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:27.013
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.053
[NARRATOR] Luffy had intended
to win a tournament that

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:32.258
promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.632
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:39.138
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:41.409
[LUFFY] We're gonna head
straight for the palace!

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:45.718
And then... we'll beat
the hell outta Doflamingo!

00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:49.592
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, at the coliseum,

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:52.698
the final battle of the
tournament is underway.

00:03:54.168 --> 00:03:56.038
Shockwave, comin' up!

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.702
Eat this. Dragon Claw!

00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:11.870
[yells]

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:18.518
[NARRATOR] And underground,
at the hidden trade port,

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:23.059
Operation S.O.P. is set
into motion by the Tontattas.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:29.640
[LEO] With this fake grape
made out of Tatababasco,

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:31.643
I'm gonna knock her out!

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:38.123
[LEO] He might be able to
shoot a fly midair, but not me!

00:04:38.156 --> 00:04:39.826
I'm faster!

00:04:43.735 --> 00:04:46.005
[LEO gasps]
Huh?

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:54.690
Yeah! You showed 'em, Commander!

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:57.929
Now that we control the lift,
we can start the next phase!

00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:00.501
[LAO G] I see you have
some fighting spirit.

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:08.650
[grunts]

00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.943
[LUFFY]
Go! Run for it!

00:05:23.748 --> 00:05:26.118
Man, he doesn't give up!

00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:29.157
[VIOLET gasps]
We're trapped!

00:05:37.808 --> 00:05:41.382
Luffy, take Violet
and go on ahead.

00:05:43.052 --> 00:05:45.958
Leave this stone bastard to me.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:49.732
You go kick Doflamingo's ass
extra hard for me, okay?

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:54.342
[LUFFY]
"Defeat Sugar!

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:57.347
The Army of the
Little People Charges!"

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:03.360
This big, stupid rock
is gettin' cut.

00:06:03.393 --> 00:06:05.363
Great! Counting on you!

00:06:08.637 --> 00:06:10.608
You're facing me now!

00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:19.760
[LUFFY]
It's trying to block us!

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:20.795
Just hurry!

00:06:20.828 --> 00:06:22.130
[LUFFY gasps]

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.769
[ZORO] Hey, I already told you
you're fighting me!

00:06:27.842 --> 00:06:29.780
Three-Sword Style!

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:32.183
Oni... Giri!

00:06:33.486 --> 00:06:34.690
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:39.031
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Stamp!

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.701
--This way!
--[VIOLET] Okay!

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.455
[ZORO]
Black Rope Tatsumaki!

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:26.993
So you finally had enough?

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.213
One-Sword Style.

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:13.653
Sword Draw.

00:08:16.861 --> 00:08:18.997
[ZORO]
Lion Song!

00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:56.338
[LAO G grunting]

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.748
[RAMPO]
Commander!

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:04.155
Ha, ha, ha! I'm amazed that
you would have the gall

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:05.558
to break in our base!

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:08.930
And that is gall
with a capital G!

00:09:12.171 --> 00:09:14.441
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:18.115
I swear. I will stop Doflamingo!

00:09:19.586 --> 00:09:23.092
[LAO G]
Ooh...

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:32.110
[LAO G yells]

00:09:37.287 --> 00:09:39.257
Commander, no!

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.972
[panting]

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:47.407
Get up!

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.877
[RAMPO]
This is looking grim.

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:52.317
If we lose him, we won't be able
to defeat Doflamingo on our own.

00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:55.591
Nor will we be able to free
our people from the factory!

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:01.670
[SMILE OVERSEER A] Isn't it
kinda weird that we haven't had

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:04.074
any new workers
in nearly a year?

00:10:09.117 --> 00:10:10.821
[SMILE OVERSEER B]
Yeah. I heard they don't even

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:13.159
visit the palace anymore.

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.265
[SMILE OVERSEER C]
Who's slackin' on the clock?

00:10:16.298 --> 00:10:17.602
--[thud]
--[DWARF A groans]

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.237
[DWARF A]
N-Not us!

00:10:27.622 --> 00:10:29.559
[SMILE OVERSEER B] You would
think when 500 of you people

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:32.998
don't return home, you'd start
to worry something's up.

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:38.176
[SMILE OVERSEER B] And yet the
Tontattas don't suspect a thing.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:43.753
They are so incredibly dumb.
I mean, pure-hearted. [chuckles]

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.161
[SMILE OVERSEER A] So why do you
think they stopped showing up?

00:10:47.194 --> 00:10:48.462
[SMILE OVERSEER B]
No clue.

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:53.741
[SMILE OVERSEER A] Well,
if we can't enslave any more,

00:10:53.774 --> 00:10:57.280
we'll have to work the butts off
the 500 we already have.

00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:59.753
How 'bout some tough love?

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:02.257
[CHAO yells]

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:28.075
[SMILE OVERSEER D]
Hm? What gives?

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.048
This Smile Fruit doesn't
look ripe enough yet!

00:11:33.853 --> 00:11:35.858
Are you okay?

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:38.630
Start talking! I thought
Tontatta could grow anything,

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.133
so what's with this crap?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.237
We usually can!

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.842
These Smile fruits aren't
exactly natural, though.

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:47.280
Hey, no excuses!

00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:50.587
Could you give my brother
a few minutes to rest please?

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.096
Today's meal was a little
bit spoiled, you see.

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:57.233
[SMILE OVERSEER D] Now you're
complaining about the food?

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:59.338
Wanna cure your princess?

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:02.211
You know just how
sick Mancherie is.

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.414
[DWARF C]
Yes! Yes, we do!

00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:07.121
Then get your ass back
to farmin' more fruit.

00:12:07.154 --> 00:12:08.857
You know they're an
essential ingredient

00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:12.030
in making her medication,
or did you forget?

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.670
The number of acceptable
fruits you produce

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:18.910
in one season is less than
10% of what you're harvesting.

00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:21.583
You need to find a way to
increase your productivity.

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:25.590
D'you think we could
see Princess Mancherie?

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:27.795
No way!

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.599
[BOTH]
Why not, though?

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.268
Because--

00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:40.888
If you were to
contract her illness,

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:42.123
we would be devastated!

00:12:42.156 --> 00:12:43.325
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:44.930
[SMILE OVERSEER D] We would
never forgive ourselves

00:12:44.963 --> 00:12:46.800
if we allowed anything
terrible to happen

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:49.572
to our beloved
Tontatta partners!

00:12:53.914 --> 00:12:56.986
Aww. Mr. Underling!

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.592
[DWARF A] We're gonna push
ourselves to work even harder!

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:03.198
[DWARF C] Please continue to
take good care of our princess!

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:04.569
[SMILE OVERSEER D]
All right!

00:13:05.704 --> 00:13:08.977
[SMILE OVERSEER D] They're so
gullible I almost feel bad.

00:13:10.079 --> 00:13:12.918
[LEO]
Why, Robiland? Why stop me?

00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:16.760
I'm sorry. However,
if I hadn't done something,

00:13:16.793 --> 00:13:18.429
then you would have gotten hurt.

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:19.598
Huh?

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.468
[ROBIN]
That fly he sniped...

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:26.111
I see.

00:13:29.084 --> 00:13:32.691
He somehow shot it
right between the eyes.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.168
Trebol's vision must be
exceptional. And his aim.

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.808
I believe it's far too
dangerous to approach Sugar

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.811
while he's watching over her.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:47.988
So. You got anything
for a plan B?

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:52.097
I do. First off, we need
to separate those two.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.303
You do realize that's
easier said than done, right?

00:13:55.336 --> 00:13:58.476
Usoland! Give us
guidance-- We need you!

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.444
[gasps]

00:13:59.478 --> 00:14:02.585
[DWARVES]
Usoland, our legendary hero!

00:14:02.619 --> 00:14:04.822
You can count on me.

00:14:11.736 --> 00:14:13.072
That goes there.

00:14:15.142 --> 00:14:16.646
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A screams]

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.683
[IBUSU]
Hey, what's up with this cargo?

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:21.856
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A screams]
It's a swarm of pink hornets!

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.931
[BIAN giggles]

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.968
[ROBIN] I have an urgent
report for Mr. Trebol!

00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:31.509
[pants] Sir, we have a problem!

00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:32.744
Captain Yves' pirates are

00:14:32.778 --> 00:14:35.651
causing a disturbance
in sector 4!

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:37.420
They are demanding to
speak to an Executive

00:14:37.453 --> 00:14:40.193
about renegotiating the price.

00:14:40.226 --> 00:14:43.166
[TREBOL] Hmm? They think
they don't have to

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.236
be afraid of Joker anymore?

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:47.574
That takes some nerve, huh?

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:55.490
Huh? Hey. You're not the
regular messenger, are you?

00:14:55.524 --> 00:14:56.526
[gasps]

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.168
He's on a lunch break
right now, that's all!

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:02.605
It's an emergency!

00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:04.909
There's already been
a few casualties reported!

00:15:04.943 --> 00:15:06.245
Please come quickly!

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:10.486
Casualties, huh? Okay.

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.812
Hey, hey!

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:40.881
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Yes, Trebol?

00:15:40.915 --> 00:15:42.216
Are you headed somewhere?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.791
Tighten up security at the four
doors to the Executive Tower.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:47.093
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Yes, sir!

00:15:48.362 --> 00:15:51.401
And if anything goes wrong,
do let me know at once.

00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:52.804
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Yes, sir!

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.751
Master Trebol!

00:15:58.784 --> 00:16:00.352
Keep up the good work, sir!

00:16:00.386 --> 00:16:03.694
Hey, hey! So where is it?

00:16:03.727 --> 00:16:04.995
Where's the fight, huh?

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.231
This way.

00:16:10.172 --> 00:16:14.247
Huh? You mean you're not gonna
fight alongside us, Usoland?

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.253
I could handle this mess easily.

00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:20.126
[USOPP]
Yeah right. I'm staying safe!

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:22.063
But I think I should
let you guys do it.

00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:24.201
To build up your
self-confidence!

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.470
Confidence.

00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:26.438
That makes sense!

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:28.442
Wow, that's really
considerate of you!

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:30.747
And don't worry!
If anything goes wrong,

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.851
I'll jump in and
take over, okay?

00:16:32.884 --> 00:16:33.553
[DWARVES cheer]

00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:34.856
Well, that's good to know!

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:36.526
Our future's safe with you!

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.164
[DWARVES]
Usoland, our legendary hero!

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.301
That's me!

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.450
[SUGAR]
Huh? Someone there?

00:17:03.246 --> 00:17:04.314
Here goes!

00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:11.929
[USOPP]
Oh! He pulled it off!

00:17:11.963 --> 00:17:15.604
Now we wait for her to pop that
Tatababasco clump in her mouth!

00:17:41.354 --> 00:17:43.191
[USOPP]
Not that one!

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:50.840
[USOPP]
Maybe this time.

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:13.820
[LEO yells]

00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:16.091
[USOPP]
Don't yell, you pea brain!

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.436
[LEO] If Operation Sugar
Over-surprised Panic

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.242
is a failure,
it's going to ruin everything

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:27.447
we've worked so hard for!

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.017
We have no other choice!

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.185
[ALL]
Mm.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.033
We're here on a mission.
Don't try to stop us!

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.907
[USOPP]
What're they doing?

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.412
Whatever it takes, we are
going to rescue our friends

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:45.951
who are enslaved here
in the factory!

00:18:45.984 --> 00:18:49.224
But first, we're gonna
knock you out cold, Sugar!

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:52.229
But why? Huh?

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:55.637
You're so mean. I don't know
anything about your friends!

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.440
--[INHEL, BOMBA] Huh?
--Really, truly?

00:18:57.473 --> 00:18:59.243
[DWARVES]
Huh?

00:18:59.277 --> 00:18:59.979
[SUGAR]
Yeah.

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:00.980
Aww, it's okay!

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:03.151
You're being fooled!
It's not okay!

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:03.820
[ALL gasp]

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:05.056
Oh, close one!

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:07.226
You'll free our friends now!

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:10.165
Who put you up to this?

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:12.805
We've been cheating you for
ages and you little dim-wits

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:15.811
never had so much as a clue.

00:19:15.844 --> 00:19:17.480
I was curious.

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:19.351
You used to come to
the palace all the time,

00:19:19.384 --> 00:19:21.789
but I haven't seen you
in the past year.

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:26.565
I guess somebody has been
leading you astray, huh?

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:28.603
Attack now!

00:19:28.637 --> 00:19:31.709
Pry her mouth open
and hold her still!

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.118
I'm not amused.

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.456
I don't like it when
people think I'm weak.

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:44.601
[DWARVES yelling]

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:52.383
Now you're all
"Little Black Bears"!

00:19:58.361 --> 00:19:59.632
The contract.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:03.507
[FLAPPER] Oh no!
She turned us into toys!

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.376
[SUGAR]
You shall follow my every order

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.448
until the day you perish.

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:11.255
[FLAPPER] Don't tell me they
forgot about us already?

00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:12.658
[LEO]
A bear army?

00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:15.263
Where did all those
teddy soldiers come from?

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:17.934
And weren't we in the
middle of something just now?

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.139
Kill everyone in
the Executive Tower!

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:21.876
And do it immediately!

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.247
[FLAPPER]
I can't disobey her orders!

00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:27.521
[USOPP]
Kill everyone? Including me?

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:34.267
[DWARF G]
Please! I don't want to do this!

00:20:34.301 --> 00:20:36.606
Those bears must be
working for Sugar!

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:39.010
I thought the only one she
had guarding her was Trebol,

00:20:39.043 --> 00:20:40.780
but it looks like we were wrong!

00:20:40.813 --> 00:20:43.653
[FLAPPER]
Leo! It's me! Flapper!

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:45.991
All right, guys! Get the enemy!

00:20:46.024 --> 00:20:48.796
[DWARVES yell]

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.836
[FLAPPER]
No! No! No!

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.744
No!

00:20:55.777 --> 00:21:00.186
[SUGAR] Trebol, come back
at once! It was a trap!

00:21:00.219 --> 00:21:01.956
Trebol!

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:07.433
Huh? A trap? Hey!

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:10.305
Master Trebol, please look!
They're all starting to fight!

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:13.111
It's utter chaos!
You have to do something!

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:14.147
Huh?

00:21:17.387 --> 00:21:19.057
Hey, hey! You guys okay?

00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:20.259
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:21:20.293 --> 00:21:22.163
I heard there's a dilemma?

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:23.800
Master Trebol!

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.269
Well? Go on now!

00:21:25.303 --> 00:21:27.641
Well, it's basically
nothing, sir.

00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:31.147
We're just a bit jumpy because
we found hornets in our cargo.

00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:33.920
Rest assured, this won't
have any affect on our deal!

00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:37.426
She did lie!

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:42.938
Hey, hey, wait!

00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:44.708
Here comes Trebol!

00:21:44.742 --> 00:21:46.144
Nice try!

00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:50.452
Hey! Hey! Who exactly
are you, huh? A spy?

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:53.727
Huh? [gasps]

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.064
Ah! Where did she go?

00:21:56.098 --> 00:21:59.203
Hey! Hey!

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:02.343
[gasps] Wait a second.
I know her!

00:22:07.053 --> 00:22:09.692
She's in the Straw Hat Crew!

00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:11.795
How'd she get down here?

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:13.867
[SUGAR]
Trebol!

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.704
[TREBOL]
Why are they going after Sugar?

00:22:15.737 --> 00:22:17.006
Get back up here!

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.812
You were fooled, you good
for nothing idiot! Die!

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:23.285
Huh?! I'm mad now!

00:22:27.894 --> 00:22:30.867
[TREBOL]
Sticky-Sticky Chain!

00:22:33.807 --> 00:22:35.810
[yells]

00:22:36.946 --> 00:22:38.683
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:22:41.021 --> 00:22:45.129
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:22:45.162 --> 00:22:47.801
Stick-Stickem...

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:49.237
What's that?

00:22:59.257 --> 00:23:01.729
[TREBOL]
Meteora!

00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.058
[NARRATOR]
The destruction caused by

00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.427
Trebol's violent attack

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.734
brings Leo and the Tontatta's
plans to a sudden halt.

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:23.338
It seems the only hope left
for King Riku and his Army

00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:25.944
falls on the shoulders
of the Toy Solider.

00:23:25.978 --> 00:23:28.282
Once known as a legend
throughout Dressrosa,

00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:30.954
his true identity is
about to be revealed!

00:23:30.988 --> 00:23:32.658
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.691 --> 00:23:36.031
"The Last Light of Hope!
The Secret of Our Commander!"

00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:38.869
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
