Franky like that.

176
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,662
I call it the Pad Cannon.

177
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,732
I simply deflect air
pressure at light speed,

178
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:35,236
and it creates a shock wave that
can pierce through anything.

179
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:54,789
I don't believe in mercy.

180
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,794
Feel my Thrust Pad Cannon!

181
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,167
[ZORO]
Streaming Wolf Swords!

182
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,515
Zoro!

183
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,684
He can even repel his swords?

184
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:36,230
Damn it.

185
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,735
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
This is pointless!

186
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,737
There's no way
he can keep going!

187
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:44,538
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
It's a miracle he's gone

188
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,941
this long in the
condition he's in!

189
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,676
You saw the beating
he took from Oars!

190
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,579
If this guy lays a finger
on him, he's done for!

191
00:12:56,884 --> 00:13:00,321
Zoro! Look behind you! Run!

192
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,160
Zoro!

193
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,462
[SANJI] That's as
far as you'll get!

194
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,703
Concasser!

195
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:18,906
Sanji!

196
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:21,242
He didn't have the
chance to deflect his kick!

197
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:24,945
His skull's gotta be in a
thousand pieces! Awesome!

198
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,552
Idiot! I said not to butt in!

199
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:53,440
I take it you're
Black Leg Sanji.

200
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,442
I expected more from you.

201
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:58,512
He kicked him in the face
and he didn't even flinch.

202
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,248
This just keeps getting
worse and worse!

203
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:01,916
What the hell?

204
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:03,918
Is his face made of steel?

205
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,620
That kick should've
busted in his skull.

206
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:13,894
Go now Phoenix Star!

207
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,298
The King of Snipers
steps to the plate.

208
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,433
A title you clearly
gave yourself.

209
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,438
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
I knew this was pointless!

210
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,707
They haven't even
fazed that monster!

211
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,809
[ROLLING PIRATE 376B]
They're dead meat against him!

212
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:12,586
[CHOPPER]
Zoro! Sanji!

213
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,199
[KUMA] I knew from the
start that killing a crew

214
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,869
of injured weaklings like
you would bring me no joy.

215
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,205
Not to mention that
it's not a fair fight.

216
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:41,041
But orders are orders,

217
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:43,911
even if I may not
fully agree with them.

218
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,195
[FRANKY] What the
hell is he doing?

219
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,896
[NAMI]
Is that air?

220
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,599
It looks like a giant
bubble shaped like a paw.

221
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:08,001
[CHOPPER] And he keeps
making it smaller.

222
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,328
I think I know what he's doing.

223
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:37,164
He's using his power to
deflect a giant air mass,

224
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,900
but he's compressing
it into a tiny ball.

225
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:42,436
[ROBIN] The real
attack will come

226
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,572
as soon as he releases all
of that compressed pressure.

227
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,407
That much air...

228
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,509
It'll send out a
massive shock wave.

229
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:50,277
Like an enormous bomb.

230
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,416
Did... I hear you right?

231
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,522
Like a bomb?

232
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:05,159
You mean he's gonna release
that and blow us all up?

233
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:07,294
This is bad.

234
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:53,040
I've thought it over,
and I've made a decision.

235
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,175
I will spare your lives.

236
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,378
But on one condition.

237
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:00,614
In exchange for this
act of magnanimity,

238
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,550
you give me the head
of Straw Hat Luffy.

239
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,071
If I return with him.

240
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,040
That should be enough
to satisfy the government.

241
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:49,363
We won't betray our own captain.

242
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:19,560
Now then.

243
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,095
Hand him over before
I change my mind.

244
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,402
[ALL]
Never!

245
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,018
This was your choice.

246
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,499
Now suffer the Ursa Shock.

247
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,308
[SANJI]
Stay out of this, moss head!

248
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,510
I'm taking Kuma down on my own.

249
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:26,713
[ZORO]
No, you're staying out of this!

250
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:27,814
[SANJI]
What the hell?

251
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:28,548
Why did you...?

252
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:30,317
[ZORO]
'Cause you're the cook.

253
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,353
It's a warriors job to
risk his life in combat.

254
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:34,788
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

255
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:37,224
"The Pain of My
Crewmates is My Pain.

256
00:23:37,257 --> 00:23:38,959
Zoro's Desperate Fight."

257
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:41,361
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
