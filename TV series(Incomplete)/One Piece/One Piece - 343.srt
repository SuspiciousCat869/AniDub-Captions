1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,949
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,410
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:45,081
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:50,128
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,007
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,385
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,637
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,266
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,227
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,147
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,110
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfas!

48
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,613
That's Dr. Hogback's
laugh, for sure!

49
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,323
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,492
So is this
the secret lab?

51
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,162
I sure hope it is!

52
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,583
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfas!

53
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,419
My work is almost finished!

54
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,131
At last!
My beautiful marionette!

55
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,259
Fasfasfasfas!

56
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,677
Behold, Cindry!

57
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,598
This is a true work of art!
The work of a genius!

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,308
What we're
about to see here is

59
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,310
the creation of a new zombie.

60
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,187
And that means
that Dr. Hogback made

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,482
all of the other undead
creatures on the island as well.

62
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,525
There's no other explanation.

63
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,572
[RYUMA]
Nyohohohoho!

64
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,075
Good evening!

65
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,409
What's the matter?

66
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,119
If you're going to
stand there and stare,

67
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,372
you might as well go inside.

68
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,623
"Yo ho ho ho?"

69
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,251
That isn't Brook, is it?

70
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,214
[groaning]

71
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,591
It's an old man
with serious injuries.

72
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,511
Are you nuts?
It's a zombie!

73
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,222
Don't make fun of me!

74
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,146
[SANJI] Are zombies
usually this energetic?

75
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,233
I'll show you how
dangerous zombies can really be!

76
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,985
Oh, you guys
want a fight, huh?

77
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,029
Then I'll show you how
dangerous pirates can be!

78
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,622
[CREW] 600 Million
Berry Jackpot!

79
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,502
[LUFFY] "His Name is Moria!

80
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,255
The Great Shadow-Seizing
Pirate's Trap."

81
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,178
[LUFFY] So, what are all
you guys doing out here, huh?

82
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,514
[ZOMBIE 343A]
Well, zombie stuff, mostly.

83
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,391
You know, being buried.

84
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,393
[ZOMBIE 340G] Hanging out.
Rotting and stuff.

85
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
[ZOMBIE 340D] Yeah. Pretty
much rotting and hanging out.

86
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,646
[ZOMBIE 343B] Yep. Same here.

87
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,692
[LUFFY] You're not
lying to me, are you?

88
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,360
No! Really!
That's the truth!

89
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,280
We swear! Zombie stuff!
That's all!

90
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,323
[LUFFY] I see.

91
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,325
Then let me ask you something:

92
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,703
Did a man with a long nose,
a woman with orange hair,

93
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,373
and a reindeer that looks like
a raccoon-dog come through here?

94
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,793
Oh. Yeah. Right, right, right.

95
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,213
We may have seen them,
but we're not supposed to...

96
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,715
Sorry. We can't say.

97
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah. We're all under
specific orders not to

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,804
share any information about
stuff like that with anyone.

99
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,473
Sorry 'bout that.

100
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,141
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 343A] Yeah!
We have our orders!

101
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,142
Huh?

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,478
Orders! Orders! Orders!

103
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,316
Orders! Orders!
Orders! Orders! Orders!

104
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,278
[LUFFY] Oh, I see. So you're
not gonna tell me, huh?

105
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,198
I mean, yeah! We saw 'em!

106
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,325
These zombies are wimps.

107
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,659
Wow.

108
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,580
Those guys are part of my crew.

109
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,501
Listen up. You didn't do
anything to them, did you?

110
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,170
Wait. They're on your crew?

111
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,506
No! We didn't! Right?

112
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,467
Right! We did nothing at all!

113
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,676
Nothing at all!

114
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:33,559
[ZOMBIES] Nothing at all!
Nothing at all! Nothing at all!

115
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,853
I want the truth. Right now.

116
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,522
This guy did something.

117
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,691
Hey! Shut up! Tattle tale!

118
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,694
And anyway, you're
the one that bit 'em!

119
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,863
Actually, we all did.

120
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,698
Idiot! Shut up!

121
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,118
Ah!!

122
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:11,806
[sounds of fighting]

123
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,814
[LUFFY] Looks like
they ran outta here

124
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,441
and headed for that mansion.

125
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,733
I'm glad they're alright.

126
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,194
Not sure about Brook, though.

127
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,321
[SANJI] That's fine.
Don't worry about him.

128
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,283
[ZORO] Let's find the others.

129
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,593
Oh, man. How lame!

130
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,803
Those zombies were
a bunch of weaklings.

131
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,054
Yup.

132
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,349
Pounding their sorry faces in
doesn't even count as a warm up!

133
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,685
Still, this is no
time to let your guard down.

134
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,312
You never know when
someone a lot stronger

135
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,814
than those guys is gonna pop up.

136
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,773
Whoa. Wait.

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,526
You're not getting scared,
are you, buddy?

138
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,611
Gonna cry?

139
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,571
Up yours! I'm not scared!

140
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,491
A swordsman is never
afraid of the dark!

141
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,910
We'll see, when
I knock your lights out!

142
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,828
Come on! You wanna
piece of me?

143
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,707
[MALE VOICE] Wait!
Stop! Hold on a minute!

144
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:24,337
[heavy breathing]

145
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,006
I saw you fight those zombies.

146
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,718
All of you have such
unbelievable strength!

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,305
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

148
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,640
Would you please listen?

149
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,558
Old man with serious injuries!

150
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,311
Idiot! We told you!
They're zombies!

151
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,356
Uh. Actually, he's
right on the money.

152
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,565
That's too confusing!

153
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,360
Can't you just
be a zombie? Jeez!

154
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:50,821
Alright. So what did
you want to tell us?

155
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,824
[SPOIL] There's an evil man
who must be brought down!

156
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,661
And I think you youngsters
are strong enough to do it!

157
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,372
He's left a trail
of victims in his wake.

158
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,041
If you defeat him,
they'll all be rescued!

159
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,711
If you'd help me get my shadow
back, I'd be ever so grateful!

160
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,546
Your shadow?

161
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,714
Hold on, did we
just find another guy

162
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,841
who had his shadow taken away?

163
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,886
Lemme take a look.
It's true! See?

164
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,013
He really doesn't have a shadow!

165
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,474
He's just like Brook!

166
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,767
Well damn. That sucks.

167
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,436
So who did that to you?
Is he here?

168
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,896
Somewhere on this island?

169
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,043
Mor... Moria.

170
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,798
His name is Moria.
And he's terrifying.

171
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,884
Moria?
You don't mean--

172
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,471
[ROBIN] Gecko Moria,
by any chance?

173
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,809
[SPOIL] That's right.
Yes. That's him.

174
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,769
[LUFFY] Robin,
do you know this guy?

175
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,439
[ROBIN] Yes, but only by name.

176
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,940
And if I remember correctly,

177
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,027
his former bounty was even
higher than yours, Luffy.

178
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,113
[SANJI] Wait. "Former"?
So that means--

179
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,239
[ROBIN] Yes.

180
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:20,077
Gecko Moria is one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

181
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
[CREW] He is?

182
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,668
Are you sure? Really?

183
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,173
Yes. Gecko Moria is a
man of many mysteries.

184
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,799
But, what's a big shot like

185
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,135
that doing in a
dump hole like this?

186
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,803
[SPOIL] I'm not sure, exactly.

187
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,015
What I can tell you is that
he's left behind many victims,

188
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,644
most of which are wandering
around lost in this very forest.

189
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,062
[ZORO] Just how many is "many"?

190
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,063
[SPOIL] Who knows?

191
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,690
The fact that you were
all invited here as well

192
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,443
means that Moria is
out to get you, too!

193
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,778
No doubt about it!

194
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,613
Invited? We weren't--

195
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,663
I see. Huh.

196
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,583
[sobs]

197
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,211
We hide in this dark forest,

198
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:14,090
scared of zombies and
all the other creatures here.

199
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,841
We can't head out to sea

200
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,094
because we'll be
exposed to the sun!

201
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,221
With this body
weakened the way it is,

202
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,849
it's hard to find the
will to keep on living.

203
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,017
Once.

204
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,562
Just once before I die,
I want to walk under the sun!

205
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,606
To feel its warmth on my skin!

206
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,109
Just one more time!

207
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,804
Bwaahahahahah!

208
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,725
That's awful! How touching!
You've been through so much!

209
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,226
Such a gut wrenching story!

210
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,019
But I'm not crying, got it?

211
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,564
Jerk! You won't make me cry!

212
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,649
Oh, come on, you big crybaby.

213
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,569
You're way too compassionate
about this kind of stuff.

214
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,820
Enough of this!

215
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,782
Hey, creepy grandpa!

216
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,161
Only ladies get to persuade
people with their tears!

217
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,663
Show a little backbone, will ya?

218
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,081
[thinknig] Oh, boy.

219
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,710
Well, you're in luck.

220
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,045
We're actually looking for
a guy that steals shadows,

221
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,047
and I'm pretty
sure he's the one.

222
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,301
If he's coming after us, then
that just makes things easier.

223
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,552
I'm gonna kick his ass,

224
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,972
and if that saves you while
we're at it, it's fine by me.

225
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,182
Okay?

226
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,143
Oh! That's very kind of you!

227
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,897
Thank you! Thank you!
You've given me new hope!

228
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,106
[VICTIM 343A]
We can't thank you enough!

229
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,316
[VICTIM 343B]
We're counting on you!

230
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
[VICTIM 343C] Yeah!
Tear Moria a new one!

231
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,862
What the hell?
The other victims, huh?

232
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,781
It's not polite to eavesdrop!

233
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,865
[RANDOM VICTIM 343A] Oh!

234
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,743
Sorry about that, Mister
Freaky Curly Eyebrows Guy!

235
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,912
[SANJI] That's a
crappy way to apologize!

236
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,121
[LUFFY chuckles]

237
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,089
Oh. What the hell?

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,717
Gaaaaah!

239
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,774
You three?
Why are you here?

240
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
Hey. That guy was--

241
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,820
Well, I could have sworn
it was Brook back there!

242
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,445
Yeah, I know!

243
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,072
But he wasn't a skeleton.

244
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,199
He had skin. Like a mummy!

245
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,116
[USOPP] He had wooden clogs...

246
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,871
Hey! Listen to me
when I talk to you!

247
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
Then maybe.

248
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,628
You fools!

249
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,923
He found us!

250
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,845
Indeed! Now.
What did you see?

251
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,931
Didn't I tell you never to
peek into my research room?

252
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,850
We didn't see anything!

253
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,185
Right! Nothing! We swear!

254
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,938
Uh-huh. I didn't
see anything at all!

255
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,981
Really?

256
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,858
Really! It's the honest truth!

257
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,361
We certainly didn't see--
that zombie you were making!

258
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
Dumbass!

259
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,826
Alright, fine then.

260
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,036
[HOGBACK] I'm sure
you've figured out some

261
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,249
of my secrets by now,
but you're too late.

262
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:40,629
In but a few minutes,
the Night Hunt will begin!

263
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,843
The Night Hunt?

264
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,804
[HOGBACK] Woe unto
those foolish enough

265
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,222
to wander this
island after dark.

266
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:57,438
No intruder shall
survive the Night Hunt!

267
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,361
[ABSALOM] You can't properly
start the Night Hunt

268
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,322
if you're still buried,
now can you?

269
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,336
[ABSALOM] What are you doing?

270
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,546
You can't hurt! There's no pain!

271
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,340
It's all in your imagination!

272
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,467
You guys are all dead! Get it?

273
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,635
Oh, yeah.

274
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,559
[ABSALOM] Now, rise!
Zombie Soldiers!

275
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,861
[ABSALOM] No matter
how many times you fall,

276
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,406
you get back up
and attack again!

277
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,784
That's what makes a
zombie so terrifying!

278
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,953
[ZOMBIES] Yeah, we know.

279
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,416
[ABSALOM] Don't be like that!
Stop slacking off!

280
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,668
Get a grip on
yourselves, zombies!

281
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,587
Now which one of you
wants to tell me who I am?

282
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,548
I know! The Leader!

283
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:51,885
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 343B ]
Our glorious Leader! Absalom!

284
00:16:51,885 --> 00:17:01,937
[ZOMBIES] Leader! Leader!
Leader! Leader! Leader! Leader!

285
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:21,957
[ZOMBIES] Leader! Leader!
Leader! Leader! Leader! Leader!

286
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:28,964
[ZOMBIES] Leader! Leader!
Leader! Leader! Leader! Leader!

287
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,383
Who likes to peek at girls!

288
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:37,890
Leader! Pervert!
Pervert! Pervert!

289
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,851
Shut up!

290
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,362
Horo horo horo horo horo!

291
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,115
Horo horo horo horo horo!

292
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,870
Horo horo horo horo horo!

293
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,789
[KUMACY]
Oooo!

294
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,048
[KUMACY] Oo! Oo! Welcome back,
Mistress Perona!

295
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,634
How are you?

296
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,844
[PERONA] Shut up, Kumacy!

297
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,763
Ugh! Your voice is so deep!

298
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,599
It's gross! Just can it okay?

299
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,438
[KUMACY] My apologies.

300
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,447
[PERONA] Either be
cute or get lost!

301
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,658
I won't have ugly
things working for me!

302
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,493
Horo horo horo horo.

303
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,043
[NIN] Hurry! Hurry up!

304
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,129
[GYORO] It's starting!
It's starting!

305
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,672
[BAO] Time for the Night Hunt!

306
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,674
[NIN] Twelve O'Clock Midnight!

307
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,008
Moria! Master!

308
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,552
Master Moria!

309
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,096
It's time to get up, Master!

310
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,016
[snoring]

311
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,476
Nin! Do it!

312
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,019
[NIN] Right! Here goes!

313
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,570
[ALL THREE] Master Moria!

314
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,531
[MORIA] I was
having a bad dream!

315
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,617
[NIN] Really? Great!
Aren't those the best, Master?

316
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,077
[GYORO]
Master Moria has been sleeping

317
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,079
since the Night Hunt
four days ago.

318
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,123
Even so, that hasn't stopped us!

319
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,958
Knowing that you'd be
hungry when you awoke,

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,877
we have prepared
a very special meal

321
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,004
that's sure to
appease your appetite.

322
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,839
And they're a tough bunch!

323
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,591
Amazing fighters, too!

324
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:39,261
They're the pirates that brought
down the island of Enies Lobby.

325
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,263
Known as
"The Straw Hat Pirates!"

326
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,056
Aren't you pleased? Master!

327
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,726
Imagine what you
could do with them!

328
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,061
Kushishishi!

329
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,902
Is that rain?

330
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,863
Man, that sure came
from out of nowhere.

331
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,865
[FRANKY]
It's really coming down, too.

332
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,033
Should we run for the mansion?

333
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,117
[LUFFY] Hang on a sec.

334
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,076
Huh?

335
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,079
I see something really
big by the mansion.

336
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:10,083
Over there. It looks
like some kind of mark.

337
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,585
[FRANKY] A mark?

338
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,129
The rain's clearing the fog.

339
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:17,799
I see it. Is that a flag?

340
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,095
No. I'm pretty
sure that's a sail.

341
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,932
[LUFFY] What?

342
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,768
Yes, you're right.

343
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,937
Hey! Why're you
still following us?

344
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,564
Right about what?

345
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,565
Like he said.

346
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,985
What you see is a sail
of gigantic proportion.

347
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,945
It's so large that seeing

348
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,323
the entire thing at
once is quite difficult.

349
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,160
You see, Thriller Bark is not
the island it appears to be.

350
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,790
Believe it or not, it's actually
the world's largest pirate ship!

351
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,125
This whole island
is a pirate ship?

352
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,169
The largest one in the world?

353
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,588
Awesome!

354
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,132
I get it.
So "Thriller Bark," huh?

355
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,636
A bark is a type of sailing ship
with three or more masts.

356
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,888
But it's hard to believe
this entire island

357
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,181
is some sort of boat.

358
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,349
[SPOIL] The back of
the mansion is where

359
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,059
you'll find the main mast.

360
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,104
It's also the home
of Gecko Moria.

361
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,742
Now! Zombie Soldiers!

362
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,161
The Zombie Generals
will lead the attack.

363
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,956
Let's finish off those pirates!

364
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,711
The rest of you
will find ways to corner

365
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,005
and overtake those among
them that fear the undead.

366
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,673
Show them no mercy.

367
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,383
Together, we will crush them.

368
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,760
Now go! Make me proud!

369
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,920
[PERONA] There's the bell!

370
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,174
The moment has arrived.
It's time to get serious.

371
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,884
Horo horo horo horo.

372
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,428
If those pirates think they
can escape this place alive,

373
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,972
they're gravely mistaken.

374
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,391
Are the preparations
complete, my zombies?

375
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,687
[cheering]

376
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:44,404
[MORIA] In this dark realm,
one of ghosts, and ghouls.

377
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,866
This place we
call Thriller Bark.

378
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,701
They are going to
see nothing short

379
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,121
of the nightmare to
end all nightmares!

380
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,056
Well, here we go.
To the Ghost Mansion!

381
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,400
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

382
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,820
It finally begins!
Are you ready, Absalom!

383
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,155
[ABSALOM] Of course I am,
who do you think's in charge?

384
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,198
[HOGBACK] Me!

385
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,325
[ABSALOM] Go wild,
Zombie Generals!

386
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:34,037
[HOGBACK] Uh, yes.
Zombie Generals. Go wild.

387
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,372
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

388
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,165
"Feast of the Zombie Song!

389
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,043
The Night Hunt's Bell
is the Sound of Darkness!"

390
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,212
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
