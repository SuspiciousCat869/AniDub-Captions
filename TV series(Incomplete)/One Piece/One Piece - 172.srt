1
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,749
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,208
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,878
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,546
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,050
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,068
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,572
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,784
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,869
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:42,175
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,055
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:52,435
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,312
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:59,275
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,319
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:07,075
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:14,165
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:21,965
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:33,101
[NARRATOR] While trying
to escape the Upper Yard,

25
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:35,145
Nami's group was
confronted by Eneru

26
00:02:35,228 --> 00:02:37,605
who displayed
his fearsome power.

27
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,483
Meanwhile, the four search team
members became separated

28
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,818
and Luffy clashed

29
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:45,321
with the leader of the
Shandorian Warriors, Wyper.

30
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:50,285
[LUFFY]
Gum-gum...

31
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,579
Now you die!

32
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,043
[LUFFY, WYPER]
...Bazooka!

33
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,681
[NARRATOR]
Then, Nami's team encountered

34
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,558
a deadly new pair of enemies.

35
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:16,603
Ha! You can call me Hotori!

36
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:19,898
Ha! And you can call me Kotori!

37
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:23,026
And you guys killed
our beloved big brother Satori.

38
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,527
Ha-ha!

39
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,237
[NARRATOR] And after
becoming hopelessly lost,

40
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,616
Chopper came face to face
with Sky Punk Gedatsu.

41
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:31,951
Come out right now!

42
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:37,123
[CHOPPER shrieks]

43
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,834
[LUFFY]
"The Ordeal of the Swamp!

44
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,671
Chopper vs. Sky Punk Gedatsu!"

45
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,916
[ROBIN]
A memorial to the city itself.

46
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,881
Its descendants built it.

47
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:29,342
After the great city fell.

48
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,388
[ROBIN]
Shandora.

49
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:36,099
That was the name
of this ancient place.

50
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,814
[ROBIN]
402 S.E.

51
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,151
The city, was at its
peak 11 hundred years ago.

52
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:50,321
But then it toppled
around 800 years ago.

53
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,118
That time frame
almost perfectly matches

54
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,786
the hundred years
of history that vanished

55
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,830
from the rest of the world.

56
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:01,583
Perhaps this
island holds the key.

57
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,794
The key to a
long-forgotten history,

58
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:07,756
that was veiled
from the world below.

59
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,843
[ROBIN] This is a complete
map of Shandora.

60
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:14,304
Perhaps I'll learn more
about this "Blank Century"

61
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:17,182
if I go to the
center of the city.

62
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,226
Who's there?

63
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,937
Well, aren't you a
beautiful young lady?

64
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,607
[ROBIN] Are you another
one of Eneru's henchmen?

65
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,442
Henchman?

66
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:29,277
You had better watch your mouth.

67
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,237
I am Yama, Divine Commander

68
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:34,282
in the service of
God Eneru himself.

69
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:36,242
And what exactly
do you want from me,

70
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,286
Divine Commander Yama?

71
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,954
I don't want to talk.

72
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:43,458
[roars]

73
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,261
Where did you go?

74
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:00,725
[GEDATSU] A concealment
technique no doubt.

75
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:03,144
[CHOPPER] His eyes
are rolled back in his head.

76
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,189
And it's really spooky!

77
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:12,195
Gedatsu, you can't see the enemy

78
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,614
with your eyes
rolled back like that!

79
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:15,615
[gasps]

80
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,575
So careless!

81
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,577
[CHOPPER]
What a dimwit!

82
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,705
[CHOPPER]
An enemy huh?

83
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:22,956
Oh, I get it now.

84
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,667
You must be one Eneru's priests.

85
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,465
[GEDATSU]
Indeed, I am.

86
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,176
Let me introduce myself.

87
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,514
My name is Gedatsu, priest in
the service of Almighty Eneru.

88
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:40,890
Huh?

89
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:42,642
[GEDATSU]
And I command the Upper Yard's

90
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,769
Ordeal of the Swamp.

91
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:45,812
Huh?

92
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:48,148
C'mon, say something you jerk!

93
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:50,942
[DIVINE BAA]
Gedatsu, he can't hear you

94
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:52,986
unless you start
speaking out loud!

95
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,738
So careless!

96
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,948
You don't normally forget that.

97
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,408
[GEDATSU]
Hmph!

98
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:03,163
I advise you to watch
where you step.

99
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,372
See.

100
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:07,250
This entire area is
my territory to control!

101
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,169
All around us are swamp clouds.

102
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,087
And once you find
yourself trapped by one

103
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,006
there is no hope of escape.

104
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:15,675
The survival rate
here is 50 percent.

105
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,469
It's almost tragic.

106
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:19,888
Ordeal of the Swamp!

107
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,014
"The swamp"?

108
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,599
Best of luck.

109
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,518
Hey, you're sinking!

110
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:28,104
Fool! It has no effect on me!

111
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:29,773
Swamp cloud.

112
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:33,818
[GEDATSU]
Milky dial!

113
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:41,409
[CHOPPER gasps]

114
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:43,495
No way!

115
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,580
[CHOPPER] He's shooting
something out his feet

116
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,416
that makes him fly!

117
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,379
That's so cool!

118
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:57,384
Something's coming
out of his hands.

119
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:59,302
[GEDATSU] One stinking,
matted raccoon dog

120
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:02,597
is hardly worth
my precious time.

121
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,973
Take this!

122
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,769
Swamp cloud burger!

123
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:10,146
A deadly swamp
with the weight of a cloud.

124
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,149
Once touched,
nothing can survive!

125
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,651
[DIVINE BAA ]
Wait, no, Gedatsu!

126
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,445
Don't aim it at me!
Please, stop!

127
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:26,371
[CHOPPER]
He can't escape!

128
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:29,666
[CHOPPER]
I see!

129
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:30,875
It's a cloud,
so if you try to lift it,

130
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,461
your hands will just
pass right through it!

131
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:39,175
The more you
struggle to get free,

132
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,303
the deeper you're
dragged inside of it!

133
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:47,142
[CHOPPER]
I have to help him!

134
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:49,436
[GEDATSU]
There you are, raccoon dog!

135
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,313
Swamp cloud burger!

136
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:53,898
[screams]

137
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,862
If one of those things hits me,
I'll be dead for sure!

138
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,992
If you're still alive, hang on!

139
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:07,328
Hey!

140
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,415
You gotta breathe!

141
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:12,459
Don't die!

142
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,544
[coughs]

143
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,798
Oh good, you're alive.

144
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,091
Thank you.

145
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,302
You saved my life.

146
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:25,805
[GEDATSU]
Ha!

147
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,807
Being saved by the enemy.

148
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:28,600
Pathetic!

149
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:30,226
[CHOPPER]
Uh-oh!

150
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,271
[GEDATSU] And you call yourself
one of the Divine Warriors.

151
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,815
You're not worthy
of such a title.

152
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:36,524
[DIVINE BAA growls]

153
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:39,027
How dare you, Gedatsu.

154
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,197
You're gonna pay!
I'll never serve you again!

155
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,573
[GEDATSU]
Hmph!

156
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:46,368
Watch, as my axe dial
drains the life from you!

157
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,911
Haa!

158
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,329
Yes. We'll team up.

159
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,289
And together we'll defeat him.

160
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,707
Waa!

161
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,625
Bring it on!

162
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,044
We're not scared of you!

163
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:58,421
[GEDATSU chuckles]

164
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,506
Very well.

165
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,050
This one is called
my jet punch!

166
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,360
[GEDATSU]
The lethal jet dial.

167
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:23,029
Punches accelerated with it
allow you to destroy an enemy

168
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:26,574
before they even realize
the fight has begun.

169
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,870
It's only real defect is that
it also destroys my clothes.

170
00:10:30,954 --> 00:10:34,040
[CHOPPER]
This is a Priest?

171
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:39,045
If I don't get out of here right
now, I'll end up like that guy!

172
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,840
[shrieks]

173
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:43,633
[CHOPPER] I gotta keep
my feet off the clouds!

174
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,635
Those swamp trap
things are everywhere!

175
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,262
If I run on top
of the ruins only,

176
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,223
I can make it to the
forest and solid ground!

177
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,436
[CHOPPER screams]

178
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,524
Just where do you think you're
running off to, raccoon?

179
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,526
Here's another jet punch.

180
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:04,487
[CHOPPER]
Rumble... jumping point!

181
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,702
[CHOPPER] Rumble balls
last for three minutes.

182
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:14,664
If I don't escape within
that time, I will be killed.

183
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:17,000
[GEDATSU]
So, you have Zoan-type powers!

184
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,501
[gasps]

185
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,211
[screams]

186
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:23,173
Too bad. How about another one?!

187
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:23,840
Oh, yeah?

188
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,425
Weight point!

189
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,929
Swamp cloud burger!

190
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:31,181
[CHOPPER]
That again?!

191
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,724
Guard point!

192
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,480
Why that insolent little--!

193
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,981
[CHOPPER]
Brain point!

194
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,444
Rumble Scope! A weak point!

195
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,154
He's got to have
some weak point!

196
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:47,238
Anything'll do!

197
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:49,657
I need to find
a weakness and escape!

198
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:51,993
Jet Punch, contact!

199
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:09,928
[CHOPPER] Even with
my guard up, it's useless.

200
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:37,872
[ROBIN]
You big oaf!

201
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:40,542
Can't you see you're destroying
valuable artifacts?

202
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:44,921
[YAMA laughs] You should
probably concern yourself

203
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,548
with preserving your own life

204
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,551
instead of this
crumbling heap of rubble.

205
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,347
Punch mountain!

206
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,768
Oh no!

207
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,238
Stop this, you fool.

208
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,206
Ugh!

209
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,667
It seems like this
stupid cave goes on forever.

210
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,378
No matter how far I walk
I can't find the way out.

211
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:27,589
[stomach growls]

212
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:30,175
Oh, man I'm getting hungry.

213
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:32,635
I don't see anything
to eat around this place.

214
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,430
I wonder what Chopper and
the others are up to right now.

215
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,308
I hope they're not headed
to the city of gold without me.

216
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,379
[CHOPPER]
His feet.

217
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,130
[chuckles]

218
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,133
That's the weak spot.

219
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,347
[CHOPPER]
Walk point!

220
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,518
[CHOPPER]
Can I escape?

221
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,020
I can't even see straight.

222
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:27,649
Still think you can win?

223
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,655
[CHOPPER]
My legs are shaky at best.

224
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:36,991
And the rumble ball
is about to wear off.

225
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:11,276
[CHOPPER] All right.
It's time to stop running.

226
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,780
[CHOPPER]
You can beat him!

227
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:22,287
[GEDATSU]
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,041
Swamp cloud burger!

229
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,878
[CHOPPER] I'm always
the first to run away,

230
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,589
so everyone thinks
they have to protect me.

231
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:38,053
[CHOPPER] That's why
they can't rely on me.

232
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:41,681
I'm going to raise
a pirate flag right here!

233
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:52,275
Don't you know
when you've lost?

234
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,694
Even the air is
my territory to control.

235
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,154
You can't escape.

236
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,530
[CHOPPER]
C'mon.

237
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,501
Oh no! He took it off.

238
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,128
That raccoon dog took my shoe.

239
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:15,090
So careless!

240
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,471
I'm coming, racoon dog

241
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:28,186
Ahhh! I'm a monster!

242
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:30,522
I'm strong!

243
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:33,650
[laughs] The weakest
beast roars the loudest.

244
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,819
One last jet punch!

245
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,828
I let myself get carried away

246
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:47,330
and nearly lost control
of my mantra.

247
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,791
[CHOPPER]
He only grazed me!

248
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,793
That was close!

249
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,795
Arm point!

250
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,547
I'm alive!

251
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,965
[CHOPPER]
My turn.

252
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,051
Cloven.... Cross!

253
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,280
[screams]

254
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:25,285
Finally, I'm one
of the pirates, too!

255
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,045
[CHOPPER] It looks like he
fell right into a swamp cloud!

256
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,714
Good. Now if he
would just stay there.

257
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:40,383
You hear me? Don't come up.

258
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:43,053
Just keep on sinking, you jerk!

259
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,430
[gasps]

260
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:50,643
[screams]
He's moving!

261
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,440
He's still alive.

262
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:57,942
[GEDATSU] I can't believe
I lost to a raccoon dog.

263
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,278
Of all the things,
I could never live down.

264
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,655
And how did I get stuck
in my own swamp cloud?

265
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,325
This isn't supposed
to happen to me!

266
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,038
[shrieks] Please, oh,
please, just stay down!

267
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,873
Sink! Sink!

268
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:14,501
[GEDATSU]
I can escape with a milky dial.

269
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:19,172
Wow he really sank!

270
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:22,801
[GEDATSU]
So careless!

271
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:28,848
[CHOPPER]
Did I? I did. I really beat him!

272
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:34,270
[GEDATSU]
So careless!

273
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,898
[AISA] Another one
of the priest's voices

274
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,441
just disappeared.

275
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,610
Something terrible
must have happened!

276
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,905
This is bad! I have
to get to the others!

277
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,452
Oh, no! Of course,
you just had to break down

278
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,663
at a time like this, didn't you?

279
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:54,165
No! Work!

280
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,459
I barely know how
to ride this thing.

281
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:58,420
How can I fix it?

282
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,672
There's no way.

283
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,800
Huh?

284
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:23,153
[shrieks]

285
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:31,286
[AISA]
Help! Help me, please! Help!

286
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,830
[horn trumpeting]

287
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,125
[AISA]
Don't eat me!

288
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,918
I don't want to die!

289
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,671
[horn trumpeting]

290
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,506
Please hurry, Father!

291
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,841
[PAGAYA]
I'm trying,

292
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:46,551
but I don't know if
we'll make it at this speed.

293
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,511
I'm about to gun it so hang on!

294
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:49,220
Right!

295
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:51,056
[SUU]
Suu Suu!

296
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:57,645
[AISA screams]

297
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,521
[PAGAYA]
Now, Conis!

298
00:19:58,605 --> 00:19:59,606
[CONIS]
Right!

299
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:02,525
Grab on! Reach out
and take my hand!

300
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,663
[PAGAYA]
That was a risky move.

301
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,582
Don't worry, you're safe now.

302
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:20,168
You're a Shandorian
child aren't you?

303
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,590
You don't have
to be afraid little girl.

304
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,883
We're friendly.

305
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,802
[AISA]
I'm not afraid!

306
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:31,221
I'm one of the
brave warriors of Shandora.

307
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:35,058
I'm not afraid of you Skypieans!

308
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:38,228
[SUU]
Suu Suu!

309
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,646
Her name is Suu.

310
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:43,358
And she seems
to like you quite a bit.

311
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,568
[SUU]
Suu!

312
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,489
You can call me Conis.

313
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,491
[PAGAYA]
I'm Pagaya, Conis's father.

314
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,159
Pleased to meet you little girl.

315
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:54,619
We're very glad
you're all right.

316
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,079
So, can you tell us your name?

317
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,997
Everyone calls me Aisa.

318
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,374
Look, I know you just saved me,

319
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,584
and I hate to ask
any more favors.

320
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:02,961
But I need to go
to the Upper Yard,

321
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:06,089
and I was wondering
if you would take me.

322
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:07,924
Because right now
there are all kinds

323
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:11,136
of people's voices
disappearing more and more.

324
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,554
It's the truth!

325
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:16,182
I can hear their voices,
even from very far away.

326
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,184
Then they're gone.

327
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,395
Actually, we're already
on our way to Upper Yard,

328
00:21:20,478 --> 00:21:22,105
so you can ride with us.

329
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:23,523
Yeah?

330
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:25,066
We're trying to find the pirates
from the Blue Sea World

331
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,235
because we thought we should
guide them safely out of Skypiea

332
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,154
and get them
where they need to go.

333
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,406
You mean all those
people on the ship?

334
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:32,741
Ah. Yes.

335
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,576
They're probably
still trying to escape

336
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,536
from the Upper Yard.

337
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,829
Do you know where
their ship could be?

338
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,914
It's very important.

339
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,249
[AISA]
Mm-hmm.

340
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:42,417
[CONIS]
Father!

341
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,793
[PAGAYA]
I understand.

342
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,838
All we need is for you
to lead us there, little one.

343
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,590
[AISA]
Sure.

344
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,597
[CHOPPER]
I'm finally a pirate!

345
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,432
I think instead of
looking for the others

346
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,184
I'll just look for the gold!

347
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,644
That would sure shock everybody!

348
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,441
That place over there
seems like a good spot

349
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,235
for gold to hide.

350
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,695
[CHOPPER]
Who knows.

351
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,281
Maybe the others
will end up there too.

352
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:29,839
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

353
00:22:29,923 --> 00:22:33,426
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

354
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,430
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

355
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:41,017
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

356
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:44,312
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

357
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,817
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

358
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,903
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

359
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:57,117
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

360
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,161
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

361
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

362
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:05,667
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

363
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,460
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

364
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:09,379
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

365
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:12,132
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

366
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,550
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

367
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,427
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

368
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,264
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

369
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,099
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

370
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:24,936
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

371
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,106
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

372
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:42,996
[LUFFY]
Aww!

373
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,289
I'm hungry!

374
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:46,416
There's gotta be something
to eat around here.

375
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,126
Or not.

376
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,210
[CONIS]
Are you all right?

377
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:51,254
You've been shaking
for a while now.

378
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,590
[AISA] I've never felt
this afraid before.

379
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,551
Everyone's voices
just keep disappearing.

380
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,386
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

381
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,265
"Unbeatable Powers!
Eneru's True Form is Revealed!"

382
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,809
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
