1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,393
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:18,193
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,994
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,180
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:30,682
[NARRATOR] With only one hour
left until Eneru's deadline,

25
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:35,228
time is quickly running out,
and only 24 survivors remain.

26
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,272
Cien Fleurs!

27
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,733
[YAMA]
Stop!

28
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:42,444
I'm afraid it's far
too late for that.

29
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,782
[NARRATOR] After finally
defeating the rotund Yama,

30
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:51,244
and discovering Shandora,
the fabled ancient city of gold.

31
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:55,415
Robin stumbled across
something even more astonishing.

32
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:57,792
[ROBIN]
Could it be?

33
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,755
[ROBIN] A Poneglyph was
carried into the city!

34
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:04,549
There's no question about it.

35
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,092
And that means,

36
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:10,138
the grand belfry located in
the center of the four altars.

37
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:13,224
It could contain the
text of true history.

38
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:17,020
It could be the Rio Poneglyph!

39
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,941
[LUFFY]
"0% Survival Rate!

40
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:25,278
Chopper vs. Ohm,
the Sword Wielding Priest!"

41
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,432
Almost there.

42
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,226
I can't wait to see the
look on all their faces

43
00:03:56,309 --> 00:04:00,313
when they find out
I discovered the gold first.

44
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,198
Look at those ruins.

45
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,082
[CHOPPER]
What's up with this place?

46
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,584
The ground's all crooked.

47
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,336
Guess I'll go this way.

48
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,928
Gold! Gold!

49
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,514
[growling]

50
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:37,392
[OHM]
No Holy. Stay.

51
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:39,269
I said stay!

52
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:50,280
[screams]

53
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,448
[CHOPPER]
What was I thinking?

54
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,575
I'm too little to do
this all by myself!

55
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,119
I should've gone back!

56
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,040
[OHM]
Interesting.

57
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:03,668
You're the third one
to make it this far today.

58
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,003
[CHOPPER]
Who are you?

59
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:06,838
[OHM]
I can't believe

60
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,674
that spider-headed fool
was so careless.

61
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:12,427
You killed Gedatsu, didn't you?

62
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,929
[CHOPPER] I guess he
means that guy from earlier.

63
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,059
[OHM]
I suppose it's for the best.

64
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:21,644
The world is better off
with one less imbecile.

65
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,271
Wouldn't you agree?

66
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,534
What the...? I tripped over...

67
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:43,500
[screams]

68
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,043
[OHM]
Calm yourself.

69
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:48,254
There's no need to be so afraid
of Holy, he's merely a pet.

70
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,255
He won't bite you.

71
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,507
[CHOPPER]
But what about this guy?

72
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,884
It looks like he's been
chewed up and spit out!

73
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,886
[OHM]
Heh. I assure you.

74
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,013
Holy is a very well-trained dog.

75
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,224
He would never bite anyone.

76
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,935
It was I who attacked that man.

77
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,144
Huh?!

78
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,396
Are you crazy?

79
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,647
Who are you?

80
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,023
Why would you
do something like that?

81
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,650
I am Sky Breeder Ohm.

82
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,319
Now would you please be quiet!

83
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,446
[OHM]
Do you think I'm not saddened

84
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,198
by what's taken place here?

85
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:17,283
Huh?

86
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,077
[OHM]
I don't understand.

87
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,246
Why do men choose to fight?

88
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:24,124
when they must know
how fragile their lives are?

89
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,875
I'm not really sure.

90
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,628
[OHM] Man was put here
to find happiness.

91
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:31,923
Yet time after time, they
throw themselves into battle,

92
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,633
only to lose their lives along

93
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,928
with the joy they've
struggled so hard to find.

94
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:41,808
What a strange and tragic
thing is man's nature!

95
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:44,811
There's only
one way to be redeemed!

96
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,564
And that is for all men to die!

97
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:48,982
Ah!

98
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:50,817
Oh, please, sir, you don't
really mean that, do you?

99
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,986
This is bad!

100
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,447
[OHM]
What have you come here for?

101
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,907
Oh. I was just trying
to find the city of gold!

102
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,868
[OHM]
Greed only leads to ruin!

103
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:00,910
Huh?

104
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:02,912
[OHM]
You must be rescued.

105
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:06,166
You wanna rescue... me?

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,088
Only losing your
life will save you

107
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:13,673
from all your earthly desires!

108
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:15,550
[CHOPPER gasps]

109
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:18,386
He doesn't want
to resuce me at all!

110
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,854
[LAKI]
But why?

111
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:32,150
[LAKI]
Why was everyone charred black?

112
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,944
It was almost as if they...

113
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,323
...they'd all been struck
by a bolt of lightning.

114
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:46,748
[LAKI]
Kamakiri! Kamakiri!

115
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:53,129
Ha... Ha...
Laki, is that you?

116
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:54,673
[LAKI]
Yes!

117
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:59,886
[KAMAKIRI]
Go. Get out of here, Laki!

118
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,514
Why? Tell me.

119
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:08,561
[KAMAKIRI] Wyper,
he's headed for god's shrine.

120
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,690
But Eneru isn't there!

121
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:14,901
There's still time Laki.

122
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,362
Stop Wyper.

123
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,613
All right.

124
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,990
I understand.
Now quiet, save your strength.

125
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,664
Nobody can beat Eneru.

126
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:31,126
[ENERU]
I am living lightning.

127
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:34,504
[laughs]

128
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,259
Laki.

129
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,802
Hear me!

130
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:44,639
[KAMAKIRI]
He comes as lightning.

131
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:47,392
An element that man has
feared from the beginning

132
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,436
and rightly so.

133
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,522
He can't be conquered.

134
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,733
[LAKI]
Don't worry, I'll stop Wyper.

135
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:57,152
You just wait here
and save your energy.

136
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,529
I'm going to leave
Aisa's bag with you.

137
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,210
[KAMAKIRI]
Nobody can beat Eneru.

138
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:16,796
He can't be conquered.

139
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,469
[LAKI] Kamakiri is so strong,
yet his will has been broken.

140
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,887
If what he said is true,

141
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,389
then Eneru's eaten
a Logia-type Devil Fruit.

142
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,516
The most powerful kind of all!

143
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,478
I've got to stop Wyper
before its too late!

144
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:36,608
[ZORO]
Hmm...

145
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,026
I've been here.

146
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,820
It looks familiar.

147
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:43,156
Or have I?

148
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,240
Maybe.

149
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,451
Or maybe not.

150
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:49,537
Huh. I'm not sure.

151
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,125
[GIANT SOUTHBIRD]
Pfft.

152
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,378
Are you laughing at me, huh?

153
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,505
[squawks]

154
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:00,131
What are you so
worked up for anyway?

155
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:01,925
The only reason you came
along in the first place

156
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,134
is to get some food.

157
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:05,679
My bad sense of
direction shouldn't matter!

158
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,097
Ya dummy!

159
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:13,269
[ZORO]
Huh?

160
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:14,270
Aah!

161
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:15,480
No! No! No!

162
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:16,523
Hey!

163
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:18,441
Let go, you big
featherbrained jerk.

164
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,235
There's no more food in there.

165
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,237
Hey!

166
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,989
Where are you taking us?

167
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:30,161
[LUFFY] Of all the
weird places to end up.

168
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:34,457
Exit, exit, where is the exit?

169
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,959
Here it is!

170
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:37,961
Ooo. Huh?

171
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,464
[LUFFY]
It's a dead end.

172
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,800
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

173
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,593
Huh?

174
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:49,889
You can't be serious;
I walked all this way.

175
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,516
Maybe...

176
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,477
Maybe it's a trick door.

177
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,438
Let's find out.

178
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:00,025
I can always try busting
through the stupid thing.

179
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:02,235
Gum-gum...

180
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:04,237
...Bazooka!

181
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:12,078
But it... it didn't even budge.

182
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:18,752
[rumbling]

183
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,671
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

184
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:24,507
Huh? Huh?!

185
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,009
[screams]

186
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,304
Not again!

187
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,066
[CHOPPER screaming]

188
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:07,092
[CHOPPER panting]

189
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,019
He didn't follow me.

190
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,063
I'm okay.

191
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,782
I bet he's a Priest too,

192
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:33,451
but it looks like there's a lot
of places to hide around here.

193
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,578
If I can just stay hidden
long enough to escape,

194
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:38,123
I can try to meet up
with the others.

195
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,293
I have to make sure
he doesn't see me.

196
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,461
He looked like a swordsman,

197
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:46,548
so if I keep my distance
I should be okay.

198
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:51,011
[OHM]
He's run quite a long way.

199
00:12:51,094 --> 00:12:54,556
But running from
salvation is futile.

200
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,978
Attachment to this life
is a result of evil desires.

201
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:02,397
Therefore...

202
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,001
...the path to peace,
leads to but one place.

203
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:24,627
This is the Ordeal of Iron!

204
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:27,172
The survival rate is zero!

205
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,611
[AISA]
Another voice disappeared!

206
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,528
[NAMI]
Aisa?

207
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:51,237
[AISA]
I can't just sit here!

208
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,822
I've gotta go find Laki!

209
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:54,449
[NAMI]
Oh, no, you don't!

210
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,369
Wait! Aisa!

211
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,537
[NAMI groans]

212
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,999
Get back here!

213
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,958
Leave me alone!

214
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:05,752
I've got to save Laki! Let go!

215
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,420
I've gotta get out
of here right now!

216
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:08,296
Let go!

217
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,006
This isn't any of your business!

218
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,716
Maybe it's not
any of my business,

219
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,051
but there's no way
I'm gonna sit back

220
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,969
and let a little kid
get herself killed!

221
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:16,262
I'm a warrior!

222
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:17,430
Yeah, yeah, I know.

223
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,057
Kid warrior.

224
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,310
Hey! Those dirty looks don't
scare me, so knock it off.

225
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,238
Nami? Is everything okay?

226
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:34,614
[NAMI]
We're fine.

227
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,866
All right, stop messing
around and get in the waver!

228
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:39,703
You don't understand!

229
00:14:39,786 --> 00:14:41,621
You have to let me go,
so I can save my friends!

230
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,164
I have to help them!

231
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:45,542
You better knock it off right
now, or I'm gonna slug you!

232
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,585
[NAMI]
And no crying!

233
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,297
Look, you don't want to end up
like Sanji and Usopp do you?

234
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,216
Well do you?

235
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,889
Come on, I'll help
you in the boat.

236
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,192
[screams]

237
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:22,704
Oh no!

238
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,126
[LUFFY coughs]

239
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,962
Okay. That was scary.

240
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,340
What's with this
lame cave anyhow?

241
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:38,887
First there was an earthquake,
then a flood of ocean clouds!

242
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,638
I could've drowned!

243
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:41,723
You hear me?

244
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,725
Open up!

245
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:46,061

247
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:49,773
Why's it going crazy?

[LUFFY roars]

249
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,276
Let me out of here!

Nami, no!

254
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,753
That way leads to the forest!

255
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,880
[NAMI screams]

256
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,965

00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,550
[PAGAYA moans]

258
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,760
[CONIS]
What do we do?

259
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:21,054
They've gone into the forest!

260
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,769
Missed.

261
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,270
Ha!

262
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,855
You're lucky.

263
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:43,535
[distant rumble]

264
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:44,703
Huh?

265
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,830
[DIVINE SQUAD MEMBER]
Hmm? What's that?

266
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,333
Who's that?

267
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:51,209
I dunno.

268
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,919
Something's coming!

269
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,758
Go that way!

270
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,720
That way!

Aisa!

Aww.

be giant snake food!

faster you dumb bird?

It's still coming after us!

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,920

really pissed it off!

[screams]

292
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,206
To make it to god's shrine,

293
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,835
I have to climb to
the top of Giant Jack.

294
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,713
And if Eneru is there.

295
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:02,966
It's time I brought an end
to our terrible history,

296
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,884
once and for all!

297
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,722
Now.

299
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,154
If you climb that
vine any further,

300
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:27,490
you'll reach god's shrine.

301
00:19:27,574 --> 00:19:31,369
What makes you think you
have permission to pass?

302
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:34,539
[WYPER growls]
Damn you.

303
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,001
It doesn't matter.

304
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:41,629
Heading for that shrine
is no longer useful.

[WYPER]

306
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,428
What business do you have here?

307
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,556
Still can't let go
of your old position?

308
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,351
[GAN FALL] No, but I still
have responsibilities

309
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,102
I've yet to fulfill.

310
00:19:56,186 --> 00:19:58,480
I thought you might be
interested in knowing

311
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:01,983
I've recently come
from god's shrine.

312
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:09,949
It's tragic, the entire thing's
been utterly destroyed.

313
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,248
Naturally.

314
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,918
Eneru was nowhere to be found.

315
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,174
Perhaps it means he no
longer has any need for it.

316
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:31,137
[ENERU] It appears that their
years of hard labor are over.

317
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:34,766
You see, this island is
no longer useful to me.

318
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,769
I've simply come
to bid you farewell.

319
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:43,149
I demand to know, Ohm!

320
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,444
What is it you and
your master seek to do?

321
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:47,445
Hold on.

322
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,115

00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,279
Hmm.

look pretty tough.

Oh well. Hey!

00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:35,577

[OHM]
Look what we have here.

335
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:41,332
If it isn't another greedy
infidel, seeking his salvation.

336
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,751
[WYPER]
Enough!

337
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,545
Get out of my way, or I'll
destroy every one of you!

The time has come, Ohm.

339
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:51,384
Tell me where Eneru
and the Divine Squad are!

00:21:54,054 --> 00:21:55,096
Ya stupid cave!

00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,265
Just let me out!

I'm sure you each feel

343
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,488
what you have
to say is important,

344
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:14,199
but there's only one way
for your voice to be heard.

345
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:17,577
You must survive
or find salvation!
