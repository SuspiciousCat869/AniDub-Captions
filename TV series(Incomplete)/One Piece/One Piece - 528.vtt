WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.871
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.008
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.643
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.079
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.487
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.756
[NARRATOR] Now, those
who dare to dream hoist

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.426
their flags and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.324
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.194
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:46.466
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.635
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.370
to ever chart these
waters and learn

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.205
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.140
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.643
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.212
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.216
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey
D. Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.518
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:09.189
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:13.426
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:16.996
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.365
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.334
Scattered across the world,
Luffy and his crew

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.504
underwent special training
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.906
Now, after taming the
terrors of the deep,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.542
they have finally made
their way to Fishman Island,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.445
thousands of feet
below sea level.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.480
Listen up, guys!

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.887
Let's go!

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.125
How about I give you an option?

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.027
Enlist under our
banner as members

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.697
of the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.435
or else! "Or else" meaning
we sink you right now.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:59.439
Yeah right, you wish! Stupid!

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:04.010
[FRANKY]
Here goes. Coup de Burst!

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.081
This bubble. It's
a double structure!

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.550
We're about to run
into another bubble!

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.386
You guys ready?

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.754
Water?

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.629
[NAMI]
This current is really strong!

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.333
[CHOPPER]
Help... me...

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.969
[BROOK]
Can't breathe.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.839
[SANJI]
Crap. Four of us can't swim.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:43.316
[ZORO]
Come on. Reach!

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:47.153
[SANJI]
Nami! Robin!

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.792
[SANJI] Dammit. I can't
resist the current!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.304
Where am I?

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:05.605
[CAMIE]
Oh, Luffy- <i>chin</i> !

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.273
[gasps]

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:11.210
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.379
[CAMIE] This is a coral
apartment complex.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.882
The dorms are at the very
bottom, so rent's cheap.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.483
The top floor's
the most expensive

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:18.985
because it gets natural light.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:22.622
It's the surface! We made it!

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.657
Hey! Camie!

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.093
[gasps] Hey, guys!

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.031
Finally!

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.601
I found my All Blue
after all these years!

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.239
[HORDY]
Interesting.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:44.143
So, Straw Hat finally made
it to our turf, did he?

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.144
Good for him.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.947
[HAMMOND] Wh-What are we
gonna do about it, Boss?

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:55.021
I want you to bring
him here and quickly.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:02.595
[LUFFY] "Excitement Blow-out!
Sanji's Life Under Threat!"

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.005
[hiccups] The Straw
Hats are human.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.674
They can't breathe down here.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.275
Assuming they're still alive,

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.511
there aren't many
places they can go.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.446
Guess we should
head for town, huh?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.282
Wherever they are,
they can't hide for long.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.557
[NAMI grunts]

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.366
Well, great.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.302
Okay, now what should I do?

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:46.339
It's hard to believe
I'm so far underwater.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:52.979
Huh?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.924
[screams]

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:12.165
Super...

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:16.502
...landing. Hey, Nami! Whew!
Glad you made it out okay!

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:18.571
Yeah? No thanks to you!

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:22.308
You almost gave me a
heart attack, you big dummy!

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.943
Robin!

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:28.247
[NAMI]
Robin. Hey!

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.916
Nami?

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.584
[NAMI]
You all right?

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.086
[ROBIN]
Is this Fishman Island?

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.321
[NAMI]
Yeah, probably.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.924
Franky's scouting out the
area to figure that out.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.793
[FRANKY]
Hm? Back in the land of living?

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.629
[ROBIN]
So, it seems.

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:44.831
Find anyone else?

00:07:44.864 --> 00:07:45.998
Nope.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:47.867
Looks like we were all thrown
in different directions.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.103
[sighs] Jeez. And we just got
back together again, too.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.306
[FRANKY] Eh. We'll find
'em sooner or later.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:54.607
They're tough suckers,
so I'm sure

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.342
they're doin' fine,
wherever they are.

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.511
[ROBIN chuckles]
He does have a point.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.779
No offense to the crew,

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:01.614
but I'm more worried
about the Sunny.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:02.882
I'm hopin' the locals
might have heard

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.817
some news about our big crash.

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.786
I saw a town right
around the corner.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.857
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.728
[laughs]

00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:17.063
[GROUP]
Sanji!

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:19.398
All right, here I come!

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.834
[MERMAIDS giggle]

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.469
This is it.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:29.542
[SANJI]
This is my new home!

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:35.615
He isn't spewing
blood everywhere,

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:38.618
so I guess he's better now.
I don't get it.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.753
This sucks. I wanna swim, too.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.422
You can. All we have to do
is get you a bubble.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.457
Whoa, really?

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.759
Uh-huh! We can have
one made in the city.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:47.426
Sound good?

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.094
Yeah!

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.662
This's a lucky break.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.330
If he had a nosebleed now,

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.533
we wouldn't be able
to do a transfusion.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.002
Sanji's blood type is
rare and we're all out.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:58.771
What? That sounds like
seriously bad news.

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.273
Hey, Camie?

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.541
Huh?

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:02.808
While I'm here,
there's somebody

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.645
I'd really like to see,
if we can find them somehow.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.447
Oh? Don't tell me,
the Mermaid Princess?

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.382
[LUFFY]
Nope.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:12.318
Heh. It's Jimbei!

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.955
[CAMIE]
They call him "Boss" down here.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.490
Wait, when you say "Jimbei,"

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:20.059
you're talking about
the Warlord, Jimbei?

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.460
Or, I mean, "former Warlord,"

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.296
since he resigned after
the whole war-thing.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.131
[LUFFY] Yeah, he's a
good friend of mine.

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:28.000
Huh?! Him <i>and</i> the
Pirate Empress?

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.403
You make some weird friends
when we're not around!

00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:32.038
[LUFFY]
When Ace died two years ago,

00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.206
I had a tough time
pullin' it together.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.642
In fact, I doubt I'd
even be here right now

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.377
if it wasn't for his help.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.846
[JIMBEI] I've had
enough of your nonsense!

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:43.849
[grunts]

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.821
Boy, you can't see
a thing. You're blind.

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:50.923
What's gone may be gone,

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.593
but you still have something
left in this world to treasure.

00:09:53.626 --> 00:09:55.394
Don't you?!

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.202
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:09.175
I still have my crew!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.777
Can't wait to talk to him again!

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.413
See you on Fishman
Island in two years!

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.016
Be sure to bring your
entire crew along.

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.719
I look forward to
meeting everyone!

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.587
He said to meet here,
and there's no way

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.422
I'm gonna let him down!

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.024
Now that you mention it,
I heard he went

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.093
to Marineford with you
when you rang that bell

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.628
and everyone got all worked up.

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.296
Ya-hoo!

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:34.266
[MERMAIDS laughing]

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.801
You know where
we can find him?

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.903
Well, it's kinda tricky,
'cause Boss doesn't

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:40.606
exactly live on the island
with everyone else.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.607
Huh?

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.275
Since he resigned
from the Warlords,

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.811
they have to treat him
like a normal pirate again.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.780
That means all the
Fishman Pirates can't stay

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.316
in the city anymore, so they
found a new place to live.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:52.084
It's not too far from
here, but that's where

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.719
you'll have to go if
you want to see him.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:54.887
What?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.423
That sounds like a pain.
This place has some dumb rules!

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.258
[CAMIE] I know it seems
weird, but even though

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.726
we're all the way down here,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.729
the War of the Best
ended up affecting us, too.

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:04.430
Camie!

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:07.266
[GROUP]
Camie!

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.734
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:10.403
--There's a big ship coming!
--[NIKA] Maybe.

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.771
It's a ship from the palace!

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.239
Yeah, but maybe nobody's on it.

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.408
Don't be stupid,
of course someone is.

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.777
So did you see somebody
on the ship or not?

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.911
[ICHIKA]
No. Not yet.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:20.746
But it was for sure
the royal family's ship.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.748
They don't usually
come around here.

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.684
Maybe they've come
here to arrest Luffy

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.652
'cause he didn't enter
the city the right way!

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.287
So what if they do?

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.923
You guys had better hide
before they get here!

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.091
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Huh?

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.693
Sanji, quick. This way!

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.628

Huh.

[CAMIE]
It's not fair.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.171
I'd do anything in the
world to save his life,

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.740
but I don't have
the right blood type.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.276
No, it's nothing for
you to feel bad about.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:18.510
If he wasn't such a perv,

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:20.712
this wouldn't have happened
in the first place.

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:21.780
Look at him.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:24.016
He's dying and he's still
thinking about boobs.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.784
[SANJI]
...so bouncy.

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:28.220
So soft and bouncy and...

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.455
Stop! You're in
a delicate state!

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.291
If you keep thinking
about dirty stuff,

you're gonna lose what
little blood you have left!

[sighs] We may be friends,
but considering the way

you and Hachi got
treated back on Sabaody,

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:43.035
I should've guessed something
like this would happen.

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.704
There's some deep-rooted
stuff going on here.

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:48.807
Yeah. And to be honest,
I dunno how this'll go.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.476
There's no promise anyone'll
help us back in town.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.878
Huh?

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.913
We're counting on
human donors for blood,

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.549
but I haven't seen any
at all this past month.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.051
In fact, your ship
is the first one

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.652
we've had in a long time.

[LUFFY]
Why? I thought everyone

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:03.221
had to come through here.

00:22:03.255 --> 00:22:05.657
[CAMIE] Yeah, it wasn't
like this before.

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.826
Nobody can say for
certain, but we think

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.394
someone's attacking
the travelers,

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.063
like what happened
with you guys.

There's something going
on in this kingdom,

and I have a sinking feeling
it's about to get ugly.

00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:21.940
[FUKABOSHI] Please, ladies,
you must be forthright.

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:25.043
Why did you try to conceal
those pirates from us?

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.580
We're sorry, Prince.
They aren't bad people.

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:31.083
It sounds like what happened
wasn't their fault.

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:32.918
They're Camie's friends,
and they got split up

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.486
from their crew,
so we didn't want them

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.588
to be thrown in jail
as soon as they got here.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:39.758
[ISHILLY sighs] I hope they
find a donor for Sanji.

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.760
Alas, you misunderstood us.

Their method of entry
is no concern.

They're quite famous.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.332
It would only be
a small formality.

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:50.001
We don't consider them
enemies, after all.

Yeah, we had different business
with them ♪ re-mi-fa-so-la-ti!

to pass on to them.

From Jimbei.

[NARRATOR] Sanji's love for
mermaids has turned

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:18.196
from a harmless obsession into
a life-threatening disaster.

Luffy and his friends take him
to the mermaid café to rest,

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:23.502
but they must find
a blood donor soon.

Later, Camie introduces
them to Madame Sharley,

owner of the café and
expert fortune teller.
