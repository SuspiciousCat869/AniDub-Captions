00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,631
[NAMI]
Look closely. Usopp was right.

103
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,035
It is a map, and it marks
the location of Lost Island.

104
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,871
Do you see that island with
the dome‐shaped building on it?

105
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,806
Well, that's this island.

106
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,809
And that dome is the building
we're inside now.

107
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,977
They do look the same.

108
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,180
[NAMI] And those figures,
they must represent people.

109
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,682
I'll bet anything that
they're the ones

110
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,817
who used to inhabit
this island long ago.

111
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,020
And if that's the case, they're
probably Apis' ancestors.

112
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,855
Ancestors?

113
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,591
Don't you remember the story
old man Bokuden told us?

114
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,026
[LUFFY]
Nope! I was asleep!

115
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,529
He said the people
of Warship Island

116
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,763
were the descendants
of the people

117
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,732
who came from Lost Island.

118
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,866
Oh, did he?

119
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,903
Come to think of it, that
does sound kinda familiar.

120
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,838
Then does that mean
that dynasty of kings

121
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,841
he kept babbling on and on
about was on this island?

122
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,109
Probably.

123
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,512
What got me wondering were the
dragon statues and iconography

124
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,581
we saw all over the island.

125
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,083
There was so much.

126
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,552
That seems to indicate that
the people who lived here

127
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,688
probably worshipped the
Millennial Dragons as gods.

128
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,458
I bet they made those icons
in the image of the dragons

129
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,027
that used to fly over
this island long ago.

130
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,195
I see.

131
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,363
Well if that's true,

132
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,064
then that would lower the
chance of the Dragons' Nest

133
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,599
being on this island.

134
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,869
Then where could the real
Dragons' Nest be?

135
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,972
Wouldn't it be on the island
with the dragon drawn on it?

136
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,207
[BOTH]
Huh?

137
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,976
[NAMI] You're right! Look!
Where those people are praying?

138
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,878
Just ahead of them
is another island,

139
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,613
and there's a dragon image!

140
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:25,051
That's the real Lost Island!
The Dragons' Nest must be there!

141
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,719
But‐‐

142
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,489
Wait a minute! That can't be!
That island's shape!

143
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,556
Yeah.

144
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,892
I know, but if that map
on the ceiling is correct,

145
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,794
then the only place the
Dragons' Nest can be

146
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,562
is on Warship Island.

147
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,563
[USOPP]
Wait a minute!

148
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,265
If the Dragons' Nest
is on Warship Island,

149
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,933
wouldn't it have been
found already?

150
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,170
Well that's what the map says!
It's as plain as day!

151
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,140
What, do you think I just
made that up or something?!

152
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,108
[SANJI] Come on, guys,
Nami's a navigator.

153
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,077
If anyone can read
a map, it's her.

154
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,913
This means the Dragons' Nest
is somewhere on Warship Island.

155
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,582
If we look hard enough,
we'll find it.

156
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,951
Huh. Maybe, but there's
always the chance

157
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,920
that it sank to the
bottom of the ocean.

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,256
In fact, if that map's correct,

159
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,124
I'd say that's likely
what happened.

160
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,693
It would also explain why no
one has ever found the nest

161
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,862
after all these years.

162
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,431

this place, but it's not!

is an old painting!

00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,210
Does it bring back any
memories to you at all?

168
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,780
The only hope we have left
is that you remember!

really is on Warship Island.

[APIS] Uh? How did you
know what he said, Luffy?

174
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,247
Don't know, just do.

175
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,051
You're right. Grandpa Ryu
said he just remembered.

176
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,820
He says the Dragons' Nest
is located on an island

177
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,290
east of a peak that looks
just like a warship.

178
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,391
Perfect.

179
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,392
Why couldn't he have
remembered that

180
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,161
before we risked our lives
to get here, huh?

181
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,230
[APIS]
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,432
I'm sorry for dragging you
all the way out here,

183
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,734
and for something that
probably has already sank

184
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,403
to the bottom of the ocean.

185
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,239
It was all for nothing.

186
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,440
[USOPP sighs]

187
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,908
[USOPP]
Not necessarily.

188
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:36,909
Uh, huh?

189
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,678
[USOPP] Who knows?
The Dragons' Nest could be

190
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,314
someplace else on
Warship Island!

191
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,984
But we won't know unless
we look for it, right?

192
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,352
[NAMI]
He's right.

193
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,422
Besides, giving up so
easily isn't like you, Apis.

194
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,856
[SANJI]
If you fall down in life,

195
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,858
you just have to get
right back up.

196
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:57,196
Yeah, you shouldn't ever
give up hope, kid.

197
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,831
I...

198
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,200
[chuckles]

199
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,435
Let's go!

200
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,705
I mean, you do want Grandpa Ryu
to get better, don't you?

201
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,708
[APIS]
Mh‐hm!

202
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,810
[USOPP, APIS, NAMI chuckle]

203
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,777
[APIS]
Thank you!

204
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,723
Zoro, what's wrong?

205
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,724
[ZORO]
Someone's here.

206
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,992
[USOPP]
Huh?

207
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,460
[ZORO]
Up there.

208
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,197
[chuckling]

209
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,200
[ERIC] Thank you for deciphering
the intricacies of that map.

210
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,334
Well done.

211
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,571
Now I can find the Dragonite
and their nest as well.

212
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,506
It's the sicko!

213
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,209
[ERIC] But there's no point if
it's at the bottom of the ocean.

214
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,744
It looks like my only option now

215
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,146
is to take your
Millennial Dragon.

216
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,080
No way!

217
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,016
We don't even know if
the nest really sank

218
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,685
so stay away from him, you jerk!

219
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,020
You better let us handle him.

220
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,656
He's got Sickle Sickle
Fruit powers.

221
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,524
This is one nasty guy
we've got here.

222
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,992
Sickle Sickle? Him?

223
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,828
He's got Devil Fruit
powers, too?!

224
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,729
Hey.

225
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,231
[ZORO]
Luffy.

226
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,934
You guys go on ahead and
get Grandpa Ryu to the ship.

227
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,772
I'll catch up with you later.

228
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,706
[LUFFY]
Heh.

229
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,074
Gotcha!

230
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,778
Whoa! Hold on! Wait a minute!
Get to the ship? How?!

231
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,513
I don't see an exit
here, do you?!

232
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,882
[LUFFY]
Then I guess I'll... make one!

233
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,883
[USOPP]
Huh?

234
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,217
Luffy! Wait!

235
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,961
[LUFFY]
It didn't break. Huh...

236
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,798
Maybe I should have thought
that through before doing it.

237
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,901
[ALL]
Really? You think so?

238
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,919
[chuckles] There's our exit!

239
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,723
See! We worked it out somehow!
Come on, Apis, let's go!

240
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,791
He's hard‐headed,
but this is ridiculous!

241
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,159
No, you don't!

242
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,901
[clanging]

243
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,603
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

244
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,779
Dammit, Luffy!

245
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,948
Would you quit gawking and
get outta here already?!

246
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,783
[LUFFY]
Oh! My bad!

247
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,960
[LUFFY]
Woohoo!

248
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,663
‐‐[APIS, NAMI screaming]
‐‐[LUFFY laughs]

249
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,638
Yeah! This is fun!

250
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,680
We usually make it out alive
from things like this, right?!

251
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah, but I hope our luck
hasn't finally run out!

252
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,186
We'll be back to the
ship in no time!

253
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:10,189
[screaming]

254
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,304
Move! Or you won't
live to regret it!

255
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,539
Hah!

256
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,308
I'm not movin' so you're gonna
have to make me, swirly head!

257
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,077
[growls]

258
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,006
[USOPP] Well, guys, I guess we
should look on the bright side!

259
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,175
I'm pretty confident that
I can say we are now

260
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,711
the fastest moving
things in this world!

261
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,047
At this speed,
we won't live to tell it!

262
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,049
Luffy! Do something! Now!

263
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,384
If we don't slow down,
we'll wind up in pieces!

264
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,353
Don't worry! We're okay!

265
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,956
[NAMI]
How are we okay?!

266
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,626
[ERIC]
Sickle‐Sickle Wind Slash!

267
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,063
What was that?!

268
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,397
Hey! I'm not done with you!

269
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,234
[ERIC] Hmph! I have no
more time to waste on you.

270
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,768
There's a Millennial
Dragon out there

271
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,071
that needs my
undivided attention.

272
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,241
[ZORO]
Agh! You get back here!

273
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,421
[ZORO] I hope the others
made it through this.

274
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,127
Hey! Will Zoro be
okay back there?!

275
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,929
[LUFFY]
Yeah! He'll be fine!

276
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,298
[APIS] But he's up against
someone with Devil Fruit powers!

277
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,134
I don't care how strong
he is, he's in danger!

278
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,004
[LUFFY]
He'll be all right! Trust me!

279
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,443
Luffy! Up ahead!

280
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,479
Yeah. That doesn't
look good, huh?

281
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,281
Well don't just stand there!

282
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,082
Do something!

283
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,487
[ALL screaming]

284
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,958
[LUFFY laughing]

285
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,199
There they are. Hm?

286
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,872
Sorry, pal, but I'm not gonna
let you go any further.

287
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:46,045
That so? Well, I come and
go as I please, swordsman!

288
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,446
Move it!

289
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,825
Damn, that guy's nimble!

290
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,915
[yells]

291
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,325
I said I wouldn't let you pass.

292
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,260
Now don't move an inch!

293
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,872
Look! We're headed right
for the city's walls!

294
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:47,906
[LUFFY]
Let's bust through!

295
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,208
[NAMI]
No!

296
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,544
Behind those walls is the cliff
we followed on our way up here!

297
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,179
If we crash through those walls,

298
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,448
we'll shoot over the cliff
and fall to our doom!

299
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,917
There won't be anything left!

300
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,219
We could fly.

301
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,254
You moron!

302
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,083
[ERIC] I told you that you
wouldn't live to regret it.

303
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,386
And now the cost is...
your life!

304
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,260
I don't believe it.
We're all still alive.

305
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,962
And we somehow manage to hang
onto this cart the whole time

306
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,098
without being thrown off.

307
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,903
I told ya we'd make it!

308
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,272
Well quit layin'
around! We gotta go!

309
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,473
Oh, please.

310
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,941
He's dead.

311
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,944
[USOPP] Not if I get
my hands on 'em first!

312
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,588
[APIS]
Luffy!

313
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,958
The birds said Zoro's
in big trouble!

314
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,528
What do we do?!
We've gotta help him!

315
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,464
[ERIC]
Now die!

316
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:29,308
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

317
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,511
Bingo!

318
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,213
So cool.

319
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,449
No. Not this. Not again.

320
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,651
[chuckles]

321
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,686
‐‐[ZORO] Argh! Luffy!
‐‐[LUFFY] Hang on!

322
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,556
[ZORO] I told you to stop
doing this, you idiot!

323
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,325
[LUFFY]
Oops, sorry.

324
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,459
[ZORO]
If you ever do that again,

325
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,962
I'll chop you into pieces.

326
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,964
Damn.

327
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,367
I can't let them escape again!

328
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,244
[LUFFY]
Hey, look! We're out!

329
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,679
[SANJI]
This mirage still weirds me out.

330
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,314
What?! They're back?!

331
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,516
Yes!

332
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,351
They appear to be headed in
the direction of Warship Island,

333
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,086
and they're still
towing that dragon!

334
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,188
[LT. COMMANDER] All ships are
to pursue them immediately!

335
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,223
Send the order! On the double!

336
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,026
[MARINE A]
Yes, Sir! Oh, by the way, Sir.

337
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,261
Eric just reappeared as well.

338
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,364
We'll have to wait for him to
reboard before we go after them.

339
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,168
Him. That useless prima donna.

340
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,203
I should've put a hole
in the boat he took.

341
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,204
Sir?

342
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,706
It's nothing! Send that order.

343
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,077
Well, you actually made it
back to the ship unharmed.

344
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,046
And also empty‐handed
it appears.

345
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,714
[growls]

346
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:43,549
[ERIC]
Hmph!

347
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,284
Shouldn't you be
catching those pirates

348
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,420
instead of making sarcastic
remarks, Commander?

349
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,127
[USOPP]
Woohoo! Eat our sails!

350
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:59,398
You'll never catch us, ya bunch
of lollygaggin' slow‐pokes!

351
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,733
The Going Merry is faster
and more agile

352
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,302
than those bulky Marine ships,

353
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,103
but once we stop
at Warship Island,

354
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,605
they're going to catch up.

355
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,473
Guys, what are we
gonna do then?

356
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,142
Do we even have a plan?

357
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:10,809
We'll be okay!

358
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,377
Oh, yeah?! How?!

359
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,479
All we have to do is
find the Dragons' Nest,

360
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,749
and then Grandpa Ryu will
get better and help us out!

361
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,751
[SANJI] That's easier said
than done, Luffy.

362
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,487
The nest could be at the bottom
of the ocean for all we know.

363
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,489
[LUFFY] We'll search the
bottom of the ocean then!

364
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,325
[ZORO] Big talk for
someone who can't swim.

365
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,427
[NAMI] Let's just get
back to Warship Island.

366
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,229
We'll work this out
and hopefully avoid

367
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,265
any entanglements
with the Marines.

368
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,501
Uh, Nami? I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

369
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,170
[ALL gasp]

370
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:50,816
Oh cool! Look at that!
It's a gargoyle!

371
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,184
What?!

372
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,589
[chuckles]

373
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,359
The small fries have
leapt forth! Good!

374
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,460
Now is the time!

375
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,596
All ships, take up positions
to the left and right!

376
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,798
Crane Wing Formation!

377
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,376
[ALL yelp]

378
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,944
You've gotta be kidding me!

379
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,679
What, did the Marines
bring every ship

380
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,547
in their whole damn
fleet after us?

381
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,949
[NELSON]
All ships!

382
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,185
Connect to your fellow vessels
with the chain links!

383
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,189
No vessel, large or small,
can break through our wall!

384
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,626
Those small fries have just
walked into the frying pan!

385
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,329
What do we do?!
They have us blocked off!

386
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,563
We jump onto those ships,

387
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,866
fight off the Marines,
and cut those links!

388
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,967
It's our only choice!

389
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,671
Wow! You mean you're really
gonna do that, Usopp?

390
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,672
[USOPP]
Uhh...

391
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,907
Go! Zoro! Luffy! Sanji!

392
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,410
Why am I not surprised?

393
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,345
Actually, it's not a bad idea.

394
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,480
What? Are you serious?

395
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,384
Even if you tried that,
there's no way you'd survive!

396
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,987
It's okay, Apis.
Things'll work out.

397
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,424
Just promise me that you'll make
this raid quick, okay, guys?

398
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,825
With all my heart.

399
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,561
[LUFFY]
All right! Let's go!

400
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,665
All ships, take aim now.
Target the pirate ship.

401
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,567
Do not hit the raft
behind the ship.

402
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,270
If it's even slightly damaged,
you'll answer to me.

403
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,905
Open fire!

404
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,778
[ERIC]
Stop here.

405
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,449
All ships, full stop!

406
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:36,955
[ERIC]
Nelson.

407
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,690
I had you pegged as a glutton

408
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,460
whose only expertise
was in eating.

409
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,462
But seeing this plan
of yours set in motion

410
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,797
has changed my mind.

411
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,267
Now I know how a tub
of guts such as yourself

412
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,803
achieved the rank of Commodore.

413
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,608
[laughs]

414
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,245
This is fun! Bring it on!

415
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,752
<i>♪All that's in my</i>

416
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,887

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,922

418
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,825

423
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:33,645

[USOPP] Do you really think
we can break through

437
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,525
this huge blockade?!

438
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,727
[NAMI] We have to,
or Grandpa Ryu's doomed!

439
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,462
[ZORO]
Let's go!

440
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,329
[SANJI]
It's not gonna be easy

441
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,031
with all those cannons
shooting at us!

442
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,865
Watch out!

443
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,834
[LUFFY]
Hey, Zoro! Cut those chains!

444
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,669
[ZORO] I'm going as
fast as I can, Luffy!

445
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,371
[NAMI] Guys, we don't have much
time left! You've gotta hurry!

446
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,006
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

447
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,075
"Luffy, Completely Surrounded!

00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,578
Commodore Nelson's
Secret Strategy."

449
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,013
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
