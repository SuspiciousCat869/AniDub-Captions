00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,168
[VIVI]
Leader.

175
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,606
I don't know what to say to him.

176
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,873
To any of them.

177
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,711
[COBRA] We all feel regret
over what has happened,

178
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,879
but that's natural.

179
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,483
[MAN A]
King Cobra.

180
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,884
[MAN B]
Your Majesty.

181
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,787
[COBRA] We've lost so much,
and gained nothing.

182
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,955
We've been divided.

183
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,462
[COBRA] But now we have a
chance to take a step forward!

184
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,796
No matter who
you fought against,

185
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,632
the battle did occur
and it's over.

186
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,468
We must put this strife
behind us and become one again.

187
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,206
The king's right.

188
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,009
[COBRA] Unfortunately,
there's nothing we can do

189
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,811
about what's happened.
We cannot change the past.

190
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,817
There's one thing
we can change, however,

191
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,486
and that's our future!

192
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,655
[ALL gasp]

193
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,664
He's so wise.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,904
[COBRA] A future where all of
Alabasta is united once more!

195
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,507
[SOLDIERS chattering]

196
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,709
[NARRATOR] The monumental
battle that will be engraved

197
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,778
upon the annals of history.

198
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,714
[SOLDIERS chattering]

199
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,059
[NARRATOR]
And even more importantly,

200
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,261
the battle that
will never be told...

201
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,701
...is finally over.

202
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,788
[HINA]
Smoker!

203
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,124
Where the hell is
this rain coming from?

204
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,928
Don't tell me you used the
Dance Powder on this ship!

205
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,097
Don't be stupid.

206
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,600
Believe it or not, I know better
than to commit a crime.

207
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,302
We haven't seen each
other in quite some time,

208
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,104
and the first thing
you do is blame me

209
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,772
for some natural rain?

210
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,374
And I was about to
tell you you look good.

211
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,275
[HINA]
You're right.

212
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,612
It was a lousy welcome.
Hina's sorry.

213
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,380
As for the compliment,
I can't believe

214
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,117
the "White Hunter" would
say something so sweet.

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,053
My, you've actually
softened up a little.

216
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,288
Shut your trap, Hina.

217
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,157
[HINA] Is that what I get
for helping you out?

218
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,726
And I might add,
for the umpteenth time, too?

219
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,795
My elite unit found
this ship for you.

220
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,064
A thanks would be nice.

221
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,333
Upset. Hina's upset.

222
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,135
Oh, don't give me that speech.

223
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,369
We're all Marines.

224
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,570
Oh, honestly.

225
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,640
I don't know how poor Tashigi
puts up with you, Smoker.

226
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,674
Heh.

227
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,645
She manages somehow.

228
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,314
I need you to take
this ship in to HQ.

229
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,582
[HINA]
Me?

230
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,385
[SMOKER] Also, Tashigi's going
to be bringing Crocodile here.

231
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,188
Kill two birds with one stone
and take him with you.

232
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,189
[HINA]
Give me a break!

233
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,992
I'm an officer, not your
personal errand girl!

234
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,202
It's heads.

235
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,071
[SMOKER]
It's tails.

236
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,008
You lose, errand girl.

237
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,277
You're a real piece of work,
you know that, Smoker?

238
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,045
I thought a few years of
command would change you,

239
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,680
but I guess I was wrong.

240
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,348
Hina's disappointed.

241
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,284
I'm well aware of that.

242
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,885
And I don't care.

243
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,891
Negative.

244
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,226
That's an order!

245
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,427
Sergeant Major!

246
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,429
With all due respect, why not?

247
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,031
With your permission,
we can capture

248
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,099
all the Straw Hats
in one fell swoop!

249
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,201
Denied!

250
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,436
I will not allow you to lay
a hand on any of them!

251
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,205
Is that understood?

252
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,873
[MARINE B] But we're never
gonna get another chance

253
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,874
like this again!

254
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,442
They're sitting ducks right now!

255
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,212
Look, Major...

256
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,785
[VIVI]
Just hang on, leader.

257
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,286
We'll get you taken care of.

258
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,457
And your father too. Leader.

259
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,726
There was a sandstorm in Yuba.

260
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,763
[KOZA] Still a worrywart
as always, I see.

261
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,265
I don't know how Yuba fared,

262
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,067
but take my word for it,
a sandstorm

263
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,903
is no match for my
stubborn old man.

264
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,072
I hope so.

265
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,074
[KOZA]
Don't worry about me, either.

266
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,309
I've got his blood in my veins.

267
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,980
As soon as I get
treated, I'll head to Yuba.

268
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,016
I'll keep you updated.
So don't worry, all right?

269
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,150
[VIVI]
All right.

270
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,287
[TOWNSPERSON A]
It's actually raining!

271
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,356
[TOWNSPERSON B] This is the
first time in three years!

272
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,423
It's a miracle!

273
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,425
[TOWNSPERSON C] This rain
will end the rebellion!

274
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,461

Our foolish sons will come home!

[DUGONGS cheering]

278
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,548
[KOZA] How long are you gonna
be stubborn, old man?

279
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,452
Father, look around!
Yuba is finished! A ghost town!

280
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,988
What're you gonna
do here by yourself?

281
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,190
Are you gonna
dry up and die, too?

282
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,458
Old man?

283
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,798
See, son. Look there.

284
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,900
The rain has come back.

285
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,538
Just like I told you.

286
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,875
I knew that it would come back.

287
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,209
I was right.

288
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,147
Yes.

289
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,815
Right as rain.

290
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,354
[NARRATOR] The rain that
falls in the kingdom

291
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,589
is more than just
a physical one,

292
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,526
but also a symbolic
one that washes away

293
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,329
the bitter tears
of its recent past.

294
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,270

What are you still doing up?

Oh, hey, Igaram.

‐‐It's nothing.
‐‐[door closes]

300
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,092
You can't sleep, huh?

301
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,294
[VIVI]
It's not that.

302
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,364
I just don't want
to sleep right now.

303
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,632
I'd rather watch the rain fall.

304
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,035
It's been so long
since I've seen it.

305

[GROUP snoring]

306
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,388
[IGARAM]
Vivi, about Pell.

307
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,289
He was, without a doubt,

308
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,625
the strongest, most loyal
and dignified warrior

309
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,894
I ever served with.

310
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,429
He was.

311
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,432
I just wish I could
have said thank you.

312
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,071
He'd be greatly honored
by that, Princess.

313
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,885
[MARINE E]
Captain Smoker! Miss Hina!

00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,853

Tashigi has arrived!

315
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,657
[MARINES]
Welcome back, Sergeant Major!

316
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,292
It sure has been
a while, Tashigi.

317
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,995
[TASHIGI]
Hina.

318
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,665
Good to see you again.

319
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,134
If you'll excuse me,
I'm a little tired,

320
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,969
so I'm going to get some rest.

321
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,908
[TASHIGI]
We're back, Captain Smoker.

322
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,209
Did you get my report?

323
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,212
Sure did. Thanks for your work.

324
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,315
I heard about what happened
with the Straw Hats.

325
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,652
I'm sorry, sir.
I helped the pirates.

326
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,353
We also had an opportunity
to capture them,

327
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,055
and I let it slip away.

328
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,025
It's all my fault.

329
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,028
My actions were shameful.
I'm sorry.

330
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,863
Why are you apologizing?

331
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,931
Stop it.

332
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,835
Didn't you follow your
justice like I told you to?

333
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,870
[TASHIGI]
No. That's not it.

334
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,206
[MARINE B]
Sergeant Major.

335
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,214
[TASHIGI] It's just that I
didn't have any other choice.

336
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:40,185
[CROCODILE] Justice is only
for the people who take it.

337
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,721
That's the kind of world
we live in, girl.

338
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,360
Tell me which
way Crocodile went.

339
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,895
Which way did he go?!

340
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,866
[TASHIGI] I was charged with
bringing Crocodile in,

341
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,734
but I wasn't strong enough.

342
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,736
When Straw Hat Luffy
asked where he was,

343
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:00,038
all I could do was tell him.

344
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,208
I was also no match
for Nico Robin.

345
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,776
I was too weak.

346
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,148
So there was no
justice I could follow.

347
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,120
[SMOKER] I get it. You thought
you were strong enough

348
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,756
to defeat Crocodile,
but you weren't,

349
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,292
so the Straw Hats stepped
up and did it instead.

350
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,396
The Straw Hats know
what you have to do

351
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,398
to survive in this sea.

352
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,468
You either step up, or you die.

353
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,404
You did what you could,
but it wasn't enough.

354
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,340
Luckily, you're still alive.

355
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,342
Learn from this experience.

[TASHIGI]
With your permission, sir,

357
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,982
I'm going to get some rest.

358
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,284
If you'll excuse me.

Don't cry about it.

361
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,102
Do what the Straw Hats did!

362
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,271
Step up, and become stronger!

363
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,016
Sir, yes, sir!

364
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,490
[SMOKER] I just wish the rest
of you had the same kind

of guts that she does.

366
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,462
All right, get those prisoners
loaded on the ship!

[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

you on the transponder snail.

370

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL] This is
Marine Headquarters calling.

371
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,972
Could I speak with
Captain Smoker, please?

372
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,974
[SMOKER]
Smoker here.

373
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,509
Congratulations on subduing
Sir Crocodile, Captain.

374
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,979
As a result, the top officials
of the World Government

375
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,214
have ordered that both you
and Sergeant Major Tashigi

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,983
be given medals
for your efforts.

377
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,150
Subduing?

378
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,152
No, wait, hold on a minute!

379
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,154
We aren't the ones
who took down Crocodile‐‐

380
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,589
it was the Straw Hats.

381
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,359
Did anyone even bother
to read the report?

382
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,327
Furthermore, as thanks
for your gallantry,

383
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,895
it's also been decided
that each of you

384
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,564
will be promoted by one rank.

385
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,332
Hey! I told you!

386
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,234
For the umpteenth time,
it wasn't us!

387
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,503
Me and Tashigi weren't the
ones who stopped Crocodile

388
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,371
and Baroque Works!

389
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,107
It was those damn
Straw Hat Pirates!

390
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,908
[HINA]
Stop, Smoker. It's no use.

391
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,443
It's obvious at this point
that the Government's

392
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,846
going to cover up
this entire incident.

393
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,848
Think of the scandal if word
of what really happened

394
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,883
got out.
Alabasta was almost toppled,

395
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,351
and it wasn't saved
by the Government,

396
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,954
but by a group
of wanted pirates.

397
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,922
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL] And of
course, we expect both of you

Like hell we will!

Smoker, don't be dumb!
Accept it!

401
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,898
If you disobey the brass,
you could get court‐marshaled!

402
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,034
[SMOKER] Well, better
that than live a lie.

403
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,036
We didn't take Crocodile down.

404
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,471
My subordinate's in tears
because we couldn't.

405

Hey, you.

406
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,042
Could you pass on a
personal message from me

407

to the old geezers at HQ?

Don't do it, Smoker!
