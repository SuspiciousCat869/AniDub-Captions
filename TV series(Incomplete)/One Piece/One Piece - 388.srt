1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,283
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,785
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,373
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:51,296
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,090
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,468
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,138
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,516
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,644
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,231
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,526
[NARRATOR] While searching
for Fishman Island,

48
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,613
Luffy and his crew encountered
the Mermaid, Camie,

49
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,573
and the starfish, Pappagu.

50
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,535
A group of kidnappers known
as the Flying Fish Riders

51
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,287
had captured
their friend Hachi

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,539
and in return for directions
to Fishman Island,

53
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,500
the Straw Hats volunteered
to help rescue him.

54
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,086
They can come
from the sea or sky,

55
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,713
but we'll be ready.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,798
We're gonna beat
the crap out of 'em.

57
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,719
[LUFFY]
Listen up, you guys!

58
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:52,106
[LUFFY]
Time to fight!

59
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,193
[ALL]
Yeah!

60
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,489
[LUFFY]
Tragedy!

61
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,367
The Truth Hidden
Under Duval's Mask!

62
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,458
[cheering]

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,585
Let's get 'em, boys!

64
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,311
Fresh fish delivery!

65
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,522
Let's see, which one do I want?

66
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,572
Hey, hey, hey!

67
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,324
'Kay. That one.

68
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,708
[LUFFY]
Here, fishy, fishy!

69
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,251
My turn!

70
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,252
Hey!

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,757
Woo! Nice ride!

72
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,134
Look, guys!

73
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,263
I'm flying!

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,888
This is bad!

75
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,640
What if he falls?!

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,933
Whatever.

77
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,269
Try some of these!

78
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,188
Uh-oh!

79
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,445
[FISH RIDER 388C]
Damn it!

80
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,950
Nami swan! Robin dear!

81
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,827
Did you see my moves back there?

82
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,620
[USOPP] They're gonna
sink the ship at this rate!

83
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,788
That was close!

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,748
Punks.

85
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,541
If they hit a lady
with one of those bombs,

86
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,251
then there'll be hell to pay.

87
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,210
Draw the sails!

88
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,545
They'll get in the way!

89
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,755
[USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER]
Got it!

90
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,884
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Everyone dive!

91
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,177
[FISH RIDERS]
Roger!

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,145
[CHOPPER]
Luffy!

93
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,688
[BROOK]
Try not to drown!

94
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,484
[FRANKY]
Oh, come on!

95
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,914
[FRANKY] We're having a damn
fight here. Don't screw around!

96
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,458
[LUFFY]
Sorry.

97
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,419
And you two are even worse!

98
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,004
What the hell did you
think was gonna happen?

99
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,215
You have Devil Fruit powers!

100
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,552
I... was just trying to help.

101
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,016
I'm sorry to have caused
you so much trouble, friends.

102
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,768
In the future, how about

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,937
when we're in the middle
of a big, dangerous fight,

104
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,565
you don't try to drown
yourselves in the ocean, okay?

105
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,984
Jeez! I shoulda
let you guys sink!

106
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,489
[CAMIE and PAPPAGU]
Ah! It's the Macro Gang!

107
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,365
Now's our chance!

108
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,617
Get her while the
Straw Hats are busy!

109
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,701
[GYARO and TANSUI]
Yeah!

110
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,536
--Hey guys, stop drowning
--Luffychin! Anybody!

111
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,537
--and get over here
--I don't wanna

112
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,121
--to help us already!
--be kidnapped again!

113
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,708
[HACHI]
Camie! Pappagu!

114
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,548
[HACHI]
Damn it! Let me out!

115
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,809
[HACHI] I thought I was gonna
be in there forever! Thanks!

116
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,686
I know we've got some
bad blood between us,

117
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,563
but you're a great guy, Roronoa!

118
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,441
Sure, but I was just
following orders, so...

119
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,027
[MACRO, GYARO, TANSUI]
Wait!

120
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,572
[cheering]

121
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,656
You buncha cowards!

122
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,451
You used me like a punching
bag while I was tied up!

123
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,828
Do you really think
I'm gonna let that slide?

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,956
Baha! You want another taste
of my Fishman Karate?

125
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,041
Fine! You don't scare me!

126
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,586
Want some? Bring it on!

127
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,670
I admit...

128
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,338
It was fun beating on you
when you were tied up

129
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,507
and couldn't fight back.
But I ain't picky--

130
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,842
I'll beat on you
any way you like,

131
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,971
and if you got any requests,
direct 'em to my fists!

132
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,516
My sword and my ancient
goldfish fighting style

133
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,934
will rip you to pieces,

134
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,728
and the sea will
run red with blood!

135
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,938
--Hatchin!
--Hachi!

136
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,693
[HACHI]
Take this!

137
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,862
Takoyaki Punch!

138
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,532
[TANSUI, MACRO, GYARO]
We'll let you go this time!

139
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,825
[CAMIE]
Hatchin!

140
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,952
[HACHI]
Camie! Pappagu!

141
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,622
[CAMIE]
I'm so glad you're okay!

142
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
[HACHI]
Nyuuu!

143
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,750
I can't believe I got
captured by those idiots.

144
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,585
I didn't wanna
put you in danger!

145
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,211
[PAPPAGU]
It's fine!

146
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,921
We're all safe now, right?

147
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,132
[PAPPAGU]
Watch out!

148
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,885
Hey, stupid, did you
forget about us already?

149
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,846
If you want your buddy back,
you'll have to go through us!

150
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,680
But good luck with that!

151
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,475
'cause you're in
our territory, pal!

152
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,816
--[HACHI] Roronoa!
--[CAMIE] Zorochin!

153
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,074
[ZORO] You let your
guard down too easily.

154
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,159
Stay back and leave this to us.

155
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,120
Don't worry. We'll be
done here in no time.

156
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,957
It looks like I owe
you again, Roronoa.

157
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,168
I'm so sorry for
what I did to you before!

158
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,836
Excuse me?

159
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,798
[HACHI]
Back when we fought,

160
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,175
I hurt you pretty bad
with my Six Sword Style.

161
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,176
Oh, did you?

162
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,136
'Cause I don't think
you hit me even once!

163
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,138
Nyu? Oh, I guess not.

164
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,811
[USOPP] All right,
Chopper, line it up!

165
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,437
Let's see how they like this!

166
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,689
[CHOPPER]
Fire!

167
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,235
[USOPP]
You see that?

168
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,737
Three in one shot! Bull's eye!

169
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,073
That was awesome!

170
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,868
[DUVAL] Any of you men got
the balls to do a Zero Fight?

171
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,203
[FISH RIDERS]
A Zero Fight?

172
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,413
[FISH RIDER 388H]
Interesting.

173
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,873
But I don't know if I'm
up for the broken bones.

174
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,376
That mean you're gonna
pay the medical bills?

175
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,045
[DUVAL] How does
a million berries sound?

176
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,171
[FISH RIDERS]
Ahh!

177
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,381
[FISH RIDER 388E]
I'll do it, Head!

178
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,968
Step back, boys!
This is how it's done!

179
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,347
Some big guy's
coming right at us.

180
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,266
He's got a huge club.

181
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,518
[SANJI] Yeah, and looks
like he's not steering.

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,520
Don't tell me the
lunatic's trying to crash

183
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,938
straight into our ship.

184
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,401
[SANJI] With that size and
speed, he'll end up sinking us.

185
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,154
Luffy, you get the fish, okay?

186
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,905
Yeah. No prob.

187
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,948
Get ready!

188
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,034
If you think you can stop me,
go ahead and try,

189
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,536
but I'm slamming
into you either way!

190
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,871
[CHOPPER]
Sanji's right!

191
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,372
He's not turning away!

192
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,832
[SANJI]
No problem.

193
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,294
Sure, he's fast,
but if he flies into me,

194
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,920
he's done for!

195
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,842
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Balloon!

196
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,320
[splash]

197
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,407
[LUFFY] I know what
we're having for dinner.

198
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,826
[CHOPPER]
Oh wow! It's huge!

199
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,245
It sure could have
caused a lot of damage!

200
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,330
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Damn.

201
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,248
These pirates are a putting
up one hell of a fight.

202
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
Who woulda thought?

203
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
[NAMI]
Usopp!

204
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
There sure are
a lot of those guys.

205
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,546
That's annoying.

206
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,298
How many of 'em do
you think we have to beat

207
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,883
before they just give up?

208
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
I wanna ride one!

209
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,473
Don't think I'm
gonna stop trying

210
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,141
'cause of what
happened last time!

211
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,434
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,353
I'm not swimming
after you again!

213
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,272
[BROOK]
How devastating.

214
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,316
Come on, Brook.
What's wrong?

215
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,151
To think that
in my first battle

216
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,237
as a member of the crew,

217
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,905
all I did was drown!

218
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,282
[BROOK]
If I cannot right this wrong,

219
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,993
how can I call myself a man?

220
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,871
I wonder how many
I can strike down.

221
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,041
I am of meager talent,
but I shall do my best.

222
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
Stand back and observe.

223
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,630
Cool!

224
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,882
Whoa. What a takeoff!

225
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,970
[FISH RIDER 388G] What's with
the weird skeleton mask?

226
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,597
I'll run him straight through!

227
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,516
[BROOK]
Lullaby.

228
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:12,189
[violin music]

229
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:15,317
Look! They all fell asleep.

230
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,527
You, too?

231
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,447
[BROOK]
Yohoho!

232
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,909
[BROOK]
Music is power!

233
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,870
Coming through!
Yohohohoho!

234
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,080
[FISH RIDER 388A]
Ah! I fell asleep!

235
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,376
[FISH RIDER 386A] What the
hell kinda move was that?

236
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
[FISH RIDER 388C] I dunno,
but whatever it was,

237
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,213
it was a dirty trick.

238
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,049
It wasn't a trick at all, sir.

239
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,052
It was music! Yohohoho!

240
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,054
[FISH RIDERS]
Get back here!

241
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:48,058
[BROOK]
Yohohohoho! Yohohohoho!

242
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,145
Yohohohoho! Yoho!

243
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:51,896
Not bad.

244
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,355
Looks like fun, too.

245
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,357
I gotta step things up.

246
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,650
Here goes!

247
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,110
Oh no, not again!

248
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,570
Luffy, come back!

249
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:01,989
There!

250
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:02,865
Now I gotcha!

251
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:07,453
Hey, don't dive.
I'll smash your head in.

252
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,454
Are you kidding?

253
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,371
He's asleep?

254
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,415
Wake up, we're gonna crash!

255
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,629
[FISH RIDER 386A]
That punk!

256
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,672
He crashed straight
into the Head's room!

257
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,033
[DUVAL]
You saw, didn't you?

258
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,368
No way!

259
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,541
[DUVAL]
A familiar face, huh?

260
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,661
[BROOK]
Yohohohohoho!

261
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,371
Yohohohohoho!

262
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,708
Yohoho, yohohoho!

263
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,085
Yo! Yo ho ho!

264
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,590
Yohohohohoho!
Yohohohohoho!

265
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,634
[BROOK]
That's it for me!

266
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,344
I've got muscle cramps.

267
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,764
Ah, not that I have any muscles
to cramp in the first place.

268
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,812
Hey, nice work
back there, Brook.

269
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,607
You really thinned those
Fish Riders out, huh?

270
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,401
[BROOK] Uh-huh.
Happy to be of service.

271
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,653
But I think I need
a moment of respite.

272
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,997
Zoro, it's just as I thought.

273
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,499
Your injuries from Thriller
Bark haven't healed.

274
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,045
Injured or not,
there's no way I'm losing

275
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,963
to a bunch of fish.

276
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,840
I'll be fine.

277
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,674
[HACHI]
Nyu!

278
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,968
Don't let your
guard down, Roronoa!

279
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,012
Six Sword Style!

280
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,767
[HACHI]
Tentacle Sword Overload!

281
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,447
Was that you paying
me back for last time?

282
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,406
Nyuu!

283
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,116
Nah. Not really.

284
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,868
But you two gotta
watch your backs!

285
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,453
Nyuhuhuhu!

286
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,705
[CAMIE] That was
super cool, Hatchin!

287
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,373
[PAPPAGU]
Yeah!

288
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,999
I told 'em you were strong!

289
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,584
[HACHI]
Nyuu! Really?

290
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,587
[FISH RIDER 388I]
Die, fishman!

291
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,715
[BROOK]
Oops! Pardon me!

292
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,515
Nyu. I thought
I was gonna die!

293
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,100
Thanks a lot, you guys!

294
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, it was my pleasure.

295
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,562
Who needs to
watch his back again?

296
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,606
[FISH RIDER 386A]
We can't take 'em alone!

297
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,108
Revert to formation!

298
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,070
Pervert? You called?

301
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,077
That's gotta be me.

302
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,829
--They're not talking about you!
--They're not talking about you!

Get ready.

304
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,670
Over here! Hey!

305
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,131
Come get me!

306
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,007
She's cute.

307
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,133
Well, that's a damn shame.

308
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,135
The Head said to kill 'em all!

309
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,928
I'd like to see you try.

310
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,432
[RANDOM FISH RIDER 388B]
What the hell? Whoa!

311
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,435
Too bad.

Mirage Tempo.

313
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,564
Oh, and watch out for those

Eat this!

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,043
You sure?

322
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,878
Maybe I need to get
my ears checked.

323
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,754
Whoa!

324
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,673

00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,766
Like super-duper tough!

00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,641

Oh, yeah.

331
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,686
These guys are tough, all right.

332
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,522
But I thought we'd just grab
Hachi and maybe get out of here.

333
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,274
Not fight to the last man!

334
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,151

A little bit closer...

335
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:51,987
Hey, Franky!

336
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,781
We gotta pull the ship ashore!

337
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,532
They've got the
upper hand in the ocean!

338
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,077
Out here we're nothing
but sitting ducks!

339
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,828
Yeah, but you think
they don't know that?

340
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,121
This is their base.

341
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,498
If we try to move the ship,

342
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,166
they'll just come
at us twice as hard.

00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,159
[DUVAL] Look at you, getting
swatted down left and right.

353
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,662
Oh crap!
What the heck is that?

354
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,958
[DUVAL] You're not mosquitoes,
men, you're Flying Fish Riders!

355
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,627
[USOPP] Did... he just
crush his own house?

356
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,005
[DUVAL] With the Straw Hats
dead, I won't need this base!

357
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,216
Don't hold back!

358
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:54,967
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Head!

359
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,093
We're sorry!

360
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,095
We'll drag 'em off to the sea
and finish 'em for sure!

361
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,596
[DUVAL]
Move it!

362
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,850
[DUVAL] I don't care about
fishmen or mermaids

363
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,810
or giant talking gloves!

364
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,896
I'll give you 5 seconds
to get the hell out of my way!

365
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,982
[PAPPAGU] Okay,
but I'm a starfish!

366
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,233
[DUVAL]
Hmph.

367
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,070
I didn't get into the slave
trade market 'cause I wanted to.

368
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,823
You know that, don't you?

369
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,241
Of course, Head.

370
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,909
Good luck!

371
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,245
[DUVAL] This is the
greatest day of my life!

372
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:27,166
The man that I've dreamed of
killing is right before my eyes.

373
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,003
I may have suffered to get here,
but it's all been worth it.

374
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,381
I gotta admit that miracles
can happen after all.

375
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,884
I never did a damn
thing to that bastard

376
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,760
and he made my life hell!

377
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,929
He ruined me!

378
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,264
[USOPP]
Hey. What's his deal?

379
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,099
Is he talking to us?

380
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,144
[DUVAL] I've got nothing
to lose anymore.

381
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,604
I'm ending this.

382
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,899
Even if I die...
I'm killing you.

383
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,360
Do you hear me,
Black Leg Sanji?

384
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,865
[DUVAL] Ah been waiting
for this for a long time.

385
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,782
He's mad!

386
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,784
His accent-- it's
starting to come out!

387
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,785
Me?

388
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,704
But what in the hell did I do?

389
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,747
That's weird.

390
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,832
Sanji, hey. What gives?

391
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,793
What the heck did you do
to piss this guy off so bad?

392
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,795
Maybe something
back on the Baratie?

393
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,172
C'mon, try to remember.

394
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,090
Well, if we're
going back that far...

395
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,385
Ah, I did all sorts of stuff
to piss people off.

396
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,304
Jeez, I can't even
count them all.

397
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,932
Well... better let him
kill you, then.

398
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,310
[DUVAL] Don't play dumb
with me, Black Leg!

399
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,812
It wasn't that
long ago, damn it!

400
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,856
Look out!

401
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,358
Those are harpoons!

402
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,737
Huh, if it was
something recent,

403
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,239
I'm even more confused.

404
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,785
Whoa, this is
not good, guys.

405
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,370
There's something up
with these harpoons.

406
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,414
[DUVAL] My scorpion harpoons
are packed with poison.

407
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:53,168
If they so much as nick you,
you won't last 3 minutes!

408
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,921
I'm gonna kill you
and your friends!

409
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,966
[SANJI]
Nami! Watch out!

410
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,844
Damn it, who in the hell
is this bastard?

411
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,388
Just tell me!

412
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,099
[DUVAL] You reap
what you sow, Black Leg!

413
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,935
I saw what was
under that mask of his.

414
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,187
Oh yeah? Then who is he?

415
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,856
You'll be surprised
but you've seen his face.

416
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,983
I have?

417
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,368
Ah! That punk!

418
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,001
[FISH RIDERS] He knocked
off Master Duval's mask!

419
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,883
[DUVAL]
Go ahead. Look.

420
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,803
See this cursed face of mine!

421
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,721
Wha--?

422
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,847
No...

423
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,903
You're kidding.

424
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,946
My!

425
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,906
Well, I say!

426
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,452
I could cry!

427
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,912
[DUVAL] Ah been
waiting for this day.

428
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,332
Ah knew I couldn't let you live,

429
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,460
so I set out to sea
to put an end to this.

430
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,379
But ah knew ah had
my work cut out for me,

431
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,133
'cause your wanted poster
didn't look nothin' like you.

432
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,345
Even if the Navy or
some bounty hunters saw you,

433
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,055
they'd never know
they were looking

434
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,098
at the guy on the poster.

435
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,434
But they found
someone else.

436
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,270
Someone they hounded
day in and day out.

437
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,022
[FISH RIDERS]
Oh, Head.

438
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,191
[DUVAL]
And when they found him,

439
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,859
do ya know what they'd say?

440
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,988
"You can't hide from us!

441
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,492
Black Leg Sanji!"

442
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,038
[DUVAL] And then do ya
know what I told 'em?

443
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,291
"Ah never even
met the guy before!"

444
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,879
And not only that,
I ain't even a pirate!

445
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:12,182
[SANJI]
You shut your damn mouth!

446
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,400
[LUFFY]
The Sunny's in trouble!

447
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,276
[CHOPPER] We're all
gonna sink! We'll drown!

448
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,986
[FRANKY] Simmer down,
I got this one.

449
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,156
Don't you know I'm
especially super this week?

450
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,574
Now sit back and watch.

451
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,535
I'll show you the
Sunny's true power!

452
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,496
[LUFFY and CHOPPER]
Whoa! That's so cool!

453
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,164
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

454
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,165
"Explosion!

455
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,460
Sunny's Super-Secret
Weapon, Gaon Cannon!"

456
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,046
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
