00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.402
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:07.805
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:10.605
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.775
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.045
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:15.045
You can have it!

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:17.975
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.185
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:23.015
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:28.393
and sail into the
Great Pirate Era!

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.356
[NARRATOR] After a deadly
struggle on Fishman Island,

00:02:38.356 --> 00:02:41.286
the Straw Hats have finally
arrived in the New World.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.856
There, they met a young
Giant girl named Lily,

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:45.566
who ate the Mini-Mini Fruit.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.366
Lily enlisted the help
of the Straw Hats

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:49.736
to rescue her father,
a famous chef

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:52.706
known as Panz Fry,
from the Navy.

00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:57.136
But the Neo Navy, led by Shuzo,
stood in their way.

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.606
After saving Panz Fry
in the nick of time,

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:01.876
the Straw Hats are
on the run from Shuzo

00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:03.876
and his Neo Navy soldiers.

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:06.986
[NAMI]
Good job, guys, we did it!

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.386
[GROUP]
All right!

00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:12.056
Now, if someone could bring
those ingredients over,

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:13.726
I'll get started.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.396
This will be a meal
you won't soon forget!

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.926
[LUFFY]
Really? Thanks a lot, food guy!

00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:20.496
I can't wait!

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.296
[LUFFY, LILY chuckle]

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.736
Shuzo, sir!

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.906
I've located the
Straw Hat Pirates.

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:35.816
It seems that they're all
hiding out on the other side

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:37.146
of that reef.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:38.276
Those cowards!

00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:40.986
I want all ships on
the attack, right now!

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:44.416
We'll tear the whole reef
apart along with them!

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:47.086
[NEO MARINE A] I-I'm sorry, sir,
but we used up all of our

00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:49.426
torpedoes in the
last confrontation.

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:52.196
We're almost out
of bombshells too.

00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:54.826
[NEO MARINE C]
We can use this submersible.

00:03:54.826 --> 00:03:56.366
Instead of a torpedo!

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:57.996
We have to!

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:00.936
After all, we are the Neo Navy.

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:03.176
We can't give up!

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.846
Trusting you and Master Z
has gotten us this far;

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:08.546
why stop now?

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:11.216
Please, Shuzo, we want
to fight those pirates

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.486
alongside you!

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.716
I admire your spirit, soldiers.

00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:16.686
I won't soon forget that.

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:18.826
Now fight to your
hearts' content,

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:20.786
for the proud Neo Navy!

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:24.656
[NEO MARINES yell]

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:27.326
[SHUZO] Hit them with
everything we've got!

00:04:40.376 --> 00:04:43.016
[LUFFY] "Z's Ambition!
Luffy VS. Shuzo!"

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:52.226
[PANZ yells]

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.326
Food Guy, no!

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:54.386
Not again!

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:57.426
What was that?

00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:58.666
[CHOPPER]
They're back!

00:04:58.666 --> 00:04:59.826
[BROOK]
Already?

00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.336
Okay, let's go!

00:05:16.576 --> 00:05:17.716
[SANJI]
Back off!

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:23.016
[NEO MARINE B yells]

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:26.526
Hold up, those aren't torpedoes!

00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:28.026
They're ships with
people in them!

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:30.126
For our cause, we will die!

00:05:37.396 --> 00:05:39.306
[PANZ growls]

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:40.906
[NEO MARINE C yells]

00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:46.546
What's wrong with these guys?

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.776
They use themselves as ammo?

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:50.876
They're either stupid or crazy.

00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:24.016
[SHUZO laughs]

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:27.186
Long time, no see, pirate scum.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:28.416
Time's up!

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:29.356
That guy?

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:30.786
How did he find out
where we were?

00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:32.456
[SHUZO laughs]

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:33.626
I have this!

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.356
[NAMI]
A Vivre Card?

00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:37.156
[SHUZO] When your ship
went soaring out of the

00:06:37.156 --> 00:06:39.766
Thrust Up Stream,
I threw it onto the raft!

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:45.806
[CHOPPER yells]

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:47.436
Ochenta Fleurs should do!

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.106
[NEO MARINE D yells]

00:06:57.846 --> 00:07:00.016
They sacrificed their lives.

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:01.846
They won't perish in vain!

00:07:09.956 --> 00:07:12.626
This dude is super crazy!
Big time!

00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:14.626
[SHUZO] Wretched pirates
like you are the reason

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:16.496
the New World's in such a mess.

00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:18.136
That's why we can't stop!

00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:23.136
Not until all of you are dead!

00:07:25.206 --> 00:07:26.306
Panz Fry!

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:28.406
Don't move, you need to heal!

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.176
[PANZ growls]

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:36.386
[PANZ yells]

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:39.526
Why, you--!

00:07:41.686 --> 00:07:43.056
[LILY yells]

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:45.766
[LILY gasps]

00:07:46.826 --> 00:07:48.196
[LILY grunts]

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:49.396
Lily!

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:51.896
[USOPP]
Ah...!

00:07:51.896 --> 00:07:53.236
Don't squash me!

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.946
[PANZ groans]

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.956
You may have gotten
lucky the last time.

00:08:13.286 --> 00:08:15.086
But you won't escape twice!

00:08:16.856 --> 00:08:18.866
[SHUZO grunts]

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.296
Get up, Dad!

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:23.036
[SHUZO grunts]

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.776
Stay away from him.

00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:29.906
[PANZ groans]

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:31.136
That was close!

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.546
Kick his butt, Luffy!

00:08:37.076 --> 00:08:40.246
If you want him,
you'll have to go through me.

00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:43.716
So we meet again, rubber man.

00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:45.886
Another pirate to kill, huh?

00:08:45.886 --> 00:08:47.926
That's fine, I was gonna
wipe out your crew

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:49.256
sooner or later.

00:08:49.256 --> 00:08:51.756
If you're in such
a hurry to get killed,

00:08:51.756 --> 00:08:53.496
I'll grant your wish!

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:04.806
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:08.506
...Jet Gatling!

[yelling]

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:11.976
[SHUZO growls]

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:15.986

[LUFFY]
...Jet Whip!

[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:21.186
[SHUZO]
Shave!

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:23.096
...And Jet Bazooka!

00:09:24.796 --> 00:09:25.996
[SHUZO]
Moon Walk!

00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:31.096
[SHUZO grunts]

00:09:36.536 --> 00:09:39.446
Armament! Gum-Gum...

00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:45.983
Now, Pistol!

00:09:54.123 --> 00:09:56.793
--[NAMI] Woohoo!
--[CHOPPER] Yeah! Go, Luffy!

00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:06.933
Iron Body!

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:11.473
Your Haki's not too shabby, kid,

00:10:11.473 --> 00:10:13.473
but it's still not as
good as mine!

00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:14.743
What'd he say?

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:16.913
So he uses Haki too.

00:10:16.913 --> 00:10:18.513
This fight's getting tricky.

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:20.283
[SHUZO laughs]

00:10:32.093 --> 00:10:33.663
Those long arms are a pain.

00:10:33.663 --> 00:10:35.033
[SHUZO laughing]

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.193
Don't tell me that's
the best you've got, pirate!

00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:39.133
Maybe you'll like Third Gear!

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:40.463
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:43.503
[LUFFY yells]

00:10:44.473 --> 00:10:45.673
Luffy!

00:11:00.553 --> 00:11:01.893
I'm impressed.

00:11:01.893 --> 00:11:03.693
I thought you'd be dead by now.

00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:19.873
Bet you've never seen a
bombshell wrapped in Haki,

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.573
have you?

00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:25.843
Say hello to my dear partner,
Beast Cannon Alpacacino!

00:11:25.843 --> 00:11:28.583
He's a bazooka that
ate a Devil Fruit.

00:11:28.583 --> 00:11:30.513
[ALPACACINO laughs]

00:11:30.513 --> 00:11:31.983
Finger Pistol.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:33.753
Or rather, five!

00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:36.723
[LUFFY grunts]

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:42.833
He stabbed him!

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:45.203
[SHUZO laughs]

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:47.263
Your captain is done for.

00:11:47.263 --> 00:11:48.933
Now who's next?

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:52.603
Luffy!

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:53.773
This is awful!

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:56.543
Damn you.

00:12:00.943 --> 00:12:02.113
No, please.

00:12:02.113 --> 00:12:03.453
Stop it!

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.783
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:12:15.263 --> 00:12:16.793
[LILY]
Oh, Dad!

00:12:16.793 --> 00:12:18.563
[USOPP whimpers]

00:12:18.563 --> 00:12:20.903
Listen, Usopp.
I've got an idea!

00:12:20.903 --> 00:12:21.733
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:24.903
Use your slingshot to fire me
right into that guy's mouth!

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:25.873
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:12:25.873 --> 00:12:27.873
I'll get inside his stomach
and turn big again.

00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:29.643
It'll rip that monster
to shreds!

00:12:31.443 --> 00:12:33.383
Well, if you say so!

00:12:33.383 --> 00:12:34.413
[USOPP]
Ready?

00:12:36.483 --> 00:12:37.553
[LILY]
Yeah!

00:12:37.553 --> 00:12:39.883
[USOPP]
Aim... Fire!

00:12:43.393 --> 00:12:45.093
[SHUZO laughs]

00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.133
Wait, not Luffy!

00:12:50.893 --> 00:12:52.663
[LILY]
No!

00:12:53.903 --> 00:12:54.903
Come on.

00:12:54.903 --> 00:12:56.903
Did you think I hadn't
guessed your plan?

00:12:56.903 --> 00:12:58.473
Ha! Nice try!

00:13:03.673 --> 00:13:06.143
Now I can get back to
killing the rest of you!

00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:08.353
[laughing]

00:13:08.353 --> 00:13:09.453
What? No!

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:12.923
[LUFFY]
Not yet.

00:13:12.923 --> 00:13:14.453
[SHUZO]
Uh... What?

00:13:22.993 --> 00:13:24.163
Not yet.

00:13:24.163 --> 00:13:26.603
'Cause I'm still not
finished with you!

00:13:26.603 --> 00:13:29.703
You stupid-- Why won't you die?

00:13:37.873 --> 00:13:39.513
Two things.

00:13:39.513 --> 00:13:42.153
First I'm gonna kick
your sorry ass,

00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:43.853
then I'll eat this guy's food.

00:13:43.853 --> 00:13:44.983
Got it?

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:48.153
[SHUZO growls]

00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:49.393
Are you ready?

00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:51.893
I'm about to grow!

Whoa!

[NEO MARINES yell]

00:14:23.053 --> 00:14:24.393
[USOPP]
Ah...!

00:14:27.393 --> 00:14:28.893
He's gigantic!

00:14:28.893 --> 00:14:30.663
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:14:30.663 --> 00:14:33.203
I call that super-size!

00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:04.901
This is crazy!

00:15:04.901 --> 00:15:06.671
Where did these badass
horns come from

00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:09.241
all of a sudden?

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:10.871
You guys are so tiny!

00:15:10.871 --> 00:15:12.511
Did something happen to you?

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:13.711
[USOPP]
Gah!

00:15:13.711 --> 00:15:16.381
We didn't get tiny, you idiot,
you just got bigger!

00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:17.581
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:20.181
Lily flew into your
body and made you grow.

00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:21.851
Did you not notice that at all?

00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:23.891
Oh, I guess not.

00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:25.391
I told you I could.

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.291
Neat trick, huh?

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.361
Oh, so that's why I can
hear your voice!

00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.791
I'm so hungry I thought it
was my stomach talking.

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:34.361
You're a giant, Luffy!
This is so cool!

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:35.361
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:40.101
Look at me!

00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:42.471
I'm so much bigger
than you guys now!

00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:43.641
Woohoo!

00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:45.771
[laughing]

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:46.981
You idiot!

00:15:46.981 --> 00:15:49.411
Big or small,
you are still a pirate!

00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:51.381
And I will still crush you!

00:15:57.751 --> 00:15:59.421
Right. I forgot.

00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:00.621
You guys are here!

00:16:00.621 --> 00:16:01.961
You forgot us?!

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:02.961
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:05.331
[LUFFY]
Gotcha now!

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.831
[grunts]

00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:10.801
Don't be so sure, kid.

00:16:10.801 --> 00:16:13.301
Now that you're a giant,
you won't move as quickly.

00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:14.671
Good luck catching me!

00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:19.571
Second Gear!

00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:32.691
[NAMI] Careful, Luffy,
that's a lot of hot air!

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.191
[CHOPPER]
We're gonna blow away!

00:16:51.541 --> 00:16:55.511
You pirates are still
no match for me!

00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:57.811
And I will never rest
until the New World

00:16:57.811 --> 00:16:59.181
is rid of you!

00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:01.181
[yelling]

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:04.551
[yelling continues]

00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:09.561
Don't hold your breath
on that one!

00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:19.201
All right, Gum-Gum...
Giant Jet Spear!

00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:21.001
Finger Pistols. All Ten!

00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:32.551
[SHUZO yells]

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.751
It's over!

00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:38.151
[LUFFY yells]

00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:39.191
[ALPACACINO bleats]

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.691
[USOPP yells]

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.571
Whoa! Don't you think
that was overkill?

00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:52.601
Yeah, I almost died.

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:02.941
Luffy!

00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:04.281
You did it!

00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:05.211
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:18:05.211 --> 00:18:06.451
Thanks a whole lot, Lily!

00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:07.451
Oh, no.

00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:09.781
I'm just glad I could do
something to help you out.

00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.891
You sure are a good
friend to have, Luffy!

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:13.291
Okay!

00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.521
Now your dad can make
some of that volcano food

00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:16.561
and I can eat it!

00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:18.261
[LILY laughs]

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.801
[LUFFY]
It's ruined!

00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:27.301
Should have thought about
that before you went

00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:29.271
on your giant rampage.

00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:30.541
Let's get going.

00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:32.471
No! I'm hungry!

00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:34.441
We'll pick up more
food on the way.

00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:36.881
I'm sure it won't take us
long to find a volcano.

00:18:36.881 --> 00:18:37.951
What do you say?

00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:42.551
Fine by me. Okay! Let's go!

00:18:42.551 --> 00:18:44.821
But what are we gonna
do with that big raft?

00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:46.091
It's too heavy.

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:48.791
Looks like Franky's
already got it all figured out.

00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:49.891
[BROOK]
Oh?

00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:52.331
[FRANKY]
Super!

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.231
[BROOK]
It's a perfect fit.

00:18:54.231 --> 00:18:56.401
You're an excellent shipwright.

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:57.731
Thank you, Franky!

00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:01.001
My pleasure, bro! Super!

00:19:21.461 --> 00:19:24.291
Momonga, I--!
I thought you were dead!

00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:26.131
How did you find me?

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:29.431
The same little tactic you
used on the Straw Hats.

00:19:29.431 --> 00:19:31.371
We placed this
on Panz Fry's body

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:34.271
before he was taken away.

00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:35.841
Vivre Cards.

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.111
They're quite useful
for tracking pirates.

00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:39.811
My old mentor taught me that.

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.941
[SHUZO growls]

00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:44.381
You dared to drag the
Navy into your scheme.

00:19:44.381 --> 00:19:47.681
The punishment for such
a crime will be a heavy one.

00:19:47.681 --> 00:19:50.221
I'm sending you and
your men to Impel Down.

00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:51.951
So I can rot in jail?

00:19:51.951 --> 00:19:52.951
Bastard!

00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.521
Torture my men
as much as you want,

00:19:54.521 --> 00:19:56.721
we'll never tell you a thing!

00:19:56.721 --> 00:20:00.661
If you plan to kill us,
do it here in the New World!

00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:07.201
[MOMONGA] No. You'll be
at the mercy of the law.

00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:08.241
[SHUZO gasps]

00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:13.811
[MOMONGA] That's how we
do things in the real Navy.

00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:04.031
Bye, everyone!

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:05.531
Thanks for all your help!

00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.131
Be safe, okay?

00:21:07.131 --> 00:21:09.531
I promise, I'll never
forget what you guys did

00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:10.871
for me and my dad!

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.031
[LUFFY laughs]

00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:13.571
It's not that big a deal!

00:21:13.571 --> 00:21:15.041
Thanks, you two!

00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:17.101
That dinner was incredible!

00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:19.311
Just take it easy
for a while, okay?

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:20.741
You're not done healing!

00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.641
Thank you,
I'll be sure to do that.

00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:24.481
You're the best, doctor!

00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:26.711
Really? The best, huh?

00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:29.281
Flattery will get you nowhere,
you big bastard!

00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:30.721
Bye, Lily!

00:21:30.721 --> 00:21:32.491
It was fun being a Giant!

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.261
We oughta do it again soon!

00:21:34.261 --> 00:21:35.561
Yeah, sure!

00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.791
You were the strongest
Giant I've ever met!

00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.391
It was awesome!

00:21:39.391 --> 00:21:40.731
[LUFFY]
See you around!

00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:49.101
[LUFFY chuckles]
Ready, crew?

00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:50.671
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:22:00.351 --> 00:22:02.481
[AIN] This is exactly what
I feared would happen.

00:22:07.691 --> 00:22:09.491
Forgive me, sir,
I should've been more stern

00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:10.861
with Shuzo.

00:22:10.861 --> 00:22:12.191
This is my fault.

00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:14.801
Master Z.

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:16.301
You don't suppose
the Navy already knows

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.831
what we're planning, do you?

00:22:21.371 --> 00:22:23.341
[Z]
I wouldn't worry.

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.771
But what if they--

00:22:24.771 --> 00:22:26.871
[Z] Even if they're
tortured to death,

00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:29.381
I'm confident our
soldiers won't talk.

00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:34.981
After all, those men
are proud members

00:22:34.981 --> 00:22:36.821
of the unstoppable Neo Navy.

00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:39.321
They're stronger than that.

00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:40.791
[AIN]
Right.

00:22:40.791 --> 00:22:41.991
I have a report!

00:22:41.991 --> 00:22:44.191
We'll be arriving at the
first Island soon, sir.

00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:49.801
Our moment of glory
is just around the corner.

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:52.031
Make preparations, Ain!

00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:54.171
The New World as we
know it is about to enter

00:22:54.171 --> 00:22:56.401
its final days.

00:22:56.401 --> 00:23:00.311
We'll exterminate those pirates
with our own two hands!

00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:01.881
Every single one!

00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:16.091
[NARRATOR] As the Straw Hat
pirates continue to navigate

00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:17.431
the restless sea,

00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:20.591
they encounter the first
island of the New World.

00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:23.561
The mere sight of it leaves
everyone aghast.

00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:26.701
But then, an emergency
distress call inspires them

00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:28.401
to investigate the island.

00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:31.041
Little do the crew suspect that
this is the start of a batte

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:33.341
the likes of which
they've never known.

00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.211
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

00:23:35.211 --> 00:23:38.711
"Arriving!
A Burning Island - Punk Hazard!"

00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:41.051
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
