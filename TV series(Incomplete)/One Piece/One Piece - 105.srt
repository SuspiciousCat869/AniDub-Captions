00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,757
Really? What's the matter?
Are ya hungry or something?

175
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,526
Luffy!

176
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,627
[LUFFY]
Huh?

177
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,929
[screams]

178
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,464
Luffy!

179
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,936
I‐I‐I‐I'll take you on if you
want, you smoke‐filled freak.

180
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,205
I didn't do so bad against
the bomb guy, you know.

181
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,473
So I'll just wait over
here in the corner

182
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,742
and you let me know
when you're ready, okay?

183
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,943
What's wrong?

184
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:08,548
I feel so helpless. It's like
when I fall into the sea.

185
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,250
All right, just what have
you done to Luffy?

186
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,286
The tip of this staff is
made from a substance

187
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,488
called Sea Prism Stone,
a rare mineral.

188
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,657
It supposedly exists
in one certain sea

189
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,625
in the distant corner
of the world.

190
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,593
Not much is known about it,

191
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,828
but it's believed to
give off mystical energy

192
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,398
on the same wavelength
as the ocean itself.

193
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,401
Basically, you can think of it
as a solid form of the sea.

194
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,404
So it affects Luffy the same
as if he fell in the ocean?

195
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,339
Prison cells at
Marine headquarters

196
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,807
are made of this same substance

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,743
to prevent criminals who
possess any Devil Fruit powers

198
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,979
from successfully escaping.

199
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,349
Well, then I'm betting this
cell is built the same way.

200
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,586
If it wasn't, you can be sure
I'd be long gone by now.

201
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,688
And you four'd be
on your way to prison

202
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,657
waiting for your date
with the hangman.

203
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,995
[USOPP screams]

204
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,163
Are you crazy?!

205
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,832
There's no point in fighting
in a situation like this!

206
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,000
Stop!

207
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,635
And besides,
what good is a sword

208
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,870
against a guy who's
made outta smoke?

209
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:09,208
[CROCODILE]
She's right. Give it up.

210
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,881
[CROCODILE] You're all
going to die together,

211
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,219
so why not make an
effort to get along first?

212
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,390
Huh. It's Crocodile.

213
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,225
All right!

214
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,134
[growls]

215
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,388
[chuckles]

216
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,089
[growls]

217
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,060
[USOPP, NAMI whimpering]

218
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,397
So he's one of the
Seven Warlords, is he?

219
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,601
Huh. You're every bit the
low‐life sea scum I imagined.

220
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,835
My, my.

221
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,839
You're every bit the wild dog
I heard you were, Smoker.

222
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,108
Unlike your superiors,
you've never really believed

223
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,377
I was on your side, have you?

224
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,013
And of course, you were right.

225
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,214
You know, Smoker,

226
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,451
I have a feeling you'll die
bravely in the line of duty.

227
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,753
I'll be more than happy
to inform the government

228
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,422
that you put up a valiant fight

229
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,425
against the vicious
Straw Hat Pirate here.

230
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,793
I haven't the vaguest idea

231
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,728
what really brought you
to this country,

232
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,930
but I'm betting
you're on your own.

233
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,932
We both know the government
would never order you

234
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,100
to come to this land.

235
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,104
They have every confidence
in me, a Warlord of the Sea.

236
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,474
You big old bag of wind,
you're Crocodile?

237
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,575
[CROCODILE]
Hm?

238
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,745
Come on and fight me like
a man, ya big dumb...

239
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,646
Pay attention, stupid!

240
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,915
You gotta remember
not to touch the bars!

241
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,049
Straw Hat Luffy,

242
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,951
I congratulate you
on getting this far,

243
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,921
and I promise to dispose
of you neatly and efficiently,

244
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,924
once our special guest of honor
has made her appearance.

245
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,592
A guest?

246
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,927
Why, even as we speak,

247
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,796
my partner is on
the way to fetch her.

248
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,473
[VIVI]
I can't afford to waste time

249
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,742
with these second‐rate thugs!

250
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,145
[VIVI]
Who's next?

251
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,653
Ya got some pretty impressive
moves there, Princess.

252
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,756
I gotta tell ya.

253
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,960
[MILLIONS A ] Of course,
I'd expect no less

254
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,163
from a former Frontier Agent.

255
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,099
But don't you think it's time
you accepted your fate?

256
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,102
[MILLIONS A laughing]

257
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,938
[VIVI] I have to get away
and reach the others!

258
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,611
Fun time's over! The boss
is waiting for you!

259
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,483
Don't you dare touch me!

260
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,018
[MILLIONS yell]

261
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,855
What is that thing?
Some kinda bird?

262
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,694
[MILLIONS yelling]

263
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,730
[MILLIONS G]
It's a falcon!

264
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,133
A falcon with a machine gun?!
Are you out of your mind?!

265
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,702
It's huge!

266
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,738
Hurry up and shoot it down!

267
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,048
[MILLIONS K]
Crap! The princess!

268
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,487
Oh, Pell! I can't
believe it's you!

269
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,524
It's very good to see
you, Princess Vivi.

270
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,759
How is my father?

271
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,093
He's doing well.

272
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,895
Your father and I both
read your letter,

273
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,998
and he sent me on ahead to
scout out the situation.

274
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,669
You mean, Karoo made
it safely to Alubarna?

275
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,604
He's all right?

276
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,073
That's right. You've got
quite a duck, you know.

277
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,575
Thank goodness!

278
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,744
Alabasta owes you a
great debt, Princess.

279
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:10,082
Thanks both to you and Igaram,
we know who we're fighting.

280
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,687
Now, if you'll please excuse me.

281
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,621
[MILLIONS L]
Pell!

282
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,023
[MILLIONS M]
You don't mean Pell the Falcon!

283
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,091
Oh, no way!

284
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,127
He's the strongest warrior
in the entire country!

285
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,198
The Bird Bird Fruit.
Model: The Falcon!

286
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,768
Just five types in the world
have the power of flight.

287
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,304
The power to which you
will now bear witness!

288
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,074
Shoot, you fools,
and don't stop!

289
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,776
[MILLIONS L]
He's gone!

290
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,948
[PELL]
Flying Talons!

291
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,659
Thank you, Pell!
I have to find everyone!

292
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,793
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
Really?

293
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,596
Don't you think you're getting
a bit ahead of yourself?

294
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,733
You've certainly been
a thorn in our side.

295
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,935
Miss All Sunday.

296
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,103
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
I'm just in time.

297
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,771
It looks like our
precious employees

298
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,307
are no longer of much use.

299
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,176
Sorry, Miss Vice President.

300
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,112
And who are you?

301
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,313
That was marvelous.

302
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,083
I've never seen anyone who
had the power of flight before.

303
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,954
Even so, do you think that
you're stronger than me?

304
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,290
Princess Vivi,
this arrogant girl,

305
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,626
is she one of those
threatening our homeland?

306
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,162
I'm simply here as a messenger
to invite the princess

307
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,964
to a little gathering
at our mansion.

308
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,266
If you have no objections.

309
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,636
Sorry, I'm afraid the princess
has a prior engagement.

310
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,371
I see.

311
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,107
[VIVI]
Stop screwing with us!

312
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,677
Now, really.

313
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,312
Do you think it's
proper for a princess

314
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,882
to use such coarse language,
dear Miss Wednesday?

315
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,355
Igaram. You killed him.

316
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,656
Igaram?

317
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,893
Ah, yes. Mr. 8, of course.

318
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,362
What's this? The one
who killed him was you?

319
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,031
Oh, come now, why are you
getting so worked up about it?

320
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,866
It's really no different
from what you did

321
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,969
to our employees just now.

322
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,971
Don't be childish.

323
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,340
[gasps]

324
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,016
[inaudible]

325
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,018
[PELL]
Damn you!

326
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:28,354
[MISS ALL SUNDAY chuckles]

327
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,857
Your bones will be
the sand of Alabasta!

328
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,995
Really? Tres fleurs!

329
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,231
[gasps]

330
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,668
[PELL groans]

331
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,744
Princess Vivi! You're alive!

332
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:52,911
[chuckles]

333
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,415
Oh, dear, did it look to you
as if I'd killed the girl?

334
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,250
[PELL]
Damn you, what did you do?

335
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,119
[MISS ALL SUNDAY] You ought
to lighten up a little.

336
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,454
I was only teasing you.

337
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,058
You have Devil Fruit powers,
it's the only explanation!

338
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,962
That's right. I ate the
Flower Flower Fruit.

339
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,265
The power to make body
parts bloom like flowers.

340
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,068
That is my ability.

341
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,937
Even with the power of flight,
you cannot escape my reach,

342
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,807
for my limbs can bloom anywhere.

343
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,443
Who's escaping?
I'm staying right here.

344
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,880
And taking vengeance
for the life of Igaram!

345
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,114
