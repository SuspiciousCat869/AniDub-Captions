00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.289
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.092
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.263
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:42.639
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.915
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.788
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:46.099
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.571
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:51.877
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.119
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.891
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.033
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.602
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:08.844
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.985

In order to defeat one of the

Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.467
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:23.006
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:25.611
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.682
Luffy had intended to
win a tournament that

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:29.920
promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:33.460
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:35.865
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:37.234
Keep heading up, okay?

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.806
It doesn't matter how
we get there, right?

--[LUFFY yells]

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:43.881
What are you doing?

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:45.483
That should work.

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:49.526
[GLADIUS]
Huh? Where did they go?

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.999
[KYROS] Well, that certainly
was effective, wasn't it?

00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:56.472
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Usopp and the Tontatta Tribe

have teamed up to defeat
Sugar and restore those

who have been
transformed into toys.

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:06.860
You're still going for this?

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:09.165
[LEO] The commander
placed his faith in us

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:11.570
to make Sugar pass out.

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:13.975
So I'm gonna carry out my duty!

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:15.344
Doce Fleurs!

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:16.279
[gasps]

00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:17.882
I don't know how long
I can hold her--

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.521
You need to put the
grape in her mouth now!

[LEO gasps]

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:46.105

think you could beat us?

[LUFFY] "A Liar!
Usoland on the Run!"

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:13.126
Whoa, what the hell's
going on over there?

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.297
They said we've got intruders.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.671
But we've also got Master
Trebol, so no big deal!

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:20.107
Those Poor bastards.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.781
Once you get on his bad side,
then you're as good as dead.

00:05:23.814 --> 00:05:27.187
[TREBOL chuckles]

00:05:28.757 --> 00:05:30.561
Would you guys
stay down already?

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.430
Jeez! Y'wanna die?

00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:48.497
I dropped my guard.

00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:51.402
I've been turned into a toy.

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:53.840
That means everyone
has forgotten about me.

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:59.351
[ROBIN]
Usopp! Where did you go?

00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:01.489
There's nothing
I can do anymore.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:04.028
It's all up to you now.

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:06.900
Whatever it takes,
you have to find a way!

If anyone gets to
kill him, it's me!

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:33.720
Don't be greedy!

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.739
Just give yourself up, Franky.

00:06:42.772 --> 00:06:45.343
Or we'll fire until you're dead!

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:47.281
You kidding me?

Why don't you shut the hell up?

Listen up, losers!

I'm gonna go nuts and
wreck this place all day long!

Don't ask me why!

[MARINES]
What?

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.122
[FRANKY] If I go underground
with these chumps chasing me,

00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:10.895
it's just gonna make things
worse for the Little People.

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:14.802
I'm leaving Operation S.O.P.
in your hands, bros.

[FRANKY] Do your thing,

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:30.366

[VIOLET gasps]

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:38.116
What's wrong? You're looking
a little bit pale.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:40.588
The Tontatta ran into Trebol.

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:42.323
All of them have been defeated.

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:44.763
Nothing but
destruction everywhere.

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:46.131
Oh no.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:48.704
One of my crewmates
should be with them right now.

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:51.976
Yes, he has a huge nose.

[KYROS]
Usoland!

00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:54.916
But it's not good.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.055
[LUFFY] Don't worry. He'll take
care of things. I promise.

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:59.458
Huh?

00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:02.932
If Usopp's there,
everything'll be all right.

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:09.679
It's funny.

00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:12.885
Why were they trying so hard
to make me eat this grape?

00:08:13.888 --> 00:08:16.325
Prob'ly poison, huh?

00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:18.831
It certainly smells terrible.

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:22.538
[LEO] I can't do it.
I can't fight any more.

00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:23.807
And don't worry!

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:28.216
If anything goes wrong, I'll
jump in and take over, okay?

[LEO]
Usoland...

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.660

What happened? Come back!

00:08:39.237 --> 00:08:41.877
I made it! Goodbye, Tontattas!

I'm sorry, but I wanna live!

[ROBIN] Usopp! Where did
you go? We need you!

00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:49.726
Oh, hey! How 'bout
I write a book

to tell future generations
how brave you are?

Good thing I'm alive, huh?

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:02.685
All of this is
Franky's fault, anyway!

00:09:02.718 --> 00:09:04.956
Why didn't he come here to help?

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:07.628
I won't let myself get killed

00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:10.934
just 'cause you guys think
I'm some legendary hero!

00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:15.812
Okay, I got away
from the bad guys,

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.984
but I still need to find a way
outta this stupid place!

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:22.190
Prob'ly can't worm my
way through that tunnel

00:09:22.223 --> 00:09:24.295
without them carrying me, huh?

00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:47.902
day after day at this port.

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:48.770
[TOY MAN D]
Hm?

00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:50.608
[TOY MAN E]
He's talking about us!

00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:52.678
[LEO] And he'll reunite
us with our friends

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:54.949
who are held captive
at the factory.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.653
He'll restore all the toys

00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:59.257
who are forced to
put on a happy face.

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.696
He'll dry the tears and
vanquish the darkness

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.968
they have buried
in their hearts.

00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:05.637
And the poor Big People,

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:07.508
who don't even know
what they've lost,

00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.113
will be reunited
with their loved ones.

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:12.150
And he'll save us, too.

00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:14.288
That's why I'm not afraid.

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:17.528
'Cause we have a
real hero on our side!

00:13:32.592 --> 00:13:35.163
What a waste of time.
Is that all you have to say?

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:36.231
[LEO gasps]

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:40.607
[USOPP] I don't need to
be a hero! No thank you!

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:43.045
I almost feel
sorry for you guys.

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.982
Your big hero lied to you.

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:46.251
[DWARVES]
What?

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:49.959
Too bad! Looks like you
saps got fooled again!

00:13:49.992 --> 00:13:51.495
[DWARF H]
You really think so?

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:52.998
Even though you're all beat up,

00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:55.904
this Usoland guy still
isn't coming to save you!

00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:57.908
That says it all, doesn't it?

00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.581
You think a real hero
would leave you like this?

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:02.618
Huh? Do you?

00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:06.727
But he told us he'd
help us if things got bad!

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.195
But he's not helping--

00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:11.135
I bet he's off somewhere
laughing at you right now!

00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:12.270
[DWARVES gasp]

00:14:12.303 --> 00:14:16.078
[TREBOL chuckles]
Since you guys are so honest,

00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:18.081
I'm sure you're not
making all this up.

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:21.221
Just like you said, I bet
there's some coward out there

00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:23.861
who told you he'd make
everything right somehow.

00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:25.664
Whoever the heck he is.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:29.337
But I also bet he chickened out
as soon as things looked bad,

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.709
so you might as well
give up hope!

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.012
[USOPP]
Sorry, but he's right!

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:34.181
If you want some advice,

00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:37.420
do like Usoland and
get the hell out of here!

00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:46.606
[laughing]

00:14:48.175 --> 00:14:50.379
[BOTH]
It can't be!

00:14:54.588 --> 00:14:55.289
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:14:55.322 --> 00:14:56.526
[TREBOL]
Huh?

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.141
[LEO]
Shut up.

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:05.911
He'll show you!

00:15:05.945 --> 00:15:10.587
Usoland will save us because
our hero doesn't lie!

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:31.027
[LEO] Usoland will save us
because our hero doesn't lie!

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:49.197
[LEO panting]

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:51.434
Do you know what he said?

00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:54.441
[USOPP] Believe it nor not,
I'm a descendant of Noland!

00:15:54.475 --> 00:15:57.615
[DWARVES]
Awesome!

00:15:57.648 --> 00:15:59.852
He knew about Noland.

00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:03.660
So when he tells us he'll save
the day, then we believe him!

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:06.966
And that means you're
gonna be sorry real soon!

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.471
That's right!

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:10.774
[DWARF O]
That's right!

00:16:10.807 --> 00:16:12.076
That's right!

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:13.012
That's right!

00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:14.381
He'll be here!

00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:16.385
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:22.665
[DWARVES yelling]

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:25.303
[LEO]
A hero would never lie to us!

00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:28.643
Because a hero will
always keep his word!

00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:33.219
[LEO] So you'd better
stop insulting Usoland,

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:36.024
or you're really gonna pay!

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:52.825
[panting]

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:54.460
[TREBOL]
Hmm?

00:16:57.167 --> 00:16:58.803
[TREBOL]
Hmm...

00:16:58.837 --> 00:17:03.947
[pants] What is it? If you're
gonna laugh, better do it now!

00:17:07.153 --> 00:17:11.462
Once Usoland gets here,
then you're gonna cry!

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:12.565
Pigya!

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:17.841
[laughs] He said "pigya"!
That's funny!

00:17:22.284 --> 00:17:26.726
So that's what you say
when you die, huh? "Pigya"!

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:27.661
[BOBOMBA]
Leo!

00:17:27.694 --> 00:17:30.366
[TREBOL laughs]

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:36.445
Listen. What Leo said was true.

00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:38.883
Usoland is on his way!

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:44.160
He'll carry out Operation S.O.P,
and he'll save all the Tontatta!

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:45.664
--[thud]
--Pigya!

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:49.505
[DWARF T]
Go ahead!

00:17:49.539 --> 00:17:50.306
Huh?

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.578
Be as cruel as you like!

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:55.316
But soon enough-- Pigya!

00:17:56.753 --> 00:17:57.955

Pigya!

00:17:58.857 --> 00:17:59.959
[DWARF V]
Pigya!

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:03.967
Come on. Give up already!

00:18:04.936 --> 00:18:06.338
[DWARF W]
Pigya!

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.114
When all hope seems lost,
then our hero will--

00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:12.217
[DWARVES]
Pigya!

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.158
[TREBOL laughing]
Then go ahead and call him!

00:18:16.191 --> 00:18:20.266
Let's see this hero of yours!

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.334

Stop it! Stop it!

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:43.211
Run away!

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.792
Enough already! I'm here!

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:54.702
[USOPP panting]

00:19:03.418 --> 00:19:04.488
It's Usoland!

00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:09.063
[DWARVES]
Usoland is here!

00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:13.840
I knew he'd save us.

00:19:14.976 --> 00:19:18.282
Usopp! You can do it!

00:19:18.315 --> 00:19:19.985
[USOPP] What the hell is
wrong with you?

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:22.958
Why do you all trust me
so much, you little idiots?

00:19:22.992 --> 00:19:24.628
You deserve to be crushed!

00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:26.064
[DWARVES]
What?!

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:29.370
[USOPP] Trebol was right!
Everything I told you was a lie!

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:31.041
[DWARVES]
What?!

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:33.814
In the first place,
my name's not Usoland!

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:36.686
And I'm not a
legendary hero, okay?

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.457
[DWARVES]
What?!

00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.730
[USOPP]
I'm from the Straw Hat crew.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:44.536
And my name is Usopp!

00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:47.306
The invincible sniper!

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:49.511
I'm a pirate!

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:51.616
[TOY MAN I]
He's from the Straw Hats?

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.786
[TOY MAN J]
What are they doing here?

00:20:05.409 --> 00:20:10.452
You're wrong. Why would you
say something like that?

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:20.072
[LEO] Even if you're a pirate,
you still can be a hero!

00:20:20.106 --> 00:20:24.147
A pirate's a pirate,
okay? Not a hero!

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:28.422
[USOPP]
I already told you I was lying!

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:31.763
Give it up! Don't make me
repeat myself!

00:20:31.796 --> 00:20:35.604
Stop having so much faith
in me--it's pointless!

00:20:35.637 --> 00:20:41.649
[DWARVES crying]

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:46.291
Wow, that's funny.

00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:48.964
You came all the way
back here just to say that?

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:52.136
To let 'em know that
you tricked them? [laughs]

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:53.372
[USOPP]
That's right.

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:57.146
Otherwise, those fools would
wait for me 'til they die!

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.000
[USOPP]
If that happened,

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:10.006
I wouldn't be able
to sleep at night.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:13.780
So I wanted to thank them for
believing in a guy like me.

00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:17.220
If I have to sacrifice
myself for them, that's fine!

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:19.691
That's much cooler
than running away!

00:21:22.397 --> 00:21:24.836
I'm Usopp, you hear me?

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.541
You better remember
my name, Tontattas!

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:30.079
If I die here, fighting for you,

00:21:30.113 --> 00:21:33.452
you gotta build a statue
of me next to Noland's!

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:35.389
You asked for a hero?

00:21:35.423 --> 00:21:36.458
Well, sit back and watch,

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:39.330
because I'm about to
become one right now!

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:44.541
[DWARVES gasp]

00:21:46.478 --> 00:21:48.850
Usopp, I...

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:51.188
[TOY MAN K]
Usopp, from the Straw Hats.

00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:53.593
[TOY MAN L] You think he's
actually gonna save us?

00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:55.830
After all this time?

00:21:58.168 --> 00:22:00.540
[laughs] Just give up.

00:22:00.573 --> 00:22:02.511
I'll take my chances, thanks.

00:22:02.545 --> 00:22:03.646
Kill him.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.315

00:22:15.804 --> 00:22:17.607
Shuriken!

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.279
[TREBOL]
Huh?

00:22:41.622 --> 00:22:45.029
[DWARVES cheer]

00:22:45.062 --> 00:22:46.866
How do you like that?

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:49.404
Now that's how
a legendary hero does it!

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:52.443
Let's hear it for the
sniper of the Straw Hats.

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.480
Captain Usopp!

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:56.919
[DWARVES]
Usoland, our hero!

00:22:56.953 --> 00:22:58.221
[USOPP]
No, Usopp!

00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:00.794
[DWARVES]
Usoland, our hero!

00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:02.697
[USOPP] Look, it's "Usopp,"
you little bastards!

00:23:02.731 --> 00:23:08.509
[DWARVES]
The legendary hero, Usoland!

00:23:13.887 --> 00:23:16.224
[NARRATOR] Years ago,
in the Kingdom of Dressrosa,

00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:19.932
there was a savage warrior who
was feared like a wild beast.

00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:23.372
His name was Kyros.

00:23:23.405 --> 00:23:25.610
When he crossed paths
with King Riku,

00:23:25.643 --> 00:23:29.685
the long-forgotten tale of a
legendary gladiator was born.

00:23:29.719 --> 00:23:31.387
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:35.029
"A Fateful Encounter!
Kyros and King Riku!"

00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:37.734
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
