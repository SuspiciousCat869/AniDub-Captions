1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between
the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good
time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing,
let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,844
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:45,515
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:50,553
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,457
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,827
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,263
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:03,700
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,669
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:09,572
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:13,276
[HOGBACK] Although most people
associate zombies with fear,

48
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,611
what if you think
of them in terms

49
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,980
of "someone who has
come back from the dead"?

50
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:20,383
Then it's a miracle!
The dream of all doctors!

51
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,551
Everyone in this world

52
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:24,454
has a loved one they'd like
to see come back to life!

53
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,955
Why, that's human nature!

54
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,558
And yet the medical
community condemns it.

55
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,926
Madness, they call it!

56
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,961
I'm trying to
play God, they say!

57
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,796
That's why I disappeared
from society,

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,732
so I could continue
my research in seclusion

59
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:38,268
on this island
without interruption!

60
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,068
Oh wow.

61
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,970
So I finally
found out the truth!

62
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:43,439
But just think-- If your
research here is a success,

63
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,275
then you're going to bring
happiness to thousands

64
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,277
of people all over the world!

65
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,613
As a doctor, myself, sir,
I'm behind you all the way!

66
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,948
How open minded!

67
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,484
Why, thank you, Doctor Chopper.

68
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,921
[CHOPPER] Even if you
acknowledge me as a doctor,

69
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,924
you won't get on my
good side, you big dummy!

70
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,794
[CHOPPER] C-Could I
have your autograph?

71
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:10,333
Oh, of course!
"To my dear, Doctor Chopper."

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,901
So, do you think
you could give me

73
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,770
a little tour of your lab later?

74
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:18,741
No one, and I mean no one,
can look inside my lab!

75
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,381
[LUFFY]
"Nami's in a Major Pinch!

76
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,750
The Zombie Mansion
and the Invisible Man!"

77
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,696
[USOPP] You're a big girl, Nami.

78
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,998
Can't you do this kind
of thing by yourself?

79
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,266
Usopp is right.

80
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:46,636
I could be picking Dr. Hogback's
super brilliant brain right now.

81
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,905
Yeah, yeah--just shut
up and keep walking.

82
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,827
I know I shouldn't,
but I wanna take a peek.

83
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,362
What? You do?

84
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,496
Chopper, I'm shocked!

85
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,499
I'm not talking about
Nami's butt, you silly human.

86
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,967
The thing I wanna take a peek at

87
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,670
is Dr. Hogback's
awesome laboratory.

88
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,006
Speak for yourself.
It's probably haunted.

89
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,107
Why do we have to sit out here?

90
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,976
Y'know, Nami, if you're
that afraid to take a shower

91
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,579
by your lonesome, maybe you
should skip it altogether!

92
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:30,880
Maybe some of us
don't wanna smell

93
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,483
like zombies any
longer than we have to!

94
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,417
Stinky-butts.

95
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,418
[USOPP] Oh yeah?

96
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:36,919
How would you know
what our butts smell like?

97
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:37,887
[CHOPPER] Yeah!

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,622
As soon as night
time hits, we're outta here.

99
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:40,923
[CHOPPER and USOPP] What?

100
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:43,559
At night? But it's scary
enough during the day!

101
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,466
We finally found a place where
nobody's trying to eat us!

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,768
But as soon as we step outside,

103
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,404
we're the main course
in a Straw Hat buffet!

104
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,538
That sounds painful,

105
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,840
so for the time being
I'm staying right where I am.

106
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,942
All we gotta do is wait
for Luffy to show up.

107
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,644
He'll save us.

108
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:02,512
[CHOPPER]
I think he's right, Nami.

109
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,047
This island's way
too creepy for us!

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,582
I'm not going through
that graveyard again!

111
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,018
We're not any
safer inside than out.

112
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:11,821
You did take a look at
this mansion, didn't you?

113
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:18,027
No. Whaddya mean?

114
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,696
[NAMI] If my hunch about
this place is correct,

115
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,133
we're right in the
middle of spook central.

116
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,968
There're more zombies
in this mansion

117
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,603
than you can shake a stick at.

118
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,640
Get me outta
here--I need my brains!

119
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,743
[NAMI] The one I'm worried
about is Dr. Hogback himself.

120
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:34,777
He's lying to us.

121
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,045
There's no doubt about it.

122
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,115
If he really has nothing to do
with the zombies on this island,

123
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,551
then you tell me why
they leave his place alone

124
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,786
and terrorize everything else.

125
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,057
Hey. Whaddya think
we should do, Chopper?

126
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,792
If what she's saying is true--

127
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,793
[CHOPPER thinking]
No way!

128
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,228
Is she saying that Dr. Hogback

129
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:54,464
is working with the zombies?

130
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,798
That's why we're
gonna make our escape

131
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,933
while we still have the chance.

132
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,735
When I'm finished here,
we make a break for the coast.

133
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,676
[MALE VOICE] You are
a very observant woman.

134
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,579
[NAMI] What? Usopp,
Chopper--what did you say?

135
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:10,279
[CHOPPER] Huh?

136
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,147
[USOPP] We didn't say anything.

137
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,014
[fart]

138
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,717
[USOPP] Hahaha!
But my butt just did!

139
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,152
[CHOPPER] Ew! Stinky!

140
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,454
[USOPP] Maybe you
should call me poo-sopp!

141
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:19,689
Huh?!

142
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,191
Huh?

143
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,830
Augh!

144
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,501
[NAMI] What the
hell is going on?

145
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,836
There isn't anybody
in here, is there?

146
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:38,107
[growls]

147
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,143
[NAMI] No way!

148
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,110
[MALE VOICE]
You're even prettier

149
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:42,945
than the lass on the ship.

150
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,114
Fear looks so good on you.

151
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,616
[NAMI] Who said that?

152
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,084
Usopp, Chopper, I--!

153
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:54,624
[MALE VOICE] Hush, my darling!
Or should I say, my bride!

154
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,092
Did you just now call for us?

155
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:00,530
I betcha you can smell
his fart in here, too, huh!

156
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,567
Auuuughhhh!!

157
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,735
[USOPP] Thank you very much!

158
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,703
Why are you thanking her?

159
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,640
[MALE VOICE] Damn them.

160
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:12,508
[NAMI] Help me, you idiots!

161
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,278
[MALE VOCIE]
Urk!!

162
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,446
What are you waiting for?

163
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,449
Save me already!
Something's in here!

164
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,788
[sniff, sniff]

165
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,923
Yeah-- I can smell it!

166
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,624
Sorry! Geez!

167
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,725
I'm not talking
about your fart!

168
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,927
It's a person!

169
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:32,528
Do something!

170
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,764
He's escaping out the window!

171
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,133
Great! Now I have to
shoot at an invisible target?

172
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,069
Special Attack, Gunpowder Star!

173
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:47,777
That fool. Is he doing it again?

174
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,980
[USOPP] Uh, what now?
Should I keep shooting?

175
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,082
[CHOPPER] Nah.
I don't smell anything.

176
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,817
Whatever it was, it's gone.

177
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,054
[NAMI] Then he must've escaped.

178
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:01,924
Oh, Nami!
You're not hurt, are you?

179
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:06,262
[NAMI] Well, whoever
it was, they heard it all.

180
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,863
Wait, who heard what?

181
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,932
I still don't
understand all this!

182
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,834
You sure it wasn't my fart?

183
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,237
He was in here the entire time.

184
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,347
An invisible man.

185
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,093
[FRANKY] Well this is no good.

186
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,096
Thanks to this gigantic spider
web we're dead in the water.

187
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,599
Uh, no pun intended.

188
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,935
[ZORO] Something's
not right about this.

189
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,003
[SANJI] It's not like
we'd be leaving, anyway.

190
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,873
We have to find Nami--and
the others too, I guess.

191
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,974
Let's head out.

192
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:40,413
[LUFFY] Hey! Zoro! Get your
butt down here already!

193
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,448
Even if meeting that
skeleton was a fluke,

194
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,850
the fact that the Thousand
Sunny and the Mini Merry

195
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,552
both got tangled up in this web

196
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,989
in the exact same spot
is pretty damn fishy.

197
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,692
Somebody went to a helluva lot
of trouble to make sure that

198
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,394
when we enter this place,
it's through the front gate,

199
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,697
and nowhere else.

200
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,965
[ZORO] Geez.

201
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,099
If they were gonna
make it that obvious,

202
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,602
they might as well have
laid out a welcome mat for us.

203
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,971
[LUFFY] Zoro, what are you
mumbling about up there?

204
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,539
You're gonna miss all the fun!

205
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,441
Are you seriously
about to walk into a trap

206
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,110
that's so damn obvious,
one even a headless zombie

207
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,145
would have the sense
to run away from?

208
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,280
Pretty much, yeah!

209
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,916
It's not like we have anything
better to do right now!

210
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:17,984
It'll be fun!

211
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,953
If you don't go, then
I'm taking your lunchbox!

212
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,790
Son of a-- Fine.

213
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,826
If I leave you alone, I'll
just have to rescue you later,

214
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,594
so I might as well just
save myself the trouble

215
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,062
and help you now.

216
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,101
[LUFFY] All right! Onward!

217
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,802
[SANJI] Sure took ya
long enough, moss head.

218
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,937
[ZORO] Aw, shut up.

219
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,044
[SANJI] Why's there suddenly
a staircase leading down?

220
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,145
[LUFFY] It's the only way in.

221
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's just go with the flow.

222
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,918
[LUFFY] Hey, I wonder if
these skeletons can poop, too.

223
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,521
Ruff!

224
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,622
Roof!

225
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,623
Rawr!

226
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,991
Yum!

227
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,962
Check it out,
everyone--it's Cerberus.

228
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,464
We are literally on the
path to hell right now.

229
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,999
Aw, I think it's kind of cute.

230
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,102
Are they a threat?
'Cause I'm feeling super.

231
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,671
Three heads are overkill.

232
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,439
Wonder what they taste like!

233
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,915
Hahahahaha!

234
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,652
Raff! Raff! Raff! Raff!

235
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,587
[ZORO] More like a
three-headed chicken.

236
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:30,956
Ruff!

237
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,290
Roof!

238
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,591
Rawr!

239
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,928
[ZORO] Weird how they got
all riled up outta nowhere.

240
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,597
[SANJI] Maybe one of
the heads remembered

241
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,565
that they're supposed
to be brave?

242
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,499
[ROBIN] That's possible.

243
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,867
Anyway--

244
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,570
[LUFFY] Nuh-uh! Dibs!

245
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,572
I'm gonna tame this bad boy!

246
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,207
[ZORO] Huh? You idiot!

247
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,709
You can't just tame it!

248
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,978
You do know it's not
a regular dog, yeah?

249
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,480
[LUFFY] How different can it be?

250
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,650
C'mon, who's a good boys? Shake!

251
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,588
[FRANKY] I assume we all
saw this moment coming?

252
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,223
[ROBIN chuckles]

253
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,960
[LUFFY] What big
strong teeth you have.

254
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,696
Now leggo of Uncle Luffy's head.

255
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,599
That's a good boys.
Easy does it.

256
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,068
Just like I said. Now sit!

257
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,673
[LUFFY] Roll over.

258
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,007
[SANJI] That just happened.

259
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,812
The poor thing's body
looks pretty beat up.

260
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,115
I'm surprised it can
still walk around like that.

261
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,584
I wonder what wise-ass
put this thing together,

262
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,619
cause whoever it was,
they can't tell the difference

263
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,521
between a dog head
and a fox head.

264
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,622
[chuckles]

265
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,591
If this is the first
creature we met on the island,

266
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,260
I can't wait to see what
other stuff we run into!

267
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,297
Cerberus seems pretty
down in the mouths.

268
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,066
C'mon Robin,
don't pity 'em.

269
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,734
It just makes
'em feel worse.

270
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,435
Leave 'em alone already.

271
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,904
Can you hear
me, Nami sweet?

272
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,776
Hello? Where are you,
my feisty truffle?

273
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,146
I'm all turned around.

274
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,716
It's like a maze full
o' creepy! Hey, wait up!

275
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,753
[SANJI] Okay, Nami!

276
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,758
When I say "sweetie,"
you say "here!" Sweetie?

277
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,293
I got a good
sense of direction,

278
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,061
but I can barely
tell my Strong Right

279
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,197
from my Coup de Boo around here.

280
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,799
With so much fog everywhere,

281
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,701
for all that we know we
might be going in circles.

282
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,705
Hey, Nami!

283
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,307
We would've had better luck

284
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,075
if ol' moss-head had
just stayed on the boat.

285
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,877
How is this my fault?

286
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,888
[FRANKY] Whoa.

287
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,325
A tree with
some geezer's face

288
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,261
is totally getting drunk
with a beat-up unicorn.

289
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,201
Just leave me alone
already, you crazy kid!

290
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,735
I'm making
a wish on you,

291
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,204
whether ya' like it or not!

292
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,007
[LUFFY] Gum Gum Bug Catcher!
[FRANKY] Strong Right!

293
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,879
Look at what I caught!

294
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,882
Please just
lemme go!

295
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,852
Oh, no! No! Stop shaking me!
I-- oh geez.

296
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:13,586
[ZORO] Hey, Luffy!

297
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,754
Whaddya wanna do
with these guys?

298
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:16,188
[SANJI] Don't tell me.

299
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,022
They're so cool!

300
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,224
How 'bout you
join my pirate crew?

301
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,759
Overruled, dumbass!

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,308
[MALE VOICE]
That was too close.

303
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,077
You're there, right, Absalom?

304
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,246
I can never tell.
What was all that ruckus?

305
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,249
Were you peeking in on
a bathing beauty again?

306
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,654
[ABSALOM] I'm on the
hunt for a bride, Hogback.

307
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,727
[ABSALOM] The redhead.
I quite fancy her.

308
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,363
I'll make her mine soon enough.

309
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,733
[HOGBACK] I hate to
burst your bubble,

310
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,168
but you shouldn't go
marrying the golden goose.

311
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,004
[ABSALOM] What's that
supposed to mean?

312
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,773
We have six guests
with bounties

313
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,342
on their heads this time,
including that girl you like.

314
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,912
Her captain's worth
300 million berries!

315
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,248
[ABSALOM] Three hundred million?

316
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,284
You don't seem
very worried, Perona.

317
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,752
If his bounty is that high,

318
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,087
we can only assume
he's one tough customer.

319
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,222
If you understand that,

320
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,957
then you'll know
you have to go all-out

321
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,260
on this one--and that
means no chasing skirts.

322
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:32,056
Looks like we'll have
ourselves a busy night tonight.

323
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,585
[USOPP] Invisible
men don't exist, Nami!

324
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,453
End of discussion!

325
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,421
[NAMI] Then who
accosted me back there?

326
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,557
Listen to me!
You just imagined it, okay?

327
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,961
I betcha clammy invisible hands
are a really common delusion!

328
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,929
I didn't imagine it, you ninny!

329
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,130
When you came in there,

330
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,099
you saw how it was holding
me off the ground, didn't you?

331
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,035
Yeah, I saw--I mean,
uh--Sorry, Nami!

332
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,903
Didn't see a thing!

333
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,438
Don't lie to me!

334
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,673
Ah! Trick question!
That's no fair!

335
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,509
As soon as I confess to
seeing you naked, I'm done for!

336
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,411
You're gonna slap me
into next week!

337
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,081
Ugh! I'm not trying to
play mind-games here!

338
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,148
The slapping can wait!

339
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,783
[USOPP] See? I knew it!

340
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
You wanna
know what I think?

341
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,786
Nothing I've seen on
this island has been real,

342
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,455
including you being naked!

343
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,523
The invisible man
was just a draft!

344
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,125
The ghosts were weird birds!

345
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,961
And the zombies were just
some, underground tribe!

346
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,096
[NAMI] Are you nuts?

347
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,330
[USOPP] Sure, we ran into
a fiddle-playing skeleton

348
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,900
with an afro who was brought
back to life by a devil fruit!

349
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,168
--But he was the exception!

350
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,738
No two devil fruits in
the world work the same!

351
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,741
If his fruit brought him back
to life, then he's the only one!

352
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,942
So, zombies and ghosts

353
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,511
and all the other horrible stuff
around here is impossible!

354
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,046
Right, Chopper?

355
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:55,547
Huh?

356
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,682
Come on, back me up!

357
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,651
The creatures we saw,
there's no natural explanation

358
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,553
for 'em, so they can't be real!

359
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,788
If you're looking at this

360
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,524
from a medical point of view,
then you're correct, Usopp.

361
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,994
There should be an
explanation for all this stuff.

362
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,798
Then again, if Dr. Hogback
thought his work on the island

363
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,968
was important enough to
leave his whole life behind,

364
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,870
maybe the natural
order of things

365
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,706
is turned upside
down on this island.

366
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,242
That is not what
I wanted to hear!

367
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,978
Maybe Hogback's not the
hero you think he is.

368
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,813
[CHOPPER] Doctor Hogback
is an amazing man,

369
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,081
and a medical titan!

370
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,649
I think he's incredible!

371
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,484
How come you think
the worst of him?

372
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,019
We don't know if he's
friends with those zombies!

373
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,888
You can't prove anything!

374
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,956
[NAMI] Prove?
Who needs proof,

375
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,492
when it's as plain as
the nose on Usopp's face?

376
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,961
Your idol is the Zombie King!

377
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,963
[USOPP] This is the
worst argument ever!

378
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,899
Just agree to disagree!

379
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,636
[CHOPPER] All right, let's go
ask Dr. Hogback what he thinks.

380
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,737
How's that sound?

381
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,508
That sounds horrible!

382
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,144
I wish Luffy would
hurry up and save us!

383
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,218
I know I don't have
anything to base it on yet,

384
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,053
but I don't trust that Hogback.

385
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,888
He gives me the creeps.

386
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,803
[NAMI] Pretty sure I know,
but I have to ask.

387
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,471
[USOPP] Huh?

388
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,239
[CHOPPER] What is it, Nami?

389
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,708
[NAMI] Isn't this the room
we just ate dinner in?

390
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,679
[USOPP] Yeah, so how come
it's pitch black in here?

391
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,913
[CHOPPER] What the--?

392
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,220
[USOPP] Uh. Cindry. You around?

393
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,789
[CHOPPER] Dr. Hogback,
can you hear me?

394
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,025
[NAMI] Yeah. We're done
with the bathroom. Thanks.

395
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,899
Anybody home?

396
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,245
Hello! Calling Dr. Hogback!

397
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,252
[HILDON] I'm afraid the doctor
and Cindry have called it a day!

398
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,889
[USOPP] Wait, Hildon?

399
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,056
Why, you little!

400
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,258
What's the big idea,

401
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,293
ditching our carriage in the
middle of a scary graveyard?

402
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,895
[HILDON] I feel bad about that.

403
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,631
Out of nowhere, I really
had to go to the bathroom.

404
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,765
You know how it is.

405
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,966
[NAMI] You're such a liar!

406
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,302
Admit it, weirdo--you're in
cahoots with those zombies!

407
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,672
How could you say such
awful things about poor Hildon?

408
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,013
But enough of
that unpleasantness.

409
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,048
If you'll follow me
to the guest rooms?

410
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:43,982
So if you don't turn us

411
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,652
into zombie chow at first,
try try again?

412
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,886
I don't trust
you any farther

413
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,688
than I can throw you, pudgy!

414
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,790
FYI, we're leaving
here right now,

415
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,825
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

416
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,927
[CHOPPER] Huh? Wait a minute!

417
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,763
Just let me straighten
things out with Dr. Hogback!

418
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,100
[FEMALE VOICE] Heh heh. Looks
like you bungled it, Hildon.

419
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,271
[CHOPPER] Who--
who said that? Hello?

420
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,907
You don't have
to be so mean to me.

421
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,376
I'll take them up
to their rooms, okay?

422
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,246
I think it's a
little late for that.

423
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,783
These three have noticed
far too much around here.

424
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,319
We can't risk them
telling anyone about us.

425
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,056
I-I don't believe it!

426
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,124
The painting!

427
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,927
It's holding a conversation
with us like it's people!

428
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,973
You're shaking like
leaves on a tree.

429
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:46,111
How adorable!
Wanna know a secret?

430
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,314
You're so cute I could
swallow you whole right now!

431
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,052
Let go of him!

432
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,821
That painting's
trying to eat Chopper!

433
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,756
I don't wanna be a still-life!

434
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,991
Chopper! I'm coming!

435
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,861
Attagirl, Nami! Keep pulling!

436
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,329
[NAMI] Get your butt
over here and help!

437
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,064
[USOPP] I'm moral support!

438
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,206
Heheheh!
It is not the painting

439
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,475
that you have to
worry about, but I,

440
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,542
the great Oinkchuck!

441
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,745
You fools will never
leave this room alive again,

442
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,913
so just get that
outta your head!

443
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,283
That mounted pig-head on
the wall is talking, too!

444
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,151
And it threw a sword!

445
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,419
I know you're busy, Nami,

446
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,023
but there's some pretty
threatening taxidermy back here!

447
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,995
[BEARSKIN RUG ZOMBIE]
Wait up, is that a sword?

448
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,166
Okay, who's the wise-guy
who stabbed the bearskin?

449
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,569
Auuugh!!

450
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,272
Nami was right! This mansion
is wall-to-wall zombies!

451
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,207
Even the decorations!

452
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,011
What're you doing?

453
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,350
Here it comes!

454
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,320
Eat this, you freaky undead rug!

455
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,089
Huh?

456
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,491
I can't believe you
threw a candle at me!

457
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,861
Seriously--who does
that? Hot, hot, hot!

458
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:10,996
We've got a fire
in the dining room!

459
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,797
The rug-manity!

460
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,098
That guy on the
chandelier did it!

461
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,032
Throw lit candles at him!

462
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,901
See how much he likes it!

463
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,169
Oh no ya don't!

464
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,305
Because I know your weakness,
foul minions of the underworld!

465
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,107
The power of Usopp
compels you!

466
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,214
[USOPP]
Take it!

467
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,187
Nami! Chopper!
Open the door!

468
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,189
We need to get outta here!

469
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,890
I don't care about Dr. Hogback!

470
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,892
I wanna leave!

471
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,495
Open it! My heart can't
take much more of this!

472
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,332
What are you doing, Nami?

473
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:50,969
You're kidding, right?

474
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,839
No, I'm not! We're really
trapped in here, Usopp!

475
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,774
Auugh!!

476
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,809
How dare you set me on fire?

477
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,878
You dumb little pyro!

478
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,982
You're not getting
away that easy!

479
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:10,789
No!

480
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,432
[USOPP] Chopper, I hate to ask,

481
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,968
but what's that on
the operating table?

482
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,269
[CHOPPER]
You really want to know?

483
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,404
[USOPP] Of course not!

484
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,839
But I mean,
is it what it looks like?

485
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,574
[CHOPPER] I'll tell you,
if you're ready.

486
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,977
[USOPP] No! Maybe just
give me a little hint.

487
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,544
[CHOPPER] It's a--

488
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,311
[USOPP] Ah! I'm scared!

489
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,113
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

490
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,448
"The Zombie's Secret!

491
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,017
Hogback's
Nightmarish Laboratory!"

492
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,253
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
