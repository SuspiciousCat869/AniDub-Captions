00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.016
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.638
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.911
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.152
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.191
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.501
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.136
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors of

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.469
the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:23.741
Their current objective
is to destroy

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:28.083
a man-made Devil Fruit Factory
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.988
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:33.561
with the Flame Flame
Fruit as a prize.

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:35.799
This guy's worth 77 million!

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:39.573

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:51.062
and passes along a
shocking revelation!

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:52.799
From the moment you
came here with Caesar,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.670
your crew's fate was sealed.

00:03:54.703 --> 00:03:58.009
Everything is following
Doflamingo's plan.

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:08.263
[VIOLET] Here's my memory
of Dressrosa this morning.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:09.866

Rebecca...

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:23.059
[TOY SOLDIER] I saw the list of
competitors in the coliseum.

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:27.368
I asked you not to enter.
Why did you do it?

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.573
[REBECCA]
Because...

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:34.248
Because I'll win!
You'll see! I promise!

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:42.131
When I do, please come back!
I just want you to stay with me!

00:04:42.164 --> 00:04:45.604

how do you expect to win?

after passing out in the forest

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:01.603

Everybody panic!

Don't try to run!
No funny business!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.298
I see. They've pinned
my body to the ground.

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.671
[LEO] You'll only hurt
yourself if you move.

00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:21.009
You Big People were up to
no good again, weren't you?

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:25.450
So this is a country where only
little people like you live?

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:29.124
It's 2:57. We're out of time.

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:56.713

for Caesar's handover--

Where'd you run off to?

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:23.499
And please tell me
you found the Factory.

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:25.938
That's the least
of our worries now!

We're not going anywhere.

Handing Caesar over
is part of the deal.

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:33.240
[SANJI] Yeah, if Doflamingo
actually resigned

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:35.276
from the Seven Warlords!

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:40.120
[SANJI] As it stands, you're
gonna be handing Caesar over

00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:42.558
for absolutely
nothing in return!

Please, Doflamingo!

you abdicate from the throne?

That's from Cipher Pol.

The government officials who
work under the World Nobles?

00:09:20.287 --> 00:09:22.024
What're they doing here?

00:09:22.057 --> 00:09:23.994
Citizens of Dressrosa.

I ask you to remain
calm and listen.

00:09:27.868 --> 00:09:29.237
We've journeyed to your island

00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:32.545
to address rumors concerning
Doflamingo's abdication

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:37.020
of the throne and retirement
from the Seven Warlords.

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:43.166
It was a false report.
Simply a mistake.

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:46.238
[CROWD chattering]

00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:49.111
Wait, then that means...

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.348
He's not quitting after all.

00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:53.554
Doflamingo's gonna
stay our king!

[CROWD cheering]

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:58.797
I could cry!

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.934
And to let the rest
of the world know,

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.741
we'll be releasing an extra
edition of the newspaper

00:10:03.774 --> 00:10:07.280
at three PM today,
setting the record straight.

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:09.886
But it must be kept
secret until then.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.492
No one outside Dressrosa
is to know.

00:10:13.526 --> 00:10:15.964
Our top priority
is for all nations

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:19.437
to keep living in peace,
as if nothing has happened.

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:27.287
What I saw... That wasn't
a dream, was it?

00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.227
It's real. It happened right
before you and your friends

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.667
came to this island.
Doflamingo is still King!

00:10:33.701 --> 00:10:37.407
[SANJI gasps] Why do I feel
like everything just got

00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:39.478
turned upside down?

00:10:39.512 --> 00:10:42.719
The World Government? I know
the Warlords are powerful,

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:46.560
but that kind of
influence is too much.

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:49.465
[VIOLET]
One would think so.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:53.105
Please. Go. I'm too
terrified of Doflamingo

00:10:53.138 --> 00:10:54.743
to try to leave
Dressrosa myself,

00:10:54.776 --> 00:10:58.516
but maybe you and your friends
can get away in time!

00:11:04.294 --> 00:11:08.803
You get all that?! You need to
leave the island right now!

00:11:22.798 --> 00:11:27.307
So the news about Doflamingo
was some kind of mistake.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.579
I find that hard
to believe, Saka.

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:32.016
The public being fooled
is one thing,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.657
but the Navy HQ was also
duped by a false report?

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:38.362
[AKAINU] I hate to admit it,
but that is the case.

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:40.366
I'm headed for Marie Jois.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.841
The Five Elders and I need to
speak at once on this matter.

00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:46.679
However, what's done is done.

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:50.386
You are to continue as planned
and keep onward to Trafalgar Law

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:53.661
and Doflamingo's
rendezvous point.

00:11:53.694 --> 00:11:55.664

[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

00:14:19.251 --> 00:14:21.155
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hey, Law!

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:24.294
I hate to admit it, but you've
managed to impress me!

00:14:24.327 --> 00:14:25.698
Must have taken some effort

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:29.672
to get an actual Navy
admiral to show up.

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:32.043
And since I'm no
longer a Warlord,

00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:34.348
I'm really shaking in my boots.

00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:37.087
[growls] You're a damn liar!

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.656
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:05.644
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:08.015 --> 00:15:10.219
Now! It's time!

00:15:10.252 --> 00:15:14.128
All competitors in Block C
have taken the stage--

00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:17.034
139 warriors in total!

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.272
It's our third battle
royale of the day!

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:23.580
Who will be the last one
standing in the ring?

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:26.886
About time!

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.696
We begin at the sound
of the bell!

00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:36.038
How'd you get down to the ring
without me seeing you?

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:38.375
Get back here!

00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:43.887
[GUARD A] Not so fast,
Cavendish! You're in Block D!

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.356
[GUARD B] Are you trying
to get kicked out?

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.227
Unhand me!

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.700
[GUARD C] Cut it out
or you'll be disqualified!

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:51.669
[ringing]

00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:53.640
[CROWD cheers]

[CAVENDISH yells]

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:59.886
Let's do this!

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:02.858
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:06.666

[yells]

00:16:11.441 --> 00:16:12.845
Yeah! Yeah!

00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:14.849
Send them flying!

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:18.455
[roars]

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:22.931
[COMPETITORS scream]

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.140
Hell yeah!

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:28.810
[laughs]

00:16:28.843 --> 00:16:30.814
I'm gonna send
every last one of you

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:32.585
down to swim with the fishes!

00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:34.922
[LUFFY yells]

00:16:37.226 --> 00:16:42.236
That's more like it!
Prepare to get crushed!

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.509
[yelling]

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:45.578

[COMPETITOR C chuckles]

00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:00.674
Huh? Where'd he go?

00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:02.778
Where'd ya get
a hammer that big?

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:05.517
Get off me!

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.757
Gum Gum... Pistol!

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.859
[COMPETITOR C groans]

00:17:09.892 --> 00:17:10.861
That little guy's arm

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:12.798
can stretch like it's
made outta rubber!

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:14.101
You don't think that's...

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:17.374
Only person I know
like that is Straw Hat!

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:18.443
Huh? Uh-oh.

00:17:18.476 --> 00:17:21.716
Let's see you worm
your way outta my axe!

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:22.585
Okay...

00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:24.689
[COMPETITOR B yelling]

00:17:24.722 --> 00:17:28.964
Just a totally a normal punch!

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:31.802
[groans]

00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:36.044
[sighs] Talk about
a close call!

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.648
Didn't you see what
just happened?

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.588
No one named Lucy could do that!
That guy's Straw Hat!

00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:42.123
[GUARD A]
Get him back!

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:44.562
[COMPETITOR L]
Hold still, ya pest!

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.365
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.433
[gasps]

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:48.603
[COMPETITOR M]
He did it again!

00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:51.441
Whoops. Nevermind.

00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:53.980
What the hell?

00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:56.051
Just for you... a normal kick!

00:17:56.084 --> 00:18:00.761
[COMPETITOR L groaning]

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:01.963
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:01.996 --> 00:18:04.067
Almost blew my cover there.

00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:06.939
Hey, that guy in the helmet
is quite the character!

00:18:06.972 --> 00:18:07.908
Do you know him?

00:18:07.942 --> 00:18:10.681
I've never seen him before.
Who is he?

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:11.683
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.352
Like I keep telling you,
that's Straw Hat!

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.590
[GUARD C]
Get back to the bleachers!

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:20.165
[CAVENDISH] Am I the only who's
not crazy?! That's Straw Hat!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.503
[COMPETITOR O]
You wouldn't think by looking,

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:22.704
but he's a powerhouse.

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:25.543
[COMPETITOR N]
I say we take care of him first.

00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:37.868
Ganging up on me, huh?

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:39.471
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:41.408
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:44.648
Get lost, shrimp!

00:18:46.285 --> 00:18:48.790
[COMPETITORS gasping]

00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:49.892
[COMPETITOR C growls]

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:50.994
[LUFFY gasping]

00:18:51.028 --> 00:18:53.466
There's no dodging
my hammer this time!

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.503
[yells]

00:18:56.505 --> 00:18:58.710
[CROWD cheers]

00:19:01.616 --> 00:19:04.154
[SPECTATORS gasping]

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:05.824
[WOMEN gasping]

00:19:08.262 --> 00:19:10.600
[screaming]

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.880
That did the trick!

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:17.982
[LUFFY]
You think so, huh?

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:18.951
Huh?!

00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:19.952
Boom!

00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:21.354
[COMPETITOR C yells]

00:19:21.387 --> 00:19:23.960
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.878
[CROWD cheers]

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:40.861
I'm... Uh...

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:43.332
[clears throat] ...very nimble.

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.069
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:47.707
[GYATS]
That was totally awesome!

00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:51.716
[COMPETITOR M]
You wouldn't think it,

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.887
but he's quite a fighter.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.193
Welp... Bring it!

00:19:57.226 --> 00:20:01.936
[NEWS COOS squawking]

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:05.778
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile...
The News Coos are about deliver

00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:09.618
a story that'll take the world
by surprise yet again.

00:20:11.421 --> 00:20:12.824
[MAN K]
An extra edition?

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:15.062
[MAN L] It must be a correction
or something.

00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:17.433
[CROWD]
What?!

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.471
[CROWD chattering]

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:21.909
What is this garbage?!

00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:26.251
[PIRATE A panting]
Captain, you need to see this!

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:27.453
What is it?

00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:29.625
It's big news about Doflamingo.

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:33.767
Uh? It was all a mistake?!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.637
This doesn't make any sense!

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.308
How could it be just an error?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.131
What is this, Doflamingo?

00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:08.970
You used the authority of the
World Government for some trick?

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:11.007
You spread a false story
and deceived people

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.744
all over the whole damned world,

00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:15.550
just to gain an advantage
over our small group?

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:19.959
[laughs] Haven't you
ever seen a magic show?

00:21:19.992 --> 00:21:22.130
The greatest illusions
are often pulled off

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:26.672
with the simplest
of tricks... Law.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:32.951
[DOFLAMINGO] Everyone always
says, "Well, that's ridiculous."

00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:35.824
But it's the rigidity of
the mind assuming no one

00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:37.327
would go to such lengths

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.299
that creates the blind
spot in humans.

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.936
Even if you thought of it,

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.742
there's no way you could
accomplish a scheme this size.

00:21:44.775 --> 00:21:46.044
[growls]

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:49.417
You're just a pirate!

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.023
It doesn't matter if you're
one of the Seven Warlords!

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:54.226
It doesn't even matter
that you're a king!

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.897
You don't have
that much influence

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.335
to make everyone believe
in an illusion.

00:21:58.369 --> 00:22:00.740
To lie to the whole world!

00:22:07.988 --> 00:22:09.758
That power doesn't exist.

00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:13.298
And there's no one alive
who could ever pull it off.

00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:17.774
That is... except for
the Celestial Dragons!

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:24.555
You don't know as much about
Joker's past as you should,

00:22:24.588 --> 00:22:28.261
and you're going to pay with
your life for that ignorance.

00:22:30.165 --> 00:22:33.874
[LAW]
Don't tell me. You're a...

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:37.514
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:22:41.689 --> 00:22:45.462
It's too complicated
to explain right now.

00:22:52.978 --> 00:22:57.186
You know why I went to
so much trouble, Law? Huh?

00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:58.488
[LAW gasps]

00:23:01.427 --> 00:23:06.605
No secret. I just really
wanted to kill you.

00:23:14.688 --> 00:23:16.893
[NARRATOR] Fujitora battles
with Doflamingo,

00:23:16.926 --> 00:23:18.362
and Law tries to stall them

00:23:18.395 --> 00:23:20.333
while waiting for
the Straw Hats.

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:23.138
When Fujitora draws
his sword to attack,

00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:25.744
both of the Warlords
are paralyzed with fear.

00:23:25.777 --> 00:23:27.814
The new admiral's might
is far greater

00:23:27.847 --> 00:23:29.651
than they could
have anticipated!

00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:31.355
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:35.630
"Shaking Heaven and Earth!
Admiral Fujitora's Power!"

00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:38.234
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
