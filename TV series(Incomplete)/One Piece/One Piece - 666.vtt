just you wait and see!

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.463
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.772
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.122
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:46.233
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.436
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.111
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.981
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.014 --> 00:02:56.386
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.070
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.952
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.528
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:20.901
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.406
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.012
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:27.816
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.254
that promised the Flame-Flame
fruit to the champion,

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:33.728
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.132
Now, he rushes to the
palace to save him.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.605
Meanwhile, beneath
Dressrosa, Usopp,

00:03:38.638 --> 00:03:40.374
and the Tontatta have
begun an operation

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.779
to take down Doflamingo.

[USOPP]
Y’know what? Fine!

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:52.899
I think I have plan!

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.237
Maybe I can pull this
off without fighting!

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.740
[USOPP]
All right, listen to Usoland!

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:59.044
I am taking command
of this operation!

00:03:59.078 --> 00:04:01.282
Our target is a
little girl, right?

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:03.019
So we’re not gonna fight her.

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:05.525
We’re gonna scare her
out of her wits!

00:04:05.558 --> 00:04:06.594
[DWARVES]
Yes, sir!

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:09.666
Uh... Actually, uh...

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.235
Lead the way, my brave friends!

[DWARVES cheer]

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.980
To the tower! Straight ahead!

Yeah!

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Huh?

00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:23.694
I’m seizing this lift!

[REBECCA whimpers]
I don’t want to fight!

00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:36.419
I don’t want to
practice anymore!

00:04:36.452 --> 00:04:39.660
Why can’t you
keep protecting me?

00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:44.435
I’m nothing but a toy,
beaten by the wind and rain.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:45.705
My body rusts.

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.007
[gasps]

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.379
What does a toy
like you even want?

00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:51.115
Why are you fighting us?

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.155
I’m here, because I
want a kingdom at peace,

00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:57.161
where my child can live happily!

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:01.670
To that end, I shall
fight for King Riku!

00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:05.377
Wha...? What just happened?
This is chaos!

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.448
I’m speechless, folks!

00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.486
Just like that, the
whole ring is out cold!

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.826
The match has ended
in an instant.

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:15.130
But there’s no winner
to speak of!

00:05:15.163 --> 00:05:17.134
Wait! Do you see that?

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:21.576
In the smoke, one
fighter begins to rise!

[LUFFY]
"“The End of the Match?!

A Surprising Result of Block D!"”

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:38.577
This is a baffling bombshell
to that all-out battle folks!

00:05:40.948 --> 00:05:43.486
[GYATS] It appears that
all 20-something remaining

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.627
brawlers have somehow
been knocked unconscious!

What is this twist of events?

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:51.335
I have never seen
anything like this

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:55.176
in the history of the Corrida
Colosseum, ladies and gentlemen!

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.792
What’s this? Do my
eyes deceive me?

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:04.294
I think I can
make out the figure

00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:06.700
of someone struggling
to stand up!

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.271
Could this potentially
be our winner?

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:14.015
[GYATS]
Is this the fighter responsible

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:16.151
for our shock and awe?

00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:27.007

[GYATS] Folks, we have seen
a spectacular showcase

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:08.056
of fan-favorites and
behemoth front-runners today.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.694
Yet shockingly, not
one remains standing!

00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:13.901
The contestant who will be
moving into the final round,

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.240
and our Corrida Battle
Tournament Block D Winner is...

00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:19.211
...unbelievably,
from the bloodline

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:22.752
of the disgraced King Riku,
the Prisoner Gladiator,

Yeah, screw you!

00:07:35.043 --> 00:07:37.916

somehow, Rebecca!

I don’t understand
how she did it.

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:50.842
All I noticed
was a cloud of dust,

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.612
then everyone went belly up.

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:55.050
[INMATE B] Do the details
really matter here, boys?

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.288

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:03.567
[WOMAN B] I can’t believe
this. She cheated!

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.370
She beat Cavendish? No way!

00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:06.940
I call shenanigans!

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:09.512
Admiral Orlumbus
wouldn’t lose to her!

00:08:13.185 --> 00:08:15.824
It was the slicing
winds of Rommel.

00:08:15.858 --> 00:08:17.361
[MARINE OFFICER A]
What’s that, sir?

00:08:17.394 --> 00:08:21.770
[BASTILLE] You don’t know?
It was quite the story.

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:25.911
Years ago, there was an odd
phenomenon tormenting Rommel.

[ROMMEL MAN A,

[screams]

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.881
[BASTILLE] It was said
that, late at night,

00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:47.120
terrorizing gusts of wind
would slice right through

00:08:47.154 --> 00:08:49.291
the kingdom’s innocent citizens.

00:08:49.324 --> 00:08:52.599
A Naval unit was dispatched
to investigate the issue.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.705
[ROMMEL MARINE A groans]

00:08:55.738 --> 00:08:58.376
[BASTILLE] But unfortunately,
these winds also claimed

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:01.448
the lives of a few
good men that day.

00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.023
[BASTILLE] However, we did
come to learn the cause

00:09:05.056 --> 00:09:07.127
of that dreadful cutting zephyr.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.633
Disturbingly, it was
a human responsible

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.368
for the callous attacks.

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:14.909
A man who referred
to himself as "“Hakuba."”

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:21.022
Regrettably, to this very day,
the fiend remains at large.

00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:23.827
Even after the incident
in Rommel Kingdom,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.770
there have been similar reports
of Hakuba in other regions.

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:31.442
And wherever Hakuba
has been sighted,

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:33.480
there just so happens
to be another pirate

00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:35.250
around at the same time.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.519

H-He’s a sleepwalker?

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:05.551
[BASTILLE]
Correct.

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:08.923
Hakuba only awakens while
Cavendish is fast asleep.

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:12.464
One could even refer to him
as a sort of alter-ego.

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:15.270
Although it’s technically
Hakuba who killed people,

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:16.840
Cavendish had no other choice

00:12:16.873 --> 00:12:19.779
but to become a pirate
as a consequence.

00:12:21.381 --> 00:12:23.520
I kinda feel bad
for the poor bastard.

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:25.691
[BASTILLE]
Don’t waste your pity on him!

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:28.864
The fool relishes in the
notoriety this brings him.

00:12:28.897 --> 00:12:31.368
Indulge in sympathy
and he might best you.

00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:33.472
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:36.712
[BASTILLE] He is already
a prodigy swordsman as is.

00:12:36.746 --> 00:12:40.521
But Hakuba’s skills could
put Cavendish’s to shame.

00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:42.959
Of course, he still
has to fall asleep

00:12:42.992 --> 00:12:45.196
to have his alter-ego appear.

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:47.568
So as you can imagine,
that doesn’t always play out

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:51.341
as planned, especially
in a battle royale.

00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:54.347
[snoring]

00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:56.520
There’s no way Rebecca won this!

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.321
Search her!

00:12:57.354 --> 00:12:58.890
I’m sure she has a pistol!

00:12:58.923 --> 00:13:00.360
[MAN F]
Just eliminate her!

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:02.164
She must’ve done something!

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:03.165
[groans]

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.036
Should we interfere?

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.172
Why would we?

00:13:06.205 --> 00:13:08.343
Well, to check Rebecca
for foul play.

00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:09.546
There’s no need to.

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:10.681
[ATTENDANT A]
Hm?

00:13:10.715 --> 00:13:13.119
We always scrutinize
her, even more so

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:16.091
than standard coliseum
regulations demand.

00:13:16.125 --> 00:13:18.429
Her equipment is perhaps
in the poorest condition

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:20.968
out of all the competitors.

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.639
Here in the Corrida Coliseum,

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:25.176
the winner is the winner,
no matter who it is.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.080
It’s not our job
to manipulate facts

00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:29.217
or spoil someone’s victory.

00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:33.560
Hot damn.

00:13:33.593 --> 00:13:35.932
She dominated that without
landing a single blow!

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:38.604
Always more than one
way to win a fight.

00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:39.772
Also,

00:13:39.806 --> 00:13:41.776
I don’t think it came
down to just luck either,

00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:45.049
as she was the only one to
see through Hakuba’s attacks.

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:46.653
Huh? Woah!

00:13:46.686 --> 00:13:48.724
That means you could
see all the slashes?

00:13:48.757 --> 00:13:51.362
I mean, of course you did,
since you’re you!

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.934
Anyway, no matter who
the winner may be,

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:56.706
I can’t let them get their
hands on the Flame-Flame Fruit.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.315
[Goodie! I was gettin' antsy!

00:14:01.348 --> 00:14:03.520
The finals are finally here!

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:06.559
Woo! [laughs]

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:16.746
[REBECCA]
I made it.

00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:55.189
Strong Right!

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:02.236
Huh? This again?

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:06.178
So cool!

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:08.951
He’s pretty much just
toying with that robot guy!

00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:10.053
[WOMAN C]
Come on, Señor!

00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:12.558
Just kick that trash
can’s ass already!

00:15:12.592 --> 00:15:13.593
Heh.

00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:15.864
I feel sorry for you
poor misguided dames.

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:19.037
No one bothered to teach you
how cool cyborgs can be!

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:32.564
[FRANKY] Take a peep
at this beautiful bod!

00:15:35.302 --> 00:15:37.273
Huh? What’s cool about that?

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.244
I don’t really get
what your deal is.

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:41.115
Please. Señor’s swagger stomps

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.052
your pedestrian looks
into the ground.

00:15:43.085 --> 00:15:44.555
[SEÑOR]
Shut your mouths.

00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.399
Try showing some
maturity for a change.

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:53.907
You should know better than to
mock a man for his appearance.

00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:56.044
[gasps] I messed up?

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:57.480
[SEÑOR]
That’s right.

00:15:57.514 --> 00:16:00.286
This pacifier here
in my mouth...

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:02.424
...and this cute pink bib...

00:16:02.457 --> 00:16:04.160
...are not accessories
I’m wearing

00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:06.632
to attract dime-
a-dozen bimbos.

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:12.611
This is my style.

00:16:12.644 --> 00:16:15.316
And it shows the world who I am.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.387
[BOTH gasp, sigh]

00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:19.124
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> sorry!

00:16:19.157 --> 00:16:20.259
Please forgive us!

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:22.731
I now see the error of our ways!

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:24.869
If I’m being honest with you,

00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:27.941
I do kind of dig
the whole cyborg vibe.

00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:32.952
[SEÑOR]
Ladies just don’t get it.

00:16:32.985 --> 00:16:35.055
Yeah? Go on.

00:16:35.089 --> 00:16:36.559
It’s a shame.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:45.476
Even if I respect you as a man,

00:16:45.511 --> 00:16:48.482
it’s my job to defeat
you as an enemy.

00:16:48.517 --> 00:16:51.087
[FRANKY]
Heh. Figured as much.

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.977
[DOFLAMINGO cackles]

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.147
See that, old man?

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:08.422
Your granddaughter sure is
lucky, if I do say so myself.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:10.392
[DOLDO grunts]

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:11.829
Who’d have guessed
that this little

00:17:11.862 --> 00:17:15.571
fighting tournament would
become a family affair?

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:18.610
Your majesty. What happened?

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.079
Willing to throw some elbows

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:22.551
for a bite of
devil fruit are we?

00:17:22.585 --> 00:17:25.456
Look how low the
mighty have fallen.

00:17:29.197 --> 00:17:31.201
[DOLDO]
Rebecca.

00:17:31.235 --> 00:17:32.738
You know something?

00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:34.541
I noticed that
your entire family

00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:36.979
has been acting
a bit off today.

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.919
And that includes sweet
little Violet’s betrayal.

00:17:39.953 --> 00:17:42.824
I don’t really believe
in coincidences.

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:46.699
So is it some
sort of anniversary?

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.875
I shouldn’t have
to explain my motive.

00:17:50.908 --> 00:17:53.346
But the actions you
took this morning...

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:55.885
[CP-0 AGENT A] We’ve journeyed
to your island to address rumors

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:58.624
concerning Doflamingo’s
abdication of the throne

00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:01.863
and retirement from
the Seven Warlords.

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:05.604
It was a false report.
Simply a mistake.

00:18:05.638 --> 00:18:08.342
When I had gotten word
that this small sliver

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.015
of ailing hope had been
too good to be true,

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:13.720
it reignited my passion to
want to stand up and fight

00:18:13.753 --> 00:18:16.693
for everything in the
kingdom once more.

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:18.930
That was all.

00:18:18.963 --> 00:18:22.003
Oh! [chuckles]

00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:23.507
Isn’t that heroic?

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.113
Still trying the earn the
people’s favor after so long.

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:29.952
But Viola must have
her own motivations.

00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:31.756
Unlike you, she would
never be caught

00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:34.762
acting on her emotions alone.

00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:38.468
A cunning and calculating
tramp, that one.

00:18:38.503 --> 00:18:41.175
Bet she’s weighing
her options now.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:43.913
She put so much stock
in this rookie.

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:45.717
But look what’s become of him.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.725
"“The Warlord."” "“Trafalgar Law."”

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:57.306
And that boy, who became
famous two years ago,

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.979
with the demon
blood in his veins.

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:02.283
Monkey D. Luffy.

00:19:04.154 --> 00:19:06.793
How pathetic. I imagine
the ignorant shrew

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:10.432
was banking on those two
"“heroes"” to strike me down cold.

00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:16.411
[DOFLAMINGO] Yet here’s Law,
barely clinging to life.

00:19:16.444 --> 00:19:19.752
And Straw Hat will never
get to leave the coliseum.

00:19:19.785 --> 00:19:22.858
Not as a human being, at least.

00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:24.695
As of right now, the only member

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:27.567
of the Straw Hat crew
who’s doing anything

00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:31.141
is that Cyborg Franky,
who’s reportedly attacking

00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:34.849
the Toy House
unassisted as we speak.

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.117
[FRANKY yells]

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.589
[gasps]

00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:45.470
[DOFLAMINGO] But I have
faith my family executives

00:19:45.504 --> 00:19:47.139
will take care of him.

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:53.252
His other allies:

00:19:53.285 --> 00:19:55.456
the Pirate Hunter Zoro,

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:57.661
Firefox Kin’emon,

00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:58.963
Nico Robin,

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:03.840
and Sniper King remain at large.

00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:06.478
But I highly doubt they
can get anywhere near

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:09.016
my underground factory.

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:13.425
[USOPP]
Hello, sir!

00:20:13.458 --> 00:20:14.862
Oh! New recruits?

00:20:14.896 --> 00:20:15.830
Sir!

00:20:15.864 --> 00:20:17.668
Good. We could
always use the help.

00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:19.538
Now, the job down here
is pretty easy.

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:21.008
You just keep all
these toys in line.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.477
Yeah, that’s it?

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.515
Seems simple enough, but I
really don’t know much about

00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:26.352
this stuff, so do you
think you could show me?

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:28.488
I learn better from example.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:37.039
[WICKA] There’s gonna
be a lift just up ahead!

00:20:48.028 --> 00:20:50.232
Okay, listen carefully!

00:20:50.265 --> 00:20:53.439
The palace where Doflamingo
is lurking, the Toy House,

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:55.342
and the trade port
where the SMILE factory

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:58.817
is located are all connected.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.854
[KIN’EMON] In other words,
infiltrating the palace

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:03.158
allows us to ingress
the other locations?

00:21:03.192 --> 00:21:04.695
[WICKA]
That’s right!

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.367
To get access to the factory,
you have to either pass through

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.672
the palace or enter
through the Toy House.

00:21:09.705 --> 00:21:11.876
The only other way inside
is through the trade port

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:14.480
in a secret tunnel that
my people and I dug.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.822
The most direct route
for us to take

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:19.424
is through the palace!

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:21.662
[KIN’EMON]
Very well. Understood!

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:24.902
Although, I am still in a state
of disbelief over such wee folk,

00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:27.239
in spite of one standing
before my very eyes.

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:29.210
Yeah, these guys
are great, huh?

00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:30.848
She’s like a toy!

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:32.449
[ZORO] There were hundreds
more of '‘em, too.

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:33.553
[LUFFY]
Oh, man!

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:35.289
I can’t wait to see that!

00:21:35.322 --> 00:21:37.661
[WICKA]
We don’t show ourselves often.

00:21:37.694 --> 00:21:39.230
We’re told that we shouldn’t.

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.134
We’re only supposed
to allow the Big People

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.171
of the Royal Family to see us.

00:21:43.205 --> 00:21:45.142
But you guys, the
Straw Hat Usolanders

00:21:45.175 --> 00:21:46.979
are the exception to that rule!

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:48.716
[KIN’EMON]
Uso... landers?

00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:51.556
[WICKA] There’s no time
to explain all the details now!

00:21:51.589 --> 00:21:54.595
Operation SOP is
already underway!

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:57.100
Okay! You can see it there!

00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:58.202
[gasps]

00:21:58.235 --> 00:21:59.672
[WICKA] That’s the lift
entrance to the palace

00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:01.642
I was telling you about.

00:22:06.351 --> 00:22:07.621
Oh, wow!

00:22:07.654 --> 00:22:10.092
We can ride it all the
way to the top, huh?

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:11.863
[WICKA] The only problem is,
to use the lift,

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:14.201
we have to show a pass
to a security guard.

00:22:14.234 --> 00:22:15.671
Let’s just kick his butt.

00:22:15.704 --> 00:22:18.475
[WICKA]
No! If you make a huge scene,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.048
it’ll just bring us
unnecessary attention!

00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:22.784
What’s so bad about that?

00:22:22.818 --> 00:22:24.287
You big bubblehead!

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.859
I’m having my doubts
about trusting you people!

00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:30.032
I’m stuck with a blockhead who
gets lost and some simpleton

00:22:30.066 --> 00:22:32.403
who wants to solve
everything with his fists!

00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:34.307
[ZORO]
What did you call me, you runt?

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.848
Somebody’s there.

00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:40.920
[WICKA gasps]
They already know we’re here!

00:22:44.193 --> 00:22:46.766
[LUFFY]
You want something?

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:48.536
Are you Straw Hat Luffy?

00:22:48.569 --> 00:22:49.738
Yeah. What’s up?

00:22:49.772 --> 00:22:51.074
[ZORO, KIN’EMON]
Don’t tell her!

00:22:51.107 --> 00:22:52.711
Come with me.

00:22:52.745 --> 00:22:56.017
I’m here to help guide
you into the palace.

00:22:56.051 --> 00:22:57.621
--[ZORO] Huh?
--[WICKA gasps]

00:22:57.654 --> 00:22:59.256
[KIN’EMON]
Huh?

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.528
[WICKA]
Huh?!

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.258
[NARRATOR] Luffy and the
others meet up with Violet

00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:18.529
to sneak their way
into the royal palace.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.669
Meanwhile, Fujitora’s true
intentions are revealed,

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:25.175
which in turn pits Navy admiral
against Warlord of the Sea.

00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:27.681
Now, an already
explosive situation

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:29.752
has become even more volatile!

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:31.655
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i>!

00:23:31.689 --> 00:23:35.863
"“The Admiral’s Decision!
Fujitora vs. Doflamingo!"”

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:38.435
I’m gonna be
King of the Pirates!
