00:02:34.976 --> 00:02:37.481
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.963
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.571
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:51.811
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:53.714
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:02.999
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:04.636
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:13.219
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:16.994
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:18.631
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.534
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:24.409
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:27.582
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:31.388
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.828
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:34.028 --> 00:03:35.898
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:38.170
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:41.408
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:45.518
I have to hold on to something!

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:49.225
Even a loser like me
has some dignity!

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:51.730
This will be my
final battle, Straw Hat!

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.869
See it through
to the end with me!

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:59.144
Sticky Launcher!

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.648
[groans]

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.326
[coughs]

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.566
[TREBOL laughs]
You just won't die, huh?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.171
Hey, hey. Hey, Law, c'mon!

00:04:12.304 --> 00:04:15.243
I think it's time to
call it quits, little buddy!

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:18.282
[panting]

00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:20.988
Take it easy, Law. Rest.

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:24.696
[panting]

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:28.303
I smell the sweet
aroma of victory.

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:30.674
Now fight! Don't make me wait!

00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:34.348
[GLADIUS]
Hmph! This should shut you up.

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:42.832
Oh no.

00:04:44.234 --> 00:04:47.040
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Gladius! Wait! You can't!

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.998
He's turned the whole
area into a bomb!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.837
[GLADIUS]
You know what happens next?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.643
You've been plotting this
for ages now, haven't you?

00:05:04.777 --> 00:05:08.383
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasping]

00:05:08.518 --> 00:05:10.386
Run for your lives!

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:12.792
Get away!

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:15.698
[CAVENDISH]
Hey, Bartolomeo!

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:17.300
Everything in the area
is about to blow!

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:18.804
Let me inside
your barrier, quick!

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:19.939
[BARTOLOMEO]
Not a chance.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:21.677
Why not?

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.647
If I open it, that'll put
me and Miss Robin in danger.

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.585
Also, enemies might sneak in.

00:05:25.718 --> 00:05:27.021
But I'm your ally!

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:28.724
You can't just leave me to die!

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:31.730
Gladius, sir! You're gonna
blow us up, too!

00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:35.571
[GLADIUS] You'll be fine.
You're professionals, after all.

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:38.109
Lemme in! Lemme in!

00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.881
[yells]

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:46.392
[GLADIUS]
Pop Rock Fest!

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:53.105
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:58.016
[LUFFY]
"A Strong Wind and a Surge!

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.688
Hakuba vs. Dellinger!"

00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:08.002
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.685
[GLADIUS]
Farewell, Cavendish.

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:21.095
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES screaming]

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.113
[sighs] If you'd been
stuck out there,

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:32.918
that woulda wiped
you out for sure.

00:06:35.858 --> 00:06:38.931
Exactly! So why'd you wait
until the last second?

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.734
I could've died!

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.538
How about a "thank you"?

00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:44.207
Is that any way to
act towards someone

00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:45.711
who just saved your life?

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:47.549
I've been out there
fighting all on my own!

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:48.917
Where's my thank you?

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.654
Bite me!

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.436
That's enough!
Let me outta here!

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.906
We need to win!

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.144
Really? You scream at me
and beg to come in

00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:03.814
and now you want out again?

00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:06.452
Can't stick around for
five minutes, just to be polite?

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:08.089
Show some manners!

00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:09.291
It's not your house!

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.962
We're fighting a battle, okay?

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:12.965
Time for offense!

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.472
[BARTOLOMEO] I'm not
letting you in next time!

00:07:16.607 --> 00:07:18.878
If I'm about to die,
you'd better!

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:21.716
You wanna win this fight or not?

00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:25.324
[CAVENDISH]
We'll settle this later!

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:26.860
My barrier, my rules.

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:29.231
So go find your own,
you little freeloader!

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:31.970
Crap! Miss Robin!

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.930
Okay, she's doing fine!
That's all that matters!

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.169
[ROBIN] I'll be there
soon, Rebecca! Stay safe!

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:53.781
[GLADIUS] You cunning
little tramp! How dare you!

00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:58.657
You've caused the Executives
enough trouble! This ends now!

00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:00.794
Catapult Pop!

00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:08.042
[BARTOLOMEO]
Barrier-bility...

00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:09.646
Racket!

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.616
[GLADIUS]
Huh?

00:08:14.957 --> 00:08:18.362
[laughs] The rest can suck it,

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:21.235
but you ain't laying a finger
on Miss Robin, pal!

00:08:21.369 --> 00:08:23.239
[GLADIUS] Dammit! I thought
I'd blown him up!

00:08:23.372 --> 00:08:25.611
[BARTOLOMEO] Take it to
the bank, Miss Robin!

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:28.517
I got your back!
Woohoohoohoo!

00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:31.322
[ROBIN]
Aw, Rooster. Thank you!

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:32.626
I can't believe it!

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.830
She just winked at me!

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:40.073
Aww yeah! That's the stuff!

00:08:40.207 --> 00:08:43.079
She was totally like
"Thanks, little Rooster.

00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:44.649
You can be my slave.

00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:46.285
I'll even step on you,
if you behave!" Right?

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:49.625
Okay, okay, sorry!
Gotta check yourself, Barto!

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.030
Keep that one in
the realm of fantasy!

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.432
Anyway, dude!

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.773
This is good stuff! I'm hyped!

00:08:59.512 --> 00:09:01.215
[CAVENDISH grunts]

00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:03.554
[GLADIUS] Huh? Cavendish? You
were behind the barrier, too?

00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:05.691
Unfortunately for you, Gladius!

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:07.428
Blade of Beauty!

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:08.564
[GLADIUS]
Brachium.

00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:10.667
Gladius, help!

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.952
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:22.123
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:29.739
[BARTOLOMEO yells]

00:09:29.872 --> 00:09:31.843
[GLADIUS, CAVENDISH]
Bartolomeo?

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.283
[BARTOLOMEO]
Barrier Bulls!

00:09:36.318 --> 00:09:39.692
It protects him, but it's
crushing all of us!

00:09:40.962 --> 00:09:42.331
Thanks, Miss Robin!

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:44.502
All it takes is one little wink

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:48.442
and my heart lights up
like an inferno!

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:50.313
[BARTOLOMEO yelling]

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:53.621
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:55.724
Okay, Bartolomeo, that's enough!

00:09:55.858 --> 00:09:57.460
You're gonna crush your ally!

00:09:57.595 --> 00:09:59.031
[BARTOLOMEO]
Sorry, Cabbage,

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.768
but there's a good reason
why I can't stop!

00:10:00.902 --> 00:10:02.404
And what might that be?

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:06.245
[BARTOLOMEO] Cuz I'm feelin'
super jazzed, baby!

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:07.915
Oh, that's lovely!

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:09.719
[BARTOLOMEO] I'm high as a kite!
Can't stop this train!

00:10:09.853 --> 00:10:12.023
[CAVENDISH] Well, hit the
emergency brake, moron!

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.227
[BARTOLOMEO]
No can do!

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:17.367
[GLADIUS]
Dellinger!

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.436
[DELLINGER]
Hm?

00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:21.576
[GLADIUS] Haven't you cleaned up
the second level yet?

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.047
Hey, Gladius! Going for a jog?

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.418
I'll join you in a sec, okay?

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.356
[GLADIUS]
All right, but make it quick!

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:31.028
Nico Robin is climbing to
the top and I can't stop her

00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:33.801
because my hands are full
with these two idiots!

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.403
[laughs] That's funny!

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:38.075
I can't wait to join the party!

00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:47.928
I said, "ignore me
at your own peril."

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.834
We're not finished yet!

00:10:50.968 --> 00:10:52.571
You don't know
how to take a hint,

00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:55.009
do you, Mister Longarm?

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.917
[DELLINGER] So you've been
hiding your extra joints

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.655
in those weird
shoulder thingies.

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:03.359
That's kinda creepy, really.

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.269
I know you're
a champion fighter,

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:10.507
but you've got a hole
in your stomach.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:12.077
Just drop dead already.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.886
[panting] This is a man's world.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.193
And that means I'm bound
by a sense of duty.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:23.833
To all those brave fighters
who fell before me.

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:28.309
[chuckles]

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:30.881
[DELLINGER laughs]

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.425
Ahh! How noble of you!

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.495
Cut the crap.

00:11:47.682 --> 00:11:49.184
[DELLINGER squeals]

00:11:55.564 --> 00:12:00.139
[DELLINGER laughs] You're
getting slow! What happened?

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:03.513
[laughing]

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:06.385
[groaning]

00:12:09.358 --> 00:12:15.904
[laughing]

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:23.385
[IDEO gasps]

00:12:29.933 --> 00:12:36.178
[IDEO panting]

00:12:38.149 --> 00:12:42.390
What a nuisance.
You're a stubborn one.

00:12:43.594 --> 00:12:44.862
[DELLINGER]
If you'd played dead,

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.200
I might have spared your life.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:51.208
What's the point of
standing up now, huh?

00:12:56.687 --> 00:12:58.591
I can still buy time at least.

00:12:58.724 --> 00:13:00.393
I hope that's enough.

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:02.330
All we have to do
is keep you busy

00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:07.173
until Straw Hat pounds
the tar outta Doflamingo.

00:13:08.644 --> 00:13:10.981
So beat me if you like.

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:12.785
But the only victory
that matters,

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.722
I'll win with my allies.

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:16.559
As a team!

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.971
[DELLINGER chuckles]

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.447
[DELLINGER] So instead of
calling it "defeat,"

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:32.524
you call it a "noble
sacrifice"? [laughs]

00:13:32.658 --> 00:13:34.562
Spoken like a true loser.

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:38.435
"Sense of duty"
is a shackle for the weak.

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:47.420
[IDEO gasps]

00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.585
[DELLINGER]
I'm no ordinary human, either.

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:25.897
The strength of a Fighting Fish
courses through every muscle.

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:54.822
I'm here, Gladius!

00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:58.764
You still need my help?
Where'd you go?

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:02.938
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:07.146
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES groan]

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:12.224
Gladius, hello?

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:15.897
[GLADIUS] Dellinger! Go back
down! It's too dangerous here!

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.236
There's a deadly enemy!

00:15:18.369 --> 00:15:20.073
That doesn't sound like you!

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:22.812
C'mon, I've seen the
competition, and if we team up,

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:25.216
there's nobody that can beat us!

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:27.153
[DELLINGER groans]

00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.104
[GLADIUS]
Dellinger!

00:16:03.326 --> 00:16:05.162
[GLADIUS]
Are you all right?

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.537
[DELLINGER]
Damn. What the hell just hit me?

00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:30.346
[groans] That was
too fast to follow.

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:45.577
[DELLINGER] You're like
a monster. But who are you?

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:06.719
Say something.

00:17:31.803 --> 00:17:34.842
[GLADIUS]
Damn it. He's finished.

00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:45.096
Whoa, jeez! What is
going on out there?

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.400
That little creep with the horns

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:50.272
and all the soldiers
totally ate it.

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:53.078
One dude did all of that?

00:17:56.686 --> 00:17:58.756
Oh man, that guy's
freaky as hell!

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.261
What is up with that face?

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:08.710
[BARTOLOMEO]
Wait, who is that?

00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:11.750
He's dressed like Cabbage,
but that can't be him.

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.253
I mean, can it?

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.744
Uh... Wait a sec.

00:18:25.878 --> 00:18:28.315
Something just like this
happened back at the coliseum,

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:30.520
during the D Block fight.

00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:37.199
[snoring]

00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:53.900
[GYATS]
I'm speechless, folks!

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:58.141
Just like that,
the whole ring is out cold!

00:19:18.148 --> 00:19:21.789
He cleared out those gladiators
in the blink of an eye.

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:28.101
[BARTOLOMEO] The clothes,
the hair, the sword.

00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:29.639
All Cavendish.

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:32.611
But that face is
somebody else-dish.

00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:38.455
[BARTOLOMEO] So what kinda
"dish" are we dealing with here?

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.402
[BARTOLOMEO shrieks]

00:19:45.537 --> 00:19:47.875
That was too fast to even see!

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.680
Holy crap, this guy's scary!

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:53.653
Hey, creepy-face! Who are you?

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:04.808
Cabbage? Is that you,
old buddy, old pal?

00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:30.627
[chuckles]

00:20:30.761 --> 00:20:37.741
[laughing]

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.680
Aw, too bad!

00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:44.254
You can't flip out on my ass
while I'm inside my barrier!

00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:48.262
It sucks to be you, huh? Huh?

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.165
You can zip around
as fast as you like,

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:52.036
but you're not getting in.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.273
Even if you ask nicely!

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:56.345
As long as I cross
my fingers like this,

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:57.881
I'm one hundred
percent creep-proof,

00:20:58.015 --> 00:21:00.352
freak-proof,
and homicidal maniac proof.

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:05.930
[BARTOLOMEO laughs]

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:11.341
[BARTOLOMEO]
No! I forgot a spot!

00:21:20.425 --> 00:21:22.363
What d'you wanna
kill me for, anyway?

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:26.539
If you're mad about me kicking
you out earlier, get over it!

00:21:33.719 --> 00:21:35.188
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:21:35.322 --> 00:21:37.995
What were you looking at
up there, you big weirdo?

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:40.065
Don't get any funny ideas, okay?

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:42.403
Hey, are you listening to me?

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:50.987
Oh no!

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.581
You come back here and fight me!

00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:08.488
Leave Miss Robin alone!

00:22:41.321 --> 00:22:42.524
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]
Sick move!

00:22:42.658 --> 00:22:44.461
That was wicked awesome!

00:22:44.595 --> 00:22:47.199
Thank goodness! I'm so relieved.

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.972
I was really scared for a sec!

00:22:53.947 --> 00:22:55.482
[ROBIN]
Why don't you calm down?

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.921
You're not going anywhere
on my watch.

00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:01.461
That's quite a wicked
look on your face.

00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:02.665
Poor Cabbage.

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.901
D'you need something?

00:23:14.788 --> 00:23:17.026
[NARRATOR] Halted on her ascent
to the Sunflower Field,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.163
Robin is vulnerable to
an attack from Gladius

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:20.833
and his deadly Rupture powers.

00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:23.205
But Bartolomeo's loyalty
to Luffy and his friends

00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:24.842
knows no bounds,

00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:27.279
and he is determined to protect
his beloved Miss Robin,

00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:29.284
even if it costs him his life.

00:23:29.417 --> 00:23:31.054
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:34.762
"Barrier-Barrier!
Homage Holy Fist Strikes!"

00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:38.034
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
