1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,044
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,347
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,283
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,117
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,053
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,654
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,591
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,460
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,128
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,630
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,967
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,570
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,974
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,043
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:18,581
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,488
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:27,624
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,559
After soaring
through the sky for hours,

56
00:03:29,592 --> 00:03:33,096
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women.

57
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,465
Captured by the
pirate empress Hancock,

58
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:38,234
Luffy was forced into
combat with her sisters,

59
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:40,303
Marigold and Sandersonia,

60
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,373
who had both eaten
different Snake-Snake Fruits.

61
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:45,742
Why, of all
the insolent... Mari!

62
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,644
This is your chance
to finish him off!

63
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:51,014
I can't. Don't you understand?

64
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:53,116
He isn't mocking you, sister.

65
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,619
That man is... protecting us.

66
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,687
You'd rather die

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,556
than let people see this
thing on your back, right?

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,302
[LUFFY]
Hancock's Confession!

69
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,004
The Sisters' Abhorrent Past!

70
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,103
Well? Is it all clear now?

71
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,641
[MARIGOLD]
Are you all right, Sonia?

72
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,415
[SANDERSONIA]
Please forgive us, Hancock!

73
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,085
[MARIGOLD] We lost and
were rescued by our enemy!

74
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:06,589
Okay. What now? You next?

75
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,332
We're done.

76
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,737
I'm not in the mood to fight.

77
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,138
Really?

78
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,574
Is she okay? No cracks?

79
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,811
[LUFFY] So...
you're gonna fix 'em, right?

80
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,747
Make 'em normal again?

81
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,717
[HANCOCK] What?

82
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,485
You heard me.

83
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,887
You can make
'em normal, right?

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,788
Can't you?

85
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,623
It's not like they
did anything wrong!

86
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,492
They just told the truth!

87
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,627
C'mon! Please?

88
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:49,732
[HANCOCK] Of course I can.

89
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,669
I can easily reverse the
effects if I choose to do so.

90
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,772
But...

91
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:56,839
[HANCOCK] To be clear,

92
00:05:56,873 --> 00:06:00,143
didn't you say you wanted
to go somewhere by ship?

93
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:00,943
[LUFFY] Yeah.

94
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,712
I gotta get back
and find my crew.

95
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:04,347
I see.

96
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,916
I have bad news.
You must decide.

97
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,318
I can either
return them to normal,

98
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,255
or help you to
reach your destination.

99
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,323
Choose one. Forget the other.

100
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,392
That's all I'm willing to do.

101
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,628
[chuckles]

102
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,531
Awful. Just awful.

103
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,835
[HANCOCK] You can't fool me.

104
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,905
[HANCOCK]
Now we'll see your true nature.

105
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:29,772
Good deal!

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,941
That's great!

107
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,409
Well, okay.

108
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,411
Go ahead and turn 'em back!

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,750
Seriously. Thank you!

110
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:49,092
That man...

111
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,595
He has such an
immensely powerful Haki,

112
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,766
but didn't hesitate
to save those he owes.

113
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,468
Incredible.

114
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,535
Sister.

115
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,937
Big sis?

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,109
[giggling]

117
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,276
[DAISY] It doesn't make sense.

118
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,346
The man defies us, then he
risks his life to protect us?

119
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,014
What a weirdo.

120
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,850
[RAN] There's no
question about that.

121
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,218
But unfortunately for him,

122
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,853
I doubt his kindness
will be enough

123
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:44,722
for the Snake Princess to
dismiss his rude behavior.

124
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,792
And it's even more unlikely
that she'll forgive the others.

125
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:52,797
[door creaks]

126
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,931
Hey, look, it's Margaret!

127
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:55,132
Sweetpea!

128
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,133
And Aphelandra!

129
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,336
Hey, everyone!
I was wondering where you went.

130
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:01,772
[NERINE] How wonderful!
She reversed the petrification!

131
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:02,940
I was so worried!

132
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:05,977
I just couldn't believe it
when you defended that man.

133
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,178
None of us could.

134
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:08,679
And then you were
turned to stone.

135
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:09,647
It was awful.

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,382
Stone? Huh?

137
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,086
What happened to us?

138
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,389
Most peculiar.
I have no recollection.

139
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,790
You can't remember a thing?

140
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:20,925
No.

141
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:25,429
I came to, and the man...
Well, he seemed so happy.

142
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,998
This is great!

143
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,366
I was really freaking out there!

144
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,168
I thought you guys
were gonna die!

145
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:32,803
[APHELANDRA]
Where did everyone go?

146
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:34,272
[SWEETPEA] Is the trial over?

147
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,874
Oh, hey, lady! Thanks!

148
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,810
[MARGARET] Snake Princess!

149
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:41,212
[SWEETPEA] We...

150
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:42,246
[APHELANDRA] Um...

151
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,349
[HANCOCK]
Continue to dedicate yourselves

152
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:47,785
to the protection of our nation.

153
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,361
That's... all I can remember.

154
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:58,529
[NERINE] It's fine!

155
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,164
[RAN] You're not the first
to have trouble remembering

156
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:01,899
after you've been
turned to stone.

157
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,267
Don't worry, I'll catch
you up on the details

158
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,835
of what happened later.

159
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:06,170
But what did happen?

160
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,372
And what did
she do with the man?

161
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:09,473
You really need to ask?

162
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,076
She just turned him to stone
and got on with her day.

163
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:13,945
[laughing]

164
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:16,080
Well I could be mistaken,

165
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:18,349
but it looked like they
took him to Kuja Castle.

166
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,383
What?!

167
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:25,122
[LUFFY] Hey, what'd
you say you want from me?

168
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,224
Ooh! Please tell me
you're gonna serve up

169
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,460
a big after-battle meal for us!

170
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:34,065
We're gonna get along
just fine if that's what it is!

171
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,334
So. What's the
best food around here?

172
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,069
Some kind of meat?

173
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:40,972
Just so you know,
I'm grateful for what you did.

174
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,073
Thank you.

175
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:43,975
Forget it!
It was nothin'! Really!

176
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,242
Feed me and we'll call it even.

177
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,345
If anyone had seen
what's on our backs,

178
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,980
it would've been the end of us.

179
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,983
We'd be cast out,
never to return.

180
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,250
[HANCOCK] You may enter.

181
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,887
[HANCOCK] I said come inside.

182
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,089
Where?

183
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,423
[HANCOCK] Behind the curtain.

184
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:01,993
[LUFFY] Oh! You've
got the food back there?

185
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,061
Here I co--!

186
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,063
Hey, where's the food?

187
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:09,000
And how come you
took your clothes off?

188
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,869
[HANCOCK] My! Astute
and charming, aren't you?

189
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,071
Look.

190
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,891
[HANCOCK] The mark on my back.

191
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,459
You... you said...

192
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,898
[HANCOCK] You said
that you'd seen it before.

193
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,966
I need to know.

194
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,834
Take a closer look.

195
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,505
Where have you seen it?

196
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:50,041
Do you know
what this mark means?

197
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,551
Answer me. Hurry up.

198
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:03,521
[HANCOCK]
This isn't pleasant, you know.

199
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,062
[LUFFY] It's not the same,

200
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:14,398
but it still reminds me
of the one I've seen before.

201
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:15,866
There's this friend of mine.

202
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,436
He's a fishman,
and his name is Hachi.

203
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,437
A fishman?

204
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,839
Yeah. He's got a mark
kind of like that one

205
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:24,075
on his forehead,
but it's different.

206
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,477
I've never seen one like yours.

207
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,513
[NYON] If he doesn't
nyo what it is, tell him.

208
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:30,381
Granny Nyon?

209
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:32,016
Why are you here?

210
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:33,951
Snake Princess. Be honest.

211
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,187
You nyo you can
trust him by nyow.

212
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,090
You've seen with your
own eyes he's a good man.

213
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,259
Go ahead, child.

214
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:45,396
Do not fear.
Your secret is safe.

215
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,267
You... You're the
nyotorious pirate

216
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,603
known as
Monkey D. Luffy, correct?

217
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:54,238
Yeah, that's me.

218
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:56,373
But how do you
know anything about me?

219
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:59,143
You do seem like a
decent enough young man,

220
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,178
despite your reputation.

221
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,114
Take a look at this newspaper.

222
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,583
Just a few days
before he arrived,

223
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:09,253
he caused an incident
on the Sabaody Archipelago,

224
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:11,922
an incident with
dire repercussions.

225
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:15,025
Nyot only did he oppose
the Celestial Dragons,

226
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,061
he punched one of them!

227
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:23,134
You... must be insane.

228
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,538
[NYON] By some miracle,

229
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:30,007
he was able to
escape the Central forces

230
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,943
they unleashed to capture him.

231
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,645
[NYON] And just as miraculous...

232
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:37,047
He traveled from
that faraway location

233
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:39,250
to here in a few short days.

234
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:43,420
Both of these things
are beyond my comprehension.

235
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:45,556
No. That's impossible.

236
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,358
I told you! Remember?

237
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,592
I got flung here.

238
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,628
Honestly! I don't
even know where we are.

239
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:52,630
I've never heard of it!

240
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:55,132
And I don't feel one bit bad

241
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,568
about knockin' out
that Celestial Dragon.

242
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,203
Does that newspaper even mention

243
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,106
what that bastard
did to my friend?

244
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,308
[HANCOCK] Then... it's true?

245
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,310
Are you telling me
that you actually struck

246
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:08,045
a Celestial Dragon?

247
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,316
[HANCOCK] I'm amazed.

248
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,519
I truly had no idea...

249
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,594
[HANCOCK] ...that there could
be such a wonderful fool

250
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,296
left in this world.

251
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,336
To challenge the World Nobles...

252
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,938
And risk your life...

253
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,975
You're just like he was.

254
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,445
[HANCOCK sobbing]

255
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,282
"He" who?

256
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,704
[HANCOCK] I will tell you
everything there is to know.

257
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:10,241
I can even tell you why your
fishman friend has that emblem.

258
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,676
And also what it means.

259
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,211
[LUFFY] Hachi's mark?

260
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,082
This brand is...

261
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:23,721
...the claw of the
Celestial Dragon.

262
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:26,590
The emblem of the World Nobles.

263
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:39,370
The Celestial Dragons brand it
upon those they take as slaves.

264
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:43,374
A marking to steal your humanity
and claim you as their property.

265
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:45,209
And they marked you?

266
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,148
You see,
the three of us were...

267
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,250
My sisters and I...

268
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,903
We were once slaves
of the World Nobles.

269
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,423
You guys were....
their slaves?

270
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,468
It happened when I
was twelve years old.

271
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,808
Okay! Starboard, clear!

272
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,477
Same here!
Port all clear, too!

273
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,579
[HANCOCK] Bow. All clear.

274
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,349
[HANCOCK] And visibility
is high. All is calm.

275
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,351
Careful you don't
fall in the ocean!

276
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,320
[laughing]

277
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,255
Don't make fun of me! Geez!

278
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,223
I'm a warrior now, aren't I?

279
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,325
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,327
Don't worry, we trust you.

281
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,263
[SANDERSONIA]
You tell 'em, Big Sis!

282
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,598
[MARIGOLD]
You know we believe in you!

283
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,402
You hungry?
I brought a snack out for you.

284
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,537
Hey, Hancock?

285
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,406
Sonia? Mari?
Where are you?!

286
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,607
[HANCOCK]
The three of us were abducted

287
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,376
from a Kuja pirate ship.

288
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,411
In broad daylight, no less.

289
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,048
And then we were sold.

290
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,088
From that point on,

291
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,057
we were submitted to
a hell we can never forget.

292
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,275
[HANCOCK] The first men
we ever encountered

293
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,245
were nothing but figures
of cruelty and horror.

294
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,118
Sonia! It'll be okay!

295
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,854
[HANCOCK] The memories
will always haunt us.

296
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,622
Hey, don't put
yourself through this!

297
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,290
I've heard enough! Really!

298
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,458
Please don't keep going!

299
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,160
It was all so awful.

300
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,362
Our world was
naught but despair.

301
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,164
And we prayed for
the mercy of death.

302
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,501
[LUFFY] Hey, c'mon.

303
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,505
But after four
years of that misery,

304
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,639
there came a night

305
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,742
that shocked even the
World Government to its core.

306
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,879
[HANCOCK] It was accepted
as a rule of the world

307
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,914
that no one would
ever dare challenge

308
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,883
the Celestial Dragons.

309
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,584
But on that fateful night,

310
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,586
there was a man
who scaled the Red Line

311
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,523
with his bare hands
and slipped into Marie Jois,

312
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,225
the holy land of the
Celestial Dragons.

313
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,932
This man

314
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,502
was an adventurer who
later led the Fishman Pirates.

315
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,404
Fisher Tiger.

316
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,539
He arrived
with the sole purpose

317
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,875
of releasing his fellow
fishmen who suffered as slaves.

318
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,544
He wreaked havoc
on the World Nobles

319
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,279
without reserve.

320
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,382
[RANDOM SLAVE 415A]
We're free! We're free!

321
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,318
[HANCOCK] Despite his
hatred for humans as a species,

322
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,287
he freed every one of us,

323
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,755
saving thousands of slaves

324
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,191
regardless of
who or what they were.

325
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,760
[HANCOCK] And so we fled,

326
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,329
more than willing to risk death.

327
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,280
[HANCOCK] We owe an
eternal debt to Fisher Tiger.

328
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,986
[HANCOCK] In the end,
Tiger unleashed an army.

329
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,589
Fishmen swarmed the oceans.

330
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,723
But they were cursed to wear

331
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,560
the Celestial Dragons'
mark of slavery.

332
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,262
[HANCOCK]
Tiger was relentlessly hunted

333
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,763
by the World Government.

334
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,332
So he brought
the fugitives together

335
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,534
to form the Pirates of the Sun

336
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,303
and sailed far
and wide across the seas.

337
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,442
[HANCOCK] In order to erase the
last trace of their bondage,

338
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,511
the former slaves
made a new brand

339
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,780
over the claw of
the Celestial Dragon...

340
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,752
...changing them
into a symbol of the sun.

341
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,887
[HANCOCK] There you have it.

342
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,457
By necessity, my brand
bears a similarity in design.

343
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,391
That's why you mistook it

344
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,894
for the symbol of
the Sun Pirates before.

345
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,695
Yeah. Guess so.

346
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,766
The mark on Hachi's
forehead does look like a sun.

347
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,700
Wait...

348
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,536
Does that mean Hachi
used to be a slave?

349
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,438
Possibly, although
not necessarily.

350
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,707
Not all of Tiger's
pirates were former slaves,

351
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,409
but they were all
branded with the symbol

352
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,011
to hide their comrades' past.

353
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,280
Which is why,
former slave or not,

354
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,681
it's safe to assume
that your friend

355
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,018
must've sailed with the
Sun Pirates at some point.

356
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,954
[NYON] Fisher Tiger has
been dead for some time nyow.

357
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,189
Upon his passing,

358
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,359
the Sun Pirates disbanded and
split into several factions.

359
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,697
Hold on.

360
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,365
When did you get
that wound on your head?

361
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,900
Huh? Oh, that.

362
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,869
Don't worry about it, okay?

363
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,339
[LUFFY] I knew he had a
pretty dark past, but jeez.

364
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,074
[MARIGOLD] Now that you
know the history of the mark,

365
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,878
I hope you can better
understand our position.

366
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,414
[LUFFY] Yeah. I think I get it.

367
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:16,381
[HANCOCK] It's sick--

368
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,817
The things that they
made us do as slaves.

369
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,986
They forced me to
eat the Love-Love Fruit.

370
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,555
And forced my sisters
to eat Snake-Snake Fruits

371
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,823
for their amusement.

372
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,794
Ironically, this allowed us to
hide our secret from the Kuja.

373
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,732
[HANCOCK] They praise our powers
because they misunderstand them.

374
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,868
But if you hadn't covered
Sandersonia's back in the arena,

375
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,571
the ugly truth
would be apparent to them.

376
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,612
I can't stand for
anyone to know of our past!

377
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,088
[HANCOCK] And I shall make
any sacrifice to ensure that!

378
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,930
Even if I must
deceive my own people,

379
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:07,766
I won't let
anyone control us again!

380
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,938
[HANCOCK]
I fear my own subjects.

381
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,706
I can't let anyone
come close to me,

382
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,042
or they might
know the truth.

383
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,712
[sobbing]

384
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,747
Sister...

385
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,418
Well on the
bright side of things,

386
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,553
it's been years
since you've displayed

387
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,657
even the most faint
affectation of an emotion.

388
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,658
But I welcome your tears

389
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,527
as they prove our sweet
Snake Princess' heart

390
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,796
has not frozen over.

391
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,432
You mock me.

392
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,868
You're the one who
left this nation behind!

393
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,870
That's neither here nor there!

394
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:48,040
Have you already forgotten
where you would be without me?

395
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,509
Yes, you escaped
the Celestial Dragons.

396
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,743
But you neglected to mention

397
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,513
that you didn't
know how to get home!

398
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,414
Tell me.

399
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,182
Would you have seen
Amazon Lily again

400
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,184
if I hadn't gone
to the outer seas?

401
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,419
You would
have starved to death

402
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:04,156
hiding in the cracks of the
Red Line if it wasn't for me!

403
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,558
[HANCOCK] A small kindness
you'll never let us forget.

404
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,426
What did you say?!

405
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,927
--Please, Granny.
--Please, Granny.

406
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,595
I've watched
over the three of you

407
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,531
as though you were
my own daughters!

408
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,666
Yes, yes, we know you have.

409
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,801
[NYON] And you have the gall

410
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,471
to dismiss all I've done
for you as a "small kindness"?

411
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,472
Put me down!

412
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,475
Mari! Sonia!

413
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,777
[HANCOCK] I suppose...

414
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,981
...you find me repulsive
now that you know I was a slave?

415
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,016
Huh?

416
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,561
C'mon. Don't tell
me you're serious.

417
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,495
Really.

418
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,897
I told you I hate
the Celestial Dragons.

419
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,940
[HANCOCK]
I've decided I like you.

420
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,007
You said that
there was somewhere

421
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,776
you needed to go, yes?

422
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,479
Well...
My ship's at your command.

423
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,513
Name the place.

424
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,515
You mean it?

425
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,784
[laughing]

426
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,261
[NARRATOR] When the Kuja
Pirates hold a banquet,

427
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,196
Luffy is the
center of attention.

428
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,499
Margaret rescues him
from a sea of admirers

429
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,134
and takes him to Granny Nyon.

430
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,703
She reveals troubling news
about his brother Ace,

431
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,705
and Luffy is forced
to make a decision

432
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,141
that will change the
course of his destiny.

433
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:30,809
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

434
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:34,045
Saving Ace!
The Next Stop: The Great Prison!

435
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,615
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
