[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.177 --> 00:02:37.715
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.622
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:45.832
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.336
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.852
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.891
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:03.199
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.232 --> 00:03:04.836
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.852
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.860
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.893 --> 00:03:18.864
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:21.202
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.440
Their current objective
is to destroy

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.914
a man-made Devil Fruit Factory
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:28.885
Soon, Luffy becomes sidetracked

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:32.959
by a tournament with the
Flame Flame Fruit as a prize.

00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:37.467
He's registered in the match for
Block C, which has just begun.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.144
No one can stop us now!

Meanwhile, back on the Sunny,

00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:50.528
Nami and the others have
a strange encounter.

00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:54.503
[BOTH gasping]

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:58.877

Okay, that is not normal!

00:04:25.363 --> 00:04:26.800
[ALL whimper]

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:28.904
What happened here?

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.709
Why is everything all funky?

00:04:47.742 --> 00:04:49.713
It's scary. I don't like it!

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:52.051
I'm more afraid of what
Franky'll do when he sees

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:53.487
the ship in this condition!

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.558

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:25.952
Oh, no! It looks like it
happened to the door, too!

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:27.822
Must be a Devil Fruit power!

00:05:27.856 --> 00:05:29.559
[NAMI]
What kinda fruit does that?

00:05:29.592 --> 00:05:31.730
[BROOK]
A "Bad Taste" fruit?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.280
[GIOLLA]
Oh my, this won't do.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:48.163
What a drab little boat this is!

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:50.467
You fools have no
artistic sense at all.

00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:51.837
What do you want with us?

00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:54.107
Don't interrupt me!

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.519
Unless you want to
compliment my figure!

00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:00.788
[BROOK, CHOPPER]
Not likely!

00:06:00.821 --> 00:06:03.460
[PIRATES grunting]

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:04.729
Show some respect!

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:07.702
Don't you knuckleheads know
who you're talkin' to here?

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:11.442
This is the one and only Giolla
from the Don Quixote Family!

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:18.289
[laughing]

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:20.828
They're with Don Quixote?

00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:23.601
My, oh my! Ohh...

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.071
I feel a stirring in my soul!

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:27.975
[cackles]

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.049

It's flooding my senses!

[GIOLLA grunting]

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:39.431
It's a vision of
freedom and beauty!

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.970
And I'll bring it to life!

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:43.072

[MOMONOSUKE gasping]

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.571
She made my face all stretchy!
I don't know much about art,

00:07:15.604 --> 00:07:18.443
but skeletons are not supposed
to look like this!

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:20.815
[ALL screaming]

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.453
This is so tacky!
What did you do to us?

00:07:23.486 --> 00:07:27.027
[laughs] I turned you
into masterpieces!

00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:29.431
But I can't expect
pedestrian fools like you

00:07:29.464 --> 00:07:31.335
to have an appreciation for art.

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:33.574
[cackles]

00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:35.945
You think this is good?
Turn us back!

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:37.582
Yeah! This stinks!

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:41.856
Sorry, dear.
I like you this way!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.392
But if you're that upset,

00:07:43.426 --> 00:07:45.631
I'm sure we can
work something out.

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.969
Let me see...
I'll change you all back

00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:51.643
if you hand over Momonosuke
and let me leave here unharmed.

00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:53.680
Don't worry about
a thing, Momo.

00:07:53.713 --> 00:07:55.751
We're not gonna
let her take you.

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:57.822
[GIOLLA]
I heard that!

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:00.928
Oh, my soul's stirring again!

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:02.899
Why, I've just been
inspired to make you all

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:04.101
even more beautiful!

00:08:04.135 --> 00:08:05.269
Not again!

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.708
If we get any more distorted,
we'll be nothing but

00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:09.813
blobs of paint!
What should we do?

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:11.683

[GIOLLA]
Huh?

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:20.501
[GIOLLA]
They're gone!

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.640
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
They went down that hatch!

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:24.943
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Should we follow them?

00:08:24.977 --> 00:08:28.917
Oh my, oh my!
They're craftier than I thought.

00:08:55.838 --> 00:08:59.311
[gasps] They won't get away
from me that easily!

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:00.480
How'd they do that?

00:09:00.515 --> 00:09:02.886
[GIOLLA] If there's one kind
of artist I can't stand,

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.221
it's an escape artist!

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:06.927
Get back here, or I'll make you
into stick figures this time!

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.430
We don't have to listen to you!

00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:10.300
It's not like you can
do anything to us

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.570
if you can't even reach us!

00:09:11.604 --> 00:09:12.939
Yeah, what she said!

00:09:12.972 --> 00:09:15.812
The joke's on you,
I'm already a stick figure!

00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.584
[screams] This will not do!

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:20.854
[BROOK] She's gettin' mad,
just as we planned!

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:23.727
[NAMI] Yeah. If she keeps using
that weird power of hers,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.497
the Sunny could end up
as a finger painting

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.401
or something else
ugly and useless!

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.106
I'm sure Franky will be
furious either way.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:32.143
Do you think that we can fix it?

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:35.449
I mean, did you see what
happened to the mens' dorm?

00:09:35.483 --> 00:09:37.889
It doesn't look good,
but for now,

00:09:37.922 --> 00:09:39.659
the best we can do
is try to stop her

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.361
from screwing it up even more.

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:43.534
That's why we have to
keep her attention out here,

00:09:43.567 --> 00:09:47.240
away from the Sunny! Come on.

00:09:47.273 --> 00:09:49.646
Huh? Why is she going that way?

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.783
Is something over there, or--?

00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:56.058
[GIOLLA growls]
This is so irritating!

00:09:57.728 --> 00:10:00.400
All right!
It's time to bring it up!

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.337

Wh-What is that?

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.965
It looks like
Doflamingo's submarine!

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:18.737
[NAMI] Ah. So that's how they
were able to get to us.

00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:21.677
[MOMONOSUKE] They must've been
hiding in the fog before.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.213
There's so many of them.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:25.718
Looks like we're totally
outnumbered here!

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.788
[GIOLLA] Well, don't just
sit there, you buffoons!

00:10:27.822 --> 00:10:29.859
Do something
before they get away!

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:34.201
I don't care how you do it,
just bring me Momonosuke!

My soul is being bombarded

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:48.797
by such marvelous artistic
visions today! I want to create!

Oh, no! She's doing it again!

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.942
Uhh! Excuse me! We're over here!

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:56.580
Yeah, aim this way!

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:59.317
Forget about the ship, we're
the ones you want, aren't we?

00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:06.633

No!

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:14.214

ourselves. Shall we?

It's too late!

00:11:30.213 --> 00:11:34.689
She'll ruin the Sunny for sure!
We're in big trouble!

Nice try, uncultured swine!

[GIOLLA cackles]

00:12:22.017 --> 00:12:23.520
[GIOLLA]
And without your vessel,

00:12:23.553 --> 00:12:26.024
you Straw Hats will have
to be very creative

00:12:26.058 --> 00:12:28.229
to find another way
out of Dressrosa!

00:12:28.262 --> 00:12:32.538
[GIOLLA laughing]

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:37.280
That's no good.

Please, Mr. Ricky.
We can't release you.

00:13:11.282 --> 00:13:13.085
You need treatment.

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:20.199
[RICKY grunts]
Treatment?

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.605
You let people kill each
other for an audience,

00:13:22.638 --> 00:13:23.807
what do you care if I get hurt?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.780
[gasps] Whoa!
Your head's bleeding!

00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:28.750
Take your helmet off
so I can take a look!

00:13:28.783 --> 00:13:30.988
[RICKY grunts]
Don't touch my helmet!

[RICKY groans, pants]

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.102
A-Are you all right, sir?
That looks painful.

00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:42.243
I told you,
I don't need your help.

00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:43.847
Open the damn gate!

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.851
We can't do that. I'm sorry.

00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:49.391
His wounds are pretty deep.
We'd better hold him still!

00:13:57.608 --> 00:13:58.710
[RICKY gasps]

00:14:08.496 --> 00:14:10.734
[inaudible]

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:16.245
Let them treat you.

00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:18.716
Your injuries are too serious.

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:29.906
[REBECCA]
Here.

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:31.442
[RICKY gasps]

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:32.578
[MEDIC A grunts]

00:14:32.612 --> 00:14:34.682
[RICKY]
Move! I can walk on my own!

00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:38.556
Uh, yes sir, take the stairs
down to the basement!

00:14:41.763 --> 00:14:45.436
[RICKY]
Rebecca. I'm sorry.

00:15:20.072 --> 00:15:23.880
[BELLAMY] Straw Hat is competing
as we speak, Diamante.

00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:24.883
[CROWD cheers]

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:27.320
[DIAMANTE]
After the match is fine, then.

00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:28.690
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.413
So Joker is ordering me
to murder Straw Hat now?

00:15:40.447 --> 00:15:42.818
Doffy's a generous leader.

00:15:42.852 --> 00:15:44.555
Even though you
lost the tournament,

00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:47.895
he's giving you one more
chance to redeem yourself.

00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:50.900
You should be happy
your task is so easy.

00:15:50.934 --> 00:15:54.742
Make sure he's taken care of
before the competition ends.

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:58.650
You can do it!
Keep hangin' in there!

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:01.388
[DIAMANTE] You do want
to become an executive

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.726
of the Family, don't you?

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:26.238
[BARTOLOMEO]
So, Cavendish,

00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:29.377
I heard you was tryin'
to off that Lucy guy.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.215
[CAVENDISH]
Bartolomeo, was it?

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:32.852
Well done making it this far,

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:36.058
but my business with Lucy
doesn't concern you.

00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:39.197
[BARTOLOMEO] That's where
you're wrong, pretty boy.

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:41.936
Lucy ain't yours to kill.

00:16:44.108 --> 00:16:45.878
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:49.017
Oh, I see. You want to.

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:54.294
He is hogging the limelight,
but no one else can touch him.

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:56.231
I'm going to kill him.

00:16:56.264 --> 00:16:58.637
And you're no
exception to that rule.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.341
You'll be in trouble if
you try to get in my way.

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:04.114
[laughs] Ooh, scary!

00:17:04.147 --> 00:17:08.455
Let's just say, he and I
have a connection.

00:17:08.488 --> 00:17:11.596
[GYATS] The contestants are
dropping like flies!

00:17:11.629 --> 00:17:14.936
The battle for Block C's
getting interesting!

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:19.411
It's a battle of both
power and fortitude!

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:22.117
Even though it would appear
to be anybody's game now,

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.352
ladies and gentlemen,

00:17:23.385 --> 00:17:25.489
you may notice that we
have one competitor

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:28.428
who literally stands out
from the crowd! Look!

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:30.399
[gasping]

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.728
[COMPETITOR A whimpers]

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:51.877
[yelps]

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:57.821
[COMPETITORS screaming]

00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:03.600
This warrior is part of the
new generation from Elbaf,

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:05.336
the Giant country!

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.977
A Pirate Mercenary who's as
fearsome as he is large!

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.218
Give it up for Hajrudin!

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:14.855
[MAN A]
He's huge!

00:18:14.888 --> 00:18:16.959
[CROWD mumuring]

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:21.368
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:32.858
You've gotta be 300 feet tall!
How is this a fair matchup?

00:18:32.892 --> 00:18:36.031
[HAJRUDIN] If you think
I'm unstoppable now...

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:48.289
...just wait till I get my hands
on that Flame-Flame fruit!

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.961
With that power, I can be...

00:18:50.994 --> 00:18:51.997
[COMPETITORS yelp]

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.432
...King of the Giants!

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.572
One punch and it's over!
Just like clockwork!

00:18:56.605 --> 00:18:59.578
At this rate, no one'll be
able to beat this guy!

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:02.985
Huh?! Well, actually. Maybe
I should take that back!

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:05.624
We've got our out-of-control
bull running loose

00:19:05.658 --> 00:19:09.898
in the arena, unfazed by
these tough contenders!

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:13.806
This wild beast once killed
21 death row prisoners

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.046
during a previous battle
in this very Colosseum!

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.083
A grim reaper through
and through,

00:19:19.117 --> 00:19:23.927
let's hear it for our favorite
rampaging beast, Brutal Bull!

00:19:23.961 --> 00:19:25.563
Yet despite his savagery,

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.569
one of our contestants seems
to have befriended him!

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:31.876
He's a mysterious newcomer,
but his strength and talent

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:35.851
makes him an instant
crowd favorite... Lucy!

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:40.259
[LUFFY]
Woo-hoo! Yeah, go, Moocy!

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:41.428
[LUFFY laughs]

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.902
[GYATS] Look at that guy go!
I'm rooting for him!

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:46.105
[GYATS laughs]

00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:47.708
[ATTENDANT A] I told you,
you have to be impartial!

00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:50.613
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:56.191
[groans]

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:04.675
Yeah, that's a good boy!
Run 'em over!

00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:07.046
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:10.386 --> 00:20:13.926
People love him without
even knowing who he is!

00:20:15.998 --> 00:20:17.901
He's something else.

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:21.609
[LUFFY laughs]
Faster, faster!

00:20:21.642 --> 00:20:23.580
[BULL grunts]

00:20:23.614 --> 00:20:26.050
[LUFFY]
Uh... Huh?

00:20:28.088 --> 00:20:29.190
Uhh...?

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:35.670
[gasps]

00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:38.142
No way, are they really
gonna fight that guy?

00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:39.978
You made a big mistake.

00:20:40.012 --> 00:20:41.916
[LUFFY]
Crap! Moocy, run! Go!

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.452
[BULL gasps]

00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:48.094
[MAN B]
No!

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.639
[MAN C]
The bull!

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:12.578
[WOMAN A]
And Lucy!

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:15.517
[GYATS]
This is a tragedy, folks!

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.835
[GYATS]
Talk about a mismatch!

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:28.610
The rookie from Elbaf
is victorious!

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:31.448
[HAJRUDIN yelling]

00:21:31.482 --> 00:21:33.853
Both of them in one swing.

00:21:33.887 --> 00:21:36.559
That's such a
terrible way to go.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:37.928
Sir, look over there!

00:21:37.962 --> 00:21:41.068
[GYATS]
I can't bear to-- Huh?

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:42.403
[gasps]

00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:50.285
[GYATS sputtering]

00:22:36.979 --> 00:22:37.714
[HAJRUDIN]
Hm?

00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:39.952
[LUFFY growling]

00:23:01.194 --> 00:23:05.002
[GYATS]
Lucy just felled the Giant!

00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:16.325
[NARRATOR] As the battle
for the Flame Flame Fruit

00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:21.034
turns white-hot, Lucy faces off
against Destruction Cannon Ideo,

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:23.506
a fighter with unusually
massive shoulders.

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.543
Known for his devastating
punches that can launch

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:27.213
even Giants into the air,

00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:29.718
Ideo poses a daunting
challenge for Lucy.

00:23:29.751 --> 00:23:31.689
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.722 --> 00:23:35.496
"Destruction Cannon Blasts!
Lucy in Trouble!"

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.168
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
