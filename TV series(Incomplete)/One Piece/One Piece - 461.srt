1
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,024
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,694
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,030
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:46,866
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,570
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,207
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,044
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,679
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,247
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,450
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,087
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,357
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,560
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:18,164
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,171
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,173
Luffy is headed to
Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,276
to rescue his brother,
Ace, from execution.

19
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,584
It's him.

20
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,258
Go figure. It's a surprise
attack. Whitebeard is no fool.

21
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,626
Oh, don't act like
you're so smart.

22
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,398
[MARINE M] There's a shadow
in the middle of the bay!

23
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,703
[SENGOKU] It's just as I feared.
Why didn't we plan for this?

24
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,139
They got their ships coated
to ambush us from underwater!

25
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,950
[MARINES gasping, whispering]

26
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,253
[MARINE O] It's Whitebeard's
ship, the Moby Dick!

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,868
[LUFFY]
"The Beginning of the War!

28
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,136
Ace and Whitebeard's Past!"

29
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,908
[MARINES gasp]

30
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,583
Seriously?

31
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,318
There are even more?

32
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,191
[MARINE A]
They're still surfacing!

33
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,827
Three more Whitebeard
Pirate ships!

34
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,101
[MARINE B]
They've infiltrated the bay!

35
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,605
Oh, holy crap.

36
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,110
It's First Division
Commander, Marco!

37
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:12,012
I'm counting 14 Commanders.

38
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,413
They're all here!

39
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:23,390
[clanking]

40
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,789
[WHITEBEARD laughing]

41
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,859
Been quite some time, Sengoku.

42
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,195
Whitebeard.

43
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,298
[WHITEBEARD]
We've got plenty to talk about.

44
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,201
Like you not killing my son.

45
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,035
[MARINES gasping]

46
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,974
[chuckling]

47
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,615
I can't believe we
let them get this close.

48
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,123
Well, we're through the gate.

49
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,425
Now, I'm just worried
your dear old dad

50
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,093
is gonna make an appearance.

51
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,629
I'm sure those Government
boys would love that.

52
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,896
Dad?

53
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,399
Dragon's not the type to sit
back while his son's killed.

54
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,569
When he's on a tear,
things get nasty.

55
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,570
Okay.

56
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,538
No, me and Ace, we don't
have the same dad.

57
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,273
Huh?

58
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,208
[LUFFY] You're right about
Dragon being my dad.

59
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,611
But not Ace. His
dad is Gold Roger.

60
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,514
[IVANKOV]
Huh?!

61
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,748
Yeah, pretty cool, huh?

62
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,017
It's a real shame he
never got to meet him.

63
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,253
He'd always get mad
when I talked about it.

64
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,421
[PRISONERS, IVANKOV]
Huh?

65
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,356
[LUFFY] Oh. That's
supposed to be a secret.

66
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,126
[PRISONERS, IVANKOV screaming]

67
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,600
[chuckling]

68
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,473
Sit tight for a second, Ace.

69
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,649
Father!

70
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,270
What did he do?

71
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,271
Did he crack air?

72
00:07:55,542 --> 00:08:00,547
[MARINES shouting]

73
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,185
It looks like he
set off a bomb!

74
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,720
Maybe so, but the water
level's too high!

75
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,022
A seaquake!

76
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,757
He's turning the ocean
waters against us!

77
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,793
[MARINE CC]
The other side, too!

78
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,562
I knew Whitebeard was
strong, but not like this!

79
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,580
[ACE]
I'm finally heading out!

80
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,620
Kick some butt, Ace! Take care!

81
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,256
Yeah. You got it. See ya!

82
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,558
[LUFFY]
Mh-hm.

83
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,261
In three years. And the next
time you and me see each other,

84
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,862
I'll be way stronger than you!

85
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,563
[ACE]
Sure!

86
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,765
[chuckling]

87
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,134
[LUFFY]
Bye, Ace!

88
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:05,512
It's about time we show
'em how it's done.

89
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,181
[ACE laughing]

90
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,417
That brat! I can't believe
he became a pirate!

91
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,820
[CREWMAN A] It's a pirate ship!
I've never seen their flag!

92
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,096
[MARINE E] He may be new,
but he's not wasting any time

93
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,964
at gaining notoriety.

94
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,200
"D"? Where is he from?

95
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,769
We haven't been able to
figure that out just yet,

96
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,872
but he's clearly got
the power of a Logia.

97
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,106
[WHITEBEARD chuckling]

98
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,508
[WHITEBEARD] Didn't expect
the terror of the Grand Line

99
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,744
to be such a dashing
young fellow.

100
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,681
Hear they offered him a Warlord
position, but he refused.

101
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,116
[WHITEBEARD] How long have
these boys been at this?

102
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,686
They're practically children.

103
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,089
They're rushing like
there's no tomorrow.

104
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,692
[SPADE PIRATE A] You sure
we wanna do this, Captain?

105
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,226
It's too late to complain now!

106
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,562
I've gotta see
Red-Haired Shanks.

107
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,533
[SHANKS]
Spade Pirates, huh?

108
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,670
So, you're the rookie
everyone's talking about.

109
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,438
Came to say hello?

110
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,174
Wait, it's not
what you're thinking.

111
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,675
My little brother
used to go on and on

112
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,011
about you saving his life
when he was young,

113
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,514
so I'm here to say thank you.

114
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:14,515
Luffy?

115
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,684
Hot damn. I didn't
know he had a brother.

116
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,354
Well, come on in,
I'm glad to meet ya!

117
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:23,023
Pop a squat and let's talk.

118
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,092
This calls for a banquet!

119
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,962
[PIRATES cheering]

120
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,464
Oh, yeah? Ha.

121
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:33,400
He's still dead set on becoming
the King of the Pirates, huh?

122
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,769
Pretty much all he
ever talks about.

123
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,774
Although, I feel
bad for the kid.

124
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,943
'Cause I'm the one who's
gonna be the next King.

125
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,578
Yeah? You think so, huh?

126
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,013
Well, the first
thing I've gotta do

127
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,450
is let the whole world know
that I mean business.

128
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,386
I see. And what's your plan?

129
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,921
I'm gonna defeat the most
powerful man in the world,

130
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,057
of course.

131
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,991
So, Whitebeard, then?

132
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:01,862
[ACE]
Hey, big guy,

133
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,198
I bet you can put me
in touch with Whitebeard.

134
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,867
You might be right, but
you'd still lose that bet.

135
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,169
Maybe I could introduce
you, but I won't.

136
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,371
Captain, do you
realize that's Jimbei?

137
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,573
Oh, yeah?

138
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,174
The Warlord.

139
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,077
Beating him might bring
us some prestige, then.

140
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,378
I'm my own pirate.

141
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,213
I'm not part of
Whitebeard's crew,

142
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,416
but I owe him one, so
let's see what you got.

143
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,798
Man. How long've they
been fighting? Five days?

144
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,233
You're both gonna die.
Knock it off.

145
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,614
[SPADE PIRATE A]
Ace, no!

146
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,523
[SPADE PIRATES gasping]

147
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,524
What the hell is that?

148
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,026
[WHITEBEARD]
I heard one of you boys

149
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,229
has made it your life's
mission to see me dead.

150
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,601
[WHITEBEARD
You wanna fight?

151
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,869
I'm here to grant your wish.

152
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,273
[SPADE PIRATE C]
It's the Whitebeard Pirates!

153
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:23,376
One of me is enough
for all of you.

154
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:34,221
[SPADE PIRATES screaming]

155
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:34,889
[ACE grunts]

156
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36,890
[ACE]
Flame Fence!

157
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,359
[SPADE PIRATE D]
Captain!

158
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,094
[SPADE PIRATE E]
Captain Ace, what're you doing?

159
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,796
Get outta here! Run, now!

160
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,831
Captain, no!

161
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,634
[WHITEBEARD]
What's the matter?

162
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:50,103
Don't tell me you're
getting cold feet.

163
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,774
My crew's not trying to
kill you. That's all me.

164
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,743
You let them go!

165
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,511
[WHITEBEARD]
Giving me orders?

166
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,312
You cocky punk.

167
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,215
[ACE yells]

168
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:29,042
So this's what he's made of.
My father's greatest rival.

169
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,682
[ACE]
I... I won't lose.

170
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:37,585
[chuckles]

171
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,553
Ya got some fight left.

172
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:45,859
Look, I'm not gonna kill
you today. All right?

173
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:46,994
Don't fight it.

174
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:49,062
You're too valuable to
die in a place like this.

175
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,332
Run wild with us and
our flag will be yours.

176
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,706
And I will call you my son.

177
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,942
[ACE]
Screw you, you old fart!

178
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,109
[thud]

179
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,728
[THATCH]
Hey!

180
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,264
I'm Whitebeard's Fourth
Division Commander.

181
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,335
The name's Thatch.

182
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:06,006
If you're gonna join us,
I'm a good friend to have.

183
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,707
Shut up!

184
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,878
[THATCH] Kinda grumpy
when ya wake up, huh?

185
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,681
Oh yeah. You're probably
wondering what happened.

186
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,716
Since you passed out, I mean.

187
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,518
Well, your crew
proved their loyalty

188
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,153
and came to get you back.

189
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,890
So, of course, we beat
the hell out of them.

190
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,326
But they're not dead.

191
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,561
They're all on the ship too.

192
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,663
Shouldn't I be in a
cell or something?

193
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,431
You don't even have
shackles on me.

194
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:34,768
Shackles? Nah, we don't
need 'em. Not on you.

195
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:42,008
[WHITEBEARD snoring]

196
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,159
C'mon, you know what time it is.

197
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,028
Yeah, we got people tryin'
to sleep on this ship!

198
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:07,868
[WHITEBEARD snoring]

199
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,308
[growls]

200
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,342
[ACE screams]

201
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:17,878
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE C]
Guys, he went overboard.

202
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,413
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE D]
I don't think he can swim.

203
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,249
Hey, someone fish him out.

204
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,817
[ACE screams]

205
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:28,021
He's been at it every day. Kid
must be stuffed with guts. Ha.

206
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,489
[ACE screaming]

207
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,991
Does that make 100?

208
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,659
I lost count.

209
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:38,698
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES
laughing, chattering]

210
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,479
[ACE]
Tell me.

211
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:55,081
Why does everyone on
this ship call him "Pops"?

212
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:02,422
You don't get it? Because
he calls us "sons."

213
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,024
None of us have any family left,

214
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:08,028
hell, the whole world hates
us, so it's nice, right?

215
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,731
I mean, I know it's just a word.

216
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,732
But it still feels nice.

217
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:21,975
[MARCO]
What's the deal?

218
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,644
Are you really gonna
keep on doing this

219
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:25,813
even after he's
spared your life?

220
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,714
'Cause you can't keep this up.

221
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,350
Hate to break it to ya,

222
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,420
but you're not strong
enough to kill him.

223
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,590
So you can either get off
this ship and start over...

224
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,359
...or you can stay here.

225
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:44,064
[MARCO] And wear the mark of
Whitebeard on your back.

226
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,337
[DOMA PIRATES gasp]

227
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,740
So you must be Doma.

228
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:58,412
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE AA]
Oh!

229
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,480
Hot damn, Ace did it again!

230
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,916
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE BB]
He got Doma and his crew

231
00:18:01,949 --> 00:18:03,984
to surrender all by himself!

232
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:06,519
You guys want me to
command the second division?

233
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,523
The post has been open for
a long time, so just take it.

234
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,524
Yeah, nobody's gonna complain.

235
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:16,029
You're part of the
original crew, right?

236
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,832
This doesn't bother you at all?

237
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,666
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

238
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,836
Nah, not in the slightest.

239
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,871
I got no ambitions
for that sorta thing.

240
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,407
Do it for us.

241
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,409
"Commander Ace."

242
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,399
[knocking]

243
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:53,333
[WHITEBEARD]
Hm?

244
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,735
[ACE]
Hey, Pops. You got a minute?

245
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,541
[WHITEBEARD chuckles]

246
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:04,878
Well, damn. I'm surprised.
I had no idea.

247
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:11,151
Though to be honest, you don't
take after old Roger, much.

248
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:14,989
He was your enemy. Don't
you wanna kick me out?

249
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,156
The look on your face,

250
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,325
I thought you had something
important to tell me,

251
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,828
but I couldn't think of
anything more trivial.

252
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,063
I don't care where
the hell you came from.

253
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,832
We're all children of the sea.

254
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:31,004
[laughing]

255
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:35,809
From this day forward,

256
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,312
Ace will be our Second
Division Commander!

257
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,382
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES cheering]

258
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,650
[MARCO]
Ha.

259
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:47,020
Don't look so dazed, buddy,
you're a star. Now eat.

260
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:01,935
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE EE]
Here.

261
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,210
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES laughing]

262
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,378
Slow down.

263
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,881
The food's not going anywhere,
buddy, I promise ya.

264
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,817
Besides, the banquet
today's in your honor!

265
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,487
[ACE snoring]

266
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,089
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES]
He fell asleep!

267
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,890
[WHITEBEARD]
Hm?

268
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:25,159
[chuckles]

269
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,660
Whitebeard's sure on a roll.

270
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,862
He just picked up
another strong rookie.

271
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,531
I heard this new kid
can breathe fire!

272
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:41,608
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE CC]
Here comes the Second Division!

273
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,079
Ace!

274
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,380
You okay there, Thatch?

275
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,515
Yep. I am now.

276
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,889
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE DD] Bet
they'll raise your bounty again.

277
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:56,924
[ACE]
Possibly.

278
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,493
[THATCH] Ace, take a
look at what I found.

279
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,996
Whoa, uh, is that a Devil Fruit?

280
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,196
[THATCH]
I think so.

281
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,198
But I don't know
what type it is yet.

282
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:25,152
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE J] Please,
Ace, come on! Just calm down!

283
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:27,721
Pops said he's gonna make
an exception with this one!

284
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,990
He doesn't want you
goin' after Teach!

285
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,993
Let me go! I'm his
Commander, aren't I?

286
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,095
If I don't bring Teach
to justice for this,

287
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,065
how can Thatch's
spirit ever rest?

288
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,132
Ace.

289
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:45,072
[WHITEBEARD] I know how
you feel, but let it go.

290
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:48,475
I've got a bad feeling
about this one.

291
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:51,311
The man killed his own
crewmate and ran away!

292
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,214
You've treated him like
your son for decades now,

293
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,950
then he turns and
spits in your face!

294
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,555
He's disgraced my
father's good name.

295
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,757
I can't allow that.

296
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,293
I'll take care
of this on my own!

297
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:15,302
Hey, hold on!
Come back here, Ace!

298
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:20,106
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES shouting]

299
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:31,919
Is the quake over?

300
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,854
Is that his power?
'Cause holy crap!

301
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:40,160
[ACE]
Pops...

302
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,195
Everyone else, too.

303
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:47,501
I ignored your advice
and took off on my own.

304
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,071
Why the hell didn't you
just give up on me?

305
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:52,839
Every bit of this
is my own damn fault!

306
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,177
No.

00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:02,515
It was I who drove
you to this...

have assembled at last.

Whitebeard unleashes a tsunami

that is set to swallow
every last Marine

313
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,702
and turn Navy
Headquarters upside down.

314
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,905
The tides of a
new era are falling

315
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:28,074
and the winner of this
battle will rule the waves.

316
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,677
[LUFFY]

Destroy the World!
