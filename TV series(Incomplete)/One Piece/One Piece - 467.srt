1
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,091
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,828
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,130
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,933
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,636
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,238
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,341
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,144
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,979
they capture the
unwanted attention of

10
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,413
the World Government,

11
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,884
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,953
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,424
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,460
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:18,632
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,570
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

17
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,206
Luffy has rushed to Marineford
and straight into

18
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,376
the epic battle between the Navy
and the Whitebeard pirates.

19
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,278
But will his new
alliance be enough

20
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,680
to save Ace from execution?

21
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,749
[MARINE A] Attention,
all ships and soldiers!

22
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,450
Once all soldiers are in place,

23
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,019
we will move the
schedule forward

24
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,554
and execute Ace immediately.

25
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:41,655
That is all. Click.

26
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,189
[gasping]

27
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,490
[ALL]
Huh?

28
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,459
Luffy, no.

29
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,093
Let's move!

30
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,562
[LUFFY yells]

31
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,332
[IVANKOV, BUGGY]
Let's go!

32
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,036
Hey, wait a minute!

33
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,606
[ALL]
No! That's the wrong side!

34
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,807
[ALL scream]

35
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,292
[inhales]

36
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:27,467
Ace! I'm here!

37
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:30,704
[MARINE D]
Hey, is that who I think it is?

38
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,139
It's Crocodile!

39
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,941
And he's not the
only one, either!

40
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,442
Just take a look at that lineup!

41
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,645
A who's who on both sides!

42
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,313
All the big names are here!

43
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:43,183
[laughs] The world can't
handle this madness!

44
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,986
Hey Ace! Sit tight, okay?

45
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,389
'Cause we're gonna
get you outta here!

46
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,858
Hey, Garp!

47
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,160
Your family's messing
things up again!

48
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:54,828
Luffy, no!

49
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,732
[AKAINU] The grandson of our
very own Marine hero Garp,

50
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:01,501
and the son of the
revolutionary Dragon.

51
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,805
I'll make that boy
regret the day

52
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,973
he decided to become a pirate!

53
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,643
Huh? Where'd Croco-Boy go?

54
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,045
[BUGGY] Huh? I guess
the sucker chickened out

55
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,214
and left us high an' dry.

56
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,282
Wait, there he is!

57
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,087
Dammit, you're supposed
to wait for me!

58
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:23,257
[CROCODILE]
Long time no see, old man.

59
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,492
[WHITEBEARD]
You never learn.

60
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,760
[CROCODILE laughs]

61
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,028
[CROCODILE grunts]

62
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,774
You know, there's only
one reason why I'm here.

63
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,244
If you wanna save your brother
so bad, stay out of my way.

64
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,813
I'm killing Whitebeard
and you can't stop me!

65
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,383
So that old guy is
Whitebeard. I thought so.

66
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,151
Just stay away from him!

67
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,154
He's Ace's friend, so I'm
not gonna let him get hurt!

68
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,658
Well, would you look at that.
It runs in the family.

69
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,294
You came here to rescue
your big brother?

70
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,628
[LUFFY]
That's right.

71
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,532
Do you have the slightest idea
who our forces are up against?

72
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,839
A squirt like you is gonna
get slaughtered real easy!

73
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,642
[LUFFY growls]

74
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,743
Shut up!

75
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,745
You don't know! You
don't even know me!

76
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,214
[LUFFY]
I know what you're up to!

77
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,718
Yeah. You wanna
be the King, huh?

78
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,754
First you gotta go through me!

79
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:29,890
Got it?

80
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,427
[WHITEBEARD]
Mm...

81
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,337
What a cheeky little punk!

82
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,172
Don't come crying to me for help

83
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,341
if you get a few boo
boos, spoiled brat!

84
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,241
Yeah right!

85
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,610
I'm not all old like you!

86
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,748
I'm gonna be the
one to rescue Ace!

87
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,395
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES murmur]

88
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,764
Hey, it's Luffy.

89
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,000
He's that famous rookie
with the straw hat.

90
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,635
Does he have a connection
to Whitebeard

91
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,603
that we don't know of?

92
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,170
Damn, he's stupid!

93
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,239
Who breaks out of the
world's greatest prison,

94
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,442
then goes straight to Navy HQ?

95
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:25,246
Jeez, if I were him, I'd be
hiding under my bed right now.

96
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,148
He's not stupid, he's Luffy.

97
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,148
Huh?!

98
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,284
This is the only way he knows.

99
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,456
Luffy.

100
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,124
Pops.

101
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,494
[WHITEBEARD] Straw Hat, eh?
He's just like his brother.

102
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,164
Old man.

103
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,499
[WHITEBEARD]
Hm?

104
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,836
I heard somethin' on that Navy
ship I think you should know.

105
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,271
Look at this bonehead!

106
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,172
Why doesn't Whitebeard
just kick his ass?

107
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,340
Get on with it!

108
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,476
[IVANKOV]
He is fearless, isn't he?

109
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,410
Truly his father's son!

110
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,979
They're throwin'
out the schedule

111
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,248
for an immediate execution.

112
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,450
Are you positive that's
what you heard them say?

113
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,186
Yeah, they said they
gotta get all set

114
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,453
for something first, though.

115
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,189
But I don't know what for,
'cause they were using codes.

116
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,191
[WHITEBEARD growls]

117
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,593
I think you wanna rescue
Ace as bad as me,

118
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,428
and that's why I'm tellin' you.

119
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,962
Well, all right.

120
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,368
I suppose it's lucky I ran
into you, then. Thanks, kiddo.

121
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:22,202
Sure thing. No big deal.

122
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,137
[ALL gasping]

123
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,738
Now he's talking like
they're equals?!

124
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,041
That boy has got
some serious balls!

125
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,409
Right!

126
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,011
Hang on, Ace, I'm on my way!

127
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,180
[yells]

128
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,182
[BUGGY]
And there he goes.

129
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:39,419
[LUFFY grunts, yells]

130
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,623
Gum-Gum Bazooka!

[MARINES yelp]

132
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,593
[LUFFY]
Get outta my way!

133
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,196
Well, he's Ace's
brother, all right.

134
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,364
Third division,
let's get moving!

135
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,967
Keep up with the boy and
try to follow his lead!

136
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,069
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yell]

137
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,736
Let's lend our support!

138
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,271
[BUGGY]
What?

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,576
[BUGGY]
C'mon! Really?

140
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,181
Fourteenth division,
let's clear a path!

141
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,116
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE B]
We're right behind you, boss!

142
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,417
[MARINES scream]

143
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,354
Luffy.

144
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,824
One rookie daredevil
suddenly takes the lead

145
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,360
and they're acting
like a whole new army.

146
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,629
Not that it matters,
our strategy is airtight.

147
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,300
Don't hesitate!
Follow my orders!

148
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,301
[WHITEBEARD chuckles]

149
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,302
So typical of Sengoku.

150
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,172
He probably doesn't think the
execution of a mere pirate

151
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,808
deserves the formality
of a schedule.

152
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,712
The big question is what're
they getting set up for, first?

153
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,683
Hey, Pops! Just in case
you haven't heard,

154
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:45,686
word on the street is they're
expediting Ace's execution.

155
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,021
Straw Hat told me.

156
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,123
How're Squard and the others?

157
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,324
They're tangled up pretty tight

158
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,327
with the vice admirals
at the head of the bay.

159
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,829
I was just about
to fly over there

160
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:55,963
and lend 'em a helping hand.

161
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,865
No, wait. Not yet.

162
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,501
Something in my gut tells
me Sengoku wanted us

163
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,936
to get that leaked info.

164
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,637
He wants us to advance.

165
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,938
Huh?

166
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,708
That old bastard's too clever
to let his strategy get out.

167
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,444
Not that easily, at least.

168
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,347
He's many things,
but not a fool.

169
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,315
Everybody, climb!

170
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,083
[gasps]

171
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,921
A light speed kick?

172
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,359
Did you think I was
gonna let you pass?

173
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:28,061
You fellas are awfully confident
for a bunch of nobodies.

174
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:28,829
[JILL grunts]

175
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:31,565
Damn! It's Admiral Kizaru!

176
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,233

355
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:42,522
Go home, Luffy!
I didn't ask for this!

356
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,192
[ACE]
I'm begging you.

357
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:49,863
Please, I can't let
you die here with me.

358
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,032
It's my fault.

359
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,501
It's all my fault.

360
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,937
Ace.

361
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,838
[ACE gasps]

362
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,473
You're my brother!

363
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,375
[MARINES gasp]

364
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,781
[ACE]
It's the truth!

365
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:12,886
All it takes to become brothers
is to share some sake!

366
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,623
From here on out, we're
honest to goodness brothers!

367
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,792
[LUFFY laughs]

368
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,068
Did I just hear them say
that they're brothers?

369
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,903
So then, he's also
Roger's son?

370
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,006
But both of Ace's parents
were dead when he was born.

371
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,708
That can't be possible, can it?

372
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:38,579
[LUFFY panting] I don't
give a damn what you want!

373
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,414
I'm here to save you!

374
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,848
You stubborn jackass!

375
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,184
[LUFFY grunts]

376
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,219
[yells]

377
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:49,222
Move out, zombie soldiers!
Attack and capture!

378
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,325
[gasps]

379
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:58,298
Seawater?

380
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:01,102
[JIMBEI grunts]

381
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:02,369
Jimbei!

382
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,705
They came from
Devil Fruit powers.

383
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:07,207
And thus, they are
weak to the sea.

384
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,375
[MORIA gasps]

385
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,245
Press on. These zombies
will prove no match for me!

386
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,079
'Kay, if you're sure.

387
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,747
"First Son of the Sea" Jimbei!

388
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,215
We've gotta fight a Warlord?

389
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,416
[SENGOKU]
Gather your wits!

390
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,452
You're making a
mockery of the Navy

391
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:21,021
by letting this rookie
take control of things!

392
00:20:21,055 --> 00:20:22,623
[GIANT MARINE A]
Lemme at 'em!

393
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,292
I'll crush this
squirt into paste!

394
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,028
[yells]

395
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,261
[LUFFY, JIMBEI grunt]

396
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,299
[SENGOKU]
Make no mistake.

397
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,234
He's a true threat
in the making.

398
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:38,338
He was raised alongside "Fire
Fist" Ace as his step-brother.

399
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,040
And if that's not bad enough,

400
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:44,111
he's the biological son of
the revolutionary, Dragon.

401
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:45,879
[MARINE FF] Did he just
say what I think he said?

402
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,248
[MARINE GG] He's the son of
the worst criminal in history!

403
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,851
Makes you think twice
about who you punch, huh?

404
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:53,086
Why didn't anyone tell
me that's his dad?!

405
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,889
Now they know!

406
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:55,956
Aw, man!

407
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:57,224
[MORIA whimpering]

408
00:20:58,158 --> 00:20:59,626
Luffy.

409
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,195
[HANCOCK] It wouldn't
bother me if your father

410
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:02,996
was the devil himself.

411
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,469
I had no idea!

412
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,037
Well, damn.

413
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:15,175
Okay. Gum Gum Pistol!

414
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,109
[LUFFY grunts]

415
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,844
[LUFFY screams]

416
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,788
I finally understand what
happened at Loguetown.

417
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,958
It only makes sense that
Dragon would save his own son.

418
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,360
Did you hear what he just said?

419
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,896
[MAN AA]
Does he mean the Dragon?

420
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:36,863
[JOURNALIST A]
Head Office!

421
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,998
Can you hear me?

422
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:40,834
I'm calling from Sabaody!
I've got huge news!

423
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:42,937
We're talkin' worldwide
headlines here!

424
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,938
[MARINE P growls]

425
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,039
I guess we'll just have
to kill him, too!

426
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,107
[MARINES yell]

427
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,709
[MARINE HH]
We can't let him survive!

428
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,445
Who cares?

429
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,847
There's no reason to
hide it any longer.

430
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,350
And it's not like it's gonna
make his life any worse,

431
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:59,186
since he's already
a notorious outlaw.

432
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,620
[sighs]

433
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,723
You two brothers are
both damn fools.

434
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,660
Third Gear!

435
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,365
[LUFFY yells]

436
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,466
[GIANT MARINE A yells]

437
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:21,741
Now, Gum-Gum Giant Rifle!

438
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:26,580
[LUFFY growls]

439
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,549
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES cheer]

440
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,552
[LUFFY]
Hey, Ace!

441
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,453
[ACE whimpering]

442
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:36,623
Say whatever mean
stuff you want!

443
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:39,793
I'm still gonna save you!

444
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,395
[ACE gasping]

445
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,729
Oh, hell yeah.

446
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:45,099
Your brother speaks for
every one of us, Ace!

447
00:22:45,132 --> 00:22:47,301
Yeah, we're all a part
of your family, too!

448
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,769
And nothin's gonna stop us!

449
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,672
Hey, Marco.

450
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:54,341
Don't let that kid die,
no matter what.

451
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,309
Heh. You got it.

452
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:04,451
Luffy.

453
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,528
[NARRATOR] As Ace watches
watches helplessly

454
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,330
while the battle
unfolds before him,

455
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,332
he comes to an
important decision,

456
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,201
though he's unable to act.

457
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:25,106
Meanwhile a flurry of friends,
foes, and fantastic powers

458
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:27,440
explodes on the battlefield.

459
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,142
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

460
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,378
"Hard Battles,
One After Another!

461
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,147
Devil Fruit Eaters vs.
Devil Fruit Eaters!"

462
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,484
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
