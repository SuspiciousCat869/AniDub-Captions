00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,741
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,510
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,812
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,814
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:47,784
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,453
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,288
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:55,225
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,161
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles

46
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:59,529
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,231
of the World Government,

48
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:05,134
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,737
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,140
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,444
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:16,312
the crew will
cut a path across

53
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:19,649
the Grand Line
to the New World!

54
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:26,256
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

55
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,192
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother Ace.

56
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:33,229
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison Impel Down.

57
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,899
[NARRATOR] While Buggy and
Mr. 3 escaped from Level 4,

58
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:38,434
Luffy, who had been poisoned
by Warden Magellan,

59
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,803
was whisked off to a mysterious
haven for prisoners

60
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,538
known as New Kama Land.

61
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:46,309
There, he received treatment
from its leader, Ivankovs.

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,179
I know what's going on
in the world right now.

63
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:53,249
There's been a shift in the tide
and big changes are coming.

64
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:56,819
The Navy and the Whitebeard
Pirates are taking center stage.

65
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:59,923
Even so, the "big man's"
still waiting things out.

66
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,525
I'm of course referring
to my comrade,

67
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,461
the leader of all
revolutionaries in the world.

68
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,865
You may know him as Dragon!

69
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:10,833
Oh, you're talkin'
about my dad.

70
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,169
[IVANKOV]
What?

71
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,204
[IVANKOV groaning]

72
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:17,707
Your dear papa.

73
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,710
And I never knew! Goodness!

74
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,747
[NARRATOR] After hearing
that Luffy is Dragon's son,

75
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:28,685
Ivankov decided to join him
in his efforts to rescue Ace.

76
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,787
[IVANKOV] The Vivre Card was
pointing down, which means

77
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,790
he's still here and still
alive, thank goodness.

78
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,728
[MAGELLAN]
This is it, Portgas D. Ace.

79
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,830
You're going to be
transferred to Marineford.

80
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,732
Upon your arrival there,

81
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:46,402
you will be taken to
the execution grounds.

[LUFFY grunting]

95
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:36,686
[IVANKOV] What a bothersome
little trap. Ha! Death. Wink!

[GUARD A] W-Who are you
people? How did you--

103
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,003
Hello, there.

104
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:56,572
I'm going to need to
borrow you for a moment.

just hope we're not too late.

where only the most legendary

It's your brother!

Can you hear me?! Ace!

Ah!

Whoa! He turned into a girl!

[IVANKOV] It's the you, you were
always afraid to be. Look.

I'm... beautiful.

143

[IVANKOV] You've been
reborn, my dear.

144

You're no longer a jailer.
You're a New Kama now!

Oh! Thank you!

What have I been doing all
of these years? My gosh.

I don't know how I can
ever repay you, Iva!

148
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,052
[IVANKOV] Oh, it's nothing.
Don't mention it.

149
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,620
Ah, there is one thing--

150
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,721
Where is Ace?!

151
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,056
Down that way!

[LUFFY panting]
This one?! Ace?!

155
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:04,518
[panting] He's gone!

156
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:07,521
Are you absolutely certain
that this is the right cell?

157
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:11,993
Yes, I promise you!
He-He was just here, I swear!

Then it's him. It must be.

[ACE gasps]

162
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:34,849
She said that my
brother is here.

163
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,350
[JIMBEI]
She was telling the truth!

164
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:39,320
I never thought anyone could
penetrate this fortress,

165
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:42,256
let alone make it all
the way to Level 6!

[LUFFY]
Yeah.

[JIMBEI] You're a moment
late! He was here!

170
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:50,831
They took him to the elevator
for the prison transfer!

171
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,167
Go! There's still a chance
you can catch them!

172
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,269
Thanks, but who are you?

173

00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,596
All right. Let's move. Thanks
for the help, whoever you are.

[JIMBEI]
Who is this boy?

177
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,510
To brave the impossible, to
accomplish the inconceivable,

178
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:39,246
and to charge into yet another
struggle more hopeless

179
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,183
than the last? And Ace knew.

180
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:44,518
[ACE] My brother really
would break into here!

181
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:47,054
He does stupid things without
thinking all the time!

182
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:49,590
Since we were kids,
he's always been reckless

183
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:52,960
and made me worry
about him! That idiot!

184
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:54,829

Mm...

[LUFFY, IVANKOV panting]

186
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,383
[INAZUMA] They took that
elevator to the upper floors.

187
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,617
Let's go!

188
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:20,554
[INAZUMA] Thankfully,
they've left the gate open.

189
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:21,722
[LUFFY]
Nice!

190
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,591
[IVANKOV groaning] It seems
like the operation system

191
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,926
is locked up! It won't budge!

192
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,162
[LUFFY]
Uhh. Well, that sucks.

193
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:30,664
All right.

194
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,900
We'll just have to climb up.
There's no other way!

They can't let things be
convenient for us, now can they?

We'll just have to find
ourselves another way.

Hey! Those jerks
blocked the staircase!

209

They're trying to trap us.

210
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:19,613
We'll just have to break
through then, won't we?

211
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,449

Sounds good!

get yourselves killed,
don't take us with you!

it a second thought!

How cowardly.

is now blocked off completely.

231
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,291
The sleeping gas
is highly effective,

232
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,259
and there's nowhere to run.

Just in case,
keep the guards on standby.

to Warden Magellan?

to keep my job!

It's only a matter of time
before they catch Straw Hat.

00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:20,234
Apparently, the Freezing Hell
wasn't punishment enough

253
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,470
for him. Since the cell you
were in now has a vacancy,

254
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:26,073
Straw Hat will have
a taste of the torment

he shouldn't have recovered

from my poison, and so quickly!

How did you survive?

it up like a ribbon!

with the problem, I suppose.

Inazuma ate the Snip-Snip Fruit,

308

so now he's a scissor-man.

[IVANKOV] He can manipulate
whatever he cuts

310

[LUFFY] We gotta keep
going up, crab guy!

Thanks for blocking out the gas,

319

but now I can't go up
the stairs to get to Ace!

320

This is the only way to
prevent the sleeping gas

from filing up the room.

00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:16,178
If you're unconscious,
you can't save anybody, can you?

323
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,413
I'll save him whether
I'm unconscious or not!

324
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,582
I'm not gonna let him die,
you understand?

[INAZUMA]
Don't be ridiculous.

326
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,287
It was a simple plan,
but it defeated us nonetheless.

327
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,257
As much as I hate to admit it,
we're trapped here on Level 6,

328
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,058
at least for the time being.

329
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:34,062
Sorry, buddy. Well,
this is all I can do.

At least the jerks
can't watch us now.

Well, we gave it a good shot.
But no time for regrets.

332
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,675
I'm sure that by now, they've
made their way to the top floor

333
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,644
to hand off Ace
for the transfer.

334
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,745
Even if we could get out,

335
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:54,349
we'd have quite the mélange
of obstacles in our way.

00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,120

You're right on time. Very good.

343
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,220
Impel Down hereby transfers
custody of the criminal,

344
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:08,624
Portgas D. Ace, to the
Navy forces present today.

345
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,165
[GUARD I sighs]

346
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,244
--[ACE] Here.
--[LUFFY] Huh?

347
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,812
But it's just a scrap of paper.

348
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,248
[ACE] Do yourself a favor
and always hang on to that.

349
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,451
That scrap of paper
will reunite us one day.

350
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,352
[LUFFY]
Yeah?

351
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,187
[ACE]
You don't want it?

352
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:41,223
No, I'll keep it.

353
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,893
Luffy. [grunts]

354
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,773
C'mon! It's time to start
thinking of ourselves.

355
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:00,442
The first step is
your escape. I promise.

356
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:03,712
I will do my very best to break
you out of this prison safely.

357
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:05,547
As far as Ace Boy
and the Navy goes,

358
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,383
that ship has already
sailed, literally.

359
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,385
Give up on him, 'kay?

360
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,387
Or rather, put your
faith in Whitebeard.

361
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:14,523
There's no way he'd give
up on one of his own!

362
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,325
He'll come up with something.

363
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,898
--I'm leaving.
--Huh?

364
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:26,868
I'm going to Marineford.

365
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:30,305
[IVANKOV groans]
Don't be stupid!

366
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,307
A massive battle is
about to take place

367
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:35,844
between two of the most powerful
forces in the entire world!

368
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,680
Do you have any idea
how strong Whitebeard is?

369
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,781
What about all the admirals,

370
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,584
vice-admirals, and the
Warlords on the Navy's side?

371
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:43,952
Remember them?

372
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,654
[IVANKOV] And are you
also forgetting that how

373
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,889
close to death you were after
the fight with Magellan?

374
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:51,259
Do you have that
many lives to spare?!

375
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,229
[IVANKOV]
What is it?!

376
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:59,334
Look. If I give up now,
I'll regret it.

377
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,870
[IVANKOV gasps]

378
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,741
[IVANKOV] I know that face.
I've seen it many times before!

379
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:10,379
It's the face of his father.
Staring at me, unflinching.

380
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,481
[INAZUMA] You can do as
you like, but first of all,

381
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,516
how do you propose we
get off of this floor?

382
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,751
[PRISONER chuckles]

383
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,353
[IVANKOV, INAZUMA, LUFFY]
Huh?!

384
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:24,393
If you want out that
bad, then set me free.

385
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,929
I'll make a hole in the ceiling
and you'll be free to go.

386
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,965
--Sound good?
--[chains rattle]

387
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:33,568
[PRISONER chuckles]

388
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,544
[LUFFY gasps]

389
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:58,360
[LUFFY] No way!
They've got him down here, too?

390
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,328
--Crocodile.
--[CROCODILE chuckles]

391
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:06,001
Just like old times, huh?

392
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,870
Did ya miss me?

393
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,078
[NARRATOR] Luffy and his
friends recruit Crocodile

394
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,713
and Jimbei, forming a
plan to catch up to Ace,

395
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,382
and escape from Impel Down.

396
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,751
Meanwhile, Hannyabal
hatches a plan of his own,

397
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:25,787
with the intent of
intercepting them on Level 4.

398
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,957
With nowhere left to run,
a full scale battle breaks out

399
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,659
inside the walls of the prison.

400
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,427
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

401
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:35,797
"The Ultimate Team is Formed
Shaking Impel Down!"

402
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,533
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
