Okay.

At daybreak, the pirates

But the only way that they'll
be able to get to the village

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,516
is to go up this slope.

50
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,018
The rest of the shoreline
is sheer cliffs,

51
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,395
so they have to
come through here.

won't mean anything

Because that would be like
sliding into a meat grinder.

can best me with a sling shot,

of fighting dirty!

treasure ships to me

00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,467
[USOPP]
No.

175
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,218
They're gonna show up all right.

176
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,636
And lots of them.

177
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,059
Wait a minute.

178
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:53,518
Maybe I'm hearing things,

179
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:57,481
but it sounds like battle
cries from somewhere.

180
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:01,068
[PIRATES yelling]

181
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:05,364
Yeah, I definitely hear them.

182
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:07,157
No, it can't be.

183
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:08,658
What can't be?

184
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,204
There's a shore just
like this to the north!

185
00:11:12,245 --> 00:11:14,081
They went...

186
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,500
We're at the wrong
shore?! That's not good!

187
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,210
[USOPP] Well, this is where
they had their secret meeting

188
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,670
so I just assumed okay?!

189
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,005
[groans]

190
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,257
We need to hurry!

191
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:27,094
Before they make it to
the village! Where is it?!

192
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,678
You have to head
directly north from here.

193
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,889
If you run you, could
make it in three minutes.

194
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,682
The terrain there is
almost exactly the same,

195
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:35,185
so all we need to do
is stop them at the slope.

196
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,104
Don't you worry,
we're gonna stop 'em.

197
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,063
[NAMI gasps]

198
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,190
Oh no!

199
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,275
If those filthy pirates
are at the north shore,

200
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,111
then they've already
seen our boats!

201
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,570
They'll take our treasure!

202
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,531
I'll be there in 20 seconds!

203
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:48,573
Aw, man!

204
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,284
My brilliant oil strategy
was all for nothing!

205
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,954
My precious treasure...

206
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:54,913
[ZORO]
Hey!

207
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,540
What're you doing?
Let's get outta here.

208
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:57,457
[NAMI]
Yeah.

209
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,043
[NAMI screaming]

210
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,211
[ZORO yelps]

211
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,921
Help! I'm gonna fall!

212
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,298
Let go, you moron!

213
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,259
Sorry!

214
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,552
Hello.

215
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,303
See ya there!

216
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:14,641
[yelping]

217
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:18,103
Sorry, but you understand,
the treasure's in danger.

218
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,647
That oil won't be a
problem for you, right?!

219
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,566
That girl's gonna pay!

220
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,453
I swear on my life, they'll
never set foot in my village!

221
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,413
That Luffy sure is
a good runner.

222
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:38,623
He's so far ahead, I can't
even see him anymore.

223
00:12:38,665 --> 00:12:41,126
[LUFFY] Run straight north!
Run straight north!

224
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:44,129
Run straight north!
Run straight north!

225
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:45,630
Those mongrels
are in big trouble

226
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,674
if they so much as
look at my treasure!

227
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:52,762
[PIRATES yelling]

228
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:58,518
It's an ambush!
Somebody's up there!

229
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,105
We meet again.

230
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,328
[USOPP] I am the legendary
Captain Usopp!

231
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,663
I've been waiting for you!

232
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:26,046
All my men and I are ready
to fight to the death!

233
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,007
Turn back now if you
value your lives!

234
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,555
[USOPP] I wasn't supposed
to be the first one here.

235
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,643
He was running way ahead of me.
I can't handle these guys alone.

236
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,664
[ZORO]
Crap!

237
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:03,291
How am I supposed
to get past this stuff?!

238
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,798
[LUFFY] The village...
That can't be right.

239
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,092
He said run north and I ran
in a cold‐ish direction

240
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,094
so I should be at the shore.

241
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,187
It's you. I remember.

242
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:27,107
You're one of the troublesome
brats who overheard our plan.

243
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:28,358
What do you think you're doing?

244
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:29,818
I'm warning you!

245
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,820
Leave here while you still can!

246
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,489
If you don't,
my 100 million crewmen

247
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,908
will massacre all of you!

248
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:39,953
100 million?

249
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:43,415
Are we really supposed
to believe that?

250
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:46,376
No way! 100 million! Incredible!

251
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,295
[PIRATE I]
Captain! He's obviously lying!

252
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,213
[PIRATE J] Then it's time
to call his bluff.

253
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,965
[USOPP]
They saw through it!

254
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:55,135
[PIRATE K] That guy seriously
thought he could fool us.

255
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,305
What's that?! You've been
lying to us this whole time?!

256
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:00,056
[PIRATE L] Captain Jango,
take a look at this.

257
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,266
Oh no, is it bad?

258
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:02,309
[PIRATE L]
No, sir! It's good!

259
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,476
We searched those other ships

260
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,395
and found a huge
load of treasure!

261
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,646
It's hard to say how much,

262
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,773
but I bet it's around
five million berries!

263
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,483
What?

264
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:11,610
[gasps]

265
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,987
Five million berries?

266
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,449
How in the world did those guys
get ahold of so much treasure?

267
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,494
[USOPP]
I see you found my loot!

268
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:22,662
Well, you can have it!

269
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:25,165
[PIRATE K] You're just gonna
let us take your treasure?

270
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,125
[USOPP]
That's right!

271
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,336
Just turn around and
forget all about this place

272
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,004
and the treasure is yours!

273
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:34,132
I didn't think people that
stupid actually existed.

274
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:37,594
At this point, he's just
embarrassing himself.

275
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,347
Okay, do you know
what a pirate is?

276
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,598
We're going to
take this treasure

277
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,309
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

278
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,144
And there is no way
we're turning back

279
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:49,189
until we get what we came for.

280
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,650
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

281
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,361
[JANGO]
All righ, then.

282
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,323
On the count of "one, two,
Jango," you'll let us by.

283
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:01,201
[gasps] It's that strange
weapon from before.

284
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,495
[JANGO]
One, two!

285
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:04,704
Jan‐‐!

286
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,499
Don't you ever try to give
my‐hard earned treasure away!

287
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,837
My head!

288
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,839
‐‐Hey! Who is this crazy girl?!
‐‐Captain!

289
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,633
This isn't the time to be
hypnotizing yourself,

290
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,469
we got a mission to
carry out, remember?!

291
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,470
[NAMI]
That treasure boat is mine

292
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,681
and I'm not gonna let
you have a single berry.

293
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,808
Do ya hear me? In fact
you better clear out,

294
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,810
'cause I'm coming down
there to get it back!

295
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:27,852
That really hurts!

296
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,479
[NAMI] Who said you could
give them my treasure?!

297
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,730
You got what you deserve!

298
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,232
[USOPP]
I didn't give them the treasure,

299
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,526
I just said I would
give it to them!

300
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:35,652
That's the same thing!

301
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,071
And I just saved your life.

302
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,323
I guess I forgot to
mention it to ya earlier,

303
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,492
don't ever watch
his ring routine.

304
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:45,412
That weirdo's a hypnotist.

305
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:47,080
Hypnotist?

306
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,373
So, where's Luffy?

307
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:51,209
He's a fast runner, I thought
he'd be here way ahead of you.

308
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,711
I don't know. He either got lost

309
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,213
or he chickened out
at the last minute.

310
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,590
[sighss] The only thing that
could keep him from a fight

311
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:59,384
is getting lost.

312
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,094
Right when we need him, too.

313
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,679
[USOPP] I'll go ahead
and take command here.

314
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,764
I think it's about time
you go 'n kick their butts!

315
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,766
[NAMI] What?! Me?!
What about you?!

316
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,686
I can't take on a boatload
of vicious pirates by myself!

317
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,187
That's just suicide!

318
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:12,856
What? Like I'm gonna
do any fighting?

319
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:16,609
Beneath this calm exterior lies
the abject terror of a coward.

320
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,361
Oh, so you think you're scared?!

321
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,281
Well, I'm so scared I am
literally about to cry!

322
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,450
[USOPP] Please! Your eyes
are completely dry!

323
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,617
You'll have to do
better than that.

324
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:25,785
Liars can smell their own.

325
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,537
[NAMI]
That's just your upper lip!

326
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,538
[USOPP]
I got beat up by...

327
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,875
[JANGO] We don't have
time for this nonsense.

328
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,543
All right, men,
let's get to work!

329
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,462
Crush them and
move to the village!

330
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,255
‐‐[PIRATES yelling]
‐‐[BOTH gasp]

331
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:40,759
Here they come.

332
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,636
Wait! I know!
I have some caltrops!

333
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,764
Those are just what
the doctor ordered!

334
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,265
Lemme have some!

335
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:51,644
Your gonna love this!

336
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:52,771
Caltrop!

337
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,773
[BOTH]
Hell!

338
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,111
[ZORO yells]

339
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:05,325
Nami...

340
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,160
...if your still alive
when I get outta here,

341
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,787
I'm gonna kill you!

342
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,666
[growling]

343
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,296
[ZORO]
Take that, oil!

344
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:19,839
[ZORO yelling]

345
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:24,302
[ZORO panting]

346
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:28,431
Now... how do I get to
the north shore from here?

347
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,309
Run straight north!
Run straight north!

348
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,520
Run straight nor‐‐!

349
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,360
But which way is north?

[PIRATES yelling]

351
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,782
Yes! We got 'em!

352
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,826
Check it out! Here comes...

353

...the Lead Star!

Bastard!

355
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:56,626
Way to go! You're quite
the warrior after all.

356
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,795
Looks like you got this handled
so I'll just take a break.

357
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,505
But you haven't
done anything yet!

[NAMI yelps]

359
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,882
Uh, what is it?

360
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,385
There are caltrops behind us.

361
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,720
Idiot! You dropped those
things behind us, too?!

362

[PIRATE M yelling]

363
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:11,391
Get outta the way!

00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,401
Ha. Don't tell me
you really thought

365
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,027
you were going to
stop us down there.

Let go of me, you jackass!
You want some more?!

I will never...

374
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:49,345
...let you step foot

Today will be like every other
day in that sleepy little town,

379
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,858
'cause you and your cronies
will never set foot in it!

[JANGO] We've wasted enough
time playing pirates!

388

Quit bothering with them
and move to the village!

389
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,761
Or have you forgotten that this
is Captain Kuro's operation?

390
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:32,430
And he doesn't look favorably
on his well laid plans

391
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:34,307
being ruined by idiots!

392
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,600
He'll kill us all!

393
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,477
You understand that,
you cretins?!

394
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:38,144
He's right!

395
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,979
Yeah! Let's get to the village!

Don't go any further.

398
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,989
I said stop!

another step.

Please, don't kill them.

403
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,757
Just leave this village alone.
They're good people.

404
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:11,469
They don't deserve this.
I love this place.

Please!

[PIRATE G]
What is this, Captain Jango?

407
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,657
[PIRATE M] Nobody told us
that killers like those

408
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,367
were gonna be here!

409
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,952
It's about time.

410
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,125
Is that the best those
pirates can dish out?

411
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,545
Yeah, I was hopin'
for a challenge.

412
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:46,212
And you!

00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:47,213
After leaving me down there,

you're lucky I'm not
kickin' your butt too!

Ussop, you big bonehead!

416
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:53,803
You never told me which
direction was north!

417
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,473
Who are these guys?

418
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,150
[KURO]
They're late.

419
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,695
I don't appreciate
tardiness. Not one bit.

420
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,864
They know full well
what happens to those

421
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,867
who are foolish enough
to upset my plans.

422
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,543
[KURO] Do they think they
can take their sweet time?

423
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,378
Well, if they have
forgotten the consequences

424
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,423
of disappointing me...

425
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:32,425
I'll kill them all.

426
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,906
It looks like the butler
from Kaya's mansion.

427

But it's so early
in the morning.
