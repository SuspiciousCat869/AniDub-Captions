00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,097
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,007
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:32,726
[NAMI]
It can't be.

25
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:37,897
[ENERU]
It's not that people fear God.

26
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:41,067
Rather it is God
who is fear itself.

27
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:42,569
Zoro!

28
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,904
[ENERU]
Thirty million volt Hino!

29
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,493
That drum.

30
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,374
[ENERU]
So why get back up?

31
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,418
[WYPER]
For my ancestors.

32
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:08,428
I... I've always wanted to
go to endless vearth.

33
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:11,765
Can I come with you?

34
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,768
[LUFFY] Hey! Zoro!
What's wrong with you?

35
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:18,438
Wyper, no!

36
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,690
[ROBIN]
Skypiea will be destroyed.

37
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,650
It will be cast down
to the surface.

38
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,486
Our village too?

39
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,030
Everything.

40
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:29,324
Behold the Ark Maxim!

41
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,493
[ENERU laughs]

42
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:32,869
[AISA]
I know where they are.

43
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:35,455
There are only two voices
left on this island.

44
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:38,833
It has to be Nami and Eneru.

45
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,378
I need you to take me
to them right now.

46
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:49,427
[LUFFY] "They Finally Clash!
Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!"

47
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:55,934
[horn blaring]

48
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:02,190
[CONIS]
There it is, Angel Island!

49
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,362
Everyone, heso!

50
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:10,532
The arch criminals Pagaya
and his daughter Conis,

51
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,908
along with their accomplice,

52
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:15,412
the former God Gan Fall,
are still on the loose!

53
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,539
Please be on your guard!

54
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,666
[MCKINLEY]
If anyone sees these fugitives,

55
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:23,628
please alert me,
McKinley, immediately!

56
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,673
Again, report any
news directly to me!

57
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:30,552
In the name of the great God
Eneru, we of the White Berets,

58
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:34,347
will defend the security of
Skypiea with our very lives!

59
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,640
[WHITE BERETS]
Heso!

60
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:39,144
Ah, it's good to know
we can count on them.

61
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,812
But I'm still scared!

62
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:43,314
Those horrible criminals
could be hiding out nearby

63
00:04:43,398 --> 00:04:44,941
or even among us!

64
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,735
If they're struck down
by God's judgment,

65
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:48,361
we might be too!

66
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,989
[WHITE BERET D]
Captain! I have a report!

67
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,032
[MCKINLEY]
Hm?

68
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,491
What's the matter now?

69
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,618
[inaudible]

70
00:04:55,702 --> 00:04:57,912
What? You say that
Pagaya's daughter

71
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:59,831
has just been seen
in the harbor?

72
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:18,016
[WHITE BERET E] The heretic has
entered through gate number one!

73
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,434
[MCKINLEY]
I don't get it.

74
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:22,312
Why'd she come back when
she knows she'll be caught?

75
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,396
[MCKINLEY]
Don't let her get away!

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,482
Capture her at all costs!

77
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,652
Ha! Come on, criminal.

78
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,158
Please make way!

79
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:40,246
[WHITE BERETS shouting]

80
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,792
[MCKINLEY]
Move it! Outta my way!

81
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,381
Wha--

82
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:53,176
[WHITE BERETS]
Captain!

83
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:01,976
[WHITE BERETS]
Captain!

84
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,199
[BOTH gasp]

85
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,450
Oh no.

86
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,160
[CROWD shouting]

87
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,453
[MALE A]
Captain Mckinley!

88
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,538
[MALE B]
It's the criminal!

89
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,664
[MALE C]
Stay away!

90
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:25,417
[MALE D]
Judgment will fall on her!

91
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,505
[ENERU laughs]

92
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:38,888
[NAMI]
Look at all that gold!

93
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:42,308
[ENERU] Remember your girl
friend from Angel Island?

94
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:44,602
I've been listening and it
sounds like she's causing

95
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,312
an uproar among
the citizens.

96
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,064
Conis? No way!

97
00:06:48,148 --> 00:06:50,817
She should be waiting on
the Going Merry right now!

98
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,987
[ENERU] There's a great deal of
noise outside at the moment.

99
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,115
But no matter. It's hardly
worth mentioning.

100
00:06:57,198 --> 00:07:00,201
[ENERU laughs]

101
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,828
[gasps]

102
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,998
[NAMI] Uh, about this Mantra
ability that all of you

103
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,542
seem to possess.

104
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,128
Can you use it to locate
a specific individual?

105
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:13,882
Not usually. Most of
us lack that ability.

106
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:18,386
However, I can. I am unique.

107
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,597
In addition to my
Mantra abilities,

108
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,850
my lightning powers allow me
to pick up electrical vibrations

109
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,186
and overhear conversations.

110
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,105
When I hear someone
say something, shall we say,

111
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,984
"out of line," I cast
my Judgment on them.

112
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:36,237
The range of my hearing extends
over this entire land.

113
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,697
[NAMI]
So that's it.

114
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:40,742
[ENERU] It's a suitable talent
for a god, isn't it?

115
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:45,205
[ENERU laughs]
Run as fast as you can,

116
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:49,000
people of the sky!
This is Skypiea's last dance!

117
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:53,338
A party of angels
dancing in the sky! Haha!

118
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,424
You! Have you ever seen the
look on a mortal's face

119
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:58,468
when he suddenly
loses his footing?

120
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,762
[ENERU laughs]

121
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,806

He's out of his mind.

He's crazy, he's crazy,
he's crazy!

124
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,439
What should I do? I have to
get away from here, or else.

125
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:14,984
No. Even if I get away,
he'll destroy the sky island.

126
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:18,321
There's got to be something
I can do, but what?

127
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:24,411
[gasps] I... I-Is there
something wrong?

128
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:29,833
[ENERU]
Who is that?

129
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,460
[ENERU]
No, it's nothing.

130
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,800
[CONIS]
Please! You must listen to me!

131
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:41,386
No! Get back, stay away!

132
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,432
Everyone. You have to listen
to me! Please calm down!

You must hear what
I have to say!

Get away from us, criminal!

136
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,772
Leave this island,
you pestilence!

137
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:55,316
Yes! You must leave now
or we'll all be destroyed

138
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,776

strikes you down!

Don't come any closer!

This is a Burn Bazooka.
I'll use it.

at the edge of the clouds
right away before it's too late!

We have to escape

Use every ship you can find and
leave Angel Island at once!

What kind of lunacy is this?

153
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,741
Eneru's planning to destroy
this land and everyone on it!

If we don't evacuate now,
we're going to die!

What kinda trick is this?

157
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,999
Is this revenge?

Hey, what's going on?

178
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,286
[CONIS] It's because
there's no longer any point

179
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,038
in taking one life alone.

180
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:58,166
"Skypiea is doomed." It's true.

181
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,835
A member of the Divine Squad
escaped from Upper Yard.

182
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,755
He risked his life to
deliver that message.

183

He died.

184
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:08,968
He died with my father when
Eneru cast judgment on them.

just up and go like that!

Eneru is! Has he ever
shown mercy? Compassion?

He's always had the power
to bring us to despair,

can to save ourselves!

That's right.

Eneru destroyed his own
homeland, and then came here.

Birka was home to many
strong warriors,

but we White Berets were
once in the Divine Squad,

pledged to the service
of Lord Gan Fall.

273
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,909
We thought that if we pretended
to betray the Divine Squad

274
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,952
and swore our allegiance
to Lord Eneru,

275
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:04,162
we could stay on the island

276
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,873
and find some way to
protect the citizens.

277
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:11,711
But, now it's all too clear
that plan was a failure.

278
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:15,256
We tried to keep anyone from
provoking Eneru's anger.

279
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,385
We hoped that if no one
disobeyed him, they'd be safe.

00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,813
[ENERU]
Ah, I see.

347
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:03,485
You are no ordinary human, but
you're a mere Paramecia type.

348
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:06,404
You can't beat me.

349
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,992
[ENERU] Nothing that lives
can stand against me!

350
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:14,245
That's why... I am God!

351
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,748
[yells]

352
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,792
[ENERU] El...

353
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,753
...Thor!

354
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:23,171
No!

355
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:26,007
[AISA screams]

356
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:33,932
[NAMI]
Luffy... No.

357
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:36,059
[NAMI shouts]

358
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,614
[BOTH gasp]

359
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,285
I'm impressed that you
managed to dodge it.

360
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,579
Sixty Million Volts!

361
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,498
[NAMI]
He dodged it?

362
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:00,375
[ENERU]
Julungul!

363
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:03,962
[yells]

364
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:06,006
[BOTH gasp]

365
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,307
One hundred million volt.

366
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,184
Vari!

367
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:22,397
[NAMI]
Of course!

368
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,191
If I'd thought about it,
I would've realized it sooner!

369
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:29,029
Lightning can't hurt Luffy,
he's made of rubber!

370
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:33,658
I've had enough of you! Get off!

371
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,163
[gasps]

372
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:40,165
[BOTH gasp]

373
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,090
[yells]

374
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,467
[ENERU]
Stay calm!

375
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,053
Physical attacks still
can't affect my body!

376
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,972
He's just a helpless monkey
from the Blue Sea World.

377
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:57,640
[yelling continues]

378
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,517
[groans]

379
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:04,356
[NAMI] His electrical powers
are completely useless!

380
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:07,442
Eneru must never have imagined
there was someone in the world

381
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:12,572
who was immune to lightning!
It's incredible, but it's true.

382
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:17,660
[ENERU grunts, groans]

383
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,247
[NAMI] Luffy may be the
only person in the world

384
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:25,752
who can battle Eneru.
They're natural enemies!

385
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

386
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

387
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

388
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

389
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

390
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

391
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

392
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

393
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

394
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

395
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

396
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

397
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

398
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:45,582
[ENERU] Behold! This is a
ship suitable for God!

399
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:48,043
I'll destroy Skypiea
and everyone on it,

400
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,920
and depart for the Endless
Vearth as I was destined to do!

401
00:23:51,004 --> 00:23:53,089
[LUFFY] Not if I have
anything to say about it!

402
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:57,594
[ENERU] Now, activate the
circuit of despair! Deathpiea!

403
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,471
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

404
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:02,891
"Maxim Surfaces!
Deathpiea Is Activated!"

405
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,643
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
