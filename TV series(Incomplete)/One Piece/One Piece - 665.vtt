WEBVTT

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:32.051
[TEACH cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.455
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:36.292
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.429
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:42.772
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.055
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:46.299
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.436
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.077
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.353
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.824
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:03.366
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.839
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit, sets sail

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:09.045
into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:12.985
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.528
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:20.701
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.206
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.779
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:28.082
Luffy had intended to win
a tournament that promised

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.889
the Flame-Flame fruit to the
champion, but abandoned that

00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:33.426
plan when Law was
captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.832
Now, he rushes to the
palace to save him.

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:38.638
I never thought he
might still be alive!

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.873
[ZORO]
Why have I never heard of 'im?

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.442
Who is this guy?

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:43.947
[LUFFY]
He’s... my brother.

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.987
[laughs] It’s just like
Ace said back then.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.590
We all went our separate ways,

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:50.828
but we never stopped
being brothers!

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:58.309
[LUFFY] "“A Burning Passion!
Rebecca vs. Suleiman!"”

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:03.821
[CROWD cheering]

00:04:03.855 --> 00:04:09.632
[panting]

00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:20.353
[SULEIMAN grunts]

00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:24.261
[GYATS] Suleiman renews his
savage assault on Rebecca!

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:26.567
He’s fended off her
Back-to-the-Water Dance!

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.405
He may very well be
our champion today!

00:04:29.438 --> 00:04:30.908
Put her in her place, Suleiman!

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.979
[WOMAN B]
Drown, already! Go to hell!

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.783
Off with her head!

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:36.853
You got this, buddy!

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:42.297
Suleiman was once a war hero,
but despite his accolades

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:46.439
in the Dias Naval Battle,
he was exiled as a war criminal

00:04:46.472 --> 00:04:49.244
and now walks on the dark side!

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:59.132
[GYATS] He stalks the
battlefield like a ghost.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:02.405
No! Like a grim reaper!

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:04.441
Everything that I did...

00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:06.947
It was all for the
sake of my country.

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.017
A land that I once loved.

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:13.292
[SULEIMAN]
Can you say the same?

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:15.732
[MAN F]
Get out of Dressrosa!

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:18.135
[MAN G]
Down with the Riku bloodline!

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.443
The people truly
seem to despise you.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:22.813
It must be suffocating,

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:25.450
living under the weight
of their contempt.

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:29.458
I don’t care how hard it is.

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.930
I don’t care how
much they hate me.

00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:33.232
All I want...

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:38.844
All I want is to live together
with Soldier in peace!

00:05:41.482 --> 00:05:43.252
[AGILIA grunts]

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:45.057
[AGILIA]
Rebecca.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.894
She refuses to submit!

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.362
Such a beautiful--

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:52.003
Ah--such a <i>detestable</i> display!

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:54.876
Anyway, let’s hear it for
the final 30 competitors

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:56.379
here in Block D!

00:05:56.412 --> 00:06:00.521
[CROWD cheers]

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:03.594

00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:12.210
[AGYO groans]

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:15.718
[ORLUMBUS grunting]

00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:18.489

[CROWD cheers]

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.810
Another man is down!
Or rather an animal!

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:31.984
The lion Agyo is truly
the king of the beasts,

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.754
making the coliseum run red

00:06:33.787 --> 00:06:35.992
with the blood of his
countless victims!

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.762
And yet, even a king must kneel

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:40.400
before the might
of Orlumbus’ whip!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.540
[yells]

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.817
He’s strong!

00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:50.721
Yeah, you got this!

00:06:50.754 --> 00:06:52.358
[GYATS]
Our strongest competitors

00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:53.927
are still in the game.

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:57.267
But we may see an upset
from an unknown fighter!

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.575
At any rate, only
one can advance!

00:07:00.608 --> 00:07:03.112
They’ve all got their
sights on Rebecca!

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.183
[CROWD clammors]

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.822
[GYATS]
Who’s gonna take her head?

00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.030
[REBECCA]
Soldier.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.368
I don’t know where
you are right now.

00:07:14.402 --> 00:07:17.808
But please, don’t die!
That’s all I ask!

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.754
[MAN H]
What’s taking so long?

00:07:23.787 --> 00:07:25.257
[MAN I]
Chop her up already!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.260
[MAN J]
Die, Rebecca!

00:07:27.293 --> 00:07:28.563
[SULEIMAN]
I derive some pleasure,

00:07:28.597 --> 00:07:30.901
hearing all that
hatred raining down.

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:32.438
You know why?

00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:34.475
Because when I defeat
you in a moment,

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.948
it shall surely become applause.

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:40.219
[REBECCA]
He’s fast and lethal.

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:42.124
I can’t treat him
like the others.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.261
[SULEIMAN] I shall give
the audience a gift.

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:46.600
One last look at
your pretty face

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.171
after I slice it off your skull!

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:53.113
It looks like Suleiman
is out for blood.

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:55.985
He wants Rebecca dead
as much as we do!

00:07:56.018 --> 00:07:56.854
[SULEIMAN grunts]

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:57.888

[AGILIA groans]

00:08:28.984 --> 00:08:31.556
Huh? What a twist!

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.563
Agilia just took
a blow for Rebecca!

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:35.664
Agilia!

00:08:35.697 --> 00:08:36.533
[AGILIA grunts]

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:39.338
You had better get
out of my way!

00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:40.775
Did she save her,

00:08:40.808 --> 00:08:43.613
or is she merely
delaying the inevitable?

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:48.890
[GYATS] At any rate, now the
crowd hates Agilia, too!

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:56.338

[REBECCA]
Please, hang in there!

00:09:12.371 --> 00:09:14.742
Listen to me, Rebecca.

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:18.550
No matter what, you...

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:20.052
...you must...

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:22.725
...win this.

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:27.033
Promise me.

00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:51.983
This fight isn’t over
till I take your head.

00:09:58.029 --> 00:09:59.866
[GYATS]
Suleiman the Beheader continues

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:02.337
his assault on Rebecca!

That looked bad.

Hm? What’s up?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.365
[KIN’EMON]
Sir Zoro is missing.

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:18.537
He was with us
only a moment ago.

00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:20.808
We ran in a straight line.

00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:23.312
How do you mess up that bad?

00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:25.183
[KIN’EMON] Should we turn
around and search for him?

00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:27.054
We don’t have time for that!

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:28.657
Traffy needs our help!

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.293
Let’s just go!

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.497
He always finds us
sooner or later.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:34.067
[KIN’EMON]
Is that so?

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:42.852
[ZORO]
Wha...?

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:44.723
Oh...

00:10:44.756 --> 00:10:47.026
Where did everybody go?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.903
Why’d you turn when nobody
else did, you dummy?

00:10:51.936 --> 00:10:53.305
[ZORO groans]

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:54.709
[BOY A]
Look at that big toy!

00:10:54.743 --> 00:10:57.247
[WICKA gasps]
Someone’s coming!

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:02.759
It’s a samurai cat!
And he’s fluffy, too!

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.496
Check out his haircut!

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:07.735
[ALL]
He’s so cool!

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:09.839
[ZORO grunts] The last
thing I need right now

00:11:09.872 --> 00:11:12.177
is a bunch of brats
crawling all over me!

Just try to be nice!

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:15.417
Everyone here thinks
you’re a toy!

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.153
If you go around town
starting trouble,

00:11:17.187 --> 00:11:18.958
your cover will be blown!

00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:20.561
I know that!

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:45.844
[sobs] This cat toy is bad!
I hit my head!

00:11:45.877 --> 00:11:47.214
It hit a child!

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:51.155
Toys aren’t supposed to do that!
The thing must be broken!

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:55.263

Call the police, hurry!

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:56.265

[POLICE B]
Don’t make me shoot you!

00:12:04.247 --> 00:12:05.751
[ZORO]
I barely touched his head!

00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.955
It’s not my fault the
kid is such a wuss!

00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:09.826
[WICKA] I warned you,
but you wouldn’t listen!

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.434
What the heck is your problem?
You really are a blockhead, huh?

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:16.038
[ZORO]
Very helpful. Thank you.

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:17.942

Oh, hey, there you are!

00:12:32.838 --> 00:12:36.813
[KIN’EMON] I’m pleased to
see you unharmed, Sir Zoro.

00:12:36.847 --> 00:12:41.054
Ha, ha! It’s a little person!

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.694
Follow my directions, and
I’ll get you to the palace.

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:45.864
Where did you find her?

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:48.068
[KIN’EMON] Is she a friend
of yours, Sir Zoro?

00:12:48.102 --> 00:12:51.308
[ZORO] Eh, I don’t know
if that’s the word I’d use.

00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:54.281
I’m a member of the King
Riku Army’s Scouting Unit.

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:56.185
The name’s Wicka.

00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.422
Anyway, we need to step on it!

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:02.497
[WICKA] The operation is
already starting without us!

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:20.266
What?!

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.576
What do you mean "the
Soldier went on ahead"?

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:25.978
He’s the leader!

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:27.881
While we’re down here,
he’ll be busy

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:30.621
preparing for the next
leg of the operation.

00:13:30.654 --> 00:13:31.857
Once we take out Sugar,

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.396
Doflamingo will be vulnerable
to a surprise attack.

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:36.733
So he’s headed to the palace

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:39.371
with a team of Tontatta
to assassinate him!

00:13:39.404 --> 00:13:41.141
[DWARF A]
Good luck, commander!

00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:43.914
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:44.983
But we’ll be fine,

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:47.521
because we have a
legendary hero like you!

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:51.462
Please take command of Operation
SOP and do battle with Sugar!

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:53.466
Only you can lead us to victory!

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.838
What?!

00:13:55.871 --> 00:14:00.881
[DWARVES cheer]

00:14:00.914 --> 00:14:03.419
[USOPP] Don’t give me
the most important job!

00:14:03.452 --> 00:14:05.356
Are you nuts?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.772
This is where we are right now.

00:14:29.805 --> 00:14:34.181
All the bridges
in this area move.

00:14:34.214 --> 00:14:37.220
Now take a look at that
building in the distance.

00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:42.765
[LEO] The one that looks
like a sea anemone.

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.671
That’s the executive tower
where our target, Sugar,

00:14:45.704 --> 00:14:47.273
will be waiting.

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:51.048
[USOPP]
Can we even get there?

00:14:51.082 --> 00:14:53.820
I doubt they’ll
let us just waltz in.

00:14:56.859 --> 00:15:00.166
[USOPP yelps]
Uh-oh!

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.302
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Stop screwing around

00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.470
and get back to work!

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:03.540
Y’think I don’t see you?

00:15:03.574 --> 00:15:06.078
[screams]

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.750
They’ve found us!
We’re done for!

00:15:08.783 --> 00:15:10.086
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Wait a minute!

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.556
What ship do you work on?

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:13.661
I’m just an innocent
passerby, sir!

00:15:13.694 --> 00:15:15.330
Feel free to ignore me!

00:15:15.363 --> 00:15:16.633
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
We don’t allow anyone

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.402
to get off the ship
except the brokers.

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:20.140
Everyone knows that!

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:21.275
Now, Inhel!

00:15:21.308 --> 00:15:22.443
Right!

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:24.682
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Huh?

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:26.051
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A gasps]

00:15:26.085 --> 00:15:27.220
Huh?

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:31.863
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES whimpering]

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:34.033
The fairies are here!

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:36.071
[BOTH]
They took all our stuff!

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:38.209
Tontatta... Combat!

00:15:38.242 --> 00:15:40.480
[LEO, INHEL]
Tail Hammer!

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:41.983
[BOTH yelp]

00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:43.720
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:46.158 --> 00:15:48.061
[USOPP]
Naked and buried, huh?

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:50.066
[COTTON]
Here, Usoland. Robiland.

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:51.335
Your disguises.

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:54.942
Nice one! Wow!
You really think fast!

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.948
Pretending you were scared gave
us the perfect chance to attack!

00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.921
A brilliant strategy
from our hero!

00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:02.725
We can’t just force our way in,

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:04.962
and getting a disguise
is nice and sneaky!

00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:09.371
Uh-- Yeah, of course! [laughs]

00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:11.342
Hey, are all of you
guys that strong?

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.813
That attack really
packed a punch! Yeesh!

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.750
[LEO]
That’s pretty average for us.

00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:18.422
Of course, that’s nothing
compared to your power!

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:21.963
People from Noland’s bloodline
can take down Sea Kings!

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:31.014
[USOPP]
Great. They really think

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:34.321
I’m some kind of superpowered
monster, don’t they?

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:37.861
Y’know what? Fine!
I think I have plan!

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:41.603
Maybe I can pull this
off without fighting!

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:43.272
[USOPP]
All right, listen to Usoland!

00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:45.611
I am taking command
of this operation!

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:47.848
Our target is
a little girl, right?

00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.586
So we’re not gonna fight her.

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:52.190
We’re gonna scare
her out of her wits!

00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.894
[DWARVES]
Yes, sir!

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:56.866
Uh... Actually, uh...

00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:58.970
Lead the way, my brave friends!

00:16:59.003 --> 00:17:01.843
[DWARVES yell]

00:17:01.876 --> 00:17:04.715
To the tower! Straight ahead!

00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:07.286
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:13.199
[PIRATE A]
Everyone, get in the lift!

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.503
There’s an intruder
at the Toy House!

00:17:19.912 --> 00:17:21.516
It’s one of the
Straw Hat Pirates.

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:23.753
Franky. The report says

00:17:23.787 --> 00:17:26.491
he’s at the east entrance,
fighting with Señor Pink.

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:29.598
He’s aiming for the
factory on this floor!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.368
Good luck out there.

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:32.370
If we take him out,

00:17:32.403 --> 00:17:34.340
we should get a nice bonus!

00:17:34.374 --> 00:17:36.512
Holy crap! Like how much?

00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:39.117
Well, his bounty is pretty high!

00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:40.219
I’ll be rich!

00:17:40.252 --> 00:17:41.689
You gotta share!

00:17:41.722 --> 00:17:43.426
[PIRATES laughing, chattering]

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:45.095
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Yeah, we’ll see!

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.879
At this rate, we’ll be stuck

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:13.019
going up and down
in here forever.

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:15.524
Let’s take over the lift.

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:17.026
Wait here for now.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.435
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Huh?

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:24.676
I’m seizing this
lift! Don’t move.

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:25.911
I know you!

00:18:25.944 --> 00:18:29.117
The soldier from the coliseum!
How’d you get in here?

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:29.985
Where’d he go?

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.454
Over here!

00:18:33.325 --> 00:18:35.897
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
Little punk!

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.634
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H groans]

00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:39.839
You’re too slow!

[REBECCA whimpers]

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.780
[TOY SOLDIER]
Too slow!

00:18:43.813 --> 00:18:47.353
[REBECCA] That’s domestic
violence! It’s child abuse!

00:18:47.386 --> 00:18:48.856
[TOY SOLDIER]
You were supposed to dodge!

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.863
If it was up to me,
I wouldn’t hit you at all!

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:54.201
Then don’t follow through
with your swing!

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:57.407
You need a sense of danger
to improve yourself!

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.678
Now focus! Once again!

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:05.690
[TOY SOLDIER]
Human instinct is powerful!

00:19:05.723 --> 00:19:09.230
You’re much stronger than this!
Look within yourself!

00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:11.803
Show me the
strength of humanity!

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:13.071
[REBECCA]
What would you know about that?

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:15.544
You’re a toy!

00:19:15.577 --> 00:19:17.681
And you’re still too slow!

00:19:17.714 --> 00:19:19.685
[REBECCA groans]

00:19:19.719 --> 00:19:22.958
[TOY SOLDIER]
That’s it, Rebecca. Focus.

00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:27.433
[TOY SOLDIER]
Bring out your human instincts!

I don’t want to
practice anymore!

[REBECCA] Why can’t you
keep protecting me?

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.949
[REBECCA]
You promised, didn’t you?

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.156
[REBECCA] That you’d stay
by my side till the end,

00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:57.260
no matter what!

00:19:57.294 --> 00:19:59.197
Remember, how you
said that happiness

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.234
would return to me someday?

00:20:01.268 --> 00:20:04.508
Until then, you’re
s’posed to stay with me!

I'’m nothing but a toy,
beaten by the wind and rain.

[TOY SOLDIER]
This body is not meant to fight.

Perhaps toys only exist
to be broken, from the start.

00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:42.952
Before the children who play
with them become adults.

failed you as a father.

Yeah, no joke!

I musta blinked and missed it!

So it seems the rumors are true.

I’m speechless, folks!

[NARRATOR] What happened
in the battle for Block D?

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:18.696
And what are the
Slicing Winds of Rommel

00:23:18.729 --> 00:23:21.769
that instantly knocked every

When the shocking truth is
revealed, it sends tremors
