1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,781
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,950
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,384
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,389
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,521
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:59,442
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,486
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:07,242
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:21,798
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:26,177
[SAILOR SS]
The commodore seems sad lately.

25
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,555
[DOCTOR]
Yeah. It's unfortunate.

26
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,890
He thought he made such
a good friend out here.

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,813
None of this makes any sense.

28
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,857
It looks like we're gonna
set sail first thing

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,316
tomorrow morning.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,361
The villagers are so upset
that we can't go near them.

31
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:46,531
Plus, I don't remember ever
hearing the bell ring today.

32
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,076
[NOLA hisses]

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,871
[KALGARA] How dare you
show your face here!

34
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:55,874
Do you want your wife to
live her life as a widow?

35
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:12,057
[LUFFY]
"Eternal Friends!

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,603
The Vowed Bell Echoes
Across the Mighty Seas!"

37
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:24,861
I gotta say, this is
definitely a tough way to leave.

38
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:27,280
Doctor?

39
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:28,907
[DOCTOR yelps]

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,912
[MOUSSE]
Good evening.

41
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:35,413
[DOCTOR]
Mousse?

42
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,457
Sorry. May I speak with you?

43
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,421
Idiot!

44
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:45,632
Why did I believe
he was a botanist?

45
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,680
[KALGARA growls]

46
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,682
Damn you, Noland!

47
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:59,062
If these are the unfortunate
victims of your advancement,

48
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,314
then we never should
have accepted you

49
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:03,400
or trusted you the way we did.

50
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,030
[DOCTOR]
Kindred Trees?

51
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,782
[MOUSSE]
Yes.

52
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:13,410
We've been told that
the spirits of our ancestors

53
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:15,662
who died on this island
are guided back

54
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:19,124
by the sound of a bell so
that they may rest inside them.

55
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,043
Since the age of Shandora,
every one of our ancestors

56
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,713
who lived on the island
watches over us.

57
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:28,717
They watch over us from
those sacred, white trees.

58
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,885
That is why the Kindred
Wood is so important

59
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,470
to us Shandorians.

60
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,727
That is why we've protected
them as we've protected

61
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,312
our own lives.

62
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:45,108
It's more than just a forest;
it's our history.

63
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:49,070
Can you see now why
we hold these trees sacred?

64
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,239
[DOCTOR] And we just
chopped them all down.

65
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:55,118
The warriors felt
so betrayed and angry

66
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,662
they grabbed their weapons
in search of revenge.

67
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,289
[WARRIOR A] We must
drive them off this island!

68
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,874
[WARRIORS]
Yeah! All right!

69
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,879
[MOUSSE] But because you had
already saved so many

70
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:08,214
lives here,
they couldn't just...

71
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:11,551
[DOCTOR]
I understand.

72
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:16,514
They were so grateful
that they couldn't act on it.

73
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,226
But Doctor, even if it
was just for tree research.

74
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,395
Even if you didn't know.

75
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,231
The villager's anger
won't go away.

76
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:28,151
So before you go,
I thought I'd ask.

77
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,239
I have to know the reason why.

78
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,788
[NOLAND] So their ancestors'
spirits are in those trees?

79
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:41,456
I can't believe I didn't know.

80
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,959
And now we've done something
terrible that we can't reverse.

81
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:47,629
They have every right
to be as angry as they are.

82
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,798
[DOCTOR] But Commodore.
We had no choice--

83
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,050
[NOLAND]
There are no excuses!

84
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,802
I was too wrapped up
in my own interests

85
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,179
to even consider theirs.

86
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,515
[growls]

87
00:05:58,598 --> 00:06:00,892
[NOLAND] I was told that
besides proclaiming

88
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,769
the city's existence,

89
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:06,356
the bell also served as
a guide for their ancestors

90
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,233
to return to the island.

91
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,653
And we just cut them down!

92
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,489
We do not deserve
their forgiveness.

93
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,199
Commodore, wait.

94
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,329
[NOLAND]
Listen up, everyone!

95
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,789
[SAILORS]
Huh?!

96
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,583
You want us to leave
the treasure behind?!

97
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,212
[SHANDORAN A] I just found out
Noland and his men are getting

98
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:30,797
ready to leave.

99
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,595
[MOUSSE panting]

100
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:48,023
[KALGARA] Mousse.
Where have you been?

101
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,528
[MOUSSE]
What if...

102
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:01,703
What if you knew a single
tree was tainted by poison?

103
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,955
Poison that would
contaminate the forest,

104
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,582
spreading from tree to tree.

105
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:09,085
From tree to people,
and kill the island.

106
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,005
What if you knew
about it beforehand?

107
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,214
[WARRIOR B]
What are you talking about?

108
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:14,841
[WARRIOR C2]
Please tell us what you mean.

109
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,468
If we had a choice.

110
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,180
[MOUSSE] What would we
do with that one tree?

111
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:21,973
[crying]

112
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,558
What would we do?

113
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,896
Father, listen.

114
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,356
You have to stop them.

115
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,482
You fool.

116
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,067
Don't you understand
what they've done?

117
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,570
We can't leave things this way!
We'll regret it forever!

118
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,531
You've finally made
such a dear friend.

119
00:07:38,615 --> 00:07:40,867
And we owe them so much!

120
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,745
Father, we can't leave
them hurting like this!

121
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,747
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,374
[MOUSSE cries]

123
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,002
There is no excuse,
but on the commodore's behalf,

124
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:52,712
I must say this:

125
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:54,964
Those woods were already
dead before we arrived

126
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,841
on this island.

127
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,302
The worst thing about
Tree Fever is that it also

128
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,845
infects plant life.

129
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:03,556
Commodore Noland understood
this, and that was his reason

130
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,892
for doing what he did.

131
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,894
This is also why
he pleaded with you

132
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:09,854
without regard for his own life.

133
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:15,026
From people to forest
and forest to people,

134
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,237
several small islands
have been destroyed

135
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,324
in exactly the same way.
Killed by fever.

136
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:22,909
[MOUSSE gasps]

137
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,412
[DOCTOR] But there's
nothing to worry about.

138
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,747
Yesterday, we finished
inspecting the rest

139
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,374
of the forest.

140
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm sorry we cut down
your forest without knowing.

141
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,921
And I feel worse that we
never explained why we did it.

142
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,633
It's probably unforgivable
even with an explanation.

143
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:43,513
But a botanist would never harm
a forest without good reason.

144
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,724
Trust me, the commodore
doesn't have anything

145
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,183
against gods or spirits.

146
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,102
[MOUSSE crying]

147
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,939
[DOCTOR] It's just that he
always has to make a choice.

148
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,692
And he always knows
what is most important.

149
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,820
So...

150
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,281
That means that they did all of
that to try to help our people?

I'm sorry, Noland!

Please don't leave yet!

Does everyone have everything?

156
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,508
Not everything.

You wuss, hah!

158
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,430
[NOLAND] All right,
everyone, to your positions.

159
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:26,848
It's time to set sail!

Yeah!

00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,485
[KALGARA] I can't believe
I made such a mistake!

The bell.

00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,213
Why would it be ringing now?

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,367
Is that you, Kalgara?

176
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,925
[KALGARA]
Come back!

177
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,014
[KALGARA]
Noland!

178
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:53,143
Come back, please, Noland!
You've got to!

179
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:58,231
I'll ring the bell so you
can find your way back to us!

180
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:00,900
I don't want you to
lose sight of this island!

181
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,486
Because... one day...

182
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,948
I want you to return,
my dear friend.

183
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,742
Noland!

184
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:10,618
Please come back!

185
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:18,501
[NOLAND crying]

186
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,799
[KALGARA] I know we'll meet
again someday, Noland.

187
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,718
Have a safe voyage.

188
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,016
[NOLAND]
So... I can come back again?

189
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,482
Of course I will.
I'll come back.

190
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,200
Someday, Kalgara!

191
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,535
I know we'll meet again!

192
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:55,580
[bell rings]

193
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:14,349
[NARRATOR] There once was
a man named Montblanc Noland.

194
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:18,019
He was from a kingdom
in the Northern seas.

195
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,313
Noland, or
"Noland the Explorer,"

196
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:24,651
always told stories about
his incredible adventures.

197
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,861
They were so incredible
that the villagers

198
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,155
could never tell if
they were true or not.

199
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,119
One day, Noland returned
from a long journey

200
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,704
to report to the king.

201
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:39,791
[NOLAND] It stands proud
and beautiful in ruin!

202
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:42,460
The city is named Shandora!

203
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,629
But they call it
"The City of Gold,"

204
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,673
which describes it perfectly.

205
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:48,341
[KING, COUNSELOR laugh]

206
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,220
[KING] Marie Jois has finally
granted us permission

207
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,431
to enter the Grand Line.

208
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:57,600
So I would like to send
you on another mission.

209
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,561
It would be my pleasure.

210
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,730
[KING] There will be
a slight change, however.

211
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,441
This time, my soldiers
and I will accompany you.

212
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,360
Is that understood?

213
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:08,445
Yes.

214
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,116
[SETO]
Kalgara!

215
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,284
[KALGARA]
Seto.

216
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,618
[SETO] You're off
to ring the bell, right?

217
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:16,703
I'll help you.

218
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,789
[NOLA hisses]

219
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:22,292
[SETO chuckles]
It's good to see you too, Nola!

220
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,127
You sure have made yourself
at home in these ruins,

221
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,253
haven't you?

222
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,342
Hey, when do you think Noland
and the rest of his crew

223
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,634
are coming back?

224
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,136
[KALGARA chuckles]

225
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:35,638
That's all you ever ask
about when we come here.

226
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,433
It's not exactly easy
for him to return.

227
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,728
He was born all the way
in the far northern seas.

228
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,772
He also has a family back home.

229
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,815
But... he promised.

230
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,027
As long as we keep ringing
this bell the way we have been,

231
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,446
he'll show up again someday.

232
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,948
[SOUTHBIRD calls]

233
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,245
[KALGARA]
What's happened to the sky?

234
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,497
Come on, Seto!

235
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,332
We have to protect the village!

236
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:29,067
[NOLAND]
Why?

237
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,696
Why does the island
suddenly end here?

238
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,031
[NOLAND grunts]

239
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:38,243
Damn you, Noland!

240
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,704
I cannot believe I ever
trusted you. You liar!

241
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:44,332
Where is the city of gold you
promised I would find here?

242
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,960
[NOLAND]
Where did the village go?

243
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,754
What happened to the island?

244
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:54,759
Kalgara, if you're alive,
please ring the golden bell!

245
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,470
Answer me, fire of Shandora!

246
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:04,894
[CITIZEN A] Noland's public
execution is about to start!

247
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,564
Hey! It's this way, guys!

248
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,733
[NOLAND]
It's true.

249
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:13,945
I saw a giant city of gold on
the Grand Line island of Jaya.

250
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,283
The City of Gold
does exist, I assure you.

251
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:20,660
[JUDGE] Let us hear
from one of your crew.

252
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,954
Is this man telling the truth?

253
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,751
He's not. It's an absolute lie.

254
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,002
No! Please.

255
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:30,920
You can't trust
anything that man says!

256
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,255
He's a liar!

257
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,923
[GIRL CITIZEN A]
Were all his stories fake?

258
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:35,258
Hey, that's not fair!

259
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,052
He's been lying to the
whole kingdom and acting

260
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,261
like a hero!

261
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,013
Wait, hold on!
Where'd you get that witness?

262
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,723
He's not even part of our crew!

263
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:44,392
Did you happen to see
Kalgara and the others?

264
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,394
[SAILOR EE]
Commodore! What happened?

265
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:48,646
Seize all of them!

266
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,482
[SAILORS gasp]

267
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:51,900
[SAILOR EE]
Damn it!

268
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,818
Leave my men alone.

269
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,322
[JUDGE clears throat]

270
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,616
For his heinous lies,
Montblanc Noland

271
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,494
is hereby sentenced
to death by beheading!

272

00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:13,797

00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,469
[CITIZENS]
Liar! Liar!

Liar! Liar!

[chanting continues]

279
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:12,814
Look at that!
A giant island of Vearth!

280
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,190
[GOD]
Can you hear that?

281
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:17,318
The singing voice of
this beautiful Vearth.

282
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:21,281
It is truly the
birth of holy land.

283
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:24,075
This is definitely
where I must live.

284
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,663
[KALGARA]
What's going on here?

285
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,249
What happened?

286
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,792
Why can't I breathe?

287
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,878
[WARRIOR B]
Is everybody all right?

288
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,004
[WARRIOR F]
Pull yourselves together!

Get up!

[WARRIOR H]
Kalgara!

292
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,722
I hereby claim
this Vearth as mine!

293
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,515
You will call me God!

294
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,352
[KALGARA]
You are not God!

295
00:17:51,227 --> 00:17:53,188
Shandorians, we fight!

00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,439
[WARRIORS yell]

297
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:56,441
We cannot let
them take our land!

[WARRIORS yelling]

299
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,196
[KALGARA]
We made a promise, Noland.

300
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,907
We promised we would
meet again someday.

301
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:08,370
[NOLAND]
Kalgara... where are you?

302
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,040
[KALGARA] When you finally
return, what will you think

303
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,750
when you see we're gone?

304
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,588
Hold on a little longer!

305
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,799
I'll let you know
that we're still here!

306
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,302
[NOLAND]
Are you alive?

307
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,971
[KALGARA]
I have so much to tell you!

308
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:29,683
[NOLAND]
Kalgara!

309
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,851
I have to know
if you're all right!

310
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,941
[KALGARA] Let's meet again
on the same land one day!

311
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:42,028
Noland!

312
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:45,031
Light the fire of Shandora!

313
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:47,033
[CHIEFTAIN]
And the great Warrior Kalgara

314
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,618
continued to shout.

315
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:51,204
Just once would've been enough.

316
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:54,249
But he believed that
the Fire of Shandora

317
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:58,044
would echo and tell
the world that we are here.

318
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:00,547
But the bell never rang once.

319
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,009
And then, everything was
explained to our villagers.

320
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:09,097
Sailors from the Blue Sea
told us that Noland,

321
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,474
to whom we owe so much,

322
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:15,770
had such pride for our city
that he refused to deny

323
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,734
Shandora's existence
and died known as a liar.

324
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,321
But it was too late.

325
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:28,199
The great warrior
Kalgara had died honorably

326
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,076
in battle here in the sky.

327
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,080
He was never able
to convey his message.

328
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:38,793
And that was the Great
Warrior's biggest regret.

329
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,088
[WYPER] Do you think we'd
still be able to reach him?

330
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,965
If we rang the bell now,

331
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,092
do you think we'd be able
to still reach Noland?

332
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,385
Tell me the truth!

333
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,806
That's a good question.

334
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,434
Well, we are close to Heaven.

335
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,063
[AISA]
Wyper! Come on!

336
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,939
We'll die if we don't leave now!

337
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:04,736
Please, Wyper!

338
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:06,279
[WYPER]
Eneru!

339
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:09,657
What gives you the right to
take away everything we know?

340
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:14,120
[ENERU laughing]

341
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:17,582
This is the sky!
It is God's domain!

342
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,501
Everything is an eyesore!

343
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:24,047
The people, the trees, the land!
Return to where you belong!

344
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,217
Let everything rain
into the Blue Sea!

345
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:32,847
Get to the boats!

346
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,934
Angel Island won't
last much longer!

347
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:38,603
Sir, what do we do with the
people who've been injured?

348
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,855
Hurry! We'll treat them
once they're in the boats.

349
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:47,529
[CROWD yelling]

350
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:49,197
[MCKINLEY] What would've
happened if that girl had

351
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,116
approached me any later?

352
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,742
I hope she's all right.

353
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:06,131
[ROBIN]
He's far above now.

354
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,216
It's only a matter
of time until his ship

355
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,802
reaches the top of the vine.

356
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:11,928
[GAN FALL]
I don't get it.

357
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,930
What is it that Eneru
wants up there?

358
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,433
[ROBIN] I believe he's trying
to get to the golden bell.

359
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,559
[GAN FALL]
A bell?

360
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:21,896
[ENERU laughing]

361
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,483
The little angels will
scurry like the ants they are!

362
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,740
Return to where
you belong, Skypiea!

363
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,200
[CROWD screaming]

364
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:35,910
[SKY PERSON A]
What is that?

365
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,705
[SKY PERSON B]
A hole in the White White Sea?

366
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,959
[ENERU] I have no need for
God's Shrine anymore, either!

367
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,211
[laughing]

368
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:50,633
The city of Shandora
is useless to me as well!

369
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:04,606
There is only one thing
in this land that I want.

370
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,901
The gold belfry!

371
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:12,781
Suddenly I hear two voices.

372
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,866
[NAMI]
How can he run so fast?

373
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,327
[LUFFY]
Hang in there, Nami.

374
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,329
I'll take care
of this I promise!

375
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,749
Eneru! I'll never let you
have the golden bell!

376
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

377
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

378
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

379
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

380
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

381
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

382
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

383
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

384
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

385
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

386
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

387
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

388
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

389
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,956
[ENERU] It's finally time for
that eyesore of an island

390
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,416
to disappear!

391
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,626
[NAMI] Look there!
The clouds are changing shape!

392
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,504
[LUFFY] I not gonna let
you have your way, Eneru!

393
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:54,090
[ENERU]
There's no stopping this Raigo!

394
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:56,134
[NAMI]
We have to escape! Hurry!

395
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,927
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

396
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:59,846
"Angel Island Obliterated!

397
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,265
The Horror of
the Raigo's Advent!"

398
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,893
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
