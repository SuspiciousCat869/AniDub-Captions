00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.404
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.440
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.210
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.445
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.747
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.848
You can have it!

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.684
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.953
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.921
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:26.126
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.992
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.928
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:47.200
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.302
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.670
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.972
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.807
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.243
this has proven to be
the end of the road,

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.946
a graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.584
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.219
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.889
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:14.093
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.898
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.668
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.738
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:28.074
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:32.946
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.814
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.050
get pulled into the conflict.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:42.322
This fight's startin' to
get super exciting now, huh?

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.257
I'd say a 50,000 man brawl

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.493
is the perfect time to
take them for a test drive.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:48.494
Test drive?

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.697
Did you say "them"? Them who?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.266
The Sunny just got
two brand-new weapons.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.502
Big ones! Do you
guys wanna see 'em?

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:59.138
[BOTH]
Yeah! Of course we do!

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.040
Three-Sword Style...

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:11.884
[ZORO]
...Black Rope Tatsumaki!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:15.989
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE EE]
This is sick!

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.724
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE FF]
It's a sword hurricane!

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:19.659
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE GG]
Run, you're gonna get cut!

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:23.129
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE HH] How long
is this thing gonna last?!

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.098
Until you get to Hell.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:28.134
What the--? He's gone! Huh?

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.970
[SANJI]
Ha, ha! Sky Walk!

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.207
Awesome! Sanji can
walk on air now!

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.044
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:42.048
Poele a Frire-Spectre!

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.916
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.487
[HORDY growls]

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.893
You can send a 100,000,
or 10,000,000 guys after us.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:57.297
But every single one of them
is going down, you hear me?!

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:02.201
[LUFFY] "Unveiled! The Secret
Weapons of the Sunny!"

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:09.442

Ha! [growls

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.785
[LUFFY]
Hah!

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:48.948
Heh.

[SANJI growls]

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:55.388
Don't think you can
show me up, Moss Head!

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.056
Yeah? Try to stop me!

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.961
[screaming]

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.430
This is not a competition.

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.672
Ah!

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.408
Just ignore them.
They act like this every time.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:16.409
[JIMBEI sighs]

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.010
Man. I was really hoping
they'd have grown out

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.980
of this stupid
macho act by now.

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:24.417
As long as everyone's
fired up, it's all good!

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.352
Time to take
them out for a spin.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.020
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about!

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.056
Wait, you mean the new weapons?

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.792
You know I do! Follow me!

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:34.293
[CHOPPER]
I'm so excited!

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.496
Hey! Wait up!

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.732
[PAPPAGU] Hang on! Don't
leave me out here by myself!

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.267
[BOTH panting]

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.069
You're crowding me!

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.071
Ah! Then go away!

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:49.208
You've done enough damage--
it's time to die!

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:50.977

Shut up!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H groans]

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:01.554
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H groans]
They're way too strong.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.755
Huh...?

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.090
[gasps]

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.627
What did you say to me?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.895
Huh?

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:12.732
[groans]

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.934
The humans are
"too strong" for you?

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.602
[whimpering]

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.805
You call yourself a Fishman?

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H]
Captain...! [groans]

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.410
I'm sorry, sir! Please!

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.079
What kind of soldier
whimpers and cries?

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:30.049
What kind of fishman
is afraid of humans?

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.951
Get out of my sight!

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:32.985

[HORDY]
Tch.

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:47.433
Didn't I tell all of you
to kill Shirahoshi already?

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.468
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES growling]

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.671

awesome! Nice digs!

[USOPP grunts, gasps]

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.484
Something looks different.

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.385
What did you do, exactly?

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:08.855
[FRANKY]
Heh.

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.023
[NAMI] There wasn't a
Five or Six before!

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:13.960
She's right! And it looks
like Zero's gone now!

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:14.994
[USOPP grunts]

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:18.064
I remodeled!
After some serious renovation,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.466
I was able to turn
Zero into Five and Six.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.834
[BOTH gasp]

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.369
Compartment Four
used to be empty,

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:26.005
but it holds one of
the new weapons now.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.475
And the other one is
tucked away in number Five.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.943
That's enough talking!

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.979
I wanna see the new weapons now!

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:35.515

Keep your pants on, bro.

[PAPPAGU grunts]

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.217
[FRANKY] Though you
might need a fresh pair

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:40.887
after you lay your
eyes on these!

Yo-ho-ho-ho!

Actually, I have a better idea!

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.707
How about instead,
we leave the world's

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.744
most lovely mermaid
princess alone, huh?

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:06.245

Why'd it get dark?

[PAPPAGU]
Is that good or bad?

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:52.478
It's way too cramped
for us all to be in here!

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:53.946
Then why don't you get out?

00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:56.048
You're not even interested
in the weapons anyway!

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.317
Because if I go outside,
I'm gonna have to fight!

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.352
I don't wanna be
stuck out there, either!

this up a little, please?

Heh, heh!

You can't rush greatness, kid.

[screaming continues]

00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:50.042
Kraken! Knock it off!

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:52.177
You stupid octopus!

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.780
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.281
[chuckles]

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:59.084
Crush 'em! All right!

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:02.888
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE Z groans]
Captain... Help me...!

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.123
[LUFFY]
Go that way, buddy!

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.591
[SURUME roars]

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.727
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE AA]
Damn it! What's going on?!

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.730
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE AB] It's
doing everything Straw Hat says!

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.665
But why?!

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:17.869
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.304
Listen up, Surume!

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:22.474
I want you to stay here
and protect Weepyhoshi.

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.076
[SURUME grunts]

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.377
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.383
[CHOPPER giggles]

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.618
[BROOK]
Yo-ho!

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:35.153
[FRANKY chuckles]

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:37.356
I can't believe you managed
to ingratiate yourself

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.692
to the Kraken. It seems
no matter where you go,

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:43.328
you always befriend the
highest caliber allies.

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.596
Think so?

00:22:44.629 --> 00:22:45.697
Um...

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.900
Thank you very much for lending
us your power, Surume!

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.902
[SURUME chukles]

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:52.571
[gasping]

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:57.075
[HORDY growls]

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:59.878
[LUFFY] There's still
a lot of these guys left.

00:22:59.911 --> 00:23:04.616
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:07.552
[LUFFY]
All right! Bring it on!

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:15.961
[NARRATOR] Franky's weapons
find a surprising foe

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:18.764
in Hordy's tiniest
follower, Daruma.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.166
Setting a trap for
the rampaging Straw Hats,

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:24.369
the New Fishman Pirates take
command of the battlefield.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:27.005
However, Chopper and Franky's
mechanical masterpiece

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.975
both have new transformations
in store that can only be

00:23:30.008 --> 00:23:31.877
described as "super."

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.478
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:36.715
"Iron Pirate!
Here Comes General Franky!"

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.984
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
