Ahh!

176
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,389
[LUFFY]
Hm?

177
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,391
Surely you know that plotting
an attack on this island

178
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,559
would mean certain death!

179
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,561
My army of 80 million super‐mean

180
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,098
pirate soldiers would
squash you like bugs!

181
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,901
Awesome!

182
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,735
[NAMI sighs]

183
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,372
[NAMI]
You expect us to believe that?

184
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,541
Ah! She knows!

185
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,076
Yep! Well, now I know.

186
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,311
How could I have
been so dumb?!

187
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,913
I practically told
her I was lying!

188
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,980
I am such an idiot!

189
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,115
So stupid!

190
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,550
[NAMI]
Uhh...

191
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,386
What?! He was lying?!

192
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,588
[USOPP]
Curse you, you crafty tactician!

193
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,623
80 million may have
been an exaggeration,

194
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,326
but I have a great many
men under my control!

195
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,732
[KIDS whimper]

196
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,502
My guess is three.

197
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,105
[KIDS screaming]
She does know!

198
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,308
[screaming continues]

199
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,079
Hey! Where're you
guys going? Come back!

200
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,615
[NAMI] A pirate using
a slingshot, huh?

201
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,617
Well, now I've seen it all.

202
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:51,457
[laughing] That's pretty cool!

203
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,126
Shut your mouth or
I'll shut it for you!

204
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:57,129
I'm a proud man and
I won't stand for it!

205
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,464
This is your
last warning,

206
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,300
or you'll get to see
why they call me...

207
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,471
"Proud Usopp", and not
"Pushover Usopp".

208
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,273
Is that clear?

209
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,109
You've already seen for yourself

210
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,111
just how good I am
with this thing, so,

211
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,780
you know I could rival
anyone carrying a pistol!

212
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,050
Now that you've drawn your
pistol, are you willing...

213
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,518
...to use it?

214
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,488
[USOPP gasps]

215
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,458
[LUFFY] Guns aren't for
threats, they're for actions.

216
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,727
Are you willing
to risk your life?

217
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,328
[ZORO chuckles]

218
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,401
[ZORO] I can assure you,
we're real pirates.

219
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,037
Consider your next
move very carefully.

Gah. Real pirates definitely
have a lot more punch

235
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,678
behind their words, 'cause
they can actually back 'em up!

236
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,147
That's so cool....

00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,148

Hm!

00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:35,654
[LUFFY, ZORO laugh]

239
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,956
I stole that!

240
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,023
[USOPP]
Huh?

241
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,126
[LUFFY] I stole those words
from Red Haired Shanks,

242
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,328
a pirate I know.

243
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,529
What?

244
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,831
You know Red Haired Shanks?
You really are a real pirate!

245
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,001
Wait, you gotta be lying,
do you really know him?

246
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,670
Yep! I know your dad too.

247
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,272
His name's Yasopp right?

248
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,607
[USOPP]
Huh?

249
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,613
[USOPP laughs, yelps]

250
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,715
[LUFFY chuckles]

251
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,184
[USOPP]
Uh... You're right.

252
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,020
My old man's name is Yasopp.

253
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,856
But, how?

254
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,058
How in the world
do you know him?

255
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,336
[USOPP]
This is good, huh?

256
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,741
So, I met your dad when
I was just a little kid.

257
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,076
Hold on, does my old
man really know Shanks?

258
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,079
Know him?! When I met your dad
he was a part of Shanks's crew,

259
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,215
so they were probably
pretty good friends.

260
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,383
I can't believe it!

261
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,986
My old man, sailing the high
seas with famous pirates.

262
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,721
[LUFFY] I haven't heard
from him in a while,

263
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,089
but I'll bet he's
still with them.

264
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,893
He was a heck of
a sharpshooter!

265
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,728
I'd keep him on my crew!

266
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,247
Whoa! Good shot!

267
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,915
Eh, That's nothing,

268
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,751
I could shoot an ant between
the eyes from across town!

269
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,422
[PIRATES chattering]

270
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:19,091
[YASOPP]
Ah! You know something, Luffy?

271
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,795
I got a kid named Usopp,
and he's just about your age!

272
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,296
You told me about him already.

273
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,397
A hundred times.

274
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,899
A hundred?

275
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,400
[LUFFY grunts]

276
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,935
Well, too bad!

277
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,438
I'm tellin' ya again!

278
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,773
It broke my heart to leave.

279
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,877
But I had to go.
You see, Luffy?

280
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,280
When the pirate flag beckons,
you must heed it's call!

[LUFFY grunting]

283
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,059
He used to go on and on
and on about his son.

284
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,462
I think I heard enough about
you to make my ears bleed!

285
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,998
And lemme tell you,
he was a great pirate!

286
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,733
Yeah? Really?

287
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,801
I sure am proud
of my old man.

288
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,939
He leapt into a pirate's
life on the endless sea.

289
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,775
And chose a life
of real adventure!

290
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,144
Maybe you can help us!

291
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,980
Do you know someone who could
provide us with a decent ship;

292
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,316
or even anyone who knows
how to sail for that matter?

293
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,420
[USOPP sighs] Well, It's a
pretty small village...

294
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:24,323
Sorry, but I just don't think
we'll be able to help you.

295
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,925
[ZORO]
What about that huge mansion?

296
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,825
[USOPP]
Ee!

297
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,028
The one on top of
that hill over there.

298
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,096
Hey! Do you know them, Usopp?

299
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,300
With all that money, surely they
could help us get our boat.

300
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,834
You stay away from there!

301
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,835
[NAMI, LUFFY, ZORO]
Huh?

302
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,837
Gah! Uh...

303
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,341
I just remembered something
that I really gotta do!

304
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,276
Everybody knows
me at this place,

305
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,146
So, uh, stay and eat
as much as you want!

306
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,981
Well, uh, gotta go!

307
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,386
Why was he in such a
hurry to get outta here?

308
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,185
[KLAHADORE]
You wish to see Usopp...

309
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,320
Don't start this, again.

310
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,421
May I see him?

311
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,657
I like talking to him.

[sighs] No, ma'am.

313
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,495
That man is, without a
doubt, a chronic liar.

314
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,330
For someone in your
weakened state,

315
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:42,101
Usopp's outlandish stories
might be too much to handle.

316
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,335
But I...

317
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,771
Your late parents instructed
me to protect you to the fullest

318
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,707
of my abilities. It would
be against their wishes

319
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,709
for you to see him, Miss Kaya.

320
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,445
Now then, I'll leave
your medicine right here.

321
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,347
Please be sure to take it.

323
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,055
[KLAHADORE]
"Killjoy" will do.

324
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,691

if you are kept safe.

[USOPP]
Pardon the intrusion... Ow!

327
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,749
[KAYA gasps]

328
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,484
Usopp! You came!

329
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,487
Of course! How are you?
You seem a little down.

330
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,588
[KAYA]
I guess I am.

331
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,223
I'm tired of talking like this,

332
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,226
I'd like to invite inside
like a proper guest,

333
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,630
but there's just no way
Klahadore would ever allow that.

334
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,565
He's not a bad person, though.

335
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,566
Don't sweat it!

336
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,401
Remember, I'm a brave
warrior of the sea,

337
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,603
who likes endless
oceans and the open sky!

338
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,572
Houses weren't made
for rogues like me.

339
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,175
I'd probably just feel
cramped in there. [laughs]

340
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,178
So, what adventure are you
going to tell me about today?

341
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,114
[USOPP]
Hmm. Well let's see...

342
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,248
Oh, I know!

343
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,417
What about the story of me
fighting a giant goldfish

344
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,619
at the south pole, when
I was only five years old!

345
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:08,754
[KAYA]
A goldfish?

346
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,522
[USOPP]
A giant goldfish!

347
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,525
What first astounded me was
the immense size of it's poop!

348
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,461
It was so big that
when I landed on it,

349
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,096
I thought it was solid ground.

350
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,664
It looked like an island!

351
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:25,704
[USOPP, KAYA laughing]

352
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,110
[KIDS]
Hm?

353
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,880
Are you sure this
is the place they took him?

354
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,882
Yeah, those terrible
pirates dragged him inside

355
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,617
and now it's up to us
to save our captain!

356
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,852
But, guys, those're
real pirates!

357
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,653
What if they've grilled
and eaten him already?

358
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,955
You idiot!

359
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,190
It's grisly old witch hags who
eat their victims, not pirates!

360
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,463
OK you guys, this
time it's for real.

361
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,464
[KIDS gulp]

362
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,301
This is gonna be the most brutal
and epic battle of our lives,

363
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,637
we must show no mercy because
they will never show it to us!

364
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,471
[KIDS]
Hm!

365
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,642
[KIDS] The Usopp
pirates, have arrived!

366
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,180
‐‐[LUFFY] Huh?
‐‐Who're these kids?

367
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,717
Captain Usopp is gone!

368
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,818
Did they...

369
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,887
Fess up, you filthy pirates!

370
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,655
What have you done with
our beloved Captain?!

371
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,756
Tell us now!

372
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,358
[ONION, CARROT]
Yeah! Tell us now!

373
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,494
[LUFFY sighs]
That meat sure was good!

374
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,762
‐‐[KIDS gasp]
‐‐What meat?

375
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,931
These pirates are cannibals!

376
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,533
[giggles]

377
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,435
What have you done, you savages?

378
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,404
[ZORO] If you're looking
for your captain...

379
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,774
...we ate him.

380
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,245
[KIDS]
Wah! Cannibals!

381
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,414
What are you punks
looking at me for?!

382
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,616
[LUFFY, ZORO laughing]

383
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,419
[NAMI] You just had to say
something stupid, didn't you?!

384
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,858
[PEPPER laughs]
You really had us going there.

385
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,532
[LUFFY]
Whoa! This place is huge!

386
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,467
And If our captain
ran off at this hour,

387
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,369
then this is the
place he's gonna be.

388
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,306
Oh... What in the world
does Usopp come here for?

389
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,574
He comes to lie.

390
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,375
To lie? That's terrible!

391
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,543
[PEPPER]
He's not a bad guy!

392
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,278
He's great! Isn't he?

393
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,713
Yeah! He's awesome!

394
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,616
How is a liar awesome?

395
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,385
[PEPPER] Well, Kaya,
the girl who lives there,

396
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,554
has been in a terrible
depression that's kept

397
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,990
her weak and in bed since
her parents got sick

398
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,992
and died a year ago.

399
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,461
She's very rich,
but all that money

400
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,897
couldn't help her
recover from her sadness.

401
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,399
[ONION] So our captain tells
his special made‐up stories

402
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,335
to make her laugh
and cheer her up!

403
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,271
[CARROT] Captain Usopp is
the best at telling lies!

404
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,743
Wow, that really is
pretty nice of him.

405
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,811
[KIDS]
Yeah!

406
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,513
The best thing about
him is his mischievous side,

407
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,514
he's always up to something!

408
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,284
I like him 'cause he's
not afraid to be silly!

409
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,586
And I like the
Captain's crazy lies!

410
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,421
So when he tells
her those stories,

411
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,489
he makes her feel better?

412
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,458
[CARROT]
Yep! Lot's better!

413
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,428
[LUFFY] Great! I think we should
ask her for a ship after all!

414
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,932
We're not the ones who make
her feel better, Usopp is.

415
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,966
[ONION]
Getting in is impossible!

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,436
Those guards at the gate
don't let anyone through!

417
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,505
‐‐[ALL] Uhh...
‐‐[CARROT] Where's Luffy?

418
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,774
‐‐I'll go ask her!
‐‐[ALL gasp]

419
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
[ZORO]
No! You're not gonna‐‐

420
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,511
[LUFFY]
Gum‐gum!

421
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,546
[KIDS yell]

422
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,948
His arms are all stretchy!

423
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,316
He's some kind of monster!

424
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,451
Pardon the intrusion...

425
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,686
[ZORRO]
N‐No, no, no, no!

426
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,356
‐‐LUFFY] Rocket!
‐‐[ALL yelling]

427
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,860
[USOPP] So after that terrifying
and traumatic little incident,

428
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:40,332
we escaped into the sky riding
on a giant slingshot ball!

429
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,466
What's that?

430
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,634
[USOPP]
Hm? Uh...

431
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,503

433
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:53,912
[LUFFY]
That worked well...

434
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,647
Yeah, real well!

435
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,582
My goodness, are you okay?

436
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,686
Uh... Don't mind them Kaya,
this happens to me all the time.

437
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,654
That's just the price of
being a famous adventurer!

438
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,356
They're just new recruits
who heard about me

439
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,491
and came to join
the Usopp pirates!

440
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,061
Nope, not me. I came
here to see you.

441
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,929
I wanted to ask you a favor.

442
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,597
A favor? From me?

443
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,498
[LUFFY]
Uh‐huh.

444
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,033
I was wondering if
there was any way

445
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,403
‐‐you could help us geta boat.
‐‐[KLAHADORE] You there!

446
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,038
What do you think you're doing?

447
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,077
Klahadore...

448
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,445
Get out!

449
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,682

is criminal trespassing.
