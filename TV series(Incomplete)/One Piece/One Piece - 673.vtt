WEBVTT

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.214
[cackles]

00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:34.455
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:36.259
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.430
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:42.805
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.149
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:41.022
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:46.332
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.805
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:52.111
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.144 --> 00:02:53.981
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.014 --> 00:02:56.353
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:59.124
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:03.466
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.036
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.944
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:13.052
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.457 --> 00:03:16.760
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.631
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.901
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.406
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.978
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:27.915
Luffy had intended to
win a tournament that

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.153
promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:33.628
but abandoned that plan when
Law was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:36.499
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:40.173
[DWARVES scream]

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.346
[USOPP]
Leo! Buddy!

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.283
You gotta be more careful!

00:03:45.316 --> 00:03:46.920
You shouldn't have
made him angry!

00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:50.995
We'll finish Operation S.O.P.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:56.005
Our friends...
are counting on us.

00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.646
I believe in the commander.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.120
We have to help him
defeat Doflamingo.

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:06.359
We won't stop until he does!

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:09.164
Say, Rebecca, here's a question.

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.772
Do you happen to know how
your dear mother Scarlet died?

00:04:14.308 --> 00:04:18.551
[chuckles] I saw
the Toy Soldier that day.

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.957
He cried like a baby. Pathetic.

00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:25.397
[DAIKON]
You stay right here!

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.167
[CUB]
Are you all right, Commander?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.671
Yes, thank you.

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:29.773
We gotta move.

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:32.712
Hold on! They'll be hurt
if we don't help them!

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:35.483
[LAO G] Get your paws off me,
you little bastards!

00:04:35.518 --> 00:04:38.489
Stop looking back,
Commander! Just go!

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.532
We're ready. We all knew
what we signed up for.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:43.768
Don't say that!

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:46.673
If you stay here,
then everyone might die!

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:51.650
Even if Leo pulls of Operation
S.O.P., it's still not over.

00:04:51.683 --> 00:04:53.721
If we let Doflamingo walk away,

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.892
he can do the same
thing all over again.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:56.960
Or even worse!

00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.964
No one else can beat Doflamingo!

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.837
We're counting on you
for that! Keep fighting!

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.039
He's worth it!

00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:05.845
We're proud to bet
everything we've got on him!

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:11.523
[LEO] Nobody remembers
him now, but years ago,

00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:14.495
everyone in the kingdom
knew who he was.

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.967
Before he got
transformed into a toy,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.436
his name was...

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.906
...Kyros!

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:22.846
[LEO]
He was the strongest gladiator

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.316
that the coliseum had ever seen!

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.423
That's who our commander is!

00:05:28.456 --> 00:05:30.594
A legendary hero!

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:38.175
[LUFFY] "The Rupture Man!
Gladius Blows Up Big Time!"

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.629
All that work and I
couldn't even make a dent?

00:07:00.675 --> 00:07:02.444
What's the trick here?

00:07:02.477 --> 00:07:04.549
There has to be someplace
I can cut this bastard

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:06.318
that'll take him down for good.

00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:18.209
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES yelling]

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:19.479
Smash him to bits!

00:07:19.513 --> 00:07:22.918
I don't have time for
the likes of you!

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.995
[yells]

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:39.686
[RAMPO yells]

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:46.900
Rampo, no!

00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:55.483
[KYROS]
Are you all right?

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.087
Thanks to you!

00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:00.460
Were you hurt?

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:02.197
Just a little scratch!

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.368
I can keep fighting,
don't you worry!

00:08:04.402 --> 00:08:07.107
I know they'll pull through
with Operation S.O.P.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.146
In the meantime, all we gotta
do is get you to Doflamingo!

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.452
In no time at all, you're gonna
be back to your old self!

00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:16.560
Then nobody in the world will be
able to stand in your way!

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:18.462
I hope that's the case.

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:23.172
Huh?

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:27.515
Oh no. It can't be.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.560
That's not good!
We've got another Executive!

00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:39.171
He's a member of the
Pica Army. Gladius!

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:46.753
You can't beat him
in your current form.

00:08:46.786 --> 00:08:49.893
Rampo and I will draw his
attention and you run ahead.

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:50.961
That's the only way!

00:08:50.994 --> 00:08:52.397
Don't you dare!

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.870
I won't have you sacrifice
yourselves on my behalf!

00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:56.573
Rampo!

00:08:56.607 --> 00:08:58.543
We'll attack from
both sides at once!

00:08:58.577 --> 00:08:59.779
[CUB]
Roger!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:01.983
No, wait!

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.193
[GLADIUS] Can't believe I'm
stuck exterminating these rats.

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:15.611
[RAMPO yells]

00:09:15.645 --> 00:09:17.080
You ready?

00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:18.283
[GLADIUS]
Hmph.

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:19.285
[gasps]

00:09:19.318 --> 00:09:20.754
[CUB groans]

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:23.794
[gasps]

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:27.735
[GLADIUS]
Maybe you're more like insects.

00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.242
Damn it!

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:32.745
Let them go!

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:39.626
Commander!

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.495
Now is your chance!

00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:46.205
[CUB groans]

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:48.677
[RAMPO groans]

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:58.697
[yells]

00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:04.407
[GLADIUS]
You think a toy can outrun me?

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:15.463
[GLADIUS] I ate the Pop Pop
Fruit and became a Rupture Man.

00:10:18.135 --> 00:10:20.373
[GLADIUS] That means
I can detonate my body

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:22.945
without causing harm to myself.

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:24.481
But that's not all.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:30.059
[GLADIUS] I can also detonate
anything inorganic.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.604
[GLADIUS] Though a toy like you
won't survive the process.

00:10:35.637 --> 00:10:36.940
[KYROS]
Don't you dare!

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:38.877
I refuse to die!

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:45.924
[KYROS]
Someone is counting on me!

00:10:51.637 --> 00:10:54.140
[KYROS]
Rebecca!

00:10:54.174 --> 00:10:56.747
[GLADIUS] Looks like you're
ready to burst, little toy!

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.721
[LUFFY grunts]
Jet Stamp!

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:08.970
[GLADIUS]
Who did that?

00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:12.578
Soldier! Have you seen my crew?

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.081
You saved me.

00:11:14.114 --> 00:11:15.851
Franky made it sound
like he was with you.

00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:18.924
There's no time! You can
talk later, Straw Hat!

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.865
[GLADIUS]
So that's who it is. Violet!

00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:24.836
[gasps] Gladius!

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:26.973
[GLADIUS]
You little traitor.

00:11:29.345 --> 00:11:33.219
[GLADIUS] You'll pay for turning
your back on the young master.

00:11:33.253 --> 00:11:34.388
Oh, you wanna fight?

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:35.658
What did I just say?

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:36.960
Let go!

00:11:36.994 --> 00:11:39.498
[VIOLET] We have to run!
Trust me. He's strong.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:40.734
We'd be trapped here.

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:41.903
We have to end this!

00:11:41.936 --> 00:11:43.606
Just head for the Suit Chamber!

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.813
Lady Viola,
you're helping us now?

00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:48.049
You recognize me?

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:51.255
Of course! Although I'm sure
that you've forgotten me.

00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.393
That may be so,
but I've been watching you

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:55.731
with my clairvoyance
for quite some time.

00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:57.000
You and Rebecca, as well.

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.202
What?

00:11:58.235 --> 00:12:01.677
I know it's been hard.
So, thank you.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.145
[GLADIUS]
Get back here!

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:07.955
[GLADIUS] Your treachery
won't go unpunished, Violet.

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:11.730
[GLADIUS]
You're dead!

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.734
I've never been on your side!

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.537
You give yourself
too much credit!

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:18.777
For ten whole years, I've been
waiting for this opportunity!

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.819
[GLADIUS] I won't hear your
venomous words any longer!

00:12:22.852 --> 00:12:24.487
Helmet Pop!

00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:27.460
[VIOLET gasps]

00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:35.878
[KYROS]
Lady Viola!

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.180
Oh no!

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:42.692
I'm sorry, I should've
caught that.

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:44.495
Didn't get hurt
too bad, did you?

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.633
I was just grazed
by some shrapnel.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.035
Keep heading up, okay?

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:49.706
[LUFFY] It doesn't matter
how we get there, right?

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:50.808
[VIOLET]
Where are you going?

00:12:50.841 --> 00:12:53.012
The staircase is the other way!

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:54.916
[LUFFY yells]

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:56.753
[VIOLET gasps]

00:12:59.525 --> 00:13:00.359
This is bad.

00:13:00.393 --> 00:13:01.462
What are you doing?

00:13:01.495 --> 00:13:03.032
That should work.

00:13:07.508 --> 00:13:08.743
[GLADIUS groans]

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.318
[GLADIUS]
Where did they go?

00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:20.400
[footsteps]

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:23.372
[GLADIUS] Young Master?
Why're you here?

00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:27.916
Young Master?

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.120
Sorry I'm not aware
of any such person.

00:13:30.153 --> 00:13:31.388
I am Don Quixote--

00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.696
The Doflamingo Family
calls him "Young Master"!

00:13:34.729 --> 00:13:36.632
That would be me.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.118
[GLADIUS] There are some
intruders in the palace.

00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.657
You might want to wait upstairs
until we take care of them.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.328
Upstairs? I shall
do no such thing.

00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:53.366
You may do as you wish
with the intruders,

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.969
but I'm heading underground.

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:57.508
I have business with Kanjuro.

00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:58.877
[GLADIUS]
Kanjuro?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.217
The samurai who disappeared
from the junkyard?

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.553
That's the one.

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:06.859
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll
go meet that missing samurai.

00:14:06.893 --> 00:14:10.132
Huh? Did you say
he went missing?

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:30.306
[KYROS] Well, that certainly
was effective, wasn't it?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.509
It's not time yet--
You have to wait!

00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:33.647
First we have to hurry
and now we have to wait?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.615
Mingo is right there!

00:14:34.648 --> 00:14:36.686
[VIOLET]
Shh.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.688
Huh?

00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:38.957
Just calm down!

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:41.429
The Tontatta still
need time to finish!

00:14:41.462 --> 00:14:42.798
Finish what?

00:14:42.832 --> 00:14:45.236
You don't know about
Operation S.O.P.?

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:47.641
Well, the details
aren't important.

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:50.146
The point is, we can't
fight Doflamingo yet.

00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.131
I thought your
only objective was

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.435
to destroy the SMILE factory.

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.707
So what about Straw Hat?

00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.280
His crew is teaming up with the
Little People from Green Bit.

00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:09.585
Would you mind telling me why?

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:12.958
Even for them, that seems
a bit capricious, doesn't it?

00:15:14.093 --> 00:15:15.396
Little People?

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.566
While you're at it,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.137
tell me how they snuck into
the underground port.

00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:27.187
But why did they decide
to target Sugar?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.990
I can't figure out
their motivations

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:31.429
or how they arrived
at this plan,

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:35.436
but they're doing a good job
of pissing me off.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.377
At this point, it's looking like
more than a simple coincidence.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.114
That's not good.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.624
[DOFLAMINGO] Because that
would mean they know

00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:48.796
about this kingdom's
dark secrets.

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:54.943
Don't just sit there!

00:15:54.976 --> 00:15:57.614
The young master's
speaking to you, Law!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.060
[BUFFALO] Don't do it if
it's gonna make you cry!

00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:06.833
I swear, you two never change.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:09.104
I already told you.

00:16:09.138 --> 00:16:12.110
I don't have anything
to do with them anymore.

00:16:12.144 --> 00:16:14.682
Our alliance ended.

00:16:14.716 --> 00:16:18.388
Whatever they're doing out
there, it's none of my business.

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:23.366
I honestly can't tell if
you're trying to fool me or not.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:28.008
It's hard to believe, but maybe
you're as clueless as you say.

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:44.440
A pity Violet isn't here.

00:16:44.474 --> 00:16:47.582
She could see right through
you if you were lying.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:49.050
By the way.

00:16:49.083 --> 00:16:50.988
You wouldn't happen to
know anything about this,

00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:52.825
would you, King Riku?

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.500
The Tontatta were rather
fond of you, if I recall.

00:17:00.273 --> 00:17:03.178
[VIOLET]
Father? Why is he here?

00:17:03.212 --> 00:17:05.784
[LUFFY]
Traffy's okay, that's good.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:10.760
[KYROS] King Riku! After all
these years, you're still alive!

00:17:12.097 --> 00:17:14.201
Your name is Kyros, huh?

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:16.304
Why don't you
come with me, friend?

00:17:17.307 --> 00:17:20.614
[KYROS]
I will save you. I swear it.

00:17:22.852 --> 00:17:26.225
C'mon! Let's go kick
Mingo's ass already!

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.462
We still have to wait
for the Tontatta!

00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:30.667
[KYROS]
Did something happen to Leo?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.370
Our window for
victory is narrow,

00:17:32.404 --> 00:17:35.476
but as long as he can restore
the toys to their human form,

00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:37.748
I'll have my chance to
strike down Doflamingo

00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:40.119
once and for all.

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:43.158
My friends put their lives
on the line to protect me.

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.697
I will not fail,
no matter the cost!

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.935
I'm counting on you, Leo.

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:49.404
Usoland!

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.979
[chuckles]

00:18:23.172 --> 00:18:25.744
Hey, buddy. You okay?

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:30.854
[panting] The battle
isn't over yet.

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:32.958
I just need to pick myself up.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:35.631
I can't let everyone down.

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:37.701
They're doing
their best, after all,

00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:39.938
so that the mission
doesn't fail.

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.041
Leo!

00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:09.765
You're still going for this?

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:12.037
[LEO]
Of course I am!

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.040
If we can't knock Sugar out,

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:17.446
the commander and all the
other toys won't become human!

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:21.589
We need their strength
to win this.

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:28.402
[LEO] The commander
placed his faith in us,

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.807
to make Sugar pass out.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.178
So I'm gonna carry out my duty!

00:19:34.615 --> 00:19:36.819
[USOPP]
I can't believe these guys!

00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:46.573
What do you guys want?

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:48.142
So annoying.

00:19:48.175 --> 00:19:49.746
[LEO]
We're not going anywhere until

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:52.183
we complete Operation S.O.P.

00:19:52.216 --> 00:19:55.557
And after that, we're gonna
save our captive friends,

00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:59.130
restore the Riku Dynasty,
and finally,

00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:02.002
topple your corrupt rule
of this kingdom!

00:20:06.712 --> 00:20:08.015
Time to attack!

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:11.154
[DWARVES yell]

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:16.565
[chuckles] You dummies!

00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:24.413
[DWARVES gasp]

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:28.054
[DWARVES gasp]

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:37.975
[DWARVES scream]

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:38.843
[gasps]

00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:39.946
[ROBIN gasps]

00:20:39.979 --> 00:20:42.349
[SUGAR] All right,
little bears, stop napping!

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:46.492
[DWARF A]
Please don't make me do this!

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:48.329
[DWARF B]
I don't wanna fight my friends!

00:20:48.362 --> 00:20:50.366
[DWARF C]
Somebody, help!

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.705
Now charge! Kill them all!

00:20:52.738 --> 00:20:58.081
[DWARVES yelling]

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.578
You don't have to
fight until you die!

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:15.583
You gave it your best,
now run away!

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:19.391
[LEO yells]

00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:22.764
Buncha dopes! They really
are hopeless, aren't they?

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:24.133
[ROBIN]
Maybe so.

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:31.749
But still. I like them that way.

00:21:31.782 --> 00:21:33.553
They'll see you!

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:44.274
[chuckles] You can barely stand
and you want to fight me?

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:46.244
Doce Fleurs!

00:21:46.277 --> 00:21:49.150
Huh? Whoa, what's going on here?

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:50.253
Huh?

00:21:50.286 --> 00:21:53.593
[gasps] What's with
these arms? This is gross!

00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:54.828
Leo!

00:21:54.862 --> 00:21:56.098
Robiland, it's you!

00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.735
I don't know how long
I can hold her--

00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:00.506
You need to put the
grape in her mouth now!

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:04.313
I won't let you down.

00:22:12.897 --> 00:22:14.467
Almost there!

00:22:17.574 --> 00:22:18.709
[ROBIN gasps]

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:25.790
[gasps]

00:22:28.061 --> 00:22:29.463
[gasps]

00:22:31.234 --> 00:22:34.006
You've caused us
enough trouble, 'kay?

00:22:40.887 --> 00:22:43.626
Leo, no! [screams]

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.195
What just happened?

00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:48.301
I thought he was gonna make it,
but now I can't remember why!

00:22:49.505 --> 00:22:50.607
[LEO gasps]

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:57.052
[TREBOL chuckles]

00:22:57.086 --> 00:23:00.259
You didn't actually think
you could beat us?

00:23:14.688 --> 00:23:17.995
[NARRATOR] Operation S.O.P. has
become a catastrophic failure.

00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:19.397
Without a hint of mercy,

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.470
Trebol crushes one
Tontatta after another.

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:24.875
But even as their friends
cry out in torment,

00:23:24.908 --> 00:23:27.548
they never lose hope,
because they still believe that

00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:30.452
the legendary hero
Usoland will save them.

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:32.724
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.757 --> 00:23:35.664
"A Liar!
Usoland on the Run!"

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.301
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
