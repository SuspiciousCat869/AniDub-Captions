00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,415
it'll take half of
Alabasta with it!

177
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,756
The entire Grand Line's
gonna be blown to the moon!

178
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,134
Hey! Ya there?!

179
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,269
I'm here.

180
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,803
[SCORPION gasps]

181
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,739
Wh‐What happened to the bomb?!

182
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,707
Why didn't it go off?!

183
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,608
This thing?

184
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,379
[SCORPION yells]

185
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,480
[LUFFY laughs]

186
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,149
You're one hilarious old guy!
Heh heh!

187
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,485
[SCORPION growls]
Stop laughing, ya little brat!

188
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,553
It's not funny!

189
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,121
Now hurry and help me up!

190
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,460
[SCORPION]
Where is he?! Where'd he go?!

191
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,462
Don't tell me I lost him!

192
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,465
[growls] Dammit! This is
the last thing I need!

193
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,635
I can't afford to
lose him now! Popo!

194
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,637
We're heading out
to where I last saw him!

195
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,638
[POPO squawks]

196
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,243
My brother and I have been on
his trail and I know he's close.

197
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,245
We followed him
from the Badlands.

198
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,315
[USOPP]
We need more details.

199
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,182
What's his name?

200
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,984
[DIP]
Scorpion. He's a bounty hunter.

201
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,918
Hold on... You sure?

202
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,187
What possible reason
would you kids have

203
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,789
for chasing a bounty hunter?

204
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,823
Well, uh...

205
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,327
[ACE] I have business
with him as well.

206
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,330
A man who defeated
Blackbeard is somewhere in Yuba.

207
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,965
He goes by the name Scorpion.

208
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,800
My whole purpose
for traveling to Yuba

209
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,001
is to meet this man.

210
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,271
[GROUP] That guy...
defeated Blackbeard?!

211
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,173
[USOPP]
No way! I don't believe it.

212
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,677
[SCORPION]
Yah!

213
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,613
Faster!

214
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,815
Come on, Popo, we'll
find that sneaky pirate

215
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,317
and give him the
fight of his life!

216
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,019
[laughs]
You're a lucky boy!

217
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,821
You get to witness
a huge battle!

218
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,656
Me, the world's
greatest‐up‐and coming

219
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,458
bounty hunter,
locked in combat

220
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,792
with one of the
most vile fiends

221
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,562
to ever cross these
sand‐covered parts!

222
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,632
Really? You're a bounty
hunter, old man?!

223
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,533
[SCORPION] Don't be frightened
when I tell you that I've been

224
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,402
on many a
heart‐pounding adventure!

225
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,903
I've fought epic
battles with everyone

226
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,706
from Double‐Barrel Danny
to Hell‐Battler Luther

227
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,575
and every fight
ended with my opponent

228
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,043
begging me for his life!

229
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,044
[LUFFY]
Wow!

230
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,513
Your name must be known
throughout the world!

231
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,649
No, but someday! Soon!

232
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,716
[laughing]

233
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,385
[LUFFY]
You'll be famous!

234
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,986
[laughing]

235
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,354
[SCORPION]
I'll tell ya this much...

236
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,889
I'm gonna beat Fire Fist Ace!

237
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,325
After him, everyone else
should be a cinch!

238
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,394
[LUFFY] Wait, you're looking
to pick a fight with Ace?!

239
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,497
This I gotta see! [laughing]

240
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,267
Easy! You be mindful
not to mock me, boy!

241
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,071
Whenever I do something,
I make sure and do it right!

242
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,874
A man should live his life
to the fullest and set aim

243
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,444
for big ambitions!
It's important I show 'em that!

244
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,580
Excuse me? Show who?

245
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,917
Here comes Scorpion!

246
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,388
The gallant hunter!

247
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,209
[USOPP]
I dunno, Ace...

248
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,478
He doesn't look the type...

249
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,246
Do you really think
that this is the guy

250
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,548
who beat up Blackbeard?

251
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,449
Not sure.

252
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,150
The only way to find
out is to meet him

253
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,385
face‐to‐face.

254
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,088
[CHIP] Ace?
Wait, you don't mean the real‐‐

255
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,224
[DIP]
The real Fire Fist Ace?!

256
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,399
[USOPP]
What is it?

257
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,468
There's two... maybe a bird.

258
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,337
Chopper?

259
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,438
They're here!

260
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,975
[footsteps]

261
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,583
I've come for you,
Fire Fist Ace!

262
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,251
[GROUP]
Huh?

263
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,986
I'm the Scorpion!

264
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,955
A true, indomitable hero!

265
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,090
I've traveled a great
distance to challenge you!

266
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,026
I expect an above‐board fight,
fair and square!

267
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,296
It's him... That's Scorpion.

268
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,165
Oh, goody! You're all here...

269
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,666
[GROUP]
Uh... Luffy!

270
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,035
Uh... Why are you
riding with the Scorpion?!

271
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,270
He's the enemy!

272
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,945
[SCORPION] It's really him!
Fire Fist Ace in the flesh!

273
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,380
What's wrong, Scorpion?

274
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,515
It's... uh...

275
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,517
[laughing]

276
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,518
So sorry!

277
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,653
But this is the day
that your luck runs out!

278
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,890
All those heroic songs and tales
your supporters flatter you with

279
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,024
ends today!

280
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,859
Don't be stupid. Turn back!

281
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,297
[LUFFY laughs]
This is so exciting!

282
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,033
Ace! It's a serious fight,
so don't pull any punches!

283
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,568
[ACE]
I wasn't planning to!

284
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,538
But before we fight,
there's something I wanna know!

285
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,339
[SCORPION]
Why am I falling apart?!

286
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,707
This is what I wanted!

287
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,209
I won't wimp out now!

288
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,911
I'm invulnerable! I can't die!

289
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,547
Not as long as I remember
that they need me!

290
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,549
Ready? Here I come!

291
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,351
[SCORPION yelling]

292
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,158
You're finished!

293
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,194
[LUFFY laughs]

294
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,070
[SCORPION]
Ah! Crap, crap, crap!

295
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,105
[yelling]

296
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,241
Ow! H‐H‐Hot! Hot! Hot!

297
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,412
Whoa... Ace just threw
the net right back at him!

298
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,519
[SCORPION laughing]

299
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,254
I guess I should be thankful.

300
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,589
If defeating you were easy,

301
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,959
it wouldn't be
much of a victory! Ha ha!

302
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,528
Yeah? Well, you have
some skills yourself.

303
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,364
I'm glad you approve
because this fight isn't over!

304
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,634
Popo! The Compressed
Extinguisher Gun!

305
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,376
A special compressed‐air gun
filled with extinguisher foam!

306
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,777
Uh... It's what?!

307
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,112
Does it work?!

308
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,447
Don't be fooled by the foam!

309
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,482
This bad boy packs enough
power to blow a hole

310
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,050
clean through ya!

311
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,952
[yelling]

312
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,628
[SCORPION groans]

313
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,334
It was a nice try,
but you never had a chance,

314
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,402
my friend.

315
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,137
[ACE]
I suspected as much.

316
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,573
You lied about beating
Blackbeard, didn't you?

317
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,408
You figured using his
name would draw me

318
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,643
out into the open.

319
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,677
Am I right?

320
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,245
[SCORPION coughs]

321
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,346
That's right.

322
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,316
A clever deceit?

323
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,418
[chuckles]

324
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,353
[coughs]

325
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,656
I'd say that first
round was a draw.

326
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,791
Now it's time to get serious!

327
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,428
[DIP] Stop!
You can't beat him, Father!

328
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,296
[GROUP]
Huh?

329
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,430
Did he say father?

330
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,602
[coughing]

331
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,304
Son... I'll be fine!

332
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,106
[DIP]
Stop the fight!

333
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,276
[SCORPION]
Oh! Chip! Dip!

334
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,044
[CHIP, DIP]
Father!

335
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,512
[DIP]
You don't have to do this!

336
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,647
Fire Fist Ace is too powerful!

337
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,116
What're you doing here?
Why aren't you at home!

338
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,651
When did you
leave the Badlands?!

339
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,527
Father! Look here!

340
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,529
Isn't this the biggest
potato you've ever seen

341
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,863
in your life?

342
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,799
Yes! That is a big one!

343
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,867
[laughing]

344
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,303
[CHIP]
Ah! We sure are lucky!

345
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,538
Think of all the
people out there

346
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,373
who didn't get to
eat a potato today.

347
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,076
I wonder what it feels like to
eat until your tummy gets full.

348
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,311
[DIP]
You idiot! Keep your voice down!

349
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,215
How do ya think Dad would feel
if he heard you say that?!

350
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,550
He gave up his dream
of bounty‐hunting

351
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,185
so he could support us!

352
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,555
[CHIP] Dip, I've heard
stories about a hero

353
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,357
who travels across
the sea and goes on

354
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,658
big adventures.

355
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,159
Do ya think maybe
you and me will ever

356
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,561
get to do somethin' like that?

357
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,162
[DIP]
Of course not!

358
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,564
We're gonna live our
entire lives here,

359
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,499
working this withered land,
just like Father.

360
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,234
So, don't waste time dreaming.

361
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,169
Haven't ya learned
anything from him?

362
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,438
Dreams don't ever happen
in the real world!

363
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,576
Thought I taught you
boys better than that!

364
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,578
Think I did all this
so you'd stay here?

365
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,912
But Father!

366
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,714
Dreams are all that's
worth having in this world

367
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,350
and I'll prove it!
I'll track down Fire Fist Ace

368
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,552
and defeat him in the
world's greatest battle!

369
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,587
My dream!

370
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,589
Then I'll return home
to you boys and we'll see

371
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,457
how worthless you think
a man's dreams are!

372
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,932
Please, we understand now

373
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,567
what you've been
trying to teach us!

374
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,103
This battle's too much for you!
Ya gotta come home!

375
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,072
[laughing]

376
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,940
Don't be silly.
Remember, boys,

377
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,276
I'm the world's greatest
bounty hunter, after all!

378
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,912
If I've said it once,
I've said it a million times.

379
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,280
I've fought the
toughest, meanest men

380
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,082
around and bested every one!

381
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,950
Dad, you don't have to lie.

382
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,219
[SCORPION laughs]
You found me out!

383
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,723
The truth is I'm a terrible liar
and a terrible father to boot.

384
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,591
But there is one
thing that's true!

385
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,293
And if you remember
nothing else I've taught you,

386
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,928
remember this...

387
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,297
Even the most insignificant
person can rise up

388
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,965
to challenge the
world's greatest hero

389
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,967
if he believes in himself!

390
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,603
That is the entire
reason I did this!

391
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,805
To show you...

392
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,974
Show you boys what it means
to follow your heart's desire!

393
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,644
Men need dreams.
Goals that burn

394
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,813
deep inside the heart
like an eternal flame!

395
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,314
That is what sustains us all!

396
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,348
Ambition!

397
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,317
Always challenge what
others say can't be done,

398
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,985
even if it seems impossible.

399
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,121
Believe, and life
will deliver paradise!

400
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,689
[laughing]

401
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,658
Forgive me, but the
only way to make you

402
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,661
see this truth was to
put my life on the line!

403
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,262
My sons!

404
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,298
Always... follow your heart!

405
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,968
Wait, Father!

406
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,969
Watch and learn!

407
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,972
Witness your father's
unconquerable spirit!

408
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,642
So long as I hold
on to my dream...

409
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,179
I won't back down!
Do you hear me, Ace?!

410
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,051
Popo! The bazooka!

411
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,655
Prepare yourself!
This is the end!

412
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,959
I won't let you do it!
We need you!

413

Get down! Take cover!

414
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,029
We understand! You had to leave
us to make your point.

415
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:51,897
We get it, Father!

416
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,799
Chip and I won't
give up on our dreams,

417
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,700
just like you said!

418
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,369
Now please listen
to us and stop fighting!

419
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,171
Come home!
We need you around!

420

That's our dream!

I'm sorry, Daddy!
Don't be mad at us anymore!

422
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,878
We'll be good! I promise!
And I won't complain ever again!

423
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,847
I'm scared, Daddy!
I wanna go home!

424
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,315
We love you, Father!

425
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,817

leave my sons behind?

Well, then...

You're not really going to
leave us, Ace, are you?

449
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,451
[ACE] Yep. Seeing as how it's
been confirmed Blackbeard

450
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,687
isn't in Alabasta, I have
no reason to stick around.

Any idea where
you'll be headed next?

453
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,759
I have a lead to
Blackbeard's whereabouts.

454
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,095
Scorpion heard about
a man who saw him out west.

455

Guess we'll see... Luffy.

Hey, do yourself a
favor and hang on to that.

But it's just a scrap of paper.

458

will reunite us some day.

for all of you to handle,

of him for me.
