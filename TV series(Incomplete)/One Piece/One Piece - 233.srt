1
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,248
Eheheh!

2
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,649
Ah!

3
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,786
So, how much do you think
the repairs are gonna cost?

4
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,554
We've got plenty
of money to spend.

5
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,390
And no price is too
high for our Merry!

6
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,093
Her battle scars are
far worse than you think.

7
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,828
Uhm... Then you're
saying it's gonna

8
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,730
take a long time
for you to fix her?

9
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,466
No, Ma'am. It's
not about the time,

10
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,301
it's not about skill, either.

11
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,341
I'm saying no one can
fix her. Not even us.

12
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,575
No way.

13
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:25,579
We... We've gone everywhere
without any problems until now!

14
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,782
In theory, even if we
did everything we could.

15
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,653
The probability of your ship
lasting till the next island...

16
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,722
[gulps]

17
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,456
[KAKU]
...is zero.

18
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,702
Merry tell me.

19
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,804
Is what he said true?

20
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,139
You'll never sail again?

21
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,521
This sucks.

22
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,622
I'm sorry, Sanji.

23
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,090
I was so focused
on the books

24
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,293
that I didn't
notice when she left.

25
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:14,728
There's nothing you
should have to apologize for.

26
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,364
I just assumed that the
person I saw walking with Robin

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,799
had to have been you
in your human form.

28
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,436
Which begs the question:

29
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,305
"Who was that masked man?

30
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,441
And how were they able
to disappear so suddenly?"

31
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:32,680
Yeah. Even Robin's
scent disappeared.

32
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,716
I hope everything's
all right. I feel uneasy.

33
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,453
Do you need an examination?

34
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:41,388
No! That's not what I meant!

35
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:46,060
It's what Aokiji said.
His words keep repeating.

36
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,728
What did he say
that worries you?

37
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,198
It was all that terrible stuff
he said about Robin's past.

38
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,335
And that very soon we'd
regret her being on our crew.

39
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:57,404
Oh yeah, right. So do you
think what he said might

40
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,740
have had something to do
with her disappearance?

41
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,475
I don't know.

42
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,811
But I know we're getting
nowhere looking for her.

43
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,447
Let's head back
to the ship for now.

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,381
If nothing's wrong,

45
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,450
she'll come back on
her own eventually.

46
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,185
Yeah, you're right.

47
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,086
[SANJI]
Hurry back to the Merry.

48
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,651
What? You can't fix the
Going Merry? Why not?!

49
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,152
I thought all of
you were supposed

50
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,455
to be awesome shipwrights!

51
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,690
Don't worry about the money!

52
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,292
Look! We've got plenty!

53
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,393
[KAKU] It's not
about the money, son.

54
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,630
No matter how much you pay.

55
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,733
That ship can't be restored
to how she used to be.

56
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,102
To be honest,

57
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm rather impressed
you were able

58
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,173
to get that ol' girl this
far considering the condition

59
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,408
that she's currently in.

60
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,043
What's that supposed to mean?

61
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,078
What exactly is going
on with the Merry?

62
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,081
Do you know what the
"keel" is, Immoral Girl?

63
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,215
[NAMI]
Immor--?!

64
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,151
The thing at the
bottom of the boat?

65
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,218
Yeah.

66
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,088
It's the most important
piece of lumber on a ship.

67
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,092
It crosses from stem to
stern and provides support.

68
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,395
When you build a ship, you
start off by placing the keel.

69
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,765
Then, you set the wood for
the stem, the stern, the frame,

70
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,168
frame brackets, and deck beams.

71
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,204
All of the pieces are
carefully assembled together,

72
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,574
with the keel
serving as the core.

73
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,509
It's the very
backbone, framework,

74
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,612
and life of every
vessel constructed.

75
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:48,082
And when it's severely damaged,
then that's the end of her.

76
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,317
You can't just replace
it with a new one.

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,184
That would be the same thing

78
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,688
as building a new
ship from scratch.

79
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,492
That's the reason we, or anyone,
won't be able to fix her.

80
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,062
Your ship's just a bunch of wood
stuck together awaiting her end.

81
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,799
Hey, you! Don't say
such horrible things!

82
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:10,070
Horrible or not,
it's the truth.

83
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,271
Okay, fine then!

84
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,341
Just rebuild her from the
ground up, like you said before!

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,143
Build another Going Merry!

86
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,746
Coo coo! Sorry, not possible!

87
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,114
Why not?

88
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,449
We could build you
a very similar ship.

89
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,653
But no one could build you one
that would be exactly the same.

90
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,489
Nowhere in the world are there
two completely identical ships.

91
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,124
It simply can't be done.

92
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,325
What do you mean? Why?

93
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,093
Tell me, are there
any trees in the world

94
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,129
that grow exactly the same way?

95
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,397
Huh?

96
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,199
A sailing ship is mostly
built out of lumber.

97
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,068
So the overall size
and shape of a vessel

98
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,270
is determined by
the type of wood used.

99
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,706
That's why an exact duplicate
of your ship can't be built

100
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,410
by us or anyone, even when
using the same blueprints.

101
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,279
If we made a ship like that,
with those specifications.

102
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,181
The ones who would
notice the difference

103
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,750
and feel that it's a
completely different ship

104
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,621
would be all of
you guys! Coo coo!

105
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,224
No way. So, you're saying
it's absolutely impossible

106
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,094
for us to continue
sailing on the Going Merry?

107
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,562
Unfortunately, yes.

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,732
You can either wait
around for her to sink.

109
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,636
Or you can dismantle
her immediately.

110
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,338
[NAMI]
A real caravel!

111
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,472
[LUFFY]
What a cool ship!

112
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:22,576
Have you guys seen the front?
It's totally awesome!

113
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,179
Okay! It's all done!

114
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,080
Now the Going Merry

115
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,351
has everything she
could possibly need!

116
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,153
[ICEBERG] Mmwell, your
ship is on her last legs.

117
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,489
Why don't you look at
this as an opportunity?

118
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,224
You happen to be in the
best place in the world

119
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,425
to buy a new ship.

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,359
You have money, right?

121
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,663
I understand that
your ship was a caravel.

122
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,232
Sailing on the Grand Line
in an old ship like that

123
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,135
would be difficult
to begin with.

124
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,404
No way. We're not
getting a new ship.

125
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,772
[NAMI]
Luffy...

126
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,208
The Merry is...

127
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,111
The Going Merry is the ship
of the Straw Hat pirates!

128
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,413
If she's repaired,
then she can still sail!

129
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,148
She'll be fine! You'll see!

130
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,217
She got us here
today, didn't she?

131
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,220
And you tell us out of nowhere
she can't sail anymore?

132
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:08,322
I can't believe that! I won't!

133
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,691
You guys are saying that
because you don't know her.

134
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,495
You have no idea
how strong she is!

135
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:18,432
Then your plan is to keep
sailing her until she sinks?

136
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,066
I'm shocked.

137
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,171
So, this is the decision
of a ship's captain?!

138
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,046
This discussion is over
for now. Just think about it.

139
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,148
If you decide to buy
a ship, let me know.

140
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,416
My people can help.

141
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,151
If you're able to
spend 300 million,

142
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:41,622
we can build a state-of-the-art
ship for you. Kalifa!

143
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,524
Here, if you'd look
this over, please.

144
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,226
It's a catalogue of our
new and our used models.

145
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,795
Use it as a price reference.

146
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,497
Hey, Iceberg!

147
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,335
There's someone at the front
gate who wants to see you.

148
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,669
There doesn't
seem to be anyone

149
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,605
on your appointment
schedule for today.

150
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:00,474
It looks like those World
Government Officials again.

151
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,443
Should I tell them
you're unavailable?

152
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:06,080
Mmwell, yes please.
Say I'm gone.

153
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,617
By the way, Lulu. You've got
quite a case of bed-head.

154
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,120
Oops! How embarrassing!
My apologies.

155
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,355
Anyway, I'll ask them to leave.

156
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,190
Uh, thanks! I appreciate it!

157
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,425
[CORGY] Hold it
right there, Iceberg!

158
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,363
[CORGY] Looks like
you're here after all!

159
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,667
Hey! You two need to hide!

160
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,269
Government Officials are here!

161
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,370
What? Uh, okay.

162
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,611
Mmwell, hello again, Corgy!

163
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,280
As you can see,
I'm not here today.

164
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,781
[CORGY] Yes, you are!

165
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,151
Come now! I've come all the
way out here by Sea Train.

166
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:49,223
Don't turn me away.
It's impolite!

167
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,291
[sniffs]

168
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,065
For some reason,
I detect the scent of pirates.

169
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,035
Whatever, in any case,
I want to talk to you.

170
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,704
I don't like you! Go away!

171
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,738
Are you a child?

172
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,773
Nuh-uh. I'm totally an adult.

173
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,245
Then start acting like one.

174
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,580
There's something of
special importance

175
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,315
I need to discuss with you.

176
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:17,050
I would appreciate it
if you would hear me out.

177
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:23,390
Come, let's talk
this over in private.

178
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,060
Those Government guys
are so damn persistent.

179
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,495
What the hell do they
want with Iceberg, anyway?

180
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,664
Look, it has
nothing to do with us.

181
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,633
Probably political
stuff. Coo coo!

182
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,335
[LULU]
Should I beat them up?

183
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:42,476
I wouldn't, I mean they're
Government guys, after all.

184
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,712
What? What's wrong?

185
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,181
Something seemed
weird about these bags

186
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:50,818
when I grabbed them.

187
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,519
They're really light.

188
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,055
Huh?
What do you mean?

189
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,826
Oh, come on!
Stop kidding around!

190
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,395
How could they be with
all of that money inside?

191
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:07,368
[loud screams]

192
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:08,402
Hey. Who's that?

193
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,036
What's with the screaming?

194
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,807
Idiots! What
the hell are you--

195
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,644
Hey, lady! If you sit like
that, everyone can see your--

196
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,382
[NAMI]
Don't tell me. There's no way!

197
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:26,386
[LUFFY]
I don't wanna look!

198
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,124
200 million!!

199
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,426
Gone! It's really gone!

200
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,828
Wait! Look at these bags!
They're not even ours!

201
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,662
[LUFFY and NAMI scream]

202
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,529
[LUFFY]
Wh-Wh-What are we gonna do?

203
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:41,135
Hey, hey! Keep it down!
What's wrong?

204
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,704
Our money. Our money's gone!

205
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,540
Vanished! Gone! Disappeared!

206
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,508
[PAULIE]
What?!

207
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,709
Paulie! Was it you again?!

208
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:49,643
Huh? No!

209
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:50,611
Honest?

210
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,046
[PAULIE]
Why would I lie?

211
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,347
[HATTORI]
You mean it?

212
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,782
They're so noisy.

213
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,517
Hey Kaku, question for ya?

214
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,119
Why were you hanging out with
the Franky Family earlier?

215
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,421
What are you talking about?

216
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,189
I haven't been anywhere
near a single member

217
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,258
of the Franky Family all day.

218
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,093
That's strange. Huh.

219
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,829
I was so certain that
I saw your long nose.

220
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,298
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on a sec!

221
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,633
That's Usopp!

222
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,035
You saw him with
the Franky Family?!

223
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,670
Well, you could
say he was with them.

224
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,206
Or maybe you could say
he was being dragged away.

225
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,743
That's called kidnapping!
Luffy! We gotta find him!

226
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,278
[LUFFY]
Right!

227
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,581
[NAMI] Hey! Hold on!
Where are you going to look?

228
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:33,254
Wait for me, Usopp!
Wait for me, money!

229
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,288
I'm coming!

230
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,394
Hey! Where can I find the
Franky Family's hideout?

231
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,631
It's not really a hideout.
It's more like a workshop.

232
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,832
From where your ship is docked,

233
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,534
it's way up the seashore
to the northeast.

234
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,504
It's off by itself.
You can't miss it.

235
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,473
It's called the Franky House.

236
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:19,233
[NAMI] Luffy! Luffy!
What was he thinking?

237
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,501
There's no way he
could find Usopp

238
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,170
in this place all by himself.

239
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,339
I can't keep looking
for him right now.

240
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,306
Before I do anything else,

241
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,475
I need to take this
money back to the ship.

242
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,678
If I march in there demanding
our 200 million back

243
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,212
while holding 100 million,

244
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,582
I'd be asking them to
steal that money, too.

245
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:37,251
Yagara, please take
me to the bull shop!

246
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,052
Shortest route possible!

247
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,495
I'll take Zoro and the others
with me and teach them a lesson!

248
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,097
Stealing from pirates?

249
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,400
Franky Family, that makes
you the lowest of the low!

250
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:02,109
[ELEVATOR GIRL A] First Floor:
Backstreet Shopping District.

251
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,111
Please proceed with caution.

252
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,213
Thank you and
have a wonderful day.

253
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:14,221
Hurry! I'm counting on you!

254
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:16,156
What's her problem?

255
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,459
Hey! Watch where you're going!

256
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,026
I'm sorry, Sir!

257
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,731
[thinking] I hope Usopp was
able to escape from them...

258
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,632
...somehow...

259
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,680
[CITIZEN AA]
This is terrible!

260
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,282
[CITIZEN II]
Where's this guy from?

261
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,784
[CITIZEN U] Hey! Does
anybody know him? Who is he?

262
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,819
What's with them? Yagara, wait!

263
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,154
Hold on a second! Stop! Stop!

264
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,495
[NAMI]
Usopp!

265
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,499
Usopp!

266
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,434
Hey! Say something!

267
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,437
Are you all right?
Open your eyes! Usopp!

268
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey! Usopp! Wake up!

269
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,076
Excuse me. But are you
two pirates by any chance?

270
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:13,347
Shut up! Stop staring
and mind your own business!

271
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,083
Oh, no. Usopp,
who did this to you?

272
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,084
Was it the Franky Family?

273
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:26,093
It was. It happened
because I'm weak.

274
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,063
They took... They took
all of the money.

275
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,766
[USOPP]
Nami...

276
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,369
Huh?

277
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:40,507
How can I face the others now?

278
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:48,181
We were finally
able to fix the Merry.

279
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,188
I'm so ashamed.

280
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:00,694
Dammit!

281
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,664
Usopp, I understand.

282
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,299
Don't worry about the money.

283
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:08,235
We'll get it back together.

284
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,803
[thinking] He's been
beaten pretty badly.

285
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,771
I probably shouldn't move him.

286
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,809
[NAMI]
Look. Stay right here, okay?

287
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,177
I'm gonna go back to the ship

288
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,179
to get the others
to come and help.

289
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,182
Chopper will have you fixed
up good as new in no time.

290
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,618
And listen, don't worry about
the stolen money, all right?

291
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,753
From what I've heard,
their hideout

292
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,554
isn't too far away from here.

293
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:32,126
We'll crush them and that'll
be the end of it. Okay?

294
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,096
Hey! You think this is
some kind of show? Get lost!

295
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,800
Stay put, okay? I'm going
to you some get help.

296
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,368
I'll be right back!

297
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,009
Hurry, Yagara! Go faster!

298
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,081
[OLD GUY A]
A runaway bull!

299
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:03,490
We were finally
able to fix the Merry.

300
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,225
No matter how much you pay.

301
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,495
That ship can't be restored
to how she used to be.

302
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:13,100
[thinking] Whether we decide
to give in and buy a new ship

303
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,737
or we have someone else manage
to fix and improve the Merry.

304
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,174
If we don't put the entire
300 million into this,

305
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,645
our future journeys together
will be difficult, for sure.

306
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,114
We need that money.
All of it!

307
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,249
We have to get it back!

308
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,654
What? Is that true?

309
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,423
[ZORO] Well, that's
what the shipwright said.

310
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,827
This ship.

311
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,596
It can't be fixed?
Even if we have money?

312
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,833
Then... Then what's going
to happen to the Merry?

313
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,867
Beats me.

314
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,270
Honestly, it really
just depends on how Luffy

315
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:52,539
and the others react after
hearing the assessment.

316
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,608
Either way, I'm sure
they'll get it sorted out

317
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,044
while they're
at the shipyard.

318
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,114
It just seems so extreme!
I mean, look at her!

319
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,316
Same old Merry that
she's always been.

320
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,817
We've traveled
together on this ship

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,122
all the way from the East Blue
to this place! Why now?

322
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,524
You just answered
your own question.

323
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,295
Human beings become stronger
hardship after hardship.

324
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:18,131
But ships are different.
Their wounds just pile up.

325
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,404
[SANJI]
It's so hard to accept.

326
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:28,475
And what is Usopp gonna say
when he hears about all of this?

327
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:31,145
[CHOPPER] I don't wanna
leave her! I love the Merry!

328
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:34,148
I know, we all do.
But her wounds are too deep.

329
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,818
There's nothing we can do.

330
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,589
[SANJI] The Merry's in trouble
and Robin's still missing.

331
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,359
I'm worried about both of them.

332
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,394
[NAMI]
Hey! Everyone!

333
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,732
Look! It's Nami,
and she's alone.

334
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:53,734
[SANJI] Hmm?
That's weird.

335
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,503
I wonder what happened
to Luffy and Usopp.

336
00:18:56,536 --> 00:19:00,340
Hi, Nami!
Is everything all right?

337
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:08,749
[FRANKY]
Ow! Ow! Ow! 200 million?!

338
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:10,818
[FRANKY FAMILY]
Yes! 200 million!

339
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,821
What do you think, bro?
Awesome, right?

340
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:17,057
[FRANKY] Incredible!
You guys are amazing!

341
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,526
Now that we have
this much money

342
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,696
we'll be able to get
what we've always wanted!

343
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,431
We actually did it, didn't we?

344
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:25,633
After three years,

345
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,202
our perseverance
has finally paid off!

346
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,603
I'm stoked!

347
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,437
[FRANKY]
Me, too!

348
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,172
Every time we'd
have a little money

349
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,408
we'd bet it all
on the Yagara races.

350
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,410
And lose every time!

351
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,379
Each time we'd collect
a criminal's bounty,

352
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,713
we'd party and drink!

353
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,448
And spend it all!

354
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,716
We could never ever save up

355
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,485
the 200 million
berries that we needed.

356
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:48,555
Until now! We finally
have enough to get it done!

357
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,392
[FRANKY] And then some.
You guys did a hell of a job!

358
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,260
[cheers]

359
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,763
[FRANKY] Now then.
I know it isn't much,

360
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,533
but here's 5 million berries
to show you how grateful I am.

361
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:04,605
Eat, drink, and have a blast!

362
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,374
Hahaha! That's our bro!

363
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,409
Party time!

What the hell?!

365
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,421
Huh?

366
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,789
What was that?!

367
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:22,856
Show yourself!

368
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:32,399
What fool would dare to
oppose the Franky Family?!

369
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,569
Huh? It's that weakling
we ran into earlier!

370
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:38,071
How did you manage
to even stand up?

371
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,310
Give us our money back!

372
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,180
[FRANKY] "Give us our
money back," you say?

373
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:50,451
Hmm, does that mean
you're one of the Straw Hats?

374
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,453
That's right, bro!
He totally is!

375
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:54,588
I was expecting all
of the Straw Hat crew

376
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,657
to be really strong,
but this one's not at all!

377
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,125
Hahahaha!

378
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,561
Yeah, he's a complete
weakling! What a joke!

379
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,796
Mind your own damn business!

380
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,633

What's he doing?

383
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,073
[FRANKY]
You've got some guts trying

384
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:16,176
to take back the
money all by yourself.

385
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,578
But I'm afraid
I can't let you have it.

386
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:28,155
Give it back!

387
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,557
We need the money...

388
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,067
...to fix the Merry!

389
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,039
Her scars are deep.

390
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,607
That's our money.

391
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,577
It's to heal her wounds,
understand me?!

392
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,146
You can't have it!

393
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,348
Give it back to me right now!

[CHOPPER]
He's hurt pretty badly,

400
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,303
but I know he's
gonna be all right.

401
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,371
I'll find a way
to save him somehow!

402

[LUFFY] Right. Hang in there,
Usopp! Don't worry.

"Rescuing Our Friend!
Raid on the Franky House."
