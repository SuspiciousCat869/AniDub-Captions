00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,595
Hold on. If they
bring it here now,

177
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,139
it defeats the purpose
in having emergency food!

178
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,765
Even if you starve,
it's fine.

179
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,476
Come now, Cindry.
That's hurtful!

[MORIA] Gyoro! Nin! Bao!

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,188
Go to Hogback's mansion,
retrieve the provisions,

182
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,565
and bring them here!

183

Or the humming guy!
They're bad news!

to the Spider Monkey

you can't be too careful!

Did you see them?

00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,750
[NIN] I thought I dropped
it somewhere, but look!

191
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,793
I found the store room key!

Sal-Salted?!

We can't let that

If it does, the Master

Come on!

No doubt about it!

Why are you getting in

That scared me.

Even so, it's dangerous
for me when the sun is up,

Wait! A song!
When you're scared,

305
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,231
you should sing something
to take your mind off things!

00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,357
Now if I run really fast

307
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,485
so I can't see their scary
faces and purify each one,

00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,218
[RYUMA] Give up.

347
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,095
No matter how many times
you try to defeat me,

348
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,181
the outcome will
always be the same.

349
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,474
But I think I know
what's slowing you down.

350
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,728
Why don't you let me cut off
that bothersome afro of yours?

351
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,148
What? No! Stop it!
Anything but that!

352
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,816
Don't you dare
even touch this afro!

353
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,151
You hear me?

354
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,110
Don't you understand?

355
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,196
If you're my shadow,
then you have to know

356
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,448
how truly important
this afro is to me!

357
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,200
Because of the fact
that my body has stopped

358
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,493
growing my afro
would never grow back!

359
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,370
It would be gone forever!

360
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,540
Nyohohoho!
So? Who cares?

361
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,292
And though I am your shadow,

362
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,587
I've forgotten everything about
the days we spent together.

363
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,840
As of now, Moria and
Absalom are my masters!

364
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,717
They give the orders, not you!

365
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,223
[RYUMA] A walking skeleton
that treasures his afro?

366
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,351
Do you realize how
ridiculous you are? Pathetic!

367
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,311
[BROOK] Stop it, please!

368
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,773
Not the afro! No! Don't!
Anything but the afro!

369
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,378
[RYUMA]
Nyohohoho!

370
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,348
Yohohohoho!

371
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,769
What a foolish trick!

372
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,813
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

373
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,939
You say whatever you like.

374
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,317
There's a reason why
I can't lose, why I must fight!

375
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,283
Nyohohoho!

376
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,618
Ahh!

377
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,708
[RYUMA] How pathetic
you are, my former master.

378
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,670
It seems that I have lost,
I accept defeat.

379
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,632
[BROOK] Yet, I beg of you.
Please. Let me live.

380
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,926
I'll leave this
island immediately.

381
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,720
[RYUMA] Go. Get out of my sight!

382
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,597
[RYUMA] If you were to die,

383
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,641
it'd be a problem
for me, as well.

384
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,196
[RYUMA] I've never
seen such a pitiful scene.

385
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,615
[BROOK] I don't
care what you say.

386
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,329
Arrrgh!

387
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,920
Nyhohohoho!

388
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,214
[BROOK] During
these past 5 years,

389
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,676
I've been thinking of nothing
but this second chance.

390
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,180
And I've trained
to become stronger!

391
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,615
Huh? Oh!

392
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,784
Good evening, Master Absalom!

393
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,452
[ABSALOM]
Have you gotten everything

394
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,245
in order for the ceremony?

395
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,705
[ZOMBIE WEDDING PLANNER]
Ah, yes!

396
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,874
Everything's ready
whenever you are.

397
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,921
My, my! What a beautiful bride!

398
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,714
Then start at once!

399
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,842
Put her in a dress and
bring her to the wedding hall.

400
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,430
Of course!

401
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,898
[USOPP] I see!

402
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,317
So that skeleton gave us
a lot of useful information!

403
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,985
[FRANKY] Yeah,
I really misjudged him.

404
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,946
Even though his whole
crew got wiped out,

405
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,739
he's stayed alive
these past 50 years

406
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,574
to keep a promise to a friend.

407
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,326
To a whale that's been waiting

408
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,578
for him all this time
at a cape far away.

409
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,329
[USOPP] A whale?

410
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,289
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

411
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,250
"A Man's Promise Never Dies!

412
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,752
To the Friend Waiting
Under the Distant Sky!"

413
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,422
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
