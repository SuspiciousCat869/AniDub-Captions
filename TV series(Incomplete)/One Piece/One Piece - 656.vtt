WEBVTT

00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.939
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:37.882
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.855
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:46.065
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.877
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.814
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.258
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:03.601
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.370
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.219
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.298
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:22.605
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.444
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:29.018
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.922
When Luffy hears about
a fighting tournament

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:32.291
at the Corrida Colosseum

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.629
with the Flame Flame Fruit
as the prize,

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:37.903
he decides to join and compete
against titanic contenders

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:40.641
from all over the New World.

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:43.246
[SANJI]
Premiere Hachis Hash!

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.987
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:50.427
Pentachromatic Strings!

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.395
[SANJI grunts]

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.366
Overheat!

00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:59.044
[LAW]
Room!

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:00.781
Law... Dammit!

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.285
[LAW]
Listen up.

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:05.290
Here's the plan.
I want you to head to Zou,

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:06.893
and take him.

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.801
[CHOPPER] There's a Navy
battleship flying right over us!

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.373
[BROOK] Doflamingo's closing in
from the other side!

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.076
[CHOPPER screams]

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:19.117
[NAMI]
Are those meteors?!

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.521
[LAW]
Room!

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.692
Hold up, Law.

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:24.428
I realize it's important
to get Caesar

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.666
as far away from
here as possible,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.639
and it's pretty obvious
we have to leave now.

00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:31.342
But the operation in Dressrosa

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.614
was just supposed
to be a waypoint.

00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:35.685
I thought our shared goal
was taking down

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:38.023
Kaido of the Four Emperors.

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:39.491
I wonder...

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.897
Why are you getting so
hung up on Doflamingo?

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.565
[LAW grunts]

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.071
Coup De Burst! Fire!

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:51.148
[LAW] At any rate, my pirate
alliance with the Straw Hat crew

00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:54.088
is coming to its
natural conclusion.

00:04:54.122 --> 00:04:55.090
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

00:04:55.123 --> 00:04:57.427
Do I have to
spell it out for ya?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.298
From the moment we teamed up,

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.171
my only goal was shutting
down the SMILE factory.

00:05:02.204 --> 00:05:03.574
I was using them.

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:06.012
While killing you today
would bring me pleasure,

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:07.716
it doesn't matter.

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.453
Since Kaido will do it
sooner or later.

00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:13.193
After you end up
losing the SMILEs.

00:05:13.226 --> 00:05:15.664
How noble of you.

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:19.105
Sacrificing your
life to stop me.

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:20.775
[LAW]
While I'd love to see what chaos

00:05:20.808 --> 00:05:23.213
the world falls into
once you're dead...

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:26.118
First and foremost,
I want to make you pay

00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:30.227
for what you did 13 years ago...

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.130
Joker!

00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:58.049
Make me pay?

00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:01.422
For what happened
to you 13 years ago?

00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:04.395
[LAW]
Yeah, you heard me.

00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:06.165
[DOFLAMINGO]
Come on, Law.

00:06:06.198 --> 00:06:10.173
Holding Giolla hostage won't
get you anywhere with me.

00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.476
He's got a point!

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.350
I'll gladly give my life for
the sake of the Young Master--

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:18.490
[gasps]

00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.493
[LAW]
Then I'd advise you to run away.

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:22.364
You fool, do you honestly

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:23.801
believe I'd be so
artless as to abando--

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.103
[DOFLAMINGO]
I don't need you.

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:26.238
[gasps]

00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:29.846
[DOFLAMINGO]
Go. Run as far as you can.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.985
[GIOLLA whimpers]
Yes, sir!

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:42.137
Things got messy back
on Straw Hat's ship.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.913
I admit, my plan isn't going
quite as smoothly as I'd hoped.

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:50.588
You're right.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.860
That's not all, you lost
your leverage altogether.

00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:58.403
[LAW] Whether you beat me
or not, with Caesar gone,

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:01.910
you no longer have a hold
on the SMILE factory.

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:03.045
Oh?

00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:07.187
[LAW]
Face it, you screwed up.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.857
It's all over.

00:07:09.893 --> 00:07:11.663
My, you are still mad.

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:15.269
Grudges aren't healthy.
I'd let it go.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:18.744
This isn't just a grudge.

00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:25.991
I've lived my whole life
to achieve this goal.

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:29.532
I'll see his dream
through to the end!

00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:42.625
[chuckles]

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:51.141
[LAW grunts]

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.688
[LAW yells]

00:07:57.722 --> 00:07:59.358
[DOFLAMINGO yelling]

00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:14.388
That was close.

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:17.193
Doflamingo almost caught up
to the Sunny back there.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.364
I sure hope Traffy's okay.

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.571
Pay attention, you guys!
See anything out there?

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:25.911
Brook reporting here!
At a 45-degree angle.

00:08:25.944 --> 00:08:27.648
Everything looks just lovely!

00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:29.986
You have to watch all
the angles, you bonehead!

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:31.422
Sure thing, Nami.

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:34.027
Three-hundred
and sixty-degrees it is!

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.702
[BROOK laughing]

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:39.271
[sighs]

00:08:41.108 --> 00:08:44.716
[NAMI]
The sky's gotten pretty cloudy.

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:46.720
I can't relax
knowing that creep

00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:49.692
could swoop down on his
strings at any second.

00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:50.828
Listen, Brook!

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.999
Keep an eye out for anything
weird up in the sky.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.072
Oh, I'm more than happy to
keep both eyes out for you.

00:08:56.105 --> 00:08:58.543
Why, they've been out for years!

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:01.415
[laughing]

00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:05.591
If he comes near us again,

00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:08.162
then I'll use my weapon to
blow away all the clouds!

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:10.166
He won't be able to follow us.

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:14.509
[BROOK] That's our genius
navigator for you! Ouch.

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:17.214
[NAMI] But still,
should we really go ahead

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:20.086
to Zou like Law told us?

00:09:20.119 --> 00:09:23.492
I mean, in the moment, we needed
to get away from Doflamingo

00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:26.499
and the Navy, but this
is kind of a big move.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.203
[SANJI] You better
protect my sweet Robin,

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:31.442
even if it costs you
your lives, you got that?

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:32.512
Click.

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:33.514
[CHOPPER]
What's up?

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.450
I was making sure
that Robin's still safe.

00:09:35.484 --> 00:09:37.621
She's with Franky
and Usopp right now.

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:40.193
Okay, so if Zoro and Kin'emon
meet up with Luffy,

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:42.030
we should be fine!

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:46.171
Well, Mosshead's probably
too bad with directions

00:09:46.205 --> 00:09:49.512
to find his way to
the Colosseum alone.

00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:53.219
But Kin'emon's with him,
so they'll make it.

00:09:53.252 --> 00:09:56.526
I'm awful worried
about Traffy, though.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.095
Eh, he's a big boy.

00:09:58.128 --> 00:10:00.568
Seems he's planning to
let Kaido kill Doflamingo

00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:02.371
instead of offing
the guy himself.

00:10:02.404 --> 00:10:05.209
So he just has to focus
on escaping now.

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:06.145
[CHOPPER]
Yeah...

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:07.548
Yeah.

00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.021
[MOMONOSUKE whimpering]

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:13.693
[SANJI] Hey, why'd you
turn back into a dragon?

00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:17.267
I... I just can't stop thinking
about what happened.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.302
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:20.541
[MOMONOSUKE]
That flying man.

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:22.444
[SANJI]
Doflamingo?

00:10:22.478 --> 00:10:23.713
[MOMONOSUKE]
Yes.

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:27.320
I remember seeing him the last
time I came to Dressrosa.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:28.790
[SANJI]
Really?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.836
[DONQUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Master, you're gonna kill him!

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:37.675
[DOFLAMINGO] What the hell's
the matter with you?

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:40.614
[muffled groaning]

00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:43.319
You're supposed to be
a gladiator, right?

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:46.492
Then act like it!

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:49.766
[gasping]

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.703
A gladiator should
fight for his life,

00:10:51.736 --> 00:10:54.441
not run around like a chicken
with its head cut off!

00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:57.080
So... If you can't bring
yourself to kill anyone,

00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.386
the least you can do is let
somebody cut you to pieces!

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.990
Don't act like you don't know.

00:11:02.023 --> 00:11:03.827
All humans are the same.

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.199
Everyone gets riled up
over a little bloodshed

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:07.401
and that's why they're here!

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:08.504
[MOMONOSUKE whimpers]

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:09.940
[DOFLAMINGO]
Sorry.

00:11:09.973 --> 00:11:13.881
That's just entertainment!
Now, entertain!

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:14.649
[COMPETITOR I groaning]

00:11:14.682 --> 00:11:15.951
[gasps]

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:23.800
[whimpers]

00:11:25.538 --> 00:11:27.742
[KIN'EMON]
Shh...

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:29.812
Piece of garbage.

00:11:34.355 --> 00:11:37.193
Better not see anyone
else cutting corners.

00:11:37.226 --> 00:11:39.197
[DONQUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Y-Yes sir!

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:42.972
[KANJURO]
Kin'emon! There you are!

00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.942
Ah. It's Kanjuro!

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.211
[KANJURO]
I found a harbor.

00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:48.183
We have to steal
a ship and escape,

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:50.220
this land is too dangerous.

00:11:50.253 --> 00:11:51.088
[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:11:51.122 --> 00:11:54.428
[panting]

00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:56.231
I just realized
that foul monster

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:58.804
is holding Kanjuro
captive as we speak.

00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:03.379
And now I simply
cannot stop worrying.

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:06.084
Please be safe, Kanjuro!

00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:09.559
[MOMONOSUKE sighs]

00:12:09.592 --> 00:12:11.395
[gasps, screams]

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:12.865
Why do you look so happy?!

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.804
Don't worry, being taken
hostage is no big deal.

00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:17.106
Whatever they wanted out of him,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.848
I'm sure they won't torture
him too bad. He'll be okay.

00:12:20.882 --> 00:12:22.852
[MOMONOSUKE] You're obviously
thinking about something else!

00:12:22.886 --> 00:12:24.789
At least pretend to care!

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:29.331
That reminds me, Violet said
she'd be okay, too. Yeah.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.640
I'll be fine.
I talked to my friend,

00:12:33.673 --> 00:12:36.846
and I'm certain the
Government will protect me.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.182
[SANJI]
Really?

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:42.625
[VIOLET] Yes. They're probably
waiting for me at the harbor.

00:12:42.658 --> 00:12:44.762
Just trust me.

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:46.900
All right. I'd feel
better if I could

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.574
go along with you,
but as long as you're safe.

00:12:50.607 --> 00:12:51.375
[SANJI gasping]

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:52.545
You've done enough.

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.749
I can do this
thanks to all your help.

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:57.153
How can I ever
show my gratitude?

00:12:57.187 --> 00:12:58.623
Well, we could start

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:00.828
with a little kiss on
the cheek, and then maybe--

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.397
[SANJI groaning]

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.134
[gasps] Oh, no!

00:13:04.168 --> 00:13:07.241
It would seem your ship is
under attack by Fighting Fish!

00:13:07.274 --> 00:13:09.178
Uh-oh. What are those?

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:11.816
No time, just go!

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.822
[SANJI]
Nami!

00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:32.390
[CROWD cheers]

00:13:32.423 --> 00:13:33.593
[VIOLET gasps]

00:13:35.363 --> 00:13:37.334
Damn it! She's still alive!

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:38.837
How'd she get this far?

00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:41.642
Why don't you drop dead,
Rebecca?

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:50.426
Mr. Horse?

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.295
[TOY HORSE]
Yes?

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.232
Take me to the palace, quickly.

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:57.006
[TOY HORSE]
You got it!

00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:20.086
[CROWD cheering]

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:30.373
V-V-V-Vice Captain!

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:32.410
Huh? Vice Captain?

00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:34.147
You're not talkin'
to me, are you?

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:37.087
Yeah, you're Mister Zoro,
aren't you?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.594
Mister Luffy's right-hand man.
I'd know you anywhere.

00:14:40.627 --> 00:14:41.830
Uh, you would?

00:14:41.863 --> 00:14:44.669
So it appears your disguise
has failed you.

00:14:44.702 --> 00:14:48.008
[ZORO clears throat]
Whoever this Zoro guy is,

00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:49.512
uh, I'm not him!

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:51.750
You don't have to put up
a front with me!

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:53.319
Don't worry, I know everything

00:14:53.353 --> 00:14:55.290
that's been goin'
on with youse guys.

00:14:55.323 --> 00:14:57.528
Mister Luffy fightin'
in the tournament.

00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.930
All that stuff.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.033
[ZORO]
What?!

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.234
[gasps]

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:03.640
[BARTOLOMEO] I-I-I can't
believe I'm talkin' to

00:15:03.673 --> 00:15:06.379
the great Mister Zoro
like it's nothin' at all!

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:10.721
This... This is the
best day of my life!

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.459
[wails]

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:15.697
[KIN'EMON]
What's got you so upset?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.837
[ZORO]
Whatever, weirdo.

00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:23.580
Tell me why you know so
much about me and Luffy!

00:15:23.613 --> 00:15:25.817
[BARTOLOMEO sniffles]

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:29.626
[BARTOLOMEO] I've been your
biggest fan for years!

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:33.967
Ugh, so pathetic.
He can't even answer!

00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.205
[BARTOLOMEO]
G-Get it together, Barto,

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:39.311
you finally get
to meet your hero!

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:41.850
C... Could I...?

00:15:41.883 --> 00:15:42.985
[ZORO]
Huh?

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.055
[ZORO]
Suck it up!

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:46.660
Ah! Right!

00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:48.429
[gasps]

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:51.401
[BARTOLOMEO]
He yelled at me! I'm so honored!

00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:54.975
[BARTOLOMEO]
Could I have your autograph?!

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:56.077
[BARTOLOMEO]
I said it!

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:56.846
[ZORO]
What?

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:58.951
If I bring Mister Luffy to ya,

00:15:58.984 --> 00:16:01.455
then will you give
me your autograph?

00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:03.861
[ZORO]
It'd be a big help if you did!

00:16:03.894 --> 00:16:06.364
[screaming]

00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:09.972
[BARTOLOMEO] He just said
I would be a big help!

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:14.915
I don't believe it!
Me, a big help to Mister Zoro!

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.384
[BARTOLOMEO gasping]

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:24.234
[KIN'EMON]
What is this guy's problem?

00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:26.305
[ZORO]
Well, come on, hop to it!

00:16:26.338 --> 00:16:28.209
O... O... O...

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:29.143
[ZORO
"O-O-O," what?!

00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:32.718
On my way!
Wait right there!

00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:36.058
I'll bring Mister Luffy
back here if it kills me!

00:16:36.092 --> 00:16:37.794
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:42.638
[ZORO]
It's not that serious.

00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:45.510
[BARTOLOMEO panting]
I can't screw this up!

00:16:45.543 --> 00:16:49.451
Mister Zoro said I would be
a big help if I did this!

00:16:49.484 --> 00:16:53.158
He's really depending on me
to save the day, isn't he?

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:55.530
It's almost like...

00:16:55.563 --> 00:16:57.801
I just became
the right-hand man

00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:00.941
of Mister Luffy's
right-hand man!

00:17:00.974 --> 00:17:04.480
This is great!
No, greater than great!

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:09.692
You can count on me!
I won't let you down, I promise!

00:17:10.593 --> 00:17:13.065
[CROWD cheering]

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.438
[GYATS] The battle royale
still rages on!

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:19.244
And Block D is a fierce bunch!

00:17:19.278 --> 00:17:21.782
All the combatants are
bringing their A-game!

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:25.724
It's hard to guess
who'll be eliminated next!

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.076
Hey, that big fella is
making quite an impression!

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.514
He's a military captain
from the Southern kingdom

00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:41.556
of Scorchistan! Rolling Logan!

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.763
[LOGAN chuckles]

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:47.467
[COMPETITOR A gasping]

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.041
Let's see. I'll give this a try!

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:55.216
[COMPETITOR A whimpers]

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.724
Okay, then.
Let's get things rollin'!

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:01.595
[COMPETITOR A screaming]

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:07.473
There you have it, folks!

00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:10.179
This is Rolling Logan's
signature technique!

00:18:10.212 --> 00:18:13.520
He calls it the Rolling Cradle!

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:16.224
[LOGAN laughing]

00:18:18.395 --> 00:18:19.364
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:20.567
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.072
[GYATS] He rolls his opponent
around the ring so fast,

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.610
it destroys their equilibrium!

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:27.914
And for the big finale...

00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:30.554
[COMPETITOR A groaning]

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:32.958
[GYATS]
The Leg Split!

00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:36.899
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:36.932 --> 00:18:39.404
[LOGAN laughing]

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:42.811
That one was a big hit
with the crowd, I see!

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:46.284
Oh, wait! What do we
have right here?

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:54.000
[yelling]

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:58.844
[COMPETITOR D screams]

00:18:58.877 --> 00:19:00.479
[GYATS]
The spectacle of Rolling Logan

00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:04.487
distracted us from this
quiet confrontation!

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:08.161
[CROWD booing]

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:12.070
They say ill weeds grow in
every garden, and this is ours!

00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:16.111
It's the cursed
princess Rebecca!

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:19.283
I've never heard booing
this loud before!

00:19:19.317 --> 00:19:21.822
[panting]

00:19:29.304 --> 00:19:32.711
[booing continues]

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.125

--[TOY SOLDIER grunting]

00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:52.818
A human's power is limitless.
You must dig deeper!

00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:55.957
Draw out all of your strength!

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:57.762
[REBECCA cries]

00:19:57.795 --> 00:20:01.067
Get up. On your feet.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.107
I don't want to!

00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:08.448
Please, Soldier, I don't
want to hurt anybody!

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:12.156
[TOY SOLDIER] You must grow
stronger to survive, child.

00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:15.362
I know it's hard, but you must!

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:22.343
[REBECCA, TOY SOLDIER grunting]

[COMPETITOR E yelling]

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.500

Ahh!

[COMPETITOR E groans]

00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:46.525

[COMPETITOR E yelps]

00:20:48.897 --> 00:20:52.203
She just won't quit!
That's her favorite move!

00:20:52.237 --> 00:20:55.075
It's come to be known as
the Back-to-the-Water Dance!

00:20:55.109 --> 00:20:58.048
[panting]

00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:01.221
[TOY SOLDIER] You must grow
stronger to survive, child.

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:03.826
[GYATS] Taking advantage
of her enemies' momentum,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.930
she lures them to
the edge of the ring

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.837
and stands with her
back to the water.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.075
Finally, she dodges
her opponents' advances

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.377
with lightning speed,

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.316
causing them to barrel
right into the moat!

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:16.085
[gasps]

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:18.523

[COMPETITOR F groans]

00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:29.110
[GYATS]
That's it!

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:33.085
The famous
Back-to-the-Water Dance!

00:21:33.118 --> 00:21:35.022
Yes! Because of that technique,

00:21:35.056 --> 00:21:37.193
despite fighting in
countless battles,

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:40.901
Rebecca has never
once wounded anybody!

00:21:40.934 --> 00:21:43.740
[LUFFY] She uses
Observation Haki? Sweet!

00:21:43.774 --> 00:21:45.008
[INMATE A]
Haki?

00:21:45.042 --> 00:21:47.648
[GYATS] Rebecca's also never
been wounded during a match!

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.585
So far, she's won every fight

00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:52.157
just by letting her foes
fall off the side!

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.127
[cheers]

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.400
What a trooper!
Good job, Rebecca!

00:21:57.433 --> 00:21:59.270
A remarkable fighting style!

00:21:59.304 --> 00:22:02.912
Even if she's hardly
"fighting" at all!

00:22:02.945 --> 00:22:04.948
I must grudgingly admit,

00:22:04.982 --> 00:22:08.255
there's something
beautiful about it!

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:10.025
Oh?

00:22:17.006 --> 00:22:18.475
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.816
[GYATS] Still, it may find its
match in this competition!

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.154
The other warriors have
their own unique ways

00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:26.324
of eliminating their opponents!

00:22:26.357 --> 00:22:29.063
They are world-class gladiators!

00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:30.900
[LOGAN]
Huh?

00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:39.585
[LOGAN laughs]

00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:43.959
Lucky me!
Now I get to pulverize you.

00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:47.199
Let's get this going,
Little Weed.

00:22:49.939 --> 00:22:54.180
[laughing]

00:23:14.888 --> 00:23:17.493
[NARRATOR] As Rebecca
desperately brandishes her sword

00:23:17.527 --> 00:23:19.464
to secure the
Flame Flame Fruit,

00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:21.434
she is forced into a
confrontation against

00:23:21.468 --> 00:23:23.806
the cruel military commander,
Rolling Logan.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.213
Thus begins the showdown between
her beautiful battle dance

00:23:27.246 --> 00:23:29.851
and Logan's powerful
pulverizing technique!

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:31.522
