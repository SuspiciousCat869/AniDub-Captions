[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo.

179
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,000
[ZORO] I should just
crawl around on the ground

180
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,753
like a worm, and eat dirt!

181
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,006
[scoffs]

182
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,133
Where am I
and why are you here?

183
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,843
I could ask you the same thing!

184
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,428
Also, don't scream like that!

185
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,097
[grunts]

186
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,433
What did you do with my swords?

187
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,437
[PERONA] Oh, you won't
be getting those back.

188
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,023
[grunts] I'm warning you.

189

[scoffs]

191
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,529
This ought to slow you down.

[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo.

194
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,955
[ZORO] I'm nothing but garbage.

195
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,416
Someone should throw me away.

196
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,382
Aaah.

197
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,384
[PERONA]
Ha! You're not so tough!

198
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,428
Or rather,
I'm just super awesome!

199
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,182
Heh!

200
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,227
[ZORO growls] How dare you!

201
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,104
Don't you growl at me like that!

202
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,480
It's not cute at all!

203
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,941
From now on,
you're going to be my servant.

204
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,192
Understand me?

205
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,944
[ZORO growls]

206
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,571
Now no more talking--
just be cute.

207
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,325
What the hell?
Stop that! This is not okay!

208
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,536
[ZORO]
No touching! No touching!

209
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,871
I won't be lonely ever again.

210
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,916
Crap! I can't even move!

211
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,167

[PERONA] Oh, Kumacy!

217
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:05,015

you do to me? Get off!

I'm sorry I yelled at you.

221
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,190
Lesson learned.
You're forgiven.

223
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:18,195
[ZORO] You little--! I do
apologize--wait! Screw you!

224
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,574
I'll call you Mistress--
oh, like hell I will!

225
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,952
[ZORO] Okay, seriously.
Really sorry, here.

[laughs]

227
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,874
All right, I get it!
That's enough!

228
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,626
[ZORO] Ugh! Wasted too much
time here already!

229
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,003
I've gotta go back.

230
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,379
[PERONA]
Hey dummy, exit's that way.

231
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,923
[ZORO] Huh? Oh, gotcha.

232
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,927
[gasps] No, wait,
I shouldn't have told him that!

233
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,053
Where are you going?

234
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,222
You're not even walking
in the direction I pointed!

[PERONA] Hey!

238
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,234
Yeah, what is it?

239
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,237
Unless you tell me where
you hid my swords, I don't care.

240
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,614
Mmm...

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,040
Are you leaving now, or what?

243
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,417
It's none of your
damn business. Piss off.

00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,194
You won't get away
from me that easily.

247
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,987
Uh...

248
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,282
Because y'see, I've been
lonely far too long.

We call upon you,
our great lord!

We pray to you, Oh Powerful One,

255
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,643
to rain terror
on our hateful enemies.

name that we make this wish!

dreadful looking creature!

No kidding.

271
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,283
It's not of this world.

Please grant us our wish!

280
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,884
[SATANIC PRIEST] In exchange,
we are prepared

281

to offer our souls up to you!

What is this place?

00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:13,198
How far have I been carried away
from all of my dear friends?

289
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,496
More importantly, what in
the world has happened to them?

[SATAN WORSHIPPERS gasp]

291

Whatever their plight,
I must aid them!

I'll return to

Hell yet, Master Satan!

Quickly men,
we've got to stop him!

296
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,428
[SATAN WORSHIPPER 421G]
We need to offer him more!

297
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,722
But what could we possibly
offer Master Satan?

298
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,224
A sacrifice? Some blood?

299
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,559
[SATAN WORSHIPPER 421G]
What should we do?

300
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,769
I'll give up anything!

301
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,771

[BROOK] Pardon me.

309
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,850
Would you be so kind
as to show me your panties?

[SATANIC BLONDE GIRL gasps]

311
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,729
[SATANIC PRIEST] He...
he wants to see underwear!

312
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,357
Everyone show him
your underwear!

313
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,366
[BROOK] Uhm. I-I don't need to
see any man panties, thank you.

314
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,910
I--oh, uh--wow...!

00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,787
[NARRATOR] And now
we return to the present,

speeding over the waves

317
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,794
to the Great Prison, Impel Down,
to rescue his brother Ace.

you're a stowaway--

[MARINE 421A] Excuse me?

326
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,859
Is someone else
in your room with you?

Oh, damn it.

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,863
Lieutenant Stalker,
are you certain about this?

329
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,323
Yes, sir!
I just heard someone say,

330
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,367
"Whew! I couldn't
eat another bite!"

331
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,537
And I hardly think that the
Empress would say that, do you?

332
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,497
Hmmm...

333
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,708
He's right.
She'd never say that

334
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,377
and if she did,
I'll give myself a mohawk!

There, I'm finished for now.
Take these plates away.

Oh yes, and don't forget,

342
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,317
[HANCOCK] I require the same
amount five times every day.

how are we supposed to eat?

00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,926
tensions at Navy
Headquarters are rising.

352
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,094
Famous marines
from all over the world

353
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,430
are gathering at
the harbor of Marineford,

354
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,725
prepared to battle
to the death, if need be.

355
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,743
[NARRATOR]
In the name of justice,

356
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,121
they ready their swords,
not for any mere battle,

357
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,998
but for war.

358
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,968
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the Holy Land of Marie Jois.

359
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,470
[MARINES gulp]

360
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,972
[NARRATOR]
The Seven Warlords are summoned

361
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,723
for a meeting
to determine their roles

362
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,101
in the event
that Whitebeard attacks.

363
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,978
Ruffians that they are, however,

364
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,730
they have little taste
for the discussion.

365
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,067
[NARRATOR]
The mood in the room is tense

366
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,986
and all hopes for teamwork,

367
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,405
or any sort of organization,

368
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,824
are quickly put to rest.

369
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,994
[clanging]

370
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:37,629
[ACE breathes heavily]

371
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,633
Old man.

372
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,471
[GARP] Huh.
How can you still be alive

373
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,141
with all of those
horrific wounds?

374
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,019
Huh, Ace?

375
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,026
[GARP] Because of you,
Navy Headquarters is--

376
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,613
No. All of the
World Government is a mess.

377
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,200
[laughs]

378
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,870
Just... kill me.

379
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,413
Hm?

380
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,751
Do it. Kill me, now!

381
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,547
So you wanna die, huh?
You damned fool!

382
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,800
[GARP] Nothing can be done now.
Everything's in motion.

383
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,094
Even if you were
to die right now

384
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,930
that won't stop
Whitebeard from fighting.

385
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,479
There's nothing that can
stop that anymore, son.

386
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,816
Seems the Navy has made
the King of the Sea...

387
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,610
[ACE grunts]

388
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,737
[GARP] mad as hell!

389
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,242
[ACE grunts lightly]

390
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,840
[ACE snivels]

391
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,592
Father!

392
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,103
[NARRATOR] Before he can
reunite with his friends,

393
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,773
Luffy must make an urgent trip
to rescue his brother Ace.

394
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,858
To do so, he must
infiltrate the notoriously

395
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,236
well guarded prison, Impel Down.

396
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,279
But is there any hope
of making it in?

397
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,658
Let alone making it out
with an escaped prisoner.

398
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,243
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece,

399
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,953
A Deadly Infiltration!

400
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,622
The Underwater Prison,
Impel Down!

401
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,833
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
