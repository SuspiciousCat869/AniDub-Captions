00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,710
That's when it all began.

348
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,713
The so called Great Pirate Era
where everyone with a boat

349
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,381
claims to be a pirate.

350
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,817
But look around
this once great town.

351
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,886
I'll bet you won't be able to
find yourself a real pirate.

352
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,557
Nothing here but...
cowards and scum.

353
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,892
Men brave enough to make
the journey to the Grand Line

354
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,528
have all disappeared
from these waters.

355
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,564
There are no more
true pirates left,

356
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,532
that's why I'm closing down.

357
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,835
[LUFFY]
I'm going to the Grand Line.

358
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,902
[RAOUL]
Huh?

359
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,338
Hell yeah. Gold Roger's so cool.

360
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,008
He's exactly how
a pirate's supposed to be.

361
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,444
That's why I'm here.
To go to the Grand Line.

362
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,346
Get my hands on the One Piece.

363
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,282
And then,
be King of the Pirates.

364
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,719
[RAOUL gasps]

365
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,925
[RAOUL]
Those are some pretty big words.

366
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,595
Even more so
cause you're in this bar.

367
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,597
[LUFFY]
I only said what I meant.

368
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,632
[RAOUL laughs]

369
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,802
Young man, if there are still
people like you out there,

370
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,271
should I hold off
on closing this place?

371
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,939
I don't know.
It could just be me.

372
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,376
[RAOUL] That's right.
It could just be you.

373
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,278
In that case,
let's have a drink.

374
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,782
I haven't been in this
good a mood in some time.

375
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,750
Um, I don't drink alcohol.

376
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,088
[laughs] All right.
Then how about this?

377
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,323
Let's raise
our glasses together...

378
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,727
...to the Eternal King
of the Pirates.

379
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,396
[chuckles]

380
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,299
Here's to
the King of the Pirates.

381
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,643
Ugh. So it's you.

382
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,646
[SMOKER] Now, that's no way
to treat a customer.

383
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,614
Especially your only one.

384
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,849
Why don't you cut the crap?

385
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,952
You just want to see me
close this place down.

386
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,421
You don't have a right
to be angry with me.

387
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,624
I didn't turn all the pirates
around here into cowards.

388
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,326
That was a decision
they all made

389
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,029
once they got
to know me, that's all.

390
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,031
Hm?

391
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,502
Well isn't that nice?
So you had a guest.

392
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,004
I think I'd like
a taste of rum, old man.

393
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,140
[RAOUL]
I don't have any for you.

394
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,642
Don't be such a bastard.

395
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,513
Today is a very special day.

396
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,981
Don't you think?

397
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,355
Good stuff.

398
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,994
[SMOKER] I can see it
like it was yesterday.

399
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,330
The day he was executed.

400
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,336
Finally, I found main street.

401
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,039
I wonder if Gold Roger ever
walked down this street like me.

402
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:06,411
[SMOKER]
It was hot, like today. Sticky.

403

[BOY panting]

404
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,349
[SMOKER] They had him
shackled as they led him

405
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,351
down main street
toward the square

406
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,854
where they built
the execution platform.

407
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,925
He walked through town
like it was a victory parade.

408

[BOY panting]

409
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,954
[SMOKER]
Wealth, fame, power...

410
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,455
Gold Roger attained this

411
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,292
and everything else
life had to offer.

412
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,795
He was facing his
final moments before death,

413
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,932
but he acted like
it was his coronation.

414
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,467

Destiny...

who seek freedom in this life,

these things shall not
vanish from the earth!

Do you have any
final words to say?

419
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,992
[GOLD ROGER] Would you
mind taking these off?

420
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,328
They're beginning to chafe me
quite a bit. Please?

421
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,896
I can't do that.

422
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,599
Where am I going to run?

423
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:39,271
That's all right. I guess
I'm on my own for this one.

or someplace else?
