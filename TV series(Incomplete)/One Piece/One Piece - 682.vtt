00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.946
[cackles]

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.088
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.992
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:42.505
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.649
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.555
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:45.798
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.514
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.019
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.857
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.333
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:04.869
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:16.225
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:18.263
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:20.467
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:23.339
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:26.112
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:28.416
After learning of the
Kingdom's dark history,

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.454
Usopp broke the curse
on its people,

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:32.357
revealing the truth to all.

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.495
Doflamingo,
left with no other option,

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.668
confined the island in his
inescapable "Birdcage."

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:41.175
[DOFLAMINGO] Think it over.
Will you attempt to kill me?

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.348
Or will spare yourselves
and join my Family?

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.753
All that I'm asking you
to do is to hold just

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:50.059
12 fools accountable for
rebelling against me.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:51.428
If you make the
wrong choice,

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.401
you'll never get to see
the end result of this game.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.508
The stars will be worth
100 million berries each.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.478
[TOYS]
...100 million Berries?!

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:01.016
[DOFLAMINGO]
The following individuals

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.219
will be your ticket out.

00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:05.056
[ALL gasping]

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.895
Let me introduce
the One-stars.

00:04:18.818 --> 00:04:22.290
[DOFLAMINGO] Now let's
move onto the Two-stars.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:30.406
[laughing] And now, let's move
onto the head honchos.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.912
I present to you
the Three-stars!

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.916
[ALL cheering]

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:43.499
[DOFLAMINGO] And finally,
there's one man in particular

00:04:43.534 --> 00:04:47.341
who aroused my indignation and
resentment more than the others.

00:04:47.374 --> 00:04:49.579
You can direct all
complaints to this guy

00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:51.216
as he's the reason
you're all forced

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.520
to play this ruthless game.

00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:56.827
And the person who kills him
will get a hearty reward:

00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.899
500 million berries!

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.085
[ALL cheering]

00:05:09.118 --> 00:05:11.957
[USOPP]
F-F-Five stars?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.132
Soldier's there? He turned back
into a human, didn't he?

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:18.937
Tell me, Lucy! What is he like?

00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:23.714
That's a funny question!
You mean you don't know?

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:26.152
That one-legged soldier, right?

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:28.256
He's your father.

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.494
Happiness will return to you.

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.934
Until then, I will
stay by your side!

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:37.842
[REBECCA]
I thought so!

00:05:37.876 --> 00:05:39.713
I promise I'm gonna
give Doflamingo

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:42.017
the biggest beating
of his life for you!

00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.423
Make sure you guys all
live to see it, okay?

00:05:45.457 --> 00:05:48.262
I'll end his stupid
game in no time!

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:51.837
So stay safe! You hear me?

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.372

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.880
Luffy, what's your current
status? Who's there?

00:06:29.913 --> 00:06:34.488
Zoro's with me, and
Traffy is, too. And uh...

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:38.330

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:43.607
Viola, too? No way!

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.749
Great. That's five total?
Stay safe.

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.620
[gasps]

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:52.625
[LUFFY] Huh. Something
the matter, Robin?

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.566
[SABO chuckles]

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:01.944
[sighs] Nothing. We're fine.

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:06.519
I'm with Usopp and Rebecca.
We'll head over.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.565
[LAW] Do you even know what
you're doing, Straw Hat?

[LUFFY grunts]

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:15.905
Maybe you need a reminder?

00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:17.975
We were supposed to
destroy the factory

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:23.253
in order to provoke a conflict
between Kaido and Doflamingo.

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:24.690
Did it ever cross your mind

00:07:24.723 --> 00:07:27.261
that if we prematurely
kill that bastard,

00:07:27.294 --> 00:07:32.404
it'll only cause Kaido to
redirect his anger at us?

00:07:32.438 --> 00:07:37.982
Is that what you really want?
To take on a pissed off Emperor?

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:51.009
Things don't always
work out. We have to.

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:52.277
[gasps]

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.014
Did you even think
of the kingdom?

00:07:54.048 --> 00:07:57.788
If we chicken out now,
what'll happen to it?

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:11.717
[TOWNSMAN A] Be on the lookout
for those criminals!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.390
Capturing them is gonna be
our only way outta this!

00:08:15.424 --> 00:08:16.492
Find any?

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:18.997
No, not yet at least.

Well, Admiral. What's the plan?
Get Doflamingo?

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:55.036
These people need our help.
We'll restrain the rowdy ones.

00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:59.177
After that, we'll set our sights
on Straw Hat and Law.

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:00.347
Huh?

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.185
You heard me. Tell our men.

Well, let's go!

00:09:06.793 --> 00:09:09.365
Wait! What about my handcuffs?

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:11.035
They'll fall off eventually.

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:13.039
That's not how it works!

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:14.909
One sec. I'll help.

[LAW]
You know where the key is?

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.253
[VIOLET]
Mm. Sort of. It fell.

[VIOLET gasps]

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:42.064
It has to be somewhere
around this plateau.

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:43.967
Just wait. I'll look.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.873

Why are so many people pouring

00:10:12.457 --> 00:10:13.961
out of the Colosseum?

[MARINE E]
Wh-What the hell's going on?

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:17.668
[MARINE F]
The whole structure shifted.

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:19.939
I think they're coming
from the underground.

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:22.845
Careful! I bet
they're the ex-toys.

00:10:22.878 --> 00:10:25.651
They don't look too happy to me!

00:10:25.684 --> 00:10:27.021
Enraged soldiers!

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:30.995
Aggravated officials!
And rowdy pirates!

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.832
I can't really blame
them if they riot

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:34.969
as a result of their injustices.

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:37.942
How did this many
people go unnoticed?

00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:41.883
[panting] Where's
Straw Hat, huh?

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:51.937
Hey, Maynard! You owe me
an explanation as to why

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.011
you entered the tournament!
That was way out of line.

00:10:56.044 --> 00:10:59.819
You're lucky to
be alive, really!

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:01.924
[pants] Just hear me out.

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:05.698
I got an inside look and learned
some real dirty details.

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.035
We gotta take Doflamingo
into custody.

00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:11.342
I'm telling you, it's for
the good of the whole world.

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.245
Where's Issho?

[KOALA]
Finally, some alone time.

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:34.555
Now I can wrap up
my investigation

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:36.960
without any interruptions.

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:47.180
Interesting...

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:53.828
An imposter pirate ship!

00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.967
And it's from the
Kingdom of Biggschots.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.971
So nations from
all over the world

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:01.876
use this port for secret deals?

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.050
[PIRATE A] I dunno man,
what are we supposed to do?

00:12:05.083 --> 00:12:07.153

all over this place!

We'll have our asses
handed to us

if they find out we've been
trading with Doflamingo!

[PIRATE B]
Panicking's not gonna help.

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.469
We gotta cover our
tracks and wait.

[PIRATE C] Damn, I wish we
could take the boat and bail.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:21.348

and destroy the evidence.

Why not, Issho?

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:29.518
Doflamingo is unfit to be a
Warlord! We have to stop him!

00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:49.058
We can't make that call.

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:51.863
We've been doing it
like that too long.

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:55.203
The same old song
and dance every time.

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:57.775
You've been in the Navy
for quite a while,

00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.645
if I recall, Vice Admiral?

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:02.050
Huh?

00:14:02.084 --> 00:14:03.887
[FUJITORA]
Don't tell me you never once

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:06.324
opened your ears
this whole time?

00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:10.935
You hear those screams?
That's not fear. It's rage.

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:14.776
No, those aren't the cries
of terrified folks.

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.113
They're furious.

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:26.198
That's why the World Government
has no business playing God!

00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.634
[gasps]

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.816
[FUJITORA]
My decision stands.

00:14:34.849 --> 00:14:38.122
This matter is not
up for discussion.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.763
[DIAMANTE] So, they're all
after the SMILEs, right?

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:01.101
[TREBOL]
Yeah, Doffy! I don't get it!

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:04.174
Don't we need to
protect the factory?

00:15:04.207 --> 00:15:06.278
[DOFLAMINGO]
They won't get by the doors.

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:09.317
They are Sea Prism
Stone, after all.

00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:13.794
Besides, I have
the keys right here.

00:15:13.827 --> 00:15:15.263
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:16.098
Whoa! What?

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:17.735
You sure that's smart?

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:24.214
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
I don't owe them a drop of hope.

00:15:24.247 --> 00:15:27.454
Trebol. You're useless.
I can't believe

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:31.462
babysitting was that
challenging for you. Goon.

00:15:31.495 --> 00:15:36.005
You're the goon! Besides, old
man, she's not really a kid!

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:40.013
Hey, hey. Doffy.
I'm sorry about Sugar!

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:41.716
Please don't get mad at me.

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:43.787
That guy had his arms
and legs bound!

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.563
I didn't think he'd be able
to pull off a trick like that!

00:15:48.596 --> 00:15:50.466
I really messed that up, huh?

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:54.441
I, too, goofed. My bad. I didn't
think I'd have to deal with

00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:56.946
the Revolutionary Army's
second-in-command

00:15:56.979 --> 00:15:58.449
all of a sudden.

00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.386
We just weren't ready.

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:01.956
Yeah, yeah!

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.161
Huh. Quit making excuses!

00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:11.242
It's gross, and that's
with a capitol G!

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:14.448
[DOFLAMINGO] It's in the past,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:15.884
We can't turn back time,

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:18.488
and blaming you
wouldn't do me any good.

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:21.929
Yeah! That's why you're
the number one boss, Doffy!

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:24.536
[laughs] Hear that, Lao G?

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:27.641
I'll accept your
forgiveness if you insist!

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:30.413
By the way, what about Fujitora?

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:32.518
I think when push
comes to shove,

00:16:32.552 --> 00:16:34.254
he'll be a problem.

00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:36.491
I already had a chat with him.

00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:40.232
I assure you, the Marines
will stay off our backs.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:46.378
But once we're done using him,
I need him gone.

00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:47.648
[FUJITORA]
Once that is settled,

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:50.854
I'll be taking care
of you... personally.

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.591
[DOFLAMINGO]
Excuse me?

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:54.995
[FUJITORA] Now I may be
a newcomer to this game,

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:57.467
recruited through the
World Military Draft.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.007
But since I was appointed to
the position of Navy Admiral,

00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:03.914
I've got but a
simple goal in mind.

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:05.584
I won't stop till I witness

00:17:05.617 --> 00:17:10.159
the complete abolition of
the Seven Warlords system!

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:13.398
[DOFLAMINGO] No good will come
from keeping him alive.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:17.173
Although, taking him out
will be a real chore.

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:35.677
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.259
All right!
Let's hit the next area!

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:45.329
Restrain anyone
who's out of control!

00:17:45.362 --> 00:17:49.171
Let's find the Straw Hat
pirates and Trafalgar Law!

00:17:49.204 --> 00:17:50.740
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.316
That's funny.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.957
It seems like we are invisible
to the Marines, huh?

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.132
Agreed. I hope. They're showing
respect to the Young Master,

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.571
but maybe it's all a set up.

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:08.677
Ah! Or maybe they're
wetting their uniforms

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:09.979
because of the Birdcage!

00:18:10.012 --> 00:18:12.818
Anyway, what I wanna know is

00:18:12.851 --> 00:18:16.191
how that pervert found the
strength to cut and run.

00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:18.462
Also, where the hell is he?

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:20.466
I'd like to know that myself.

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:23.206
He sure did take quite
the beat-een, huh?

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:25.076
He can't have gotten
too far though with

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:26.378
as many people controlled by

00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:29.083
the Young Master's
ability, yeah?

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:32.558
[grunts] Give him some credit.
Dunno about you,

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:36.699
but that guy's iron will
shook me to my core.

00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:38.135
Listen up, losers!

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:41.041
I'm gonna go nuts and wreck
this place all day long!

00:18:41.074 --> 00:18:43.646
Don't ask me why!

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.748
[MACHVISE]
Uhh...

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:46.451
[DELLINGER]
Uh?

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:54.635
Anyway, we're going to need
to get serious here.

00:18:54.669 --> 00:19:00.246
I think we'll have to go all
out to finally put him down.

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:04.454
[WOMEN]
Ooh! So hard-boiled!

00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:14.140
I bet that's gotta be
the SMILE factory!

00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:16.445
Crazy how it's out in
the open like that!

00:19:16.478 --> 00:19:21.856
It's practically beggin'
for a laser beam! [laughs]

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:27.868
Why is there a balloon fall-een?

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.638
[SEÑOR]
Huh?

00:19:33.045 --> 00:19:34.948
[WOMEN yelp]

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.792
[WOMEN gasping]

00:19:39.825 --> 00:19:43.600
I won't always be here.
Ladies, watch yourselves.

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:46.706
[LUFFY grunting]

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:47.974
[MACHVISE]
Law!

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.814
You must have some massive
cojones on you showing up here!

00:19:50.847 --> 00:19:54.721
Oh? That's Big Brother Law,
all grown up?

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:57.795
H-Hey.

00:19:57.828 --> 00:19:59.565
Oh, no!

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:03.607
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.545
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
And Trafalgar Law!

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:08.983
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C]
And the Pirate Hunter!

00:20:12.156 --> 00:20:14.795
Crap! I shoulda picked
a better spot!

00:20:14.828 --> 00:20:16.364
Hey, Straw Hat.

00:20:16.397 --> 00:20:19.905
When these cuffs are off,
I'll kill you myself!

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:21.575
C'mon, Law. Not his fault.

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:26.352
No place is safe. Anywhere
we land, everyone's an enemy.

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:28.089
Now shut up. Let's run.

00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.490
Right!

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:31.328
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
After them!

00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:33.399
[LUFFY]
Not that way, Zoro!

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:36.104
[LAW]
Not that way either, Straw Hat!

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:37.975
[TOWNSMAN M]
We found some of the fugitives!

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:41.314
[TOWNSMAN N] I think it's two
Three-stars and a Two-star!

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:42.651
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Don't let them escape!

00:20:42.685 --> 00:20:45.289
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
Stop!

00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:48.328
[DELLINGER] Big Brother Law,
it's so nice to see you!

00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:50.801
Who's this kid? Do you know him?

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:54.007
[LAW] That's Dellinger.
Take extra precaution with him.

00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:55.777
Huh?

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:58.348
[laughing] Not bad!

00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:02.724
[gasping]

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:06.031
I tripped! Some weird swimming
man-baby grabbed me!

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:08.335
Vise! You're up!

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:14.314
Watch out! He'll crush you
with his super-weight powers!

00:21:14.347 --> 00:21:15.617
Let go of me!

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.855
[MACHVISE]
Ton Ton! Ten-Ton Vise!

00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:20.794
[LUFFY yells]

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:26.404
[LUFFY grunting]
I'm stuck. I can't get free!

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.979
[MACHVISE chuckles]

00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:31.281
[laughs]

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:36.525
Last time I made a boo-boo!
Pistol High Heel!

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:40.032
[MACHVISE grunting]

00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:41.902
No!

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:44.307
Ow!

00:21:45.076 --> 00:21:47.046
Yes! My legs are free!

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:49.652
[ZORO]
Great! Let's go.

00:21:49.685 --> 00:21:52.858
Hold up! You're worth
800 million berries!

00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:53.960
We'll kill you!

00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:55.730
Fire!

00:21:58.736 --> 00:21:59.706
[LUFFY grunts]

00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:02.544
--[LUFFY yelling]
--[TOWNSPEOPLE groaning]

00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:08.022
[TOWNSMAN P] Whatever you do,
don't let them get away!

00:22:08.055 --> 00:22:09.558
Damn! What a pain.

00:22:09.592 --> 00:22:11.729
I wish the townsfolk
would back off!

00:22:11.762 --> 00:22:14.167
I don't feel right hurtin' 'em.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.371
Yeah. I'll use my Haki!

00:22:16.404 --> 00:22:17.808
[FUJITORA]
Shut it down.

00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.579
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasping]

00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:20.914
[FUJITORA]
He who shoots often

00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:25.156
may sometimes hit at last,
but not in this case.

00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:27.694
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasping]

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:37.079
[ZORO growls]

00:22:42.423 --> 00:22:51.976
[TOWNSMEN gasping]

00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:00.893
The Navy Admiral.

00:23:02.397 --> 00:23:05.002
It's the gambling old guy!

00:23:13.652 --> 00:23:16.391
[NARRATOR] Luffy and Zoro
have a run in with Fujitora!

00:23:16.424 --> 00:23:18.763
As the clash rages on,
a tremendous power

00:23:18.796 --> 00:23:20.700
starts shaking the
heavens and earth.

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.971
It's revealed to be
the Top Executive Pica

00:23:23.004 --> 00:23:25.176
finally showing the
extent of his strength.

00:23:25.209 --> 00:23:26.679
With his immeasurable size,

00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:29.383
he threatens to crush Luffy,
along with the entire kingdom!

00:23:29.417 --> 00:23:31.154
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.187 --> 00:23:32.757
"With a Rumbling of the Ground!

00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:36.297
The God of Destruction -
Giant Pica Descends!"

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.136
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
