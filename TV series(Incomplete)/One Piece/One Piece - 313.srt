00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,705
We're picking it up here at
the train station as we speak!

177
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,908
Your 200 million Berry treasure!

178
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,076
This is gonna be sweet!

179
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,454
[knocking]

180
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,992
Hope everyone's decent!

181
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,059
[SANJI] Oh, hey, Kokoro.

182
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,661
Yo, we're comin' through!

183
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,896
[SANJI] Sure. Good to see ya.

184
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,998
Meow! Meow!

185
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,265
Gero!

186
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,341
[KOKORO] I think
you better wait outside.

187
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,080
Gero! Gero!

188
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,683
[KOKORO] You boys have
been sleeping for days!

189
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,518
You musta been awfully pooped!

190
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,855
Not that I blame you,
after all that fighting.

191
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:36,123
Well!

192
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:38,325
Mister Pirate King
is back on his feet, too!

193
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:40,494
Uh, actually, not so much.

194
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,262
And what's that
supposed to mean?

195
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,531
Even though he couldn't
move after the last fight,

196
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,334
he didn't wanna miss dinner
'cause he was sleeping.

197
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,406
[SANJI] So he developed
the sleep-eating technique

198
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,140
you see here.

199
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,942
[KOKORO] He's still asleep?

200
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,811
Whoa! That's so cool!

201
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,112
Meow!

202
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,947
[KOKORO] That's what
you call multitalented!

203
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,117
[laughing]

204
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,619
By the way, your
Log Pose should be set

205
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:08,054
after another 2 or 3 days here.

206
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,257
[KOKORO]
Oh goodness, what happened?

207
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,027
Even if the Log Pose is set,

208
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,430
it's not like we can
go anywhere without a ship.

209
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,934
All the money we
saved up to buy a new ship

210
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,570
is gone forever.

211
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,204
Our clothes, furniture,

212
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,207
even Bellemere's precious
tangerine trees were lost.

213
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,777
Aqua Laguna
carried it all away.

214
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,345
I'm so depressed,
I can't even move.

215
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,348
[KOKORO] Sorry I said anything.

216
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,552
We left our stuff in
one of the backstreet hotels.

217
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:42,890
Oh, so that's what your
guests are here about.

218
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:43,690
Our guests?

219
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:44,824
[knocking sound]

220
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:49,229
[CITIZEN 313F]
Um, so, funny story.

221
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:51,832
My trees!

222
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:52,966
Oh my gosh!

223
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,236
I thought I'd
never see them again!

224
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:56,870
--I'm so happy!
--Yeah...

225
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,138
Sorry about
kicking you out,

226
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,207
but we thought you tried
to assassinate Iceberg.

227
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,209
We treated your belongings
as pirate loot,

228
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:04,078
so we confiscated everything.

229
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:04,912
[CITIZEN 313F]
I hope you're not mad.

230
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,480
Of course I'm not mad!

231
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,814
Thank you so much!

232
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,615
[laughing]

233
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,384
Well, there you go!

234
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,718
[CHOPPER] Hi!

235
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,354
Doctor Chopper, reporting in!

236
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:14,355
How are you?

237
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:16,991
[SANJI] I'm great
now that you're here!

238
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,425
Such a heavy bag!

239
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,027
Please, allow me.

240
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,161
If you must.

241
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,129
I treated the
Franky Family's wounds,

242
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,133
but I didn't let Robin out
of my sight for a single second!

243
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,401
[SANJI] Mission Complete!

244
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,403
[laughing]

245
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,138
I already told you
I'm not going anywhere!

246
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,372
[CHOPPER] You promise?

247
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,940
[ROBIN]
You have my word, soldier.

248
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,010
[NAMI] Guys, look!
Can you believe it?

249
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,945
My tangerine trees are okay!

250
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,913
We got our money back
and our stuff, too!

251
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,215
[CHOPPER] Really?

252
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,416
Once we buy a ship,
then we'll be good to go!

253
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,351
[CHOPPER]
All right! That's great!

254
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,020
[laughing]

255
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,228
Wow, baby!

256
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,665
You guys feelin super or what?

257
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,833
Oh. Some folks aren't here.

258
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:00,868
Whatever.

259
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,069
What's with the big entrance?

260
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,037
Something going on?

261
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,771
[FRANKY] You bet!

262
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:08,174
Now, better
listen close, brother.

263
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:31,732
So there's this island
that's always at war.

264
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,266
[SANJI]
Wait, stop. I don't care.

265
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,203
If you're here to tell bedtime
stories, go bother someone else.

266
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:39,406
[FRANKY] Shut up!
This is important--Listen!

267
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,109
For years, fire has
rained on that island.

268
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,645
Death and destruction
are the only things

269
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,946
that its people know.

270
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,449
[FRANKY] Houses burn down;
cities fall to ruin.

271
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,851
There's no place to
run from all the chaos.

272
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:55,088
And in the midst of all this
madness, there's a single tree.

273
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,524
[FRANKY] No matter what
happens, it never falls,

274
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,727
and no matter how much
the island is destroyed,

275
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,064
its people gather around
it and build it all up again.

276
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,268
[FRANKY] It's the strongest
tree in the world.

277
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:11,105
As far as anyone knows,
only a few exist.

278
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,541
It's known as
the Jewel Tree, Adam.

279
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:15,709
Huh?

280
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,145
Okay. So what?

281
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,614
[FRANKY] Every so often a
piece of wood from that tree

282
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,216
shows up on the black market.

283
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,452
I've wanted one
for a long time now,

284
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,656
but the going price
is 200 million Berries.

285
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,357
Too expensive for me.

286
00:16:30,391 --> 00:16:32,726
That is, until a bunch
of pirates showed up,

287
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,596
flailing their money around
and begging me to take it.

288
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,597
Bastard!

289
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,165
You used our money
to buy some stupid log

290
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,566
and then you brag about it?

291
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,401
I told you, shut up!

292
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,278
[FRANKY] A long time ago,

293
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,581
I decided that I was
done building ships

294
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,382
for the rest of my life.

295
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,185
And yet, I couldn't help
but follow in the footsteps

296
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,586
of my old master.

297
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,123
And soon enough, I found
myself designing a ship.

298
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:10,131
Now, my hope is to use
that special wood to build it--

299
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,666
To put all my heart
into one last ship.

300
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,336
A ship of dreams that
can sail across any sea!

301
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,348
[FRANKY] I've had the
blueprints for ages.

302
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,817
Now I finally have the wood.

303
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,153
All that's left is to make it.

304
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:36,389
So what I'm saying here

305
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:40,694
is it would be my honor
if you'd take my ship

306
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,029
and sail the world!

307
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,139
Wait, so does that mean--

308
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,709
You--You're gonna give us
the ship, free of charge?

309
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,111
Uh-huh!
'Cause that way,

310
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,379
I'll know my masterpiece
is in good hands.

311
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,082
Trust me, that's
all I could ask for.

312
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,119
[FRANKY] Well, that, and you
kinda paid for it already.

313
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,320
Gold Roger is
the only man in history

314
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,156
who's sailed
across the whole world,

315
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,991
and his ship, the Oro Jackson,

316
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,594
was made from
a jewel tree, as well.

317
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:15,428
Mark my words.

318
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:19,066
I'll show you the best
damn ship you've ever seen!

319
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,835
Heh. You're a
shipwright after all.

320
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,203
You can pretend all you like,

321
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:26,407
but in the end, you're
just like old Tom, ain't ya?

322
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,543
[chuckling]

323
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:30,878
Guess you're right.

324
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,445
I get it now.

325
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,617
It took a while,

326
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:42,389
but I think I finally understand
the pride Tom felt when he died.

327
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,459
[ALL cheering]

328
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,128
[CHOPPER]
You're the best, Franky!

329
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,396
Thank you!
We'd be happy to take your ship!

330
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,865
[SANJI] All right!
Now on to the next island!

331
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,500
[NAMI] Luffy! Did you hear that?

332
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,568
We have a new ship!

333
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,737
Gero! Gero!

334
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:59,573
[YOKOZUNA]
Gero!

335
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,151
This is bad.

336
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:12,953
I didn't think those bastards
would come after us so soon.

337
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,222
Damn it, and I bet
Luffy's still sleeping, too!

338
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,457
[ZORO] I gotta warn 'em
before it's too late!

339
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,396
No way!

340
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:26,099
The ocean?

341
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,703
Can't remember.

342
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,338
Is it the other way?

343
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,453
What?

344
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,321
Not again!

345
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,557
Damn! Stupid ocean's everywhere!

346
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,790
This sucks!

347
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,760
[CITIZEN 313E] It's the Navy!

348
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:55,429
They're here
to arrest the pirates!

349
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,297
[CITIZEN 313G] Even after
they saved the mayor's life,

350
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,066
they won't show them any mercy?

351
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,768
Hey! You see that over there?

352
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,804
That's Vice-Admiral Garp's ship!

353
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:05,139
Straight from Headquarters!

354
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,673
[CITIZEN 313F]
Wait, did you say "Garp?"

355
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,576
The same Garp that
nearly captured Gold Roger

356
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,178
over and over again?

357
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,246
He's a living legend!

358
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,649
[CITIZEN 313G] They're not
messing around if they sent him.

359
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,451
[CITIZEN 313H] If they don't
run, those pirates are finished!

360
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:29,863
What the hell's going on here?

361
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,499
Don't tell me this
is the same beach?

362
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,368
[ZORO] I don't have time
for this crap right now!

363
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,473
Well!
Would you look at that!

364
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,707
I guess he's lost!

365
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,876
Heh!

366
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,077
Well, that's too bad!

367
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,718
[MICHAEL] Hey pal, are you lost?

368
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:52,986
You new around town?

369
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,322
[HOICHAEL] Turn around.
Let's see your face.

370
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:58,225
Huh?

371
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,300
[SHIPWRIGHT 313A]
Now hold on, sir.

372
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:10,837
The only person here is
our president, Mr. Iceberg.

373
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,972
[GARP] Move it!

374
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,140
I know you're
hiding those pirates.

375
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:14,374
[SHIPWRIGHT 313A]
I swear, we're not!

376
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,442
[SHIPWRIGHT 313B] Hey!
You can't go inside!

377
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,477
Hold on!
The Straw Hats are heroes!

378
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,112
--They--
--Shut up!

379
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,195
All right, you two.
Wait here.

380
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,663
[COBY and HELMEPPO]
Yes, sir!

381
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,542
[chuckling]

382
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,212
[shrieking]

383
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:55,515
What the hell?

384
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,150
What's going on?

385
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,023
[GARP] Pardon me,

386
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,659
but are you folks
the Straw Hat Pirates?

387
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:07,460
You see,
I have some friends here

388
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,798
that would like to share
a word with Monkey D. Luffy.

389
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,532
--The Navy?
--The Navy?

390
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:14,634
[snoring]

391
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,571
Dumb kid. Never learns.

392
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,372
Just as careless as ever.

393
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:24,811
What?

394
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,380
Damn, he's fast!

395
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,248
Rise and shine!

396
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:34,187
No!

397
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,024
Ow! That hurt!

398
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,392
--Ow!
--What happened?

399
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,728
Why would one little
punch hurt you so much?

400
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,263
You're made of rubber!

401
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:46,366
It's because there is no
defense against a fist of love.

402
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,402
You've been getting
in a lot of trouble lately,

403
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,637
haven't you?

404
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,904
Luffy.

405
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:54,608
G-G-G-Grandpa?

406
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,310
[SANJI] Huh?

407
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,949
[ALL] What?

408
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,618
[CHOPPER] A Marine Vice
Admiral is your...

409
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,553
[FRANKY, NAMI, SANJI, CHOPPER]
...grandpa?

410
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:13,961
[SANJI] So all this time,

411
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,930
Luffy's grandpa was
some kinda Navy hero

412
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:17,097
and he never told us?

413
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,799
[CHOPPER screaming]

414
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,233
[CHOPPER]
Forget about that, Sanji!

415
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:21,502
Luffy's in trouble!

416
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,170
[SANJI] What the hell
is with his family?

417
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:24,438
Clearly, they have issues.

418
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,373
[ZORO] Damn it!
This is a waste of time!

419
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,609
I gotta get back to
the rest of the crew!

420
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,478
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

421
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,879
The Strongest Family?

422
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,747
Luffy's Father Revealed!

423
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,383
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
