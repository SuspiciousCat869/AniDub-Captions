Damn this guy. What now?

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.024
[FRANKY] Hah! Don't worry--
there's plenty more

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.659

--Show 'em who's boss!
--You're the best general ever!

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE I]
Hey.

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:13.485
You must be one of

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE I]
Huh...?

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.171
Time for the Gust Sword!

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.674

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:42.982
I learned that back
in Weatheria.

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:45.484
That's hardcore meteorology.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.161
Now who's weak?

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:21.120
[USOPP] Uh? Wait a sec.
Where's Chopper?

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:23.589
Come on, let's get
that guy over there!

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.757
[USOPP]
Aw, man!

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.459
Guess I'm officially
off the tank now.

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:32.164
Guess I've
gotta fight by myself.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.334
You don't scare me!

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:38.370
I'm not some little weenie
like I was before!

Ha-ha! I hope
you're proud, Master!

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.426
[USOPP] I'll never forget those
two crazy years I spent

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.661
training with you in
the Swindling Forest!

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.366
This is the
next chapter of life!

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:09.668
The Legend of
the Great Hero Usopp

[DARUMA]
Kya-kya-kya!

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:20.679
I'm gonna dig sink holes
all over this plaza!

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:21.847
It doesn't matter how powerful

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.450
that ridiculous robot is,
if he drives it into a hole,

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.652
--then it's all over!
--[crunching]

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:30.289

That can't be right...

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:33.292
Sounds like someone
else is here.

[DARUMA]
Huh?

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.001
[DARUMA]
Uh...?

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.206

Ah!

Look close!

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.321
[gasping]

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.463
I can dig holes, too!

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:14.600
My Horn Point really
came in handy, huh?

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:16.068
That's cool!

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:17.269
[DARUMA]
Huh?

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.504
Wow!

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.540
You could turn into a big, hairy
bug, and you never told me?

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.308
Oh, that is so rude!

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:25.144
You should know.

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.846
I spent the last two years
working on all seven

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.749
of my transformation points!

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.985
Now, I'm so good that
I only need the Rumble Ball

00:17:33.018 --> 00:17:35.154
for one of them.

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:38.924
So I can use all my other
forms whenever I want to!

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:41.126
You coral-head pain in the ass!

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.162
Kya! I'm so gonna bite you!

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:44.696
[CHOPPER] They're
not coral, they're horns!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.198
Like a monster!

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:50.903
And you are about to see
what this monster can do!

Looks like they're having
a blast out there!

00:17:58.477 --> 00:17:59.678
If I had powers like that,

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.814
I'd wanna let loose
on those jerks, too!

I don't know what you did
to gain Straw Hat's trust,

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.591
but that doesn't matter.

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:47.626
You might salvage this yet.

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:50.028
You've got the princess
where I want her.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:53.499

[SURUME gasps]

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:05.844
[HORDY] I know exactly
where he is right now.

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:10.616
My men and I can go there and
slaughter him anytime we please.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.819
I wouldn't mind
killing you or your family.

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:16.855

because you're on my side right?

[JIMBEI]
What?

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:31.770
So the Kraken agreed to do
Hordy's bidding to ensure

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:33.605
the safety of his brother?

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.714
This is your last chance.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.584

[LUFFY]
I know what that's like.

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:30.662
So, is he your big brother,
or your little brother?

Huh...?

Shirahoshi stands in its way to

is dwarfed by the size
