1
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:36,145
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,885
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,487
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:43,459
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,029
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,769
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,472
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:52,444
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:55,250
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:56,888
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,456
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,797
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,236
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,577
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:11,783
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:16,526
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,238
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:24,475
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,514
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,018
After overcoming a
trap set by the Navy,

21
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,924
he flies toward the scaffold,
his goal in sight.

22
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,428
The Whitebeard Pirates
soon joined Luffy,

23
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:37,167
using a paddle boat that was
hidden at the bottom of the bay

24
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,942
to break into the plaza,
where the battle rages on!

25
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:44,248
[LUFFY]
Now for Second Gear!

26
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,217
[LUFFY grunts]

27
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,219
[gasps]

28
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:50,393
Huh. You almost made it.

29
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:53,567
[LUFFY yells]

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,873
[PIRATE GG] Everyone, swim
across the bay towards Oars!

31
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,184
[PIRATES grunting]

32
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,873
Sir, we have a problem!

33
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,477
Another coated pirate ship
is about to enter the bay,

34
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:17,615
and it's coming fast!

35
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,095
Now sink that thing!

36
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:26,232
Drop it like the Moby Dick!

37
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,005
Cease fire!

38
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,609
The ship is too fast.

39
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:32,845
Aim your fire at Oars!

40
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:40,528
[OARS JR. roaring]

41
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,410
[MARINE FF]
That's insane!

42
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,782
He plucked the ship
right out of the bay!

43
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,017
[MARINE GG]
This is bad.

44
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:54,723
They've broken through
the encircling walls!

45
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:58,163
That's enough!

46
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,970
[WHITEBEARD]
My sons. Please, stay back.

47
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:08,951

[MARINES screaming]

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,244
Listen up, pirates!

50
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,348
Bring Ace to safety.

51
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:28,591
And once you're done
with that, destroy the Navy!

52
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:35,337
[PIRATES shouting]

53
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,675
[SENGOKU]
Are you with me?

54
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,278
[GARP]
Yeah.

55
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,656
I fear we can't
hold back any more.

56
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:48,029
This battle may be our last.

00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,874
[LUFFY]
"Luffy at the End of His Tether!

58

[IVANKOV gasping]

61
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,442
The show's over for any poor sap
who possesses Devil Fruit powers

62
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:14,716
and falls into the sea! [gasps]

63
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,089
How tragic...
to end... like this!

64
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:21,663

[IVANKOV]
Or not!

67
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,252
Another glorious maneuver to
escape certain death! [laughs]

68
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:35,123
[JIMBEI]
What are you doing, Ivankov?

69
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:36,492
[IVANKOV]
Shh.

70
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,895
Now, then.

71
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:40,535
I wonder what's going on.

72
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,441
[gasps] I cannot believe
he just shushed me.

[PIRATE BB]
I've been hit!

76
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,493
While I'm here just
trying to stay afloat,

77
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:56,967
the real struggle's
happening on the other side.

78
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,841
Oh, no. Please tell me
you're not already...

79
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,977
...boiled alive!

Burnt to a crisp!

81
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:05,183
Or frozen solid!

82
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,419
Poor boy.

Stop that, we need to hurry!

00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:15,370
Hey! This entire mess
is all your fault!

87
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,207
It is? How so?

Don't play dumb!

You're a Warlord--
or, ex-Warlord!

You were supposed to defeat
the Navy and rescue Ace Boy!

[JIMBEI]
I don't think that's possible/

and be quick.

Oh, no.

104
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,765
He broke out!

105

Those vibrations
can't be frozen!

106

How come? Why haven't
they surrendered yet?

Damn it!

Whitebeard and Straw Hat
are almost to the scaffold!

I'll be even stronger!

Strong enough to capture you!

that I'll keep trying...

...till I become
a Marine admiral!

improved a bit!

no matter how
courageous you may be,

183
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:18,651
[HELMEPPO] He... He just can't
compete with the admirals!

184
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:20,286
No way.

185
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,290
Luffy, get up!

Hey! That's Ace's brother!

Ace...

195
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,035
Huh.

196
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:37,642
Well, seems the
Whitebeard brand

197
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,845
is losing some of its punch.

198
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,818
[KIZARU] Surely you could
have done better than

199
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:45,022
let that youngster
lead the attack.

200
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,827
I mean, look at him.

[KIZARU]
The boy is hardly breathing.

203
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,470
Guess that's partially my fault.

204
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:58,282
Save Pops! Let's block the beam!

205
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,821
[KIZARU]
What a devoted crew.

206
00:16:00,855 --> 00:16:03,693
[IVANKOV]
I've spotted him! Straw Boy!

207
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,764
Right over there, Jimbei!

208
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:06,933
[KIZARU]
Huh?

209
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,902
Who's that?

210
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,041
And where is it coming from?

[PIRATES gasp]

212
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:14,815
Huh?

Just as I suspected!

214
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:19,190
Didn't I tell you Luffy
was gonna be in trouble?

215
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:21,194
What the?

216
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,567
That face--
Why is it so gigantic?

217
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,369
I don't know. I think
he just does that.

218
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:26,338
[JIMBEI]
Luffy!

219
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,011
Is he still alive?
Say something!

Sorry!

227
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:46,445

232
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:57,267
I'm so close to him! Let go!

233
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,674
Enough. He's done his fair
share of good. Treat him.

...needs me!

Please!

He's my only brother!
I can't lose him, I can't!

I'd rather die!

At any cost... I've gotta--!

I promise I will!

246
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,888
I'll save him!

Please, Surgeon!

Do everything within
your power to help him!

252
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,223
Stay with us, friend!

253
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,231
He's nothing but
a big-mouthed kid

254
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,868
who goes looking for trouble.

255
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,104
Dumb and clumsy.

256
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,874
Careless, too.

257
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,888

soft spot for fools like him.

00:23:25,644 --> 00:23:28,015
Refusing to relent,
Luffy begs Ivankov

360
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,252
for one last chance at victory.

361
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,123
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

362
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:34,394
"The Power That Will
Shorten One's Life!

363
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,495
Energy Hormone

364
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:39,337
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
