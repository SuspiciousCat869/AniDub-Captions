00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,222
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,959
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,527
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,065
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,868
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,536
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,472
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,342
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,977
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,512
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,948
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,185
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,588
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,758
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,429
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,435
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,671
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,405
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,275
However, the two could
not escape Admiral Akainu,

21
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,044
and Ace died protecting Luffy.

22
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,281
Then, suddenly, Blackbeard
appeared, killing Whitebeard

23
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:38,185
and accomplishing
something truly unthinkable.

24
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,053
[BLACKBEARD]
Just watch!

00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,323

We're all gonna die!

32

It's over...

33
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:30,637
There's nothing left.

[MARINES gasp, yell]

35
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,109
The pirates, they took
everything we had.

36
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,844
Our citadel, where we've watched

37
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,314
over these waters
for centuries...

38
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,282
It's all crumbling down.

The symbol of the
Navy's strength.

Damn!

43
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,997
He planned this from
the very start, didn't he?

44
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,131
He betrayed Whitebeard,

45
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,967
captured Ace and
became a Warlord,

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,069
all to force them
into this battle!

47
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:05,405
All right, then!
Take a good look,

00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,043

I can hardly blame 'em.

I'd be crying, too, if my
enemies had this kind of power!

Now what?

00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,150
[BLACKBEARD] Took some time,
but this is a hell of a payoff.

wrapped around my finger!

You can tear down our buildings,

we will rebuild them.

[SENGOKU]
But this island is different.

83
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,599
It's more than a symbol
of our strength,

84
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,235
it stands in the
center of the world.

86
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,440
And that means
if we want to protect

87
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,844
innocent people from
criminals such as yourself,

88
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:26,346
it must be our stronghold

89
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,817
so it's light can
reach every corner.

It defies chaos.

It doesn't perish,

93
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,126
and it will certainly
not sink by your hand.

happens when you defy the law.

This is justice!

They won't be up there long,

out for Straw Hat,

You're fools, each

00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,103
Is one boy so damned important

311

that you're willing to
throw your lives away?

You may mock us if you please,

313
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,244
but there is a strength
in Straw Hat's tenacity

314
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,713
that may prove
invaluable to this world.

315
00:19:39,747 --> 00:19:41,615
Pops bet his life on him.

316
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,485
He has to carry on Ace's legacy.

This is the dawn of a new era

318
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,322
and we have a duty
to see him through it.

00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,258
Noble sentiment from
a bunch of criminals,

320
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,828
but in the end,
it's just empty talk.

321
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,673
[AKAINU] I won't hesitate
to strike you down.

322
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,141
[MARCO]
Same here.

323
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:10,211
Your insistence
on killing Straw Hat

324
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,712
just proves to us how
much you fear him,

325
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,482
and if a tough guy like you
is scared of a boy like him,

326
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,617
that means he's
worth protecting,

327
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,953
to the death, if need be!

328
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:23,690
Ugh. Can't you jackasses
do anything without my help?

329
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,560
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

330
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,595
You didn't just
pass out, did you?

331
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,432
[gasps] Hey, I didn't mean
it buddy, don't die on me!

332
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,234
C'mon, you gotta
tell me where to go.

00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:36,803
I'm lost here! Help!

334
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,807
[CROCODILE] Frankly,
I should be applauding him

335
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,442
for making Straw Hat suffer,

336
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,144
but I suppose the pirate in me

337
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,580
would rather punch
him in the face.

338
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:50,483
[AKAINU] I see that trying to
reason with you is a lost cause.

339
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,120
Have it your way!

00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:09,603
This is too much.

[BUGGY yelps]

354
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:08,896
[BEPO] Captain, we found a spot
where the ice doesn't reach.

355
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,263
[LAW]
Then, surface.

356
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,100
[BUGGY yelling]

357
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:21,075
What is that?

358
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,777
It was underwater... A ship?

359
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,080
[PIRATE BB]
It's a submarine!

360
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,481
[PIRATE T]
Not another enemy, is it?

361
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,450
[PIRATE CC]
That's a jolly roger.

362
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:37,024
Huh? I don't take
orders from you, pal!

363
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:40,460
And besides, what do you want
with him anyway, ya weirdo?

364
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,629
Actually, who the hell are you?

365
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,999
[LAW] Straw Hat
may be my enemy someday,

366
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,301
but I'll let the fates
decide that one.

367
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,571
Either way, it'd be
a waste to let him die here.

368
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:52,906
Hand him over and we can escape.

369
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,708
He'll die without my help.

370
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,243
What?

371
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:06,086
Trust me. I'm a doctor.

372
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:14,661
[NARRATOR]
As senseless violence

373
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:16,764
dyes the battlefield
red with blood,

374
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,966
Luffy's allies
struggle to save him.

375
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,134
As the admirals
maintain their assault,

376
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,803
with the world
burning around him,

377
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,471
a boy who lacks
the will to fight

378
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:27,941
makes a stand that may change
the future of the entire world!

379
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,810
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

380
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,344
"The Desperate Scream!

381
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:34,248
Courageous Moments That
Will Change the Future"

382
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,449
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
