WEBVTT

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.548
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.932
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:04.435
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.952
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.229
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:20.333
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.475
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.516
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.387
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:32.525
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.030
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:37.000
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.906
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:51.095
[SEÑOR] I'm sorry.
I didn't want to lose you.

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.432
That's why I lied.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.707
Hey, Russian, look here.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.979
I found the same bonnet
that our Gimlet used to wear.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.251
[SEÑOR]
Don't I look like him?

00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:07.662
You used to say he
had my face. [chuckles]

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:15.678
[SEÑOR] I'll do anything.
Just show me that smile.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:21.088
I-I'm sorry.
That was a poor joke.

00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:24.562
And just imagine,
if somebody saw me.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:29.939
[gasping]

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.647
[LUFFY]
"Stardust of Death!

00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:37.354
Diamante's Storm
of Vicious Attacks!"

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.233
[NURSES gasping]

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.875
[ALL gasping]

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:21.676
[SEÑOR]
Good morning, Russian.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.357
[ALL laughing]

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.961
Aren't you a cutie?

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:07.601
Heard he lost his son,
and his wife's brain-dead.

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.473
[STREET WOMAN 716A] No wonder
he went off the deep end.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.718
[BOTH laughing]

00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:16.986
What is this?

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.329
The hell happened to your
fashion sense, Pink? [laughs]

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:25.605
[TREBOL]
Wow! Hey, you prankin' us?

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:27.307
[GLADIUS]
Where's your luxury suits?

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.247
You look goofy with a capital G!

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.687
Huh. I'm heading out.

00:06:34.422 --> 00:06:36.426
Look! It's a weirdo!

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.162
Keep walking, you perv!

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:39.832
[STREET WOMAN 716B]
What a creep.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.337
You can't just stroll
around in that get up.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.810
Don't look. Here he comes.

00:06:44.843 --> 00:06:47.180
Why's that moron
still wearing that junk?

00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:48.851
Look! It's a freak!

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:50.420
Hey! Stop that.

00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:36.813
[SEÑOR]
Russian. I'm sorry I'm late.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.788
Hey, Russian.

00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:26.614
[RUSSIAN] So, Honey.
What should we name him?

00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:30.354
He looks like a Gimlet.

00:08:30.387 --> 00:08:32.290
I think that suits him fine.

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:38.035
[GIMLET crying]

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:42.077
[SEÑOR]
Russian.

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:50.393
I look ridiculous,
but to me this silly outfit

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:54.234
is worth more than
the finest suit.

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:09.197
[SEÑOR] The only time
you smile for me anymore...

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:12.671
[SEÑOR]
...is when I wear this.

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.497
[RUSSIAN] Ah. It's a
wet one out there, huh?

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.002
Whew, I'm drenched. [giggles]

00:09:28.036 --> 00:09:32.611
What's so amusing?
Aren't you freezing cold?

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:37.121
It's fine. I love rain.
Feels nice.

00:09:37.154 --> 00:09:39.090
Don't you love it, too?

00:09:40.127 --> 00:09:41.796
The rain.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:47.307
[FRANKY yelling]

00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:57.628
[yelling]

00:10:04.074 --> 00:10:08.683
[panting]

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:13.092
[SEÑOR] Seems like the rain
you enjoyed so much...

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:17.267
[SEÑOR]
...finally let up.

00:10:29.157 --> 00:10:30.694
[SEÑOR gasps]

00:10:36.773 --> 00:10:38.242
[RUSSIAN]
Thanks, Honey.

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:50.801
[WOMEN]
Hang on! Señor!

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.974
[DWARVES] Fraland,
tell us that you're okay!

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.906
You're a real mess, bro.

00:11:09.939 --> 00:11:13.479
What's going through
your head right now?

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:17.053
What's making you
hurt like that?

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:36.926
[FRANKY]
Tell ya what.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.004
If we ever cross paths again,
let's have a round.

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:47.782
And you can tell me
all about that girl

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:50.253
who goes by "Russian."

00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.078
Now! Little People!

00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:21.950
Are you guys ready to wreck?

00:12:21.984 --> 00:12:25.023
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:28.363
This factory made
you Tontattas suffer!

00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:34.408
It's time to collect your
payback! Bust it up!

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:38.516
[DWARVES yell]

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.767
[FRANKY panting]

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.402
[DWARVES yelling]

00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:54.080
[panting]

00:12:54.114 --> 00:12:57.286
[FRANKY]
Good luck, little bros.

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:07.273
[FRANKY] The rest of this
is in your hands... Luffy.

00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:29.351
Send the rescue team over here!
There's injured people!

00:13:29.384 --> 00:13:30.486
[MARINE 716B]
Sir!

00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:34.227
[BOTH gasp]

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:40.239
Show Time! Mwah!

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:49.992
Yeah, it's the final
act of your wretched lives!

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:53.533
I hope you're ready to
put on a good show for me!

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.370
Since I already
offed your mom,

00:13:55.403 --> 00:14:00.514
it only makes sense to
wipe out the whole family!

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.865
Half Moon Glaive!

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:16.980
[DIAMANTE cackles]
Kyros! I thought you had it

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:19.318
up to here with me before.

00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:22.625
What happened to
all the big talk, huh?

00:14:23.392 --> 00:14:27.000
[DIAMANTE] Did you really think
I was just a gifted matador

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.240
whose name sends ripples
through the stadium?

00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:33.312
You may have been the strongest
competitor at one point,

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:35.751
but that wasn't meant
to last forever.

00:14:35.784 --> 00:14:39.525
I astound all while
slaying the competition.

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:43.132
The current hero
of the Colosseum

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:46.906
is the brilliant Diamante!

00:15:03.674 --> 00:15:07.447
The current hero
of the Colosseum

00:15:07.481 --> 00:15:10.587
is the brilliant Diamante!

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.225
The title means nothing to me!

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:18.402
Fame can be evasive,
I know! [cackles]

00:15:21.008 --> 00:15:23.445
[DIAMANTE]
Army Bandera!

00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:24.682
[KYROS gasps]

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:32.196
[cackling]

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:35.937
Be careful!

00:15:36.772 --> 00:15:39.845
A fine attempt!
You almost had me.

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:42.952
[panting]

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:46.091
[cackles] I can't blame you!

00:15:46.124 --> 00:15:49.097
You have been running around
the kingdom all day.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.601
Then you gotta
protect your daughter

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:54.708
and the ground's all
wobbly-- Life's crazy!

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:58.784
I'm afraid you're a day late
and leg short, my man!

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:01.589
Anyone would be
at their limit by now.

00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:02.991
Easy, Father!

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:06.632
[panting]

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:10.306
Any updates, Viola?
How is Kyros fairing in battle?

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.247
He's trying to hang in there,
but his body's exhausted.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.055
Brother Kyros.
You mustn't falter yet!

00:16:18.088 --> 00:16:21.762
Fight on. You must
avenge Scarlet.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.205
[KYROS panting]

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:30.413
[KYROS] Only a fool would
patronize me for my leg.

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:32.852
Really?

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:35.891
If I were to use that
as an excuse,

00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:37.628
I wouldn't have come here!

00:16:37.662 --> 00:16:39.064
I take great pride!

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:43.072
It was a small sacrifice
for the man who saved me!

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.474
[DIAMANTE]
If you say so!

00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:47.347
I won't feel guilty about
attacking your weak spot!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.184
But it won't be any fun for me

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.792
to utterly crush you while
you need your nappy-wappy.

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:55.129
So what do ya say?

00:16:55.163 --> 00:16:58.468
How about we pass the
time with a game, huh?

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:07.454
And now! The last showtime!

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:08.556
[gasps]

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:12.965
It's confetti.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.401
It's just paper?

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.404
[DIAMANTE]
Confetti? Yes!

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:17.542
Paper? No!

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:21.214
I wonder what the
mystery item could be!

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:25.757
And now for my next trick!

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.794
Ripple Release!

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.570
Spikey metal balls?

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:34.742
[DIAMANTE]
Look at the breathtaking sight!

00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:37.881
It like falling stardust!

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:38.950
[REBECCA]
Robin!

00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:40.386
[ROBIN]
We have no place to hide.

00:17:40.419 --> 00:17:43.326
[KYROS]
Robiland! Protect Rebecca!

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.262
[ROBIN] You're in danger,
too, Commander!

00:17:45.296 --> 00:17:48.236
[KYROS]
Do not waste concern on me!

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:52.511
What a great view!
The last one you'll see.

00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:57.387
I hate to boast, but my stardust
can wipe out an entire army.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.961
And it's nearly
impossible to survive.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:04.034
Luckily we are in this field.

00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:06.237
Mil Fleurs!

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:11.749
Forgive me, flowers.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.456
[DIAMANTE]
Heh.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:21.234
It's too bad you're not
under here! Adios, pal!

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.873
Death Enjambre!

00:18:28.616 --> 00:18:30.119
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:33.125
Flower Umbrella!

00:18:34.327 --> 00:18:36.098
That was a close one.

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.637
[DIAMANTE]
Oh, not too shabby!

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.641
[KYROS]
Pay attention!

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:41.809
[DIAMANTE]
Huh?

00:18:45.182 --> 00:18:47.621
Kyros! Wow!

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:54.602
Any army that would fall to this
trickery surely lacks training!

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.573
This is insanity!

00:18:56.606 --> 00:19:00.246
How are you smacking
my stardust away mid-air?

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:01.448
[KYROS grunts]

00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:03.252
[DIAMANTE]
Can you also walk through rain

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:04.822
without getting wet?

00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:06.926
[KYROS yelling]

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:08.596
Fine, then!

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:11.267
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:17.180
[screams]

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:19.652
[KYROS screams]

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:21.822
Father, no!

00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:26.465
[DIAMANTE cackles]
The sky is fallin', Kyros!

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:28.603
I bet you wouldn't have
stumbled if you still had

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:31.441
that extra leg
right about now, huh?

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:33.813
You can't do this
to him, Diamante!

00:19:33.846 --> 00:19:36.853
Stop it, Rebecca!
Please stay under the canopy!

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:38.590
[KYROS groaning]

00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:40.594
Father, no!

00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:42.597
[KYROS groaning]

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:46.304
[cackles] Do you know
this is the same gun I used

00:19:46.337 --> 00:19:49.979
to murder your
dear wife Scarlet?

00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:51.314
[gasps]

00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:55.857
[DIAMANTE] Come on.
Isn't it a little romantic

00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:58.663
that you get to go out
in the same way as her?

00:19:58.696 --> 00:20:00.199
You bastard!

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:02.738
I will never forgive you
for this, Diamante!

00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:06.145
[cackles] Fine!
Then don't forgive me!

00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:08.249
Come make me pay!

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:09.852
You want a piece?

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:11.923
I got a bullet for ya!

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.693
Just like your mommy.

00:20:13.727 --> 00:20:17.500
Please unhand me, Robin!
I have to kill this man!

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:19.605
[cackling]

00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:20.940
[KYROS groaning]

00:20:23.746 --> 00:20:25.182
[ROBIN]
I'm not sure how much more

00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:27.954
the Flower Umbrella
can withstand.

00:20:31.629 --> 00:20:36.337
Damn you to hell, Diamante!

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.724
[REBECCA]
No way.

00:20:45.758 --> 00:20:47.828
[gasping]

00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:59.651
Lower you weapon
right now, Rebecca!

00:21:02.423 --> 00:21:06.665
This is my fight!

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:12.578
Ten years you have
suffered on your own.

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:16.017
Come here! You need
to recover! You'll die!

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:21.094
For ten years, you've upheld
your mother's wish.

00:21:21.896 --> 00:21:25.202
My mother told me I should never
hurt others, no matter what!

00:21:25.235 --> 00:21:26.438
[KYROS]
But you must protect yourself

00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:28.643
from those who would hurt you.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:33.987
[COLOSSEUM MAN 716A]
Do something, Rebecca!

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.193
[GYATS] Rebecca has never
once wounded anybody!

00:21:37.226 --> 00:21:38.864
So far, she's won every fight

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:42.136
just by letting her foes
fall off the side!

00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:45.777
[COLOSSEUM MAN 716B] You only
win by disqualification!

00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:48.883
[COLOSSEUM MAN 716C]
Shed some blood, you weakling!

00:21:50.153 --> 00:21:52.490
You're a huge coward! Boo!

00:21:52.524 --> 00:21:55.597
You should be ashamed
of your victory.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.337
That's no way a gladiator
should claim glory!

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.008
[RANDOM MAN 651E] I hope
you get stabbed this time!

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.279
[RANDOM MAN 651H]
You're a descendant of evil!

00:22:03.312 --> 00:22:05.850
[RANDOM MAN 652B]
You're nothing but garbage!

00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:13.398
Though you've fought
in the Colosseum,

00:22:13.431 --> 00:22:16.037
you still haven't harmed a soul!

00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:20.079
Your hands are still clean.

00:22:20.112 --> 00:22:21.949
They're untainted!

00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:26.491
[KYROS]
Your mother's heart...

00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:31.669
...resides in those
pristine hands.

00:22:37.247 --> 00:22:38.950
[REBECCA]
Mother.

00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:44.261
So I will not allow
for you to stain them

00:22:44.294 --> 00:22:46.765
with this louse's blood!

00:22:47.901 --> 00:22:48.836
[gasps]

00:22:51.642 --> 00:22:53.445
[gasps]

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.925
From now on, you will
live your life peacefully!

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:07.774
[yelling]

00:23:14.755 --> 00:23:16.826
[NARRATOR] Bearing Diamante's
grueling assault,

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:19.363
Kyros' willpower
is left unshaken.

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:20.900
Recollecting the
pain and anguish

00:23:20.934 --> 00:23:23.773
he and Dressrosa suffered from
Doflamingo's despicable acts,

00:23:23.807 --> 00:23:26.011
he finds the fortitude
to press on.

00:23:26.044 --> 00:23:28.516
With renewed strength,
he summons forth a strike

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.820
aimed to liberate
his beloved kingdom.

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.725
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:37.266
"Trueno Bastardo!
Kyros' Furious Strike!"

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:39.905
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
