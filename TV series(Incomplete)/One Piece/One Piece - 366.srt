1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,782
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,251
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,923
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,961
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:53,031
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:56,434
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,836
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,273
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,276
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,513
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,891
Auugh!!

48
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,865
[CHOPPER]
Zoro's falling towards us!

49
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:31,236
[ROBIN] Cien Fleurs!
And Spider Net!

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,345
[USOPP]
You might be huge,

51
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,247
but you're still a zombie!

52
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:45,216
Special Attack: Salt Star!

53
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,021
[USOPP]
Taste good?

54
00:03:57,228 --> 00:03:58,596
[USOPP]
It wasn't...

55
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,199
It wasn't enough!

56
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,234
He's too big!

57
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:17,849
[CHOPPER]
Now, Heavy Gong!

58
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:28,192
[CHOPPER]
Now, Heavy Gong!

59
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:32,630
[USOPP]
Luffy you jerk.

60
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,232
[OARS]
I don't know you.

61
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:37,235
My name's not Luffy.

62
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,375
I'm Master Moria's servant,
the name is Oars.

63
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,246
[LUFFY]
"You're Going Down, Absalom!

64
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:51,149
Nami's Lightning
Attack of Friendship!"

65
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:08,566
[OARS] One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

66
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:15,406
And...

67
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:19,110
[OARS] Dunno those two,
but whatever.

68
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,346
So let's see here.

69
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:24,248
There's that Straw Hat guy.

70
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:29,153
Orange hair lady.
And awesome super-hero.

71
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,591
That's five down
and three to go.

72
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:37,128
Wonder where they're hiding.

73
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,724
[PERONA]
No!

74
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:11,329
Not roaches! Anything but
roaches! Stop it Please!

75
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,475
[USOPP]
Usopp.

76
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:32,383
Ten Ton... Hammer!

77
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:37,822
[ZOMBIE PURPLE THING]
Hey, she's up!

78
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:38,856
[ZOMBIE GREENBEAR]
Are you all right, Mistress?

79
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,323
[PERONA freaking out]
I can't take it anymore!!

80
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,758
Mistress Perona!

81
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,059
Calm down, milady.

82
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:46,998
It's just us,
your loyal servants!

83
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,099
We brought you to safety,

84
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,667
but you've been crying
about roaches in your sleep

85
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,701
for a while now.

86
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:54,205
Where are we?

87
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,773
[ZOMBIE PURPLE THING] We didn't
see any signs of the enemy.

88
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,509
We just found you laying down,
foaming at the mouth.

89
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,546
[ZOMBIE KANGAROO] Who in the
world could've done that to you?

90
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,681
Was it that
nose guy from before?

91
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,017
Why's the mansion falling apart,

92
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,118
what's that rumbling?

93
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,353
Don't tell me those pirates
are on a rampage again.

94
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,354
[ZOMBIE PURPLE THING]
The pirates are still

95
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,423
going on a rampage, I think,

96
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:15,193
but it's actually Oars that's
causing all this destruction.

97
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,527
[PERONA]
You're kidding me!

98
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,570
This is not good.

99
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,640
[ZOMBIE HELMETAPE] I hate to say
this, but from what we heard,

100
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,375
Oars didn't just
wreck the mansion--

101
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,377
He crushed the
Zombie Generals, too.

102
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,446
But they're the
strongest zombies we've got!

103
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,483
So it turns out Moria
can't control Oars after all?

104
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:40,651
[ZOMBIE PURPLE THING]
Well he is really big, so--

105
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,553
[screaming]

106
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:46,224
Oh no, you guys!

107
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,225
He got my bro!

108
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:52,730
I heard a girl.

109
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,567
Wha... What does he want?

110
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:58,269
This might be a
good time to tell you

111
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:00,671
that he kinda stomped
on Doctor Hogback, too.

112
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:02,573
He did what?

113
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,743
[OARS]
Girlie?

114
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,315
I was wrong.

115
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,352
Hey, lady!

116
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,419
I can't take this!

117
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,287
If he's looking for a girl,

118
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,856
who knows what
he'll do if he finds me!

119
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:21,592
Between him and the pirates,
this place is doomed!

120
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:23,261
I'm outta here!

121
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,595
I need you guys
to grab all the treasure

122
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,597
and all the food you can carry!

123
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm gonna steal
their pirate ship and run!

124
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,101
What pirate ship?

125
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,435
The Straw Hats'!

126
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,104
Now before we all get crushed,

127
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,338
let's go!

128
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,607
--As you wish, mistress!
--As you wish, mistress!

129
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,142
[PERONA]
Aw, jeez.

130
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:41,212
[OARS]
Where's da girl?

131
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:44,941
--Mistress Perona!
--Mistress Perona!

132
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,379
[ZOMBIE PRIEST]
You may now kiss the bride.

133
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:51,080
[ABSALOM]
Finally!

134
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,416
I've been waiting long enough!

135
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,125
What? What? No! Stop it!

136
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,229
What're you doing?
Where am I? Cut it out!

137
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:06,896
Damn it!

138
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,231
So she finally woke up, huh?

139
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:09,632
Well, that won't stop me!

140
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,133
[ABSALOM]
Come on, my dear.

141
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,135
I already went through
all the boring stuff!

142
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,171
Just let me kiss you
so we can be husband and wife!

143
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,973
[NAMI]
I said no!

144
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:18,341
[NAMI]
Those aren't even human lips!

145
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,308
And I'm a pirate!

146
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:20,610
I'm into adventure, not romance!

147
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,310
[ABSALOM]
But I'm the Graveyard King!

148
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,412
You'll be the Graveyard Queen!

149
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,081
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

150
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,949
[NAMI]
What does that even mean?

151
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:36,359
[LOLA]
Curse you, Namizo!

152
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:41,664
Lo...

153
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:43,933
Lola! No!

154
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:51,207
[LOLA]
Namizo. You...

155
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,976
[LOLA] How dare you
do this to me, you traitor!

156
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,612
You said Master Ab and I
would make a beautiful couple!

157
00:09:56,646 --> 00:10:00,116
Then I turn around for five
minutes and you're marrying him?

158
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:03,119
You said you were my friend,
but all you wanted was my man!

159
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:06,222
I should've known better
than to trust a thief like you!

160
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,557
Hold on a second Lola,
you've got this all wrong!

161
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,027
I mean, for one, I was
knocked out this entire time.

162
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,361
I don't have a clue what--

163
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:13,729
Is this a wedding dress?

164
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,131
Why am I wearing this?

165
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,165
It's pretty, though.

166
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,300
[LOLA]
Oh, it looks pretty, huh?

167
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,368
How wonderful for you!

168
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,637
[NAMI] This is all
a big misunderstanding!

169
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:23,172
That is enough!

170
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,707
Why don't you just
bury your rotting carcass

171
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,144
in a hole somewhere,
so I can get married already!

172
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,578
If you wanna get married,
marry me!

173
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,147
I would rather die!

174
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:34,250
My poor little Ab,

175
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,419
ignorant of
the terrifying truth.

176
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,488
And what is that
supposed to mean?

177
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:44,360
[LOLA] This so-called woman's
real name is Namizo

178
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,095
and she's really...

179
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,030
A man!

180
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,499
Whaaaaat?!!

181
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:52,668
No, that can't be true!

182
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,404
[NAMI thinking]
Oh, that's right.

183
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,340
I almost forgot I told her that.

184
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:58,674
So how's that?

185
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:02,511
Still wanna get married, Ab?
You into guys now?

186
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,046
And to think,
if she hadn't burst in,

187
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,681
I would've married a man.

188
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,350
I was just a few seconds away

189
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,251
from kissing him
right on the lips!

190
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,287
[ABSALOM]
But wait.

191
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,688
I saw her in the bath.

192
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,023
I know I did.

193
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,198
[ABSALOM]
I made it just in time.

194
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,432
[NAMI]
Looks like this is it.

195
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,038
[NAMI] All right you two,
wait out here for a second.

196
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:30,072
--Okay.
--Okay.

197
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,391
I could've sworn
I heard something.

198
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,126
[USOPP] Hey Nami,
need some help in there?

199
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm fine--
Just watch the door for me!

200
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:53,329
[USOPP]
'Kay.

201
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,299
[ABSALOM]
That was a close one!

202
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,156
That was some bo-yo-yoing

203
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,191
if I've ever seen it.

204
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,627
[LOLA] Get the hell out of here,
you filthy traitor!

205
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,263
[NAMI] I'm telling you,
it's not my fault!

206
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,099
[ABSALOM]
No cutting up my bride, Lola!

207
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,102
[LOLA]
I said, get out of here!

208
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,805
[NAMI thinking]
She keeps missing me.

209
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:37,773
[LOLA]
Namizo.

210
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,375
[NAMI]
What?

211
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:41,210
[LOLA whispering] Run for
it while you still can!

212
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:44,280
I'll hold him off, but I
don't know how long I can last!

213
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,550
I came here to
save you, my friend!

214
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:50,286
[NAMI]
Lola!

215
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,288
[LOLA]
Come here, Master Ab!

216
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,289
[LOLA]
That's right, sweetheart,

217
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,157
if you're looking for
a kiss, then pucker up,

218
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,327
because Lola's got a big
wet one right here for ya!

219
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:01,664
[NAMI]
Lola.

220
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,401
Damn it,
my bride's getting away!

221
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,636
[LOLA] Wrong! Your bride
is right here, baby!

222
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,673
Nice try,
but you can't convince me

223
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,475
that my bride's a man.

224
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,810
Now move. Or suffer!

225
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,364
Lola!

226
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,847
[ABSALOM] You're nothing
but a lowly zombie.

227
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:57,002
How dare you make me waste so
much strength disposing of you!

228
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:48,762
Ah, that's a good girl.

229
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,601
Finally wised up and
stopped running, did you?

230
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,343
You can't hide,
and you can't escape.

231
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:06,447
Because wherever you may go,
I'll hunt you down.

232
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,016
And I can assure you,
you'll never see me coming!

233
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,619
Now Thunder Charge.

234
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,957
How dare you.

235
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,061
I think you and that Ab
Guy make a super cute couple.

236
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,397
You two should totally
hook it up, girlfriend!

237
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:23,797
[LOLA]
Huh?

238
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:24,965
You think?

239
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,970
[LOLA] To be completely honest,
I was beginning to lose hope.

240
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,040
All this time,
no one has ever offered me

241
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:35,042
a single word of encouragement.

242
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,344
You don't know
how much it means.

243
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:39,713
Thank you. Thank you.

244
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,715
[NAMI]
Raise your head up high.

245
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:43,083
It's okay.

246
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,486
You don't have to
thank me for saying that.

247
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,422
We're friends.
My name is Namizo.

248
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,324
But you can call me Nami.

249
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:53,761
[LOLA]
We're friends? Nami!

250
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:57,431
[LOLA]
Namizo.

251
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,832
[NAMI]
What?

252
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:00,668
[LOLA]
Run for it while you still can!

253
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,671
I'll hold him off, but I don't
know how long I can last!

254
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,874
I came here to
save you, my friend!

255
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,610
You can't do that to Lola!

256
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:35,803
Yes, my dear.

257
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,772
Come flying into
your husband's arms.

258
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:41,875
Swing... Arm!

259
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,923
I know this isn't
enough to beat you,

260
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,092
but I'll be damned
if I don't try!

261
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,567
Huh?

262
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,481
Ab-sweetie!

263
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:21,648
Yes, my dear.

264
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:26,487
Come flying into
your husband's arms.

265
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,622
Darling!

266
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,645
Huh?

267
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,324
I don't get it.

268
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:40,661
It hardly seemed to hurt him at
all the last time I did that.

269
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,729
[ZOMBIE PRIEST] It's only
natural, I suppose.

270
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,766
That pervert he was fighting
earlier really wore him out.

271
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,235
He was already
well past his limit.

272
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,937
Well, whatever, right?

273
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,040
I win! Yeah!

274
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,676
I guess I must've hit
his weak spot or something!

275
00:18:58,946 --> 00:19:00,848
[NAMI]
Lola!

276
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,850
Are you okay? Hang in
there!

277
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,119
Thank you!

278
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,622
I don't know what I would've
done if you hadn't shown up.

279
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,858
You don't have to
thank me, Namizo.

280
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,027
We're friends, right?

281
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,598
I owe you an apology, Lola.

282
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,101
When I first saw you, I was
scared and I told you a lie.

283
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,870
It's just that...

284
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,606
I thought if I said I was a
man, you'd leave me alone.

285
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:31,245
You big silly.
It was pretty obvious.

286
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:34,915
I guess so.

287
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:35,883
Wait just a second,

288
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,819
Absalom is completely
helpless right now!

289
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,888
[LOLA]
I'm gonna make you mine, baby!

290
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:55,002
Under here? Hello, Straw Hats?

291
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,572
[LUFFY]
Get back here!

292
00:19:58,605 --> 00:19:59,773
You big, dumb onion!

293
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:03,110
Stop running away from me!

294
00:20:03,143 --> 00:20:05,245
At least give me
a chance to kick your ass!

295
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,582
If you're so tough,
why do you have to run, huh?

296
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,754
Man.

297
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,925
[LUFFY]
Great. Now I lost him.

298
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,263
Gum-Gum... Whip!

299
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:32,773
Don't think I'm
giving up that easy, damn it!

300
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,841
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Whip!

301
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,877
[LUFFY]
One more!

302
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,781
[LUFFY]
Found you!

303
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,017
[LUFFY]
Not so fast!

304
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,690
Whoa.
What was that all about?

305
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,292
I dunno, but wasn't
that Straw Hat Luffy?

306
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:53,560
Are you sure?

307
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,963
I thought he said he was going
to the mansion to beat Moria.

308
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,664
What's he doing
all the way out here?

309
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:00,400
He says he's gonna
kick his ass, then he runs away?

310
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,234
Well, I guess
you're just going to

311
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,971
have to kick
Moria's ass yourselves!

312
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:10,177
[MORIA]
Kushishishi! Kushishishi!

313
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,845
Oh crap, it's him!

314
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:14,414
Now let's be honest
with ourselves here.

315
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,017
Straw Hat says he can
beat me, and you believe him?

316
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,320
Just like that? Kushishishi!

317
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:24,191
[MORIA] Sorry, but that's
not gonna happen.

318
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,226
Not now, not ever.

319
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,395
And if you don't wanna
take my word for it,

320
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:29,262
you can stick around

321
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,231
and watch your
precious little "savior"

322
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,934
get his face pounded
into the ground.

323
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:39,072
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

324
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,083
[OARS]
Anybody in there?

325
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:52,019
Straw Hat, maybe?

326
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:56,056
Orange hair lady? Hero guy?

327
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:58,892
[FRANKY]
Crap.

328
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,128
This guy's gonna be
a real pain in the ass.

329
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,197
[ZORO] He's not just strong,
he's fast as hell for his size.

330
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,366
[SANJI]
What was his name again?

331
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,201
[CHOPPER]
Oh, uh...

332
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:10,070
[ZORO]
Think it was "Roast", right?

333
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,039
[USOPP]
No, not even close.

334
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,808
I think it had an "s"
at the end, didn't it?

335
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:16,877
[CHOPPER]
Hughes?

336
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,046
[USOPP] Eh, I think you're
getting colder, actually.

337
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,047
[SANJI]
"Fours"?

338
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,214
[USOPP]
Hm...

339
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,717
No, wait, that's close, but...

340
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,451
[ROBIN]
It's "Oars."

341
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:26,219
[CREW] That's it!

342
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,888
[BROOK]
Uh...

343
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,724
I'm sorry, but my injuries
are quite terrible...

344
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,459
[FRANKY]
It's fine. We understand.

345
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,428
You can still
move around though, right?

346
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:35,395
[BROOK]
Yes.

347
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,830
[FRANKY] Then move
yourself outta the way.

348
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:37,964
[BROOK]
Of course.

349
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,401
[SANJI]
Hey. Oars!

350
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,736
[OARS]
Huh?

351
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:49,843
[SANJI] If that's really Luffy's
Shadow you've got inside you,

352
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,446
then I probably shouldn't
have to tell you this,

353
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,014
but you should
never underestimate

354
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,850
the strength of your own crew.

355
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,340
[CHOPPER] How can Oars
replicate all of Luffy's moves

356
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,875
with that massive body?

357
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,310
[FRANKY]
He's left us no choice.

358
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:25,112
It's time for you-know-what.

359
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,013
Let's show him the strength
of our powers combined

360
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:28,281
and teach him a lesson.

361
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,484
[CHOPPER] You wanna do
you-know-what right now?

362
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,786
[FRANKY] All right guys!
Let's do this!

363
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,187
Tactic fifteen!

364
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,956
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

365
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,157
"Knock Him Down!!

366
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,526
Special Attack:
Straw Hat Docking?"

367
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,828
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
