00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,449
[NARRATOR] Sanji
and Zoro square off

2
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,185
against the Foxy Pirates
in a Groggy Ring Match

3
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,386
to win Chopper back.

00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,090
with a perfect catch!

The ring is in sight!
Is this it?!

00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,063
[ZORO] It ain't over!
I won't let you score!

8
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,636
I can't let Zoro
bail me out of this!

9
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,671
I'd never hear the end of it!

10
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,545

[ITOMIMIZU] In fact you
might say they're "groggy!"

21
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,712
Now all that's left is to stuff
the ball man in his coffin,

22
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,048
I mean, goal and
it'll be two wins

23
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,583
in a row for
the Foxy Pirates!

24
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:10,757
Hey, let's work
together for ten seconds.

25
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,596
Okay, fine, but no longer.

26
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,074
[ITOMIMIZU] The second
match of our Davy Back Fight

27
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,642
has come to a
dramatic conclusion.

28
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,111
It's another win for
our Groggy Monsters!

29
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,780
And while the Straw Hat
pirates put up a good fight,

30
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,282
they were simply no match
for our reigning champs.

31
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,618
So, with two wins in a
row for the Foxy Pirates

32
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,620
and one adorable new
doctor on the crew,

33
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,690
we must wonder who
Captain Foxy will choose next!

34
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,758
Hey, wait! Look!

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,725
Huh??

36
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,795
[ITOMIMIZU]
They're up! Against all odds,

37
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,831
the Straw Hats are
back on their feet!

38
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,467
Even after a demoralizing
beat down the swordsman

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,269
without his swords
and the savage chef

40
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,072
stand tall in the face
of adversity once again!

41
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,207
Yeah!!!

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,445
You guys! Why you gotta
scare me like that?!

43
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,780
[ITOMIMIZU] The question
is even if they can stand,

44
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,549
do they have enough
strength left to fight?!

45
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,122
[FOXY]
I have a little request.

46
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,523
[GROGGY TEAM]
Huh?

47
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:21,161
One monster burger, please!

48
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,799

Huh?

50
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,235
Now what could that mean?

51
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,572
Huh? Did someone say burgers,
'cause I could go for one.

52
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,407
Is that all you
ever think about?

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,442
[ITOMIMIZU] Uh-oh!
Did you hear that?

54
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,579
Our boss has just ordered
the famous monster burger!

Feh-feh-feh-feh!

00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,469
I get that you guys
are cheaters and all

58
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,705
but you can at least
try to hide it!

59
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,107
Grind em' all up
like some burger meat.

60
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,543
Slice 'em like pickles,
sour or sweet.

00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,346

A head of green lettuce.

63
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,048
[HAMBURG and PICKLES]
And some fine yellow cheese.

Hee-shee-shee-shee...

Smashed between some
big pans, what do I see?

66
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,058
A monster burger
for me to eat!

67
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:24,892
[ITOMIMIZU]
Here it comes!

68
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,760
The most terrifying
triple attack!

69
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,096
The most horrifying
hamburger!

70
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,699
Feh! Feh-feh-feh!

71
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,834
[ITOMIMIZU] It seems hopeless
for the Straw Hats,

72
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,769
but I can't help but think
that the Groggy Monsters

73
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,736
might get handed a red card

74
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,573
for such a flagrant
violation of the rules!

75
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,814
[ITOMIMIZU] But look at that!
What a coincidence!

76
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,315

just happens to be

stretches right now!

catch everything!

81
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,256
Why not?!

82
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,223
'Cause they want
you to get mad,

83
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,460
so you'll butt in and
do something stupid!

84
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:01,762
We just gotta grin
and bear it, Luffy!

All that's left now is to
sit back and enjoy the carnage!

Whatever happens from
here on out, don't blame me!

88
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,308
Anyway, looks like they're
going straight for the ball man.

89
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,310
Unless he acts fast,
he'll be ground and pounded,

90
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:20,513
sliced and diced, trashed and
smashed into a burger patty.

91
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,649
[SANJI] All right, then.

92
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,518
If you want a cooking
battle, you got one.

93

Though I gotta warn you,

94
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,288
I've never cooked
scumbags before,

95
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,456
so I can't say
how it'll turn out.

116
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,235
Not only did they
knock Big Pan down,

117
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,404
they knocked him
right back up, too!

118
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,573
Although Big Pan is
indeed on his feet,

119
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,509
I'm not sure if he has any
idea where he's at right now.

To make matters worse,

Pickles is looking
pretty dazed, himself.

123
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,084
Uh-oh! Now Zoro from the
Straw Hats is charging in!

ulterior motive, perhaps?

Oh, thank you.
Yeah, that last move

176
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,630
was a flagrant foul
if I've ever seen one!

177
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,466
He's outta the game!

178
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,470
[whistle]

179
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,105
[ITOMIMIZU] And that's
the final whistle!

180
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,072
There you have it, folks,

181
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:23,043
the Groggy Ring Match
is officially over!

182
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,113
[cheers]

183
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,816
[fireworks booms]

184
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:32,820
Waaah!!
Yeah! They did it!

185
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:39,059
Yeeeeeaaaahhh!!

186
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,728
Nice work! You're a real pro!

187
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,603
[ITOMIMIZU]
It's the end of an era!

188
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,139
The Groggy Monsters
have finally been dethroned

189
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,474
as the kings of the Ring!

190
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,310
Our new champions, and
winners of the second round

191
00:12:56,343 --> 00:13:00,047
are Zoro and Sanji of
the Straw Hat Pirates!

192
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,416
[CROWD cheers]

193
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,452
Hahahahaha!

194
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,687
What did ya think would happen?

195
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,223
Like our guys would
ever lose to you!

196
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:15,229
Hey, Nami! Hey, Robin!
Was I great? Huh? Was I?

197
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,363
You were just wonderful.

198
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:19,700
You're nothing but a jerk!
Don't scare me like that!

199
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,702
Hey! Hey! Stop!

200
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,204
I'm so glad you followed
my plan after all!

201
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,640
You really think you had
something to do with this?

202
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,210
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

203
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,346
Now, as I'm
sure you all know

204
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,649
at the end of the fight our
winners the Straw Hat Pirates

205
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,451
can claim their
hard-earned prize!

206
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,520
Will they take a
member of Foxy's Crew

207
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,622
or will they take
his Jolly Roger?

208
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,623
Either way,

209
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,758
it's up to their captain
and their captain alone!

210
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,227
Now, drumroll please!

211
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,707
Well the choice
is obvious, isn't it?

212
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,476
Huh? You mean
he's gonna pick me?!

213
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,578
I get it. They want
me, don't they?

214
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,513
They've wanted me
this whole time!

215
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,447
My heart...

216
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,184
My heart isn't ready
to say farewell yet!

217
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,686
Oh no, he's
looking this way!

218
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,322
He's gonna take
me I know it!

219
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,125
I bet it'll be me.
So long, guys.

220
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,760
I don't wanna go!

221
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:22,129
I'll put a smile on
my face for my friends,

222
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,764
even if I'm crying
on the inside.

223
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:27,200
Curses! Why do I have
to be so lovable?!

224
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,274
Come on Luffy, please.

225
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:37,244
Okay! I choose...

226
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,045
[NAMI]
Hold on a sec!

227
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,315
What's up, Nami?

228
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,183
[NAMI] Think about it
their boss is probably

229
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,085
gonna take part in
the next round, right?

230
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,286
Yeah?

231
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,489
[NAMI] We've already seen
what his Slow-Slow Beam can do.

232
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,658
If he fights, we won't
stand a chance in any game,

233
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,526
no matter what the rules are!

234
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,161
So, the answer is obvious.

235
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,363
If Foxy is gonna be our
biggest threat in round 3,

236
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,133
then we should recruit him,
so we have the advantage.

237
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,768
Sure, we'd all like
to get Chopper back

238
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,603
but if we end up
losing the next round,

239
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,305
then they'll probably
take him right back

240
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,206
and our win
would go to waste.

241
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,808
And since his crew
will be dumbstruck

242
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,343
when they lose
their precious boss,

243
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,477
we'll stomp 'em no problem

244
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,313
and claim Chopper
in round three.

245
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,282
Then we're guaranteed to
keep him for good. Get it?

246
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,751
[gasps]

247
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,187
No...! Say it isn't so...!

248
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,123
They're really gonna
take our Captain away?!

249
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,392
But... that's the
Peanut Strategy!

250
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,328
You guys're the
lowest of the low!

251
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,230
Go home, lousy Peanutters!

252
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,666
Are you afraid
to fight us fair?!

253
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,102
[ITOMIMIZU] Although there's
no rule against this strategy,

254
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,204
it certainly seems
a bit underhanded...!

255
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,273
A little cheating is
expected of pirates,

256
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,175
but suddenly taking
a crew's captain away

257
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,643
in the middle of a
game is no different

258
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,245
than running from a fight!

259
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,147
Shame! Shame on
you Straw Hats

260
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,549
and shame on the
heartless devil of a woman

261
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,251
who came up
with this plan!

262
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,487
You're truly a
nefarious navigator, Nami!

263
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,090
How dare you talk
trash about Nami!

264
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,458
I oughta filet you punks!

265
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,460
[ITOMIMIZU] In the long
history of Davy Back Fights,

266
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,161
no one has ever
had the audacity

267
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,597
to pull such a
lousy, no good stunt!

268
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,798
So, What do you say, men?

269
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,533
You can't call a
win against a crew

270
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,270
with no captain a
true victory, can you?

271
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,537
[CROWD]
No!

272
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,573
After swearing on
Davy Jones' name,

273
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,608
is it right to
throw away your honor

274
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,577
as a pirate just
to win a match?!

275
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,811
[CROWD]
No!

276
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,246
[NAMI sobs]

277
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,081
Why are they so mean?!

278
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,150
Well, even if it doesn't
go against the rules,

279
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,086
it does seem to go against some
of their pirate sensibilities.

280
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,590
[CROWD]
Peanuts! Peanuts! Peanuts!

281
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,626
Shut up! You guys
are making me mad.

282
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,395
I'm with
Nami on this one!

283
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,463
I dunno.
I think they're right.

284
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,300
Nami, why don't you
grow a backbone?

285
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,368
You're just making a
big fuss because you lost.

286
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,304
How 'bout you shut up
and deal with it?

287
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,105
Yes, ma'am, we're sorry!

288
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,540
[ITOMIMIZU] Underhanded
witch though she is,

289
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,641
the girl is right!

290
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,710
Monkey D. Luffy is the
captain of the winning team,

291
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:52,580
so it's up to him to decide
how this battle will unfold!

292
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:55,082
That is to say, he's
free to choose anyone

293
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,551
he likes including Foxy himself.

294
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,820
This is it! He's
picking me for sure!

295
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,388
It's not so bad.

296
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,124
I'm sure I'll have
fun sailing with them.

297
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,492
No matter how you slice it,

298
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,728
I'm the only choice
that makes sense.

299
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:10,097
Don't look at me! Please!

300
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,433
I know I'm handsome
but I don't want to go!

301
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,501
So they're gonna
pick me, huh?

302
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,337
I knew these
guys were cool!

303
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,138
Can I leave my friends behind?

304
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,807
How will they go on without me?

305
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,244
Oh no, how is Foxy
ever gonna replace me?

306
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:26,479
Straw Hat you little punk.

307
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,756
[thinking] You're really
gonna choose me, aren't you?

308
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,461
Yes, it's obvious. That was
probably your plan all along.

309
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:44,565
Farewell, Foxy Pirates.
Farewell, my wonderful crew!

310
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:47,067
I'll say goodbye with
a smile on my face.

311
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,769
I owe you that much, at least.

312
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,571
If having such a
charming personality

313
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:54,575
and stunning looks is a sin,
then I accept my punishment!

314
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,744
Those poor Straw Hats
really need a poster boy

315
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:57,545
for their crew.

316
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,079
I can't blame them
for wanting me.

317
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,448
I can't blame
anyone for wanting me!

318
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,585
Say, just a quick thought.
That plan of yours

319
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,654
although it would
give us a big advantage

320
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,090
you realize it would also
make Foxy a part of our crew.

321
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,158
Uh...

322
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,059
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

323
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,733
Oh! Our sweet captain's
heart has been crushed

324
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,535
under the weight of
those cruel words!

325
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,170
It's one thing
to turn him down,

326
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,738
but did they have
to do it like that?

327
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,407
Aww! It's okay.

328
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,776
Even if they don't
want you, we still do!

329
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,312
You're always welcome here!

330
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,713
[FOXY]
Do you mean it?

331
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,215
Nobody makes fun of our
boss and gets away with it!

332
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,451
Yeah, you'll see!
We'll get 'em next round!

333
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,453
We won't let you
down, boss. I promise!

334
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,054
We love you!

335
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,592
[thinking]
You guys. Thank you.

336
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,493
I promise I'll never leave!

337
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,829
You're the only crew for me!

338
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,664
Cut the crap, will ya?

339
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,301
[ITOMIMIZU] Now that
the Straw Hats are done

340
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,503
emotionally abusing our
boss, it's time for them

341
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,372
to make their decision!

342
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:01,541
Come on! Don't leave us
in suspense any longer!

343
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:08,682
Fine. In that case, there's
someone I wanna take back.

344
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:12,352
Shelly!

345
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,754
Huh?

346
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,761
[ITOMIMIZU]
What a turn of events!

347
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,098
The captain of the
Straw Hats has chosen Shelly,

348
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,499
a horse that
Captain Foxy picked up

349
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,534
on a whim after
coming to this island!

350
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,671
Is this pure genius
or just plain idiocy?!

351
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:32,506
Do you have any
idea what you did,

352
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,675
you sorry excuse
for a captain?!

353
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,176
Yeah, of course.

354
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,512
Listen, I know you
didn't like my Foxy plan,

355
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,781
but this is seriously
a bajillion times worse!

356
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:45,052
Okay, but could you stop pulling
my face like that, please?

357
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,520
Did you hear that,
little Choppy?

358
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,589
Looks like you get to
stay with us after all!

359
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,557
Feh-feh-feh!

360
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,626
[NAMI] I know I told
you not to pick Chopper,

361
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:53,560
but I wouldn't
have said

362
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,494
that if I thought
you'd pick some horse!

363
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,397
[LUFFY] Seriously,
stop pulling my face.

364
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,404
[LUFFY]
There you go, Stilts Guy.

365
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:06,073
Now you have your horse
back once and for all.

366
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:07,408
[TONJIT]
How can I thank you?

367
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:09,543
[LUFFY] Seeing you
together is thanks enough.

368
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,046
Hey, your friends
don't look so good.

369
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,482
That last match was a real
doozy you sure they're okay?

370
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:18,485
I blame it all on that
loser with the crazy eyebrows.

371
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,486
Huh?

372
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,455
[TONJIT] They certainly
are lively, aren't they?

373
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:24,457
Hahahaha!

374
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:30,097
This means so much.
Really, thank you.

375
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,700
I told you, it's fine!
Don't sweat it.

376
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:36,070
[laughs]

377
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:37,171
Good girl!

378
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:38,672
[sighs]

379
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:40,608
Well, guess
I can't blame him.

380
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:43,410
Yeah. That is totally
what I would've done.

381
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,312
Let me repay your
kindness by treating you

382
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,047
to some cheese
back at my house.

383
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,682
Not in a million years!

384
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,417
[chuckles]

385
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,219
It's your loss. Suit yourself.

386
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,688
[neighs]

387
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,423
Shelly says "thanks," too.

388
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,625
Heh heh heh...

389
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,493
Just keep off
the stilts, okay?

390
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,295
Are you sure
about this, though?

391
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,330
What about your
little reindeer friend?

392
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,531
Yeah, you jerk!

393
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,800
How do you think he feels
being left with those weirdoes?

394
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,436

395
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,007
Luffy.

396
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,477
Poor little guy.

397
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,512
Chopper, I'm sorry.

398
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,646
I know this is hard on you

399
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,182
but no matter what, I promise
we'll win the next game

400
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:25,486
and get you back! So hang
on a little longer, okay?

401
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,154
I know you can take it.

402
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:28,154
[sniiiiff]

403
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,224
After all, you're a man, right?

404
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,562
You bet I am!

406

That's our Chopper.

407
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:42,269
Leave it to me little pal,
you'll be just fine.

408
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,705
If you're Chopper's
last hope. He's screwed.

409
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:45,706
Eh-heh!

410
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,142
I wonder what the
next game is going to be.

411
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,611
Hmph! Whatever it is,
I'm ready for it.

412
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,712
Hahahaha...!

413
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,115
We're gonna have Chopper
back on the crew in no time!
