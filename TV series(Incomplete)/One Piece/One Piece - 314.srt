1
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,690
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:40,627
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,864
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:49,236
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,738
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,106
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,310
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,512
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,082
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,152
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,622
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,927
[FRANKY] A long time ago,

13
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,129
I decided that
I was done building ships

14
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,230
for the rest of my life.

15
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,000
And yet I couldn't help
but follow in the footsteps

16
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,636
of my old master,
and soon enough,

17
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,771
I found myself designing a ship.

18
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,545
Now, my hope is to use
that special wood to build it.

19
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,247
To put all my heart
into one last ship.

20
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,151
A ship of dreams
that can sail across any sea!

21
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,629
[FRANKY] I've had
the blueprints for ages.

22
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,831
Now I finally have the wood.

23
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,200
All that's left is to make it.

24
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,437
So what I'm saying here

25
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:01,608
is it would be my honor
if you'd take my ship

26
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,677
and sail the world!

27
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,488
What?

28
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,923
Damn, he's fast!

29
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,058
Rise and shine!

30
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,163
No!

31
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,767
Ow! That hurt! Ow!

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,001
What happened?

33
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,637
Why would one little punch
hurt you so much?

34
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,105
You're made of rubber!

35
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,242
It's because there is no
defense against a fist of love.

36
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,210
You've been getting in
a lot of trouble lately,

37
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,780
haven't you, Luffy?

38
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,483
G-G-G-Grandpa?

39
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,391
[ALL] What?

40
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:53,360
[CHOPPER]
A Marine Vice Admiral is your...

41
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,498
[LUFFY] The Strongest Family?

42
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,799
Luffy's Father Revealed!

43
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,346
It's been a while.

44
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,285
I think you owe me
an apology, boy.

45
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,320
You've been up to no good!

46
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,124
Garp never told us
he had a grandson!

47
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,726
I haven't heard a word
about his family at all!

48
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,362
Garp?

49
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,766
But isn't that the
name of the Navy hero

50
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,568
that fought against Gold Roger?

51
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,873
Luffy, is this Navy guy
really your grandpa?

52
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,008
[LUFFY] Sure is.

53
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,410
No matter what,
don't try to fight him!

54
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,019
He'll kill you,

55
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,621
just like he almost
killed me over and over

56
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,121
when I was little.

57
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,602
[GARP] Now now, you're
gonna give them the wrong idea!

58
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,338
Although I admit,

59
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,707
I did throw you into
a ravine that one time.

60
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,909
[LUFFY screaming]

61
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,712
And I left you in the
jungle a few times, too.

62
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,914
[LUFFY screaming]

63
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,216
And sure,
there were those times

64
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,118
I sent you sailing
on those balloons.

65
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,887
[LUFFY screaming]

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,222
But I didn't
do it to kill you--

67
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,390
I did it to make you a man!

68
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,267
I see.

69
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,403
So this is where all of
Luffy's endurance comes from.

70
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,471
This is why everything
rolls off of him.

71
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,974
[GARP] When I left you and Ace
with my friend for training,

72
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,576
I thought everything
would work out fine.

73
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,050
But I turn my back,
and you end up like this.

74
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,819
I wanted to make you
into a Navy man,

75
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,953
you stinkin' ingrate!

76
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,755
How the heck did
you become a criminal?

77
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,124
I told you a million times
I wanted to be a pirate!

78
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,926
It's not my fault
you wouldn't listen!

79
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,528
This is all that
damned redhead's fault!

80
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,730
The fool!

81
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,566
I--I wouldn't even be
alive if it wasn't for Shanks!

82
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,700
Shut up!

83
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,370
"Shut up", huh?

84
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,105
Is that any way to
speak to your Grandpa?

85
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,906
All right! I'm sorry!

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,142
We're all done for!

87
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,377
Our Captain's been
captured by the Marines!

88
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,179
Luffy!

89
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,714
[LUFFY] Help! No!

90
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,682
This is bad.

91
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,216
If we try to help Luffy,

92
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,085
then all those Marines outside
are gonna rush in and attack us.

93
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,857
They're asleep?!

94
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,959
[FRANKY] Uh, so wait...

95
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,627
What're we supposed to do here?

96
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,663
I've never been in a
situation like this before.

97
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,302
Oh no,
did I fall asleep again?

98
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,544
[GARP] Wake up and
take your lecture like a man!

99
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,980
Don't you dare doze off on me
when I'm yelling at you!

100
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,483
[punching noises,
LUFFY screaming]

101
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,819
[GARP] If you don't show
your Grandpa some respect,

102
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,088
I'll have to beat it outta you!

103
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,692
[CHOPPER, NAMI, SANJI] I think
I'm gonna stay out of this one.

104
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,797
[YOKOZUNA] Gero?

105
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,766
[USOPP] Are you kidding me?

106
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,533
That's his grandfather?

107
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,503
Well, it's no wonder Luffy
never talked about his family.

108
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,839
This is crazy!

109
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,339
Gero.

110
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,346
Speaking of that
red-headed pirate friend

111
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,115
of yours, do you
have any clue what kind

112
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:36,750
of dangerous business
he's involved in?

113
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,118
[LUFFY] No.

114
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:40,454
I haven't heard anything
about Shanks in a long time.

115
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,455
Is he okay?

116
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,656
What's he up to?

117
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,690
"Is he okay"?

118
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,125
Of course!

119
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,727
There's as many
pirates out there

120
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,596
as there are stars in the sky,

121
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,531
but that redhead's
one of the brightest;

122
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,567
he's in the same class
as Whitebeard, even.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,370
There're only four
pirates as powerful as that,

124
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:59,006
and they rule over the
second half of the Grand Line,

125
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,207
like kings!

126
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,376
They're the Four Emperors.

127
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,212
The Seven Warlords
and us folks at the Navy

128
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:06,414
have allied against them.

129
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:10,217
The idea is to
create a balance of power.

130
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,919
If any one of
these three forces

131
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,287
grew stronger than the others,

132
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,655
then the peace
we work so hard to protect

133
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,557
would come crumbling down.

134
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:23,964
I don't really get it,
but I'm glad he's okay.

135
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,666
Man, brings back memories, huh?

136
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,671
[SHANKS]
I'll leave this hat to you.

137
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,140
It means more to me
than anything in the world,

138
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,842
so you better
take good care of it.

139
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,209
You hear me?

140
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,685
[SHANKS] I want you to bring
this hat back to me someday,

141
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,321
in good condition.

142
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,223
[SHANKS] And only once
you've become a great pirate.

143
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,159
That's our promise, Luffy.

144
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,633
Luffy has connections
to "Red-Haired" Shanks?

145
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,002
That's where he got
his straw hat from.

146
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,538
Shanks asked him
to take care of it.

147
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:08,141
I had no idea he was
such an important guy, though.

148
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,280
[MICHAEL] It's over here, Zoro!

149
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,916
[ZORO] Damn it! We're too late!

150
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,285
[HOICHAEL] Anyway,
good luck with the Navy!

151
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,055
And sorry again.

152
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,689
We shouldn't have
tried to mug you!

153
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,857
That was a mistake!

154
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,958
Ah, don't worry about it--

155
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,827
Thanks for showing
me the way here!

156
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,194
See ya!

157
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:32,767
What's going on out there?

158
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,169
[chaotic noise outside]

159
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,403
It's the Pirate Hunter.

160
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,972
He seems to be going
on some sort of rampage.

161
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,043
Ah. He's from Luffy's crew, huh?

162
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,711
He looks pretty tough.

163
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,646
Heh. Go ahead, you two.

164
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,680
Give him hell.

165
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:47,714
Sir!

166
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,492
[ZORO] Kukri knives, huh?

167
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,261
Interesting choice of
a weapon you've got there.

168
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,064
Zoro, stop!

169
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,866
It's okay!
We don't need to fight--!

170
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,903
Hey, what was
that for, you jerk?

171
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,136
Shave!

172
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,772
That technique...

173
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,420
Are you okay?

174
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,454
What happened?

175
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,990
[laughing]

176
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,493
Boys, you're no match at all!

177
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,862
You're as tough
as I thought you'd be.

178
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,698
That was a nice one.
Heheh!

179
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,599
Anyway, I give!

180
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,005
Hi, Luffy. Hi, Zoro.

181
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,774
[BOY]
It's been a while.

182
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,843
Do you know who I am?

183
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,078
Uh, no?

184
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,981
Look, it's me! It's Coby!

185
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,749
You mean you don't remember me?

186
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,584
Coby, huh?

187
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,888
[COBY] Do you think--

188
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,124
Do you think I could
ever join the Marines?

189
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:04,892
[LUFFY] Marines?

190
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,426
[COBY] Yes!

191
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,595
Catching bad guys is the only
thing I've ever wanted to do!

192
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,432
It's been my dream
since I was a child!

193
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,201
Luffy and I haven't known each
other for years or anything,

194
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,604
but I'd still
consider him a friend.

195
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,804
Wouldn't you say?

196
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,239
Of course.

197
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,975
We may have to part ways,
but we'll always be friends.

198
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,643
I can never thank you enough!

199
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,047
You've done more for me
than anyone ever has!

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,215
We'll meet again, Coby.

201
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,350
Someday!

202
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,184
Bye, Luffy.

203
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,620
Hope to see
you again someday!

204
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:35,422
All hands. Salute!

205
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,725
See ya!

206
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,128
[LUFFY] Coby, huh?

207
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,165
Well, I do have
a friend named Coby,

208
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,968
but the Coby I know is
a whole lot smaller than you.

209
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,003
Sorry.

210
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,971
Nope, that's the right Coby.

211
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,140
The crybaby good-for-nothing
Coby from before!

212
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,544
No way!

213
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,079
Yeah, that's him.

214
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,747
But why's he on the Grand Line?

215
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,949
To be honest,

216
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,951
I'm not a commissioned
Navy officer yet,

217
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,552
but when I heard
you guys were in the area,

218
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,522
I had to stop by and say hello
while I still had the chance!

219
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:11,424
[LUFFY freaking out]

220
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,994
[COBY] If it wasn't for you two,

221
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,429
we wouldn't be
where we are today!

222
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,134
Well, I wouldn't
go quite that far.

223
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,602
A lot of stuff happened,
but long story short,

224
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,806
we ended up being trained
by Vice-Admiral Garp himself.

225
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,008
That musta been hard work!

226
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,721
Man. But you grew
so much from before,

227
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,356
I didn't even recognize you!

228
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,590
It's crazy!

229
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:47,260
The Coby I remember was
a pudgy little dorky guy.

230
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,765
[COBY] I'm sure you're worn out
after all that happened.

231
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,700
Sorry to bother you.

232
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:53,934
[LUFFY] Nah, it's fine.

233
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,702
I haven't seen you in ages!

234
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,771
We gotta celebrate!

235
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,073
[BLONDE GUY]
Hey, you bastards!

236
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,807
Hold on a second!

237
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,045
You didn't recognize
me at all, huh?

238
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:05,880
Who the hell are you?

239
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,581
It's me!

240
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,550
See? Me!

241
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,817
[LUFFY] No, I don't see.

242
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,486
Just tell me.

243
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,554
Get a clue, guys.

244
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,758
It's Helmeppo!

245
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,895
Captain Morgan's son, Helmeppo.

246
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,163
Surely you remember now!

247
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,398
[HELMEPPO] I had you tied up.

248
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,267
You were almost executed
because of me, Zoro!

249
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,738
You couldn't possibly
forget that, could you?

250
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,106
[laughs nervously]

251
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,106
[HELMEPPO] Well, there.

252
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,709
Now we all know who I am, right?

253
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,912
Really, guys.

254
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,915
Stop giving me such a hard time.

255
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,152
[HELMEPPO] Now, now.
No one likes a bully.

256
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,822
[HELMEPPO] Roronoa Zoro, you
seem to be handling this well.

257
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,791
Don't you agree?

258
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:51,925
[RIKA] No! Stop!

259
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,661
I worked so hard!

260
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:54,995
I made empty threats.

261
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,031
I was always
talking about my daddy.

262
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:01,568
Oh. That guy.

263
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:04,037
[HELMEPPO]
What do ya' mean "that guy"?

264
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:05,839
Yeah, right.

265
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,309
You sucked. No wonder I forgot.

266
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,779
I wanted to forgive
them, but I just can't.

267
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,314
I'm so sorry, Coby!

268
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:17,751
You just have to accept the
past and move on, Helmeppo.

269
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,019
He still sucks.

270
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,954
Looks like it.

271
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,089
Hey Luffy.

272
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,491
I know that you
and I are enemies now.

273
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,727
But are we still, uh--

274
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,731
Of course.
We're still friends.

275
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:54,621
Now, I've got a
job for you boys.

276
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,523
Sir!

277
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,092
This wall? Fix it!

278
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,060
[MARINES] What?

279
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,128
[MARINE 313A] Are you kidding?

280
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,529
If you were gonna
have us fix it,

281
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,331
why'd you break it
in the first place?

282
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,832
Because walking through a door

283
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,334
doesn't make
much of an impression.

284
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,969
The only impression
you're making here

285
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,271
is a bad one!

286
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:12,039
Okay, we'll fix the wall,
but it's your fault,

287
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,207
so you gotta help us!

288
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,975
What?

289
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,276
All right.

290
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:24,351
So this grandpa of yours
is really famous.

291
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:25,285
Beats me.

292
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,088
I never really asked him
about his job.

293
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,026
By the way, Luffy,

294
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,362
I heard you met
your old man a while back.

295
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,964
Huh? My dad?

296
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,732
No, I don't think so.

297
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,201
I didn't even think I had a dad.

298
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,841
That's a shame.

299
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,710
I thought he'd
introduce himself to you!

300
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:54,448
From what I hear, he saw
you off back at Loguetown.

301
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,016
[ZORO] Loguetown.

302
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,189
So that's the island
where Loguetown is located.

303
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,890
[LUFFY] That's it, huh?

304
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,492
That's the island
where Gold Roger

305
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,796
was born and then
executed, right?

306
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,596
Okay.

307
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,565
So you did remember.

308
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,702
Where the King of the
Pirates met his fate.

309
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:15,836
This place is known as

310
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,338
the City of the
Beginning and the End.

311
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,586
Hey! What gives?

312
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,889
[crazed laughter]

313
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,491
[BUGGY] To all of my followers!

314
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:40,093
Hundreds of billions
of them around the world!

315
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:44,098
We will now super flashily
begin the public execution!

316
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,166
[BUGGY] You're trapped,
Monkey D. Luffy!

317
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,635
You can't move
so much as an inch!

318
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,471
Tell me, Straw Hat,
feel honored?

319
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,741
You'll die in the same place
as the King of the Pirates!

320
00:17:54,775 --> 00:18:04,784
[maniacal laughter]

321
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,188
You've got quite a big
audience here today, Straw Hat.

322
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:11,291
[BUGGY] You wanna say
a few words before you die?

323
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:14,662
Oh, cat got your tongue?

324
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:15,662
That's all right.

325
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,264
Stay quiet, or say a few words.

326
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,900
It doesn't matter,
you're still gonna die!

327
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,803
[thunder]

328
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,004
Listen!

329
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,074
I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

330
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:31,178
[screaming]

331
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,579
[ZORO] Out of our way!

332
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,154
[crazed laughter]

333
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,056
Not even the great
Zoro can stop me now!

334
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,925
There's nothing you two can do!

335
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,828
It's the end for your captain!

336
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,296
Bastard!

337
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:55,669
[ZORO] If I can just
cut down the platform...

338
00:18:55,703 --> 00:19:01,174
[maniacal laughter]

339
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,176
[LUFFY] Zoro! Sanji!

340
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,912
--C'mon Nami! Hurry up!
--[LUFFY] Usopp! Nami!

341
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:05,846
[NAMI] It's heavy!

342
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,147
[LUFFY] Sorry...

343
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,017
But... I'm dead.

344
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,244
[laughing]

345
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,714
I'm still alive!
That's nice!

346
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,754
The Straw Hat gang
is getting away!

347
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:48,923
[MARINE B] Go after them!

348
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,523
[MARINE C] Capture them!

349
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,426
[SANJI]
I remember what happened,

350
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,061
but I sure don't
remember Luffy's father.

351
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,065
Could you
give me a hint here?

352
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,833
What's Dad like?

353
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,935
I'd like to know, myself.

354
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,104
I can't imagine it.

355
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:08,842
[GARP] The name of your
father is Monkey D. Dragon.

356
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,710
The revolutionary.

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,351
Your luck's run out.

358
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,990
[DRAGON] I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

359
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:25,692
It's you!

360
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,237
Dragon, huh?

361
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,982
Th--That Dragon?

362
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,284
The revolutionary has a son?

363
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,987
Even though he's famous,
Luffy didn't know.

364
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,054
Wait...

365
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,523
Dragon is
Vice-Admiral Garp's son?

366
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,793
What kinda crazy,
messed up family have they got?

367
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:00,995
Come to think of it,

368
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,163
I never heard Dragon's
full name before!

369
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,001
What's the deal, you guys?

370
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,635
Why's everyone
freaking out so much?

371
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:09,670
Are you kidding?

372
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:10,804
You're trying to tell me

373
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,606
you've never heard
of Dragon before?

374
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,643
He's a dangerous man,
like really dangerous!

375
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,786
Gero?

376
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,989
Um, Robin?

377
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:32,426
I'm not exactly sure how
I should explain this one.

378
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,429
Pirates like us are
enemies with the Navy,

379
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,733
but we don't usually
attack them on our own.

380
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,200
But there is one group

381
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,936
that is directly
opposing the authority

382
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,904
of the World Government.

383
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,605
The Revolutionary Army.

384
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,443
And the man at the head
of that group is Dragon.

385
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,978
[ROBIN] By now,
his ideology has spread

386
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:54,181
to many nations,
causing worldwide rebellion.

387
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,916
The Government's hold
has already collapsed

388
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:58,185
in a number of regions.

389
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,420
Naturally, the
Government is furious.

390
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,956
They've labeled Dragon as
the "World's Worst Criminal"

391
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,658
and will stop
at absolutely nothing

392
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,827
to hunt him down.

393
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,161
The problem is
that no one knows

394
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,031
a single thing about him.

395
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,532
He's very mysterious.

396
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:13,934
And yet...

397
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,569
And yet what?

398
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:28,482
[GARP]
Ah, that was a mistake, huh?

399
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,151
I probably shouldn't
have said all that stuff.

400
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:41,862
[laughing]

401
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,630
[GARP] I take it all back.

402
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,432
Forget it, okay?

403
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:55,041
[ALL] What?

404
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,295
[LUFFY] Aw, you're
leaving already, Coby?

405
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,598
At least have some food!
It's a party!

406
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,933
[COBY] We may be friends,
but we're still enemies.

407
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,103
I have to draw
the line somewhere.

408
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,672
Still, I'm glad I got
to see you today.

409
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:27,341
I look forward to meeting you
again in the New World.

410
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,176
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

411
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,011
Its Name is the New World!

412
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:33,380
The Fate of the Grand Line!

413
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,283
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
