1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,241
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,710
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:45,381
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:50,420
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,489
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:57,060
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,329
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,732
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,702
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,172
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,213
[PERONA]
It's him.

48
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:21,117
One of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

49
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,720
The Tyrant, Bartholomew Kuma!

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,222
If you could take a vacation,

51
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:30,426
Where is it you'd like to go?

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,095
[PERONA]
Stop screwing around!

53
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,398
I admit I was taken aback
when I realized who you were.

54
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,533
But I've got nothing to fear.

55
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,703
[PERONA]
Negative Ghost!

56
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:45,041
And Special Hollow!

57
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:52,548
[KUMA] Before you interrupted
with all that yelling,

58
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:56,119
I was simply going to
ask you where Moria is.

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,488
Where did she go?

60
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,657
You're the Cat Burglar,
aren't you?

61
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,659
One of the Straw Hat Pirates?

62
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,562
[NAMI thinking]
No way!

63
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:09,065
He just suddenly
appeared up there!

64
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,433
Did he teleport?

65
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,237
What does he want with Luffy?

66
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,638
I've got to go warn him.

67
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:21,244
Gotcha, Moria! You're mine!

68
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,851
What? I've been
chasing his shadow?!

69
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,187
Aw, dammit!

70
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:33,423
He tricked me!

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,461
"Oars + Moria!

72
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:41,531
The Most Heinous Combination
of Brains and Brawn"!

73
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:47,437
[LUFFY]
Stupid jerk!

74
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,839
When did he even have time to
switch places with his shadow?

75
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,119
Hey! Hold on!

76
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:04,854
Don't ignore me,
you dumb shadow!

77
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,656
No! Come back!

78
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,293
Or at least tell me
where the hell I am!

79
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,695
Hey!!

80
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,868
Aw, man, this sucks.

81
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,803
Everybody's countin'
on me to beat Moria

82
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,373
and get their
shadows back for them.

83
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,308
And I've gotta do it by sunrise.

84
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,476
Wait.

85
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,644
Why do we need
our shadows back by then?

86
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,653
Auuuugh!!

87
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,589
Oh, yeah!
The sun's gonna melt us.

88
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:43,393
We're gonna be dust if I can't
work this out before morning.

89
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,927
It doesn't look
like there's much time.

90
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:47,263
I gotta get moving quick.

91
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,233
This is bad. I've been
gone too long already.

92
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,002
What the hell...

93
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,837
How did things
turn out like this?

94
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:57,774
I guess I better
follow Moria's shadow

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,876
and just hope it's
going the right way.

96
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,462
Zoro!

97
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,296
We're just trying
to buy enough time

98
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:21,864
for Luffy to
get our shadows back!

99
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,900
It's not like
we need to defeat him!

100
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,437
I'm just finishing
the fight he started,

101
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,906
and I've got this new sword.

102
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,443
I couldn't imagine a better time
to see what it's capable of.

103
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,545
[USOPP]
Oh, c'mon! Don't be stupid!

104
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,712
[ZORO]
Oars!

105
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,484
You want a real fight?

106
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,286
Looks like you found one.

107
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,921
Let's see what you've got.

108
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,656
He's gonna fight
him on his own?

109
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:55,998
Give it a rest!

110
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,267
You're practically
begging to get flattened!

111
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:00,603
Can't you try out
that sword some other time?

112
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,906
I didn't notice it earlier,

113
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:06,742
but Shusui has a lot more
heft to it than my Yubashiri.

114
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,778
Never used a black blade before.

115
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:11,681
Zoro! Get out of the way!

116
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:13,950
[ZORO]
But with this weight...

117
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,754
Awesome.

118
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,823
He deflected the
punch with his sword!

119
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,593
[ZORO]
Three Sword Style:

120
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,995
One Hundred and Eight
Caliber Phoenix!

121
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,599
It's enormous!

122
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:34,604
Dammit! He almost had him!

123
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,305
I'm amazed he could dodge that.

124
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,773
That was stronger
than I expected.

125
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,275
The blade absorbed the slashes

126
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:41,277
of the other
two swords into one.

127
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,012
It's impressive,

128
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,715
but it still moves a
little too slow for my liking.

129
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,483
That just means
I've got some work to do

130
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,785
before I can fully master it.

131
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,788
The increase in
power sure is nice, though.

132
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,323
Let's just hope
I live long enough

133
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,992
to bring it under control.

134
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,401
You gave me one hell
of a sword, Samurai Ryuma.

135
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:09,805
You little guys are fast.

136
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,508
You coulda put
out my eye with that.

137
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,844
You runty bastard!

138
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:19,415
[OARS] I'm gonna
grind you down to goo!

139
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:24,554
[OARS]
I'll crush you!

140
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,888
Zoro!

141
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,757
Holy crap, is he alright?

142
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:34,030
[OARS]
Get back here!

143
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,098
[ZORO] I can't spend
the entire fight dodging him.

144
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,867
Why's he gotta be so big?

145
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:52,782
He's going down!

146
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,116
Three Sword Style:

147
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,518
One Hundred and Eight...

148
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,887
[OARS]
Crushin' time!

149
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:03,893
[CHOPPER]
Zoro!

150
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:07,563
That was close.

151
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,936
Let's see if
there's anything left.

152
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,705
Huh?

153
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:20,409
I didn't crush him?
How'd he get away?

154
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:24,080
Where is he?
I can't see with all the dust.

155
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,150
Three Sword Style:

156
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,953
One Hundred and Eight
Caliber Phoenix!

157
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,458
[OARS]
That was close.

158
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,425
Dammit.

159
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:38,995
Dodged me again, huh?
You're a real pain.

160
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,464
This pipsqueak
doesn't know when to quit.

161
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,798
He just keeps comin'.

162
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,433
Come on, Zoro! Don't push it!

163
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,835
You're just making things worse!

164
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,070
Even if you do somehow
miraculously take him down,

165
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:49,238
what's the point?

166
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,008
Luffy's shadow is the only
one we'll get back from him!

167
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,609
We don't even
have the slightest idea

168
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,144
where yours and Sanji's are!

169
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,079
If we really want to
get our shadows back,

170
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,416
we just need to wait here
until Luffy takes care of it!

171
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,751
There's no point
killing yourself

172
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,686
trying to take down
an undead giant!

173
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,121
All we gotta do
is believe in Luffy

174
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,623
and try to keep this
guy busy for a while!

175
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:10,092
[ZORO] I've got
plenty of faith in Luffy.

176
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,929
But I'm also aware of
Luffy's one major weakness.

177
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,798
It's trickery.

178
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,700
They've got an invisible man,

179
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,602
a girl who controls ghosts,

180
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,103
and a shadow master.

181
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,205
Trickery is the name
of the game on this island

182
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,608
and they're all
professionals at it.

183
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,842
It's safe to say
that none of them

184
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,979
is planning on
giving Luffy a fair fight.

185
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,814
I'm afraid that I must agree.

186
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,215
Yeah.

187
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,719
[ZORO] If they manage to
stall Luffy and the sun rises,

188
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,789
then we're screwed.
Him, me and the cook.

189
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,824
We'll melt until
we're nothing but ash.

190
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,894
Maybe we can't save ourselves,

191
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,496
but if we can get
Luffy his shadow back

192
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,899
he can lay this
damn island to waste.

193
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,667
Looks like we've
got maybe thirty minutes

194
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,569
before sunrise.

195
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,005
On the plus side,
that's some thick fog.

196
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:59,241
The sun's gonna have a hard
time getting through that.

197
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,976
So we're that close to dawn.

198
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,913
We should count our
blessings we've got this fog.

199
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,048
Can't say it's
much comfort, though.

200
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,818
The reality of melting's
starting to sink in for me.

201
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,831
How long have they
been standing there?

202
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:27,570
What the hell?

203
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,840
[ZORO]
What is this, an earthquake?

204
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,043
What's going on?

205
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:36,112
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369A] The ship's
not anchored, remember?

206
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:38,948
We're caught in another bad
current like the last one!

207
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:42,852
Hey! The sky! Look up!

208
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,621
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369B]
The sun's starting to come out!

209
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:46,889
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369C]
And the fog!

210
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,959
Why's the fog clearing up?
What's happening?

211
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,127
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369D]
Please tell me I'm wrong,

212
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:54,864
but do you think we could've
left the Florian Triangle?

213
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:55,865
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369D]
We have!

214
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,967
And it's all because
Oars was screwing around

215
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,702
with the helm earlier!

216
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:01,937
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 369E] You're
right, it's all his fault!

217
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,598
Why the hell'd he
have to go and do that?

218
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,564
[WHITE SHIRT]] I'm tellin'
ya, somethin's wrong here!

219
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,832
Just look at the sky!

220
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,500
It's completely clearin' up!

221
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,602
[STRIPED SHIRT]
Oh, no, we're doomed!

222
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,170
It's all over!

223
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,005
Why's it gotta end this way?

224
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,174
[WHITE SHIRT]
Hey, you can't just give up!

225
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,009
You wanna die on
your hands and knees?

226
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,545
I'm not goin' out
without a fight!

227
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,848
Hey! Look up there!

228
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,082
It's Moria's shadow!

229
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,251
And it's headed
towards the mansion!

230
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,086
[STRIPED SHIRT] Is that
supposed to mean somethin'?

231
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,021
[WHITE SHIRT]
Idiot! Think about it!

232
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,923
Straw Hat's
not with him anywhere.

233
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,960
And his shadow's still
trapped inside that big guy!

234
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,028
Meaning he's gotta
be wandering around here

235
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,396
somewhere on his own.

236
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,365
[STRIPED SHIRT]
Aha! Now I get ya!

237
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,266
[WHITE SHIRT]
Alright!

238
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,534
Let's go tell the
captain and his crew!

239
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,537
We'll do everything we can to
help Straw Hat before dawn.

240
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,038
[STRIPED SHIRT]
Right! Good idea!

241
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,878
Master Moria!
We've got some serious trouble!

242
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,479
Thriller Bark
has come unmoored again!

243
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,082
We're on the move
and we've broken out of the fog!

244
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,984
And it's all Oars' fault!

245
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,893
[BAO, GYORO, NIN]
Master Moria!

246
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,262
So what,
stop screaming! Who cares!

247
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,264
It's not the end
of the world, you idiots.

248
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,565
We're pirates, aren't we?

249
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,902
The whole ocean is our home, no
matter where our ship ends up.

250
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,238
Yeah, but uh...

251
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,640
Time to shut your mouths.

252
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,309
I have the unexpected
pleasure of an important guest

253
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,244
and you're
rudely interrupting it.

254
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,146
So,

255
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,581
"Tyrant" Kuma.

256
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,150
What can I do for the only
member of the Seven Warlords

257
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,653
who chooses to obey
the government like a dog?

258
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,104
So, "Tyrant" Kuma.

259
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,640
What can I do for the only
member of the Seven Warlords

260
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,976
who obeys the
government like a dog?

261
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,011
The government considers
you a valued weapon

262
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,379
in their arsenal of goons,

263
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,448
but I can't say
I share their admiration.

264
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,683
I don't know
what you're plotting

265
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,718
but I'm sure
that I won't like it.

266
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,386
If you were to take a vacation,

267
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,521
where would you want to go?

268
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,623
Come now,
do I look like a fool?

269
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:21,126
I'm fully cognizant of the
powers you possess, alright?

270
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:24,396
Get to the point, did you
come here to fight me or what?

271
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,698
Speak your business.

272
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,634
Why have you gone to the
trouble of seeking me out?

273
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,070
I'm here to deliver a report.

274
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,538
[MORIA]
Well, let's hear it.

275
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,472
[KUMA]
As you know,

276
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,374
Crocodile has been
removed from his post

277
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,343
as one of the Seven Warlords.

278
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,078
It's been decided
who will replace him.

279
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,312
[MORIA]
Kushishi!

280
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,014
Why didn't you say so?

281
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,316
And who have they
chosen as his successor?

282
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,353
There are hoards of pirates
that would kill for the job.

283
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,421
You might not
have even heard of him.

284
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,657
His name is Marshall D. Teach.

285
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,326
Also commonly known
by the name of Blackbeard.

286
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,694
Blackbeard, huh?

287
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,596
You're right, I don't know him.

288
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,565
He was a member
of Whitebeard's fleet,

289
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,333
second division.

290
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,269
He's only recently
proven his abilities

291
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,004
that led to his appointment.

292
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,274
Black Vortex!

293
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,745
St. Elmo's Fire!

294
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,689
Darkness take you!

295
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,025
Great Flame Commandment!

296
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,266
Flame Emperor!

297
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,721
I suppose the news hasn't
reached these foggy waters yet,

298
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,790
but his powers have raised
a great deal of commotion

299
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,391
throughout the world.

300
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,326
[MORIA]
Have they?

301
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,795
What was the
original bounty on his head?

302
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,096
Zero.

303
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,499
[MORIA] How impressive.
A total unknown.

304
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:08,734
I'm surprised
that the government

305
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,470
approved him for the job.
Kushishi!

306
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,772
They're probably happy
they managed to find someone

307
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,741
to fill the spot so quickly.

308
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,276
I expect that
this is supposed to

309
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,312
restore the balance of
power or whatever, right?

310
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,481
Perhaps.

311
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,849
But if I were to place a bet,

312
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,251
I would say
it's the exact opposite.

313
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,354
Nevermind that, though.

314
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,155
There is an issue
we must discuss.

315
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,158
Something the world
government is anxious about.

316
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,761
After the catastrophic
events at Enies Lobby,

317
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:36,829
they're more concerned than ever

318
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,665
about the movements of
the Straw Hat Pirate Crew.

319
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,600
If they're following
the Log from Water 7,

320
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,502
headed toward Fishman Island,

321
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,206
there is a high probability that
they will find their way here.

322
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,274
If that's the case,
then I'm sure you can understand

323
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,610
what the World Government
is worried about.

324
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,514
It's the balance of power.

325
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,349
The government is
concerned the Straw Hats

326
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,852
will take out another
one of the Seven Warlords.

327
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,221
That would be most unfortunate.

328
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,391
You better be joking.

329
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,493
Do they think
I'm not up to the job?

330
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,896
I've never been
so insulted in my life!

331
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,400
They sent you here to protect me
against those pathetic nobodies?

332
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,402
[KUMA] If you think my
assistance could benefit you,

333
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,470
I'd be happy to
help if you but ask.

334
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,206
Just who the hell do
you think you're talking to,

335
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,502
you bastard?

336
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,192
Have you even seen their crew?

337
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,595
A bunch of crackpots
led by a rubber doll!

338
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,431
And you honestly don't
think that I can handle them?

339
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:40,334
No battle is
100 percent guaranteed.

340
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,703
Do you know what
transpired at Enies Lobby?

341
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,005
No one expected
Rob Lucci to lose.

342
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,207
And I'm sure he wasn't
expecting it, either.

343
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,276
Jet...

344
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:55,115
...Gatling!

345
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,370
Let me see
if I get this straight.

346
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:18,338
The government's
so scared of the Straw Hats

347
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:21,642
that they wanna pit two of the
Seven Warlords against them?

348
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:22,576
Huh?

349
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,045
[KUMA] They only
sent me here to warn you.

350
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:28,749
I was given no specific orders
to offer you any assistance.

351
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,485
[MORIA] Then I recommend you
stay out of my damn way, buddy.

352
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,521
And if they want some kind of
report, you can tell 'em this.

353
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,156
This Straw Hat

354
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,058
that's got the government
soiling their britches,

355
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,693
I've already dealt with him!

356
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,094
That means I stole his shadow

357
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,497
and made it a
part of my zombie army!

358
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,034
Kushishishi!

359
00:18:49,236 --> 00:18:51,071
[FRANKY] The fog.

360
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,439
Could it get any worse?

361
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,341
That fog was our last hope.

362
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:56,677
There's nothing
left to block the sun now.

363
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,678
Perfect.

364
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,113
The fog cleared up
at the worst time possible.

365
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,517
I'm really not looking forward
to the sun melting my face off.

366
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,351
Dammit.

367
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,086
Well, this changes
the situation.

368
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,354
At this point, we've
got no choice

369
00:19:07,387 --> 00:19:09,456
but to try and stop Oa...

370
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,060
[MORIA]
Kushishi!

371
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,562
I didn't know it was
such a beautiful night out!

372
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,100
It's... Moria. It's Moria!

373
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,069
Moria? What, where?

374
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:24,137
[SANJI]
What? You're kidding, right?

375
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,039
[MORIA]
Dawn is just around the corner.

376
00:19:26,073 --> 00:19:27,241
Do you think
this is the best time

377
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:29,443
for you to be
standing around?

378
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:33,046
Wait, how are you here?
What happened to Luffy?

379
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,881
Huh?

380
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:36,216
I hear Master
but I can't see him.

381
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,551
Explain this, Usopp.

382
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,319
Just where the hell
are you seeing Moria?

383
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,421
Look up, you idiots,
he's right there!

384
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:43,657
The belly! Inside Oars' belly!

385
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,725
Inside his belly?

386
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,827
He... He is!

387
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:52,666
Kushishishi!

388
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,402
That twisted Hogback.

389
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,304
He's gotta be behind this.

390
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:59,573
What exactly is
he doing inside him?

391
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,174
But where's Luffy?

392
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,809
Aw, don't tell me
they tricked him after all.

393
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:04,578
Or he's done for.

394
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,147
Don't you ever
say Luffy's done for!

395
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,082
Sure.

396
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:10,250
I don't get what's goin' on.

397
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,620
How come I can hear Master's
voice but I can't see him?

398
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:17,424
Is that some kinda
cockpit or somethin?

399
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,360
Crazy. Has there always
been a cockpit in there?

400
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,595
Kushishi!

401
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,031
Hey!

402
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,199
It feels like
it's pretty comfy.

403
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,135
I wanna see da inside.

404
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,703
Hey! Back off, moron!

405
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,372
Don't jam your fingers in here,
you'll break something!

406
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,208
[OARS]
Sorry. Yes, Master.

407
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,444
But really. This is so awesome!

408
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,313
I'm like a robot now!

409
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,150
Activate power, giant robo!

410
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,786
[beeping noises]

411
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,621
Look out!

412
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,623
Behold, zombie robot!

413
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:53,226
I am called, um,
da Oars Bomber! Yeah, that's it!

414
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,561
[USOPP] What the hell
does that even mean?

415
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,296
Oars Bomber?

416
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,165
You're no robot,
you're a zombie!

417
00:20:58,198 --> 00:20:59,499
And robot sounds are like...

418
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,200
[mimics robot]

419
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,535
That's what I'm talkin' about!

420
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,373
My robot sounds
are better dan yours.

421
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,574
Calm down, Oars!

422
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,510
If you don't quit messing
around, you're gonna fall over!

423
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:13,413
Oh, right. Sorry, Master.

424
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,916
Alright, you pathetic
Straw Hats, here I am!

425
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,552
You wanted a chance to
fight me, you've got one!

426
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,887
And if you prove yourselves
skilled enough to defeat me,

427
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,823
I'll release all of the shadows!

428
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,858
Go ahead and
come at me all at once.

429
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,927
But you'll have to
take down Oars, too.

430
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,328
That's the only
chance you've got

431
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,330
to pull me outta this cockpit!

432
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,767
Now that's cheap.
You're not fighting fair!

433
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,670
The only way to defeat
Oars is to defeat Moria first.

434
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,838
But how the heck can we do that

435
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:39,506
with him inside his stomach?

436
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,408
This narrows
our target down to one.

437
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:42,609
Quit complaining.

438
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,611
Can't get cold feet now.

439
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,512
Hey Usopp!

440
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,547
That little pinch
didn't work earlier.

441
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,850
So you're gonna have
to find a mountain of salt!

442
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,386
Our only chance is
to purify that monster.

443
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:55,355
We'll try to weaken him as much
as we can until you get back.

444
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,524
Hell yeah!
That's a plan I can get behind!

445
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:04,698
Let's do this.

446
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:07,300
Yeah. 'Kay,
I got it! I'll be right back!

447
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,535
If I remember correctly,

448
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,637
there's a kitchen somewhere
at the front of the mansion.

449
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,239
They should have
lots of salt there!

450
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:13,440
I should've figured as much.

451
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:14,708
The first thing
they're trying to do

452
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,576
is get their hands on some salt.

453
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,245
Oars. Ya hear that?

454
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:19,579
Better make sure long nose there

455
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:21,448
doesn't make his
way to the kitchen.

456
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:24,384
Ya might as well take out
the entrance to the mansion.

457
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,286
Right. I'll get him.

458
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:28,789
Usopp!

459
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,964
[SANJI]
Did he get him?

460
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,733
Usopp!

461
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,570
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

462
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,507
Kushishishi!

463
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,277
This is bad.
With Moria inside Oars,

464
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,646
that idiot
actually has a brain now.

465
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,614
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

466
00:22:54,648 --> 00:22:56,817
Answer me! Where are you?

467
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,585
[BROOK]
He's perfectly fine!

468
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,859
I thought we might
need a hefty quantity of salt,

469
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,627
so I rounded some up!

470
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:08,929
[FRANKY, ZORO, SANJI,
CHOPPER, ROBIN] Brook?

471
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:11,364
That was a close one!

472
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,767
[BROOK] Were you expecting
someone else to rescue you?

473
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,607
[LUFFY]
Who are you guys?

474
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,008
[RISKY BROS.]
We're the Risky Brothers!

475
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,444
We're gonna give
you incredible powers!

476
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,612
[LUFFY]
You what?

477
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,647
Whoa, wait.
Stop that!

478
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,282
[RISKY BROS.]
What do you think?

479
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,520
[LUFFY] I feel incredible!
Nothing can stop me!

480
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,689
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

481
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,791
"A Secret Plan
to Turn the Tables.

482
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:40,360
Nightmare Luffy
Makes his Appearance."

483
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,529
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
