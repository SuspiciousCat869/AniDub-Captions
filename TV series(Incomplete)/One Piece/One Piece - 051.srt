[BUGGY laughing]

176
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,601
Tell me, Straw Hat,
feel honored?

177
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,571
You'll die in the same place
as the King of the Pirates!

178
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:05,077
[laughing]

179
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,621
The barometric pressure
is falling fast.

180
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,491
I've never seen such
a sharp drop before.

181
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,761
You know, I thought
I felt something strange.

182
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,597
[NAMI] There's a storm headed
straight for the island.

183
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,132
[USOPP]
A storm?

184
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,733
[NAMI] Yeah, we'd better
hurry back to the ship

185
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,668
or we'll be in trouble.

186
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,902
Is it gonna be big?

187
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,437
[ZORO]
Hey!

188
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,438
[NAMI]
Zoro!

189
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,840
Where is he? Have you
guys seen him around?

190
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,609
You mean Luffy?

191
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,780
[ZORO] Yeah. We got separated.
And I keep gettin' this feeling.

192
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,782
It's not good.

193
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,786
It usually means that something
bad's gonna happen.

194
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,322
[TOWNSMAN 7 screams]

195
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,190
[TOWNSMAN 8]
Pirates are here!

196
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,158
[TOWNSMAN 1]
Holy crap!

197
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:52,992
[TOWNSMAN 2]
Run!

198
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,328
[TOWNSMAN 3]
It's Buggy the Clown!

199
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,596
What'd they say?

200
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,764
I think they said Buggy.

201
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,171
[SMOKER]
Hmm. And then what?

202
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,539
[GENERAL]
Well, sir,

203
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,840
it isn't just Straw Hat Luffy,

204
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,810
it's also Buggy the Clown,
and Iron Club Alvida.

205
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,146
They're all there! Wanted
pirates from the East Blue

206
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,316
have taken over
our town square!

207
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,720
They do all of this
right in front of me?

208
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,189
Why those arrogant scumbags.

209
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,792
Captain Smoker, sir,
what are your orders?

210
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,828
Send unit number one
out to the sea,

211
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,297
and have unit number two
surround the pirates

212
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,531
from the streets.

213
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,834
The rest will stand by within
shooting range of the square.

214
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,335
See that it's done.

215
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,670
[GENERAL]
Sir!

216
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,406
[SMOKER]
And give this order to unit one.

217
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,809
They are to crush any pirate
ships as soon as they see them.

218
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,178
I don't want a single one
of those wretched pirates

219
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,413
to get off this island.

220
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,682
Not a single one.

221
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,189
[TOWNSMAN 5]
It's time for the execution!

222
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:00,192
[TOWNSMAN 4] Buggy the Clown
is gonna kill Straw Hat Luffy!

223
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,260
Yeah!

224
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,229
They're gonna execute him?!

225
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,597
That freakin' idiot!

226
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,598
[ZORO]
Let's go!

227
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,365
[SANJI]
Hold this.

228
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,868
[USOPP yelping]

229
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,836
[USOPP]
San‐‐ Sanji!

230
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,540
[SANJI] And treat it like
a lady, you got that?!

231
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,875
[NAMI]
Come on, we gotta hurry!

232
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,410
[USOPP]
Where're we goin', Nami?!

233
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,211
[NAMI]
The harbor, you numbskull!

234
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,848
[USOPP] Harbor?
Oh yeah, I knew that!

235
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,552
[MARINE A]
Captain Smoker. Look!

236
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,454
[MARINE B]
Things are getting weird.

237
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,892
[SMOKER]
It's that kid.

238
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,460
What's he doing out there?

239
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,562
Well, if I didn't
know any better,

240
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:40,900
I would say that Monkey D. Luffy
is about to be executed.

241
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,736
[SMOKER]
That kid looks pathetic.

242
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,575
Personal quest. To see where
the King of the Pirates died.

243
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,911
Huh...

244
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,448
[SMOKER] For some reason
that kid caught my attention.

245
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,751
I thought he was different
from the others.

246
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:03,322
Looks like he's nothing
but pirate scum after all.

247
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,591
Captain, we are
ready to attack.

248
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:06,759
Don't be hasty.

249
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,328
But we've got them
surrounded, sir!

250
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,264
I'm in command! You got it?

251
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,833
Yes, sir.

252
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,268
[SMOKER] One pirate is
about to kill another.

253
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:21,307
Let them fight it out first.
That'll save us the trouble.

254
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,443
Listen, once that
Straw Hat loses his head,

255
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,580
we surround Buggy,
Alvida, and their gang.

256
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,348
And do it fast!

257
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,622
[BUGGY laughing]

258
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,358
[BUGGY]
Pirate Monkey D. Luffy...

259
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,796
...of the Straw Hats,
will be flashily executed..

260
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,367
...for the crime of being stuck
up and making me angry!

261
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,936
Now live it up flashily!

262
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,342
Oh boy, I've never
seen an execution.

263
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,611
Well, you're about to kid.

264
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,879
[LUFFY]
Hm?

265
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,814
What?! Stop joking!

266
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,783
It's no joke.

267
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,683
[LUFFY] Take this
board off, you bastard!

268
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,853
[BUGGY] All right!
I hereby flashily begin

269
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,657
the festivities of this
public execution!

270
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,827
[BUGGY laughing]

271
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,546
[NAMI] I saw a massive cumulus
cloud in the eastern sky!

272
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,382
That means an unimaginably
big storm is headed our way.

273
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,484
And it's coming in fast!

274
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,052
If Buggy and Luffy
have caused a scene,

275
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,721
the Marines are sure
to come out.

276
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,691
And if our ship is washed out
to sea when we need to escape,

277
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,692
we're done for.

278
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,160
That is a big deal!

279
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,261
As a matter of fact,

280
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,164
I bet the Marines have already
started taking action!

281
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,367
And they'll destroy the
Going Merry if they find it!

282
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,435
[USOPP]
Hold on!

283
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,672
So you're telling me the
Going Merry's in danger?!

284
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,042
[USOPP]
C'mon, Nami! Hurry up!

285
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,711
[NAMI]
Wait for me!

286
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,680
[UNIT LEADER]
Okay, men, double time!

287
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,715
We have to get to the
harbor immediately

288
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,750
and destroy every
last pirate vessel!

289
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,118
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

290
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,561
[MOHJI] ♪ Riding around
on a Ritchie bike! ♪

291
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,798

Who's that man? Who? Who? ♪

Oh yes, it's me!

294
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,575
So this is the rubber
guy's ship, huh?

295
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,744
[RICHIE]
Uh‐huh.

296
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:39,912
Would ya look at that?

297
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,815
He's got a bigger ship. He
won't need it where he's going.

298
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:47,086
Cause it's almost time for Buggy
to flashily finish him off.

299
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,154
However, just in case
the rubber guy,

300
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,591
who has absolutely no chance of
escaping, happens to escape,

301
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,994
we need to burn this ship down.

302
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,730
Burning wood smells so good.

303
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,733

304
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm so sorry. Really, I am.
Please spare my life.

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,242
Why would I spare your life?!

306
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,479
This is what happens
when you go against us.

307
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,449
I guess this is it for
the man I had my eye on.

308
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,619
You've got quite a big audience
here today, Straw Hat.

309
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,623
You wanna say a few
words before you die?

310
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,926
Oh? Cat got your tongue?

311
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,662
That's all right. Stay quiet,
or say a few words,

312
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,765
it doesn't matter,
you're still gonna die!

313
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:40,873
Listen! I'm the man who'll
be King of the Pirates!

I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:49,481
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

316
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,987
[TOWNSMAN 6]
What?

317
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,790
[TOWNSMAN 7]
He said... King of the Pirates.

318
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,025

In this town of all places?

That's a crazy thing to say.

320
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,001
We're finally getting to
the best part of the show.

321
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,469
Bye, bye now.

You startin' a sideshow?

00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,664
Or is that just how
you look? Pretty sad.

331
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,034
Now what we gotta do is
drive these goons away.

332
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,903

N‐No! It's pirate hunter Zoro!

Hey, guys! Heh!

335
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,278
You made it, Zoro! But you're
just a little bit too late.

336
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,516
[ZORO] We gotta bring
down the platform

337
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,918
Roronoa... Zoro.

338
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,689
Okay, boys! Get 'em!

339
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,524
[PIRATE A]
Let's do it!

340
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,359

Yeah!

can stop me now!

There's nothing you two can do!

00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,414
It's the end for your captain!

346
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,715
Bastard!

347
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,388
[ZORO] If I can just cut
down the platform...

348
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,322
[MARINE C]
Listen.

349
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,658
The moment Monkey D.
Luffy's head falls,

350
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,227
we all attack together.

351
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,731
Prepare for battle.

352
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,565
[MARINES]
Sir!

353
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:53,072
[BUGGY laughing]

354
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,074
[LUFFY]
Zoro! Sanji!

355
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,576
Usopp! Nami!

356
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,078
Sorry.

357
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,182
[LUFFY]
But... I'm dead.

358
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
[ZORO]
Idiot!

359
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,521
[SANJI]
Don't say that!

360
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,590
He smiled.

361
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,394
[laughing]

362
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,165
I'm still alive! That's nice!

363
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,772
That was divine intervention.

364
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,843
[ZORO] Stop talkin' nonsense.
We gotta get outta this town.

365
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,511
Our troubles are not over.

366
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,180
[LUFFY laughing]

367
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,553
Attack! Surround all
the pirates now!

368
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,623
[MARINES yelling]

369
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,392
[SANJI]
Here they come!

370
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,467
Oh wow! So cool!

371
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,237
Everybody here went
crazy so quickly.

372
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,737
[ZORO]
Luffy!

373
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,573
[LUFFY screaming]

374
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,807
Zoro!

375
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,776
We don't have time for this.
We have got to get outta here.

376
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,711
We'd better hurry back
to the Going Merry

377
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,147
or we'll never be able
to leave this island.

378
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,216
And we sure as hell
won't get to the Grand Line!

379
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,886
Really? Well,
that's no good. Run!

380
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,289
The Straw Hat Gang
is getting away!

381
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,091
[MARINE C]
Capture them!

382
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,731
[SMOKER]
Why did he smile?

383
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:36,401
Did he know he'd be saved?

384
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,636
No.

385
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:42,507
At that moment, he was certain
that his life was about to end.

386
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,176
He simply accepted death,

387
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,812
and smiled after
preparing himself.

388
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,748
Captain, we have to
pursue the pirates.

389
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,485
Lieutenant, think back.

390
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,621
Have you ever seen
any pirates who smiled

391
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,924
on the execution platform?

392
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,825
[LT. COMMANDER]
No, sir.

393
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,793
It doesn't matter how
tough the guy is.

394
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,764
At the moment of death, they all
turn pale and die in despair.

395
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,469
[SMOKER] That Straw Hat
man smiled. I saw it.

396
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,339
He smiled just like
Gold Roger, 22 years ago.

397
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,209
Just like the old King
of the Pirates did

398
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,345
on that exact
execution platform.

399
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,823
Captain.

400
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,659
Where's the Straw Hat man now?

401
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,826
Sir.

402
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,496
He slipped past us and is
heading towards the harbor.

403
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,734
[SMOKER] Unit one should've
destroyed their ship by now.

404
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,971
Well, sir. They had to return
to port for a refitting.

405
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,408
See, they couldn't light their
powder due to the sudden rain.

406
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,209
[SMOKER]
What?!

407
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,477
But a reserve unit

408
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,314
is currently making preparations
to attack the ship instead.

409
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,382
Captain Smoker,
if we let them sail now,

410
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,984
they'll be able to
get to the Grand Line

411
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,687
before we can capture them.

412
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,589
[SMOKER] The wind is blowing
towards the west.

413
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,326
It's a tailwind for that ship.

414
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,497
[SMOKER]
Is this just mere coincidence?

415
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,335
It's as if heaven itself
has special plans

416
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,904
for this young pirate.

417
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,007
[ZORO] We'd better pick up
the pace or we're toast!

418
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,376
[SMOKER]
I am White Hunter Smoker.

419
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,912
On my honor as Marine Captain,

420
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:31,450
I won't let that man
leave this island!

421
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:57,776
[MAN] Blow, winds!
The storm of fate has arrived!

422
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,718
<i>♪All that's in my</i>
<i>heart confuses me,</i>

423
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,820
<i>I cannot understand,</i>

424
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,889
<i>As I face what I must do,</i>

425
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,792
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand.</i>

426
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,394
<i>I'll set sail alone,</i>

427
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,730
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near,</i>

428
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,399
<i>As I drift away,</i>

429
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,336
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear.</i>

430
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,578
<i>As I watch the sunrise,</i>
<i>I began to wonder,</i>

431
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:38,316
<i>What could be the reason,</i>
<i>It's so hot inside.</i>

432
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,652
<i>No answer has come,</i>

433
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,689
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true,</i>

434
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,528
<i>It's because of you...</i>

435
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,997
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings,</i>

436
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,533
<i>Get 'em to come back to me,</i>

437
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,967
<i>I'll do what I must,</i>

438
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,504
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be.</i>

439
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,506
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

440
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,443
<i>And pull 'em back</i>
<i>from yesterday,</i>

441
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,445
<i>If I'm holding hands with you,</i>

442
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,815
<i>I'm sure that we</i>
<i>can make the way.♪</i>
