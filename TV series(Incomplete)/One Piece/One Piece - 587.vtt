00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.437
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.474
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:10.176
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.379
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.581
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.384
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.586
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.554
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:25.258
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:30.296
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:40.093
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.929
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:48.168
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.737
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.940
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.842
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:58.278
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.847
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.652
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.153
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.990
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.195
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.832
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.435
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:27.774
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:31.644
Receiving a distress call,
the crew lands on Punk Hazard,

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.447
[NARRATOR] The mysterious
island is divided in two.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.650
One half burning and
the other half frozen.

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.886
I'm not letting them get away.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.221
Room!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.290
[ALL gasp]

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.694
Hey. Did you guys just see that?
The air's all murky.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.032
[ALL gasp]

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.001
All right, Shambles!

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:01.841
[ALL gasp with different voices]

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:06.312
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
O-Okay. Just calm down!

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.681
I know! Let's do roll call!

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:09.549
Chopper!

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.550
Here!

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.517
Franky!

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:12.652
'Sup!

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.687
[NAMI (FRANKY) grunts]
Sanji?

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.390
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.158
I mean, yes?

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.361
That means you're... Nami?

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:22.662
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Mm-hm!

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.997
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.767
[CREW]
Why did we switch bodies?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.304
[SMOKER] Warlord or not, you've
pushed your luck too far now!

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.343
The Op-Op Fruit, huh?
Let's see what it's made of!

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:38.645
[gasps]

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.349
Don't let him cut you, men!
Just stay away!

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.918
[MARINES gasp]

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.590
I don't need you here!
Get outside of the circle!

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.458
Wait, what circle?

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:54.594
Look as long as you're
in this vicinity,

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:57.764
you're like a patient
on an operating table!

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.465
Law is the Surgeon of Death.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.703
He can control anything within
his operating room at will!

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.405
He'll end you!

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:11.044
Stop Tashigi! You can't win!
Your Haki's too weak!

00:05:11.077 --> 00:05:14.414
[TASHIGI shouts]

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.589
[TASHIGI breathes deeply]

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.130
[MARINES]
No, it can't be!

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.041
[LUFFY] "A Collision!
Law VS. Vice Admiral Smoker!"

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.186
[gasps]

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.424
Heh!

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:03.463
[MARINES gasp]

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.475
[MARINES gasp]

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:16.709
[gasps]

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:22.048
[MARINE M] Wha-- You cut her
clean in half, you sick bastard!

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.321
[MARINE H] Hey, uh,
you're still alive, right?

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.189
Say something!

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:39.265
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.636
[TASHIGI]
Pathetic. Lying here in pieces.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.873
Cut down but left
to live in shame.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:49.876
[grunts]

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.577
Why won't you finish me?

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.413
Trafalgar!

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.081
Heh.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.384
[grunts]

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:02.655
[LAW] You may wield a sword, but
don't act like you're a master.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:05.525
Honor is something that
you earn, not beg for.

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:08.027
[grunts]

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.998
Weaklings like you don't get
to choose where they die.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.066
[grunts]

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:15.735
[TASHIGI]
Enough!

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:19.705
Your sword can't even
reach me. Don't bother.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.976
[TASHIGI grunts]

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.916
You still want to fight?
I can chop you up some more.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.484
[gasps]

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:35.755
Stand back!

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.558
If you lay another finger on
our captain, we'll mess you up!

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.426
Hey, Captain, don't worry!

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.896
We'll see how cocky this bastard
is after we fill him with lead!

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.937
--[MARINES shout]
--[MARINE C] The hell...?

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:54.774
How is he shooting at us?
I don't see any gun!

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.876
We shot him and he
didn't even budge!

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.712
You shot at yourselves,
you bunch of imbeciles.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:02.248
I switched your bullets
with the falling snow.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:06.786
Ah! Hey, he's cheating!
That isn't fair!

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.722
[MARINE N] Get down! He'll take
your head clean off, man!

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.324
[MARINE A]
He cut a damn ship in half!

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.793
You can't stop this guy!

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:17.563
[MARINE N] He's too strong!
Get outta there, Captain!

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.965
[gasps]

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.502
[MARINES]
Captain, no!

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.003
[grunts]

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.375
[gasps]

00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:40.486
[growls]

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.990
Yeah! Captain Smokey!

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.092
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:50.329
[SMOKER] You may be a Warlord,
but you're still just a pirate.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.532
Don't mess with the Navy.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.668
'Cause I will put you
in your place, boy.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.138
[LAW]
Huh?

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.408
[SMOKER shouts]

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.511
[gasps]

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.650
[LAW] That weapon
you're swinging around.

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:13.219
It's tipped with
sea prism stone.

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.254
I could feel it in an instant.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:27.500
[MARINE B] His ice sculpture--
I mean, our ship is coming down!

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.036
I think that's our
cue to run away.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:33.205
We can't fight him anyway!
We got no business here!

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.410
[MARINES shouting]

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.381
I don't need to kick your ass,

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.483
but if you don't get the
hell out of my way,

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:46.652
I sure will, got it?

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:50.022
Your call, pirate,
so what's it gonna be?

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.193
No, Vice Admiral, wait!

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:56.395
He'll be okay!
There's nothing we can do!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.430
It's our fight!

00:09:57.463 --> 00:09:59.165
I'm telling you, we're dead
weight right now!

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:00.566
White Blow!

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.106
[MARINE C] Outta the circle!
Get outta the circle!

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:27.126
[CENTAURS groan]

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.162
We can't beat them.
They're too strong.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:33.232
Straw Hat and his crew,
they're monsters.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:36.802
Damn it. And they
took the Boss, too.

00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.404
What d'we do now?

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:41.907
[CENTAUR D grunts] We...
We gotta rescue him, somehow!

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.510
He can't get out of this one
alone and those pirates

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:47.179
are crazy! There's no
telling what they might do!

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.615
How are we supposed
to fight, though?

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.753
[CENTAUR A grunts] Let's ask
the Master! He'll know!

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:56.622
Anyone who can still stand,
follow me!

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.167
[LUFFY]
That noise sure was loud, huh?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.969
I bet it was Sanji.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.005
[LUFFY]
Hey, Crocotaur.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:15.808
You still don't wanna tell me
where the rest of my crew is at?

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.942
Keep dreaming,

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:19.478
but you're not gonna get a
word outta me, all right?

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:22.214
Fine then! But can't you
run faster at least?

00:11:22.248 --> 00:11:24.350
My friends could be in
real trouble right now.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.052
We gotta get to that
big building before

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.386
someone gets hurt!

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.389
Like me? Or my
crew you robbed?

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.726
You're nothing but
a bunch of thugs.

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.195
And now you gotta
humiliate me like this?

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:38.964
You're just crying 'cause
you got your ass beat.

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:42.134
Don't pin this on us.
You're the one who attacked!

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:46.172
Man up, Man-o-dile.
Croco-man. Whatever...

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.040
Brook, you don't even have skin.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.676
You're sitting there shivering,
but you can't be cold, right?

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.345
Did you just steal that coat
because you wanted to fit in?

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.647
What if I did?

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.017
Is it so wrong to want to share
in the suffering of my friends?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.885
"Cold" is a state
of mind, after all.

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.320
You don't need skin for that!

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:02.988
We've been able to keep
ourselves warm,

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.691
but I fear the others
might not be so fortunate.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.327
If they get frostbite, they
could lose any number of limbs.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.665
That's enough! Just spare us
your gruesome concerns, okay?

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:17.703
[BROWNBEARD pants]

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.611
[SUBORDINATE A]
What should we do, Master?

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.881
Law and Smoker are having
an all-out battle outside.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.386
Law has made a
nuisance of himself.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.789
He was supposed to make
them leave peacefully.

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:39.258
[SUBORDINATE A] Also, the
pirates took the children

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.360
from the Biscuit Room
with them to the front.

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:42.528
They ran into Law,

00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:44.764
but it doesn't look like
they're part of the struggle.

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:48.067
[CAESAR CLOWN] Wait, that means
that the Navy saw the children?

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.201
[SUBORDINATE A]
Yes sir.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:52.238
[CAESAR CLOWN] That was
the last thing I wanted.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.472
They might not know what,

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.775
but now they know
we're up to something.

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:00.246
At this point,
even if we kill Smoker,

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.582
the Navy will only send more
Marines to investigate us.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:04.984
[MONET]
I thought so.

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:07.419
Huh? I hope you have
something helpful

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.222
to contribute to this, Monet.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.258
[MONET]
I know who our intruders are.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.227
[laughs]
Never mind Smoker,

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:17.463
we should have kept a
tighter leash on them.

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.397
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.167
Oh, right. I guess
I neglected to tell you.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.803
They already took out
Doctor Vegapunk's dragon,

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:26.405
as well as Brownbeard's
centaur patrol unit.

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:27.473
They did what?

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:28.741
[SUBORDINATE A]
How?

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:31.577
The people that you kidnapped
weren't their only crew members,

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.779
just the only crew
members on the ship.

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.483
The rest had already set off
for the Burning Lands.

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.285
They've since crossed the lake.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:42.354
I imagine they'll be
here any minute now.

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.522
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:47.827
[MONET] At least we know who
we're dealing with. Y'see?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.496
There's no doubting
it's them, right?

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.999
The faces match. That's true.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.335
Don't tell me you've never
heard of the Straw Hats!

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.603
They're quite famous.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.705
Mostly for picking fights
with the World Government,

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:01.941
which they seem to do
at every opportunity.

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:05.277
That might be convenient.
If they're so notorious,

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:08.214
maybe we can spin a story
with them as the villains!

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.050
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:14.620
They're enemies with
Smoker of the Navy.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:17.356
That gives us a perfect excuse
to wipe out both groups

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:19.391
of troublemakers and
shift the blame.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:21.794
Why, we may keep
our secrets yet!

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:22.862
[SUBORDINATE A]
But Master,

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.130
I don't see how that's any
different than before.

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.799
If we wipe out the G-5 Marines,

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:30.236
then surely HQ would send
another group to investigate.

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:33.305
Well, not if we control
the narrative in advance.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.908
And I know someone
who can help.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:40.946
[laughs]

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.249
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Call Joker.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:44.516
[SUBORDINATE A]
Right!

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:16.215
Okay, we made
it outside. Now what?

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.484
We have all these
children and its freezing!

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.619
All we can do is run
and figure it out later.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:23.055
Just like this weird
body-switching thing!

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:27.793
Yeah, what's up with that, bro?
This mess is super confusing me.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:28.894
It's too cold!

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.796
If we don't run
someplace warm,

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:31.897
we'll freeze to death!

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:35.367
Who cares if it's cold?
Not me, I say!

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.568
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.470
[SANJI (NAMI)] Who cares about
the samurai and the brats?

00:15:38.504 --> 00:15:40.139
Not me, I say!

00:15:40.172 --> 00:15:41.340
[ALL]
What?

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:43.208
[SANJI (NAMI)] More importantly,
where can I find a camera?

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:46.045
I gotta take some pictures
before we all change back!

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.746
Pictures of what exactly?

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.416
And stop making my nose bleed!
Or your nose or whatever!

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.917
If we're making demands, Nami,

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.421
then unbutton my shirt so I can
show off my mecha pecs!

00:15:55.454 --> 00:15:57.423
I know it's cold.
Hang in there!

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.825
We can make it!
We'll figure something out!

00:15:59.858 --> 00:16:01.827
[BOY A] I liked it better
when you weren't so nice.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.329
This is kinda creeping me out!

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.663
I don't get it.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.333
Did someone play a trick and
make you switch bodies?

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.902
It's strange, but that would
appear to be the case.

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:12.004
Just keep running! We're fine!

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.505
Although you have my sympathy,

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.241
I'm grateful that my
treatment has improved.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.517
It's so cold without my fur!

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.419
You humans sure do
have it rough!

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.520
[BOY B grunts]

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.756
[GIRL B gasps]

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:32.891
You gotta stop! He needs help!

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:34.393
[ALL]
Huh?

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:36.929
[BOY B grunts]
It's too cold.

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:37.930
[GIRL B gasps]

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:41.300
I can't move! I'm freezing!

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.301
Me too!

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:43.702
I'm starting to get scared!

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.405
Damn it. We should've
taken the kids with us

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:48.640
until we figured
out where to go.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.344
On the upside, I don't feel cold
at all with Chopper's fur on.

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.793
[MARINE H pants]

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:10.429
So long, ship.
There's no fixing that.

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:12.231
Come on, just hang
in there, Smokey!

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:14.433
How you doin'?
Got your legs back yet?

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.901
You're not in any
pain now, are you?

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.903
Hey, you got a foot on
your wrist there, pal,

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:19.438
you're gonna wanna
take care of that.

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.640
[MARINE J]
Huh? Aw jeez, you're right!

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:23.675
I don't even know who
this foot belongs to!

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.912
[MARINE D] Damn it! We can't
even contact HQ anymore.

00:17:26.945 --> 00:17:28.981
We're stranded on
this crappy island!

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:29.915
[MARINE E]
Law's a jerk!

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:32.484
I thought the Warlords
were on our side!

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:36.789
Hey, wait. You can't go fight!
That's nuts! Smokey's got this!

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.223
[TASHIGI grunts]

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.361
[SMOKER]
There's one thing you always

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:44.463
need to remember, Tashigi!

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:49.268
A pirate's a pirate,
no matter where they go!

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:51.103
They never change!

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:52.838
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:57.409
All Warlords are the same.
He was right.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.861
[gasps]

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.815
[SMOKER] You wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:39.351
Surely, you're aware that no
one's allowed to step foot

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:40.886
on this island, Law.

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:43.322
Not pirates or
Government allies.

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.690
That clear?

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:48.861
[LAW] Hm! I see. Then that means
you aren't allowed either.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:54.933
Law, what kind of secret would
make you resort to fighting us?

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:59.872
This plan must be why you joined
up with the Seven Warlords,

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:02.941
isn't it? But what the
hell are you after?

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.304
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.876
[SMOKER] What we need
is a higher rank.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.646
After that incident at Enies
Lobby, pirates from all over

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:44.883
the world will be looking up
to Straw Hat and his crew.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.585
I see.

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.921
I'm putting my pride
on the line here.

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:52.558
I swear I will crush
them in the New World!

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.093
[TASHIGI] It's not enough
to just hope for the best.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.962
If we want to fight pirates
in the New World,

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.964
we need true conviction.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:02.234
There's no room for mercy
on this battlefield.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.869
Not anymore.

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:08.974

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.849
[grunts]

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:31.463
I've never been a fan
of the Warlord system.

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:35.801
Pirates can't be trusted,
no matter who they are.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:39.004
[LAW]
Hm! Ya got that one right.

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:48.880
[grunts]

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:54.886
[SMOKER]
Huh?

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:08.667
[SMOKER] Law. There's something
big going on here.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.272
And you're only part of it.

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:17.743
[SMOKER] Who is it?
Who's running this show?

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:18.944
[gasps]

00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.248
[shouts]

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.516
[LAW shouts]

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:28.854
[LAW]
You talk first!

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:31.123
[growls]

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.828
What's your story?
What are you doing here?

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:38.063
[SMOKER]
Heh.

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.034
[grunts]

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.517
[LAW] If ya wanna get to
the bottom of something,

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.353
then ya gotta broaden
your horizons.

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:03.322
Or you'll miss the truth!

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.658
Scalpel!

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.144
[breathes heavily]

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.946
[SMOKER]
My heart!

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.865
You can beg, but I don't have
to tell you a damn thing.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:51.703
[SMOKER grunts]

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.164
[NARRATOR] Smoker collapses
when his heart is taken.

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:21.666
As Law looks coldly
down upon him,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.503
Tashigi and the G-5 are
overcome with anger.

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.371
But before they can
avenge thier leader,

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.006
Luffy arrives.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:30.142
Given the connection Luffy and
Law shared during the

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:33.812
War of the Best, this encounter
could change everything.

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:35.447
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.151
"Meeting Again After Two Years!
Luffy And Law!"

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:41.820
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
