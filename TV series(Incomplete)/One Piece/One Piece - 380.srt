347
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,907
Well, it would seem
we're down to a quartet.

348
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,328
[BROOK]
A trio.

349
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,250
And a duet.

350
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,430
[BROOK]
A solo.

351
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,022
It isn't right.

352
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,191
Leaving just the accompaniment.

353
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,651
[YORKI] If you want
to join my crew,

354
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,404
all I ask is
that you love music!

355
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,364
[YORKI] Let's hear it
for the Rumbar Pirates!

356
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,408
The crew that brings
a smile to every child!

357
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,494
[ALL cheering]

358
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,704
[YORKI]
Laboon!

359
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,248
Once we travel the world,
we're comin' right back here!

360
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,126
[YORKI]
You just wait for us!

361
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:47,032
[BROOK] Laboon, thank you
for waiting for us.

362
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,160
I know that 50 years
is a long time.

363
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,455
But please, do you think
you could be patient

364
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,624
for one or two more?

365
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,464
I have my pride as a pirate.

366
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,466
I promised you
I would see you again

367
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,468
after circling the globe.

368
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,095
I intend to keep my word

369
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,555
and return from the
right direction.

370
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,815
My name is Brook.

371
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,485
I have died and then
skeletonized yet still I live.

372
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,028
I am a wanted man.

373
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,781
I have a bounty
of 33 million berries.

374
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:33,161
And as of today, my life belongs
to you, Captain Straw Hat Luffy!

375
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,746
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

376
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,333
"A New Crewmate: The Musician,
Humming Brook!"

377
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,669
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
