WEBVTT

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.639
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:40.548
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:45.797
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.371
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:51.614
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.647 --> 00:02:53.520
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:56.028
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.869
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:03.349
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:04.887
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:08.665
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.978
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:16.790
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:18.763
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:21.069
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.845
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:26.820
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:29.327
In response, Doflamingo
trapped the kingdom inside

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.300
a barrier known as
the "Birdcage"

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.607
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.947
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:40.126
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.597
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:44.038
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:44.072 --> 00:03:46.411
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:46.444 --> 00:03:49.521
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.640
[BELLAMY]
I can't go on like this.

00:03:55.673 --> 00:03:58.247
I have to settle things!

00:04:03.028 --> 00:04:04.566
[LUFFY]
"A United Front!

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240
Luffy's Breakthrough
to the Victory!"

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:25.596
[DOFLAMINGO]
How strange.

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.273
To be feeling sentimental
at a time like this.

00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:35.091
Why did you come here?

00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:41.577
I don't suppose you're
going to tell me

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:44.854
you killed Straw Hat
like I asked?

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:48.631
Why did you send
Dellinger to take me out?

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:52.678
Was he really doing that
on your order like he said?

00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:56.755
Come on. It's obvious.

00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:05.014
Is there any hope...
for me to join you?

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:11.433
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles] You really
want me to spell it out for you?

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.071
All right.

00:05:14.442 --> 00:05:17.752
[DOFLAMINGO] Your purpose has
never been the same as mine.

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:19.959
Even from the start.

00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:22.701
[DOFLAMINGO]
For example, you always wanted

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:25.676
to be a pirate, right?

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.417
Me, not so much.

00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:30.992
The methods didn't matter.

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:32.730
For what?

00:05:35.874 --> 00:05:38.850
For the only thing I care about.

00:05:38.883 --> 00:05:41.992
Destroying this world.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.136
[chuckles]

00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:20.306
[LUFFY yelling]

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.984
Outta the way,
I'm comin' through!

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:26.458
You're the one
in my way. Move.

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:27.394
What's that?

00:06:27.427 --> 00:06:29.502
I'm taking down Dofloamingo.

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:31.172
Back off, both of you!

00:06:31.206 --> 00:06:33.045
I'm paying back
my debt to Straw Hat

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:35.151
and kicking Doflamingo's ass.

00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:37.023
All on my own!

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:40.735
[SULEIMAN]
Get out of my way, child.

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.306
I'm in quite the hurry.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:46.017
[squeals, laughs]

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.728
Really? You think
I'm just a child?

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:51.499
"Suleiman the Beheader"!

00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:53.038
Doesn't that sound scary!

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:54.442
[SULEIMAN]
He's fast!

00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:56.516
[DELLINGER squeals] So how many
heads have you taken?

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:59.223
A hundred? A thousand?

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:02.767
[DELLINGER laughs]

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.938
[SULEIMAN]
Show off all you like,

00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:05.609
but I'm not going to
lose sight of you.

00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:09.053
If I recall, you were
a war executioner, right?

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:14.603
[DELLINGER laughs]

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:17.611
[SULEIMAN]
His leg muscles look strong.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:18.983
And since he's
wearing high heels,

00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:20.688
I think I know his specialty.

00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.927
I love executions, too, y'know!

00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:24.431
He's a kicker!

00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:29.547
[laughs]

00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:45.327
[DELLINGER] Aw, what a shame.
It's over already.

00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:50.309
[gasps]

00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:00.139
Damn it.
The Executives are here.

00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:06.023
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES cheering]

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.309
[laughs] Send whoever you
like! It's too late now!

00:08:12.342 --> 00:08:15.151
I got a debt to repay
and I'm gonna do it!

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:18.194
It's that Happosui
Army guy, Chin Jao!

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:19.764
Let's get that bounty!

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:22.540
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:25.983
[CHIN JAO]
Ha! It's futile.

00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:29.794
[CHIN JAO grunts]

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.474
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:37.685
Onward! Looks like I'll
be reaching the third level

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:39.624
before anyone else!

00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:44.205
[CHIN JAO] Hm? What are these
strange, bulbous masses?

00:08:44.238 --> 00:08:46.512
[GLADIUS]
Careful, it's not safe there.

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:48.183
Mine... Pop!

00:08:48.216 --> 00:08:51.994
[CHIN JAO screams]

00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:54.201
[BOO]
Grandpa! I'm on my way!

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:58.714
[MACHVISE]
Da-een! Floaty, floaty.

00:08:59.784 --> 00:09:01.556
[MACHVISE]
Ten-Ton Vise!

00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:06.805
[MACHVISE laughs]

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.611
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D cackles]

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:09.781
Yeah! Suck on that!

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:13.058
The Family Executives
are gonna brutalize you!

00:09:13.092 --> 00:09:17.204
[LAO G chuckles]
It's not that we're too strong,

00:09:17.237 --> 00:09:19.243
it's that they are gutless.

00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:23.857
And that's with a capital G!

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.197
Can it, you old fart!

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.568
[LAO G]
G!

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:31.212
[LAO G grunting]

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:32.916
[ORLUMBUS]
Stop that!

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.336
Sucker!

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.278
You losers aren't
going anywhere now!

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.357
[DAGAMA]
I got you!

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:49.734
[BABY 5]
Armsmorphosis!

00:09:49.767 --> 00:09:51.540
Revolver Leg!

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:06.383
[TOWNSWOMAN A] Darling. I'm
begging you, don't do this.

00:10:08.456 --> 00:10:10.163
[TOWNSMAN A]
This is a nightmare.

00:10:10.196 --> 00:10:12.669
This is the last thing
I would ever want.

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:16.848
You know this isn't me!

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:22.499
[TOWNSMAN A] I'm trying,
but I can't fight Doflamingo.

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:27.948
[TOWNSMAN A] I've lost control.
Forget about me!

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:32.830
Run away! Hurry!

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:42.626
[sobs] Please, no. Stop.

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:49.379
Okay, go!

00:10:49.413 --> 00:10:50.950
[TOWNSMAN C]
Bring the rope, quick!

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.993
And treat him!
He's been shot!

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:55.966
Time to put out the fire. Ready?

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:57.102
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:10:57.135 --> 00:11:01.248
I'm sorry. Thank you!
You saved me!

00:11:01.282 --> 00:11:04.424
I was about to
kill my own family!

00:11:04.457 --> 00:11:06.297
I'd rather die!

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.807
[cries]

00:11:17.497 --> 00:11:19.101
Once wasn't enough?

00:11:19.134 --> 00:11:20.740
You'd cause the
same tragedy again

00:11:20.773 --> 00:11:24.417
for your own hubris, Doflamingo?

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.257
[USOPP] As long as our
Captain's here to help,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.463
everything'll work out.

00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:36.588
[TOWNSMAN E]
I saw Rebecca float down.

00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:38.694
She and the others were
somewhere up there.

00:11:38.727 --> 00:11:41.570
[TOWNSMAN F gasps]
Is that King Riku?

00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:43.542
What? Let me see!

00:11:44.713 --> 00:11:47.988
[TOWNSMAN E gasps] That guy
with the huge bounty!

00:11:48.022 --> 00:11:51.366
[TOWNSMAN A] I set the
town on fire! I'm sorry!

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:54.241
I cut up my own best friend!

00:11:54.274 --> 00:11:56.749
So did I! It was awful!

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.988
Nobody blames you for this.

00:11:59.021 --> 00:11:59.957
You're a victim.

00:11:59.991 --> 00:12:02.498
We all know this is
Doflamingo's work.

00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:06.142
We gotta bring an end to
this sadistic game somehow.

00:12:06.176 --> 00:12:07.582
[TOWNSMAN F]
Hey!

00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:09.954
I was looking around
and found King Riku!

00:12:09.988 --> 00:12:12.963
And he's got that Five-star
God Usopp guy with him!

00:12:12.996 --> 00:12:13.666
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.872
All right. Let's do it.

00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:19.884
[TOWNSMAN D] Right, but we're
only capturing them. Understand?

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:22.759
Uh-huh. There's been
enough killing today!

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:24.732
Let's put an end to this!

00:12:24.765 --> 00:12:26.705
[TOWNSMAN D] Move in quick,
then take King Riku

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:28.443
and God Usopp as hostages.

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:29.948
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.723
Then we can use them to lure in
the others with star bounties.

00:12:32.756 --> 00:12:34.126
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.168
Tell everyone you can!

00:12:40.244 --> 00:12:43.053
We'll all come together
at the Old King's Plateau.

00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:46.262
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:12:47.265 --> 00:12:48.202
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:49.607
[gasps]

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.980
Surround both the targets
and don't let them get away!

00:12:52.013 --> 00:12:55.256
This is it. We're ending
the game right now!

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.868
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah!

00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.874
[gasps]

00:13:00.907 --> 00:13:04.150
[KIN'EMON]
Kanjuro! I beseech you!

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.792
Reveal your location!

00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:09.231
It is your friend Kin'emon!

00:13:09.264 --> 00:13:14.648
I have come down here
to retrieve you! Come out!

00:13:14.682 --> 00:13:20.967
[growling]

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.438
[TOWNSMAN M]
There it goes again.

00:13:22.472 --> 00:13:24.411
Sounds like some
kind of monster.

00:13:24.444 --> 00:13:27.487
[TOWNSMAN N] That's so creepy!
Where is it coming from?

00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:28.857
[TOWNSMAN O]
Sounds close!

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:31.297
[TOWNSMAN P] You don't think
it's a ghost, do you?

00:13:31.332 --> 00:13:37.483
[growling]

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:41.127
Who's there?
I shall seek you out!

00:13:42.465 --> 00:13:45.675
Huh? Wait! Could it be?

00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.617
Everybody, be quiet, please!

00:13:48.651 --> 00:13:54.868
[growling]

00:13:58.614 --> 00:14:00.418
Ah-ha!

00:14:00.452 --> 00:14:06.470
[growling]

00:14:30.743 --> 00:14:32.650
[SMILE OVERSEER C]
What are you lazy bugs doing?

00:14:32.683 --> 00:14:34.152
-[thud]
-[DWARF A groans]

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:38.499
Did you idiots
knock over this SAD tank?

00:14:38.534 --> 00:14:40.204
It's spilling everywhere!

00:14:40.237 --> 00:14:42.276
C'mon! Pick it up!

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:44.249
[DWARF A]
Are you okay?

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:45.319
It wasn't us!

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:46.858
There was an earthquake
out of the blue

00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:49.064
and then before we knew it,
the tank fell flat!

00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:50.334
[DWARF C]
We promise!

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:52.307
[DWARF D] Did something
cause that earthquake?

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.310
Shut your hole!

00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:55.015
You don't need to
worry about that stuff!

00:14:55.048 --> 00:14:57.121
-[DWARF D] But...
-Come on, guys!

00:14:57.155 --> 00:15:00.634
You wanna cure Princess
Mansherry's illness or not?

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.673
What if she dies? Huh?

00:15:02.706 --> 00:15:04.377
Of course we want to save her!

00:15:04.411 --> 00:15:07.887
How is she? We haven't
heard in a while!

00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:09.960
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.633
I'm sorry to say
that the princess

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:13.137
isn't getting any better at all!

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.474
[SMILE OVERSEER A]
Not at all!

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:16.881
[DWARVES]
What?!

00:15:21.394 --> 00:15:24.303
'Kay, guys.
Everybody ready to go?

00:15:24.337 --> 00:15:26.176
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:15:26.209 --> 00:15:28.482
Let's do it!

00:15:29.453 --> 00:15:32.360
Please, sir. Let us see
the princess, just once!

00:15:32.393 --> 00:15:34.902
[SMILE OVERSEER C]
You're such a little nuisance!

00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:37.711
Shut up and get to work!

00:15:37.744 --> 00:15:39.247
[CHAO groans]

00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:41.353
Huh?

00:15:44.531 --> 00:15:46.871
Those SMILES aren't
gonna make themselves,

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:50.013
so stop gawking or you're
all gonna get the whip!

00:15:54.695 --> 00:15:56.099
Are you listening to me?

00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:59.041
Am I not speaking loud
enough, you dimwits?

00:15:59.074 --> 00:16:02.116
Quit zoning out!
What's wrong with you?

00:16:04.122 --> 00:16:06.262
[DWARF A]
Those letters, they're--

00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:17.964
[CHAO]
The Pink Bees!

00:16:18.901 --> 00:16:20.370
[DWARF A]
Bian!

00:16:21.909 --> 00:16:24.049
[CHAO]
Inhel! Wicka!

00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.391
[DWARF C]
Bomba! Cotton!

00:16:34.615 --> 00:16:36.318
[DWARF E]
Our friends!

00:16:36.352 --> 00:16:38.594
[INHEL]
Good, they noticed us, Bian!

00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:40.800
Roger that! Okay, team.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.073
The next message!

00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:46.282
[whistle blows]

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.240
[DWARF A gasps]
"We got fooled"?

00:16:54.273 --> 00:16:55.945
[DWARF C]
I don't understand.

00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:57.382
[SMILE OVERSEER C]
If you won't listen,

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.455
I'm gonna make the
whip do the talking!

00:16:59.488 --> 00:17:01.360
[DWARF A]
Fooled about the princess?

00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:03.535
Fooled about her illness?

00:17:03.569 --> 00:17:07.345
[DWARF C] Doflamingo has been
lying to keep us trapped here?

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.538
[DWARVES]
"Fight"?

00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:19.315
All right, I got no choice
but to beat it into you!

00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:21.053
[DWARF A]
I don't know what's going on,

00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:22.993
but there's one
thing I'm sure of.

00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:25.066
[SMILE OVERSEER D yells]

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.872
My friends wouldn't lie!

00:17:26.905 --> 00:17:28.677
[SMILE OVERSEER C yells]

00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:31.786
-[CHAO] Shut up!
-[DWARF A] Underling!

00:17:36.031 --> 00:17:42.283
[DWARVES cheer]

00:17:47.465 --> 00:17:49.004
[ORLUMBUS]
Commodore Hug!

00:17:49.037 --> 00:17:52.849
Guff! With a capital G!

00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:57.998
[MACHVISE]
You got another one come-een!

00:17:58.031 --> 00:18:00.505
This one'll do you een for sure!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.946
Ten-Ton Vise!

00:18:02.979 --> 00:18:04.918
[SAI]
Are you okay?

00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:05.821
Hey, Grandpa?

00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:08.830
I'm fine! And hopping mad!

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:10.937
[GLADIUS]
Mine Pop.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.609
[CHIN JAO groans]

00:18:12.642 --> 00:18:15.784
[GLADIUS] Not safe there,
either. Over there, too.

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:18.693
[DELLINGER grunts]

00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:22.437
I won? Boring!

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.781
I wanted to see more of the
Long Leg Tribe's famous kicks.

00:18:25.815 --> 00:18:28.021
Real pity.

00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:29.826
[IDEO]
Destruction Cannon!

00:18:31.799 --> 00:18:32.969
Ideo?

00:18:33.003 --> 00:18:36.479
[DELLINGER laughs]
Too slow!

00:18:36.513 --> 00:18:38.117
You guys are hilarious!

00:18:38.151 --> 00:18:39.756
You should try
getting into comedy!

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.769
Hmph. Never mind getting there
first-- We gotta fight to win.

00:18:43.802 --> 00:18:44.872
Yeah.

00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:48.984
Armsmorphosis! Revolver Girl!

00:18:49.017 --> 00:18:50.253
[gasps]

00:18:50.287 --> 00:18:55.468
[ELIZABELLO yells]
Lite version, King Punch!

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.720
Dagama. If we don't
figure out something quick,

00:19:00.753 --> 00:19:02.624
we're gonna lose!

00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:09.679
[LUFFY yelling]

00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:15.865
It's Straw Hat!

00:19:15.898 --> 00:19:18.405
[yells]

00:19:18.438 --> 00:19:22.752
[DAGAMA] Time to show my genius
as a military tactician!

00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:26.697
Doflamingo's up at the
top of this place, right?

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.706
Cabbage! You trying
to get in my way again?

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.283
[CAVENDISH]
Not this time. Hop on.

00:19:33.316 --> 00:19:34.352
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:19:34.385 --> 00:19:35.455
[CAVENDISH]
Not my first choice,

00:19:35.489 --> 00:19:37.295
but I've decided
to give you a ride.

00:19:37.328 --> 00:19:38.665
Are you serious?

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.274
You need to get to Doflamingo
quickly, don't you?

00:19:41.307 --> 00:19:44.349
[LUFFY] All right!
Let's get going! Ride!

00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:47.058
Would a small hint of
gratitude kill you?

00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:48.261
Just make the horse go!

00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:51.470
Don't tell me what
to do! Let's go, Farul.

00:19:51.504 --> 00:19:52.809
[FARUL neighs]

00:19:52.842 --> 00:19:54.547
[CAVENDISH] Listen,
if the Executives catch us,

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.486
we'll be stuck here for ages.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.559
I'll cut through the wall
and make a path.

00:19:58.592 --> 00:20:00.397
You knock the enemies
out of our way.

00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:01.903
[LUFFY]
Got it!

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:03.674
[CAVENDISH] We'll push through
to the third level in one shot.

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:06.449
Hey! When the hell did we
pick up an extra passenger?

00:20:06.482 --> 00:20:07.686
Oh, hey, Soldier.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.824
[CAVENDISH]
What are you doing on my horse?

00:20:08.857 --> 00:20:10.930
Riding. I followed
Luffyland's trail

00:20:10.963 --> 00:20:12.267
and it brought me here.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.637
I see.

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:15.944
That's only logical,
since he was clearing a path.

00:20:15.977 --> 00:20:17.515
Wait! Get off!

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.688
Lucky break!
I was looking for you!

00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:22.598
I don't care if you're friends--
Four's too many!

00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:25.639
We're gonna meet up with
Rebecca after we go up a level.

00:20:25.673 --> 00:20:29.150
Rebecca's in enemy territory?
You didn't stop her?

00:20:29.183 --> 00:20:30.555
Don't ignore me!

00:20:30.588 --> 00:20:32.427
She's headed up the to
the Sunflower Field

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.664
to deliver a key to me.

00:20:33.697 --> 00:20:35.202
But she's on the wanted list--

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:36.773
What if somebody captures her?

00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:38.913
[LUFFY] Don't worry! My friends
are there to protect her.

00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.487
[CAVENDISH] Listen,
my elegant steed can't maintain

00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:43.995
its elegance with four
people on its back!

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:47.071
[LAW] It was more comfortable
riding on the bull.

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:50.715
By the way, Pops, why did you
take off in such a hurry before?

00:20:50.748 --> 00:20:52.922
My goal in this is
the same as yours.

00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:56.633
I must liberate this kingdom
and beat Doflamingo

00:20:56.666 --> 00:20:59.374
as swiftly as possible!

00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:00.812
But there's one more thing.

00:21:00.846 --> 00:21:02.852
A personal matter
that I must settle.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:06.729
A Top Executive that I must
kill with my own two hands.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:10.440
That's fine. But don't
die trying, okay?

00:21:10.473 --> 00:21:11.611
[KYROS]
Of course not!

00:21:11.645 --> 00:21:13.885
I won't be defeated
with my true body!

00:21:13.918 --> 00:21:14.720
Okay, then!

00:21:14.753 --> 00:21:16.192
Not okay. Get off!

00:21:16.225 --> 00:21:17.629
Why don't you get off?

00:21:17.662 --> 00:21:18.933
This is my horse!

00:21:18.967 --> 00:21:21.741
You're the worst of the
whole Worst Generation!

00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:23.380
Watch where you're going!

00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:24.985
We're gonna crash! Look!

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:28.227
[CAVENDISH] Like I said,
don't tell me what to do!

00:21:30.433 --> 00:21:32.239
-Huh?
-What's that?

00:21:32.272 --> 00:21:33.375
[KYROS]
Huh?

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:54.372
We've got this! Go on ahead!

00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:58.017
We'll keep 'em busy,
Straw Hat--don't worry!

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.227
They're a team
all of a sudd-een!

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.462
They were one step away from

00:22:02.496 --> 00:22:04.069
fighting each other
a second ago!

00:22:04.102 --> 00:22:06.542
[LUFFY] That's cool,
but what's going on here?

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:07.913
You're friends, now?

00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:12.426
[laughs] I'm a famous
tactician! And this is war!

00:22:12.459 --> 00:22:16.941
I helped them realize we need
each other to grasp victory!

00:22:17.877 --> 00:22:21.053
Dagama may be a rat,
but his plan makes sense.

00:22:21.087 --> 00:22:23.694
Our best bet is to
help Straw Hat win.

00:22:23.727 --> 00:22:24.763
So get moving!

00:22:24.796 --> 00:22:26.401
[HAJRUDIN]
You take out the boss,

00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:28.274
we'll keep the Executives busy!

00:22:28.308 --> 00:22:31.283
Get him there, Cavendish,
and make it quick!

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:34.527
I see. So I've been
reduced to a chauffeur!

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.097
Don't give 'em an inch!

00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:38.237
You ready?

00:22:40.644 --> 00:22:43.218
[FARUL neighs]

00:23:01.473 --> 00:23:07.859
[LUFFY laughs] This is
getting fun! Let's go!

00:23:15.048 --> 00:23:16.920
[NARRATOR] The motley crew
of fighters allows Luffy

00:23:16.953 --> 00:23:18.457
to advance towards the palace.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.433
Meanwhile, Kin'emon reunites
with his long-lost friend,

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:24.643
Kanjuro, another Samurai
from the Land of Wano.

00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:27.451
As the duo plans an escape
from the underground junkyard,

00:23:27.484 --> 00:23:31.831
Kanjuro uses a strange power
that truly defies explanation!

00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:33.804
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.838 --> 00:23:35.275
"The Second Samurai!

00:23:35.308 --> 00:23:38.117
Evening Shower
Kanjuro Appears!"

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.591
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
