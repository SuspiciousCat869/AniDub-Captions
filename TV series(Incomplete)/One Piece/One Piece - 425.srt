00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,179
And what is this
thing chasing us?

176
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,648
From the looks of it,
I'd say it's the rarest kind

177
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:54,552
of monster in existence.
A snake born from a chicken egg.

178
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:55,920
A Basilisk!

179
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,057
[LUFFY] That thing
came out of a chicken?

180
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,993
[BUGGY] I said it was
a monster, didn't I?

181
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,694
These things shouldn't
even be allowed to live,

182
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,329
let alone run free!
They eat people like snacks,

183
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:08,232
So they locked 'em up here where
they can only eat criminals!

184

00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,373
It's Straw Hat Luffy!

197
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,008

[SKINNY GUARD]
What was that? What happened?

207
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:12,196
Aw crap. This cannot be good.

208
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:20,805
It's getting hot.

209
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,641
[DOMINO] Well, as the
Vice Warden told you before,

210
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,976
the Warden's office
is located on Level 4,

211
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,012
which is known as
the Burning Heat Floor.

212
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:31,916
Aside from his office,
the whole floor is an inferno.

213
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,218
There. We've finally arrived.

214
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,022
[MOMONGA]
Well, where is he?

215
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:39,356
Where is this Warden?

216
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,558
[DOMINO]
Warden Magellan suffers from

217
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:43,294
terrible digestive problems,
so he stays in the bathroom

218
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,297
an average of 10 hours
a day, seven days a week.

219
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,933
Of course, he sleeps
about 8 hours each night.

220
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,001
So once you factor in
mealtimes and breaks

221
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:53,003
he only works about
four hours a day.

222
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,306
Is that really enough
time to do his job?

223
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,008
When the need arises,
he's the right man.

224
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:01,278
Oh. We're in luck.
Sounds like he's coming out.

225
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:03,114
And I forgot to
mention it before,

226
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,915
but the Warden ate
the Venom-Venom Fruit.

227
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:06,083
So he's a poison man.

228
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:07,351
Poison man?

229
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:09,720
[DOMINO]
Yes. Please, be careful.

230
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,300
[GUARDS]
Excellent work, Warden.

231
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:26,270
[GUARD 425F] You showed those
bowels who's boss, sir.

232
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:30,241

233

[MAGELLAN] As always,
it was a rough battle in there!

234
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,745
You must be our guests.

235
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,114
I'm Magellan, the Warden here.

236
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,986
[MAGELLAN]
This room is too bright!

237
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:44,155
For the record,
I much prefer places

238
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:47,258
that are dark, cold, and
closed off. Just like my heart.

239
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,126
[HANNYABAL]
Stop being ridiculous.

240
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,127
Now, listen.

241
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,897
Vice Admiral Momonga and
the Warlord Boa Hancock

242
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,365
are here on important business.

243
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,901
And our time is short,
Warden Magellan.

244
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:58,469
[MAGELLAN]
Ah! My apologies!

245
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:01,205
I have a bad case of
the runs, I'm afraid.

246
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,307
The poison soup I had for
breakfast this morning

247
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,375
isn't quite agreeing with me.

248
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,811
[HANNYABAL] Well, what do
you expect? It's poison!

249
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:10,014
Oh, come on-- I'm a
poison man! I love poison!

250
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:11,949
It's just like
the old saying goes.

251
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,851
"Poison kills poison" I believe?

252
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:16,220
[HANNYABAL] Well, that's why
you have venomous diarrhea.

253
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,888
Yes, and I'm afraid that you

254
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,390
have a venomous
tongue, Hannyabal.

255
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,059
[HANNYABAL] Hurry up and retire
so I can become Warden.

256
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,094
Oopsie! I mean, uh, please hurry

257
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,197
and show our guests
to "Fire Fist".

Yeah, right!

259
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,333

slip of the tongue!

260
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,802
It saddens my heart to
know that my colleague

261
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:34,171
thinks so little of me.

262
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:35,139
[HANNYABAL groans]

263
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:36,907

be careful when you exhale!

could we possibly allow this?

They're for these
cuffs and the doors!

345
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:51,360
[PRISONER 425H]
They're right there!

346
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,496
See them? Over there
on the ground!

347
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,298
[PRISONER 425I]
What's he doing?

348
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:58,367
C'mon! We gotta get goin'!

349
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,868
Don't be in such a rush!

350
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,604
We're supposed to be
saving my brother!

351
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:04,339
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

352
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,475
What is he doing down here?

353
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,944
[MR. 3] He's not in a cell,
nor in a prison uniform.

354
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,547
And it looks like he's
on his way out of here.

355
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,849
Alright! An opportunity
like this one

356
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,618
simply won't happen again!
It's now or never!

357
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:17,920
As much as I thought otherwise,

358
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,390
it seems heaven hasn't
forsaken me just yet!

359
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:25,360
[BUGGY] Heh. Hey, boys!
Is this what you're looking for?

360
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,362
[PRISONERS cheer]

361
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:28,964
[PRISONERS]
Yeah, that's it! That's it!

362
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,933
--Give it to me!
--Let us outta here!

363
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,370
Hm? Now is that any way
to ask someone for a favor?

364
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,940
[PRISONERS]
We're sorry! We're begging you!

365
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,009
That was inexcusable!
We apologize!

366
00:17:41,043 --> 00:17:44,813
[BUGGY] Hm? What was that?
I couldn't hear you.

367
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,249
[LUFFY] Yes, you could.
What the heck are you doing?

368
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,984
[PRISONERS]
Please, sir!

369
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,686
[BUGGY]
Alright! You got it!

370
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,788
One set of keys,
coming right up!

371
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:57,993
Complements of Captain Buggy!
Accept it with gratitude!

372
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,596
[PRISONERS cheering]

373
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,898
[PRISONER]
We're free! We're free!

374
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:05,667
We're finally out
of those damn cells!

375
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:11,540
[PRISONERS clamoring]

376
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:14,843
[BUGGY cackles]
That's right! Now I ask you.

377
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:16,478
What's the glorious
name of the man

378
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,013
who has given you
your sweet freedom?

379
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,515
[PRISONER 425J]
It's Captain Buggy!

380
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,283
And we're in your debt forever!

381
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,785
[PRISONER 425K] Anybody
talking bad about Buggy's

382
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:23,786
gonna answer to us!

383
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,656
[BUGGY cackles]
That's me! And don't you scum

384
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,659
ever forget it! Now!
Unlock the other cells!

385
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,693
Set everyone free!

386
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:32,961
[PRISONERS cheer]

387
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,831
[BUGGY] Once these morons start
wreaking havoc on this place,

388
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,934
I'll finally have a chance
to sneak out on my own!

389
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,836
[BUGGY groans] Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

390
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,372
[LUFFY] You done?
Good! Then it's my turn!

391
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:46,608
Back to the plan! Lead me
down to the next level!

392
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:49,378
Isn't there a hole like
last time, or something?

393
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,647
[BUGGY] How should I know?
This place is like a maze!

394
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,049
You expect me to remember
the details of every floor?

395
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:56,552
Find your own damned
way to Level 3!

396
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:58,353
[PRISONERS laughing]

397
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,489
[PRISONER 425L] Thanks for
everything, Captain Buggy!

398
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:03,425
[PRISONER 425M]
I can smell freedom already!

399
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,629
[MONSTERS growling]

400
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,064
[PRISONERS gasp]

401
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,468
[PRISONERS scream]

402
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:16,371
[BUGGY grumbling]
Stop it, Straw Hat! Put me down!

403
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,472
[LUFFY]
Why should I?

404
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,675
You said you'd lead me
all the way down to Level 4,

405
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:20,776
and now you're gonna do it!

406
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,678
[BUGGY] I lied, okay?
I just wanted the treasure,

407
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,381
so I lied to get it!
With all those prisoners free,

408
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,651
the chaos will be immeasurable!
And when that happens, I'll--

409
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,920
Wait, what was that? You lied?

410
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:34,423
[BUGGY laughs]

411
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,391
[footsteps]

412
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,827
[PRISONERS screaming]

413
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:41,730
[LUFFY, BUGGY yelp]

414
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:47,569
[PRISONERS screaming]

415
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,671
[BUGGY] What are you
idiots doing? You're free!

416
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:52,007
This is your chance to raise
hell and get outta here!

417
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,377
We, uh. We just remembered
why we never tried to do that.

418
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,812
Escape is impossible.

419
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,981
Especially with those wild
beasts running around.

420
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,682
Yeah. Dying is for the birds.

421
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:01,850
We're way better
off in this cell.

422
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:05,120
[BUGGY screams] Okay! I've
changed my mind, Straw Hat.

423
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:07,089
I'll show you the way
to Level 3. Let's go!

424
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,190
What?

425
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,826
But you just said you didn't
know the way, Big Nose!

426
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,395
My nose is perfect! How rude!

427
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:15,063
[MR. 3] I couldn't help
but overhear you.

428
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:18,533
If you're having trouble
on this floor, I can help.

429
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,535
[BUGGY]
Is that so. Who're you?

430
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:24,106
[MR. 3 laughs] Long time
no see, Straw Hat Luffy!

431
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,441
You helped me out
without noticing.

432
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,409
How fortunate.

433
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:30,545
I am a man who always
pays back his debts.

434
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,814
[LUFFY] Do I know you?
[MR. 3 gasps]

435
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:35,984
Wait! It's the "3" hair!

436
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,986
Holy Crap! Look at his hair!

437
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,588
[MR. 3]
You just shut up!

438
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,590
It's a three! And, it's on fire!

439
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,558
Candle Lock!

440
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,596
Oh yeah! This should be perfect!

441
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:49,998
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

442
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:51,967
Mallet!

443
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:58,507
[MR. 3 laughing] Why, just a
little game of hide and seek.

444
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,043
Can you figure out
which one is me?

445
00:21:01,076 --> 00:21:04,079
You're just another buffoon
who acts on blind instinct

446
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:07,082
and uses brute force
to solve all his problems.

447
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,884
I am a Baroque Works agent.

448
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,652
Every assignment
that is given to me

449
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,054
I see through to its end.

450
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:13,822
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

451
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,957
Stamp!

452
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,592
[MR. 3 groaning]

453
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:21,897
How'd you know
which one was me?

454
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,001
Hunch.

455
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:29,972
Oh, yeah! You were on the island
with the giants, right? Three!

456
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:32,240
[MR. 3]
Mister Three, you fool!

457
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:38,747
[MR. 3 laughing]

458
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,050
[MARINE 425A]
Fleet Admiral!

459
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:44,686
We've just received an emergency
report from Impel Down!

460
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,989
[SENGOKU]
Huh? What's going on now?

461
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:48,957
Tell me! Is it Whitebeard?

462
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:49,925
[MARINE 425A]
No, sir.

463
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,960
Straw Hat Luffy has
infiltrated the prison.

464
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,962
[SENGOKU]
What? Straw Hat?

465
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,597
What is he doing there?

466
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,699
I thought Bartholomew Kuma
had taken care of

467
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,934
that little troublemaker!

468
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,837
Yes. That's the same report
that I had heard as well, sir.

469
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,573
But what bothers me
even more is why a pirate

470
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:06,541
would sneak into Impel Down.

471
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,578
Do you have any clue
what he might be planning?

472
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:10,746
[MARINE 425A]
Sir?

473
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:12,280
Well, regardless of
what Straw Hat's

474
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:15,851
got up his sleeve, it's the end
of the road for him this time.

475
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:19,087
That is to say, he picked
the wrong place to break into.

476
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:26,128
[SENGOKU]
Impel Down has successfully held

477
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,830
hundreds of thousands of
criminals over the years.

478
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,932
Many of them notorious
pirates with powers

479
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,135
as fearsome as
their reputations.

480
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:35,137
Their defenses are legendary
and they're prepared

481
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,073
for almost any situation.

482
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,208
[SENGOKU] Of course, it was
the guard's incompetence

483
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,010
that allowed him to enter.

484
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,912
But either way,
Straw Hat will never

485
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:48,950
leave that place alive.
Only one man has.

486
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,252
[MARINE 425A]
Really?

487
00:22:51,853 --> 00:22:53,321
20 long years ago.

488
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,290
He became the first
and only person.

489
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:58,593
In the history of
Impel Down to escape.

490
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,130
A pirate named Shiki,
the Golden Lion.

491
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:05,667
[MARINE 425A]
Shiki? The Golden Lion...

492
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,310
[NARRATOR]
In the history of Impel Down,

493
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:18,847
only one man has ever managed
to escape from its walls.

494
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,616
His name is Shiki,
the Golden Lion.

495
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,219
20 years later, in what
we now know as the present,

496
00:23:24,252 --> 00:23:26,922
the Straw Hats encounter a giant
beetle and find themselves

497
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:29,191
wrapped up in Shiki's plans.

498
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,959
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

499
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,762
A Special Presentation
Related to the Movie:

500
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,131
A Gold Lion's
Ambition on the Move.

501
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
