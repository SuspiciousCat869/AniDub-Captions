Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26

All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

them dyes your heart

[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,436
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,739
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:47,609
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:50,445
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,180
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,149
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,819
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,454
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,155
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,260
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

Now this is exciting!

I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,402
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51

the Grand Line to the New World!

52

[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

53
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:27,649
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:32,220
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison Impel Down,

55
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,856
Now at Level 4,
the Burning Heat Hell,

56
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,325
Warden Magellan
has ambushed him.

[MAGELLAN]
And one final thing,

58
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,531
I will find out exactly how
you broke into my prison.

59
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:47,569
You will spill every last,
juicy detail to me.

60

I'll die before I say a word.

You can't fight him!

it'll be the last thing you do!

There's no escape.
You have already been condemned.

What a waste.

That guy!

It's Mister 2!

I'm quite persistent.

[MAGELLAN] You just
don't know when to quit.

The sooner you stop
this nonsense,

Wanna do a condemned
man a favor?

Tell me, is something happening
on the upper levels?

This is pointless. Hopeless!
You have no right!

253
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:07,180
Your brother is
a notorious criminal

254
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:10,951
who will face his execution,
and rightfully so.

255
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,587
You are an intruder
who has waged open war

256

on the World Government.

257
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,662
You've wronged this world
and you must pay.

258
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:24,831
The law demands
Ace's death in Marineford,

259

and so it shall have it.

260
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,836
Do not mistake
your misguided attempt

at rescuing him for justice!

Consider this
your punishment, child.

287
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,005
There's no way to neutralize
the amount of poison

288
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,207
your body has absorbed.

289
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,411
You will suffer
in agonizing pain for 24 hours,

290
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:55,649
and then you will die.
This is true hell.

After losing to Magellan,

Luffy's imprisoned on Level 5.

00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:21,241
Even though he knows
the warden's poison has no cure.

297

Bon Clay rushes to his friend's
aid, betting on a distant hope.

298
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,947
However, before
he can reach him,

299
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,883
a pack of Army Wolves
blocks his advance.

300
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,418
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

301
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,122
"For His Friend! Bon Clay's
Deadly Rescue Attempt."

302
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:37,424
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
