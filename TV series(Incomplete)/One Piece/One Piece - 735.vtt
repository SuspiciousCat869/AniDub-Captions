00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.463
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.276
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:52.979
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.384
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.557
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.498
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.101
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.243
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:12.552
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.031
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.704
and launched an attack
on the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:24.475
who had a firm grip on
the Kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:26.513
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.216
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.320
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.324
until at last...

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:38.336
[yelling]

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.437
Look to the sky, Dressrosa!

[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:12.638

The Birdcage is gone.

00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:18.015
[GYATS]
The winner is...

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:20.855
...Lucy!

00:04:20.955 --> 00:04:25.598

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:36.418
[crying]

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.883
Lucy.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.435
[LUFFY]
"The Unheard-of!

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:04.576

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:20.741
Yeah!

00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:22.044
All right!

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:24.281
He really took down
Doflamingo! Aww yeah!

00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:26.252
We have freedom in Dressrosa!

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.189
He took care of the bad man!

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.965
That's right! We're free! [sobs]

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.237
Oh, Gyats!

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:39.378
I'm fine. What matters is...

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:41.984
...Lucy pulled off
a miracle for us!

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:45.591
Doflamingo's reign
of terror is over!

00:05:46.594 --> 00:05:47.795
Cuh-lick.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:11.476
[BURGESS panting]

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:13.279
Where d'you think you're going?

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.317
Aren't ya gonna finish me off?

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:16.352
[SABO]
No need.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:17.889
[BURGESS]
Huh?

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.160
Think we're just about
good here, don't you?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.440
[chuckles] You brothers
are a buncha softies.

00:06:28.944 --> 00:06:35.724
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B ringing]

00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:43.707
You wanna hear what Ace said

00:06:43.807 --> 00:06:46.847
right before we handed
his ass over to the Navy?

00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:50.353
It was after our captain
thrashed him on Banaro Island.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:51.957
I'll tell ya.

00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:56.298
[REVOLUTIONARY A]
Hey, hurry it up!

00:06:56.398 --> 00:06:58.603
The clash between Straw Hat
and Doflamingo's over!

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.306
The Navy's gonna
be on their way!

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:01.843
I know, stop!

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.479
[REVOLUTIONARY A]
Did you contact the chief?

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.450
Not yet! I've been trying to.

00:07:05.552 --> 00:07:07.020
[ringing]

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.657
[REVOLUTIONARY A]
He's not picking up.

00:07:08.757 --> 00:07:09.659
[REVOLUTIONARY B]
He only answers when

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.928
he's feeling chatty.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:18.710
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C ringing]

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:28.229
[chuckles] I think you'll
get a real kick outta this!

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:34.876
[chuckling]

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.882
Once he realized he
was gonna get executed,

00:07:37.982 --> 00:07:41.221
and I remember it
clearly. He said...

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.267
[ACE]
Don't tell my brother.

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:54.315
[chuckles] What a dumbass!

00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:58.524
He had no idea just how much
weight his name carried!

00:07:58.624 --> 00:08:00.193
[BURGESS chuckles]

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:02.898
What a naive moron that kid was.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:05.838
Of course, the Navy
would run with that story.

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:09.946
"Heroically, they brought the
vile Fire Fist Ace to justice!"

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:20.299
That's enough. Shut your mouth.

00:08:24.342 --> 00:08:28.717
Bastard. All I can think about
are his final moments.

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.765
It has haunted me
every single night

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.035
since the day that he died.

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:42.945
[SABO] You don't have to tell me
because I already know.

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:55.036
[BURGESS]
That's right! Lose your cool!

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:58.977
I won't let that Devil Fruit
slip out of my grasp this time!

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:02.819
I'd be a disgrace to my crew
if I came back empty handed!

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:06.025
I'll be taking it
one way or another!

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.398
[BURGESS] Sounds like you're
full of regret, huh?

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.437
What'd all that status
and power get you in the end?

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:15.711
You couldn't even use it
to save your own brother!

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.282
Where the hell were ya
when it all went down?

00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:22.323
Were you catching some z's
or something? [chuckles]

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:24.863
You weren't there for him
when he needed you most,

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:28.269
yet you called yourself
family! Pathetic!

00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:33.279
[BURGESS cackles]

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:36.118
I will not be weighed down
by regrets any longer!

00:09:39.726 --> 00:09:41.161
Fire Fist!

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:43.633
Dammit!

00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:51.114
[BURGESS screams]

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:04.374
[BURGESS screams]

00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:14.327
I was gonna leave ya, but Ace
here said you deserved it.

00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:21.008
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C ringing]

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:22.545
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C]
Cuh-lick.

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:26.118
Oh! Hello, Sabo?
Where are you right now?

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:29.090
I noticed that Burgess
was heading towards Luffy!

00:10:29.592 --> 00:10:31.563
Figured you'd like to
know that tidbit of info,

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.800
so I've been trying to call you!

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.571
[SABO]
Yeah? Well, who cares?

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.241
[KOALA]
What?

00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:38.844
[SABO] Don't worry. I took
care of that ape already.

00:10:38.944 --> 00:10:40.515
[KOALA]
Huh?

00:10:40.615 --> 00:10:43.019
Anyway, did you happen to
find the list yet, Koala?

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:44.789
[KOALA]
Ugh! Yes, I did!

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.459
Cool. Let's call
the ship and head b--

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.162
[KOALA]
Already did!

00:10:48.262 --> 00:10:50.133
[SABO] Fine. Let's meet up
with Hack underground then.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.905
[KOALA] I'm with him!
We're waiting on you!

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:53.840
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL C]
Cuh-lick.

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:05.130
Did that jackass just
hang up on me?

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.801
Please don't take it
out on me, Miss Koala!

00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:19.926
[MARINE A]
Over here!

00:11:23.232 --> 00:11:25.704
[MARINE B] We've found
the Don Quixote Family!

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.738
[MARINE B] We've got eight
Executives. And, I think...

00:11:49.318 --> 00:11:51.488
[MARINE B]
Yes! The top three as well!

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:56.365
[MARINE C]
Take caution!

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:59.204
We believe most of them
have Devil Fruit Powers!

00:12:02.878 --> 00:12:05.417
[MARINE C] Use Sea Prism
Stone just in case!

00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:06.485

Yes, sir!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.136
It's surreal to see
a pirate group

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:17.709
of their reputation taken down.

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:21.415
[BABY 5]
Good work. My darling.

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:22.685

Okay.

Whoa! What do you think
you're doing? Get off me!

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:47.367
Distance yourself,
woman! Right now!

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.620
Do you know if we called HQ yet?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.156
Where are they?

00:12:58.256 --> 00:13:01.730
[MARINE E]
Well, actually. Not yet.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.499
Issho instructed us
to delay a bit.

We are now.

at the nearby Applenine Island.

[APPLENINE C] I heard it's a
transmission from Dressrosa!

00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:05.877

from King Doflamingo.

the current state of Dressrosa!

00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:00.988
What happened there?

I'm sure you're all surprised,

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:05.496
but we must spread
the harrowing tale,

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.937
and tell of the actions
that transpired here!

Keep calm and listen carefully.

I will detail the events that
took place this afternoon

00:16:14.581 --> 00:16:18.088
involving the Warlord,
Doflamingo. Ready?

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:23.198

Issho. I hope you are.

We are begging you, King Riku!

00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:32.818
It took some time
for the truth to get out.

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:35.858
As mute toys, we were
unable to speak up!

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.628
We all know you were controlled!

00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:40.667
Doflamingo forced you to commit
all of those violent acts!

Nobody blames you!

Even with the
misunderstanding absolved,

I cannot return to the throne.

ruler worthy to lead Dressrosa!

He's right!

all this violence!

Please, King Riku!

00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:15.035
We share your vision of a
peaceful future! We beg you!

00:17:15.737 --> 00:17:17.908
[TOWNSMAN J] We want to go back
to when times were calm!

00:17:18.008 --> 00:17:21.214
That's something all the money
in the world can't buy!

00:17:21.314 --> 00:17:24.755
Your Majesty!
You have to reconsider!

00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:30.734
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.942
[DOLDO]
Hold your pleas.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:36.111
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:40.320
Under pressure,
the Riku Family ideals shatter.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.760
Has that not been proven by now?

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:51.475
[TOWNSMAN K]
We don't care if we fall!

00:17:52.176 --> 00:17:53.947
For the chance at being
a bloodless nation,

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.416
we're happy to risk it!

00:17:55.517 --> 00:17:57.320
We want a king
who will resist wars!

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.257
And we know you're
the man for the job!

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:00.894
That's right.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:04.400
Even if it results in failure,
we'll take that chance!

00:18:05.804 --> 00:18:07.474
Who cares if we're poor!

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:10.781
Just make Dressrosa a peaceful
kingdom like we used to be!

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.283
Please, King Riku!

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.955
Listen to the cries
of your people!

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:22.103
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:18:28.248 --> 00:18:30.285
There's no one better
suited to lead us!

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.802
[ELIZABELLO laughs]

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:40.607
As the "Fighting King,"
I'm not used to this.

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:43.412
Elizabello!

00:18:45.116 --> 00:18:48.222
[GUARD A] King Riku! Please
return to the palace at once!

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:49.558
There's a bunch of
incoming calls

00:18:49.658 --> 00:18:51.194
from our neighboring nations!

00:18:51.294 --> 00:18:52.396
They'd like to talk!

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.502
But, to me?

00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:58.008
[ELIZABELLO laughs]
Well, I took it upon myself

00:18:58.108 --> 00:18:59.812
to get the word out to people.

00:18:59.913 --> 00:19:02.450
When I told them King Riku
would be returning,

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.223
they all seemed overjoyed.

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:06.392
[GUARD A]
The king of Prodence?

00:19:06.492 --> 00:19:09.264
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:19:09.364 --> 00:19:10.567
Surely you haven't
changed that much

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.437
in a mere decade, my friends.

00:19:12.538 --> 00:19:14.441
What happened to the old you?

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.613
The man who'd give
a firm stink-eye to anyone

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:19.384
even thinking about
waging war, huh?

00:19:21.689 --> 00:19:23.659
[ELIZABELLO]
They're all waiting on him.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:29.004
Come back to the throne.

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:33.513
King of Miracles,
Riku Doldo the Third!

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:37.286
[FUJITORA] You friend's
a smart man there, King Riku.

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.722
[APPLENINE murmuring]

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:55.990
The Navy Admiral!

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:05.376
This entire mess is
Doflamingo's doing.

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:08.182
I would hate to see you shoulder
the responsibility alone

00:20:08.282 --> 00:20:10.352
for the error in his judgment.

00:20:10.887 --> 00:20:13.359
That crooked pirate
was unfit to rule,

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:14.895
but thanks to a
broken arrangement

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:16.365
with bunch of convicts,

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:18.669
the Seven Warlord
System failed you.

00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:21.341
Sadly, Dressrosa was
forced to pay this price

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:23.179
by the blood-stained hands

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:25.950
of us! The World Government.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.029
[FUJITORA]
People of the kingdom,

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.672
and members of the royal family.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.067
[FUJITORA]
On behalf of the Government,

00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:56.879
allow me to offer my
most humble of apologies.

00:21:04.194 --> 00:21:06.866
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:21:06.966 --> 00:21:13.311
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:21:22.764 --> 00:21:27.373
With deep regret, we've done
you a terrible disservice.

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:31.080
What's this about?

00:21:39.565 --> 00:21:41.736
[APPLENINE gasps]

00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:45.176
Admiral Issho's
actually kneeling?

00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:46.779
[ISLANDER D]
I'm shocked!

00:21:49.952 --> 00:21:51.522
[ISLANDER E]
Now, this is wild!

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:53.593
The Navy works directly
under the Government

00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:56.298
and one of their highly
respected officials

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:59.437
is on the ground
apologizing to King Riku!

00:21:59.538 --> 00:22:01.876
What happened over
there in Dressrosa?

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:06.285
The fall of the "Heavenly Demon"
was due to some pirate alliance?

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:09.525
Take notes!
Don't miss any details!

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:12.363
I've never seen anything
like this before!

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:18.242
[NARRATOR] The false prosperity
of the mighty Dressrosa,

00:22:18.342 --> 00:22:20.947
the unsavory secrets
that they held,

00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:23.919
the downfall of
Don Quixote Doflamingo,

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.494
the world's most notorious
Black-Market Broker,

00:22:27.595 --> 00:22:29.699
and the Navy HQ
Admiral Fujitora's

00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:31.702
heartfelt prostration.

00:22:50.239 --> 00:22:52.143
[NARRATOR] All of these
truths have been freed

00:22:52.243 --> 00:22:54.046
from the Birdcage.

00:22:57.755 --> 00:22:59.558
[NARRATOR]
And for better or worse,

00:22:59.658 --> 00:23:04.033
they have been unleashed
upon the entire world.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.091
[NARRATOR] Admiral Fujitora's
humbling gesture

00:23:16.191 --> 00:23:17.994
sends ripples
throughout the world.

00:23:18.094 --> 00:23:19.998
But that's not
the only breaking story.

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:22.437
Luffy and Law's defeat of
the infamous Doflamingo

00:23:22.538 --> 00:23:24.074
is also causing
quite a commotion.

00:23:24.174 --> 00:23:25.442
When word reaches
the other members

00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:27.012
of the Worst Generation,

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:29.350
they make their own plans
to topple the Emperors.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.054
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.154 --> 00:23:32.524
"Sending a Shock Wave!

00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:34.962
The Worst Generation
Goes Into Action!"

00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:37.968
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
