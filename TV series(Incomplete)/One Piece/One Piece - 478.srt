00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,790
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,527
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,128
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,097
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,665
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,402
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,103
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,073
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,876
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,511
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,079
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:03,250
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,852
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,189
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,392
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:17,130
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,270
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,606
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,941
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,944
With Jimbei's help,
he cleared the encircling walls

21
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,546
and inched closer
to the scaffold.

22
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,149
He continues his
progress towards Ace

23
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,320
as the battle between the
Whitebeard Pirates and Navy

24
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,723
rages on in the plaza!

25
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:46,560
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

26
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,931
Son of a--[groans]

27
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,969
The ravages of time
humble us all.

28
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,004
Yes, even you.

29
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,841
Screw the fight,
this is what I was afraid of!

30
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:06,046
[KIZARU] Huh. Wouldn't turn
your back on me, if I were you.

31
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,415
[MARCO groans]

32
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,915
Marco!

33
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,486
You gonna make the same mistake?

34
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,956
[JOZU groaning]

35
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,425
[AKAINU]
Someone has to see you off.

36
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,062
And that duty seems
to have fallen on me.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,363
[AKAINU grunts]

38
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,932
[WHITEBEARD groans]

39
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,601
Pops, no!

40
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,438
[LUFFY grunts]

41
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,642
[LUFFY panting]

42
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,244
[LUFFY] As long as I
do everything I can,

43
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,948
I don't care if I die.

44
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,518
I'm begging you,
you have to let me fight!

45
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,421
If I don't keep fighting...

46
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,491
...and they kill Ace 'cause
I wasn't there for him...

47
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,095
...then I'd rather
be dead anyway!

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,330
[IVANKOV gasps]

49
00:04:56,363 --> 00:05:00,467
Right now is the only fight
that matters--live or die!

50
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,506
Oh, fine!

51
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,178
It's your life!
Give us a good show!

52
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,880
[groans]

53
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,221
[yelling]

54
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,922
Luffy.

55
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:26,860
[LUFFY]
Ace!

00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,698
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

57
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,000
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

58
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,474
[groans] This is ridiculous!

59
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,644
What could possibly
take so long?

60
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,913
[MARINE A] I'm back, sir,
sorry for the wait!

61
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,581
These two replacements
should be able to

62
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,416
carry out the execution, sir.

63
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,052
All right, fine!
Hurry and get up here then!

64
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,053
Right!

65
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,457
[IVANKOV]
Remember, Straw Boy.

66
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,226
Energy Hormone may
get you pumped for now,

67
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,361
but if you fall
again, that's it!

68
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,730
You're a dead boy! Got it?

69
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,367
Energy Hormone only
tricks your body

70
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,969
into thinking you're okay!

71
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,872
It's not actually healing
your injuries at all!

72
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,576
[LUFFY panting]

73
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,244
That's all right.

74
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,915
In that case...

75
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,687
[LUFFY]
...I just won't fall again!

76
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,459
Huh? Well don't kill
yourself too badly.

77
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,660
Crap! It's happening!

78
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,668
Hold on a sec!

79
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,304
They're not executing
Ace while I'm around!

80
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,705
The kid's crazy.

81
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,741
But it isn't like he's
going to change his mind

82
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,810
under these circumstances!

83
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,280
Guess I might as well
give him some backup, then.

84
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,516
Hold on, Straw Boy,
Iva's coming for you!

85
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,751
He's over there!

86
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,820
[MARINE AA]
Straw Hat's still alive!

87
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,855
Not for long he's not!

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,299
Move it. I've got him!

[LUFFY groaning]

93
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,240
[MARINE G grunts]
I'll finish him off!

[MARINE H]
Enough crap!

99
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,691
You're not taking another step!

100
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,326
We've got you surrounded, now!

101
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,162
Yeah, he's right! There's no
way you can defeat all of us!

102
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,932
The Navy always wins.
Ya might as well give up!

My, what a fanciful strike!

109
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,254
Thanks, Iva, I owe ya!

[MARINES groaning, coughing]

111
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,697
[COBY]
Luffy.

[COBY panting]

114
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,604
You gonna fight?

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,209
[BOTH panting]

116
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,677
[MARINE L screams]

Coby!

118
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,655
I see it now.

119
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,192
I decided long ago that I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates.

120
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,628
If I have to die fighting
for that, then I die.

121
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,732
[COBY] If I put my mind to it,
if I'm prepared to die for it,

122
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,099
could I do something like that?

123
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:53,967
Like what?

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,669
Do you think...

125
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,239
Do you think I could
ever join the Marines?

126
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,005
Marines?

127
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,340
Yes!

128
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,243
Catching bad guys is the only
thing I've ever wanted to do!

129
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,912
It's been my dream
since I was a child!

130
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,083
If Luffy and I had
never met back then,

131
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,052
I couldn't have
made it this far.

132
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,221
[LUFFY panting]

133
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,990
All right, focus.

134
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,226
If I want any hope of
growing stronger as a Marine...

135
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,631
[COBY] ...I have to fight all
enemies, no matter who they are!

136
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,332
This is war!

137
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,838
I'm sorry, Luffy, but I'm
gonna have to kill you!

[LUFFY grunts]

141
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,433
Because I promised myself
that I'll keep trying...

00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,501
...till...

143
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,871
...till I become
a Marine admiral!

No.

I-I'm sorry, I got carried away!

147
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,280
This is so embarrassing.

148
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,582
I just wanna dig a hole
and bury my head in it!

149
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,950
That was really arrogant of me.

150
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:19,552
I got all worked up after
seeing you again and I just--

151
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,121
[LUFFY]
Coby.

152
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,256
You said you're gonna
fight me, right?

153
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,225
Then you will
become that strong.

154
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,594
You'll have to.

156
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,932
Yeah, but a Marine admiral?

157
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:35,670
Next time I see you,
we're gonna be stronger, too.

158
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,704
A whole lot stronger.

159
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,110
[COBY]
I don't get it.

160
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:52,286
[COBY] I just blurted out
some ridiculous dream,

161
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,255
something I don't even
have a right to follow...

162
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,191
[COBY]
...but he didn't laugh.

163
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,361
[COBY]
He believed in me.

164
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:06,032
[LUFFY]
...Bullet!

165
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,576
[COBY] Looks like I got
carried away again.

166
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:21,048
I'm useless after all. Guess
it's back to the drawing board.

00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,260
One of the Seven Warlords.

180
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,264
Navy ally detected.

181
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,598
Ceasing attack.

182
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,001
[LUFFY] Oh, yeah! You guys
are on the same side!

183
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,203
Thanks a bunch, Hancock!

184
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,139
[IVANKOV panting]
Isn't that the pirate empress?

185
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,742
Have you two got a thing
going on I should know about?

186
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,277
He said it.

187
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,713
He said my name and
he didn't get it wrong.

188
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,715
But of course! How could I?

189
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,584
[HANCOCK gasps]

190
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,587
Shower me in sweet
gratitude, my love!

191
00:12:33,621 --> 00:12:35,455
You have my thanks.

192
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,790
Yes.

193
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:38,392
Oh, and Hancock.

194
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,426
Yes.

195
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,061
I owe you my life.

196
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:41,829
[HANCOCK]
Yes!

197
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,863
Boa Hancock.

198
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,136
Please move. You are
standing in the way.

199
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,578
I never gave you permission
to address me in such a manner!

200
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,423
[WHITEBEARD groaning]

201
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,159
[WHITEBEARD]
Is that it, magma brat?

202
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,898
[MARCO]
Hold on... Pops.

203
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,767
I'm... coming to save you.

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,969
[MARCO groans]

205
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:26,007
Wow, it went straight through.

206
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,174
Take a few more of these

207
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,677
and have yourself a
nice, long rest, okay?

208
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,647
[MARCO grunts]
Yeah, just try and stop me!

209
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,117
Ah! Well that certainly
throws a wrinkle into my plan.

210
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,585
Regeneration, huh?

211
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:42,156
So that must be why they
call you the Phoenix.

212
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,459
Hey, give me a hand, will you?

213
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,826
[MARCO gasps]

Sea Prism Stone?

[PIRATES]
Commander Marco, no!

217
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:06,446
Ohh. It hurt that time, huh?

218
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,983
[PIRATE A]
They got Jozu, too!

219
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,218
He's frozen solid!

220
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,290
[PIRATE C]
That's two commanders down.

221
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,625
What should we do now?

222
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,294
Take out the head...

223
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,529
....and the body will follow!

224
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:28,001

226
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,122
He's in danger! [groans]

227
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,856
Hold still, you monster!

228
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,226
You fools! I will
not be chained!

229
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:55,195
Good, now close in fast!

230
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:58,232
Forget the others and attack
Whitebeard with all you've got!

231

We'll save him!

[PIRATES shout]

239
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,052

[WHITEBEARD]
You punks really think...

243
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,998
...that's all it
takes to defeat me?

244
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,098
[gasps]

245
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,271
[WHITEBEARD]
Just a few toy swords and guns?

[MARINES gasping]

247
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,043
[WHITEBEARD] I could tear
you all apart single-handedly.

248
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,479
But you know that, don't you?

249
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,681
Because you quake...

250
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:25,619
...when you hear
the name Whitebeard!

251
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,391

This is our chance!

264
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,128
Quickly, before he recovers!

00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:47,368
[MARINES groaning]

266
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,569

[panting]

269
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,776
What did he say?

270
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:02,316
Hmph. That's a good one.

271
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,952
I don't need to recover
from a scratch like this!

[ACE gasping]

273
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,693
[WHITEBEARD]
You think this will stop me?

274
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:15,228
That I'll lie down and give up?

275
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:25,539
[WHITEBEARD]
I'm not... such a fool.

276
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,577
[WHITEBEARD] I know what
will happen if I falter,

277
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,013
even for a moment.

278
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,749
What will happen if I die.

279
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,052
[PIRATES scream]

280
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:45,259
[WHITEBEARD]
And knowing that cold truth...

281
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:48,195
...I can't allow
myself to submit,

282
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:50,664
not until the bitter end.

283
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,571
So I'll wait until I've taken
care of the future for my sons.

284
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,976
[ACE gasping]

285
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:11,017
Got it, Ace?

286
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,790
Oh, Pops.

287
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,998

00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,576
Damn. And we were so close, too!

294
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,913
Bastards have formed a barrier
around Whitebeard's back!

295
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,616
You want us to bury
you with the old man?

296
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,853
[pants] Your mockery
does not sway my honor!

297
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:48,922
[JIMBEI grunts]

298
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,992
It is our pride and our
joy to stand beside him!

00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:56,930
You bunch of fools!

300
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,598
Get away!

[SQUARD]
Pops...

302
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,304
What are your orders, Captain?

303
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,873
Shouldn't we go help
defend Pops, too?

304
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,089
[PIRATE B] Captain Squard?
Where are you going?

305
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,224
[SQUARD]
Don't follow me.

306
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,626
You've done well,

307
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,561
but a cowardly traitor
such as myself

308
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,529
must face his punishment.

309
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,970
[SENGOKU]
Concerned about the future?

310
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,473
I'll be more than happy
to show it to you now.

311
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,841
Let's end this.

312
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,242
Execute it!

313
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,749
[PIRATES]
Ace! No!

00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,918
[LUFFY panting]

315
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,086
I'm too slow!

316
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,123
Don't make me laugh!

317
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:59,760
You think I can't stop
those runts from doing it?

this was the only way!

It's not over yet!

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,088
[IVANKOV] Did you just
do what I think you did?

333
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,858
It's the Conqueror's... Spirit!

[LUFFY panting]

335
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,729
Well damn, this is a mess.

336
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:47,267
There's a surprise for you.

337
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:59,846
Why, that little brat.

[LUFFY yelling]

339
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,297
[NARRATOR]
Unaware of his own power,

340
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,598
Luffy unleashes the
Conqueror's Spirit,

341
00:23:18,632 --> 00:23:21,202
temporarily halting
Ace's execution.

342
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,871
The Navy, now recognizing
the threat he poses,

343
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,006
sends all of their
forces after him.

344
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,277
Thankfully, Ivankov has a plan
that may forge a path to Ace.

345
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,112
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

346
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:36,049
"The Scaffold at Last!
The Way to Ace Has Opened!"

347
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,785
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
