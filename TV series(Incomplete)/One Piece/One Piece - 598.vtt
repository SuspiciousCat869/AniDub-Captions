00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.714
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.909
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:42.871
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:48.126
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.670
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:53.923
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.758
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.178
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.805
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:03.975
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.187
a boy whose body became rubber
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:07.228 --> 00:03:11.024
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:14.944
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.824
[NARRATOR] After a series
of fierce battles,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.659
the Straw Hat Pirates
have reached the waters

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.496
of the New World, ruled by
the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.207
Their first stop is Punk Hazard,

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.210
an island divided into
burning and frozen halves.

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.795
There, they learn of terrifying
experiments performed

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.173
by the master of the island,
Caesar Clown.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.508
Their struggles against the mad
scientist cause them to form

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.219
an alliance with Trafalgar Law,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.596
one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.097
After searching the island,

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.935
Luffy finally comes face-to-face
with Caesar, himself.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.984
[CAESAR CLOWN]
You shouldn't underestimate me.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:59.113
[LAW grunts]

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:02.242
[LAW]
Show yourself! Who are you?

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.662
[LAW groans]

00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:10.959
Why are... you here? Why now?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.213
[chuckles]

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:20.009
[VERGO]
How many years has it been?

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.680
Look at you, all grown up.

00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.056
Law.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.989
[LUFFY] "A Samurai Who Can
Cut Fire! Foxfire Kin'emon!"

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.035
[LAW grunts]

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.171
You think the boss doesn't
know what's going on?

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.257
I had hoped you were
smarter than that.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.844
[pants]

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:03.970
[VERGO]
To be honest with you,

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:06.431
we don't trust this
Caesar character either.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.560
The guy is shady.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.105
That's why the boss sent an
undercover agent to the island.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:16.107
The lovely Monet, here.

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:21.154
[VERGO] Rumor has it
you're a Warlord now.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.239
That's one hell of a promotion.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:30.580
When did you
get here... Vergo?

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:34.250
[VERGO]
Hm? Actually, I just arrived.

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.086
I was spending some
time in Dressrosa.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.839
I hitched a ride on an
SAD tanker leaving port.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.593
And now... It seems that
was the right move.

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:46.929
What do you mean by that?

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.766
Why target me? I didn't
do a damn thing to you!

00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:52.101
[VERGO]
No. Not yet, anyway.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.312
Because if you had,
you'd be dead right now.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.688
I hate to break it to ya,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.858
but there's no foolin'
us grown-ups, Law.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.318
[chuckles]

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.074
[LAW] Well. In that case,
I should just finish you!

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:09.952
Oh, yeah. One more
thing before I go.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:12.330
[LAW grunts]

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.499
[VERGO]
Show some respect, kid.

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:21.506
[LAW grunts]

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.224
It's Mr. Vergo to you.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.153
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.038
What the heck happened here?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.957
[MARINE D]
I got no idea!

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.500
Whaddya think we should do?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.378
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.380
He's got Tashigi!

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.340
No, that's Smoker, remember?

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.848
Y'know, I never thought
I'd see the Vice Admiral

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.350
get knocked out
twice in one day.

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:16.686
And he's not the only
one who went down!

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.646
Three of the
Straw Hats did, too!

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:20.982
Think the Master used
Conqueror's Haki?

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.358
[MARINE E]
Don't be ridiculous!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.652
There's no way he could be that
much stronger than them!

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.071
[MARINE F] Then what was it?
I mean, he beat all of them

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.365
without even layin'
a finger on 'em!

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:31.659
Well, that was fun
while it lasted.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.790
[CENTAUR A laughs]
That's what ya get, Navy!

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:40.251
You should've known better
than to mess with the Master!

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.378
He is our god of salvation.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.300
[CENTAURS] Master! Master!
Master! Master! Master!

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.260
Master! Master! Master!

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:54.223
[laughs] Now, we mustn't waste
any time, my strong soldiers!

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.393
Hurry and tie these five pirate
scoundrels up at once!

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.813
Use Sea Prism Stone Shackles
on the power holders.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.565
Once you're done,
I want you to move out!

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.526
Leave the sailors behind and
seek refuge inside the lab.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.945
It's far too dangerous out here.

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:14.368
I'm sure you've all noticed
the strange substance

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.245
that's been raining down
from the sky.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:19.415
There's no cause for concern,
I will ensure your safety.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.542
[CENTAURS]
Okay! Thank you, Master!

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.336
[CAESAR CLOWN] It seems
the Yeti Cool Brothers

00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:24.921
failed at their task.

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:29.383
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]
Oh well, I can't blame them.

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:31.844
I guess the combination
of Straw Hat and Law

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:33.888
was simply too much
for them to handle.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.557
[laughs]

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:52.865
[BROOK gasps]

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.502
[BROOK gasps]
Stay away!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.672
Whatcha waitin' for, Brook?
Tell 'em to back off.

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.549
Look, there's only so
much that I can do!

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.300
They're monsters,
for crying out loud!

00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.511
They're not gonna
negotiate with me!

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:19.517
[BROOK gasps]
They're melding together!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.018
Yeah, sorta.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.688
The blobs are getting bigger
by absorbing each other.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.692
[BROOK yells] This one's
almost as tall as me now!

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:38.202
[grunting]

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:42.915
I brought him with us,
so I can't let him die here.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:47.295
I may be a woman right now,
but it's time to man up!

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:48.504
I'm proud of you.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:51.966
Handle the ones behind you.
I won't be too long.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.720
[BROOK]
Careful! Good luck down there!

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.518
[grunting continues]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.981
Jeez. That cook's always
such a pain in the ass.

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:10.067
[BROOK gasps]

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.403
[BROOK yelps] No! Please!
Don't come after me!

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:14.530
I'm warning you.
Stay back, monster!

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.158
Whoa! How'd you suddenly
get to be so big?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.952
Hey, Zoro! Help me!

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.176
[BROOK exhales] Thank you!
I thought I was a goner!

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:36.385
[ZORO]
Huh?

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:39.388
Run! It's spitting gas!

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.183
[BROOK]
Huh? Ugh, right in the face!

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.602
[BROOK coughs]

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:48.648
No! It's poison gas!
My eyes! My eyes!

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:52.193
[gasps]
Oh wait, I don't have any eyes.

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:56.155
[BROOK] Guess what?
I'm immune to your attacks!

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.199
Now fight me,
gelatinous villain!

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.827
[BROOK shouting]
Oh, no! Not again!

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.330
Seems we can't use our
swords against them.

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:05.748
They spit poison gas!

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.875
Why'd you go and
poke the damn thing?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.460
You saw what it did to me!

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.879
I thought that maybe it
just didn't like you.

00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:13.589
[BROOK laughs]

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:16.050
[BROOK] Uh-oh,
they've got us surrounded.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:18.928
This is not good.

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.275
[SANJI (NAMI) shivers]
It's freezing!

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:36.362
I've gotta hurry and find
that samurai's torso!

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.615
Okay. Guess I'll have to use it.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.701
Observation Haki!

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.670
[BROOK]
What are we gonna do now?

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.130
We've got nowhere to run!

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:56.382
Hey, I know! They're made
of jelly, right?

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.217
I think you should
try eatin' one.

00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.885
What? No way!

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:03.055
I wish you'd stop bullying me
into things like this, Zoro!

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.558
I'm nearly 70 years
older than you!

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:08.352
Fine, sorry I asked.
Never mind, grandpa.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.438
I know you didn't
just call me that!

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:12.106
I'm no "grandpa",
I'm a lively skeleton--

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.067
[KIN'EMON yells]

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.444
[ZORO]
Whoa, what's wrong with him?

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:19.572
[BROOK]
You okay? Uh, Mr. Samurai?

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:22.241
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]
Damn, it's cold!

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.326
Sorry about this, Nami.

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:29.832
Huh? What's that? Is it the
slime's venom or something?

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.585
Well, that's just great.
Here's hopin' the torso's

00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:35.671
not stuck in the middle
of that poisonous cloud.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.427
[SANJI (NAMI)] I've been
using Observation Haki

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:44.180
for a while now and
I haven't found anything.

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.765
It must be gettin' weak.

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:48.017
I can't tell the difference
between its life force

00:12:48.058 --> 00:12:50.311
and the fish that're
swimmin' around!

00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:51.937
Hm? A shark?

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.155
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]
Are you kiddin' me?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:08.329
[yells]

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.542
[BROOK gasps] You feeling
alright, Mr. Samurai?

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.086
Hey, what's the matter?
You look like you're in pain.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:19.173
[yelling continues]

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:22.635
[SANJI (NAMI)] Oh no, ya don't!
You're not gettin' away from me!

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.771
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Stop chewin' on it, ya bastard!

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:37.608
[yells] This doesn't hurt,
it merely itches a bit!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.484
[yells]

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.694
Jeez, what's gotten
into this guy?

00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:43.948
It must be dreadful with
sounds like those.

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:47.034
[growls]
Ow! I'm fine!

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.245
Maybe something
happened to Sanji?

00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:50.579
[ZORO]
Hm.

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.915
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Let go of it or else, shark!

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:05.427
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Now! Joue Shoot!

00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:16.021
[SANJI (NAMI)] I've got the last
piece of the samurai puzzle!

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:19.483
Now we can put the poor
bastard back together again!

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:21.610
I gotta hurry and get to shore!

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.864
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Uh-oh, it's closin' up!

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.742
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Dammit!

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.916
[gasps]

00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:43.340
[SANJI (NAMI)]
The poison already got this far?

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:46.677
Now what'll I do?
I'm completely surrounded!

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:49.638
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Is Nami's body strong enough

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.931
to get me outta this?

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.058
Guess there's only
one way to find out.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.020
[BROOK gasps]
It's not looking good for Sanji!

00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:58.314
The whole lake is turning
the color of the poison!

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:00.149
He'd better hurry
and come ashore!

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.276
[BROOK shouts]

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.364
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Blue Walk!

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:11.118
Don't close up! Don't close up!
Don't close up! Don't close up!

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.581
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.333
Look! He made it out alive!

00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:20.628
Sure did. And he's
got the torso.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.841
[sobs]
Just like he said he would!

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:48.155
[whimper]
What can I say here?

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:51.533
I feared I would never have
my body back as it should be.

00:15:51.575 --> 00:15:55.037
But thanks to you, I'm a
whole samurai once again.

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:04.755
Wow! I must admit,

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.299
you're a lot taller than I
expected you to be.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:09.301
Even taller than me, I believe.

00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:13.347
Why yes, that's true.
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.767
Gentlemen. I am
the samurai, Kin'emon.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.687
I hail from a town called
Kuri in the Land of Wano,

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:20.980
if you're not aware.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.192
Can somebody help me out here?
I'm about to freeze to death!

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:29.321
Yes! Sorry to keep you waiting!
This should do it!

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:34.326
[SANJI (NAMI) grunts]
It's still cold.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:37.454
That coat's going to disappear
once he takes it off, right?

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.665
What shall I call you,
Curly Eyebrow?

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.626
I would like to know your
honorable name, my good sir.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:45.879
[grunts]
Fine. My name is Sanji!

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.881
Cut the "sir" crap, okay?

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:49.717
What, you get your body back
and all of a sudden

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:51.385
you start actin'
like Mr. Manners?

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.220
I put my neck out to help
you when you were just

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.723
a severed head, but instead
of bein' appreciative,

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:59.810
you kept hurlin' insults at me!
Do you remember what you said?

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.311
[KIN'EMON gasps]

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:05.399
[KIN'EMON]
If only I had known sooner!

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.483
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:09.903
I loathe pirates!
Though I should have guessed.

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.573
That does explain
your barbarism!

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:15.868
Ah! You're on my last nerve!

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:19.872
All you have to say is,
"help me find my body!"

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:22.332
Asking for help
from you pirates?

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.376
I would rather die!

00:17:24.418 --> 00:17:27.379
Yes, but I'm sure you must
pity a poor disembodied head

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.715
who can't even defend himself
if someone attacks.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:32.551
So, would you like
to carry me? Huh?

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:37.598
[whimpers]

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.397
I'm a horrible person.
Please forgive me!

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:49.651
I owe you my life!
I'll never forget your kindness.

00:17:49.693 --> 00:17:51.570
Not as long as I live!

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:54.615
I insulted you and your friends,
yet you rescued me.

00:17:54.656 --> 00:17:57.367
I doubted you when you swore
to make me whole again.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.412
And I wasn't convinced
until it happened!

00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:03.207
Forgive me!
I'm begging you!

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.752
I don't deserve your kindness!
I never should've doubted you!

00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.963
What the hell're you doing?
Lift your head, you idiot!

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:13.300
No man should ever get down on
his knees and beg, you got that?

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:18.597
Yeah. I was just thinking.
Without you... I would be--

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:19.598
[KIN'EMON sobs]

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.058
Sorry.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.353
As much as I hate to interrupt
this touching moment, I must.

00:18:24.394 --> 00:18:25.395
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.189
You see, it would appear that

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.191
we're in mortal
danger right now.

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:33.862
[BROOK] Thanks to our...
colorful friend.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:06.311
[CHOPPER grunts]

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.946
[CHOPPER] It's his laboratory.
This is my chance!

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.366
I need to figure out how
he made the NHC10.

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:25.164
[CHOPPER gasps]
Is that?

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.759
Perfect! It should be in
this book somewhere!

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.887
Now, to find sedatives.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:01.366
[laughs]

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:04.203
[CENTAUR A] Master, the airship
is prepped and ready to go.

00:20:04.244 --> 00:20:06.413
I see. Excellent work.

00:20:06.455 --> 00:20:09.499
Why don't we stop by
and pick up the children?

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:12.085
It's about time for them
to have another candy.

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:15.255
Put the Straw Hats and
the Marines in a cage.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.966
And then carry it to
my chambers at once.

00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.344
[CENTAURS]
Yes, Master!

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.763
[grunts]

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:27.976
[BROOK gasps] We're trapped!
There's nowhere for us to go!

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.356
What's with all
the slime, guys?

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:35.442
I thought I told you
to do somethin' about it!

00:20:35.484 --> 00:20:38.737
Well, we tried and it
didn't work, so we just gave up.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.656
What were we s'posed to do?

00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:43.033
You chumps shouldn't've
given up so easily!

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.868
We've gotta stop it somehow!

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.328
We all know that
Nami would kill me

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.830
if anything were to
happen to this body.

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:53.335
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:56.046
You are never gonna give
it back to her, are you?

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.215
Nope, no way in hell.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.591
If I may make a suggestion,

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.468
why don't we try to
destroy it with fire?

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.970
[ALL]
Huh?

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.098
See my blade?
It burns as it cuts!

00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:09.268
That's why I am known
as Foxfire Kin'emon.

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:12.771
Allow me to blaze a path
so that we may escape!

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:16.775
You can burn and slice enemies?

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:19.361
Sounds a lot like magic,
if you ask me.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.871
[KIN'EMON]
Hm.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:35.711
[KIN'EMON shouts]

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.677
[gasps]

00:21:43.719 --> 00:21:45.345
[growls]

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.987
[gasps]

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:10.287
He cut through it! No way!

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.331
[KIN'EMON] I've cleared
our path of the slime.

00:22:12.372 --> 00:22:14.207
I'm coming for you, Momonosuke!

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:17.002
[BROOK shouts]
How are we still alive?

00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:19.171
I thought we were engulfed
by the fire from that massive

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:21.423
explosion, but I
suppose not, huh?

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.425
Excuse me, Mr. Kin'emon?

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.720
If you wouldn't mind, could you
explain what just happened?

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.057
I don't mind at all.
I cut through the explosion.

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.141
And how'd you do that?

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.685
[KIN'EMON] My Foxfire
Style slices with flame.

00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:36.605
And through the knowledge and
use of my myriad of secret arts,

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:39.441
I am able to cut
through flame as well.

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:43.820
There is no fire that can
withstand my blade. None!

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:46.907
Now then,
Momonosuke is in danger.

00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:50.118
I must go and rescue him.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.703
I'll take my leave.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.504
[ZORO]
Hang on!

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.505
[KIN'EMON]
Hm?

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:04.132
I've always wanted to
see a samurai in action.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:08.804
Tell you what, Kin'emon.
I'll help you save your son.

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.097
[chuckles]

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.940
[NARRATOR] A mysterious
individual appears

00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:23.819
and manages to injure Law
with his overwhelming strength.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.946
While the horrifying
truth of this individual

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:27.489
leaves the straw Hats shocked,

00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:30.242
it's nothing compared to when
they discover the true identity

00:23:30.283 --> 00:23:34.454
of the mastermind behind
Ceasar and the enigmatic Vergo.

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:35.997
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:39.960
"Shocking! The True Identity
of the Mystery Man Vergo!"

00:23:40.001 --> 00:23:42.754
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
