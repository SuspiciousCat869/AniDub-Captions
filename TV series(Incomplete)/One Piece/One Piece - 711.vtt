00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:46.199
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.571
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:51.810
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.714
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.058
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:02.999
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:04.536
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.342
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.718
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.658 --> 00:03:17.027
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.664
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.568
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.601 --> 00:03:24.341
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:27.616
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:31.322
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:33.727
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.132
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:38.203
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:41.342
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:47.923
[DOFLAMINGO]
Fine, Bellamy. I've had my fun.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.393
You're free from me now.

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:53.000
Just like you've
always been, right?

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.869
[gasps]

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:59.145
[LUFFY] I'll give Mingo an extra
kick in the ass for you, okay?

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:04.355
Hold on! You remember
this technique?

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:06.259
It's been a while.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:08.931
Okay. You ready?

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:11.636
Spring Hopper!

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.841
Let's go!

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:15.043
[gasps]

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.224
[SAI] Drill Dragon Nail!
Now say goodbye!

00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:25.899
[LAO G screams]

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:30.106
[yells]

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.881
[LAO G]
Young Master, forgive me!

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:38.322
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:48.010
[LAO G]
G!

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:50.514
You accursed gorilla!

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:54.188
Gorilla with a capital G!

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.830
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.374
Call me the Don!

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.798
[LUFFY] "The Man's Pride!
Bellamy's Last Charge!"

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:32.798
Uh-oh. This is not good.
Lao G is out for the count!

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:40.748
[ZORO]
That's some real power.

00:05:43.386 --> 00:05:45.558
[ZORO] I think I've heard of
these guys before.

00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:48.931
The Happosui Army from Kano.

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:49.933
I'll be careful.

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.574
Anyone can become
an enemy at any time.

00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:56.212
Hey, Gramps! C'mon, wake up!

00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:58.116
Don't die! Not now!

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.792
I'll reserve two event venues
for us real soon. 'Kay, sweetie?

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:04.495
Venues? For what?

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.202
One for our wedding, of course.
And then the funeral.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.174
--He's not dead!
--I'm not dead!

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:12.878
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.999
[PICA laughs]

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.470
That laugh makes you
sound stupid as hell!

00:06:25.504 --> 00:06:26.640
Stop, already!

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:30.882
[PICA]
What? I'm enjoying myself!

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:35.423
Stop trying to take
my fun away! Charlestone!

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.577
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:59.605
Your aim sure sucks.

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:02.812
[ZORO grunts]

00:07:06.352 --> 00:07:08.757
[ZORO]
Tch. He got away!

00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:12.497
[ZORO]
You're just a one-trick pony!

00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:20.614
Gotta figure something out.

00:07:22.183 --> 00:07:26.092
[ELIZABELLO] Need some
assistance, Pirate Hunter?

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:28.396
The punching guy.

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:31.468
The name is Elizabello.

00:07:31.503 --> 00:07:34.141
King Riku's an old friend.

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:37.181
I hope to restore him to power.

00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:38.584
I'm charged and ready.

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:41.322
I can unleash my
King Punch once per hour.

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:44.963
Have you figured out how that
stone giant's ability works?

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:46.866
Yeah. A long time ago.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.606
Then tell me and
I'll finish him off.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:53.914
Sorry, pal, but I want
to beat him, myself.

00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:57.253
Hold onto that
trump card of yours.

00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:59.926
We still don't know
what's to come.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:06.238
Then I'll take your advice
and leave this to you.

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:22.071
You big, stupid rock.

00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:25.176
Whatever you're plotting,
it won't work.

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:33.894
[PICA laughs]

00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.110
[chuckles]

00:08:42.143 --> 00:08:46.486
[DIAMANTE] Well, don't just
stand there! Stop me already!

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.458
Is all that fluttering
wearing you down?

00:08:49.492 --> 00:08:55.337
If you can't take it, why don't
you try groveling, Toy Soldier!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.673
[gasps]

00:08:56.706 --> 00:09:01.415
[DIAMANTE laughs]
I thought so! That confirms it!

00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:02.818
All those years ago.

00:09:02.852 --> 00:09:06.458
That toy soldier crying
like a baby in the rain.

00:09:06.492 --> 00:09:09.231
That was the mighty Kyros!

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:26.933
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:33.145
[gasps, sobs]

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:36.753
[KYROS]
Scarlet!

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:44.201
[DIAMANTE] You're Scarlet's
husband and Rebecca's father.

00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:47.006
It's all connected!

00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:53.253
[DIAMANTE] Perfect!
Why, I imagine you've got

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:57.528
quite a lot of bad blood
to settle with me, don't you?

00:09:57.562 --> 00:10:01.401
That's correct! Why do you
think I came here?

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:05.945
Whoa, not bad!

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:07.915
It seems you found your footing!

00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:10.487
But my cape's made
of steel! Watch out!

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.756
[gasps]

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:16.666
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:20.173
Vipera Glaive!

00:10:20.206 --> 00:10:22.143
[gasps] Rebecca!

00:10:25.584 --> 00:10:27.387
[KYROS grunts]

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.230
Ahh.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.138
[REBECCA]
Father!

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:40.279
[chuckles]

00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:43.319
Time to die!

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.027
Look out.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.362
[REBECCA gasps]

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:53.874
[KYROS panting]

00:10:53.907 --> 00:11:00.053
[chuckles] You gonna take your
revenge or not, toy soldier?

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:03.026
[REBECCA] He keeps distracting
Father by targeting me.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.631
Let me fight!
I won't get in your way!

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.699
[panting]

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.135
Good call!

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:12.344
Wouldn't want to miss your
own funeral! Right, Rebecca?

00:11:12.377 --> 00:11:13.479
[gasps]

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:15.116
[KYROS grunts]

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.594
I had such a lovely time
killing your wife.

00:11:20.628 --> 00:11:23.465
I have to kill
your daughter, too!

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:27.007
[panting]

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.476
Let me help!

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.746
I'll fight alone!

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.650
I want to protect you!

00:11:31.683 --> 00:11:35.489
This is my atonement! [pants]

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:38.029
For your mother,
and for forcing you

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.500
to fight alone all those years.

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:43.774
[KYROS] I'm so ashamed for
putting you through that--

00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:46.279
for failing to protect you!

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.051
Now that my human
form has returned,

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.523
I want my daughter
to live in peace

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:54.227
and never swing a sword again!

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:06.720
[TOWNSGIRL A crying]

00:12:06.754 --> 00:12:08.122
[TOWNSWOMAN A gasps]

00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:24.254
You're all right now.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.897
[SABO]
Here, drink this.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.368
Thank you very much, sir!

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.312
[GLADIATOR A] Hey! Somebody!
We got an emergency over here!

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:40.487
My friends are stuck in the jail
cells down in the coliseum!

00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:41.956
[SABO]
Take me there.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.062
You're talking about the
prisoner gladiators, right?

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:47.467
[GLADIATOR A]
Uh, yeah. This way!

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:55.016
[SABO]
Luffy.

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:08.242
You got stronger since last
time, but I got stronger, too!

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:11.082
You wanna see destructive power?

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:13.920
I've taken this to the max!

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.125
You're finally free!

00:13:16.158 --> 00:13:18.296
Now cut it out, before you die!

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:22.236
Pathetic! Stop showing
mercy to your enemy!

00:13:23.172 --> 00:13:24.709
[BELLAMY]
I know I'm pitiful!

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:26.913
I know I looked up to
the wrong man!

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:29.885
I don't need to
hear it from you!

00:13:35.163 --> 00:13:39.337
I don't care about
the past. Let Bellamy go!

00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:40.574
Heh.

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:47.788
[DOFLAMINGO] Nah. That's for
the victor to decide.

00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:52.798
This pitiful worm
crawled here just to die.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.302
Isn't that right, Bellamy?

00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:58.209
[BELLAMY]
But I made my choice!

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.848
I can't turn on him just because
I didn't get what I wanted!

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.250
If I don't see this
through to the end,

00:14:02.283 --> 00:14:04.154
then I'll be worse
than a failure.

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:07.160
I'll be a complete disgrace!

00:14:08.228 --> 00:14:10.767
I have to hold on to something!

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:14.374
Even a loser like me
has some dignity!

00:14:14.407 --> 00:14:17.013
This will be my
final battle, Straw Hat!

00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:20.252
See it through
to the end with me!

00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:47.040
Stop it, Bellamy!

00:14:47.073 --> 00:14:49.812
[BELLAMY] Shut up!
I've heard enough from you!

00:14:49.846 --> 00:14:53.686
Let me settle this
on my own terms, damn it!

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:03.005
This fight is dumb!
We shouldn't have to do this!

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.681
[BELLAMY] You don't wanna
accept this fight, huh?

00:15:07.715 --> 00:15:09.117
Thing is,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.192
the time when pirates dreamt
about the future is over!

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:15.998
Things like the great One Piece?

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.636
The fools who dream of
these fictional treasures

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.408
don't notice the real treasures
that surround them!

00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.415
They end up chasing these
ridiculous puppy dog dreams

00:15:24.448 --> 00:15:26.418
and die in the process!

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:27.588
[cackles]

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.928
There's nothing but
a bunch of dead idiots!

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.967
So when I see people
chasing dreams of One Piece,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.539
I get disgusted!

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:42.785
Luffy!

00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:45.624
[CUSTOMERS cheering]

00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:47.929
[CUSTOMER 146M] Get outta here,
you scrawny punk.

00:15:47.962 --> 00:15:50.634
[CUSTOMER 146N]
Put him in a body bag!

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:53.940
[NAMI] Luffy! Zoro!
Forget that pacifist crap

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:57.446
I was talking about
and take this jerk out!

00:15:58.416 --> 00:15:59.084
Zoro.

00:15:59.117 --> 00:16:00.420
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:04.662
No matter what happens,
don't fight back.

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.503
[BELLAMY] Just like last time
I picked a fight with you.

00:16:08.536 --> 00:16:10.139
But who cares?

00:16:10.173 --> 00:16:13.212
You can just stand there
if you don't accept it!

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:15.450
But I'm fighting you either way!

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:16.519
[gasps]

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:21.194
I'll show you what I'm made of!

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:27.641
My conviction is nothing
to scoff at, damn it!

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.811
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:49.183
[TREBOL laughs]

00:16:55.831 --> 00:16:57.099
[gasps]

00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:04.147
[LAW groans]

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.202
[DOFLAMINGO]
This is pathetic, Law.

00:17:15.236 --> 00:17:18.075
Your attempt at revenge
just isn't going to happen.

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:22.216
[TREBOL] Pathetic! You said it,
Doffy! He's pathetic!

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.321
You always were
stubborn, though.

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:27.694
Should I chop off your other arm
to drive home my point?

00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:30.533
[groaning]

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:32.070
[DOFLAMINGO]
You don't want to die?

00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:34.308
Then I'll kill you
nice and slow.

00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:37.413
You'll be begging
by the time I'm done.

00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:42.992
[LAW groans]

00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:44.562
[DOFLAMINGO]
Trebol!

00:17:44.595 --> 00:17:49.404
[TREBOL laughs]
I get to have fun, too!

00:17:50.139 --> 00:17:52.511
[TREBOL laughs]

00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:03.867
I was willing to
give up an arm or two

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.438
if it meant I could win.

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:11.549
He's lost it!
That dummy! What a joke!

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.758
Pentachromatic Strings!

00:18:15.791 --> 00:18:17.259
[LAW groans]

00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:21.636
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:18:25.577 --> 00:18:26.713
[LAW]
Room!

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:29.150
Counter Shock!

00:18:30.987 --> 00:18:32.858
[TREBOL]
You okay, Doffy?

00:18:32.891 --> 00:18:37.601
[groans, pants]

00:18:37.634 --> 00:18:42.545
[panting] Still got some
fight in you, I see.

00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:44.213
Little punk!

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:48.022
Have some Fallbright!

00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:49.658
[LAW gasps]

00:18:59.343 --> 00:19:04.287
Don't worry, you'll be with
Corazon soon enough, Law.

00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:06.391
[LUFFY groans]

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.171
Stop it, Bellamy!

00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:21.355
[panting]

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:22.924
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.964
[DOFLAMINGO] Were you counting
on Straw Hat to save you?

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.702
He's still not here!

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:29.037
Wonder what happened?

00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:32.744
[yelling]

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:36.484
[pants]

00:19:37.722 --> 00:19:39.490
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:43.666
[TREBOL laughs]
Still haven't lost your cool?

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.275
You realize you're
about to die, right? Huh?

00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:53.251
[panting]

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:59.431
[LUFFY]
I said cut it out!

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:01.401
[BELLAMY] When Doflamingo
told me I was free,

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.472
do you understand
what he meant?!

00:20:03.507 --> 00:20:05.778
I failed him! I was fired!

00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:08.951
It means the Family
has thrown me away!

00:20:08.984 --> 00:20:10.319
But that's a good thing,

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:12.891
since Mingo was just
using you in the first place!

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.998
[BELLAMY] So I turn on him and
side with you all of a sudden?

00:20:16.031 --> 00:20:19.137
I told you! Even I've
got principles!

00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:22.377
I may be an idiot,
but I won't be a traitor!

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.317
And I won't be
a sore loser, either!

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.561
[yells]

00:20:30.594 --> 00:20:33.265
Bellamy!

00:20:33.298 --> 00:20:36.371
Sticky Launcher!

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.509
[groans]

00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:50.233
[coughs]

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:53.472
[TREBOL laughs]
You just won't die, huh?

00:20:53.507 --> 00:20:56.278
Hey, hey. Hey, Law, c'mon!

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:59.117
I think it's time to
call it quits, little buddy!

00:20:59.151 --> 00:21:02.290
[panting]

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:05.062
Take it easy, Law. Rest.

00:21:05.096 --> 00:21:10.405
[panting]

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.420
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B groans]

00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:19.758
[CAVENDISH] Stand up, Gladius.
You don't want to die,

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:23.399
crawling on the ground
like a beast, do you?

00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:27.039
I smell the sweet
aroma of victory.

00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:29.344
Now fight! Don't make me wait!

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:32.717
[GLADIUS]
Hmph. This should shut you up.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:40.934
Oh no.

00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.838
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:45.643
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Gladius! Wait! You can't!

00:21:54.494 --> 00:21:57.634
He's turned the
whole area into a bomb!

00:21:58.537 --> 00:22:00.473
[GLADIUS]
You know what happens next?

00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:03.212
You've been plotting this
for ages now, haven't you?

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:07.053
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasping]

00:22:07.087 --> 00:22:09.056
Run for your lives!

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.094
Get away!

00:22:12.697 --> 00:22:13.867
[CAVENDISH]
Hey, Bartolomeo!

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.737
Everything in the area
is about to blow!

00:22:15.771 --> 00:22:17.508
Let me inside
your barrier, quick!

00:22:17.541 --> 00:22:18.577
[BARTOLOMEO]
Not a chance.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.812
Why not?

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:22.283
If I open it, that'll put
me and Miss Robin in danger.

00:22:22.316 --> 00:22:24.220
Also, enemies might sneak in.

00:22:24.253 --> 00:22:25.489
But I'm your ally!

00:22:25.523 --> 00:22:27.293
You can't just leave me to die!

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:30.198
Gladius, sir! You're gonna
blow us up, too!

00:22:30.232 --> 00:22:34.307
[GLADIUS] You'll be fine.
You're professionals, after all.

00:22:34.341 --> 00:22:36.745
Lemme in! Lemme in!

00:22:37.447 --> 00:22:39.551
[yelling]

00:22:41.454 --> 00:22:44.828
[GLADIUS]
Pop Rock Fest!

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:51.875
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES scream]

00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:07.707
[GLADIUS]
Farewell, Cavendish.

00:23:14.822 --> 00:23:17.359
[NARRATOR] The battle against
Gladius rages back and forth,

00:23:17.393 --> 00:23:19.698
with no end in sight,
until Dellinger joins in

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.635
and threatens to turn the tide.

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:24.407
When things begin to look dire
for Robin and her allies,

00:23:24.441 --> 00:23:26.679
the sleeping weapon,
Hakuba awakens,

00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:29.651
and a duel of extreme speed
breaks out on the plateau.

00:23:29.685 --> 00:23:31.421
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:35.897
"A Strong Wind and a Surge!
Hakuba vs. Dellinger!"

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.036
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
