00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,605
Wapol's gonna drown.

182
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,673
He can't swim!

183
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,308
[CHESS]
Recall the troops!

184
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,676
There's no time to waste!

185
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,412
We have to rescue him
before he sinks to the bottom!

186
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,113
Go, go, go!

187
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,315
This is far from over...!

188
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,149
You'll pay...!

189
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,684
I promise you'll pay!

190
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,652
Your dead! You brat!

191
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,288
[CHESS] You'd better
hope Wapol doesn't die!

192
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,324
[KUROMARIMO]
Or it's your blood we'll spill!

193
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,491
Remember that!

194
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,527
We'll get you for this!

195
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,204
Wow... Crazy...

196
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,206
Those guys are really upset...

197
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,675
What were they callin' that
ole garbage can, "Wapol"?

198
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,644
[SANJI] Who cares about
what his name was.

199
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,545
Don't worry about it...

200
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,680
The guy's obviously a moron.

201
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,482
Best to just forget about him.

202
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:23,222
[WAPOL laughs]

203
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,191
I know him...

204
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,693
But from where?

205
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,588
[SUBORDINATE]
Captain Smoker!

206
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,190
I've just intercepted
a very intriguing signal!

207
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,393
[SMOKER]
What is it?

208
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,062
Ah!

209
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,531
Such an incredible, full temper!

210
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,400
The legendary... Kashu!

211
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,269
[SMOKER]
Tashigi! Tashigi!

212
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,404
Only here in the Grand Line

213
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,408
could I find such a prized
sword as this so quickly!

214
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,375
Tashigi!

215
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,777
Come here!

216
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,611
Are you deaf...?

217
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,278
Ah!

218
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,247
Yes, sir! Coming, Captain...

219
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,683
Ah!

220
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,919
[TASHIGI shrieks]

221
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,422
[SMOKER] Stop clowning
around and get over here!

222
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,424
I need you to listen to this!

223
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,426
Oh, neat...

224
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,262
A Black Transponder
Snail listening device!

225
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,363
Listen close...

226
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,732
We just picked up this
conversation minutes ago...

227
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,900
I've got it all queued up...

228
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,134
Ready, Sergeant major?

229
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,269
Uh... Yes...

230
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,537
Play it back please...

231
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,441
[MR. 0] It's Mr. 0 now quit
fooling around, you jack ass...

232
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,444
Have you eliminated Princess
Vivi and the Straw Hats...

233
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,779
Straw hats? Straw Hat Pirates!

234
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,447
[SANJI]
Oh, yeah...

235
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,582
The mission was successful...

236
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,450
[MR. 0]
From this point on,

237
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,785
all my orders will
be sent via letter

238
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,887
following the usual protocal...

239
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,889
That will be all Mr. 3...

240
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,625
And the rest of the message
is undecipherable static.

241
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,461
It's a faint signal...

242
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,795
But there are key
names and phrases

243
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,299
laced in their conversation
that clearly stood out.

244
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,467
Princess Vivi...

245
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,801
Straw Hats...

246
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,503
Orders via letter...

247
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,472
And Mr. 0.

248
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,641
Mr. 0? Could that be
a codename for somebody?!

249
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,677
In fact, it's quite possible
he could be connected

250
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,813
to that suspicious swordsman
we caught earlier in Runess.

251
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,750
What'd he say his
name was? Mr. 11?

252
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,984
[SMOKER]
Possibly...

253
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:36,422
Part of a criminal organization
that uses numbers for codenames

254
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,491
and sends orders via letter...

255
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,792
Sound about right?

256
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,962
Ha! Mr. 0...? Organization...?

257
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,431
I have no idea what
you're going on about.

258
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,800
Then how do you explain
the letter of detailed orders

259
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,502
we found in your pocket?

260
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,203
[MR. 11]
Uh! Damn letter!

261
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,338
I thought I burned it!

262
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,441
Wait... That's not... not mine!

263
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,976
That's funny...

264
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,312
Because we didn't actually
find anything in your pocket.

265
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,515
Ah!

266
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,650
[SMOKER]
Hmm...

267
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,220
All right, then...

268
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,455
Princess Vivi...

269
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,991
If I remember correctly,
she's from Alabasta

270
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,959
and reports say
she's currently missing...

271
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,828
Excuse me for interrupting,

272
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,631
but isn't the Alabasta Kingdom
in the middle of a coup...?

273
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,567
I wonder if this mysterious
criminal organization and the

274
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,670
Straw Hat Pirates could somehow
be involved in the uprising?

275
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,905
Who knows...

276
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,707
All I know for certain is that
this is the only clue we have

277
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,243
to the Straw Hat's whereabouts.

278
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,011
This means...

279
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,479
We're going...?

280
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,313
[SMOKER]
Yes...

281
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,015
I want you to
contact Headquarters

282
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,017
and get an Eternal Pose!

283
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,219
[SUBORDINATE]
Yes, sir!

284
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,988
It's time we pay
a little visit...

285
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:47,359
...to Alabasta,
the kingdom of sand.

286
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,743
[pants]

287
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,615
Maybe...

288
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,451
Are you sure she
isn't just hungry...?

289
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,854
If that's really the reason
that Nami's like this...

290
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,423
Then maybe we should try
feeding her lots of meat...

291
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,424
Shut up...

292
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,291
Come on, Nami!

293
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,292
Cheer up!

294
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,528
Look, check this out!
You're gonna love it!

295
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,366
No change... at all.

296
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,471
I know...
Douse her in water...

297
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,572
That'll fix her.

298
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,774
You idiot!

299
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,876
This isn't good.

300
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,777
The sun's about to set
and she's still the same.

301
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,446
Yeah... right...

302
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,748
Maybe it would be best if
we drop anchor somewhere...

303
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,450
We can't navigate
at night anyway

304
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,552
without the help of
Nami's instructions.

305
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,887
That's true.

306
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,000
Ah! You want my autograph
because I'm so famous?!

307
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,479
Sure is a cold one...

308
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,686
Almost a full moon...

309
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:11,904
[hammering]

310
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,914
Crap, I fell asleep!

311
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,683
You're up early!

312
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,852
Can't just sit
around doing nothing...!

313
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:30,389
We gotta find a way out of
this jam as quick as possible!

314
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,692
You're right...

315
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,160
That's a good point.

316
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,399
[LUFFY]
C'mon, Nami!

317
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,934
Would ya look?!

318
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,735
This is weird.

319
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,870
Why won't you wake
up and smile?!

320
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,205
C'mon, just one tiny smile...

321
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,039
What's goin' on, Luffy?

322
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,073
[LUFFY]
Huh?

323
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,077
[gasps]

324
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,079
Quit it... You're
freakin me out!

325
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,856
Say, Usopp...?

326
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:07,593
Does this area seem
unusually calm and cold?

327
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,129
[USOPP] Yeah, now that
you mention it, it sure does...

328
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,564
To be honest,
it's freaking me out.

329
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,067
The Grand Line just
keeps getting stranger.

330
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,036
That's not necessarily true.

331
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,903
[USOPP]
Huh?

332
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,570
Maybe...

333
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,472
There's an island nearby...

334
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,573
Hey, Sanji...!

335
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,642
Will you check the horizon
for any sign of land?

336
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,744
Sure thing.

337
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,547
There's a winter island
somewhere nearby... I think.

338
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,948
[SANJI]
Winter island?

339
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,750
Scattered within
the Grand Line...

340
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,485
There are four basic
types of islands,

341
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,888
made distinct by
their varying climates.

342
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,757
You've got summer
islands, spring islands,

343
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,927
autumn islands,
and of course, winter islands...

344
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,930
Each one has its own four
independent seasons.

345
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,098
When traveling
on the Grand Line,

346
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,767
there are at least 16 different
types of weather patterns

347
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,803
you must be prepared to endure.

348
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,738
Ranging from summer
island summer all the way

349
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,941
to winter island winter,
and everything in between.

350
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,776
There can always
be exceptions to this,

351
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,578
and you could even
encounter unknown climates

352
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,013
at any given moment.

353
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,581
[USOPP]
I think I get it...

354
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,117
The Grand Line has all
these different islands,

355
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,920
one after the other, and
that's the reason why the seas

356
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,290
between them have such crazy,
unstable weather patterns.

357
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,124
[VIVI]
Correct.

358
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,759
And the closer
you get to an island,

359
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,794
the calmer the
sea is around you.

360
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,163
Which is why I asked Sanji
to start looking for land.

361
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,132
That's it...

362
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,133
I see it!

363
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:21,800
[gasps]

364
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,301
Huh?

365
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,136
Quack?

366
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,706
[SANJI]
Island dead ahead!

367
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,975
Are you serious?!

368
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:30,976
Oh! An island...!

369
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,211
We found an island!

370
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,212
Hey, Nami! Did you hear that?!

371
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,681
This means we can
get you to a real doctor!

372
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,816
He'll fix you up!
Wake up! Wake up!

373
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:45,157
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

374
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,826
Just go look.
I've got her covered.

375
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:55,567
Ahhhh! There it is!
Nami's saved!

376
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,401
All white...?!

377
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,037
It's snow...!
A snow... island...

378
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,006
Whoa... Luffy, wait...

379
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,675
Just so there's no
misunderstanding between us,

380
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,677
we're stopping to
find Nami a doctor!

381
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,180
We're not here to
have an adventure!

382
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,149
Are we clear...

383
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,186
I love snow... It's so white!

384
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,889
It's no use. He's gone.

385
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,589
H‐H‐Hold on!

386
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,024
You sure this is a good idea?!

387
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,692
There could be snow monsters!

388
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,595
Besides, we don't even know
if there's people there or not!

389
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,863
Oh, no! I'm having a relapse

390
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,865
of my don't‐go‐
to‐the‐island disease!

391
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:27,900
Ah, snow...!

392
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,702
It's so white and beautiful!

393
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,205
Guess I'll get ready
for the inevitable.

394
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,803
I'm so happy!
Look at the... snow!

395
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,971
Look at the mountains.

396
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,907
They're unlike
anything I've ever seen.

397
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,942
[USOPP]
Say, Luffy.

398
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,044
Aren't you cold,
dressed like that?

399
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,379
[VIVI] It's ten degrees
below freezing out here!

400
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,216
That's when bears
get ready to hibernate!

401
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,585
Huh? Oh, boy...

402
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,487
Cold!

403
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,790
You just figured that out?!

404
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,930
It's a stream of melted snow.

405
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,933
This may provide a
good spot to disembark.

406
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,268
'Kay, guys...

407
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,270
Doctor search‐‐who wants in?

408
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,938
Guess we gotta
find people here first.

409
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,073
I'm in!

410
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:41,940
Me too!

411
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,976
Fine...! Go have fun!

412
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,944
[DALTON]
That's far enough, pirates!

413
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,746
[gasps]

414
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,961
People! Well, that was easy.

415
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,363
Yeah, nice...

416
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,798
But, they don't
seem too friendly.

417
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,275
I'll only say this once.

418
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,844
Your kind is not welcome here.

419
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,212
Leave immediately!

420
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,147
We only came here
to find a doctor!

421
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,982
We have someone who's sick!

422
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,317
You'll have to do
better than that!

423
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,352
We won't fall
for that old trick!

424
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,320
[VILLAGER B]
This is our island!

425
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,890
We won't let any
filthy pirates land here!

426
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,859
[VILLAGER C]
Raise anchor and leave now!

427
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,495
Or we'll blow you and
your ship out of the water!

428
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,562
That's great...

429
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,366
We barely said hello,
and they already hate us...

430
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,235
[VILLAGER A]
Get outta here!

431
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,036
Look out!

432
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,370
That was a big mistake!
