00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,557
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,261
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,828
in search of the One Piece,

00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,865

King of the Pirates.

00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,203
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,871
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,807
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,677
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,312
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,846
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,850
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,486
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,890
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:17,764
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,637
[NARRATOR] Luffy escaped the
War of the Best with his life,

18
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,206
but failed to save his
brother from execution.

19
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,542
In the days after,
only thoughts of his crew

20
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,044
could save him from despair.

21
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,713
It was then that
Dark King Rayleigh

22
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,616
made an unexpected suggestion.

23
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,285
Let me offer you
some friendly advice.

[RAYLEIGH]
Hmm.

29
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,769
It's all right.

30
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:03,009
Luffy.

31
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,481
[JIMBEI]
This is all so unexpected.

32
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,217
Please, Rayleigh,
it's far too soon for this.

33
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,251
Luffy?

34
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,188
[RAYLEIGH]
Just my opinion, of course,

35
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,658
but I do think it's
what you and your crew need.

36
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,493
Luffy's body and mind alike

37
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,795
have suffered from
this terrible ordeal.

38
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,798
Although there is
truth in your words,

39
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,900
if he cannot heal,
then all is meaningless.

40
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,871
But my crew won't know.

41
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,072
That's true,

42
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,809
they'll likely return to
Sabaody as you agreed before.

43
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:39,813
The events at Marineford were
publicized all over the world.

44
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,782
Though you're still reported
as "missing," I'm sure.

45
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,518

Then I have to go see them.

A promise is a promise, right?

49
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,393
So, I need to go to Sabaody.

50
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,674
Well, then I may have
another suggestion for you.

51
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,909

she hijacked a balloon

177
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,574
The boy's a real upstart.

178
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:17,244
Caused quite the ruckus
in Marineford, they say.

179
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,813
He's famous for that
straw hat that he wears.

180
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,749
[HAREDAS]
Look at that grin.

181
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,951
He's a charming little
rogue, isn't he?

182
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,023
[NAMI] Our crew has been
separated for a while now,

183
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,893
so he doesn't even know
if we're alive or dead.

184
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:36,529
I had no idea what he was going
through until I read that paper.

185
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,201
I've been taking it
easy all this time

186
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,803
while he was down there
fighting for his life.

187
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,810
[HAREDAS]
Hmm?

188
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,013
He saw his brother killed
right before his eyes.

189
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,715
I didn't even know.

190
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,017
I couldn't do anything.

191
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,721
And now he's waiting for me.

192
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,557
And for the rest of
the crew, I'm sure.

193
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,693
[OLD MEN gasping]

194
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,762
Luffy is strong, but this
is too much to bear.

195
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:16,069
I want to be there for him.
I want to help him.

196
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,305
[NAMI crying]

197
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,206
[OLD MEN screaming]

198
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,844
Hey, hey! Don't cry.
You'll be okay!

199
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:25,412
[OLD MAN H]
Hurry up and let her out!

200
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,847
[OLD MAN E] We're the
real villains! Look at us!

201
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,850
Abducting an innocent young
girl and making her cry!

202
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,119
[OLD MAN J]
Give Haredas the key!

203
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,654
[OLD MAN K]
Quickly now!

204
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,322
[HAREDAS]
We're sorry, young lady.

205
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,556
Let's sort this out and--

206
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,961
--[OLD MEN gasp]
--[HAREDAS screams]

207
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,999
[OLD MAN I]
That's odd. Where did she go?

208
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,301
[OLD MAN E]
I don't see Haredas, either.

209
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,735
[OLD MEN gasp]

210
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,243
[OLD MEN]
Huh? How did she move so fast?

211
00:12:57,411 --> 00:12:59,212
Thanks for everything!

212
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,181
Bye, bye!

213
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,449
[OLD MEN]
Huh? "Bye, bye"?

214
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,686
She pretended to cry
to take Haredas hostage?

215
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,288
And she's stealing
our stuff again, too!

216
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,591
We can't let that
little harpy escape!

217
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,593
Away we go!

218
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,394
[OLD MAN H]
The world below isn't ready

219
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,396
for the genius of our research!

220
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,198
[OLD MAN E]
I know! I know!

221
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,869
Take me to the sea! Anywhere!
I can't do it by myself!

222
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,070
Impossible!

223
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,838
[NAMI]
Make it possible!

224
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,176
[NAMI] Luffy, hang on,
just a little bit longer.

225
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,578
I'm sorry. Every time
we've been in trouble,

226
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,380
you've been there to help us.

227
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:36,683
Just this once, I hope
we can return the favor.

228
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,619
[OLD MEN]
Help! Thief! Get back here!

229
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,857
You've already captured
me, young lady.

230
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,327
You don't need to pretend
to cry like that anymore.

231
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,427
[NAMI gasps]

232
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,162
[NAMI]
Shut up!

233
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,531
[HAREDAS screams]

234
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,486
[NARRATOR] We now return
to Future Land Baldimore,

235
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,357
a mechanical island where the
genius, Dr. Vegapunk, was born.

236
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,165
[KITTON]
Grandpa! It's an emergency!

237
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,700
The freak! The freak! The freak!

238
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,170
I mean, the Frank! I mean
the Franky, Mr. Frank.

239
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,037
I mean, I mean, Franky!

240
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,341
Just calm down
and tell me, Kitton.

241
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,576
Franky!

242
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,213
He's acting all different again,
but this time it's scary!

243
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,114
He's like some kinda monster!

244
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,150
Someone get me a ship!

245
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,854
[KITTON yelps]
He's coming for me!

246
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,155
Tell the truth, Kitton.

247
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,657
You put something strange
in that poor man's stomach

248
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,459
to see what would
happen, didn't you?

249
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:55,696
Like habanero juice or
kimchi soda or some nonsense?

250
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,731
Nuh-uh, not this time!

251
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,532
--[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER] Hm?
--[KITTON screams]

252
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:04,105
[KITTON whimpering]

253
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:08,708
[FRANKY panting]
It's an emergency, Gramps.

254
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,310
I gotta go see my friends.

255
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,046
I know this's sudden, but I
won't take no for an answer.

256
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,250
I need a ship, dammit,
and I need it right now!

257
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,284
A ship?

258
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,721
Sorry to say, but that
won't be possible.

259
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:21,822
Huh?

260
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,023
We don't have a ship.

261
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,426
There's not a single one
on the entire island.

262
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,427
There's a liner that
comes to our country

263
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,929
each month to bring us supplies,

264
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:32,032
but we don't have any
sea-faring vessels of our own.

265
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,936
All right, fine, when's
the liner due back, then?

266
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,006
Not for a while yet, I'm afraid.
It stopped by last week.

267
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,173
That's no good.

268
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,010
I can't wait. There's gotta
be some way around this.

269
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,344
[FRANKY grunts]

270
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:48,015
You may have noticed this island
is surrounded by walls of ice.

271
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,617
For better or worse,
it works like a fortress.

272
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,920
The only ships that
can reach us are

273
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:57,658
specially-equipped icebreakers
and certain Navy vessels.

274
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,227
[groans] Well, this is bullcrap!

275
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,996
[FRANKY] I could get
supplies to build a ship,

276
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,730
but that still
wouldn't be fast enough.

277
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,867
[FRANKY growls]

278
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,168
Please calm down.

279
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,070
Do you want some
tea or something?

280
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,305
[FRANKY gasps]

281
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:22,415
[FRANKY]
Mm. This aroma is just lovely!

282
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,620
[ALL yelling]

283
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,123
[FRANKY]
I ain't got time for this!

284
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,025
I'm tellin' ya,
I gotta blow this joint

285
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,293
and I gotta do it fast!

286
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,728
[BOTH whimpering]

287
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:39,466
[FRANKY panting]

288
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,005
My captain needs me right now!

289
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,410
I'm lower than dirt
if I let him down.

290
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,810
Damn it all.

291
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,215
I didn't know.

292
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,951
I understand how
important this is to you.

293
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,986
But there's nothing
you can do but wait.

294
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,922
[FRANKY grunting]

295
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,996
Oh! Here's an idea!

296
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,130
Yeah?

297
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,366
If I recall, Dr. Vegapunk
developed an icebreaker.

298
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,804
It should still be tucked away
in his laboratory, I'd think.

299
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:19,239
Of course, it's been years since
anyone's touched the thing.

300
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,107
[FRANKY chuckles]

301
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,409
Who can say if it
still works. Oh!

302
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,813
I know it's dangerous,
so I'll stay home this time.

303
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:26,847
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER gasps]

304
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,349
Then I know just where to go.

305
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,650
Hold on. You've gone there?

306
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,252
Both of you
without a word to me?

307
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,420
[FRANKY, KITTON]
Yeah.

308
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:34,488
--[FRANKY] And it was awesome.
--[KITTON] Sure did.

309
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,689
What?!

310
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,326
If it's broken,
then I can fix it.

311
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,395
I am a shipwright after all!

312
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,263
That's not exactly
the concern here.

313
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,466
I'm takin' this
party to the lab!

314
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,267
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Wait! Listen to me!

315
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:52,772
[FRANKY]
It's cold!

316
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:03,050
[siren blaring]

317
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,951
[MARINE C]
We have an intruder!

318
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,588
[MARINE D] Someone's broken
into Dr. Vegapunk's lab!

319
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,755
What should we do?

320
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:12,359
Dammit! Apprehend them,
but don't use any firearms!

321
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,894
His inventions are too valuable.

322
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,830
We can't afford to have
even one damaged. Understand?

323
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,465
[MARINE D]
Yes, sir!

324
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,733
[FRANKY panting]

325
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,435
Get back here!

326
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,103
Crap! They musta
tightened security

327
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,671
after the last time I broke in!

328
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:27,508
I can't get anything done
with these guys chasing me!

329
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,575
[grunts]

330
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:33,046
Hold on. I get it now.

331
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:35,582
We can't shoot in here.

332
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:40,153
[MARINE D]
Don't let him get away! Go!

333
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,725
[FRANKY] Wait, what d'you mean
the lab is full of treasure?

334
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:45,826
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Vegapunk is the head

335
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,260
of the Navy's science division,

336
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:51,165
so all of his works are
valuable. Priceless, really.

337
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,200
Our country's very proud of him.

338
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,471
Although, I suppose it's his
mind that's the real treasure.

339
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,908
At any rate, he spent his
youth working in that lab,

340
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,309
tirelessly.

341
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,313
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Have you noticed that mountain?

342
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,448
A rather unnatural
shape, isn't it?

343
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,917
I never gave it much
thought, but yeah.

344
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,519
There's a story behind it?

345
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,121
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
It's a project Vegapunk

346
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:17,524
began as a child. It was meant
to protect the island's people

347
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,460
from frigid weather.

348
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,729
He built it by
transforming the animals

349
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,531
in the forest into
a robotic work force.

350
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,368
Unfortunately,
it remains unfinished.

351
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:30,938
It's a sort of geothermal system
to heat up the whole island.

352
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,439
[grunts]

353
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,144
The world just can't keep
up with his imagination.

354
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,712
That's why so many of his works

355
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:41,882
remain buried here in
a state of half-completion.

356
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:46,220
Sometimes, the technology or
funds he needed didn't exist.

357
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,656
Even though he couldn't
get rid of the cold,

358
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,391
knowing that he cared,

359
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:55,195
knowing that he worked so hard,
warmed our hearts at least.

360
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:58,398
[whimpers]

361
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,434
That story is super depressing!

362
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,869
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Ya think so?

363
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,338
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
But the people here are happy

364
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,308
to wait for his return.
Whenever that may be.

365
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,946
Please respect our feelings
and stay out of that lab.

366
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,816
After all, it's equipped
with a self-destruct button,

367
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,118
in case you wanted to know.

368
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:19,320
But why? Not the button.

369
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,288
I mean, why did you think
I would want to know that?

370
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,490
Like I was gonna press
the dumb thing?

371
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:26,727
Either way, that
sounds pretty scary.

372
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,329
Why don't we forget about
this whole mess and go home?

373
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,665
I'll make you some
nice, hot tea, okay?

374
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,367
Sorry, kiddo, no way.

375
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,701
I didn't come all
the way out here

376
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,903
with no pants on
just to turn around.

377
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:40,074
I'm gettin' that icebreaker
if it's the last thing I do.

378
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:44,077
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate your hospitality,

379
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,612
but I read the paper today

380
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:49,650
and it turns out that my captain
has gone through hell and back.

381
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,051
So, bye!

382
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,253
You guys have a nice life!

383
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:54,521
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
I know it's tempting,

384
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,591
but no matter what, don't press
that self-destruct button!

385
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,493
Would you give it
a rest already?

386
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,529
Why the hell would I want
to do something like that?

387
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,064
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER grunts]

388
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,103
[panting]

389
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:14,141
[MARINE E] Hey! I saw someone
down this hallway! Over there!

390
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,609
Hurry!

391
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:19,780
I can't find the ship
with them chasing me!

392
00:21:19,814 --> 00:21:20,981
[MARINE E]
Halt!

393
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,883
Did you hear?

394
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,986
The Marines came by and said
someone broke into the lab.

395
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,489
That's not good. Let's just
hope they catch him.

396
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,957
They're probably looking to
sell stuff on the black market.

397
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,061
Even a blueprint from that
place would be worth a fortune.

398
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:35,595
[MARINE F]
This way?

399
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:41,401
Well, that was a pain
in the butt. Huh?

400
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,037
[MARINE A] I shouldn't
need to you remind you,

401
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,973
but so much as sneeze on one of
Dr. Vegapunk's masterpieces,

402
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:47,941
and you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison!

403
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,543
I don't care if you're a Marine!

404
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,777
[MARINES]
Sir!

405
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,385
I can't believe the
doctor cooked up

406
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,120
all this stuff when
he was so young.

407
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:03,390
'Cause this is super brilliant
work if I've ever seen it.

408
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:04,724
Half of this is so advanced,

409
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:08,061
it'll take another hundred years
before the world is ready.

410
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,797
Maybe I don't wanna
mess with this.

411
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,066
As a fellow engineer,
I gotta respect the man's work.

412
00:22:17,037 --> 00:22:18,672
Huh?

413
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:21,675
Sweet! He's got
a pirate mark, too?

414
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,625
[BOTH screaming]

415
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:40,861
[CROWD screaming]

416
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:41,928
[ALL gasping]

417
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,764
[FRANKY]
So, hypothetically...

418
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:46,800
...if by some crazy chance
I press that button,

419
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,634
like you said...

420
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,536
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Hm?

421
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:50,637
Yeah, go on.

422
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,039
[FRANKY] You wouldn't, like,
hold it against me, would you?

423
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:55,009
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER, KITTON]
Of course, we would!

424
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,413
[NARRATOR] News of this incident
quickly spread across the world

425
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:04,451
and history would remember it
as "Baldimore's Nightmare."

426
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,830
[NARRATOR] Zoro makes
a wild dash to the sea

427
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:18,065
as Mihawk watches on.

428
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:20,934
Will the master swordsman
impart wisdom to Zoro,

429
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:24,004
or will their reunion end
in another deadly duel?

430
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:27,841
Meanwhile, Luffy begins
a daring plan of his own.

431
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,677
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

432
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,513
"Encounter! The Great
Swordsman Mihawk!

433
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:35,249
Zoro's Self-Willed
Deadly Struggle!"

434
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
