1
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,222
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,959
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,527
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,530
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,065
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,868
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,536
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,472
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,342
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,977
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,512
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,948
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,185
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:08,488
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,758
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,429
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,635
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,804
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,906
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,675
Thanks to a final charge
from Whitebeard's associates,

21
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,578
success seemed to be
within Luffy's grasp.

22
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,982
But then, the unthinkable
happened and Admiral Akainu

23
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,518
landed a fatal blow
against Luffy's brother.

24
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,656
[WHITEBEARD] The man that
Gol D. Roger was waiting for--

25
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,059
it's not you, Teach.

26
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,260
Not a damn chance.

27
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,428
Hah?

28
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,102
[WHITEBEARD]
Forgive me, my sons.

29
00:03:56,136 --> 00:04:01,809
I raised a fool and
I couldn't take responsibility,

30
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,011
but you boys gave me everything

31
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,980
I could have ever
wanted out of life.

32
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,384
[WHITEBEARD]
I am deeply grateful.

33
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,023
[WHITEBEARD]
Goodbye, my sons.

34
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,535
[REPORTER A] You guys in
the head office watching this?

35
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,138
This Marineford business
is gonna change the world!

36
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,606
So, it's true after all.

37
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,175
Not only Ace,
but Whitebeard, too?

38
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,679
Unreal. They killed him?

39
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,380
[NARRATOR]
The news spread like wildfire,

40
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,350
falling on ears that could
scarcely believe the words.

41
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,552
Ace, son of the
great Gold Roger,

42
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,855
fell in battle
alongside Whitebeard,

43
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,123
who was powerless to save him.

44
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,327
Extra! Get ready
to issue an extra!

45
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,862
[REPORTER E] We just
received some breaking news!

46
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,099
Whitebeard was killed
shortly after Fire Fist Ace,

47
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,669
and the Marines
have claimed victory.

48
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,170
He's really dead.

49
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,872
Yeah!

50
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,508
His crew is done for!
There's peace again!

51
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,777
If the Navy can take
care of Whitebeard...

52
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,113
...then the rest of the
pirates will follow!

53
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,781
[NARRATOR]
While many celebrated,

54
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,085
those who saw these events
unfold with their own eyes,

55
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,989
stand transfixed,
their mouths agape,

56
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,891
words frozen on their lips.

57
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,301
Bon voyage, Whitebeard.

58
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,781
[panting]

59
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:50,150
[NARRATOR]
His name was Edward Newgate.

60
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:54,288
In his prime, he stood against
even the King of the Pirates.

61
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,089
His crew was his family

62
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,360
and he fought beside them
into the ripe old age of 72.

63
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,963
The world knew him
as "Whitebeard."

64
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,533
[NARRATOR] He had stepped
boldly into Marineford and

65
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,402
brought the walls of the Navy
Headquarters down around him,

66
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,240
and yet, despite his superhuman
efforts, the Navy forces,

67
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:17,177
aided by the Seven Warlords,
proved too strong.

68
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:21,148
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]

69
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,783
Ah, what a day!

70
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,553
It's the birth of a new world
or the death of an old one,

71
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,555
and look! Heh.

72
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,858
I think today's party may
have some life in it yet!

73
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,595
We've certainly got some
villainous figures here

74
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,564
to keep things
interesting, I'm sure.

75
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,800
You wouldn't guess
by looking at him,

76
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,337
but that Blackbeard
is quite a thinker.

77
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,738
[REPORTER F]
I don't like this.

78
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,507
Why do I get the feeling things
just took a turn for the worse?

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,912
Also, what Whitebeard said
before he died troubles me.

80
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,314
The One Piece!

81
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,583
[SENGOKU gasps]

82
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,286
The One Piece is real!

83
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,656
Now it's only a matter of time

84
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,824
before word spreads to
the rest of the world.

85
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,928
He's riling up all the pirates,
just like Roger did.

86
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,229
Speaking of pirates,

87
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,066
how do you think Blackbeard
fits into this whole equation?

88
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,203
Surely, he didn't show up just
to kill his old captain, right?

89
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:24,077

For what it's worth,
we all share your sentiment,

94
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,261
but it's not the
time for revenge.

hurry up, you fools!

your captain's

Forgive me, old man.

Forgive me, Ace.

Despite my efforts, I was
powerless to save either of you.

At the very least, I vow that
no more harm will come to Luffy.

Ah-ha! He's teaching us
a lesson about sympathy!

Seeing Whitebeard's suffering
filled him with pity,

158

and humanity triumphed
over savagery! Beautiful!

engraved upon my soul!

Our inner spirits have been
corrupted, longing for violence,

when we should have
been thinking of mercy!

He had a shot at
fame and fortune,

but he understood that the
cost of his personal integrity

was a price too high to pay!

167
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,175
Because material gains
are ultimately meaningless

168

in these trying times!

That old codger
was tough as nails!

175
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,100
I thought he'd never die!

176
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,304
A minor delay, yes,
but scarcely unexpected.

177
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,405
Now for the fun part.

178
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,740
[laughs]

179
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:50,443
Yeah, let's give 'em a magic
show they'll never forget!

180
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,917
[MARINES gasp]

181
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,752
Be careful! Who knows
what they're planning!

182
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,120
You monster!

183
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,988
Haven't you done enough to Pops?

184
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,192
[cackling]

185
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,195
Watch carefully,
it's a good trick!

186
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,396
So good in fact,

187
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,265
it's gonna shake the whole
world down to its core!

188
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,268
[MARINE AA]
Whatever this is, it's not good.

189
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,370
[MARINE BB]
Is he doing something to

190
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,072
Whitebeard's corpse in there?

191
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,373
Ah, ha.

192
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,143
Now, now. I know you're curious,
but please don't interrupt!

193
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,145
Don't get too cocky, pirates!

194
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,714
He joined the Seven Warlords
just so he could betray us.

195
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,716
Whatever he's up to,
you can bet it won't be good!

196
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,952
[DEVON chuckles]

197
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,487
I can't wait.

198
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,990
So, what happens if
this plan doesn't work?

199
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:36,857
We disband?

200
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,692
[BURGESS laughing]

201
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,094
[LAFITTE chuckles]

202
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,565
[PIRATE AA]
Keep moving! We're almost there!

203
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,769
[JIMBEI]
Luffy!

204
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:50,303
I know it hurts right now,

205
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,040
but you must carry on,
for in a world without Ace,

206
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,675
your courage will be needed...

207
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,778
Tomorrow and every day after.

208
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,112
[MARINE CC]
Fire!

209
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:01,949
[JIMBEI]
It's a heavy weight,

210
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,384
but one I'm confident
you can bear.

211
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,553
[ACE]
Jimbei...

212
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:09,523
I know I might not make
it out of this alive.

213
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,324
[JIMBEI grunts]

214
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,526
I'm sorry,

215
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,829
but if I die, would you
look after my brother for me?

216
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:21,535
I fear you misjudge
my character, Ace.

217
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,303
I mean no disrespect,

218
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,306
but I may not be
as charitable as you think.

219
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,341
I'm certain you care
for your brother,

220
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,644
but we live in
a world of pirates.

221
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,547
I offer my aid to those
I hold in high regard,

222
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:36,216
but... only to them.

223
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,621
[JIMBEI] Although your
death was a tragedy,

224
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,789
it did not sway my feelings,

225
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,292
and yet it would appear
I've found the answer

226
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,627
to your request all the same.

227
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,270
[JIMBEI] Rest easy.
Your brother is worthy

228
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,340
of whatever favor my
humble strength can grant.

229
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,242
[JIMBEI groaning]

230
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,382
[HANCOCK] I wish I could
heal Luffy myself,

231
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,051
but I will have
to entrust him to you.

232
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,120
[MARINE F]
Pacifistas! Aim for Straw Hat!

233
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:14,455
Jimbei betrayed us.

234
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,457
He's just like
any other pirate now.

235
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,225
So, kill him if need be!

236
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,696
[HANCOCK]
Perfume Femur!

237
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,036
That's enough, Hancock!

238
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,972
One more of those and
we open fire on you, too!

239
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:37,378
The execution was a success,
and Whitebeard is dead, too!

240
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,180
I consider pushy men
to be an extreme turn-off!

241
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,482
[MARINE F gasping]

242
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,153
[HANCOCK] I've done
all that I can, Jimbei.

243
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,388
Take good care of my darling.

244
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,390
We've got room on
this ship over here!

245
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,458
[JIMBEI]
Coming!

246
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,860
What the...?

247
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,201
Damn it, and we were
so close, too!

248
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,535
You mean we're stuck?

249
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,604
[PIRATE BB] Well, we've
gotta do something!

250
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,140
[PIRATE CC] Aokiji's coming!
Somebody stop him!

251
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,612
We have to run. Go!

252
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:25,492
Did you really think you
could get away from me?

253
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:29,263
Why don't you save yourself some
trouble and let me kill you?

254
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:33,533
[JIMBEI growls]

255
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:59,526
Hand over Dragon's son and
I may decide to spare you.

256
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,696
Akainu. I thought
Pops killed him!

257
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,698
But how did he survive the fall?

258
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,099
Did he come out of the ground?

259
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,135
Those lava powers freak me out!

260
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,970
Jimbei!

261
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,673
A generous offer,
but I must refuse.

262
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,909
You aren't the only
tenacious one here.

263
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:18,245
I've decided to protect
this boy, no matter the cost.

264
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,180
Have it your way, then.

265
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,949
I won't ask twice.

266
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,018
[JIMBEI growls]

267
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:27,888
Aw, jeez. Admiral Akainu
won't be satisfied till

268
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,824
Straw Hat's six feet under,
and you know him,

269
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:34,561
once he's got his eyes set
on someone, there's no escape.

270
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,296
C'mon, Luffy...

271
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,831
[PIRATE H, PIRATE G grunting]

272
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,233
[AKAINU]
Hmm?

273
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,869
You're not gonna lay
a finger on Straw Hat!

274
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,937
Pops wanted us to protect him.

275
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,139
That's right,

276
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,376
and if he's Ace's brother,
then he's our family, too!

277
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,244
This family crap again?

278
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,912
Listen to yourselves.

279
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,914
You act brave now,

280
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,549
but if I recall, you were happy

281
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,152
to leave your beloved "brother"
and "father" to their fates

282
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,854
and run away to save yourselves.

283
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:00,588
What?

284
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,155
Go to hell!

285
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,130
Huh? Do we have a plan B?

286
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,067
Useless cowards! Out of my way!

287
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,301
[IVANKOV]
Make room!

288
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:14,968
[IVANKOV grunts]

289
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:15,869
Coming through!

290
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,572
Emporio Face Growth Synthesis!

291
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:20,874
[INAZUMA]
If I may...

292
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,443
I believe I can be
of assistance here.

293
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,981
[INAZUMA]
Great Scissors!

294
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,084
Keep those magma-covered paws

295
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,619
of yours off of Straw Boy!

296
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,422
This kid is history
and his father will be next!

297
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:39,693
Hell Wink!

298
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,036
[IVANKOV] He's been pushing
himself since Impel Down.

299
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,172
He's past his limit
physically and emotionally.

300
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,375
It's a wonder he's still alive.

301
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,178
One more hiccup,
and we could lose him.

302
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,346
If something were
to happen on my watch,

303
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,682
I could never show my
giant face to his father again.

304
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:06,320
As Dragon's comrade, it's
my duty to protect his family.

305
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,988
I feel the same.

306
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,958
I have a job to do here,

307
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:13,727
so I'd appreciate it
if you would step aside,

308
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,862
unless you're
lookin' to die, too!

309
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,898
My goodness, you're sassy!

310
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,299
You think you're hot stuff?

311
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,668
You ain't seen
nothing yet, Magma Boy!

312
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,504
Because this queen is on fire!

313
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:38,618
[MARINES gasping]

314
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,556
I do believe it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

315
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,191
C'mon, Captain, hurry
up and show us already!

316
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,794
[chuckles]

317
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,902
[LAFITTE]
Ladies and gentlemen,

318
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,572
mostly gentlemen, we are
grateful for your patience.

319
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,341
Captain Teach and his merry men

320
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,977
present to you
a stunning spectacle,

321
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,112
the likes of which
you've never seen.

322
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,647
One, two...

323
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,481
Ta-dah!

324
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:15,188
Uh... What did he do?

325
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,861
He was doing something
in there, but what?

326
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,396
[MARINE DD] Whitebeard's
body looks the same.

327
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,268
[MARINE DD]
Blackbeard's, too, I think?

328
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,735
[BLACKBEARD chuckles]

329
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,472
It's been fun, huh?

330
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,376
The Warlord thing, I mean.
You played your part well...

331
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,714
...but as you'll see,
I don't need you anymore.

332
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,215
[MARINES grunt]

333
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,219
[cackling]

334
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,454
[BLACKBEARD]
Black Hole!

335
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,257
Uh-oh.

336
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,859
[MARINES yelping]

337
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:54,494
[MARINE I]
What's' happening?

338
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,733
This one here, you all know.

339
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:02,502
It's my Dark Dark Fruit
power, but this...

340
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:05,406
[gasps]

341
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,274
[BLACKBEARD]
Just watch!

342
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:09,876
[MARINES gasping]

343
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,345
[MARCO gasps]
No, it can't be.

344
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,517
[MARINES scream]

345
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,717
[BLACKBEARD yells]

346
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:25,325
[MARINES yell]

347
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,962
[laughing]

348
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:33,733
[MARCO, KARMA gasp]

349
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,740
An earthquake?

350
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,175
That's the power of
the Tremor Tremor Fruit!

351
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,679
I thought if you had two Devil
Fruit powers, you would die

352
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,248
and how did he take them from
Whitebeard in the first place?

353
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,851
[cackles]

354
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,153
[VASCO, BURGESS laughing]

355
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:55,156
I can't believe
you pulled it off!

356
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,891
Seems I chose the
right side after all.

357
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,194
Though seeing as I was
getting tortured every day,

358
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,995
I didn't have
anywhere to go but up.

359
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,863
[chuckles]

360
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:04,932
[DEVON laughs]

361
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,501
[PIRATE DD]
He stole that power from Pops!

362
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:10,537
I know, but how?
That isn't normal, is it?

363
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,505
[LAFITTE chuckles]

364
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,174
[cackles]

365
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:16,509
A hand of darkness
to call forth the void,

366
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:20,147
a hand of light to shake the
heavens and rend the earth.

367
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,315
Both are mine,

368
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:25,519
and the world will tremble
with my every step.

369
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,789
Only a fool would dare defy me!

370
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,692
[BLACKBEARD PIRATES laughing]

371
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,295
I don't know how he
did it, but he did it.

372
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:36,864
You can't fake having
a power like that!

373
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,565
What does he know that we don't?

374
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,867
[MARINE M]
Damn!

375
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,137
We beat Whitebeard, but so what?
It's even worse than before!

376
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,439
But hold on...

377
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,274
I thought if you tried to get
a second Devil Fruit power,

378
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,643
then your body
would like, blow up!

379
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:50,610
[MARCO]
Yeah,

380
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,879
for normal people
that's how it works.

381
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,481
But you know as
well as I do that

382
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,583
Teach is anything but normal,

383
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,185
and with that body of his,

384
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,854
he can pull a trick
we couldn't even dream of.

385
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,658
He's probably been planning
this thing for ages now.

386
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,360
[BLACKBEARD]
Got got your attention now!

387
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:08,662
[BLACKBEARD cackles]

388
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:10,197
[BLACKBEARD]
This is a wakeup call to all

389
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:13,334
the boring peace-lovers,
the half-assed pirates,

390
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,236
the fat-headed fools
in World Government,

391
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,405
the ignorant masses!

392
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,941
This is a nightmare.
It just has to be.

393
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:24,211
We all must answer
to the hand of fate!

394
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,814
[laughing]

395
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,116
And fate has chosen me

396
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,451
to conquer this world!

397
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:36,023
This isn't fair! The Navy won.

398
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,425
Roger's son is dead
and so is Whitebeard!

399
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,493
We're all doomed.

400
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,429
Even the Admirals can't
fight someone like that.

401
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:45,399
He's a monster... A demon.

402
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,333
Damn it!

403
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,369
I thought this war
was over already!

404
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:49,770
How many people have to die

405
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:52,672
before we can stop
these pirates for good?

406
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,509
[COBY] I told myself this
execution was a necessary evil,

407
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,446
but after all this, we're even
worse off than when we started!

408
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,152
[cackling]

409
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,096
[NARRATOR] Having stolen
Whitebeard's Devil Fruit power,

410
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,632
Blackbeard rampages
to his heart's content.

411
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,434
Meanwhile, Akainu and the Navy

412
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,170
massacre the pirates
in the name of justice.

413
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,439
As the battlefield
becomes a living nightmare,

414
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:29,209
Coby stares on in horror,
voices echoing in his head.

415
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,078
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

416
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:34,548
"The Insatiable Akainu!
Lava Fists

417
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:37,851
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
