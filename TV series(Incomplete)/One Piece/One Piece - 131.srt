[CHOPPER yelling]

180
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,720
Back then I received
a good scolding from Doctorine

181
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,622
that I'll never forget.

182
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,064
I wonder how Doctorine is
getting along these days.

183
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,133
I think I'll write her a letter.

184

[CHOPPER sniffs]

185
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,936
Huh?

186
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,072
So, they're called
Rumble Balls, right?

187
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,840
[screams]

188
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,778
[CHOPPER]
You're trying to uncover

189
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,813
the secret of the
Rumble Ball, aren't you?

190
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,182
And once you get it,
you're going to assassinate me!

191
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,750
But that's not gonna happen!

192
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,320
I won't be taken down
by a snake like you!

193
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,921
[CHOPPER screams]

194
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,256
Rumble!

195
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,825
[CHOPPER]
Guard Point!

196
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,598

201
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,045
See the power of
the Rumble Ball!

202
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,981
You are no match
for the Rumble Ball!

203
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,783
It can give me the ability
to find your weak point!

204
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,718
Brain Point.

205
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,019
Wide Scope!

206
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,955
[CHOPPER]
Weak point, weak point!

207
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,724
Where's her weak point?

208
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,293
[ROBIN laughs]

209
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,894
Hey, what do you find so funny?

210
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,329
Look, there's no need
to be afraid.

211
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm not going to hurt you.

212
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,068
Hey! Stop it!

213
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,970
Stop it! Stop tickling me!

214
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,973
[laughing]

215
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,809
Aren't you just
the cutest furball.

216
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,878
I do like you.

217
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,984
Cu‐Cutest?

218
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,152
[yelps] Give me a break!

219
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,420
I'm not falling
for your flattery!

220
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,922
Think by making me happy it'll
throw me off guard or something?

221
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,824
C'mon, do I look happy to you?

222
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,725
Can't fool me!

223
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,327
I gotcha! I'm in!
I'm wise to your game...

224
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,362
[ROBIN]
Well then, shall we go?

225
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,399
Don't we need to refill
the water you just wasted?

226
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,000
[CHOPPER]
Uh...

227
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,069
[ROBIN]
I like to drink a cup of coffee

228
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,370
on deck while reading.

00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,339
[ROBIN]
What's the matter?

231
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,241
It's only fair that
you go draw the water

232
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,777
since you're the one who
spilt it in the first place.

233
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,211
[CHOPPER]
Yes.

234
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,197
[USOPP]
Jeez.

235
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,232
How could I even
contemplate working

236
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,069
on such a beautiful
day like this?

237
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,738
[yawns]

238
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,815
Whoa! Lots of monkeys!

He got me!

245
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,101
My life flashed before my eyes.

246
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,902
I thought that was it...

247
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,404
...the end of Captain Usopp!

248
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,972
No more adventures!

249
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,507
I didn't get a good look
at what attacked me,

250
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,943
but it must've been
a huge condor!

251
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,744
Why me?

252
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,245
Because I had to
fight for my life,

253
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,247
I couldn't gather
a single piece of fruit!

254
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,415
Oh, well.

255
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,249
That's okay.

256
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,486
No need for anyone
to worry about me.

257
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,954
I'm dead.

258
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,923
[ZORO] I wish somebody would
give me a good explanation

259
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,925
why I have to take orders
from that woman!

260
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,796
Seriously, she's gonna
drive me insane!

Where's the contour line?

265
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,362
That's it!

266
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,033
[NAMI] The right ridgeline
is right around 42 degrees.

267
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,501
What a coincidence!

268
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,136
If you measured my love for you

269
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,573
it would be exactly
42 degrees Celsius!

270
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474

[CHOPPER] I'm the one who's
gotta fetch the water.

What?! [screams]

277
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,334
You scared me to death!
What's wrong?!

278
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,268
Nothing.

279
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,839
Just commenting...
on the beautiful day.

280
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,174
I've been longing to
take a walk like this.

281
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,078
I haven't felt such peace
for quite some time.

282
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:11,116
[ROBIN hums]

283
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,422
In the past, it seemed like
I was always wound too tight

284
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,257
from repressing my emotions.

285
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,192
I never got the chance to smile.

286
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,460
Huh?

287
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,468
Fresh water!

288
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,494
So, um, if I remember
the story correctly,

289
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,264
didn't you say you've been alone
since you were eight or so?

290
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,465
That's right.

291
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,400
I spent most of my youth
following pirates

292
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,402
and I barely survived.

293
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,072
It's your turn.

294
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,575
Tell me about this
Doctorine person.

295

[CHOPPER gasps]

296
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,412
You were talking
about her earlier.

297
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,914
She's a doctor, right?

298
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,081
She's your teacher.

299
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,416
A mentor perhaps?

300
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,518
Uh, yeah, kinda.

301
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,087
Doctorine is someone
I owe a great debt to.

302
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,190
Most people refer
to her as Dr. Kureha.

303
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,992
[ROBIN]
Dr. Kureha.

304
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:27,860
What is she like?

305
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,328
[CHOPPER]
She really loves alcohol,

306
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,096
but the best way to
describe her is a woman

307
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,998
who's like a pirate,
who's also a doctor.

308
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,434
Did I mention she
really loves alcohol?

309
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,948
[CHOPPER] I studied under
Doctorine for about six years.

310
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,516
I wanted to be a doctor
myself, you know.

311
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,351
That was my passion.

312
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,223
"After mixing these three
types of herbs together

[KUREHA] Are you finished
with your reading?

317
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,169
I expect all
500 pages memorized.

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,508
Ha! You were playing around
with my medicines again.

320
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,677
[CHOPPER]
No! I was experimenting!

321
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,679
[KUREHA]
That's the same as playing.

322
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,314
B‐But I...

323
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,983
No excuses!

324
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,252
But‐‐I've been studying for
three years now, Dr. Kureha!

325
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,155
I've read and re‐read over 200
medical books and journals.

Please let me help
prepare the medicine!

You're about a hundred
years from that!

[CHOPPER screams]

329
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,333
I‐I've memorized every single
word that I've ever read!

It's true! I swear it!

331
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,770
I even managed to memorize

cover‐to‐cover!

That's the one you said
was the most difficult book

00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,042
you ever read!

You okay?

344
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,700
It seems I've been infected
with the febrile disease

345
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,136
from the patient
I saw the other day.

346
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,538
You're burning up!

347
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,539
Chopper.

348
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,374
Anyone can memorize words,

349
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,445
but now you must put what
you've learned to the test.

350
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,448
I guess this will make me
your very first patient.

352
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,485

You're on your own.

354
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,122
If you fail, I'll die.

355
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,091
No pressure.

356
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,759
Learn the ultimate lesson.

357
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,761
Once you decide to
practice medicine,

358
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,431
you take the responsibility
of your patients' lives

359
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,432
in your hooves.

360
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,668
Can a blue‐nose reindeer
master such a burden?

361
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,737
[KUREHA chuckles]

362
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,238
[CHOPPER gasps]

363
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,791
There's no mistake!

364
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,427
This is the pathogen
of the Mondolin Virus.

365
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,097
What would work best
to counteract it?

366
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,599
Found it!

367
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,171
Doctorine...

368
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,440
[CHOPPER]
...don't die.

369
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,808
Please!

370
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,284
Let's see.

371
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,820
Dr. Kureha,

372
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,456
aren't ya gonna ask what sort
of ingredients I combined?

373
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,825
Most patients will have
little knowledge of medicine,

374
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,228
or what is used to compound it.

375
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,163
They simply trust
their doctor's judgment

376
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,466
and abide by whatever
prescription he gives them.

377
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,537
All right.

378
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,139
Do you feel a little better?

379
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:03,642
Dummy. No medicine
works instantaneously.

380
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,411
Go. I need to sleep for awhile.

381
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,564
[KUREHA]
Chopper!

382
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,166
[gasps]

383
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,033
[KUREHA]
Not a bad job,

384
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,203
considering your
lack of experience.

385
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,340
[CHOPPER] That was the
first time that Doctorine

386
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,177
truly praised my
aptitude in medicine.

387
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,178
And it was the only time

388
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,514
throughout the six years
I worked under her.

389
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,683
Instead of giving me
verbal acknowledgments,

390
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,886
she proved her faith in me by
placing her life in my hands.

391
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,421
That's Doctorine for ya.

392
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,690
She believes in
actions, not words.

393
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,358
And I agree with her.

394
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,294
Someday I'll become
a great doctor,

395
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,796
one that'll surprise even her.

396
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,203
Oh, no! I think I said too much!

397
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,305
[gasps] Hey!

398
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,539
[ROBIN]
The sun will be setting soon.

399
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,907
We should go.

400
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
I wish I had someone in my life

401
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,712
who I had a strong
connection with...

402
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,814
...just like you do.

403
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,889
[CHOPPER]
This is really... heavy!

404
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,758
[CHOPPER grunts]

405
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:42,941
Go on.

406
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,743
Explain to me why you
weren't able to gather

407
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,646
so much as a single
piece of fruit!

408
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,680
That's a good question.

409
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,349
What's your answer?

410
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,417
Look, I thought
I was being attacked...

411
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,853
...by a huge condor who was
trying to claw my face off!

412
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,821
[yells]

413
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,422
Sorry I failed you!

414
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,991
I tried my best! I really did!

415
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,260
But I guess, in the end,
it wasn't good enough!

416
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,628
And now I'm dead!

417
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,929
[groans]

418
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,297
I have to hand it to you, Zoro.

419
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,698
You did an impressive job today!

[ZORO grunts]

421
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,934
So impressive
that you should just

422
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,936
keep working the
rest of the night!

423
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,137
Ahh!

424
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,340
How lovable Nami is, even when
she's yelling at everyone!

425
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,275
Oh, shut up!

426
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,276
You're a moron!

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,011
You want some of me, Moss Head?

00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,445

00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,719
Oh, I can't remember
the last time

433
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,721
we had a nice, peaceful
day like this!

Hey, Chopper!

00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,458
Was it tough being alone
all day on the ship?

436
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,393
Kinda.

437
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,295
It was a chore.

438
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,635
But, way more fun than
I've had in a long time!
