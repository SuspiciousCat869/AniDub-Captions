179
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,009
[BOTH] Huh?

180
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,844
Well, give my thanks to
your mother for the drink.

181
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,312
[MICHAEL]
You're leaving already?

182
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,682
Sorry, but there's not much
reason for me to stay. So--

183
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,317
[yells]

184
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,486
[BABY yells]

185
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Uh! Ngh!

186
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,088
Up we go.

187
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,723
Nice catch, Big Bro!

188
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,425
[BABY crying]

189
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,327
Big Bro!

190
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,995
[crying]

191
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,229
[grunts]

[KIDS clapping]

193
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,766
Looks like you're
a natural at that.

194
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,603
I told you he'd make an
awesome big brother, didn't I?

195
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,705
[grunts]

196
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,539
[yells]

197
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,340
He pissed all over me!

198
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,175
Ugh! Ugh!

199
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,043
Careful! Careful!

200
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,812
Here. Go change his diaper.

201
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,146
[HOICHAEL] Right!

202
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,148
Are you some kind of
pervert? What are you doing?

203
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,618
I'm gonna give it a wash.
Wear this until it dries.

204
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,956
This... must be a nightmare.

205
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,091
He's all yours. All right!

206
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,728
Everyone do your best
to finish up your chores!

207
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,295
[KIDS] Yeah!

208
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,103
Hey, Hoichael!

209
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,338
Listen. I'm sorry,
but I just can't--

210
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,979
Hey! No! Stop!

211
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,580
[giggles]

212
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,017
Michael, help me out.

213
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,118
I need you to do
something with these...

214
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,721
Huh?

215
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:35,161
[ZORO winces, coughs]

216
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,735
[ZORO] Come on.

217
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,539
Hoichael! Michael!
Where'd you go?

218
00:11:47,508 --> 00:11:48,842
Hm?!

219
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,345
You're doing
good work around here.

220
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,712
Keep it up, son.

221
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,121
[ZORO] All right.

222
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,259
There.
You three sleep quietly now.

223
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,596
[WOMAN humming]

224
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,898
Hey. Gimme my shirt.

225
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,001
I appreciate you cleaning it,
but it's time for me to go.

226
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,435
What are you talking about?

227
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,471
You sayin' you've got
somewhere you'd rather be

228
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,405
than right here?

229
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,741
Yeah. I need to
rejoin my friends.

230
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,108
Come on!

231
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,144
Who's more important:
your family or your friends?

232
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,646
We're not family.

233
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,115
You didn't give birth to me
and we're not related by blood.

234
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,850
So cut the crap
and gimme back my shirt.

235
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,985
Shut your mouth!

236
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,419
Who cares if we're
not blood related?

237
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,823
What's so important about
a stupid blood bond, anyway?

238
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,390
[door opens]

239
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,229
I've got another matter
I need to discuss with you.

240
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,931
You were just
here two days ago.

241
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,332
I was here
the day before that,

242
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,468
and yesterday, too,
dammit! I won't give up!

243
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,937
Eh? And who is this?

244
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,371
I don't recall
seeing you before.

245
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,840
A new family member, perhaps?

246
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:53,840
--[WOMAN] That's right.
--[ZORO] Hell no.

247
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,242
Which is it?!

248
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,643
Who cares? It doesn't matter.

249
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,480
Listen, I'm wise to that
Paulie guy from Galley-La.

250
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:01,948
Ya know, he can't keep covering
for you forever, Auntie.

251
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,150
There's nothing to cover!

252
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,584
I returned the loan, didn't I?

253
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,852
You fool!

254
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,855
That loan generated interest
the moment you borrowed it.

255
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,422
That interest
generated more interest,

256
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,324
raising the total owed
to ten times the amount

257
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,060
you borrowed from us
in the beginning.

258
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,329
I returned the loan.
What else do ya' want?

259
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,097
That interest is yours to pay.

260
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:19,633
Dammit! That's not
how this works!

261
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,470
It's quite the fiscal
burden to take on a loan.

262
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:26,841
Maybe you could sell off one of
these kids to lighten the load.

263
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,576
After all, it's not
like they're really

264
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,977
part of your family, right?

265
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,412
What did you say?

266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,848
Huh...?

267
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,217
[ZORO]
Now that he's mentioned it,

268
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,352
none of them look alike at all!

[LOANSHARK 318A groans]

270
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,225
Hey! That hurt!

271
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,861
What the hell are you trying
to pull here, Auntie?

272
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,495
Talk about my family again,

273
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,631
I'll knock
your head off! Got it?

274
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,198
[LOANSHARK 318A] Shoot her!

[LOANSHARKS whimper]

277
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,741
Well then! I've said
what I had to say,

278
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,009
so now we'll be off!

00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,109

Way to go, Big Bro!

00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,786
Good boy! You've made
your momma happy!

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,522
Right! Let's finish
the shopping,

287
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:15,623
then go home for dinner!

[KIDS] Yay!

00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,192
Well... Guess I'll
get going then.

290
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,229
Yeah, you're going.

291
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,565
Along with us, that is. Come on!

[panting]

295
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,708
[MAN] I assume you
have some work for me?

296
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,144
[laughs intensely]

297
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,871
Come on! You call
that a discount?

298
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,473
We'll have to take our
business elsewhere

299
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:07,274
if you can't come up
with a better offer.

300
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,043
Can't you two
stay out of trouble?

301

Ughhh. No matter how I
look at it, this is just wrong.

302

What am I doing here?

303
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,450
I'll sneak away the first
chance I get, then I'll--

[yells]

305
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,322
Crap!

to show up, stupid cook?

[grunts]

308
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,528
Then that would make
this way a shortcut, right?

Thanks for your help.

310
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,568

I can't run anymore.

Ha. You could say that.

319
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,831
I don't even know how I
let myself get into this mess.

320

322
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,635
Now, listen--

00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,472

327
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,914
You don't have to
worry about anything.

00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:21,815
Your secret is safe with me.

329
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,653
And, to be honest,
it suits you.

332
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,131
I've had enough!
I'm outta here!

333
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,301
What's that?
You wanna head back?

334
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,135
Fine, then let me
give you the house key.

335
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,637
Make sure you
clean the toilets.

No! Look, I'm not
going back to your house!

00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,075
I'm gonna go back
to where my friends are!

338
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,910
Stop talking that
crazy nonsense!

339
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,645
You're the crazy one, lady!

340
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,913
Show some respect!

341
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,748
How dare you speak to
your mother that way!

342
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:55,816
You're not my mom!

343
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:56,716
Shut up!

344
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,051
Rude little broccoli head!

345
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,987
It's not broccoli!
It's moss!

00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,722
Ah! He's a moss head!

347
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,024
Big Bro the moss head!

00:17:03,057 --> 00:17:04,658
[KIDS] Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

349
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,193
[ZORO grunts] Look, you brats!

350
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:08,362
I'm not a moss head!

351
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,297
I'm outta here.

352
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:12,032
[KIDS] Mm?

353
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,536
Just as I'd expect
from the eldest son.

354
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,573
Michael, Hoichael. Be sure
to bring him back later.
