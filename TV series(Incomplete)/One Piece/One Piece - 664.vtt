00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.939
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.116
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.755
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:46.065
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:51.877
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.814
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.219
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:59.259
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.400
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.044
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.386
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.595
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.835
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.440
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.078
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:28.684
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament that

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:31.890
promises the Flame Flame Fruit
to the champion.

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:34.563
Meanwhile, the Toy Soldier
and the Tontatta Tribe

00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:37.869
are having a rally
underneath Dressrosa.

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:39.840
Dressrosa SOP!

00:03:39.873 --> 00:03:42.244
[DWARVES gasping]

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:43.982
The one who turned us into toys

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:47.421
is a member of
Doflamingo's inner circle.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:49.459
We'll target them
and shut down the power

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.162
of their Hobby Hobby Fruit.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.032
"Hobby Hobby" what?

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.903
We simply have
to knock them out.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:57.909
[gasps] And doing so will
break the spell on the toys?

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.077
That's correct!

00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.284
All of the toys will return
to their human forms--

00:04:02.318 --> 00:04:05.123
in the secret factory
and the streets alike!

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:08.096
I see. But we can avoid
a conflict with Trebol

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.199
just as long as we
can knock out Sugar.

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:13.306
That's correct! The plan is
to scare her out of her wits

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.179
and make her pass out!
Operation...

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:19.686
Sugar! Over-surprised! Panic!

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.355
It's you...

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.193
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:28.637
[LUFFY gasping]

00:04:29.806 --> 00:04:34.214
[LUFFY] But all this time...
he was out there.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:42.798
[LUFFY] "Operation SOP Starts!
Usoland Charges Forth!"

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:58.664
[LUFFY]
Ow...

00:04:58.697 --> 00:05:00.769
[ZORO] How long are you
gonna keep crying?

00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:03.273
[LUFFY]
I can't help it...

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:04.843
[LUFFY sobs]

00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:06.513
[KIN'EMON] I've never seen
Sir Luffy shed such

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:09.018
unrelenting tears! He must
be profoundly touched

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.322
to find his friend alive
after all this time!

00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:13.159
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:16.298
[ZORO] Why have I never heard
of him? Who is this guy?

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.436
[LUFFY]
He's... my brother...

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:20.842
[ZORO]
Huh?! Your brother?

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:22.478
[KIN'EMON]
I was not aware that Sir Luffy

00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:23.947
possessed any siblings!

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.754
[ZORO] Wait. You're not talkin'
about Ace, are you?

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:29.125
Does that mean he's
still alive, somehow?

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.529
All those years ago...!

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.934
[ZORO]
Answer my question, damn it!

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.342
[inaudible]

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.470
[ACE]
We may sail in different seas,

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:11.141
with different crews
on different ships,

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:14.615
but wherever we go and
whatever adventures we have,

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:18.657
we'll always be brothers, and
nobody can take that away.

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:21.462
[LUFFY]
Heh!

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:24.502
From now on, we're honest
to goodness brothers.

00:06:24.535 --> 00:06:26.171
Cheers to that!

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:35.357
[laughs] It's just like
Ace said back then,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.960
we all went our separate ways,

00:06:36.994 --> 00:06:39.264
but we never stopped
being brothers!

00:06:39.297 --> 00:06:41.736
[ZORO]
Okay, but who is this guy?

00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:54.929
All right! Is everybody ready?

00:06:54.963 --> 00:06:56.900
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:58.704
[KYROS] We'll sneak into
the underground port

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:01.543
by taking the hidden passage
from our current location.

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:06.252
We should avoid conflict
and aim only for our target,

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:07.922
Sugar!

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:10.928
She may seem harmless,
but she's quite deadly!

00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:12.966
All we have to do
is knock her out.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:16.439
Then every toy in the kingdom
will become human once more!

00:07:16.473 --> 00:07:18.209
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:07:18.242 --> 00:07:22.351
After that, we must also free
our captive Tontatta friends

00:07:22.384 --> 00:07:25.858
and return King Riku
to power at long last!

00:07:25.892 --> 00:07:27.929
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:30.968
At the lead...
The Yellow Cub Squad!

00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:33.974
With the Pink Bee Squad
right at their side!

00:07:35.945 --> 00:07:38.048
Onward!

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:40.220
Let's see if you can
keep up with me!

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:43.627
[DWARVES cheering]

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:03.299
There's no turning back now!

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:06.139
Yeah, I know! I mean,
you say that,

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:11.115
and I get it, but the path
forward is kind of, uh...

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:13.019
...narrow.

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:15.692
It's gonna be a tight
squeeze. I think!

00:08:15.725 --> 00:08:18.062
How the heck am I gonna fit?

00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:19.833
Fraland. Right.

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:22.404
Just disconnect your arms?
And your shoulders, maybe?

00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:26.747
'Kay. Arms and shoulders,
off. Yeah, right!

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.686
Hey! I'm sure that passage
of yours is real super,

00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:30.921
but Me-Land can't fit.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:33.694
Sorry. We just didn't
build it for big people.

00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:35.831
Or for extra-big people.

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:38.403
You'll have to enter through
the Toy House, instead.

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:39.672
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.244
[KYROS] The Toy House is located
at the base of the plateau

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:44.214
that the palace is built on.

00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:48.289
That's where the toys must
return to every night.

00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:50.427
Humans aren't allowed to enter.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.268
I see. And you call it a "house"
'cause the toys live there?

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.272
[KYROS]
No. It's a house in name only.

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:59.044
There are no beds
for sleeping there.

00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:02.150
Only a hidden passage,
leading downward to the port.

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:03.588
[FRANKY]
What for?

00:09:03.621 --> 00:09:05.056
Without a moments rest,

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.595
the toys are forced
underground every night,

00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:10.166
and slave away
until the morning comes.

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:13.707
[gasps] So those toys in the
city have to put on a show

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.213
all day, after slaving
away all night?

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:19.619
[KYROS] Indeed. Such is
the fate of all those

00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:23.827
who Doflamingo captures.
The Tontatta included.

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:34.549
[FRANKY cries] The poor things!
What a cruel fate!

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:39.660
Well, anyway. So you
said Fraland can get to

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:41.730
the SMILE factory
through the Toy House?

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:45.470
Correct. There are four ways in.

00:09:45.504 --> 00:09:49.144
However, all of them
are tightly guarded.

00:09:49.178 --> 00:09:51.650
[FRANKY] That's suits me
just fine, little buddy.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:52.818
[KYROS]
Hm?

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:57.127
See, while I'm there,
I'll raise some hell for ya!

00:09:57.161 --> 00:09:58.062
Huh?

00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.266
But aren't we sneaking in?

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.005
[FRANKY] You're sneakin' in.
That's the point. Get it?

00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:04.141
[KYROS]
Huh?

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:06.012
[FRANKY] While I'm drawin'
everyone's attention,

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:09.519
you slip in all quiet-like
and take down Sugar.

00:10:26.118 --> 00:10:28.857
Huh? Who is that weirdo?

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.359
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
Where are his pants?!

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:33.032
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
What's wrong with his head?

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:37.173
Does it shoot?

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:40.213
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Maybe he's just crazy!

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:44.054
Uh! He's got a triple-chin, too!

00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:46.693
Wait a second! We know this guy!

00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:49.565
It's Cyborg Franky
from the Straw Hats!

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:50.634
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D]
He's right!

00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:53.239
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Hey, Señor! Take a look!

00:11:00.319 --> 00:11:01.823
Oh, no! Señor!

00:11:01.856 --> 00:11:04.194
You can't just bite right
into a tomato like that!

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:07.535
You need a napkin.
It's too juicy!

00:11:07.568 --> 00:11:09.104
[WOMAN A shrieks]

00:11:16.754 --> 00:11:19.491

Oh, Señor!

00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.667

You're so hard-boiled!

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.042
Get off of me, ladies.
That's enough.

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:30.981
You'd be better off
with a man your own age!

00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:32.852
But we like you!

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:36.158
Don't turn us away! Señor!

00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:42.605
Sorry. I don't... like kids.

00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:45.544

Ohh! Señor!

00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:47.413

Please let us stay, Señor!

Get a load of that pervert!

00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:57.801

You're one to talk!

00:11:57.835 --> 00:11:59.004
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
Attention! This is the

east entrance to the
Toy House, reporting!

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.545
We're under enemy attack!

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:05.450
Knock, knock! Lemme in!

[FRANKY]
Weapons left!

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.604
Shoot him!

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.474
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
It's a member of the Straw Hats!

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:19.211
Cyborg Franky is here!

...Vent!

00:12:28.731 --> 00:12:34.307
[PIRATES screaming]

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:43.627
[DOFLAMINGO]
What did I tell you?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.767
Those guys're out of control.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.772
This nation is affiliated
with the World Government.

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:52.377
It's your job to help me.

00:12:55.784 --> 00:12:58.690
[FUJITORA]
Excuse me for a moment.

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:02.899

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.969

00:13:19.364 --> 00:13:23.741
Toy House, huh? Sounds messy.

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:28.049
[laughs] Don't worry!
We already know their objective.

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:30.253
The SMILE Factory!

00:13:30.286 --> 00:13:34.729
And you know what happens
if they make it that far?

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:36.699
What?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:40.974
[TREBOL] We turn them all into
toys! That sound good to you?

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:41.977

Mm.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.783
[laughs] They're so clueless!

00:13:44.816 --> 00:13:47.421
Dummies! You're our secret!

00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:51.697
They sure will be surprised,
won't they?

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.600
I guess so.

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:21.088
[KYROS] We're almost at
the trade port. Get ready!

00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:25.965
[USOPP]
Sorry to impose.

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.969
Nah, we don't mind one bit!

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:30.674
It's no trouble to help
our hero, Usoland!

00:14:30.707 --> 00:14:32.878
[BOTH]
We're honored!

00:14:32.912 --> 00:14:34.215
[chuckles]

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.084
Commander! It's Fraland!

00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:38.924
He's wreaking havoc at the
Toy House, just as promised!

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:40.226
Got it!

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:44.502
See, while I'm there,
I'll go raise some hell for ya!

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:46.438
I hope he stays safe.

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.842
He'll be fine!

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:50.280
Fraland's a super
cyborg, after all!

00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:51.482
[KYROS]
Be that as it may,

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.154
I just received word that four
of the Family executives

00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:56.058
have been sent to guard
the Toy House!

00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:57.595
[USOPP]
Is that bad?

00:14:57.628 --> 00:15:00.500
They are fearsome,
skilled fighters.

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.805
All members of
the Diamante Army.

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.709
They're strong, huh?

00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:06.980
They're the biggest stars
in the whole coliseum!

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:09.118
In fact, in all the matches
that they've fought,

00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:10.320
they've never lost once.

00:15:10.353 --> 00:15:12.256
And that goes for
all four of them, too.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.194
That's a heck of a record.

00:15:14.228 --> 00:15:15.864
Aren't the fighters
in the coliseum

00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:17.502
supposed to be tough, though?

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:19.839
[KYROS] They are.
Which means one thing...

00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:23.345
[FRANKY yelling]

00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:29.091
[KYROS] We still don't know
the true limits

00:15:29.124 --> 00:15:30.994
of our enemy's strength.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.148
Heh. This Franky guy's tough,

00:15:41.182 --> 00:15:44.254
but he doesn't notice Señor
coming up from behind!

00:15:47.326 --> 00:15:49.397
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasping]

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:55.911
[SEÑOR]
Are you blind, or just stupid?

00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:59.919
Huh? Listen. No hiding in
the pavement on my watch!

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:01.856
Now how 'bout a Strong Right?

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.494
[PIRATES screaming]

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.304
[ALL] Why the hell did you
swim out in front of him?

00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:10.741
He was done for!

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:12.811
[WOMEN]
Señor Pink!

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:27.575
[SEÑOR] Why would I challenge
the enemy head-on, you ask?

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:29.679
'Cause there's only
one thing a man does

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:32.283
behind someone else's back.

00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:42.070
And that's unzipping
a lady's dress for her.

00:16:42.103 --> 00:16:46.211
[WOMEN]
Oh! Señor! So hard boiled!

00:16:46.245 --> 00:16:50.687
Of course, the only time
a man stands in front...

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.060
...is when he's stealing
a kiss from a lady's lips.

00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:56.231
[WOMEN]
Oh! You're too much!

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.336
[ALL]
Oh, Señor. You're so manly!

00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:02.443
"Manly"? You guys
are super stupid! Huh?

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:11.227
You're creepin' me out.
Your power is weird!

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:21.816
So, just how many tough
guys are we up against?

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:25.222
There's ten executives,
each leading 2,000 men,

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:28.261
spread out across
the entire kingdom.

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:30.099
Then, there's three
top executives

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.003
that stand above even them.

00:17:32.036 --> 00:17:37.615
Each of three command their
own army, with unique features.

00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:41.589
First, the Trebol Army members
all have special abilities.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.561
[LEO]
Like, Sugar!

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:49.337
[LEO]
Violet!

00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:53.846
[LEO]
And Giolla!

00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:00.426
[LEO]
Next, there's the Diamante Army,

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:03.800
consisting of strong fighters.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.708
Like Lao G.!

00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:11.348
Machvise!

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:13.318
Señor Pink!

00:18:15.957 --> 00:18:17.761
[LEO]
And Dellinger!

00:18:21.302 --> 00:18:25.744
And then, there's Pica--
with his commando unit.

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:30.920
[LEO]
He commands Gladius!

00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:35.295
[LEO]
Buffalo and Baby 5!

00:18:39.137 --> 00:18:41.809
Yeah, we fought with those
last two before we got here.

00:18:41.843 --> 00:18:43.746
And they were tough.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.293
[inaudible]

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:54.468
There's two more who
are operating overseas.

00:18:54.502 --> 00:18:58.141
Another top exec: Vergo.

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:01.683
And a regular exec: Monet.

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:04.387
Okay, but our only target
is Sugar, right?

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.561
She's from the team
with the special powers?

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:09.866
[LEO]
Mm. That's right!

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:10.901
[sighs]

00:19:10.934 --> 00:19:12.103
[USOPP] So we don't
have to face the team

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:14.474
with all the strong fighters!
That's on Franky!

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:17.682
That team may be the most
deadly of them all!

00:19:17.715 --> 00:19:20.887
[grunts] Why'd you
have to tell me that?

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.494
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:37.821
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:19:38.924 --> 00:19:41.261
Meadows is done for!

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:42.598
[CROWD chattering]

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.169
[GYATS] And he took a whole
bunch of competitors with him!

00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:47.641
Rebecca is really
whittling them down!

00:19:47.674 --> 00:19:49.210
But after teaming up
with Agilia,

00:19:49.244 --> 00:19:52.551
she's even less
popular than usual!

00:19:52.585 --> 00:19:56.157
Surely someone has the
power to take her down!

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.268
[GYATS]
Suleiman the Beheader steps up!

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.907
Will his deadly blade
find its mark?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.777
Or will Rebecca prevail again

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.581
with her Back-to-
the-Water Dance?

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:09.117
[SULEIMAN grunts]

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.807
[REBECCA yells]

00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:23.546
[REBECCA gasps]

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:27.487
Rebecca!

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:30.960
[GYATS] Ah! He fended off
her signature technique!

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:40.880
We've made it!

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:53.472
[LEO]
Oh, no! I'm sorry, Usoland!

00:20:53.507 --> 00:20:54.441
Thank you.

00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:56.111
[MALE DWARF B]
My pleasure!

00:20:56.144 --> 00:20:59.017
Are you ready?
We're in the enemy base.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.989
The factory is right over there.

00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:04.761
Oh, yeah?

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.837
Well, that would explain
all the factory noise.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.205
[ROBIN gasps]

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.128
All right, I'm heading
straight for the palace.

00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:22.832
You can handle Sugar.

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.571
Roger! We won't fail!

00:21:25.604 --> 00:21:27.808
[KYROS] I'm coming for you,
Doflamingo!

00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:31.281
I swear I'll take you down,
even if it kills me!

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:32.584
[whirring]

00:21:32.618 --> 00:21:35.556
That must be coming
from above, right?

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.395
[PIRATE B] Hey, who dropped
this box? Pull it together!

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:40.534
[PIRATE C]
Aw, it fell on top of a toy.

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:43.138
[TOY MAN B]
I... I'm sorry!

00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:45.944
I'll keep working!
Just let me see my family!

00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:47.112
[PIRATE B]
Your family?!

00:21:47.146 --> 00:21:49.451
The only thing you're gonna
see is the scrap heap!

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:50.621
Now take 'im away!

00:21:50.654 --> 00:21:51.922
[TOY MAN B]
Anything but that!

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:54.562
I can still make my quota!
Have mercy!

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:57.333
[whimpering]

00:21:57.367 --> 00:21:58.769
Over here.

00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:02.443
Robin, did you--?

00:22:02.476 --> 00:22:05.650
Shh! Just look.

00:22:05.683 --> 00:22:06.919
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:22:15.804 --> 00:22:16.873
[TOY MEN groaning]

00:22:16.906 --> 00:22:18.275
You're in for it now!

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:19.678
[whimpering]

00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:22.217
If you don't like it,

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.287
we'll just do business
with someone else!

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.725
You know that is a rotten deal!

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:29.898
I'd clean your clock,
if it wasn't for Joker!

port city down here!

[NARRATOR] The toy soldier
races toward Doflamingo

00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:19.765
while Rebecca struggles
valiantly in the colosseum.

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:22.403
With their thoughts of one
another keeping them strong,

00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:24.742
both warriors do
their best to survive.

00:23:24.775 --> 00:23:26.546
However, the weary
Rebecca finds herself

00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:28.616
in grave danger when Suleiman

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.054
unleashes his
overwhelming poxwer!

00:23:31.088 --> 00:23:32.724

On the next One Piece!

Rebecca vs. Suleiman!"
