I thought Lost Island sank
into the sea a long time ago.

Lost Island will surface

certain about that.

Grandpa believes the island
will reappear any day now.

But he can no longer
remember where it used to be.

It's not his fault.

Grandpa's just gotten old
and lost the energy to fly.

They're blockading the harbor
and coming ashore!

Oh, no! We've got to get
to Apis before they do!

00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,414
Why are the Marines
after a little girl?

What do we do with the old man?

00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,925
[NAMI] Well... it looks
like he's sound asleep,

85
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,928
so I think we should
just leave him be.

tell him not to worry.

accompany me onto the island!

those Millennial Dragons

Hey! Let's see if he can fetch!

99
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,809
He's a dragon, not a puppy!

100
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,978
I guess the closer you
get to the Grand Line,

101
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,414
the more you run into
things like this.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,517
Well, if things like those Sea
Kings we encountered can exist,

103
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,687
I guess anything's possible.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,655
Oh no. Are we safe
around this thing?!

105
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,724
Will he try to eat us?!

106
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,364
Um, normally he doesn't eat
people, but he is forgetful.

107
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,434
If he starts acting like
you're food, get away quick.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,602
Now you tell me!

109
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,504
It doesn't hurt though, does it?

111
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,842
Don't worry about it,
I think he likes you.

112
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,510
[USOPP] That's easy
for you to say, Luffy!

113
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,579
You're not the one with
your head in his mouth!

114
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,381

Maybe we should let 'em eat you.

[USOPP]
Zoro!

116
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,717

[USOPP]
Why, you lousy! I oughta‐‐!

119
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,862
Anyways, this dragon is
the reason why the Marines

120
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,964
have been chasing after Apis.

121
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,100
We can't let the Marines
get their hands on him.

122
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,602
I brought you here because
we need to help Apis

123
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,704
take him back to his
home on Lost Island.

124
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:12,905
Are you nuts?!

125
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,807
In case you forgot, Nami,
the Marines are after us too!

126
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,908
With that blockade,

127
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,710
we're gonna have enough
trouble escaping ourselves,

00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,811

ginormous lizard!

Please, listen!

00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,049
Grandpa Ryu just
wants to go home.

131
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,951
Luffy said...

132
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,986
Wait, don't tell me.
Luffy said something like,

133
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,122
"Sure! We'll take him
to the Lost Island!"

134
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,391
[LUFFY]
Hey! How'd you know I said that?

135
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,394
Ah! You always
say stuff like that!

136
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,795
Without asking us first!

137
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,731
And without having a clue
how to find the place!

138
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,733
[LUFFY]
Ah, we'll work it out somehow.

139
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,402
Oh, please!

140
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,836
It's okay, Grandpa Ryu.

141
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,671
I'll find another way
to get you home,

142
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,608
and I won't let those
Marines get you.

143
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,611
The problem is we don't really
know where Lost Island is,

144
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,846
but the dragon should have
migratory instincts,

145
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,748
which'll help us find it.

146
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,584
Yeah! So what are we
waitin' for? Let's get goin!

147
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,086
But, Luffy‐‐

148

[ZORO]
Hey. Don't worry.

149
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,588
We'll work it out.

150
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,690
[USOPP]
Zoro!

151
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,426
I agree, but first things first.

152
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,994
How are we supposed to
bring our big friend here

153
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,663
down the mountain and
onto the Going Merry?

154
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,467
Heh. It's easy we're
gonna build a cart.

155
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,770
One big enough for Grandpa
Ryu to ride. Let's move.

156
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,439

[LUFFY] Hmm...
Do you think that's enough?

160
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,816
Yep! That's good.

161
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,219
Well, I guess I better start
slappin' this thing together,

162
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,821
not that I have any real choice!

163
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,230
That's it, guys!
It's finally done!

164
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,764

It's so strong and sturdy

165
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,933
even Grandpa Ryu
couldn't break it!

Uh‐huh!

Speaking of breaking,

169
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,873
how are we supposed to get
through that Marine blockade?

170
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,908
And back to the ship?

171
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,010
I dunno. We'll work
it out somehow.

172
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,178
[SANJI]
Yeah, but how?

173
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,779
[ZORO]
An attack?

174
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,681
You know, that's not a bad idea.

175
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,782
[NAMI]
Yeah, but that's impossible

176
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,718
with a giant dragon in tow.

177
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,852
I've got a better idea,

178
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,221
but it's gonna require more
stealth than strength.

179
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,856
One of us has to
go to the harbor,

180
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,091
sneak aboard the Going Merry,

181
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,527
and sail it to the
rear of the island.

182
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,228
[USOPP] Well, since my good,
personal friend Kaya

183
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,130
gave us the ship,
I should be the one to go!

184
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,732
[APIS]
He's so brave!

185
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,901
[USOPP] However,
Zoro is coming with me!

186
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,602
[ZORO]
Me? Why?

187
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,770
[NAMI]
That's fine by me.

188
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,038
[USOPP chuckles]

189
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,073
[USOPP] Great! Nightfall is
when we should move out, Zoro!

190
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,109
[NAMI]
No, now!

191
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,878
[NAMI]
We're running out of time!

192
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,214
Get the ship and bring it
to the edge of that cape.

193
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,049
The one that looks
like your nose!

194
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,083
[LUFFY laughs]

195
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,153
Oh, that's funny!
It does look like his nose.

196
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,556
Okay, but that still
doesn't explain how you're‐‐

197
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,057
[NAMI]
Leave that to me.

198
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,759
This cave seems
pretty well‐hidden,

199
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,562
but those Marines will
find it sooner or later.

200
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,963
Get moving, you two!

201
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,098
[USOPP] For a navigator,
you sure give a lotta orders!

202
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:29,168
[NAMI] Sanji! Luffy! You guys
get Grandpa Ryu on the cart!

203
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:29,902
[LUFFY]
Right!

204
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,337
[SANJI]
Whatever you say, Nami!

205
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,647
[LT. COMMANDER]
All right, old man! Spit it out!

206
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,282
Tell us where you're
hiding this girl!

207
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,785
He was... followed by the‐‐

208
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,955
Hey! Old man!

209
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:54,193
Huh? Oh yes. Did I
mention the 1231st king?

210
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,629
Uh... What are
you talking about?

211
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,764
[MARINE B]
Lieutenant Commander!

212
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,799
We found some tracks!

213
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,602
Looks like something was
dragged from the backyard!

214
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,474
[LT. COMMANDER]
Eric! Those tracks, is it them?!

215
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,845
I'd say so, and they appear
to be pretty fresh.

216
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,213
They lead up that mountain.

217
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,449
That must be where
they're hiding.

218
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,518
[LT. COMMANDER] Then that's
where we're going! Move out!

219
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,622
[USOPP yelps]

220
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,658
See! This is exactly why I
wanted to come at night!

221
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,496
What the heck are you doing?!

222
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,349
Meet me on the deck.

223
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,752
[USOPP]
Hey, wait! Hold up!

224
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,356
[clunking]

225
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,258
[MARINE C]
Hm? Halt!

226
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,595
[USOPP] Ah! Help, Zoro.
Anybody help...

227
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,529
It's a pirate!

228
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,998
Stop him! Fire!

229
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,242
[MARINE C]
What the hell?!

230
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,577
[MARINE D] There must be another
pirate onboard that ship!

231
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,845
[MARINE E]
Hurry! They're getting away!

232
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,015
[MARINE F] The wind's pulling it
out to sea! Grab the ladder!

233
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,350
[MARINE C]
It's too late!

234
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,685
[MARINE D]
Dammit!

235
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,225
What the‐‐?!

236
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:37,363
They're trying to ram us!
All hands, evasive action!

237
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,900
[USOPP] What?! You're gonna
ram 'em?! Are you insane?!

238
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,303
[MARINES yelling]

239
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,738
[MARINE G]
It's headed right for us!

240
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,540
[MARINE H]
Unfurl the sails!

241
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,910
[MARINE I]
It's too late! Brace for impact!

242
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,945
Follow those pirates!

243
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,580
[MARINES]
Yes, Sir!

244
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,983
[OFFICER]
Hoist the anchor!

245
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,321
[OFFICER]
Unfurl the sails!

246
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,826
[OFFICER]
I want those pirates' heads!

247
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,461
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

248
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,499
[NAMI]
Hmm...

249
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,473
[NAMI]
They made it!

250
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,580
O‐Oh no!

251
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,850
The bird told me that the
Marines are closing in!

252
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,657
They didn't waste any time.

253
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,025
They got here quicker
than I thought.

254
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,194
What are we gonna do?!
They're getting close!

255
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,196
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

256
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,731
Remember, we've got
these two with us.

257
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,837
[NAMI] Plus, we're about
to get outta here.

258
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,540
We just have to wait until the
Going Merry's reached that cape.

259
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,081
[ERIC]
Hm?

260
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,783
There she is!

261
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,721
Ah! What is that thing?!

262
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,590
[MARINE K]
It's a monster!

263
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,565
[ERIC] Dragonite, the Elixir of
Immortality. I finally found it.

264
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,800
Don't panic, men!

265
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,135
That beast is the Millennial
Dragon we've been looking for.

266
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,138
We can take it! We'll sneak up
closer and get the drop on it!

267
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,541
Let's make Commodore
Nelson proud!

268
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,909
[MARINES]
Yes, Sir!

269
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,583
[USOPP]
Come on, you stupid thing!

270
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,253
Why'd you have to a ruin an
otherwise flawless escape?!

271
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,255
[ZORO]
We haven't escaped. Not yet.

272
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,991
[USOPP]
Huh? Ah!

273
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,228
Faster, men! Overtake
and board that vessel!

274
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,831
[USOPP] Ah! Zoro!
I'm gonna man the rudder!

275
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,833
You go take care of
the sail! Go! Go!

276
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,234
[ZORO]
Right! I'm on it!

277
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,941
Man, that ship may be as big
as a whale, but it's fast!

278
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,516
[gasps]

279
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,619
No! Stop! Please don't
shoot Grandpa Ryu!

280
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,688
Apis!

281
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,123
No, wait!

282
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,663
[MARINES gasp]

283
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,598
I had a feeling if we
followed that brat,

284
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,034
she might possibly lead us
to some Dragonite.

285
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,702
But I never expected
to encounter

286
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,637
a living, breathing
Millennial Dragon.

287
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,205
This is quite the surprise.

288
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,309
She is no longer of any
importance to us now.

289
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,145
That dragon is now our priority!

290
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,015
Within it lies the key
to immortal life.

291
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,283
Fire!

292
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,155
No! Don't shoot!

293
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,995
[LUFFY]
Back at ya!

294
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,700
[MARINE A]
What the hell was that?

295
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,835
[MARINE B]
How did he deflect the bullets?

296
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,572
I see you have
Devil Fruit powers.

297
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,208
Uh‐huh. I'm a rubber man.

298
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,676
[MARINE C]
Rubber man?

299
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,844
[MARINE D]
Devil Fruit?

300
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,213
[MARINE E]
What's that?

301
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,748
‐‐Use‐‐!
‐‐Use your swords men!

302
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,817
Bullets won't work
against rubber!

303
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,219
[MARINES yelling]

304
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,187
Sanji!

305
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,589
Never fear, Nami!

306
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,995
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum Gatling!

307
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,701
[MARINE T screams]

308
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,036
[ERIC]
Hmm...

309
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,872
You call yourselves Marines?

310
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,075
What a joke. The whole
lot of you are pathetic.

311
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:58,717
A knife?

312
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,119
I dunno.

313
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,908
My name's Eric the
Whirlwind, Straw Hats.

314
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,912
I was hired by Commodore
Nelson of Branch 8.

315
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,414
I have no business with you.

316
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,149
That Millennial Dragon,
on the other hand,

317
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,717
is a different story.

318
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,751
Stand aside.

319
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,087
If you don't, you'll fall
victim to my wind slash,

320
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,889
the power of the
Sickle Sickle Fruit.

321
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,791
[SANJI]
Did he say "Sicko Sicko"?

322
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,892
[LUFFY]
I think.

323
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:40,926
[SANJI]
What do we do?

324
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,127
[LUFFY]
I dunno.

325
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,929
Hey, Nami!

326
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,098
Can we go now?

327
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,132
[NAMI]
Not yet!

328
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,734
[SANJI] Nami's gorgeous even
when she's checking

329
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,803
on Zoro and Usopp's progress!

330
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,805
[LUFFY]
I wish they'd hurry up!

331
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,941
Hey! Straw Hats!
Are you listening?!

332
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,109
Did you hear what I said?!

333
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,112
Yeah, we heard you.
You're Eric, the Sicko.

334
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,948
[ERIC]
No! I said "sickle," you moron.

335
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,451
Sickle like the sharp thing
that cuts, not sicko!

336
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,420
[LUFFY] Well, we're already
"sicko" hearing you talk!

337
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,154
[LUFFY laughs]

338
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,023
[growls]

339
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,191
Let's see how
much you laugh

340
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,026
after you've gotten
a taste of this.

341
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,094
[LUFFY]
Hm?

342
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,962
Sickle‐Sickle...

343
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,133
...Whirlwind!

344
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,938
What was that?!

345
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,007
His wind slash.
Creep really packs a punch.

346
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,209
[chuckles]

347
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,010
The winds I create
are just as sharp

348
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,146
as the keenest blades
in the world.

349
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,015
Even the fiercest fighters
don't stand a chance.

350
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,852
I can rip anyone to shreds
in a matter of seconds.

351
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,453
[ERIC laughing]

352
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:42,387
Let's get out of here!

353
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,490
Not yet! They're not ready.

354
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,994
Now, move it! That
dragon's mine! Stand down!

355
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,462
No way!

356
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,500
All right, don't move then.
It's your funeral, Rubber Boy.

357
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,169
What about now?! Well, Nami?!

358
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,404
[NAMI]
Finally! It's time!

359
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,141
Luffy! Sanji! Let's go!

360
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,143
We're on our way, Nami!

361
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:04,843
[ERIC]
What the‐‐?!

362
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,913
[SANJI]
We'll be right there!

363
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,017
Hey, Nami! This kick's
dedicated to you.

364
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,088
[APIS screaming]

365
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,023
[chuckles]

366
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,358
[ERIC]
No, you don't!

367
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,360
Now Gum‐Gum...

368
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,195
Sickle‐Sickle...

369
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,366
‐‐[LUFFY] Pistol!
‐‐[ERIC] Whirlwind!

370
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,039
Nice try.

371
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,941
[LUFFY]
Woohoo!

372
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,011
[APIS screaming]

373
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,281
We're gonna hit that rock!

374
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,182
Luffy!

375
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:48,086
And Gum‐Gum... Gatling!

376
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,567
This is stupid! It's crazy!
We're all gonna die!

377
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,203
Not if we keep our heads down!

378
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,407
[NAMI]
Take your own advice!

379
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,312
Yeah.

380
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:19,084
[LUFFY chuckles]

381
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,321
[LUFFY, APIS laughing]

382
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,256
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

383
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,799
[LUFFY]
Woo! Yeah!

384
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,110
[USOPP]
Nami wanted us to bring the ship

385
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,812
to the edge of that cape, right?

386
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,680
[ZORO]
That's what she said.

387
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,119
Just perfect!
We couldn't outrun 'em, huh?

388
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,854
[ZORO]
I guess not.

389
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,423
Well, I've been itchin'
for a fight anyway.

390
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,126
What the hell?! Ah!

391
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,365
‐‐[APIS] Faster! Faster!
‐‐[LUFFY] Woo!

392
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,667
[LUFFY]
Hold on!

393
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,804
[BOTH scream]

394
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,793
That crazy plan actually worked!

395
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,463
Well, he said he'd
work it out somehow!

396
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,731
[laughing]

397
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,899
I told ya so!

398
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,234
[laughs]

399
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,337
[OFFICER] After them!
Move! Capture that ship!

400
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,307
[MARINE Y] Sir, we can't!
Not with our main mast snapped!

401
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,976
And it's wedged against
the ship! We're stuck!

402
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,412
[OFFICER]
What?!

403
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,047
[USOPP]
That should do it.

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,515
[LUFFY]
Man, that ride was fun!

405
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,384
[APIS]
It sure was!

406
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,887
Sure you're okay
after that ride?

407
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,255
[APIS]
Mh‐hm.

408
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,223
Well, now that Grandpa
Ryu's all secure,

409
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,525
we can raise anchor.

410
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,193
Yeah!

411
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:12,998
We're goin' to Lost
Island, guys! Set sail!

412
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,199
[USOPP]
Uh‐huh. And where's that?

413
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,436
[LUFFY] Hmm...
That way? Or that way?

414
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,704
Or maybe it's behind us?

415
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:22,007
He wouldn't be able to find his
head if it wasn't screwed on.

416
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,376
Eh. We'll work
things out somehow.

417
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,079
I hope so 'cause
it's not on the charts.

418
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,213
Nami's gorgeous,

419
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,249
even when she doesn't
know where the ship is going!

420
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,051
[USOPP]
Oh, no.

421
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,273
[LUFFY] It's out there
somewhere, guys,

422
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,444
so let's go find Lost Island!

423
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,284
<i>♪All that's in my</i>

424
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,420

425
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,455
<i>As I face what I must do,</i>

426
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:13,425

427
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,993

431
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:33,178
<i>As I watch the sunrise,</i>

432
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,949
<i>What could be the reason,</i>

433
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,285

444
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,990
[USOPP]
Just where is this Lost Island?!

445
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,059
[LUFFY] Grandpa Ryu's
sleeping, so be quiet.

446
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,994
[USOPP] Eh, some help
he turned out to be.

447
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,463
[NAMI]
It's not on any of the charts.

448
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,565
[USOPP] Agh! There's another
ship in front of us!

449
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,967
[NAMI] What the‐‐?!
That's the Going Merry!

450
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,135
[ZORO]
Hey, could this be it?

451
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,138
[SANJI] Is this it? Is this
the legendary Lost Island?

452
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,673
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

453
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,476
"A Solitary Island
in the Distant Sea!

454
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,511
The Legendary Lost Island!"

455
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,180
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
