to piss me off.

172
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,506
The feeling's mutual.

173
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,810
Perhaps we'd be evenly matched
if I were a pathetic swordsman,

174
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:31,811
but I'm not.

175
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,181
My weapons are far nastier
than mere swords.

176
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,716
Take this one, for example.

177
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,857
[MR. 1]
Spiral Hollow!

178
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,231
Jeez, what are you?
An excavator?

179
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,700
[MR. 1]
An assassin, actually.

180
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,676
[ZORO] Sparks? Just how fast
are those blades spinning?

181
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,112
[ZORO]
Oh, no!

182
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,917
However, I don't mind
being called an excavator.

183
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,521
Because I'm going to be
digging out your organs.

184
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,225
[ZORO groans]

185
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,804
[groaning]

186
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,208
[MR. 1] There's only one thing
left for you after defeat.

187
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,077
Death!

188
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,979
[ZORO yells]

189
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,277
I'm surprised
you're still alive.

190
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:19,351
[ZORO]
I will not show my back to him.

191
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,023
What are you going to
fight with? Your hands?

192
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,363
Even if I tried to
explain it to you,

193
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:36,001
you wouldn't understand it
because you're not a swordsman.

194
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,371
Don't bother. I'm not
that interested.

195
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,110
[MR. 1]
Spar... Break!

196
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,817
[groaning]

197
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,063
[MR. 1]
Die in peace.

198
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,204
[ZORO] I've had bad luck
with stones today.

199
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,938
[LUFFY]
You guys go on ahead!

200
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
Don't worry about me!

201
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,842
Make sure you deliver Vivi home!

202
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,544
[ZORO]
Go! Keep heading to Alubarna!

203
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:01,086
[ZORO] I wonder... if the
rest of 'em... are okay.

204
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,261
[MR. 1]
Hm?

205
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:20,372
That's impossible. I cut
him so many times.

206
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,308
Did he dodge all those
falling stones?

207
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:33,218
[ZORO]
Is that what I did? Dodge them?

208
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,620
No.

209
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,456
I was just able to
sense the place

210
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,059
where no stones would fall.

211
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,998
[ZORO]
My swords...

212
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:51,070
One of 'em's underneath
that stone. I feel it.

213
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,405
[crumbling]

214
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,441
What is he doing?

215
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,919
[ZORO] I've experienced
this feeling before.

216
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,326
[ZORO] Everything goes
quiet around me.

217
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,264
So quiet... I can hear my
heartbeat so clearly.

218
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,301
[ZORO]
Is this...?

219
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:27,172
Is this what it feels like when
you're close to death?

220
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:32,044
It was almost like... like those
falling stones gave me a hint.

221
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,947
As if they were living things.

222
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,685
No, it wasn't a hint. It was
much clearer than that.

223
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,653
It was like...

224
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,489
...rhythm.

225
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,190
Could it be?

226
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,393
Trees have their own rhythm.

227
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,529
So does soil.

228
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,632
Is that what it is?

229
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,368
[TEACHER] This is an important
lesson for you to learn.

230
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,170
Zoro, there are
swordsmen out there

231
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,539
who are capable of
cutting nothing.

232
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,677
[ZORO] Does "cutting nothing"
mean hearing the rhythm

233
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,213
of the things around you?

234
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:12,551
If so, is that how
one can cut steel?

235
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,089
[MR. 1]
What the hell did you do?

236
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,225
After a vicious
attack like that,

237
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,994
and all the blood you've lost,

238
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,663
there's no way you
can still be alive!

239
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:32,704
[inaudible]

240
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,072
[ZORO]
I hear it.

241
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:38,577
His steel, it has a rhythm.

242
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,680
Just like everything
else around me.

243
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,424
[thud]

244
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,199
All right. Fine.

245
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,402
When I'm done, you're gonna
wish you'd stayed down.

246
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,739
[ZORO]
Only one question remains.

247
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,043
Do I really have the
ability to cut steel?

248
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,479
Well, there's only one
way to find out.

249
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,481
[MR. 1]
You failed with three swords.

250
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,618
Can you defend yourself
with only one?

251
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,424
I won't... defend.

252
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,127
So you're prepared... to die!

253
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:36,134

the next level.

[MR. 1]
I don't know how,

259
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,511
but he learned how to do it,
just like he said he would.

260
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:27,219
[MR. 1] Now that you've cut
steel, what's next for you?

261
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,820
Diamonds?

262
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:33,692
No, that'd be a waste.
