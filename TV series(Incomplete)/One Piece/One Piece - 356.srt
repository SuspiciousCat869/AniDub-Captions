1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,740
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,243
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,914
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:49,919
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,840
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,218
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,429
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,099
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,060
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,314
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,486
[LUFFY] We're gonna
make you regret you

48
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,864
even thought about
taking our food.

49
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,866
You hear me, Moria?!

50
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,950
We'll make him give back

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,204
twice the amount he took
from us, and before dawn!

52
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,955
[CREW] Yeah!

53
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,957
This is not good at all,

54
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,960
I gotta tell the master
before this gets serious.

55
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,217
What? Impossible!

56
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,886
No one wakes up that quickly
after their shadow's taken!

57
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,471
I... I didn't see it myself,

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,098
but their friends seem
to have beaten them awake.

59
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,269
We need Absalom!
What the hell is he doing?

60
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,314
[HILDON] Uh, well, um...

61
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,525
I'm pretty sure his wedding
ceremony just began,

62
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,027
and I'm also pretty sure that

63
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,821
all of the Zombie
Generals are attending.

64
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,407
Horo horo horo horo.

65
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,160
Just let the stupid
animal have his wedding.

66
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,328
[HOGBACK] What?

67
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,039
[PERONA] I'll be in my room
if you need anything else.

68
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,207
Come on, Kumacy.

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,000
[KUMACY] Right. Sorry.

70
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,419
Well I'm not bored
enough to bother standing.

71
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,256
I'll just wait here
for Oars to get back.

72
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,467
Well then, may I ask
a simple request?

73
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,514
Moria! Where the hell are you?

74
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,849
Oh, crap!

75
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,103
[LUFFY] Give us back our food!

76
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,229
[OARS] Huh?

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,200
Ah ah ah! I'm falling!

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,578
Usopp! Sanji!

79
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,416
[CHOPPER] Something
came crashing through.

80
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,042
They all fell down
with the stairs.

81
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,127
[ZORO] Their legs are twitching

82
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,005
so I'm sure they're fine,
nothing to worry about.

83
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,215
What I'm curious
about is this thing.

84
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,552
Well, whatever it is,
it's blocking our path.

85
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,305
Sure is a weird lookin' wall.

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,645
It's not made of rock.

87
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,275
What the hell
are you guys doing?

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,528
That thing's Luffy's zombie!

89
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,406
[FRANKY and ZORO]
What?!

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,164
[LUFFY] "Usopp's the Strongest?
Leave Anything Negative to Him."

91
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,262
Usopp and Sanji fell,

92
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,264
are you sure it's okay to
just leave them down there?

93
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,182
Don't worry about it,

94
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,933
those two can take
care of themselves.

95
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,602
And besides, if we're
gonna go after Moria,

96
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,811
we'd better hurry it up.

97
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,440
We gotta take that big onion
by surprise while we still can!

98
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,232
You said it!

99
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,275
The faster we beat him,

100
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,153
the faster we can get out
of this creepy place!

101
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,530
[CHOPPER] Up ahead is
that big dance hall place

102
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,616
where you lost your shadow.

103
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,326
If we keep going
forward after that,

104
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,036
we'll hit a giant refrigerator

105
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,662
that was the last
place we saw Moria.

106
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,414
Sounds good!

107
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,636
I thought
Perona was supposed

108
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,138
to take care of you miscreants!

109
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,432
Doctor Hogback!

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,645
Uh? A reindeer?
But why is it talking?

111
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,231
The infamous
Dr. Hogback, I presume.

112
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,152
[LUFFY] That guy was
hanging out with Moria.

113
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,571
Guess I'd better
kick his ass, too.

114
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,281
[HOGBACK] Let's not be hasty!

115
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,075
[CHOPPER] Don't do it, Luffy.

116
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,412
I have a bone to pick with
this guy, let me fight him.

117
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,997
You see that big,
metal door behind you?

118
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,336
[CHOPPER] That leads to
the refrigerator. Go on ahead.

119
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,798
Okay, you got it!

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,675
How rude, you can't
just ignore me

121
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,679
and waltz your way to Moria!
Get them, Cindry! No Mercy!

122
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:15,059
As you wish. One. Two.

123
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,769
[LUFFY] She's throwing plates?

124
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,481
Fasfas! Keep it up,
Cindry! Good!

125
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm not going
to miss this time.

126
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,364
Three.

127
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,493
Huh? What's that
coming out of you, Cindry?

128
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,039
It's you!

129
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,209
Go on ahead, Captain.

130
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,129
[LUFFY] You got it!
Thanks a lot, Robin!

131
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,465
[HOGBACK] I told you
to stop ignoring me!

132
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,050
Hey, Hogback!

133
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,224
You have no right to call
yourself a doctor anymore.

134
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,185
I've lost all respect for you.

135
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,229
Huh?
Fasfasfasfas!

136
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,232
I didn't recognize you
at first, Doctor Chopper!

137
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,068
So you're have zoan type
devil fruit powers, do you?

138
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,654
I must admit, you're
a fascinating creature.

139
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,239
I don't know how
you managed to escape

140
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,366
after they carried you
through Perona's garden,

141
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,618
but that's irrelevant now.

142
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,122
I've found you again and I won't
let you get away a second time.

143
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,416
Your shadow will be mine.

144
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,422
No, rather. I should have
that interesting body

145
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,091
of yours turned
into a marionette.

146
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,386
And I'll have your friends help!

147
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:42,271
[CHOPPER] That penguin. That's
the zombie with Sanji's shadow!

148
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,690
Then the one with
the sword must be.

149
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,286
Hey, wait a sec,

150
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,205
if you put someone's
shadow in a zombie,

151
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,456
they act like them right?

152
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,458
Then I think I've seen
your Zombie, Zoro.

153
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,293
Oh yeah? What
kinda guy was he?

154
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,464
Hmm... Well,
he looked just like you.

155
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,469
They say scars on the back
are the shame of a swordsman.

156
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,721
It's nothing like him at all!

157
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,681
You don't think?

158
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:21,310
Fasfas! Now, mop the
floor with their faces!

159
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,604
Of course,
Doctor Hogback.

160
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,943
So, which one is first?

161
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,779
The crappy reindeer.

162
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:54,218
[panting heavily]

163
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,262
Could this stupid
hallway be any longer?

164
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,888
Gimme a break!

165
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,146
All right, finally!
What is this place?

166
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,071
[LUFFY] There you are!

167
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,658
Oh, you again.

168
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,793
Uhh... Ahh... Gah...

169
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,095
This thing is too
frickin' huge, brother!

170
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:42,975
[FRANKY]
And look at those horns!

171
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,977
Did he climb up
from hell or something?

172
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,730
I've never seen
anything like this!

173
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,942
It's really a zombie?

174
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,820
Holy crap.

175
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,113
Luffy.

176
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,239
It's all over!

177
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:02,161
He's gonna grind us up
and make meat pies out of us!

178
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,061
[USSOP screams in panic]

179
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,901
What is he gonna do?

180
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,744
IYAAAAAAAA!!!

181
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:04,056
Ahhh. There we go.

182
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,060
[USOPP] Huh?

183
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,940
Okay, now I look
like the real thing!

184
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,778
Can't be the King of the
Pirates without an awesome hat.

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,158
Man,that sure was scary
when that building fell down.

186
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,201
What just happened?

187
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,747
Are you telling me that
thing didn't even notice us?

188
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,748
It's hard to believe,

189
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,250
but it really does act
like Luffy, doesn't it?

190
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,251
Something that huge

191
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,171
with his fighting power
is gonna give us hell.

192
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,136
'Cmon, let's just
get out of here.

193
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,722
You guys don't need
your shadows, right?

194
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,806
Like hell we don't!

195
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,349
Even if I did give
up on my shadow,

196
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,352
which is stupid, by the way,
we'd still have to rescue Nami,

197
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,646
so get your ass up!

198
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,074
[SANJI] The problem right now is
that we're all stuck down here.

199
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,910
The stairs were the
only sure fire way to get

200
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,370
where we're going and
they're completely destroyed.

201
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,373
And even if we changed our
route and take this passage.

202
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,418
We're still screwed, since
the bridge got taken out too.

203
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,586
In other words,

204
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,130
we can't get to that mansion
with the mast either way.

205
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,424
[ZORO] And it's way
too far for us to jump.

206
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,384
[USOPP] We had a
shortcut laid out for us,

207
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,846
now we're gonna have to go
some scary way full of zombies.

208
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,724
[FRANKY] Just gimme
30 seconds, I got this.

209
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,357
[FRANKY] I'm not happy with
how this railing turned out.

210
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,362
You built a bridge?

211
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,245
There was wood and
scraps everywhere.

212
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,080
If I couldn't throw
together a bridge or two,

213
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,873
I'd be a damn disgrace.

214
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,875
I mean, if you say so,
but for a makeshift bridge,

215
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,169
you sure put a lot of
effort into the details.

216
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,004
You sayin' you want me

217
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,214
to do a half assed
construction job? Huh?

218
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,758
Nah. Don't hear
me complaining.

219
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,052
Anyway, thanks a lot. Let's go.

220
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,745
What, does a
princess live here?

221
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,249
Dunno what I was
expecting, but it wasn't this.

222
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,750
What the...?

223
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,338
Horo horo horo horo!

224
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,430
[PERONA] I was going to
have my zombies grab you

225
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,931
at the stairs by the bridge,

226
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,893
but I suppose that
plan fell through.

227
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,229
[PERONA] Oars was just reborn
and he's already a nuisance.

228
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,693
My patience is running
very thin tonight.

229
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,387
[ZORO] It's those ghosts again.

230
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,641
So it was her controlling
them all this time?

231
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,727
What the hell are
those things, anyway?

232
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,358
Horo horo horo horo!

233
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, my. Is that fear
I sense in your voice?

234
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,446
I wouldn't blame you after
what happened last time.

235
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,833
[PERONA] I can create
ghosts at my command

236
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,294
with the power of the
Hollow-Hollow Fruit.

237
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,547
You can think of them as a
sort of extension of myself.

238
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,217
They can empty your heart
and crush your spirit.

239
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,886
Horo horo horo horo!

240
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,348
This should be fun,
for me at least.

241
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,683
I can't believe
this little cutie

242
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,644
is the one making those
annoying ghost creatures!

243
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,354
Save your comments
for another time--

244
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,855
if we get hit by even
one of those things,

245
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,691
it's all over for us!

246
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,651
He's right, we gotta run!

247
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,362
I don't wanna
lose my dignity again.

248
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,825
[FRANKY] Retreat!

249
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,535
Negative Hollow!

250
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,371
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo!

251
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:01,895
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo!

252
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:05,733
[SANJI] I'm dumber than a
mackerel. I should just die.

253
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:12,239
[FRANKY] I know, bro. I wish
a stray dog would step on me!

254
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,574
[ZORO]
I should just crawl around

255
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,785
on the ground like
a worm, and eat dirt!

256
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,706
[USOPP]
It's all over.

257
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,752
[FRANKY sobs]

258
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,386
Capture them.

259
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,604
Well, that was easy.

260
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,356
All that's left are
the three above us.

261
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,612
[USOPP] Gatling Salt Star!

262
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,958
Who did that?

263
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,344
That's my crew, you know.

264
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,513
I won't let you hurt them!

265
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,181
Tricky punk.

266
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,017
You acted like you got hit
just so you could surprise me!

267
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,941
But don't worry,
I won't miss a second time.

268
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,408
Negative Hollow!

269
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,803
What?

270
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,892
[USOPP] My name...
is Captain Usopp.

271
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,852
[PERONA] I don't get it!

272
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,854
Why don't my attacks
do anything to you?

273
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,691
I know I didn't miss
that time! What is this?

274
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,818
What kind of power have you got?

275
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,028
Power has nothing to do with it.

276
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:21,952
I just naturally have
a negative personality!

277
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:27,082
What?

278
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,551
He's even more negative

279
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,386
than the Negative ghosts!

280
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,721
He's a real piece of work!

281
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,515
No, Mistress Perona!

282
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,731
[PERONA thinking]
It can't be!

283
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,525
No human is immune
to the Negative Hollows!

284
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,987
They have the power
to empty your heart!

285
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,906
Perona!

286
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,118
[PERONA thinking]
So long as humans are alive.

287
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,579
They're always
looking toward the future,

288
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,499
moving forward
one step at a time.

289
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,044
But this man, he...

290
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,925
[USOPP] Huh?

291
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,764
Don't give up.

292
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,935
Don't give up!

293
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,437
Don't give up!!

294
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,481
[WILD ZOMBIES]
Don't give up!

295
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,943
Don't give up! Do your best!
Don't give up! Do your best!

296
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,153
Don't pity me!

297
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,617
Come on you guys,
time to snap outta this!

298
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,494
You gotta go rescue Nami
and get the shadows back

299
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,120
before it's too late!

300
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,502
[USOPP] No matter
how strong you are,

301
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,087
you don't stand a
chance against her.

302
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,881
All you can do is run.
But don't worry.

303
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,967
I'll take care of her for you!

304
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,552
I can't believe it.

305
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,222
Usopp actually
looks cool for once.

306
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,849
Is his heart
really that empty?

307
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,020
Little turd!

308
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,813
[USOPP]
Oh, but please defeat

309
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,648
all of the zombies
before you go.

310
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,818
Valiant though I may be,
I must conserve my energy for...

311
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,860
[SANJI] All right, see ya later!

312
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,820
[USOPP] Hey, wait! No, uh...

313
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,947
The zombies.
You gotta beat the zombies.

314
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,867
I can't do that
part on my own! Wait!

315
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,876
That's fine. I'll just
pound you to death.

316
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,058
[ZOMBIE PRIEST] Do you, Absalom,
promise to take Nami,

317
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,019
as your lawfully wedded wife,

318
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,022
to have and to hold
in good times and in bad,

319
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,524
in sickness and in health?

320
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,651
Damn straight.

321
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,863
[cheering]

322
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,157
[ZOMBIE PRIEST] Do you,
Nami, promise to take Absalom

323
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:09,328
as your husband, to have and to
hold, in good times and in bad,

324
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,996
in sickness and in health?

325
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,082
[ZOMBIE 356A] Oh, yes I sure do!

326
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,335
I think he's so cute!

327
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:21,006
[cheering]

328
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,300
Then you may now
kiss the bride.

329
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,273
[OARS] Hey, what's this thing?

330
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,359
Whoa, when I pull it,
the boat moves!

331
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,946
That's pretty cool.
Which way is right again?

332
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,198
Ah, I forgot. Oh well.

333
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,412
Just tell me where the meat is!
Set sail for meat!

334
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,913
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

335
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,290
"The General Zombies
are Down in a Flash!

336
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,376
Oars Feels like an Adventure!"

337
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,795
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
