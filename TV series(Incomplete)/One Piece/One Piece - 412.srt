1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,491
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,127
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,430
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,367
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,201
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,136
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,738
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,674
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,544
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,212
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,713
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,850
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,654
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,857
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,927
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,665
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,804
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,806
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,741
After soaring through
the sky for hours,

56
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,245
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women,

57
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,380
Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,382
[NARRATOR] After a
scuffle with the Kuja tribe,

59
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,652
Luffy escaped, only to
return in search of a boat.

60
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,821
[gong ringing]

61
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,356
[ENISHIDA]
Your attention please!

62
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,459
The Snake Princess
will now bathe!

63
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,564
[LUFFY] This is... a huge bath!

64
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,339
A man?

65
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,340
Hey...

66
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,242
That thing on your back.

67
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,981
It looks...

68
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,550
...kinda familiar.

69
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,918
You saw it?

70
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,656
[LUFFY]
Heartless Judgment!

71
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,891
Margaret is Turned to Stone!

72
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,330
What's the matter?

73
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,832
I heard a loud crash!

74
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,800
Are you okay? What happened?

75
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,704
Am I seeing things, or...

76
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,839
...is that a man?

77
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,441
What is a man
doing on our island?

78
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,818
Shroud yourself
from his leering gaze.

79
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,687
Huh? No!

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,490
My secret is out.
He saw my back.

81
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,262
Then we mustn't let him
leave the castle alive.

82
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,196
Why not?

83
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,399
What's the big deal?
I just saw her back.

84
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,035
But y'know, it's kinda weird.

85
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,570
I coulda sworn I've
seen that somewhere before.

86
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,006
What you saw is a secret
we would die to protect.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,042
Or rather, one that
we would kill to protect,

88
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,843
in this particular instance.

89
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,512
Secret? That thing?

90
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,746
Why's it a secret?

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,881
Who are you?

92
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,350
[HANCOCK] Take those questions
to the grave with you.

93
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,585
Love-Love Beam!

94
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,920
Hold on. What?

95
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,723
It's a Slow-Slow Beam!

96
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,730
No! It's making...

97
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,933
...me slow!

98
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,848
Love-Love Beam!

99
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,953
[LUFFY yelling]

100
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,733
Why won't he
transform into stone?

101
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,701
Don't tell me he doesn't
feel any excitement

102
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,002
after seeing me in the bath!

103
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,504
I am without flaw!

104
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,873
But that's simply beyond
the realm of possibility!

105
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,042
The sublime grandeur
of your nude form

106
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,411
can irreparably
beguile any creature!

107
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,446
His fear of death
must be overwhelming

108
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,048
the impure urges within him.

109
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,484
He's a pitiful coward,
but he's a lucky one!

110
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,719
[LUFFY] You keep
talkin' 'bout dying, so bye!

111
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,622
I was just looking for
someone important to talk to!

112
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,024
From this high up?

113
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,527
He's out of his mind!

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,062
I've got him.

115
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,730
Now Pistol Kiss!

116
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,571
What the...
They didn't bounce off me.

117
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,640
What kind of bullets were those?

118
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,011
That man is a
dangerous intruder!

119
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,747
Kuja Pirates!
Go forth and capture him!

120
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,048
Uh... Yes, ma'am!

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,718
A man?
How did a man even get here?

122
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,521
Who cares? Let's just
go and catch the bastard!

123
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,555
Right.

124
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,725
[coughing]

125
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,393
That hurt!

126
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,064
[RAN] If you want to live,
you'll do as we say.

127
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,266
[DAISY] Of course he will, Ran.

128
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,903
No man alive is stupid enough
to defy the Kuja Warriors.

129
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,671
He's pretty scrawny, anyway.

130
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,406
[giggling]

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,707
It is a man.

132
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,709
A real live man in our village?

133
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,777
I've got a hunch you guys

134
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,146
are the all-woman
pirate group I've heard about.

135
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,682
I'm lookin' for your boss.
Where is she?

136
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,084
Why do you want to know that
and why should I tell you?

137
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,454
Well, your boss has
got her own ship, right?

138
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,288
If I find her,

139
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,756
I was hoping she
might be nice enough

140
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,958
to give me a ride
to go see all my friends.

141
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,526
That's just ridiculous.

142
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,562
All men are forbidden
in Amazon Lily,

143
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,497
which makes you a trespasser.

144
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,799
Clearly, she won't
let you leave here alive!

145
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,900
Men sure are dumb.

146
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,035
[giggling]

147
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,472
I can't let myself go
and get caught again!

148
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,641
Now Gum-Gum...

149
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,476
[RAN] Seize him!

150
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,777
...Rocket!

151
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,747
[AMAZON 412A]
What the...

152
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,216
After him, quickly!

153
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,051
You heard the
Snake Princess' orders!

154
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,420
He can't escape, no matter what!

155
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,456
[AMAZON 412C] There's a mannnn!

156
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,926
[AMAZON 412C]
There's a man on the island!

157
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,094
[AMAZON 412D] A man?

158
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,497
The Kuja Pirates are trying
to capture him right now.

159
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,232
We should pitch in
and help them out, too!

160
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,033
[AMAZON 412E]
You're right! Let's go!

161
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,207
She's already put
our land in peril.

162
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,210
But to allow a man onto
the island at a time like this

163
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,845
smacks of insolence.

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,247
I've tried to hold my tongue,

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,216
but frankly, I'm starting
to worry about our future

166
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,085
with her in charge.

167
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,889
[RAN] Don't let him get away!

168
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,259
[MARGARET]
The Kuja Pirates are back!

169
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,226
And from the look of things,

170
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,562
the man has returned
to the village as well.

171
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,732
[APHELANDRA]
There he is! Up there!

172
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,434
[LUFFY] Darn.

173
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,204
I really thought she'd be
in the tallest building here.

174
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,073
Let's see, if I was
important, where would I go?

175
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,912
How did they find me so fast?

176
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,246
I jumped the whole village!

177
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,281
We'd better
hurry up and kill him

178
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,983
before the Snake Princess
can interrogate him.

179
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,222
Those girls
really wanna shoot me.

180
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,525
[MARGARET] He fell!

181
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,598
There he is! Behind us!

182
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,866
[LUFFY] Aw, crap!

183
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,201
[RAN] Halt!

184
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,250
[chuckling]

185
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,892
[NYON] Nyot so fast!

186
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,766
[NYON] A pirate worth
300 million Berries.

187
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,569
But what is he doing
in Amazon Lily?

188
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,103
[RAN] I found him!

189
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,304
Sorry, I gotta run!

190
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,073
Thanks for the grub, though!

191
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,940
Hold on!

192
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,242
Let me have one
last look at your face!

193
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,145
[NYON] I said hold on!

194
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,788
This place is freaking nuts.

195
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,857
Even the old ladies are strong.

196
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,759
[RAN]
Ha! We've got you cornered.

197
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,200
We're too late.
The Kuja Pirates captured him.

198
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,267
There's nothing we can do.

199
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,070
I fear we must prepare
for the worst, my sisters.

200
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,778
[NYON]
There's nyo doubt about it.

201
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,747
It really is him.

202
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,904
[AMAZONS praising]

203
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,711
[LUFFY] Get offa me,
you stupid snakes!

204
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,580
What kind of snakes are these?

205
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,015
They feel like
they're made of iron!

206
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,750
It seems luck is against us.

207
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:09,685
Let's just hope they
skip the interrogation

208
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,187
and kill him right away.

209
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,189
But they'll kill him
no matter what.

210
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,790
Won't they?

211
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,058
What's with this country?

212
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,193
They weren't joking
when they said

213
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,261
there aren't
any men around here.

214
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:29,538
[AMAZONS praising]

215
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:34,810
[AMAZONS praising]

216
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,912
I'm ready for
my explanation now.

217
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,013
Specifically,
I would like to know

218
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:41,217
how you got onto this island
and what you want here.

219
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,619
I don't know!
I'm just as confused as you!

220
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:45,688
I got sent
flying through the sky,

221
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,857
and the next thing
I knew, I landed here!

222
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,125
An unlikely story.

223
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,760
Lying to me
will only guarantee you

224
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,928
an excruciatingly painful death.

225
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,997
You're here
because you want something.

226
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,066
Well, yeah,
I could really use a ship.

227
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,834
Actually, it'd be
better if you guys

228
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,836
could just give
me a lift, though.

229
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,338
Either way,
I'm in a pretty big hurry

230
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,173
and I need to
get going right away.

231
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:06,308
You are the boss
around here, right, lady?

232
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,309
So help me out!

233
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,945
Who does this
disrespectful punk think he is?

234
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
The Snake Princess is right!

235
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:14,850
That story is clearly
an implausible fabrication!

236
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,986
Don't listen to him,
he's plotting something!

237
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,888
You can't deceive us!

238
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,927
Anyway, guess I should pay
you back for all your help.

239
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,130
If there's anything
I can do for you, just ask.

240
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,300
I can't rest 'til I know
my friends survived like I did.

241
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,935
That's all that matters.

242
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,771
'Cause as long as they're alive,

243
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,174
we can get back up
and keep fighting!

244
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:48,250
[AMAZONS chattering angrily]

245
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,222
[AMAZONS chattering angrily]

246
00:12:57,126 --> 00:13:00,196
The only way that you will
leave this island is by dying.

247
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,698
And your departure is imminent.

248
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:11,140
Please, Snake Princess,
he's not lying!

249
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,308
[AMAZONS gasp]

250
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,384
I know how this must sound,

251
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,753
but I don't believe this man
is the kind of person

252
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,155
who can tell a lie!

253
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,857
--What is she doing?
--What is she doing?

254
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,902
Please, Snake Princess.

255
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,074
I believe he's
telling the truth.

256
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,476
This man is
incapable of anything

257
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,444
but a childlike sincerity.

258
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,046
I honestly don't
think he would ever

259
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,049
try to inflict
any harm upon our land.

260
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,851
Hey, thanks, buddy!

261
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:30,886
I knew you didn't
really wanna kill me!

262
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,922
You're one of our
warriors, aren't you?

263
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,423
[MARGARET]
Yes, my name is Margaret.

264
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,958
Given that men
are forbidden here

265
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,092
under penalty of death,

266
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,429
he sealed his fate the
moment he arrived in our land.

267
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,498
Why defend him?

268
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:45,501
Because I share
the burden of guilt.

269
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:46,902
The person who brought him here

270
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,904
and who allowed him
into the city...

271
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:53,776
It was me!

272
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,077
[AMAZONS gasp]

273
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,513
Margaret, no! You can't!

274
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,789
Snake Princess!

275
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,258
Please still your fury.
It was not her fault!

276
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,159
It's true!

277
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,927
We found him
knocked out in the forest

278
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,495
totally covered in mushrooms!

279
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:16,498
We thought he was one of us
so we brought him back here!

280
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,500
[MARGARET]
Sweetpea! Aphelandra!

281
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,102
We're just as
guilty as Margaret,

282
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,538
but under all those mushrooms,
we just couldn't tell!

283
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:24,173
It was an
honest mistake, Empress!

284
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,841
Stop it!
I won't let you do this!

285
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,109
I'm the one who
said we should bring him

286
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,944
back to the village, not you!

287
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,546
Does she realize
what she's doing?

288
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,880
She's trying to be honest,

289
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,415
but she's
just being stupid.

290
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,284
[laughing]

291
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,853
You guys are all right!

292
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,188
You were trying
to kill me back there,

293
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:41,790
but now I see you're
actually pretty nice!

294
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,907
I bear the sole responsibility

295
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,442
for bringing
the man here, Empress!

296
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,177
--Please, Margaret!
--Please, Margaret!

297
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,148
[HANCOCK] It's all right.

298
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,318
[HANCOCK] Now lift your head,
honest little Margaret.

299
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,425
I have a soft spot for
hopelessly sincere people.

300
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,226
Now tell me, Margaret.

301
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,229
Do you wish for my forgiveness?

302
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,165
I... I do.

303
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,069
You may rise to your feet.

304
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,525
Well, that's the
Snake Princess for you.

305
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,260
Not only is she beautiful,

306
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,162
she's also
filled with compassion.

307
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:30,549
We love you, Snake Princess!

308
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:37,564
Love-Love Beam!

309
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,405
Huh? What the...

310
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,347
Why didn't you keep quiet?

311
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,215
Hold on! What happened?

312
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,017
What's wrong with you guys?

313
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,888
[LUFFY]
They turned to stone! Why?

314
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:05,426
[LUFFY] Hey...

315
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,063
[LUFFY] Hey!

316
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,401
[LUFFY] Hey, you!

317
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,336
What the hell did you do?

318
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,006
These three
saved my life, you know!

319
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,907
[HANCOCK] Precisely.

320
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,642
And now they have
been justly punished

321
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,243
for their transgression.

322
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,979
Then it's my fault.

323
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,449
[LUFFY] Wait!
Turn them back to normal now!

324
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,616
[HANCOCK] How amusing!

325
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,085
You think you can
give me orders, do you?

326
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,021
Turn them back, dammit!

327
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,526
I believe it's
time to release Bakula.

328
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,627
Bakula?

329
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,263
The man's already dead
and he doesn't even know it!

330
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,965
I told you to turn them back!

331
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,068
This is the female
warrior nation of Amazon Lily.

332
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,671
Here, strength is
regarded as true beauty.

333
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,507
Show us what little
strength you may possess,

334
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,310
and be grateful that I've
given you death in battle.

335
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:05,018
[HANCOCK] Behind you stands
the panther known as Bakula.

336
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:07,421
The beast has served
as the official executioner

337
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:10,290
of Amazon Lily
for generations now.

338
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:11,425
[HANCOCK] When it's done,

339
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,661
there won't be a single
bone left to remember you by.

340
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:19,366
Oh, my,
our furry friend seems

341
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:21,401
to be rather famished today.

342
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,205
Indeed, we're in luck.

343
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:29,510
It so happens that Bakula
hasn't been fed in several days.

344
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,144
You should be happy, man.

345
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:34,214
Bakula normally tortures
and toys with its prey first.

346
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,583
But he'll eat you
in a single bite today.

347
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,519
I don't care about your cat.

348
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,122
All I care about is them!

349
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:43,690
Turn them back, now!

350
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,992
Do you hear how that savage

351
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,660
is speaking to
the Snake Princess?

352
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,695
Tear him limb
from limb, Bakula!

353
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,003
Now, Bakula!

354
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:58,171
[AMAZONS] Eat him!

355
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:50,157
He's strong.

356
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,026
He just knocked Bakula out
with a single blow!

357
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,663
And he didn't
even use any Haki.

358
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,066
Then... that was
just brute strength?

359
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,301
What the hell
is wrong with all of you?!

360
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,671
That woman up there.

361
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,609
She turned three of
your own people into stone!

362
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,411
How can you just sit up
there and laugh like that?

363
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:12,679
[AMAZON]
I never!

364
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:16,116
That little savage has
the gall to shout at us!

365
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,552
Don't listen to him!
He's just an animal!

366
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,220
Sure, I feel
sorry for those three.

367
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,290
But the Snake Princess had
every right to do what she did!

368
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,191
[AMAZON 412C] Of course!

369
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:25,292
It was justice!

370
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,095
They violated
the law of our land!

371
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,397
What you don't understand...

372
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,166
...is that I'll be
forgiven for anything I do.

373
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,669
Absolutely anything.

374
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:37,237
And the reason why...

375
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,439
...is because I'm beautiful.

376
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:49,249
[screaming]

377
00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:50,450
Just look at me.

378
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,519
I'm sure you must agree.

379
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:54,421
Actually, you make me sick.

380
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,592
[MARIGOLD] Stay strong, sister!

381
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,794
This simply cannot be happening.

382
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:03,230
There's no man alive
that can resist my allure!

383
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:05,198
It's just not possible!

384
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,638
So long as that man
exists in this world,

385
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,407
I shall never know peace again!

386
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,876
How dare you hurt
the Snake Princess like that!

387
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,878
Make the man
suffer for his crimes!

388
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,680
Execute him!

389
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,350
[AMAZONS] Execute! Execute!

390
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,719
[HANCOCK]
Marigold! Sandersonia!

391
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,388
Defend my honor
and take his head!

392
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:32,225
[AMAZONS] Execute! Execute!

393
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:35,128
You got it. We'll get
the job done, big sis.

394
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,176
So these girls
have powers, too.

395
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:56,383
[AMAZONS] Execute! Execute!
Execute! Execute!

396
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:01,455
[chanting continues]

397
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,435
[NARRATOR] When Empress
Hancock orders her sisters

398
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,703
to execute Luffy,

399
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,739
they transform
into fearsome serpents

400
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,407
and begin a deadly assault.

401
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,642
Luffy fights for his life,
but soon discovers

402
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:25,245
that the two women
have a mysterious ability

403
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,781
that allows them to slither
through all of his attacks

404
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,282
unharmed.

405
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,517
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

406
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,588
A Difficult Fight for Luffy!
The Snake Sisters' Haki Power!

407
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,157
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
