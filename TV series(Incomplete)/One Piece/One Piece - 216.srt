1
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,385
[NARRATOR] The Foxy
Pirates requested a rematch

2
00:01:58,418 --> 00:01:59,587
of the Davy Back Fight,

3
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,822
and Luffy and his
crew have accepted.

4
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,357
Despite putting
up a good fight,

5
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,027
the last event left
Luffy alone in defeat.

6
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,177
Straw Hat Luffy! You're out!

7
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,277
What?!

8
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,715
[ITOMIMIZU] It's over!
Straw Hat Luffy has eaten

9
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,684
his way to defeat as
Team Foxy claims victory

10
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,019
in the first round!

11
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,231
[ITOMIMIZU] The Foxy Pirates
have claimed the victory

12
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,334
for Round 1 in the rematch
of the Davy Back Fight.

13
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,536
It's time for the Boss
to claim his prize.

14
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,606
Which member of the
Straw Hat Crew will he choose?

15
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,309
Feh-feh-feh!
The one I want is...

16
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,212
Oh, it's so obvious!
Isn't it, Boss?

17
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,515
Feh-feh-feh!
Feh-feh-feh!

18
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,418
You! The archaeologist,
Nico Robin!

19
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,420
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
Huh?

20
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,254
You want me?

21
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,756
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh!
The boss has decided

22
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,292
that his pick for this
round is Nico Robin!

23
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,361
Oh, Captain! You're
such a naughty boy!

24
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,462
Why, Boss?

25
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,332
Why didn't you get my
adorable little Choppy back?

26
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,667
We can't afford
to leave that woman

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,169
on the Straw Hat's team.
She's far too dangerous!

28
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,071
Bringing her to our side
will give us the advantage

29
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,406
from here on out.

30
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,273
[PORCHE]
But...

31
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,242
[FOXY] This way,
taking Dr. Chopper back

32
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,644
in the next round
will be a piece of cake!

33
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,080
[PORCHE] Now I get it!
You're so smart, Boss!

34
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,748
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

35
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,083
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
Robin!

36
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,718
[SANJI]
Robin, my love!

37
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,386
See you later!

38
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,823
I feel her pain!

39
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:46,327
She's trying to hide her sorrow
behind that beautiful smile!

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,195
She hates being
apart from me!

41
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,397
How dare they take
my sweet Robin away!

42
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,833
Even if it is the rules,
do they know nothing of love?!

43
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,167
Robin!

44
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,735
Robin!

45
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,139
So, how does it look?

46
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,474
Splendid! Perfect!

47
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,276
It complements
that beautiful hair!

48
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,545
You were the one we
wanted from the beginning!

49
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,080
She's so popular!

50
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,715
Feh-feh-feh!

51
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,316
[USOPP]
She uh...

52
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,152
She seems to be getting
along with them pretty well.

53
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,688
It figures. I never trusted
that woman to begin with.

54
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,856
What are you talking about?!

55
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,760
Robin trusts us to get her
back that's all! I think...

56
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,162
As always, Nami's
right on the money.

57
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,131
I'm gonna give it everything
I've got in the next round

58
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,233
and help win
Robin back for us.

59
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,068
Let's get this next round going!

60
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,002
Lemme at 'em!

61
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,138
Luffy, you can't
compete in the next round.

62
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,107
You're in the third
round, remember?

63
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,309
Geez, just remember
the rules already.

64
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,578
All right. Guess I'm
on cheering duty then.

65
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,645
With Robin gone,

66
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,081
that means there're only
5 of us in the next event.

67
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,616
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

68
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,251
[FOXY thinking]
Stupid Straw Hats!

69
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,153
You've lost more than
a member of your crew.

70
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,255
You've lost a major
part of your offense!

71
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,125
How do you like
them grapes?! Er... Apples!

72
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,160
Whatever...
On to the next event!

73
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,495
Feh-feh-feh!

74
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,369
[ITOMIMIZU] Round 2 will
be held on the Long Reef.

75
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,707
The game will be Dash Touch
Domination or "DTD" for short.

76
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,209
Although this is a
six-on-six group competition,

77
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,679
the absence of Nico Robin
forces the Straw Hats

78
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,248
to compete with
only 5 players.

79
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,449
The rules are simple.

80
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,084
Basically, it's
played the same way

81
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,686
as the game
"Red Light, Green Light."

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,721
Whoever moves, even just
the tiniest little bit,

83
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,823
after the "light"
stops calling is out!

84
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,426
Whichever team touches
the "stop light" at the top

85
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,595
of the reef first will
be declared the winner!

86
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,330
But this is no kids's game!

87
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,599
Remember, when pirates play
"Red Light, Green Light,"

88
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,701
they play hard
and they play to win!

89
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,237
The use of weapons is
approved and encouraged.

90
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,374
This is what makes
DTD a truly perilous game!

91
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,409
Playing for the
Straw Hat team is

92
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,111
the same boring
lineup as always.

93
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,512
Shut it, jerk!

94
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,713
Leading off for Team Foxy

95
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,618
is our beloved idol Porche
and the beastly oddity Hamburg!

96
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,153
Soon I will have little
Choppy right back in my hands!

97
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,488
Puh-puh-puh!

98
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,756
[ITOMIMIZU]
The rest of the team

99
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,825
consists of the
ever-swift Chiqicheetah,

100
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,227
the fishman Capote, and
back for some vengeance

101
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,361
for their loss in
the Groggy Ring,

102
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:05,666
we have Tackle Machine Pickles
and Big Pan the Wotan!

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,668
We're gonna make those
Straw Hat losers pay

104
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,203
for humiliating us!

105
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,438
[chuckles]

106
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,707
[ITOMIMIZU] These six
competitors will make Team Foxy

107
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,410
a force to be reckoned with!

108
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:20,114
Hey, why is the old stilts guy
up there riding around with him?

109
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,315
And last, but not least,

110
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,083
the role of our
"stop light" will be played

111
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,619
by none other than the
nomad himself, Tonjit!

112
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,489
This great fool--I mean man
of bravery stood atop stilts

113
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,324
for ten years that
touched the heavens.

114
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,592
This makes him
the logical choice

115
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,495
to stand at the top
of the reef and be it.

116
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,197
I'm seriously sick and
tired of high places, though.

117
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,332
[USOPP]
Hey, wait a minute!

118
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,833
If the old man is
the "stop light,"

119
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,303
that gives us a big
advantage in the DTD!

120
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:44,572
[SANJI] Let's not get
ahead of ourselves here.

121
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:45,639
But Usopp's right, you guys!

122
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:48,475
This could be just the
lucky break that we need!

123
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,112
You sure about
all this, Captain?

124
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,480
Come on! This is nothing!

125
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,414
If our crew is strong enough

126
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,216
to battle the treacherous
wide open sea,

127
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,318
then this is child's play!

128
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,185
Don't sweat the small stuff!

129
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,255
[FOXY PIRATE E]
You said it, Boss!

130
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,090
[FOXY PIRATE F] Yeah!
Our Captain's the greatest!

131
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,359
"Child's play" huh?

132
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,127
Then why did you
give us this unfair,

133
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,497
jacked-up course giving you
the advantage from the start!

134
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,471
[SANJI] I guess using that Do-Do
Beam really is his only talent.

135
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,539
[CHOPPER]
Stupid Fox.

136
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,639
[USOPP]
Split Head.

137
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,445
Do-Do Beam?! And a
"Stupid Fox"?! A "Split Head"?!

138
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,312
[FOXY PIRATE D]
Boss, no!

139
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,580
[FOXY PIRATE G]
Don't listen to them!

140
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,350
You certainly wear your heart
on your sleeve, Captain Foxy.

141
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,186
[ITAOMIMIZU] To kick off this
event, as the DTD rules state,

142
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,222
both teams must start by
calling out the first step!

143
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,492
[COMPETITORS]
Taking the first step... now!

144
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,493
So it begins!

145
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:42,263
And Team Foxy is already
off to an early lead!

146
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,265
It's because of
those huge freaks.

147
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,369
If we follow the boss's plan
this'll be easy! Let's do it!

148
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,203
Yeah!

149
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,104
I'm sure this
goes without saying

150
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,273
but there's more to
winning this thing

151
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,575
than just being the first
one to touch the stop light.

152
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,777
This twisted terrain makes
it easy to lose your balance

153
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,045
when coming to a sudden stop,

154
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,548
so that'll be the most likely
time for the enemy to attack.

155
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,382
Hey, Split-Head!

156
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,118
If you screw around
with this race,

157
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,053
I'm gonna have
something to say about it!

158
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,523
Split-Head?! Ha! Like
I'd even need to interfere!

159
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,259
We could win this race
in our sleep, Straw Hat!

160
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,461
"Stop Light"!
Are you ready to begin?

161
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,663
[TONJIT]
Uh-huh!

162
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,163
[ITOMIMIZU]
Then take your position!

163
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,400
[CROWD cheers]

164
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,667
Yeah!

165
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,236
To recap,

166
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,506
Team Foxy claimed the
victory in the last round.

167
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:31,512
Let's see what happens in
Round 2: DTD! Ready? Go!

168
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,180
[TONJIT]
Green.

169
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,786
Run! Quick, Hamburg!

170
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,020
Puh!

171
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:42,222
[ITOMIMIZU] Chiqicheetah sprints
ahead to take an early lead,

172
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,191
with "Full Dash"
Hamburg following behind

173
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,593
in second place.

174
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,194
Meanwhile, on the
Straw Hat's side,

175
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,663
Zoro and Sanji are out in front,
running neck and neck.

176
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,831
[ZORO]
Move! You're in the way!

177
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,067
[SANJI]
No, you move! You're in my way!

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,302
How can those two idiots run
and argue at the same time?!

179
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,338
[NAMI]
Hey! Knock it off, you two!

180
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,372
[USOPP]
Yeah! Concentrate on the game!

181
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,810
[CHOPPER]
They're amazing!

182
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,646
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!

183
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,581
Whoa!
What the heck?

184
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,782
How can you hold that word out

185
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,318
for so long,
freaky old stilts guy?

186
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,653
He makes an ideal "stop light."

187
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:16,657
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...!

188
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,825
[ZORO]
Lovey-dovey loser!

189
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,793
[SANJI] What was that,
fish-flake head?!

190
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,294
[ZORO]
You heard me!

191
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,163
The only ones to worry about

192
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,232
from the Straw Hat
team are those two.

193
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,401
Let's knock 'em outta the game
quick, just like we planned!

194
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:35,041
Big Pan! Go!

195
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,278
Punk Attack!

196
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,315
Oh, crap! It's headed
right for them!

197
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,317
And the old man's about
to finish his "red light"!

198
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,185
We don't have time
to worry about that!

199
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,321
[TONJIT]
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig--

200
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,792
[chuckles]

201
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,665
[TONJIT]
--iiiiiiight!

202
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,266
Quick! Stop!

203
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,715
[thinking]
If we move, we'll be out!

204
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,791
[TONJIT]
You're out!

205
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,693
[ITOMIMIZU] An early
upset on Team Foxy

206
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,328
for Pickles and Big Pan!

207
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,630
They've been knocked off the
course and out of the game!

208
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,399
All right, Zoro and Sanji!
Way to go! Nice one!

209
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,034
Whatever! It's no big deal!

210
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,736
We only need one
person on Team Foxy

211
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,803
to touch him for the win,

212
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,340
and it doesn't matter
which one of them does it.

213
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,408
Feh-feh-feh!

214
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,143
[ITOMIMIZU] Chiqicheetah,
Porche, and Hamburg

215
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,311
are out in front

216
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,114
and have quite a significant
lead over the Straw Hats!

217
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,215
Oh, my!

218
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,184
That put me in a "we're
totally going to win" mood!

219
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,052
Puh-puh-puh!

220
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,787
Damn! They're way too fast!

221
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,590
It looks like Zoro and
Sanji are our only hope.

222
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,492
Stupid Moss Head sword swinger.

223
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,494
Delusional Love Cook!

224
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,463
I'm warning you, I'm on
a very important mission

225
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,064
to rescue my sweet Robin.

226
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,799
If you do anything
to get in the way...

227
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,733
[TONJIT]
Greeeeeeeeeeeeeee--

228
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,701
I don't have time
to listen to this crap!

229
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:12,105
Hey! Hold on!
I wasn't finished, you jerk!

230
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,576
[ITOMIMIZU] Despite
losing two players,

231
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,444
Team Foxy
has a huge lead

232
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,546
and is the closest to
reaching the "stop light."

233
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,748
At this rate, the Straw Hats

234
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,550
don't stand a chance
of winning this round!

235
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,453
[CROWD cheers]

236
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,088
Go! Go!

237
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,623
That's it! Yes, just like that!

238
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,425
Keep it up, and we'll win!
Feh-feh-feh!

239
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,211
[TONJIT]
...eeeeee...

240
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,815
Dammit! It's your fault
we've fallen so far behind,

241
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,283
you stupid Moss Head!

242
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,586
If we lose this
round, I'm...

243
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,187
Huh??

244
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,490
How'd this happen?!
The path is gone!

245
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,825
How in the hell
can anyone get lost

246
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,193
on a path like this one?!

247
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,095
You can see the old man
at the end of it!

248
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:11,131
Even your sense of
direction can't be that bad!

249
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,336
[thinking] I can
make up some time

250
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:17,238
if I use this as a short cut.

251
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,573
It's risky, but it's do or die!

252
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,412
Looks like Sanji is
taking a huge gamble!

253
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:32,486
Close one!

254
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,155
It seems that Sanji's
big gamble has paid off!

255
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,591
Now he's right behind the
lead group and closing in fast!

256
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,560
That's not fair! Hamburg! Hurry!

257
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,328
He's gaining on us!

258
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,664
What, what do you want?

259
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,301
In my opinion, it
never hurts to reduce

260
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,169
the number of
opponents you have.

261
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,106
Time for the three of
you to kick the bucket!

262
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,107
Oh, crap!

263
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,309
Nami! Usopp!
What do we do?

264
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,711
We have no choice.

265
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,213
[NAMI]
Everybody run for it!

266
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,247
[CHOPPER and USOPP]

267
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,317
Hey! Get back here!
You can't escape from me!

Iyyyaaaaa!!

269
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,420
[CAPOTE]
Come here! Now!

270
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,090
[LUFFY] Man, the old
stilt's guy's "Greeeeeeen"

271
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,493
is even longer than
it was last time!

272
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,394
Eh?

273
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,797
[snores]

274
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,499
He's sleeping?

275
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,167
[FOXY PIRATE B]
Hey! Wake up!

276
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,968
[ITOMIMIZU]
Wake up!

277
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,102
[FOXY PIRATE C]
Don't be sleepin'!

278
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,104
Green light, red light! Stop!

279
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:32,479
Dammit!

280
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,014
You're out!

281
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,451
[ITOMIMIZU]
Taken by surprise

282
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,652
that the "stop light"
was napping,

283
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:42,456
Capote was caught off guard,
unable to stop, and is out!

284
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,758
What kind of a weirdo
falls asleep standing up

285
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,427
leaning against
a rock like that?!

286
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,462
That old stilts guy
sure is something!

287
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,331
Hahaha!

288
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:54,435
[thinking] All right.
I'm within range now.

289
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,302
What the heck?

290
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,104
I thought this
would be an easy win!

291
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,772
Now I'm starting to get worried!

292
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,743
[ITOMIMIZU]
Now, the four frontrunners

293
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,546
are all within 100 meters
of the "stop light."

294
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,815
It's going to be a
mad dash to the finish!

295
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,451
One of these four will
most likely be our winner!

296
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,087
Which one will it be?!

297
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,655
[CROWD cheers]

298
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,258
All right, Sanji!
You can do it!

299
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,593
Nobody's paying
any attention to us.

300
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,562
[USOPP]
Yeah. Completely ignored.

301
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:25,131
[NAMI] This definitely feels
a bit useless, doesn't it?

302
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,671
[NAMI] Well, at least we
can take comfort in knowing

303
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:34,508
that we're not the
<i>only</i> useless ones here.

304
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,309
[ZORO]
The path ended again.

305
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,180
It's cold! I wanna
get this over with

306
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,482
so I can go eat
something warm.

307
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,719
[SANJI]
Outta my way!

308
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,122
All right, Hamburg!
Let him have it!

309
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,756
[HAMBURG]
This time, you're mine!

310
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,796
So, you wanna piece
of me, gorilla-man?

311
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,730
Puh! Puh!

312
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,766
You're mincemeat!

313
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,601
[ITOMIMIZU] Hamburg and Sanji
are now going head-to-head!

314
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,607
Meanwhile, Chiqicheetah is
racing towards the "stop light"!

315
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,741
So, by keeping him occupied,

316
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,244
it seems that Sanji has
fallen right into Porche's trap!

317
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,446
Oh, no!

318
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,420
[PORCHE]
Victory is ours!

319
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,255
Dammit!

320
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,823
[ITOMIMIZU] Chiqicheetah
is just a few leaps away

321
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,158
from touching
the "stop light"!

322
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,329
Eeeeeee...

323
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,613
You're out!

324
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:47,214
What?!
He was sneezing!

325
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,649
Tonjit hasn't even
started calling out

326
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,117
"red light, green light" yet!

327
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,486
He was just starting to sneeze!

328
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,155
All of that running and
speed was for nothing!

329
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,092
Chiqicheetah had a
false-start and is now out!

330
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,226
Dammit!

331
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,295
Don't sneeze in the middle
of the game, "stop light"!

332
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,029
I can't believe it!

333
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,197
We were so close
to winning, too!

00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:13,040
That crazy old stilts guy!
Even his snot is long!

Whew! That was a close one!

336
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,745
He was sneezing?
Puh-puh-puh!

337
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,546
Get a hold of
yourself, Hamburg.

338
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,648
This is no laughing matter.

339
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:21,815
We've just gotta
win this thing

340
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,717
so we can get my
little Choppy back!

341
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,053
[ITOMIMIZU] Both teams are
closing in on the "stop light,"

00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,621
and with only a
short distance to go,

343
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,524
the next play should determine
the outcome of the game!

344
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,259
But which player will it be?

345
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,362
The duo of Porche
and Hamburg?

346
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:39,199
Or Sanji?
We'll find out soon!

347
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,602
The moment of truth
is about to begin!

348
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,604
Greeeeee--

349
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:45,372
[ITOMIMIZU] The "stop light"
is definitely calling out

350
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,408
his line this time!
This is it!

351
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,386
Pardon me!

352
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,289
Hamburg! Come on!
What are you doing?

353
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,558
...eeeeeeeeeen
Liiiiiiiiiiiigh--

354
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:09,129
Robin's personal savior
has arrived to save the day!

355
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,397
Oh! Sanji!

356
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,565
No way!

357
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,266
What happened to Porche?

358
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,270
Stop squirming around, Porche!

[TONJIT]
Reeeeeeeeh--

360
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,407
And now that I've brought
Robin back to our crew.

361
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,509
She'll definitely
fall in love with me!

362
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,112
[LUFFY]
Hey! Sanji! Touch him!

363
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,181
You gotta touch
him to win the game!

364
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:29,216
All right.
Time to win this thing.

365
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,052
Thanks for everything,
old timer.

366
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,322
[shrill shriek]

367
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,324
[PORCHE screams]

368
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,394
[ITOMIMIZU]
Sanji has turned around

369
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,695
and started running
back down the trail

370
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,197
before touching
the "stop light"!

371
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,265
What is he doing?

372
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,432
Even if she's the enemy,

373
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,435
I can't abandon
a lady in distress!

374
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:52,806
Incredible!

375
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,676
The nefarious cook Sanji
has saved our beloved Porche!

376
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:59,246
--eeeeeed Liiiiiight!

377
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,514
[ITOMIMIZU] Hamburg
is desperately trying

378
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,583
to hold on while
remaining still.

379
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,352
But Sanji is most likely
going to be out of the game,

380
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,421
despite his valiant and
heroic rescue of Porche.

381
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,194
No, wait! There's Sanji!
And he has Porche!

382
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,630
Not only that, but he seems
to be holding completely still,

383
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,432
despite his current situation!

384
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,533
He's out in the
middle of the water,

385
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,735
but not moving
an inch! He's safe!

386
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,571
[FOXY PIRATE D]
Impossible!

387
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,472
How can he be standing
out there like that?!

388
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,541
There's no way he's
touching the bottom!

389
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,544
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! I get it!
He's treading water!

390
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,279
And he's doing it
while carrying Porche

391
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,715
and keeping his upper
body completely motionless!

392
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,417
He's just like a swan on a lake:

393
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,419
Kicking furiously
beneath the surface,

394
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,554
while looking elegant
and graceful above!

395
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,556
As long as the "stop light"
can't see him moving,

396
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,425
he's undeniably safe!

397
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,394
Sanji is incredibly
determined to win!

398
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:53,100
[thinking] No matter what
happens, I will save Robin!

399
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,167
Sanji still has a chance

400
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,703
to touch the "stop light"
and claim the victory!

401
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,739
Chirp, chirp!

402
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,441
[FOXY PIRATE E] He risked
everything to save his enemy!

403
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:01,475
Impressive, Mr. Cook!

404
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,311
Sanji, you're awesome!

405
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:10,551
Oh, my! I could really
fall for you, Mr. Cook!

406
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,552
[ITOMIMIZU]
No!

407
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,188
Both Porche and Sanji
have dived underwater!

408
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,156
You two moved. You're out!

409
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,528
Hey, what's your problem?
Just keep swimming!

410
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,563
Do you want me to
drown or something?

411
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:28,068
Oh, what have
I done? Sweet Robin!

412
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,237
Greeeee--

413
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,605
[ITOMIMIZU] And with
the "stop light's" call,

414
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,407
the game is once
again under way!

415
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,808
The only competitors
left in the round

416
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,112
at this point are Hamburg
of Team Foxy, as well as...

417
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,680
[NAMI] We're almost
to the "stop light"!

418
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:41,682
[USOPP]
There's nobody left to stop us!

419
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:42,683
[CHOPPER]
I don't believe it!

420
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,785
We're going to be the
first ones to touch him!

421
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,121
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh--

422
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,756
Come on! Let's all
touch him together!

423
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,357
Yeah!

424
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,324
Amazingly enough,

425
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,227
the forgotten trio of
Straw Hat slowpokes

426
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,330
are now poised to be the first
ones to touch the "stop light"!

427
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,765
What an amazing turn of events!

428
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,766
Who would've even
thought it possible?

429
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,673
[ZORO] Just when I finally
get to the real path.

middle of it. Outta my way!

This is it!

00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:21,255

are about to win!

435
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:24,391
Yeah! We win!

Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-- Oh!

438
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,442
[ITOMIMIZU] Hamburg
is the first player

439
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,143
to touch the "stop light"!

440
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,279
Congratulations to Team Foxy,

441
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:50,050

Dash Touch Domination game!

That's two victories in a row!

We're gonna sweep
you in this rematch!

What happened? Is it over?

You're the one who
ended it, you idiot!

447
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,397
And you totally ruined
everything for us!

448
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,299
This is all your fault, Zoro!

00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,301
[fireworks blasts]

450
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,672
That's all right.
It doesn't matter.

00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:12,739
I'm up next.

452
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,142

his crew back, no problem.

Feh-feh-feh!
Haven't you forgotten

454
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,780
an important little fact,
Straw Hat?

455
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,215
That was your second loss,

456
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,816
so in addition to Nico Robin,

457
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:25,786
you are about to lose one
more member of your crew!

458
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,621
On top of that,
you can only win back

459
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,590
one crewmember per event!

460
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,258
Therefore, even in the slimmest,

461
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,662
most inconceivable chance
that you win the next round.

462
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:37,665
Come on. Get to the
point, Split-Head.

What he's trying
to say, Captain,

465
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,536
is that there's only
one more round remaining.

466
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,173
So even if you win it, you
can only take back one person.

467
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:48,075
Huh?

468
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:49,777
So no matter what
does or doesn't happen

469
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,612
in the next round,
the fact remains,

470
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,748
you've already lost one
of your crewmates forever!

471
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,083
