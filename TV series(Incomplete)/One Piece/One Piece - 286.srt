1
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,791
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,328
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,165
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:50,136
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,339
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,440
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,677
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,280
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,516
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,753
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,155
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,393
Shut up! Just let me go!

13
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,094
I'm guessing Lucci's
that pigeon guy?

14
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,763
Yeah, that's him.

15
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,264
From what that freak told us,

16
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,366
he's the only one they've
got guarding Robin.

17
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,468
Our best bet's to
send Luffy after them.

18
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,038
Luffy, since you're
raring to go,

19
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,639
you can hunt down
that pigeon guy.

20
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,108
Let me go! Let me go!

21
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,811
Excluding Luffy, we've
got a headcount of six.

22
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,481
And he said there're only
five CP9 agents with keys.

23
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,415
So I say we spread out,

24
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,118
take them down,
then catch up with Luffy.

25
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,356
If they drag her across those
gates, we'll never get her back!

26
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,325
It's a race against time!

27
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,660
Then let's get going!

28
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,665
Take 'em down, or we die trying!

29
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,733
Yeah!

30
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,635
Good luck!

31
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,007
There's no help
for you, Nico Robin!

32
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,511
You can keep wishing
for them to come,

33
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,480
but they'll never find their
way to the Gates of Justice!

34
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,723
Quit hiding from me,
you pigeon loving jerk!

35
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:24,398
Chapapapapapapapapapapa!

36
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,499
You've come face to face

37
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,402
with the gossip
loving Silent Fukurou!

38
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,237
I suppose you want my key?

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,740
Great, just before
I could refill my cola.

40
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,474
Chapa.

41
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:42,116
Yoyoi! You damn
despicable pirate!

42
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:46,086
Your hopeless quest for your
friend's freedom has doomed you

43
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,689
to die a dreadful
death by my hand!

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,328
So you're too afraid
to face the mi--

45
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,067
It's not empty.

46
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,535
This room better not be empty!

47
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:08,308
Dammit. I'm getting'
real tired of this.

48
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,319
What's wrong? Just relax.

49
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:45,312
Yo! Yoyoi! Ha! Yoyoi!

50
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:56,056
Dear girl. Are you ready?
That is--Ready to die?

51
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,794
Yeah right, like I'm gonna
fight you to the death.

52
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,530
All I need to do is get
the key and get out of here!

53
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,399
Here goes nothing!

54
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,135
Hey assassin! Where's your key?

55
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,038
Let's see.

56
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,079
Yes. As you say. The key.

57
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,148
Yeah? Yeah? Go on.

58
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,385
Yes. The key.

59
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,320
Right, right, the key.

60
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,189
Yes, the key.

61
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,391
Good, that's it.

62
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:34,094
Why, the key is
right here, of course.

63
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:38,499
Oh, how peculiar!
Where did it go?

64
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:42,269
I thought I had it here.
Or was it here?

65
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,204
Jeez, this guy is annoying.

66
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,744
That won't do at all, I fear.

67
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,480
The water needs
to be much warmer

68
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,383
if you want to make
good tea, Mademoiselle.

69
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,524
You can't ever ignore
the golden rules, right?

70
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:08,462
Warm your teapot beforehand,
boil fresh water and pour it in.

71
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,331
Now, you let it set
until the bubbles

72
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,199
are the size of little coins.

73
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,568
By doing that, you give
the leaves some time

74
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,170
to dance around in the water.

75
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:19,073
Spreading their flavor and
aroma everywhere they go.

76
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,076
After that, you quickly
place a cover over the pot,

77
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,078
and let it steam for one minute.

78
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,149
Finally, you pour it into
warm teacups and enjoy.

79
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,119
A bit of consideration
makes a world of difference.

80
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,688
Wow, you're an expert!

81
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,191
Well, I am a chef.

82
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,093
Thank you, for the lesson.

83
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:43,763
My pleasure!

84
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,611
Wow, looks like I made it.

85
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,481
Well, at least I hope so.

86
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,382
I've had enough of these stairs.

87
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:08,622
Robin! Hey! Robin! It's me!

88
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:14,327
Hey! Hello?

89
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,500
Damn. Too late.
Guess they left already.

90
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,106
Ugh, that jerk. Oh!
Wait a second. Right!

91
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,742
It doesn't matter, since
I know where they're going!

92
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:31,545
All I gotta do is head
to the Gates of Justice

93
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,647
and I'll catch 'em in no time!

94
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,418
Why don't you save me the
trouble of cutting you down?

95
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,120
You have the key? Or not?

96
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,189
Don't be a fool.

97
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,524
You may have been a
bit of a disappointment

98
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,459
back at the Galley-La mansion,

99
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,828
but I expect to be
entertained this time.

100
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,797
If you pirates
could make it this far,

101
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,733
then you're far more capable
than I gave you credit for.

102
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,735
Humph. Got that right.

103
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,105
Make that mistake again,
and you'll be dead.

104
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,442
Maybe so. You're like a beast.

105
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,811
That savage look in your eyes.

106
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,680
But I can be
pretty beastly myself.

107
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,118
You know, for the record,

108
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,621
I'm the strongest
swordsman in all of CP-9.

109
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,689
This won't be easy.

110
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,757
Hmph. Two Sword Style?

111
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,364
Tempest Kick.

112
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,312
Sorry, I use four swords.

113
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,180
Well that's fine by me.

114
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,316
Your whole body is a weapon,
isn't it? What's the difference?

115
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,209
Hmph.

116
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,420
Seventy-two Caliber--

117
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,590
Tempest Kick White Thunder!

118
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,157
--Phoenix!

119
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,529
Shave!

120
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,548
This is fun!

121
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,322
Yeah? Well, I don't have
time for fun right now.

122
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,258
Shame. Guess you'd better
kill me quickly, then.

123
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,263
Tempest Kick Slaughter!

124
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,443
He's throwing out
everything at once.

125
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,644
What is this?

126
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,689
Bastard. Are you
taking this seriously?

127
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:31,158
Of course! I'm quite impressed!

128
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,527
But you said you were
in a hurry, didn't you?

129
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,732
My new power should
speed things up for you.

130
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,619
Wh--what the hell?

131
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,799
This sure isn't
what I was expecting.

132
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:23,410
A little gardening is nice and
all, but this is way overboard.

133
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,245
It's like we're outside!

134
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,847
Okay whatever.

135
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,817
I gotta focus on getting
the key to Robin's handcuffs!

136
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,384
Here we go!

137
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:40,727
Careful. Carefu--
No, don't stop.

138
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,532
Just keep quiet
and you'll be fine!

139
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:51,738
One step at a time.
Easy does it. Eas--

140
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:03,384
That was scary!
Okay, time for round 2.

141
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:08,122
Move in quietly.
Run away quietly.

142
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:13,227
Take the key and leave
a hero. No need to fight.

143
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,294
That's right.

144
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:19,733
I'm Sniper King, but today,
I'm Lucky King, too!

145
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,112
Hey! Heart!
You're beating too loud!

146
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,415
Cut it out! Stop!

147
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,255
That's not what I meant!

148
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,424
You stupid heart!
Do your job, damn it!

149
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:46,093
You trying to kill me?
Wait, heart massage!

150
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,461
Yeah heart massage, here we go!

151
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:55,536
That was scary!
Okay, pull it together.

152
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,606
I got this. I can do
anything I put my mind to.

153
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,210
I'm a miracle worker!
A magic man! Probably.

154
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:09,383
I can do it. I can do anything.

155
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,420
I can. Huh? What is that? A bee?

156
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,655
Go away! Shoo! Shoo! Huh?

157
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,791
That's not a flower, you know!

158
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,560
There's no pollen
in there! Trust me!

159
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:24,297
Go away! I said go!

160
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,240
What's with that look?

161
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,742
Oh, you're kidding me.
Oh no, you don't.

162
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,777
Don't you dare.
Don't. Don't do it. No.

163
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,383
My nose! Why?

164
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,458
Damn it!

165
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,826
Now I'm right back
where I started!

166
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,528
But hey, he still
didn't wake up!

167
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,597
This guy's seriously out cold!

168
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,332
If I can just go a few steps

169
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,601
without anything ridiculous
happening, I've got this!

170
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:12,679
Tiptoe. Tiptoe.
Easy does it, Usopp.

171
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:34,601
Here we go.
Still asleep. Still asleep!

172
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:48,215
Just a bit more. An itty
bitty bit. Almost there.

173
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,354
A rooster? Are you kidding me?

174
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,155
I'm right there and
the noisiest bird

175
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,657
in the whole stinking
world shows up?

176
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,396
If he crows, I'm finished!

177
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,399
That assassin guy will wake up
and wipe the floor with me!

178
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,268
What's that look?
Are you gonna crow?

179
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,370
You're gonna crow,
aren't you? No, please.

180
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,672
Please. Sh. Sh.

181
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:15,276
Rooster. Mr. Rooster.
Master Rooster, sir.

182
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,211
I'm begging you, don't crow!
Don't say a word!

183
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,213
Just-- just take some time
and think it over! Please!

184
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,314
Chirp!

185
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,351
Roosters don't chirp! Come on!

186
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,654
Oh. Hey pirate.

187
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,823
Curse you rooster!

188
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,293
Guess it's time to
kick your ass, then.

189
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,196
Curse you!

190
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,515
He's strong.

191
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,386
So it's you, huh?

192
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,090
You're the slingshot guy that
burned down the flag, right?

193
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,163
Too bad sniping
won't help you here.

194
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,736
He just woke up from his nap

195
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,504
and he's already
hitting that hard?

196
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,207
Sorry pal, that punch
was kinda sloppy.

197
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,575
Not my style.

198
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:24,578
Bet it hurt, though.

199
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,491
I know I look scary,
but I'm no sadist.

200
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,693
I like my fights
clean and simple.

201
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:43,564
He's got Devil Fruit powers?

202
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,333
The Dog-Dog Fruit, Model Wolf!

203
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,503
I'll just tear out your
windpipe, and that'll be that.

204
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:53,374
You're gonna die anyway, so no
need for you to suffer, right?

205
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,276
See? Simple.

206
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,643
A wolf?

207
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,281
Damn.

208
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:04,118
Hm? Hold on, you sure?

209
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,753
You don't look all that tough.

210
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,222
D-don't try to intimidate me!

211
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,689
I'm not giving up!

212
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,391
Got it?

213
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,561
I came to save Robin and
that's what I'm gonna do!

214
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,734
The ceiling? What's going on?

215
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,573
Damn! I was trying to
use my man-beast form,

216
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,708
but I messed up on the man part!

217
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:31,645
There's a talking giraffe
falling through the ceiling!

218
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,516
Your power is so
awesome. I love it!

219
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,051
A wolf?

220
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,620
What the-- Is this
place some kinda zoo?

221
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,632
Ox-Ox Fruit. Model Giraffe.

222
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,502
Kaku, you poor bastard.

223
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:58,004
I told you not to eat
that fruit, didn't I?

224
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,042
And what's so wrong with
being a giraffe, huh?

225
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,711
For your information,
I happen to like it, okay?

226
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,250
That pigeon guy was
a leopard, wasn't he?

227
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:12,453
That makes three people
that transform into animals.

228
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:16,490
Does that mean the rest of
CP-9 has powers like that, too?

229
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:20,761
A wolf-man is one thing,
but now a giraffe-man, too?

230
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,730
This is insane!

231
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:26,133
How am I supposed to
deal with two Zoan types?

232
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,337
Actually, now that Zoro's here,
it's two-on-two, isn't it?

233
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,705
Or more like two on one,

234
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,408
with this guy cowering in
the corner and watching.

235
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,712
"For your information,
I happen to like it!" Huh?

236
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,148
I mean, who can
blame you, right?

237
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:44,251
Since giraffes are
so cool and all!

238
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:46,587
Yeah, they are!
You gotta problem?

239
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,823
Do giraffes and wolves
not get along or something?

240
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,792
'Cause they sure
hate each other.

241
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:56,597
What's that? Looks like
someone left a safe open.

242
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,367
Wait! Are those weird looking
handcuffs what I think they are?

243
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,238
That's enough! Stop laughing!

244
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,572
Hey, giraffe!

245
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,776
Could you shut up?
I'm in a hurry.

246
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,179
If you zoo animals wanna argue,
do it on your own time.

247
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,181
But if you just
wanna stand there,

248
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,350
your neck is an easy target.

249
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,585
You fool!

250
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:19,219
Don't underestimate
the limitless

251
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,222
destructive
power of giraffes!

252
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,326
Behold my Man-Beast Form!

253
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:32,299
I have been reborn
with unspeakable power!

254
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,180
Whoa, that is lame!

255
00:20:46,213 --> 00:20:48,748
But I-- What? No!

256
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,756
Wh-why did I say
something so stupid?

257
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:57,725
I mean, he does look
pretty ridiculous,

258
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,326
but that's not the point.

259
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,696
If I lose my composure,
he'll have the advantage.

260
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,235
Are you going to sit there
and laugh all day or what?

261
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,071
S-- sorry.

262
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,306
Hmph.

263
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,445
Can't do it! Too funny!

264
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,054
Damn it. This is
harder than I thought.

265
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:30,223
Why does he have to be so
square and funny looking?

266
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:35,462
Huh? Wait, where did
these handcuffs come from?

267
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,466
Oh no. Whoops! Sorry!

268
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,368
What the hell are
you trying to pull?

269
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,304
Well, I was thinking
those are probably

270
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:46,173
the same Sea Prism
handcuffs they put on Robin.

271
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:49,043
Our enemies both have
Devil Fruit powers, y'know?

272
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:52,146
So I thought if I cuffed them,
they'd be easier to beat!

273
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,549
Then why didn't you put the
handcuffs on them? Why me?

274
00:21:55,582 --> 00:22:01,288
Be-- because I--The giraffe
guy's face is too funny!

275
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,256
My hand slipped!

276
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,326
"I'm not square,
I'm cool, right?"

277
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,764
That's brilliant!

278
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,167
You're going to pay for this!

279
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,335
You're all going to pay!

280
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:19,440
I'll show you the
power of my devil fruit.

281
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,041
Then you'll be sorry!

282
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,542
Tempest Kick.

283
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,482
Oh boy, he's mad now!

284
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,686
Sky Slicer!

285
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,359
This isn't good.

286
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,459
Usopp, get down!

287
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,529
Damn it, now's not the
time to be having tea!

288
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:18,265
Oh, that's too bad.
Are you in a hurry?

289
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:19,767
Robin's life is at stake here.

290
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,369
If you get in my way,
I won't go easy on you,

291
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,804
no matter how beautiful you are!

292
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:27,207
In that case, I suppose
tea time is over.

293
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,109
On the next One Piece:

294
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:33,647
"I Won't Kick, Even If It Costs
Me My Life! Sanji's Chivalry!"

295
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,782
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
