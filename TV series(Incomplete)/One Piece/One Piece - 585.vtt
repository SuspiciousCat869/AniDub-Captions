00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.557
who can't even defend himself
if someone attacks.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.126
So would you like
to carry me? Huh?

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.932
[SANJI] Damn it, as soon
as you have an ass to kick,

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.534
you best believe
I'm gonna kick it!

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.502
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.505
You show no mercy, even to
those who can do you no harm.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.674
You are a fearsome
foe indeed, pirate!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.844
[FRANKY] Maybe Nami found
a way out. Hurry!

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.213
[KIN'EMON]
That hur-- er, itches!

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.728
[CENTAUR A laughs] I blew those
intruders out of the water!

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:10.629
[BROWNBEARD]
No. Look again.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.897
Huh?

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.100
He sliced it in two.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.471
That the best they can do?

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:21.207
Good thing you're here, Zoro.
They can't sink us!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.577
Hey! You guys see my cool legs?

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.312
[CENTAUR A]
He cut the shell in half?

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.214
[BROWNBEARD growls]

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.950
Alright! Fire!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.620
Ah! That's way too many!

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:37.623
Well, they aren't terribly
welcoming, are they? A pity.

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:39.792
I know! We should be friends!

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.795
Now Gum-Gum... Legs Balloon!

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.897
[KIN'EMON]
Poot! Now what?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.832
No more legs!

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.938
The shells!
They bounced right off!

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.341
How the hell did
his body do that?

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.476
A Devil Fruit.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.147
[laughs] I know just
the thing for you.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.882
Prepare to fire!

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:06.152
[ZORO]
And here comes round three.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.155
They just don't learn!
Show 'em who's boss, guys!

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.456
[ROBIN]
Hold on.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.927
[ROBIN] Careful. They're aiming
right at the water.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.030
So instead of hitting us,
they plan to sink our boat!

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.432
[USOPP yelps]
But two of us can't swim!

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.134
what are we gonna do?

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.769
[BROWNBEARD]
We'll sink their vessel

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.872
and watch them
drown in the lake!

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.775
Rot in hell, trespassers.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.377
[gasps]

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.111
[grunts]

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.647
[USOPP yelps]

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.449
[LUFFY]
Uh-oh...

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.151
[BROWNBEARD]
Now!

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.190
[USOPP screams]

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:45.758
[grunts]

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.081
[gasps]

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.616
[USOPP]
Oh no!

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.687
[CREW grunting, shouting]

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.122
[ROBIN] The icebergs!
We should get behind them!

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.191
[USOPP grunts]
Good idea!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.393
[USOPP grunts]

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.229
[LUFFY yelps]

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:26.098
[USOPP pants]

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.967
That was almost too late.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.935
Well I didn't see you helping!

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.671
[cracking]

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.641
[shouts]

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:42.248
[BROWNBEARD laughs]
Oh, you can't swim?

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.084
Well, you shouldn't have eaten
those Devil Fruits then.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:48.254
You're done! Bon voyage!

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:58.664
[BROOK] I have never
been so disgusted! Ugh!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.966
How dare that horrid
ghost attack me!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.668
Unprovoked, I might add!

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.237
The nerve! The undead
should stick together!

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:09.708
What's he thinking, haunting me?
He was rather strong, too!

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:15.781
[pants]

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.017
[BROOK] I hear something
in the distance.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.652
Not that I have ears to hear it.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.520
[BROOK chuckles]

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.459
[BROOK] You're a persistent
ghost, I'll give you that!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:30.229
Very well. I shall fight you!

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:40.039
[BROOK]
Uh! Uh... Huh.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:42.841
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:46.645
Oh! Luckily, I don't have
eyes either! Ya, ha!

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:52.384
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A warbles]

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.287
[LUFFY] Hello? My name
is Monkey D. Luffy!

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.356
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates--

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.191
[USOPP] You don't
need to tell them all that!

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.527
[MAN A yells]
Someone help!

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.194
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.128
[LUFFY]
What's wrong?

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:06.365
[MAN A] Please, it's cold.
We need Boss!

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.534
[LUFFY]
Huh? It's hot where we are.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:12.805
[MAN A] My friends are getting
cut down one after another!

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.307
The samurai is gonna kill us!

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.508
[LUFFY]
And where are you?

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.043
[MAN A gasps]
Please hurry!

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:21.380
We're on the Island
of Punk Hazard!

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.649
We don't have much time left!

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.819
[MAN A yells]

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:30.155
[TASHIGI] He said "cold",
and named the island.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:33.425
Given those facts, it's almost
undeniable that the signal

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.894
was sent from here
on Punk Hazard.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.566
And you've met Straw
Hat before, haven't you?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.035
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.904
...Balloon!

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.106
[KID]
Repel!

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.607
[MARINES yell]

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.676
Now Room...

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:51.877
...And Shambles.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.112
[MARINES gasp]

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.414
[MARINE F]
You killed me! Ah!

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.683
[LAW chuckles]

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.885
[SMOKER] Two years ago,
during an incident involving

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:03.589
the Roswalds, a Celestial
Dragon family, you,

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:06.725
Luffy, and Kid
fought together.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.461
We know what happened at
the War of the Best, too.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.065
[LAW]
Quick! Hand over Straw Hat!

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:17.436
Hand him over and we can escape.
He'll die without my help.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:22.408
[SMOKER] Straw Hat escaped
Akainu's clutches,

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.276
and you helped him.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.718
[LAW]
All right, then. What now?

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.920
I happen to know you
Marines are pretty good

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:37.823
at faking those
distress signals.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.059
[SMOKER] If you're suggesting
this is a trap we set,

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.894
I'm sorry to say you're wrong.

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.262
Is that so?

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.798
Well, sorry, I have no
more information for ya.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.267
[SMOKER] You and I both
know that's bull crap.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.269
Now I wanna see what's
inside that lab.

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.939
[LAW] It's my vacation home,
that's all. So beat it.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:58.610
You abandoned this place, so why
can't a pirate come to relax?

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.946
I don't see anybody else around.

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:05.751
And if Straw Hat does show up,
I'll behead him for ya.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:08.854
If there's nothing else,
get lost.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:11.824
[gasps]

[LAW]
Hm?

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.034
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.538
[MOCHA] I told you!
The frozen people are scary!

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.874
[CHOPPER]
We gotta get outta here!

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:32.044
[NAMI] Hey look, there's a door!
I bet it leads to the outside!

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.712
[CHILDREN]
Yeah!

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:40.686
You hear those voices?
Somebody's in there!

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:43.055
[CHOPPER]
Wa-ha!

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:44.857
We're free now!

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.059
[NAMI]
Whoa, it's freezing!

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.327
[GIRL A]
We made it!

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.496
[SYND]
We're out of the building!

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.498
We're gonna be okay!

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.633
I get to see mom and dad!

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.535
It's cold, though!

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.637

[MARINE A] Uh, what exactly
are we looking at here?

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.717
[MARINE B]
Giant kids, a raccoon, a robot,

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:49.054
a severed head, and a lady who's
not dressed for the weather.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:50.856
I-I don't know where to start.

Not that you don't
look sexy in that top,

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.638
but you should cover up.

Oh yeah! We saw him at Sabaody!

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.552
[NAMI] Are you the creep who
kidnapped those children?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.755
You jerk! They're kids.
What's wrong with you?

There should be a back door!
Try to find it! Go on, hurry!

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.947
What would bring the Navy
to a place like this?

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.817
Beats me! Let's just go!

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.853

was a shock for me, too.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.802
[TASHIGI gasps]
Marines!

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:13.005
Track down the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.340
[MARINE C gasps]
Aye-aye, Captain!

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.142
Come on men, follow her!

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.110
[MARINES cheer]

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.511
Wait, stand back!

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:20.746
[LAW]
Room.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.181
[gasps]

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:28.053
[MARINES groan]

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.454
Everybody all right?

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:30.689
[TASHIGI grunts]

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.928
[LAW] Those fools bring
trouble wherever they go.

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.698
[LAW]
And, Takt!

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.135
[rumbling]

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:45.237
What the hell is... that?

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.413
[SMOKER]
Huh?

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.190
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:09.261
Oh no!

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.631
[gasps]

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.236
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.879
[MARINE C] The battleship,
it's floating in midair!

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.881
[MARINE D]
The river's up there, too!

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:33.385
What the hell?
That makes no sense!

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.387
[LAW]
I lied to you for your own good.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.690
You should've listened.
Now that you've seen the truth,

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.093
I'm afraid I can't
let you leave.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.863
[MARINE G gasps]
We're so screwed, aren't we?

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.498
[SMOKER]
Stay behind me.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:52.270
You're no match for Law.
He'll dismember you on the spot.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:59.745
[MARINE G laughs]
Yeah! Go Smokey!

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:05.050
[MARINE F]
Kick his smarmy ass!

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.353
[MARINE G]
Show him the G-5 means business!

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:19.564
[NARRATOR] With Law suspending
the ship in midair,

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:22.434
the G-5 Marines have
been overpowered.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.503
The stubborn warlord's
mischievous actions

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.671
bring about an unforseen
predicament for Nami

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.340
and Sanji as well.

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:31.243
Elsewhere, Luffy's team
also encounters trouble

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:34.179
while crossing the lake to
get to the frozen lands.

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.947
One the next One Piece!

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:40.152
"In a Real Pinch! Luffy Sinks
into the Ice-Cold Lake!"

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.788
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
