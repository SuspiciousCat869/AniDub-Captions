00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.104
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.140
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.843
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:12.078
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.214
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:17.050
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.319
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.221
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.891
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:29.929
â™ª Opening Song

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.489
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.526
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.764
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.333
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:50.537
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.438
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.874
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.443
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.248
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.750
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:07.587
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.791
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.497
[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.966
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.570
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:27.006
Receiving a distress call,
the crew lands on Punk Hazard,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.642
an island split into two
sections with extremely

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.810
different climates:

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.513
the Burning Lands
and the Ice Lands.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.582
After some of the crew
were taken captive,

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.850
Luffy and the others made
their way to the Ice Lands

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.519
to rescue them.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.888
But, little did the
Straw Hat Pirates suspect

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.390
that some familiar faces
from past adventures

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.727
would also be waiting
for them on the island.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.031
[LAW] So tell me, what brings
you to my vacation home,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.933
White Hunter?

00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.573
[LUFFY]
"The Warlord! Trafalgar Law!"

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.608
[grunts]

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:39.412
[TASHIGI]
Trafalgar,

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.547
I understand you're
one of the Seven Warlords,

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.817
but we need to get past.
Please step aside!

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:47.954
It's over.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:51.291
We already know you're not the
only one hiding on this island!

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.294
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.597
[BOY A]
Mommy! Daddy!

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.072
Hey. What you
said to me earlier.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.974
About how you guys
aren't sick anymore.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.742
Yeah, what about it?

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.511
What was it like before?

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.747
I mean, like what kind of
disease did you guys have?

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.982
No clue.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.184
All they told us is that we were
real sick and that it would

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.086
take us a whole year
to get well again,

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:22.121
so we had to come
here and rest up.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.356
[grunts]

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.827
[CHOPPER] A year? And they
didn't tell you what was wrong?

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.829
Nuh-uh.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:32.632
I guess maybe my parents
found out I was sick

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.534
and asked the people who
work here to pick me up

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.035
and help me get better.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.137
And that's how I ended
up at this place.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.839
That doesn't seem right.

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.708
Your parents really
sent you away?

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.210
[BIYO] Mm-mm. I was just
playing outside one day

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:46.612
and those people showed
up out of nowhere.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.047
Then they brought me here.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.782
They said I had to go
with them right away

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:53.019
or else my mom and dad
might get infected too.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.887
I didn't even get to
say goodbye to them.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.022
[NAMI]
What about you guys?

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.157
[GIRL A, B]
Yeah, same here!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.794
[NAMI] Huh. This sounds like
straight-up kidnapping to me.

00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:03.629
[CHOPPER] So a bunch of
strangers took you to some

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.833
weird place without letting
you say bye to your parents?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.968
That could only mean one thing.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.536
You kids are really sick!

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.505
They were lied to, obviously!

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.841
[CHOPPER] You're not
getting too tired, are you?

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.876
I can always carry
you on my back!

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.344
[yelps]

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.514
[NAMI chuckles]
Oh no. They're fine.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.416
Yeah! We'll be okay!

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.052
Because the Master takes
really good care of us!

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:27.186
[NAMI]
The Master?

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.522
Yeah. He's so nice!

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.057
Master!

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.063
[GIRL A, BOY B]
Master!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.702
[NAMI] Hold on. Hasn't it
been more than a year

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:44.170
since you were
brought here, though?

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:47.440
Chopper, you should examine them
as soon as we find the time.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.143
[CHOPPER]
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:58.751
[NAMI pants, grunts]

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:01.621
[NAMI] Oh, great, the door's
locked! We're stuck!

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.055
[SYND]
Huh?

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.625
[MOCHA] But... But they're
gonna catch up to us!

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:06.793
[GIRL C]
What do we do?

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.394
I'm working on it!

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.730
[CHOPPER]
Nami! I got this!

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:13.032
[CHOPPER]
Hyah!

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.101
[CHOPPER]
Don't try this at home, kids!

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.571
[CHOPPER]
Ha! You can thank me later.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:19.772
[CHILDREN cheer]

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.540
[BOY C]
He did it!

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.208
[NAMI]
You're handy these days.

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.377
[MOCHA]
Yeah, good job, Mr. Raccoon!

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.913
[CHOPPER giggles]
I am not a raccoon!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:29.115
But you do look like one now.

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:30.616
--You're right!
--[NAMI] Okay!

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.452
We should hurry up!

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:36.489
[yelps] It's cold!
Chopper, give me your fur!

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:40.059
Oh yeah, sure thing.
Hold on, no way!

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.761
[NAMI]
Where are we?

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.464
Does this lead outside, or is
that some kind of freezer?

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.732
It's way too dark to see.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.735
[CHOPPER] Ha! The temperature's
perfect if you ask me!

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.738
[NAMI] Yeah, well you're
from a Winter Island.

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:55.308
Looks like we can walk on this.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.344
Agh, I can't see. Oh wait, look!

00:07:58.377 --> 00:07:59.779
There's a door back there!

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:00.780
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:03.015
[NAMI]
Let's go see what's behind it!

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:07.453
No, stop! It's scary! We can't!

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.822
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.858
What's wrong? Let's go!

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.759
Come on! They'll catch us!

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:14.994
But I can't,

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:17.530
because that's the way they
brought me in when I came here!

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.867
Really? Great, that means
it must be an exit then!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.537
I know it's cold, but you
can make it! Come on!

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.339
No, it's not that!

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.742
[MOCHA]
It's, um...

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.549
[MOCHA]
Look around.

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:37.984
Huh?

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.356
[NAMI]
What?

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:45.858
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:50.329
[NAMI] It looks like there's
something inside the wall.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.311
[NAMI, CHOPPER scream]

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:09.048
[MOCHA] See? It's scary 'cause
the walls are full of people!

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.384
[CHOPPER]
Are those corpses?

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:14.387
[NAMI]
Encased in walls of ice?

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.089
And the ceiling. Look!

00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:21.027
[CHOPPER gasps]
The floor too!

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.197
[NAMI, CHOPPER whine]

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.233
[MOCHA] You're s'posed
to be the grown-ups!

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:29.101
Don't leave us!

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:29.936
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.644
[FRANKY]
Hm, I hope that's enough.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.747
You already blocked their way,
that's all we needed!

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:42.915
Let's go!

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.818
I swear I heard Nami screaming
her lungs out just now.

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:50.089
If she's professing her love
for me, then I have to be there!

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:54.894
Uh. Anyway, who are those guys?
Half man, half sheep?

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.429
Isn't there some kind of
creature like that

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.964
from a fairy tale?

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:00.132
[SANJI] Sorry Franky,
but identifying fairy-tale

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:03.502
characters is pretty far down
my to-do list right now.

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:05.738
I've got a damsel to save first!

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:09.275
[KIN'EMON]
Wait! Unhand me then! Leave me!

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:12.812
I did not see my son among all
the children we set free!

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.680
Perhaps there are
more rooms here!

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:15.948
Allow me to stay and--

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:18.584
And what? You don't
have any arms or legs!

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.186
If I leave you here alone,

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.922
that means it's my fault if
anything bad happens!

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.457
I can't have that.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.127
I care not! My only goal
now is to save my son!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.530
Argh! You're on my last nerve!

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:34.967
All you have to say is
"help me find my body!"

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.103
We'll help you!
Swallow your pride!

00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.472
Asking for help
from you pirates?

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:41.674
I would rather die!

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:48.547
However... I suppose if you
truly are that desperate

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:51.384
to locate the
rest of my body....

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.786
...I won't stop you
from searching.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:57.490
[SANJI] That's it! I'm not
taking any more lip from a head!

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.993
Well, if it's come to this,
I accept my fate!

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:03.829
At least I died with
my honor still intact!

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.164
[FRANKY]
Whoa, Sanji.

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.732
Destroying a helpless
severed head

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.001
won't make you
feel any better.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.469
[SANJI yells]

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.905
I mean, if you really
weren't taking his crap,

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:14.740
then you wouldn't have
brought him with us.

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:15.708
[SANJI]
Ah! But--!

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:17.009
[KIN'EMON]
Bleh...

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.711
Dammit!

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.646
This is driving me crazy!
I can't believe I was

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.015
stupid enough to be moved
by his determination!

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.650
He's not strong,
he's just stubborn!

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.085
I don't wanna help him!

00:11:26.118 --> 00:11:29.021
Yes, but I'm sure you must
pity a poor disembodied head

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.557
who can't even defend himself
if someone attacks.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.126
So would you like
to carry me? Huh?

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.932
[SANJI] Damn it, as soon
as you have an ass to kick,

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.534
you best believe
I'm gonna kick it!

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:43.502
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.505
You show no mercy, even to
those who can do you no harm.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.674
You are a fearsome
foe indeed, pirate!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:51.844
[FRANKY] Maybe Nami found
a way out. Hurry!

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.213
[KIN'EMON]
That hur-- er, itches!

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.728
[CENTAUR A laughs] I blew those
intruders out of the water!

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:10.629
[BROWNBEARD]
No. Look again.

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:11.897
Huh?

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.100
He sliced it in two.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.471
That the best they can do?

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:21.207
Good thing you're here, Zoro.
They can't sink us!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.577
Hey! You guys see my cool legs?

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.312
[CENTAUR A]
He cut the shell in half?

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.214
[BROWNBEARD growls]

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.950
Alright! Fire!

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.620
Ah! That's way too many!

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:37.623
Well, they aren't terribly
welcoming, are they? A pity.

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:39.792
I know! We should be friends!

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.795
Now Gum-Gum... Legs Balloon!

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.897
[KIN'EMON]
Poot! Now what?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.832
No more legs!

00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:52.938
The shells!
They bounced right off!

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:55.341
How the hell did
his body do that?

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.476
A Devil Fruit.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.147
[laughs] I know just
the thing for you.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.882
Prepare to fire!

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:06.152
[ZORO]
And here comes round three.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:09.155
They just don't learn!
Show 'em who's boss, guys!

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.456
[ROBIN]
Hold on.

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:14.927
[ROBIN] Careful. They're aiming
right at the water.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.030
So instead of hitting us,
they plan to sink our boat!

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.432
[USOPP yelps]
But two of us can't swim!

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.134
what are we gonna do?

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.769
[BROWNBEARD]
We'll sink their vessel

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.872
and watch them
drown in the lake!

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.775
Rot in hell, trespassers.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.377
[gasps]

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.111
[grunts]

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:34.647
[USOPP yelps]

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.449
[LUFFY]
Uh-oh...

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.151
[BROWNBEARD]
Now!

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.190
[USOPP screams]

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:45.758
[grunts]

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.081
[gasps]

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.616
[USOPP]
Oh no!

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.687
[CREW grunting, shouting]

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.122
[ROBIN] The icebergs!
We should get behind them!

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.191
[USOPP grunts]
Good idea!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.393
[USOPP grunts]

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:23.229
[LUFFY yelps]

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:26.098
[USOPP pants]

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.967
That was almost too late.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.935
Well I didn't see you helping!

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.671
[cracking]

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:35.641
[shouts]

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:42.248
[BROWNBEARD laughs]
Oh, you can't swim?

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.084
Well, you shouldn't have eaten
those Devil Fruits then.

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:48.254
You're done! Bon voyage!

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:58.664
[BROOK] I have never
been so disgusted! Ugh!

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.966
How dare that horrid
ghost attack me!

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.668
Unprovoked, I might add!

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.237
The nerve! The undead
should stick together!

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:09.708
What's he thinking, haunting me?
He was rather strong, too!

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:15.781
[pants]

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.017
[BROOK] I hear something
in the distance.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.652
Not that I have ears to hear it.

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.520
[BROOK chuckles]

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.459
[BROOK] You're a persistent
ghost, I'll give you that!

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:30.229
Very well. I shall fight you!

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:40.039
[BROOK]
Uh! Uh... Huh.

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:42.841
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:46.645
Oh! Luckily, I don't have
eyes either! Ya, ha!

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:52.384
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A warbles]

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.287
[LUFFY] Hello? My name
is Monkey D. Luffy!

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:57.356
And I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates--

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:59.191
[USOPP] You don't
need to tell them all that!

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.527
[MAN A yells]
Someone help!

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.194
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:03.128
[LUFFY]
What's wrong?

00:16:03.162 --> 00:16:06.365
[MAN A] Please, it's cold.
We need Boss!

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.534
[LUFFY]
Huh? It's hot where we are.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:12.805
[MAN A] My friends are getting
cut down one after another!

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.307
The samurai is gonna kill us!

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.508
[LUFFY]
And where are you?

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.043
[MAN A gasps]
Please hurry!

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:21.380
We're on the Island
of Punk Hazard!

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.649
We don't have much time left!

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.819
[MAN A yells]

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:30.155
[TASHIGI] He said "cold",
and named the island.

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:33.425
Given those facts, it's almost
undeniable that the signal

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.894
was sent from here
on Punk Hazard.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.566
And you've met Straw
Hat before, haven't you?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.035
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:45.904
...Balloon!

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.106
[KID]
Repel!

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.607
[MARINES yell]

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.676
Now Room...

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:51.877
...And Shambles.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.112
[MARINES gasp]

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.414
[MARINE F]
You killed me! Ah!

00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.683
[LAW chuckles]

00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.885
[SMOKER] Two years ago,
during an incident involving

00:16:59.918 --> 00:17:03.589
the Roswalds, a Celestial
Dragon family, you,

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:06.725
Luffy, and Kid
fought together.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.461
We know what happened at
the War of the Best, too.

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.065
[LAW]
Quick! Hand over Straw Hat!

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:17.436
Hand him over and we can escape.
He'll die without my help.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:22.408
[SMOKER] Straw Hat escaped
Akainu's clutches,

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.276
and you helped him.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.718
[LAW]
All right, then. What now?

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.920
I happen to know you
Marines are pretty good

00:17:34.953 --> 00:17:37.823
at faking those
distress signals.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:40.059
[SMOKER] If you're suggesting
this is a trap we set,

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.894
I'm sorry to say you're wrong.

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.262
Is that so?

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.798
Well, sorry, I have no
more information for ya.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:48.267
[SMOKER] You and I both
know that's bull crap.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.269
Now I wanna see what's
inside that lab.

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.939
[LAW] It's my vacation home,
that's all. So beat it.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:58.610
You abandoned this place, so why
can't a pirate come to relax?

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:00.946
I don't see anybody else around.

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:05.751
And if Straw Hat does show up,
I'll behead him for ya.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:08.854
If there's nothing else,
get lost.

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:11.824
[gasps]

00:18:11.857 --> 00:18:16.528
[CHILDREN yelling]

00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:17.796
[LAW]
Hm?

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.034
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.538
[MOCHA] I told you!
The frozen people are scary!

00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:28.874
[CHOPPER]
We gotta get outta here!

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:32.044
[NAMI] Hey look, there's a door!
I bet it leads to the outside!

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.712
[CHILDREN]
Yeah!

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:40.686
You hear those voices?
Somebody's in there!

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:43.055
[CHOPPER]
Wa-ha!

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:44.857
We're free now!

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.059
[NAMI]
Whoa, it's freezing!

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.327
[GIRL A]
We made it!

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.496
[SYND]
We're out of the building!

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.498
We're gonna be okay!

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.633
I get to see mom and dad!

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.535
It's cold, though!

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.637
[FRANKY]
Hello there, boys and girls!

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.805
[CHILDREN]
Huh?

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.306
[CHILDREN cheer]

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.476
[FRANKY]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Franky!

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.179
â™ª Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Franky the Tank! â™ª

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.515
â™ª A super-duper tank's
here to save the day! â™ª

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:12.217
â™ª Gonna squash anybody
that gets in my way! â™ª

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:14.386
[FRANKY laughs]

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:16.989
Except for cute baby
animals and stuff.

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:20.692
Super! I'm Franky
the Tank, whoo!

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:23.996
Now. You guys ready?

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:25.697
[CHILDREN] Yeah!

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.200
[ALL]
One, two, three!

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:32.137
Super!

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:37.176
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.245
It's the Straw Hats
and... children?

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:43.448
[MARINE A] Uh, what exactly
are we looking at here?

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.717
[MARINE B]
Giant kids, a raccoon, a robot,

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:49.054
a severed head, and a lady who's
not dressed for the weather.

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:50.856
I-I don't know where to start.

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:51.890
[BOY D]
Tank treads!

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:52.925
[BOY E]
So cool!

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.759
[BOY F]
Wow!

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:54.927
[BOY G]
He's a tank!

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.562
[BOY H]
Awesome!

00:19:56.595 --> 00:20:00.032
[FRANKY] I'll trample all
the bad guys for ya! Woo!

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:02.768
Nami swan!
Thank goodness you're safe!

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:05.070
Not that you don't
look sexy in that top,

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:06.638
but you should cover up.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.941
Don't want my darling
to catch a cold!

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:11.543
Oh good. Thanks, Sanji.

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:14.913
[NAMI gasps]
That guy! I know him!

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.616
Oh yeah! We saw him at Sabaody!

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:20.552
[NAMI] Are you the creep who
kidnapped those children?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.755
You jerk! They're kids.
What's wrong with you?

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.425
[SANJI gasps]
Why is he here?

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:29.895
Smoker! I'd recognize
that ugly mug anywhere!

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:32.664
And Tashigi! Lookin' good!

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.834
Wait a sec! The Navy's here too?

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.936
Change of plans, kids,
we can't get out this way!

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:38.971
Look for another exit!

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.974
[CHILDREN shouts]

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:46.078
There should be a back door!
Try to find it! Go on, hurry!

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.947
What would bring the Navy
to a place like this?

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.817
Beats me! Let's just go!

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.853
[SYND] But... I always thought
the Navy were good guys.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.188
[SANJI]
Fine, go with them!

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:59.324
[SYND] No! I don't want to,
they look kinda mean!

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.193
[SMOKER grunts]

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.297
So you did lie.
There are others here!

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.101
Guess so. Huh. But that
was a shock for me, too.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.802
[TASHIGI gasps]
Marines!

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:13.005
Track down the
Straw Hat Pirates!

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:15.340
[MARINE C gasps]
Aye-aye, Captain!

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:17.142
Come on men, follow her!

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.110
[MARINES cheer]

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.511
Wait, stand back!

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:20.746
[LAW]
Room.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.181
[gasps]

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:28.053
[MARINES groan]

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.454
Everybody all right?

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:30.689
[TASHIGI grunts]

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.928
[LAW] Those fools bring
trouble wherever they go.

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:39.698
[LAW]
And, Takt!

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:43.135
[rumbling]

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:45.237
What the hell is... that?

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.413
[SMOKER]
Huh?

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:05.190
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:09.261
Oh no!

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.631
[gasps]

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.236
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.879
[MARINE C] The battleship,
it's floating in midair!

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.881
[MARINE D]
The river's up there, too!

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:33.385
What the hell?
That makes no sense!

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.387
[LAW]
I lied to you for your own good.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.690
You should've listened.
Now that you've seen the truth,

00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:41.093
I'm afraid I can't
let you leave.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.863
[MARINE G gasps]
We're so screwed, aren't we?

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.498
[SMOKER]
Stay behind me.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:52.270
You're no match for Law.
He'll dismember you on the spot.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:59.745
[MARINE G laughs]
Yeah! Go Smokey!

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:05.050
[MARINE F]
Kick his smarmy ass!

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:08.353
[MARINE G]
Show him the G-5 means business!

00:23:17.028 --> 00:23:19.564
[NARRATOR] With Law suspending
the ship in midair,

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:22.434
the G-5 Marines have
been overpowered.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.503
The stubborn warlord's
mischievous actions

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.671
bring about an unforseen
predicament for Nami

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.340
and Sanji as well.

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:31.243
Elsewhere, Luffy's team
also encounters trouble

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:34.179
while crossing the lake to
get to the frozen lands.

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.947
One the next One Piece!

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:40.152
"In a Real Pinch! Luffy Sinks
into the Ice-Cold Lake!"

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.788
I'm going to be
King of the Pirates!
