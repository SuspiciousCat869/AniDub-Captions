00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.966
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.502
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.785
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:16.492
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.330
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.363 --> 00:03:20.467
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:22.772
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.110
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:28.416
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.688
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:32.992
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:36.600
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.169
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.541
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.612
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:46.352
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:50.226
Welp! Time to deliver
that ass kicking! Let's go!

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.329
[LAW]
Wait!

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.199
What, Traffy?

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.970
[LAW] Doflamingo isn't
someone you can pummel

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:56.439
with your sheer will alone.

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.042
You need to keep a level head.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.180
What? There's no way
I'm cooling off!

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:01.449
I'm totally fired up!

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:03.253
I'm telling you, if you
don't take my advice,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.090
you're gonna be
in for a bad time.

00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:06.761
[LUFFY]
Stop bossing me around!

00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:08.564
I promised Rebecca
I'd take care of him,

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:10.367
so butt-out and let me
handle it my way!

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.004
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Uhh, eporting in.

00:04:12.037 --> 00:04:14.041
I have eyes on
Straw Hat and Law!

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.344
They're near the pool courtyard.

00:04:15.377 --> 00:04:16.479
[SUGAR]
Roger that.

00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:17.949
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cuh-lick.

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:21.524
[SUGAR]
I spent a decade of my life

00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:24.596
increasing their numbers
little by little.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.370
Thousands of toy slaves
at our disposal.

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:31.576
But that imbecile

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.685
destroyed years of my
hard work in an instant.

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:40.227
Hurry it up, Kanjuro!
We are in a crunch here!

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.865
[KANJURO]
Stay calm! It's near completion!

00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:47.609
[SUGAR]
Revenge won't take long.

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:50.915
Just a brush of my hand and pow!

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.453
Farewell, Straw Hat.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:54.623
In that split second,

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:57.829
it'll be as though
you never existed.

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:02.470
Everyone will forget you,
you trash.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.147

[TOWNSPEOPLE grunting]

00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:29.726
The final stroke
is laid! What beauty!

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.464
My apologies for
the wait, Sir Usopp!

00:05:32.497 --> 00:05:33.968
Such things can take a while!

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.005
Wait. It's done?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.851
Yeah, this should do!

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:43.754
Lovely craftsmanship!

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:45.157
I disagree.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.031
I'm no expert, but this looks
quite unwell to my eye.

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:51.703
Nah, it's fine. We'll make do!

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:55.043
[TOWNSMAN A]
Faster! Keep going!

00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:56.312
[TOWNSMAN B]
Don't fall!

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:58.717
[TOWNSMAN C]
Get ready, King Riku!

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.155
[USOPP]
All done!

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:05.865
Interesting form of ammunition!

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.505
Yep! This bad boy
is the "Bagworm"!

00:06:10.942 --> 00:06:14.682
And it's gonna create a level
playing field with Sugar.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:20.394
[USOPP]
Viola!

00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:22.898
I need your Clairvoyance
to back me up.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.974
I'll want you to relay
every move Sugar makes, okay?

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:28.109
Ready.

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.654
With such a great deal at stake,

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:36.559
are you sure this is
the correct measure?

00:06:38.496 --> 00:06:40.568
[USOPP] It's not like
I got other options here.

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.738
Sugar's already on the move.

00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:45.310
But I am the sniper.

00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:47.649
This is where I shine.

00:06:47.682 --> 00:06:52.090
I take out enemies from afar
and protect my team!

00:06:57.134 --> 00:07:00.975
Viola. Make me proud.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:02.511
Right.

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:37.014
I can see her now!

00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:38.885
Sugar's approaching
them from the back!

00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:40.153
Thanks!

00:07:40.186 --> 00:07:42.758
Hey, Captain Tank and Hack!

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:44.227

We'll provide cover.

00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:48.804
Where are you going?

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:52.378
There is a sea of furious
people drawing closer.

00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:56.754
[TOWNSPEOPLE grunting]

00:07:56.787 --> 00:07:59.291
[DOLDO] They're bewildered
and desperate.

00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:01.296
They may even be
coming for my head.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:04.201
Run away! I can't stop this!

00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:12.384
[DOLDO] Without harming
a single one. We'll stop them.

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:15.456
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.862
[DOLDO]
We have no other choice.

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.601
The last thing I wish to do
is hurt my people further

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:23.908
by playing into Doflamingo's
wretched game.

00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:27.615
All we need to do is
stall time while they aim.

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:32.057
Sounds like a plan
to me, old king guy!

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:48.890
[VIOLET] Usopp! Sugar's nearing
your friends at a steady pace!

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.566
[VIOLET]
They are in her line of sight!

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:54.602
Keep your eye on her!

00:09:02.017 --> 00:09:03.219

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:10.634
They're here! It's King Riku!
Viola! Kin'emon!

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.872
And God Usopp!

[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:22.792
[TOWNSMAN J]
Round them all up, guys!

00:09:22.825 --> 00:09:25.865
We'll take 'em
straight to Doflamingo!

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:27.702
--Ya ready?
--For sure!

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:31.342
Remember.
No injuries whatsoever.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.847
[USOPP]
I better make this count!

00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:37.988
We must help him stem the tide!

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:39.659
I concur!

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:46.573
Why is "kicking someone's
ass black and blue"

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.644
always your answer
to every problem?

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:49.846
What's wrong with that?

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.885
It always seems to
work out fine for me!

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.703
[SUGAR] Neither Trafalger Law
or Monkey D. Luffy

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:04.475
know who I am
or what I look like.

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:07.715
This should be a real cake walk.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.505
Can you two help me?

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:38.076
Why's a little kid here?

00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:44.856
[crying] Daddy! Mommy!
Where are you?

00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.696
It sounds like she got lost.

00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:50.934
In a place like this?
I don't think so.

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:55.276
[LUFFY]
Hey. You need help?

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:56.312
[LAW]
Just ignore her.

[SUGAR cries]
I don't like this mean man!

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:20.159
Let's ditch her.

00:11:20.192 --> 00:11:23.066
It's dangerous around here,
so go find a hiding spot.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:29.110
I'm scared! Please don't
leave me alone!

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.805
[USOPP]

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:45.812
Mark my words!

00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:47.549
None of us shall run!

00:11:47.582 --> 00:11:48.784
Nor will we harm you!

[HACK] Come on,
pull yourselves together!

00:12:11.128 --> 00:12:12.196
[KIN'EMON]
Whatever the cost,

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.434
I shall not let you
near Sir Usopp!

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.538
[KANJURO]
Halt! None shall--

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.472
None shall--

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:18.977
Hey! None shall pass!

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.685
[USOPP]
Don't get distracted!

00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:24.187
My apologies!

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.360
[USOPP] Ya' gotta tell me
her exact location.

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:29.231
Look at the top of the tower.

00:12:29.265 --> 00:12:31.034
You see the windows?

00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:36.546
[USOPP]
Yeah.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.024
[VIOLET] I can see
Straw Hat through the one

00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:44.829
just right of the
most centered window,

00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:47.166
but there's iron bar over it.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:55.316
[USOPP]
What do the bars look like?

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:02.463
[VIOLET] There's one vertical
and three running horizontally.

00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:05.169
From a glace, I'd estimate
that the bottom of the window

00:13:05.203 --> 00:13:07.775
is around four feet
off the ground.

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.580
Which is approximately
Sugar's height.

00:13:12.016 --> 00:13:14.955
And how big are
the bottom two panes?

00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:18.997
Fifteen inches tall
by twenty wide.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.105
Barely big enough.

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:33.292
[USOPP]
Where is Sugar now?

00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:35.296
[VIOLET]
She's still behind the column.

00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:39.170
[SUGAR crying]

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:40.607
Let's go.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.779
Don't leave me alone! Help me!

00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:46.084
Sorry, we've got something
to take care of.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.896
Please! I'm begging you,
don't leave me!

00:13:51.929 --> 00:13:54.935
I'll give you these! Don't go!

00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:00.346
[VIOLET]
Sugar's advancing.

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:03.252
She should be in the
middle any moment now.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.327
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.433

don't move, I'll make you!

00:14:13.172 --> 00:14:16.813
[DOLDO] Everybody! Please!
You must back away!

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:19.518
[USOPP]
My target's behind a wall.

00:14:20.787 --> 00:14:23.927
[USOPP]
If I miss, it's bye-bye Luffy.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.537
Here! They're so yummy!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.674
[LUFFY gasps]
They are?

00:14:30.707 --> 00:14:32.276
[SUGAR]
Mm!

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.880
Seriously?

00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:37.120
What's your problem?
She offered to share!

00:15:40.547 --> 00:15:44.120
[VIOLET] Sugar's now in the
center of the bottom left pane.

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.278
[VIOLET]
She's drawing closer to them.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.021
[gasps] Are you all right?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.519
[USOPP]
I can't... hold still!

00:16:29.646 --> 00:16:32.551
[USOPP]
Damn it!

00:16:49.785 --> 00:16:51.354
[USOPP gasps]

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:53.560
[LAW gasps]

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.645
No!

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:04.414
[USOPP gasps]

00:17:16.104 --> 00:17:19.477
[USOPP] I have to nail this,
no matter what!

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.051
[VIOLET gasps]

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:28.462
[USOPP] Hey, Luffy!
I know you can't hear me,

00:17:28.496 --> 00:17:31.435
but I really don't wanna hit
the seas without you, buddy!

00:17:31.469 --> 00:17:34.876
Plus, this kingdom
needs you right now!

00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:38.349
[USOPP] This shot has
your name on it, Sugar!

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:43.392
There's no way your
Family... stops us here!

00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.215
[USOPP]
What's going on?

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:16.124
[USOPP]
I can see... their auras!

00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:19.263
[USOPP]
There's Luffy!

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:24.140
[USOPP] This is it!
Everything rides on this!

00:18:24.174 --> 00:18:26.512
Super Grown-Up
Great Black Kabuto!

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:30.787
Special! Long-Range
Attack! Bag Worm!

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:41.709
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:47.621
[USOPP] A breeze flowing
from west to east.

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:52.664
[USOPP]
A wind force scale of four.

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.252
[USOPP]
A slight tailwind.

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:05.724
We got him now!

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:06.692
[USOPP]
Two.

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:07.894
One.

00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:12.137
[USOPP] The first booster!
Exploding Star!

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.376
A slight ascension,
the rear disengages.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.384
Two seconds later,
another booster fires off.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:24.862
[USOPP]
The outer shell falls.

00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:26.633
The ammo launches horizontally.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.503
It's rocketing at
the Rampart Tower,

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.241
towards the lower left pane.

00:19:31.274 --> 00:19:36.018
It soars through the bars
and stays on course!

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:39.825
Steadfast towards its target!

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:41.228
[SUGAR]
Huh?

00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:44.868
[USOPP] It's not a direct hit,
but that's intentional.

00:19:54.187 --> 00:19:58.428
[SUGAR screams]

00:19:58.462 --> 00:20:01.134
[USOPP] Its objective
is to reignite trauma!

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:07.981
[SUGAR screaming]

00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:13.793
[USOPP]
Luffy. I got your back.

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:20.240
[USOPP]
Even if you don't realize it.

00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:22.644
Just keep pushing ahead!

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.657
[KANJURO]
Sir Usopp.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.729
Why you requested your
likeness inscribed puzzles me.

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:34.669
You can turn it into
a tangible object, yeah?

00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:36.338
Yes, but...

00:20:36.371 --> 00:20:40.647
Just do it! I gonna
use it for ammunition!

00:20:43.553 --> 00:20:45.056
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Sugar, no!

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:47.961
Damn it, she's knocked
out cold again!

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.844
[CAVENDISH]
They stopped?

00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:57.681
So they did.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:08.335
[BARTOLOMEO] Uhh... What,
they're just falling apart?

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:10.205
[ROBIN]
Something happened.

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:12.944
[CAVENDISH]
Yes, the question is what.

00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.392
Astounding! You pulled it off!

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:23.498
You truly are
a remarkable sniper!

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:26.805
The princess?

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:30.947
Excellent work, Usopp!
Sugar is down for the count.

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:33.653
[chuckles]

00:21:33.686 --> 00:21:35.189
Incredible!

00:21:35.222 --> 00:21:37.761
Is it true? He's triumphant?

00:21:37.794 --> 00:21:39.497
[TANK]
Huh?

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.870
I'm impressed, Sir Usopp!

00:21:41.903 --> 00:21:43.907
Such an impossible feat!

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.217
[USOPP pants]
Hell yeah.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.622
How are they?

00:21:51.655 --> 00:21:54.661
They're both fine. Nice work.

00:21:58.503 --> 00:22:00.941
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Wake up! No!

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:02.644
It's time to go!

00:22:14.868 --> 00:22:17.339
Mingo! We're here!

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:26.692
And they've just
made it. At last.

00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:31.903
[VIOLET] Now let's hope they
end the final battle, quickly!

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:37.948
I see. [chuckles]
Good luck, Luffy!

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.618
Welcome to my roost.

00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:42.558
Please disregard the mess.

00:22:42.591 --> 00:22:45.863
I wasn't expecting
any company this late.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.145
So, do tell me.

00:22:53.178 --> 00:22:56.318
What brings you
vermin here today?

00:22:56.351 --> 00:22:59.090
I'm here to whoop
your sorry butt!

00:22:59.124 --> 00:23:00.893
Same here.

00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:06.705
How sad for you.

00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:15.790
[NARRATOR]
Luffy and Law finally come

00:23:15.823 --> 00:23:17.827
face-to-face with Doflamingo!

00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:20.299
Unfortunately, the two
pirates soon fall prey

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:21.902
to his cunning provocations.

00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:23.806
Manipulating Bellamy
as a weapon,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.346
Doflamingo has Law and Luffy
in the palm of his hand.

00:23:27.379 --> 00:23:29.084
Their only hope
is to strike back

00:23:29.117 --> 00:23:30.520
with everything they've got!

00:23:30.554 --> 00:23:32.189
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.222 --> 00:23:33.458
"Anger Erupts!

00:23:33.492 --> 00:23:35.797
Luffy and Law's
Ultimate Stratagem!"

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.769
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
