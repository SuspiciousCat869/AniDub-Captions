If I can do it!

173
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:55,468
[chuckles]

174
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,271
Hey! Give that back!

175
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,307
Did you seriously think you
could kill me with this toy?

176
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,942
[chuckles] Oh, please.

177
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,610
A sweater can produce
more electricity

178
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,811
than this little thing.

179
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,948
Well, we won't know unless
I try, so give it back to me!

180
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,050
[NAMI yells]

181
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,289
[NAMI]
Come on, think!

182
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,890
I have to distract her somehow

183
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,126
so she can't dodge
the Tornado Tempo!

184
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,627
What do I have to work with?

185
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,762
Uhh...

186
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,964
There are the three different
types of air bubbles,

187
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,634
and the extremely dry weather of
this country, but that's all!

188
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,004
If only there was just a little
more moisture in the air.

189
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,406
Wait! Moisture!

190
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,175
That's it! This thing
has a rain technique!

191
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:43,916
Rain Tempo!

192
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,151
Water tricks?

193
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,254
[NAMI]
Rotating Sprinkler!

194
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,188
Desperate.

195
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,991
No, I'm not! I've got
a plan, you'll see!

196
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,825
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
I don't think so.

197
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,828
I've had enough of
your party tricks.

198
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,300
And speaking of parties,
time to end this one.

199
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,201
Uh‐oh!

200
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,272
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Sea Urchin Stinger!

201
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,009
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER yells]

202
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,346
Now why don't you be a good
little girl for me and die?

203
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,717
[gasps]

204
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,691
If that'd been me instead
of the wall, oh, man!

205
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,894
Since you showed me something
interesting earlier,

206
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,697
it's only fair that
I return the favor.

207
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,367
[NAMI]
Now's my chance!

208
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,677
[chuckles]

209
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,749
[NAMI] Hot air rises while
absorbing moisture.

210
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,851
When it collides with cold
air that's descending,

211
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,721
it rapidly cools, and the
moisture gets frozen.

212
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,057
And then...

213
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,993
Now Spike‐Spike... Doping!

214
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,862
[yells]

215
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,096
[gasps]

216
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,898
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER] I told you
your life was over, didn't I?

217
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,734
Stinger Flail!

218
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:15,508
[screams]

219
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,192
[USOPP groans]

220
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,261
[USOPP] These wounds
are nothing, Chopper.

221
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,563
Just point me in the
direction of the battle.

222
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,434
Nothing can stop Usopp,
brave warrior of the sea.

223
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,803
I'll keep fighting even if
my arms get ripped off

224
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:44,937
or my nose gets broken

225
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,372
If you keep talking so much,

226
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,307
you're gonna cause
internal bleeding.

227
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,443
I'll shut up then.

228
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,578
[SANJI]
Huh.

229
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,580
Well, well. You're alive.

230
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,381
Huh?

231
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:55,981
Oh, man.

232
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,583
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Sanji!

233
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,385
[CHOPPER]
You're hurt!

234
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,889
So, does this mean
that you beat up Mr. 2?

235
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,958
Better believe it!

236
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,326
Here.

237
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,061
My‐My goggles!

238
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,230
So you got 'em back for me
from that creep, huh?

239
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,066
Thank you, Sanji!
Oh, you're the best!

240
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,568
Wait a minute. They're broken!

241
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,970
In that case, I take back
everything I said!

242
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,171
Thanks for nothin', ya jerk!

243
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,973
And they were the
latest models too!

244
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,442
Do you have any idea what I had
to do to get these things?

245
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,510
[SANJI]
Hey, look at that.

246
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,579
[USOPP]
Look at my poor goggles.

247
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,080
[CHOPPER]
Whoa!

248
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,582
[SANJI]
That must be the auxiliary force

249
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,584
for the rebel army.

250
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,419
[CHOPPER]
There's more of them?

251
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,587
Looks like it.

252
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,858
I guess Vivi wasn't able to
stop the fighting in time.

253
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,192
This is just great!

254
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:40,693
[EYELASH grunts]

255
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,928
Eh? What the hell?

256
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,431
Hey! Eyelash! It's about
time you showed up!

257
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,465
Where've you been hiding?

258
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,533
Let's hurry to the palace.

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,102
Maybe there's still a way
we can help Vivi out.

260
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,036
Come on!

261
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:51,871
[CHOPPER]
Right!

262
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,105
[SANJI]
Usopp, move it!

263
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,607
[USOPP]
I'm coming! I'm coming!

264
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,442
Hey, Eyelash, gimme a lift!

265
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,277
Wait! Stop! Don'tcha
see the bandages?

266
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,446
Help an injured
man out, would ya?

267
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,630
At least you've proven that
you're a first‐class expert

268
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:21,200
at something, even if
it is running away.

269
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,970
[gasps]

270
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,139
[NAMI]
Oh, right! The air bubbles!

271
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,409
[gasps]

272
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,512
[NAMI]
A cloud!

273
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,681
It's small, but it formed!

274
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,516
Just what are you
babbling about?

275
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,084
It's still not large
enough, though!

276
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,921
I've gotta make it bigger!

277
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,023
Cool Ball!

278
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,058
Heat Ball!

279
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,430
I've had about enough of this!

280
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,599
Time to die!

281
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,171
Stinger Flail!

282
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,178
Tell me. Are you
prepared to die?

283
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,380
How 'bout you?

284
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,583
You're just bluffing, girl.

285
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,692
Am I?

286
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:25,931

288
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,386
You're dead meat!

290
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,124
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER yells]

291
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,496
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
What?

292
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,565
[NAMI] Today's forecast
calls for pleasant weather

293
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,667
with stable humidity
and mild winds.

294
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,736
However, a high‐pressure
system will be moving in

295
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,571
sometime during the afternoon.

296
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,439
This could create
some strange weather

297
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,108
in one particular area,

298
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,978
so people in the vicinity need
to watch out for mirages.

299
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,583
And more importantly,
for tornados.

300
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,453
This is a centerpiece
of the whole weapon.

301
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,490
But it's a last resort,
and you only get one shot.

302
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,026
If you miss, it's over.

303
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,463
[NAMI]
If I miss, it's over.

304
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,134
[NAMI]
A tornado watch has been issued!

305
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,670
[NAMI]
I'll make it work. I have to!

306
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:42,541
Vivi's been there for all of us,
so I'll be there for her!

307
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,213
[VIVI]
Nami, please. Don't die.

308
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:51,483
Well, you can at least try

309
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,353
putting all of our lives
on the line together!

310
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,789
Aren't we friends, Vivi?!

311
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,297
[LUFFY]
There, now you see.

312
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,232
Now you understand.

313
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,237
[LUFFY]
I know how much you hate this.

314
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,074
You wanna get
Crocodile the most.

315
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,654
[NAMI]
Sometimes, it summons clouds!

316
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,823
Other times, it makes rain fall!

317
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,359
It can even produce wind!

318
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,495
But there's one more special
technique of the Clima Takt!

319
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:39,698
And I'm going to unleash
it for Vivi's sake!

320
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,267
[NAMI groans]

321
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,605
Something the matter?

322
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,409
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Oh, dear, it looks like

323
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,345
that left leg of yours
is pretty injured.

324
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,682
So much so, in fact, that I
doubt you could run away.

325
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,389

This is... It's nothing!

328
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,441
It doesn't hurt at all!

329
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,276
Do you have any idea
what kind of pain

330
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,612
she's been going through?

331
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,548
Compared to Vivi....

332
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,550
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Huh?

333
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,586
[NAMI] It doesn't matter if I
lose a foot or a leg or two,

334
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,555
or even an arm....

335
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,624
I don't care!

336
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,394
[NAMI]
Now!

337
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,732
Take this! Tornado..

00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,234
...Tempo!

00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,586
Huh?

00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,361
What? What? What? What? What?

342
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,298
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
What have you done to me?

Usopp! Vivi!

349
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,604
[ZORO]
Ya know...

350
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,740
That face of yours,
it sorta looks familiar.

351
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,442
And if I'm not mistaken,

352
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,711
you used to be one of the most
infamous bounty hunters

353
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,280
in the West Blue, didn't you?

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,317
Not to mention an
assassin, as well.

355
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,719
So what happened to you?

356
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:25,257
You went from top of the heap
to one of Crocodile's dogs.

357
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,227
Did you do it just to
get some nice scraps

358
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,562
by lickin' his hand like
a good little lapdog?

359
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,130
Shut up.

360
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,800
[ZORO]
Here, let me show you...

361
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,502
...the difference
in pride between...

362
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,473
[ZORO]
...your swords and mine!

363
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,343
Three‐Swords Style...

364
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,311
...Bull Needle!

365
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,149
Spider...

366
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,818
...Defense.

367

[yells]

368
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,136
[ZORO]
Huh.

369
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,506
So basically, your body
is as hard as steel.

370
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,776
Unless I can cut steel,
I can't defeat you.

371
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,878
[MR. 1]
That would be correct.

372
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,815
Smashing and cutting
attacks won't work on me.

373
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,219
Well, that bites, doesn't it?

374
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,187
I'm not capable of
cutting steel yet,

375
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,390
so I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

376
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,859
[MR. 1] Hmph. And what's
that, swordsman?

377
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,862
[ZORO] I'm gonna learn how
to cut it right here and now.

378
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,498
Really?

379
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,200
[ZORO] I've been waiting for a
challenge just like this one.

380
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,835
I've been telling myself
for a while now

381
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,205
that it's time to take my
skills to the next level.

382
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,809
When I defeat you, Mr. 1,

383
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,377
I'll be the swordsman
strong enough

384
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,480
to cut through anything,
including steel.

398

[ZORO] I swore on that day
I'd never lose again.

399
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,967
But the wall in front of me
now may be too large

400
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,335
for me to break through.

401
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,770
[MR. 1]
When you can't even scratch me,

402
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,472
there's only one way this
battle will end for you.

403
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,307
And that's with your death.

00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,610
[ZORO] What the hell do
I lack to beat this guy?

405
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,844
What is it?
