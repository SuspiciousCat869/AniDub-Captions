1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:40,910
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,582
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,587
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,490
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,861
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,296
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,766
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,703
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,606
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,809
[HILDON] Mistress Perona!

48
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
[HILDON] The master is
calling for a meeting

49
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,546
with the Mysterious Three.

50
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,948
[PERONA] What is that about?
Did something bad happen?

51
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,483
It would appear
that Straw Hat Luffy

52
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:21,851
has just been captured.

53
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,454
This will be the
debut of number 900!

54
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:27,891
[PERONA] Absalom!
What do you want?

55
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,893
I told you, I don't
like you in my room!

56
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,728
[KUMACY] Welcome back,
Mistress Perona.

57
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,695
Is there anything you need?

58
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,630
[PERONA] Yeah, I need
you to stop talking!

59
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,632
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

60
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,833
[KUMACY] All right.

61
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:38,902
Don't you think you're being
a bit too strict with Kumacy?

62
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,537
Or rather, way too strict?

63
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,572
[PERONA] Anyway, did you hear?

64
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,741
Master is calling for us.

65
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,512
[NAMI] It's a miracle
they haven't found us yet!

66
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,748
What were you thinking,
hiding in here?

67
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,683
We were better off before!

68
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:54,984
[USOPP] What do
you want from me?

69
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,819
You were freaking out
about that invisible guy

70
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,821
and I found something
to climb inside.

71
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,824
How was I supposed to know
it was a zombie, huh?

72
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,427
We'll run away as soon
as we get the chance, okay?

73
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,095
[HILDON] Master Absalom!

74
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,196
That's where you're hiding!

75
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,599
There's something important
I needed to tell you!

76
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,433
[ABSALOM] Yes?

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,434
[HILDON]
In addition to the pirates,

78
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,703
I'm afraid that we have
another unwanted guest.

79
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:14,504
[ABSALOM] Go on then.

80
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:17,407
It's him!
The Humming Swordsman!

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,908
He's back?

82
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:25,081
[FRANKY] Weapons Left!

83
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,358
[FRANKY] Nico Robin!
What the hell are those things?

84
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,428
Once we set our eyes
on you, there's no escape!

85
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,064
We've never once failed
to capture our prey!

86
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,966
We picked off your
friends one by one,

87
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,568
silently carrying them through
the ceiling of the mansion

88
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,870
without anyone noticing
a single thing!

89
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,539
Don't worry about your friends.

90
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,608
As soon as we carry you off,
you'll all be reunited!

91
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,911
Hope you enjoy the ride!

92
00:04:54,944 --> 00:05:00,083
[BROOK]
♪ Yo hohoho, yo hohoho.

93
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:03,386
Stop it! Who the
hell is singing that?

94
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,058
[BROOK]
Yohohohoho!

95
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:13,563
My goodness, it looks like you
came to this island after all.

96
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,631
[ROBIN] How did you
get all the way up here?

97
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,401
I jumped, of course.
I'm quite light.

98
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,635
Since you're here already,

99
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,071
I suppose there's no
point in holding back.

100
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,841
I'll tell you everything
I know about this island.

101
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,177
Who are you, huh?
You're not a zombie!

102
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,080
Does that mean you're
with these pirates?

103
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,682
Hold on. What're you--

104
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,985
[BROOK] Worry not, my friend.
I'm not going anywhere.

105
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,789
[BROOK] I'll put an
end to this, promptly.

106
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,764
[BROOK] Three-Verse Humming:
Arrow Notch Slash!

107
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,104
[LUFFY] "Luffy's
Emergency Situation!

108
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:57,607
The Ultimate

[FRANKY] Don't stop!
It can't die!

110
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,559
The damn thing's a zombie,
it'll get right back up!

111
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,631
You son of...

112
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,136
Hold on. You...
I know you from somewhere.

113
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,971
Yohohohoho!

114
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:32,575
Never fear. I've got this
under control.

115
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,510
[FRANKY] You do?

116
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:37,580
]Even the dead can be killed
if you know their weakness.

117
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,581
Huh?!

118
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,248
Huh?

119
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:48,491
[strangled cries]

120
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,261
The hell is that thing?

121
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,997
That thing would be
the soul of the zombie.

122
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:59,168
[FRANKY] Its soul? Why's it
coming out of his mouth?

123
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,204
No! Captain!

124
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,206
[BROOK] Go on.
Get out of here!

125
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,608
Return to your rightful owner!

126
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,631
Aaaaugh!!
Captain Tararan!

127
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,868
He killed him!
He killed our captain!

128
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,536
Captain!

129
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:37,140
[FRANKY]
You obliterated the guy.

130
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,575
How'd you do that?

131
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,544
I purified him.

132
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:42,879
Puri-what?

133
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,214
[SPIDER MOUSE 349A]
It's him! There's no doubt.

134
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,749
He's the Humming Swordsman!

135
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,251
He's the one who wreaked all

136
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:51,254
that destruction on
Thriller Bark five years ago!

137
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,789
We gotta report
this to the master!

138
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,832
Oh! I know that web feels
like it's stronger than steel,

139
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,734
but you can melt right
through it with fire.

140
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,835
Really?

141
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,491
Well I'll be damned,
you're right!

142
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,858
[FRANKY] Straw Hat and the
rest of the crew got captured.

143
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:21,959
So let's talk.

144
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,228
You seem to know a lot
about this creepy island.

145
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,296
[BROOK] I do.

146
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,399
It's just-- I'm not really
sure how to say this.

147
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,701
But if your friends have
already been captured,

148
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,336
then there's a
very high probability

149
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,305
that it's too late to help them.

150
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,241
Hey! Wait! What
d'ya mean too late?

151
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,810
Will you please refrain
from yelling at me?

152
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,146
I can't bear to
face such hostility!

153
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:47,018
But then again I am a
skeleton so I don't have a face.

154
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:50,655
Yohohohoho! Skull joke!

155
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:53,157
Don't bother.

156
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,092
He's already
dead, remember?

157
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,064
[BROOK] Anyhow. Try to be
serious for a moment here.

158
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:02,833
[ROBIN] I know he's annoying,
but he's still dead.

159
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,902
[BROOK] I tried to explain
this while aboard the ship,

160
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,871
but there was a great
deal of time many years ago

161
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,006
that I spent drifting
aimlessly about the sea,

162
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,175
lost and all alone.

163
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,210
When I thought that
I'd finally charted my escape

164
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:15,246
from this demonic sea,
my rudder broke

165
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,916
and I was cast even further into
the depths of this watery void.

166
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,117
And then it happened.

167
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,386
I suppose it was
about five years ago.

168
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,855
Much in the same way
that it happened to you.

169
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,192
The island of Thriller Bark
called out to me.

170
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,928
[BROOK] I was utterly desperate
to escape the Florian Triangle,

171
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,430
no matter the risk.

172
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:35,199
So I took a chance and
decided to scour the island,

173
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:38,102
hunting for parts
to fix the rudder.

174
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,973
Aaaah!!

175
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,875
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

176
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:47,044
Someone save me!

177
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:51,148
Help me! Monsters! No!

178
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,484
[BROOK] All that was to
be found on the island

179
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,721
was a horde of
monsters and zombies.

180
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,322
It didn't take long
before they captured me

181
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,791
and brought me to this building.

182
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:03,461
It was here that I witnessed
something incredible.

183
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:05,229
With me, was a kung fu dancer,

184
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:07,999
who had also been captured,
sometime before.

185
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,166
They brought him before

186
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,303
a stitched-up corpse they
referred to as a marionette.

187
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:13,170
Before I knew it.

188
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,239
One of the most
frightening creatures

189
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,775
I had ever seen appeared.

190
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,276
And then!

191
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:23,247
The dancer's shadow was
ripped right from his body,

192
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,448
and it was amputated!

193
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,951
[FRANKY] How is
that even possible?

194
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,787
[BROOK] I could hardly
believe my eyes when I saw it.

195
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,427
Luckily. I don't have eyes.
Yohohohoho!

196
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,996
Cut the crap!
I'm gonna beat you up!

197
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,297
[ROBIN] Now that,
I can approve of.

198
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:44,502
[fighting sounds]

199
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,877
It didn't take him
long to finish

200
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,347
with the dancer and
move on to my shadow.

201
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,949
[BROOK] Once your
shadow is taken,

202
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,785
you fall lifeless to the floor.

203
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,353
But the shadow remains active.

204
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:06,123
Struggling up until the moment
it's confined within the corpse.

205
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:08,392
[BROOK] And once
this act is complete,

206
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,562
I witnessed the marionette
go from lifeless meat

207
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,799
to a full-blown dancing zombie!

208
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,234
You gonna explain this?

209
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,235
[BROOK] It's the shadows.

210
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,304
It doesn't matter whom
the corpse belongs to,

211
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,839
the shadows retain
the characteristics

212
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,908
of the soul they originate from.

213
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,243
Of course, the shadow
at your feet is the same.

214
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,579
That reflection of your
soul, your other half,

215
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,848
if you will,
is intended to follow you

216
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:32,850
from birth until death.

217
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,019
Only one man possesses
the loathsome ability

218
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,988
to force those shadows
to submit to him.

219
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:42,326
A member of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea. Gecko Moria!

220
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:45,429
He's endowed with the power
of the Shadow-Shadow fruit.

221
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,498
Devil Fruit powers.

222
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,000
So he's the one
who stole your shadow.

223
00:11:51,202 --> 00:11:53,370
[BROOK] My shadow was stolen.

224
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,040
Someone took it from me,
several years ago.

225
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,007
But how?

226
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,176
[ZORO] Can something
like that really happen?

227
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,345
[BROOK] Yes. I'm afraid it can.

228
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,214
And in addition to
losing my reflection,

229
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,083
having my shadow stolen
means I can no longer exist

230
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:08,586
in the world of light.

231
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:13,390
In other words, I can never live
where the sun's light shines.

232
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:16,227
[ROBIN] Then what would happen
if you were exposed to sunlight?

233
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,363
If even a ray of sunlight
touched this body,

234
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,032
every inch that it fell upon,

235
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,869
would be reduced
to naught but ash.

236
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:29,874
[BROOK] The only
materials needed

237
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,242
to make a zombie are a corpse

238
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:34,211
and the living shadow of
some unfortunate individual.

239
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,881
But the zombies, you see,
are not merely corpses,

240
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,916
but a collection of
human and animal parts,

241
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,051
stitched together
by Dr. Hogback.

242
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,155
Moria's brilliant accomplice.

243
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,223
[BROOK] He collects the
corpses of legendary warriors

244
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:48,926
from around the world and,
using his medical expertise,

245
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,162
outfits their bodies
with new parts.

246
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:51,962
And trust me.

247
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:53,597
He's amassed quite
the collection.

248
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,000
A countless number of
monstrosities stored away

249
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,435
in his lab and
ready to live again.

250
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,404
Dr. Hogback,huh?

251
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,574
He was a well renowned surgeon
who disappeared some time ago.

252
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,009
And to think he's
been using his skills

253
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,477
to help a pirate ever since.

254
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,179
Huh... So...

255
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,414
These zombies aren't really
resurrected from the dead,

256
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,249
they've just got
somebody else's soul

257
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,285
working away
inside their bodies.

258
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:15,586
Precisely.

259
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:18,956
The personality and
fighting ability comes

260
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:21,659
from the shadow's original
owner, but the physical strength

261
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:25,596
is completely dependent
upon the corpse itself.

262
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,165
When these two elements
are both powerful,

263
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,969
their combination creates
a truly formidable zombie!

264
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:39,276
Which is why Moria is so eager
to get his wicked hands on those

265
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,111
with ample bounties
on their head.

266
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:42,146
[FRANKY] Well that makes sense.

267
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,648
At least we know why
we're being targeted now.

268
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,617
[ROBIN] I imagine one
of the greatest advantages

269
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,720
for Moria is the absolute
obedience that zombies provide.

270
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,288
He needn't worry
about winning the favor

271
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:53,157
of their original personalities.

272
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,959
A living army of such
powerful fighters

273
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,528
would be too difficult
for anyone to control.

274
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:58,662
Indeed.

275
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,965
And since the shadows he
takes have the same abilities

276
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:03,133
as their original owners,
then he has no need\

277
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,737
for the less-manageable
bodies they were attached to.

278
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,972
The stronger they are,

279
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,575
the faster he sends them out
to sea, before they wake up.

280
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,344
[FRANKY] But! That means!

281
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:15,012
We've gotta find our guys.

282
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:16,513
[BROOK]
They're all right for now.

283
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,549
There's still time to save them.

284
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,551
However, you must put
your complete trust in me

285
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:22,319
if you want to accomplish that,

286
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:25,656
as my experience will have
to serve as your guide.

287
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:29,159
What? Trust you?
Why should I?

288
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,531
Rejected! Skull shock!

289
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,001
It's been years since I've had

290
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,336
such an emotionally
engaging conversation--

291
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,275
it's so much fun!
Lalalala!

292
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,177
Are you going to tell
us what to do or not?

293
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,413
Sure.

294
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:57,121
Master Moria!
They're here, master!

295
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,725
Your three guests
have arrived, master!

296
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,194
They're early.
Show them in.

297
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,729
Right this way.

298
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:20,811
Welcome! I'm glad
you could make it!

299
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,213
Kushishishishi!

300
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,150
Now hurry and make me
King of the Pirates!

301
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,718
Of course!

302
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,255
[LUFFY] What'd you say
about King of the Pirates?

303
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,311
No one's gonna be
King of the Pirates but me!

304
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:56,914
Now untie these
damn ropes, you jerk!

305
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,148
Lemme outta here!

306
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:01,585
Usopp, Nami, Chopper, Sanji,
Zoro-- give me back my friends!

307
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,021
Where'd you put them?
You big, fat' onion!

308
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
Quite an energetic
fellow we've got here!

309
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,459
I take it this
is Straw Hat Luffy.

310
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:11,128
He looks like he could
barely tie his own shoes--

311
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,098
are you sure this is the guy who
took on the World Government?

312
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:15,132
Do you have any idea

313
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,002
why he's wearing the
armor of a zombie general?

314
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,603
[LUFFY] What's wrong
with all you people?

315
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:22,272
You never dreamed of
being a knight before?

316
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,474
[ABSALOM] And did
this dream of yours

317
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,010
involve getting your dumb ass
caught and thrown in a cage?

318
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:28,345
Hey! Y'know what,
Straw Hat Luffy?

319
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:30,381
You just dropped a
lot of names there.

320
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,984
But we've only caught three of
your guys so far, including you.

321
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,053
We've got Pirate Hunter Zoro,

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,455
and some lanky blonde guy
who was with your crew,

323
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,457
but doesn't seem
to have a bounty.

324
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,458
Huh?

325
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,294
Who do I know with
blonde hair besides Sanji?

326
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,967
No way! This is bad!

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,302
They caught Zoro and Sanji!

328
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,570
How's that possible?

329
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,572
They got them and Luffy?

330
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,308
No offense, but they're the
strongest guys on our crew.

331
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:01,145
How the hell were they
the first ones to get caught?

332
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,747
[USOPP] I don't know who
any of these guys are,

333
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,417
but they are
seriously dangerous.

334
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,218
[HOGBACK] That reminds me.

335
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:11,388
What happened to the three
you're in charge of, Perona?

336
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:13,257
I thought the Risky
Brothers were supposed

337
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,992
to deliver them to us.

338
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,393
[PERONA] They're supposed
to give them to Kumacy,

339
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:17,394
but they haven't yet.

340
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:20,064
Let's hope they didn't
escape during transit.

341
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,032
[USOPP] You hear that?

342
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,368
[USOPP]
They're talking about us!

343
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,374
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Oh no, the lid came off!

344
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:33,177
Huh? What happened?

345
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,289
[CHOPPER] Usopp!
Nami! Guys, we're okay!

346
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
Wake up!

347
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:53,230
[USOPP] Shut up!
Don't tell them, you bastard!

348
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:56,200
[PERONA] Didn't I tell you
to keep your mouth shut?

349
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,468
[ABSALOM]
You're too strict on Kumacy.

350
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,204
Unbearably strict,
you might say.

351
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,205
Among these three,

352
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,540
my bride-to-be is
the one to watch out for.

353
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,444
She caused a rebellion of sorts
in the middle of your garden.

354
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,781
Hey. Hang on a second.

355
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:13,217
Damn it, Hogback.

356
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,451
You... You better not have laid

357
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:17,454
a single sick finger on
my bride, you bastard!

358
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:20,591
Raaawwwr!
You bring her to me now!

359
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,626
Your bride doesn't want you.

360
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,728
[ABSALOM]
What, Cindry? What'd you say?

361
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:27,164
Aaaaah! Hey, c'mon, Cindry!

362
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,799
You're not helping matters here!

363
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:29,900
And by the way,

364
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,769
why do you always stand
in front of me like that?

365
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,471
She doesn't want you either.

366
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,440
Ahhh! Why did you say that?

367
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,408
That never once crossed my mind!

368
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,812
What do you think these guys

369
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:43,647
are planning to do now
that they've caught Luffy?

370
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,417
[CHOPPER] And Sanji and Zoro.
It's gotta be something bad.

371
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,586
[USOPP] Let's not forget
that we're in danger, too.

372
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,523
But it's not like we can
just abandon Luffy, right?

373
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,093
[KUMACY]
Uhhh...

374
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,595
Shut it.

375
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,532
That's right!
There ya go, just like that.

376
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:03,700
I don't care
what anyone says--

377
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,769
I've already decided
that she's the one

378
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,538
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life with!

379
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,206
I told you she doesn't want you.

380
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,508
Quit saying that!

381
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,544
Please, Cindry,
let's try to be polite!

382
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,812
Absalom's love life
is none of your business!

383
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:18,282
Nobody will ever
want him. Or you.

384
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,818
Aaaah! How can you be
so cold and hurtful to me?

385
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,355
There's someone out
there for all of us!

386
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,291
Shut up, enough already!

387
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,825
Your whining's
giving me a headache!

388
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,661
If those pirates
somehow get away,

389
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:33,497
I hold every one
of you responsible!

390
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,632
I gathered the
three of you here

391
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,801
to commemorate the birth,
or rather, the rebirth,

392
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:41,538
of a powerful new addition
to the crew of Thriller Bark.

393
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,873
[GYORO cries out]

394
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,242
[smack]

395
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,214
[NIN] He really is
quite impressive.

396
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:51,748
Master, the pirate's escaping!

397
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,650
He ate right through
the bars of the cage!

398
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,420
He did what now?

399
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,222
He ate the cage?

400
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,325
[LUFFY] Let's just see you
jerks try to catch me now!

401
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:03,160
[NAMI and CHOPPER]
Luffy!

402
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,561
[USOPP] Go!

403
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:08,732
Fasfasfasfasfas!
Such a promising shadow!

404
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,336
Hold on, Absalom.
We're in a tight space here.

405
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,870
Let me catch him, okay?

406
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,541
Yeah, I'd like to see
you try, slow poke!

407
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,677
Negative Hollow!

408
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:22,879
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo.

409
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,248
[LUFFY] Those things?

410
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:27,284
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Negative. Negative. Negative.

411
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,186
Negative. Negative. Negative.

412
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:30,754
[LUFFY] It did a dance
and split into three!

413
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,789
That's awesome!

414
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,425
I'm gonna catch it
and keep it as a pet!

415
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,230
[FRANKY] Fresh Fire!

416
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,433
Well, damn it.
Guess that didn't work.

417
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,937
I totally suck.

418
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,373
Everything I did this
week totally sucks.

419
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:51,475
Everything I've ever
done totally sucks.

420
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,543
I might as well
lie down and die.

421
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:55,379
Okay.

422
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:02,586
[LUFFY] I wanna die and
be reincarnated as a clam.

423
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,222
I can't cut it as a human.

424
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,325
[LUFFY] I'm not fallin'
for the same trick twice!

425
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,460
[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo.

426
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,136
[LUFFY] That's it.

427
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:23,807
I just wanna die and be
reincarnated as a sea cucumber.

428
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,843
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Negative. Negative. Negative.

429
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,912
[PERONA laughs]

430
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,614
First he wants to
be a pirate king,

431
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:34,818
then a knight, and now
a sea cucumber? Sad.

432
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,258
[LUFFY] Damn you! Let me go!

433
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,493
[MORIA] Let's illuminate
our friend here!

434
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,796
[LUFFY] What are ya
gonna do, ya jerk?

435
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,799
I'm gonna make you pay!

436
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:14,558
What? What the hell?
My shadow?

437
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,549
No, don't do it!

438
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:54,831
Ishishishi!

439
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:55,832
[MORIA] The shadow of a man

440
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,935
with a 300 million berry
bounty is all mine!

441
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,604
Now, we'll create
the most powerful

442
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,507
special zombie the
world has ever seen!

443
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:08,578
Kushishishi!

444
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:13,583
[USOPP, CHOPPER and NAMI]
Luffy!

445
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:20,090
[HOGBACK]
Fasfas!

446
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:22,692
This is the moment
of the century, Cindry!

447
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:24,594
[CINDRY] "When I saw
that giant, frozen in ice,

448
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:25,862
I simply couldn't stop shaking."

449
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:27,531
[HOGBACK] No fair!
That's my line!

450
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,732
[CINDRY] "I knew it
could be none other

451
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:31,067
than the legendary 'Continent
Puller' standing before me."

452
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:31,968
[HOGBACK] That's mine, too!

453
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:32,869
[CINDRY] "I'm gonna
be King of the--"

454
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,771
[HOGBACK]
You don't get to say that!

455
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,540
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

456
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,542
"The Warrior Known
as the 'Devil'!

457
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,477
The Moment of Oars' Revival!"

458
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,879
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
