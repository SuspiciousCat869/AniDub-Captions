let's take a closer look

00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,340
at the fake blueprints
that you left us.

Here at the bottom,

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,046
you can see the signatures
of three different shipwrights.

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:15,115
"Tom," "Iceberg,"
and "Cutty Flam."

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:19,086
And the company
name "Tom's Workers."

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,455
It struck a chord.
I thought to myself

8
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,625
"now where have
I heard that name before?"

9
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,726
In other words,

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:31,432

Cutty Flam, is still alive.

12

he goes by "Franky."

177
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,738
No! No way!

178
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,508
So noisy.

179
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,111
Anyway, the first floor
is about to set fire.

180
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,713
It won't be pretty.

181
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,083
But to be fair, the
culprits are just pirates,

182
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,318
you can't expect
them to be subtle.

183
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,253
You bastards!

184
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,460
That's nice of you to give us
credit for your attempted arson.

185
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,228
But I think that I'll pass!

186
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,162
What's one more crime,

187
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,699
when we're going to
execute you anyway?

188
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,273
[ROBIN]
Well...

189
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,475
I suppose I'll take
my leave now.

190
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:38,245
You've done exactly as
you were told. Good work.

191
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,082
Robin! Don't go!
You're still one of us!

192
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,051
This is farewell.

193
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,585
Robin!

194
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,758
Stop her...

195
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,459
Straw Hat.

196
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,731
[LUFFY] We finally found you.
I won't let you run away again!

197
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,233
Outta my way!

198
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,234
Iron Body.

199
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:14,381
How come nothing I do to
these guys even phases them?!

200
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,216
In addition to our
offensive techniques,

201
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,452
our training has also
given us the ability

202
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:22,256
to make our body as
solid as an iron wall.

203
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,090
Of course.

204
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,492
Your punches are
weak to begin with.

205
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:28,128
Okay, whatever, I said.

206
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,496
Outta my way!

207
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,164
Paper Art.

208
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,147
Whoa! Even though
he's big he sure is fast!

209
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,350
He's moving like his
body's made of paper!

210
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,456
Oh no.

211
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,690
Robin!

212
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,663
Move it!

213
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,765
Gum-Gum...

214
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,368
...Pistol!

215
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,602
[BLUENO]
Shave!

216
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,538
He disappeared!

217
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,209
My legs are so strong

218
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:18,578
that I can move faster
than your eyes can see.

219
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,347
[LUFFY]
Stand still!

220
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,815
Moon Walk.

221
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:26,152
In fact, I can even
leap off of the air itself.

222
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,222
He's flying!

223
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,060
Tempest...

224
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,594
...Kick!

225
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,566
[ZORO]
A slashing attack?

226
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,635
Get down! Hurry!

227
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,570
Why?

228
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,286
Luffy!

229
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,122
They did all that with
a single kick? No way!

230
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,056
[KALIFA]
Technically, it was

231
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,593
the sharp gust of
wind that followed it.

232
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,562
We call it the "Tempest Kick."

233
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,406
We met on your ship,
didn't we, Roronoa?

234
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,481
You said, you people
aren't real shipwrights?

235
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:32,452
So does that mean you
lied about the Merry, too?

236
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:37,390
Unfortunately not, I was quite
honest about my assessment.

237
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,795
I'm sorry to hear that.

238
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:06,253
[LUFFY]
Don't go, Robin!

239
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,456
We're not done talking yet!

240
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:14,461
No. It's over. This is
the last time you'll see me.

241
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,496
Robin!

242
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,574
Luffy! Go after Robin.

243
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,009
Whatever happens,
don't let her get away!

244
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,219
Confident, huh?

245
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,155
You really shouldn't
take your eyes off of me!

246
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:48,295
Zoro!

247
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,165
[KAKU]
Finger Pistol.

248
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,673
It turns out there are some
things more deadly than bullets.

249
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:06,213
[LUFFY]
What's your problem?!

250
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,149
Get out of my way!

251
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,819
All those punches, and
he's not even blinking!

252
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,421
[LUCCI]
I have him. Now go.

253
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,065
Robin!

254
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,234
[NAMI]
Luffy!

255
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,401
[CHOPPER]
Zoro!

256
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:13,814
I don't believe it.
How can they be so strong?

257
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,685
I knew you were tough,
but this's too much.

258
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,787
We're not like you.

259
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,258
As members of CP9, for as
long as we can remember,

260
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:28,128
we've trained to surpass
the limits of the human body.

261
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,730
And vowed to hone those skills

262
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,732
into an instrument
of absolute justice.

263
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,770
[LUCCI]
The results of that training

264
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:41,775
are the superhuman techniques
known as the Six Powers.

265
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,445
So now, I'm sure it's
abundantly clear to you,

266
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:48,582
why the four of us are the
government's most elite agents.

267
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:49,783
And by the same token,

268
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,419
you must also realize
how miserably weak

269
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,622
a band of pirates
is in comparison.

270
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,532
[LUCCI] Of course, the
full extent of our powers

271
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:08,535
is strictly classified
but rest assured,

272
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,605
scum like you would
never make the cut.

273
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,609
[KALIFA]
Lucci.

274
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:18,279
The ignition device
is about to detonate.

275
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,580
We should probably hurry.

276
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,081
Hmph.

277
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,251
But a chance like
this one is quite rare.

278
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,220
Let me show you
something interesting.

279
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,126
You're kidding me.

280
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,471
Lucci, what the hell is this?!

281
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,543
He's huge.

282
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:02,756
♪ ending song ♪

283
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,296
[LUFFY]
He sure is big!

284
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:17,097
[PAULIE]
Yeah, but what the hell is he?

285
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,366
[LUCCI] You don't like
my new look, Paulie?

286
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,267
What a pity.

287
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,268
[PAULIE] Still think
you can beat him?

288
00:23:21,301 --> 00:23:24,371
[LUFFY] Hmph! He's big,
but I've fought bigger!

289
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,141
[LUCCI] Hmph, I'll give
you a lesson in humility

290
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:28,609
you can take to the grave.

291
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,210
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i> :

292
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,479
"The Straw Hat
Pirates Annihilated?

293
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,515
The Menace of the
Leopard Model!"

294
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:37,250
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
