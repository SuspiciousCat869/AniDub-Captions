[ZORO]
He never moved his feet!

180
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,990
[ZORO grunts] Pagaya said
there were different types

181
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,242
of Dials up here.

182
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:18,288
I wonder if this guy has one
or two stuck to his shoes.

183
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,623
'Cause when he moves,
gusts of wind shoot

184
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,042
from his feet.

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,170
[ZORO]
What else could it be?

186
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,464
And those pistols of his
flash as bright as the sun,

187
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,300
blinding me every time he fires.

188
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,634
Where is he now?

has no clue about using Dials.

He doesn't even stand a chance.

Hey! Guess what this is!

201
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,679
Oh, no!

202
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,847

It's called a Milky Dial!

[ZORO whimpers]

204
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,438
You know, aerial combat
isn't just leaping around

205
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,190
out of desperation.

206
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,111
That looks big.

207
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:44,082
[ZORO] A ton of wood,
and these things would make

208
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:46,001
for a killer barbeque.

00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:11,276
That was stupid.
Wh-What's wrong with me?

212
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,361
[ZORO] This guy's
already faster than me,

213
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,573
and I hang myself
out like an easy target.

214
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,992
Ugh. And I got
a bullet in my leg.

215
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,660
Agh. Genius.

216
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:24,247
Gotta be something I can do
about those flashing pistols.

217
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,166
Hold on.

218
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:29,252
Those guns of yours
are pretty nice accessories.

219
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:33,882
But too bad for you.

220
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,426
I found my lucky goggles.

221
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:38,553
Which means
your little blinding trick...

222
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:41,556
...won't work on me anymore.

223
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,767
You might as well give up.

224
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,686
[BRAHAM] Those just
look like regular goggles.

225
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,646
[ZORO gasps]
He found me out!

226
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,233
Not a big fan of
my flash guns are you?

227
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:54,819
Being a swordsman, you
need close quarters to fight,

228
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,696
which I won't give you.

229
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,782
I don't understand your
reasons for being here

230
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:00,200
and I don't care.

231
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:02,243
But I will say that your mere
presence defines you as

232
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,871
an enemy of the Shandorians.

233
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:07,582
Now I'm telling you,
surrender or die.

234
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,251
Which might happen sooner
if we keep standing here.

235
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:13,463
That leg of yours
isn't getting any better.

236
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:17,384
Doesn't hurt too bad.
Barely made a dent.

237

[ZORO] Getting shot while
I made smug comments about

238
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:23,014
some big dead eel proves
I'm lacking in concentration.

239
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,768
All right.
Guess I found the perfect

240
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:30,397
situation to test
that technique again.

241
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,315

246
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,714
Think you can run away?

248
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,552
Sound. Smell.

249
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:03,221
Taste. Touch. And thought.

250
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:07,308
These six roots ground us all by
way of good, evil, and peace.

251
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,144
What are you talking about?

252
00:17:09,227 --> 00:17:13,189
[ZORO] And of course, each can
either be pure or impure.

253
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:16,067
These are the
36 earthly desires.

[BRAHAM]
Hmph.

255
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,905
Listen up, I have
the barrel of a cannon

256
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:23,033
aimed directly at your head.

257
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,952
And all you have
are a couple of pistols.

258
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:29,748
In both distance and power,
my weapon's superior.

259
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,666
You've done very well.

260
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,169
But you're still gonna die.

Hmph.

262
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,176

263
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,552
You're outta your mind.

264
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:45,972
All I see are three swords.

265
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:49,893
Have you ever seen
a Flying Blade Attack?

266
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,186

That looked uncomfortable.

274
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:30,100
Nothing personal,
being natural enemies and, all.

275
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:33,019
But you're in the dirt 'cause
I hate being told what to do.

276
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:34,562
No other reason.

277
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,152

Please find me!

I don't wanna be left on this
stinking island just to die

291
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,946
and turn into food
for gigantic bugs.

292
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,033
And if I do die, will there even
be a doctor waiting for me?

293
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,576
Wait, it doesn't matter.

294
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,536
When you're dead, you're dead,
and no doctor can save you.

But I don't wanna die!

Now I'm stuck in this awful
place, thinking about death

297
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:38,084
and doctors, and wondering: Why
couldn't I be something else?

298
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,003
Like a dentist.
Dentist would be nice.

299
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:42,088
Poke peoples teeth.
Make them feel better.

300

No giant sky sharks and
winged people trying to kill me.

At least I got my stick.

302
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:50,555
Wait. Maybe I've already died
and gone to Heaven.

to meet at ruins!

already here waiting for me!

306
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,522
Or maybe I was
so fast I beat them!

351
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:41,101
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

352
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:44,396
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

353
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:48,900
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

354
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,986
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

355
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

356
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,245
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

357
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

358
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:05,750
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

359
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,544
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

360
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,462
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

361
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,215
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

362
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:13,633
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

363
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

364
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:19,347
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

365
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,182
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

366
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,020
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

367
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:28,189
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

368
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:44,122
[NAMI]
I can't believe Sanji's dead.

369
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,374
[USOPP] Why am I stuck here with
you and the useless old man!

370
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,917
I can't count on either of you!

371
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,419
[NAMI]
Hey, that's my line.

372
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,379
[WYPER]
I'm taking you out, Straw Hats!

373
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,589
[LUFFY]
Excellent!

374
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,799
You mean for dinner?
What kinda place? Fancy?

375
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,302
[WYPER] Don't mock me,
you slithery pest!

376
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,054
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

377
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:03,350
"The Roaring Burn Bazooka!
Luffy vs. War Demon Wyper!"

378
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,935
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
