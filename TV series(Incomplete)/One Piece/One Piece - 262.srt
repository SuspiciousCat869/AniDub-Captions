1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,671
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:06,473
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,210
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,083
I am a proud
Captain of the Navy!

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,319
I shall not let you pass!

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,422
Be it wood or steel,
I'll slash your ship in two!

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,090
Good luck with that one.

8
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,492
We won't stop 'til
we reach our goal

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,195
and I will cut down
anything in our way!

10
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,001
En garde!

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,041
I hate crooked swordplay.

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,410
Right Angle Flying Bird.

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,147
Three-Sword Style Bull Demon!

14
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,222
Bone Phoenix!

15
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,531
He cut right through it!

16
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,032
Bold Hooves!

17
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,411
No way!

18
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,185
He beat T-Bone!

19
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,355
He must've come from
one of the loose cars.

20
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,557
Gotta hand it to him
it takes a lot of guts

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,760
to keep going in
a storm like this.

22
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,695
But still, that's
not enough to stop us.

23
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,267
I'm sure the burden of
justice is a heavy one

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,036
but we've a few some
burdens of our own.

25
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:47,774
Hiss!

26
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,578
You put on a big show,
but you're all bark and no bite!

27
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,120
Go go, go, go, go!

28
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,589
You people are pathetic!

29
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,558
Nico Robin has you eating
right out of her hand!

30
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,594
She's betrayed every
person she's ever met,

31
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,829
and you're here risking
your life to save her?

32
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,464
You're beyond help!

33
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,599
It's time to die!

34
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,203
Three-Spot Decoupage!

35
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,419
Instead of making excuses
why don't you tell me

36
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,590
what you want written on
your gravestone, brother.

37
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:42,128
Here's my Ultimate Hammer!

38
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,151
Wow, some entrance.

39
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,619
What the hell have
you been doing?

40
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,887
Ow!

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,757
Well, as per usual, I've been
kicking ass-and what about you?

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,491
Been kicking ass.

43
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,699
It's gotten so noisy
all of a sudden.

44
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,134
I take it all of the escorts

45
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,369
for this mission have
been annihilated then?

46
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,470
Well, we weren't expecting much

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,239
from them to begin with.

48
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,243
So it's you, huh?

49
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,512
You're the bastards
who kidnapped Robin.

50
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,713
Be careful.

51
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,748
They use some
pretty weird moves.

52
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:48,762
And who is this?

53
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,097
Based on what Corgy said,

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,466
he's probably that
new recruit for CP9.

55
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,768
Name's Nero, he's
gone through training,

56
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,337
knows four of the powers.

57
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,443
Dammit!

58
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,712
You're in for it now, you
bastard!

59
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,281
Nobody does that to me
and gets away with it!

60
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,517
I'll show you why they call
me the genius of fighting!

61
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,419
Now prepare to die!

62
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,154
Huh?

63
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,490
Hey new guy.

64
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,094
Let me guess,
you must be Rob Lucci.

65
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:22,529
Sorry I didn't introduce myself.

66
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,267
Just give me a moment and
I'll kill this troublemaker.

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,569
Our orders were to
bring him in alive.

68
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,206
You've let your emotions get
the better of you, it seems.

69
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,675
Well, that just won't do.

70
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:39,012
I'll give you three seconds
to run for your life.

71
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,681
Three.

72
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,116
Run for my life?!

73
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,083
Run from who?

74
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,351
Two.

75
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,352
What?!

76
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,687
Stop kidding around, okay?!

77
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,322
It's not funny!

78
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,090
And one.

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,259
No! Don't do it!

80
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:59,085
I'll give you three
seconds to run for your life.

81
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,288
Three.

82
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,389
Run for my life?!

83
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,557
Run from who?

84
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,092
Two.

85
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:05,826
What?!

86
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,528
Stop kidding around, okay?!

87
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,662
It's not funny!

88
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,264
And one.

89
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,067
No! Don't do it!

90
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,568
Shave!

91
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:35,089
You're nothing more than an
incompetent piece of trash.

92
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,124
You call yourself CP9?

93
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:39,292
Don't make me laugh.

94
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:53,107
You have to master all Six
Powers to be one of us, rookie.

95
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,741
Kalifa.

96
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,942
Yes?

97
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,213
On our official report, state:
"The new guy was too weak.

98
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,415
He was therefore
deemed worthless."

99
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,283
Understood.

100
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,123
And these are the
agents of justice?

101
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,591
Can't tell which
side is evil, huh?

102
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,770
Just like all the other
Government officials.

103
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,539
You have some
extremely bad manners.

104
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,474
Just doing my job.

105
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,579
A-ha! I knew it!

106
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,481
My intuitive sense of
smell has never let me down!

107
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,785
Enough of this nonsense.
Take off that cloak!

108
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:39,587
Do it! Do it!

109
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,322
Do it!

110
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:41,822
Dammit!

111
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,524
This is it!

112
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,258
Ha-haaa!

113
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,464
Wait!

114
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,765
Hold on!

115
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,300
My name is Sniper King.

116
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm the mysterious
hero from Sniper Island.

117
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,538
You got that?

118
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,106
Sniper King?

119
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,307
Let's settle down here!

120
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,776
You don't think you're gonna
get away with this, do you?!

121
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,378
Actually, I do!

122
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,713
You should never
underestimate a man

123
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,114
who is willing
to go the distance!

124
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,787
Lucci! Help!

125
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,164
I suppose there's no need to ask

126
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,768
what you're doing on
this train, intruder.

127
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,371
Judging by the way
you opened the door,

128
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,672
I know exactly the kind

129
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,674
of impatient people
we're dealing with.

130
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,608
Yeah.

131
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,077
Guess you'll have
to excuse my manners.

132
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,013
You've come to
rescue Nico Robin?

133
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,283
That is a mistake.

134
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,751
Oh?

135
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:44,885
Listen.

136
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,655
Her problem is one that's
beyond your comprehension.

137
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,190
You see, there are
some people in this world

138
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,593
who were just born
under a bad sign.

139
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:57,197
People who are, for the sake of
everyone else, better off dead.

140
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,300
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,201
For example.

142
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,340
Suppose there exists
a sleeping devil.

143
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:10,244
One that's capable of burning
the entire world to the ground.

144
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,745
And what if there was someone

145
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,480
with the ability
to wake that devil?

146
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:18,319
Even if this someone happened
to be an eight-year-old girl.

147
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,720
Don't you think
that for the lives

148
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,789
of every other living
being on this planet,

149
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,625
that girl should
be put to death?

150
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,461
Stop rambling and
get to the point.

151
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,764
What I just told you is the
true story of Nico Robin.

152
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,600
Her very first transgression.

153
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:36,303
And now, she's accumulated
an entire life of crime.

154
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,038
As far back as she can remember,

155
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,342
her very existence has
been nothing but a sin.

156
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,677
The only good she can
do this world would be

157
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,447
to forfeit her life
and disappear forever.

158
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,782
That's the misfortune
she carries with her.

159
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,883
She's cursed.

160
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:54,087
She has no choice but
to accept her fate and die.

161
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,791
Honestly, she should've
died over twenty years ago.

162
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,628
We're merely correcting
a wrong from the past.

163
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,497
It'll be better
for everyone else

164
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,100
when this is over
and she's dead.

165
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,601
Hey.

166
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,473
That's enough!

167
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,341
Bastard!

168
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,177
I don't wanna hear
another word out of you!

169
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,378
Pity.

170
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,514
Her death won't come nearly
as quickly as I would like.

171
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,388
Interrogations.

172
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,255
Torture.

173
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,223
Slowly.

174
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:30,457
Repeatedly.

175
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,093
The World Government is going
to keep her alive for years,

176
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,129
squeezing out all
of her knowledge,

177
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,164
experiences,
and intelligence.

178
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,332
She'll know agony
before she dies.

179
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,334
I'm not gonna let that happen!

180
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,435
Wait! Robin! Please!

181
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,270
Don't go in there!
No! Seriously!

182
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:48,309
That's a really, really,
really bad idea! Stop!

183
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,645
I said "Wait!"
not "Keep going!"

184
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,546
Robin!

185
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,148
There you are!

186
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,416
We're in deep trouble.

187
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,417
I'm so happy!

188
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,384
Are you okay?

189
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,385
Say something!

190
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,287
Why are you doing this?!

191
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,656
I went through all that trouble
to sneak in from the outside!

192
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,325
I even took out that
snoopy government guy!

193
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:08,729
So that's Nico Robin, huh?

194
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:09,930
I'd buy that.

195
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:14,768
Looks like the girl in the
wanted poster, that's for sure.

196
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,074
Lemme knock these guys
out then we'll escape!

197
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:24,345
We'll run away together and
leave all this behind us! 'Kay?

198
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,313
It's gonna be all right!

199
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,388
Usopp!

200
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,090
Robin! What are you doing?!

201
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,304
It seems that my words
mean nothing to you people.

202
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,196
Usopp!

203
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,698
Robin! What are you doing?!

204
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,079
It seems that my words
mean nothing to you people.

205
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,102
Franky! Quick!

206
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,439
Detach the third car!

207
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:01,041
Why? What are we gonna do?

208
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,678
Run.

209
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,545
We're gonna run?!

210
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,248
What the heck are
you talking about?

211
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,582
You too, Sanji!

212
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,282
Get ready!

213
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,385
This will be over in a flash!

214
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,254
Make sure that
Franky doesn't escape!

215
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,689
Right.

216
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:23,663
Sniper King Smoke Star!

217
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:33,107
What kind of a
stupid stunt is that?!

218
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,411
Come on!

219
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,345
I've got her!

220
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,080
Move it!

221
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,485
Put me down!

222
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,453
Let go!

223
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,658
All right!

224
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:53,260
Run!!!

225
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,264
Whoa!

226
00:14:57,297 --> 00:15:06,807
Turn back!

227
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,441
What was that?

228
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,576
He wants us to turn back?

229
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,110
Is that so?

230
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,113
Well that's certainly a relief.

231
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,381
Right.

232
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,483
I suppose we should get ready
to turn this thing around then.

233
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,218
Yep!

234
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,188
Huh?

235
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,357
What?!

236
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,259
But we've already come so far!

237
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,060
No way!

238
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,795
What about Robin
and Usopp, Zoro?!

239
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,463
What are we gonna do?!
What are we gonna do?!

240
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,164
What are we gonna do?!

241
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:30,831
About what?

242
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:32,066
That idiot!

243
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,634
What in the hell
is he thinking?!

244
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,735
Hey, Straw Hat!

245
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,503
Why do you wanna turn back?

246
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,805
Answer us!

247
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:39,240
Yeah, tell us why!

248
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,108
You better give us a reason!

249
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,211
That's not what I meant!

250
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,549
I was telling that
giant frog that jumped

251
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:49,650
on the railway to turn back!

252
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,685
He came out of nowhere!

253
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,120
Gero! Gero! Gero!

254
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,722
It's Yokozuna!

255
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,156
Yokozuna?

256
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,824
No way!

257
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:57,758
Look out!

258
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,560
A giant frog's on the tracks!

259
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,161
Froggy!

260
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,229
Turn back!

261
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:03,564
Get out of the way!

262
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:04,665
Gero!

263
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:08,134
Look out!

264
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:14,341
Yes!

265
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,509
We did it!

266
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,577
We got Robin back!

267
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,716
You know I should be happy.

268
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,786
But I'm not really a big fan
of this "running away" stuff.

269
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,554
That smoke screen
was such a stupid idea

270
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,656
that it actually surprised them.

271
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:32,726
Whew!

272
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,296
Sniper King says,
"The plan that involves us

273
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,799
not fighting scary guys like
them is the best plan of all."

274
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,600
Doubtful.

275
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,537
Besides, that was too easy.

276
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,572
Yeah.

277
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,307
These guys aren't
like the others.

278
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,475
We shouldn't let our
guard down just yet.

279
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,614
What's that?

280
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,020
Those thorny whips again?

281
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,691
I've got them.

282
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:04,825
Now, Blueno.

283
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,192
Right.

284
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,095
Quick! Cut those things!

285
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,772
They're pulling us back!!

286
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,007
Whoa, these guys are powerful!

287
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:27,447
Did you actually think a
smoke screen would stop us?

288
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,218
Like I said,
that was way too easy.

289
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,659
Now remember, don't kill
any of the Straw Hats.

290
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,128
That was our agreement.

291
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,229
Hey, Sniper King.

292
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:42,929
Yeah?

293
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,498
Protect Robin with your life!

294
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,366
Got it?

295
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:45,833
What?

296
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,834
Right!

297
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:52,005
I'm gonna have to ask
you to let our car go!

298
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,377
What the hell?

299
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,078
His body's like a rock!

300
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,548
I told you, these guys
use some weird moves!

301
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,724
Concasser!

302
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:22,069
Now that was a
pretty powerful kick.

303
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,105
It almost broke
through the Iron Body.

304
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:30,044
Careful, Blueno.

305
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,378
Don't take him lightly.

306
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,080
He doesn't have a bounty on him,

307
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,315
but he's one of
their main fighters.

308
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,321
That martial art style is crazy
but they're still going down.

309
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,589
Whoa! Robin!
Hold on a sec!

310
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,392
Wait! What are you doing?!

311
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,261
Now Ocho Fleurs!

312
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,463
With a Clutch!

313
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,631
Long nose! Look out!

314
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,537
Hey! Robin, what are you doing?!

315
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,275
Didn't you hear me?

316
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,376
Stay out of my business!

317
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:03,743
Leave me alone!

318
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,284
It can't be.

319
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,320
Hey! Buddy! You
should learn to pay attention.

320
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,029
Eyebrows!

321
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,567
You Straw Hats are nuts!

322
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,168
None of you make any damn sense!

323
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,302
All of you are so stubborn,

324
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,339
especially when it has anything
to do with your friends!

325
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,208
Well, we've come this far.

326
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,343
So, you want to escape, huh?

327
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:41,047
Then here's your big chance!

328
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,522
Franky!

329
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,240
That was uncalled for.

330
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:42,676
Didn't expect that, did ya?

331
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,612
I don't understand
your intentions.

332
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:47,081
Why side with them
in the first place?

333
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,782
I couldn't take it anymore.

334
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:49,916
No matter what she said or did,

335
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,320
those two idiots weren't
gonna leave here without her.

336
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,190
That still doesn't explain
why you're butting in on this.

337
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:56,724
Ow!

338
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,225
Hey, listen!

339
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:58,826
Get outta here!

340
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,094
Don't worry about me!

341
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:01,295
I've got a plan!

342
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,262
When you meet up with Straw Hat,

343
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:05,532
find some way to get
back to Water 7, okay?!

344
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,333
Franky!

345
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,234
Hold on!

346
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,369
I'm not trying to escape!

347
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,569
I won't run!

348
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,640
Robin, what's wrong with you?

349
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,674
Cut it out!

350
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,776
There's no point in
trying to pretend anymore!

351
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,444
We know, okay?

352
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:22,082
We know what you did and
we came here to rescue you!

353
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,049
It doesn't matter if they

354
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,252
"Buster Call" us to
the ends of the world,

355
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,654
we'll fight them and win!

356
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,689
There's no reason for
you to keep obeying them

357
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:31,057
and throw your life away!

358
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:37,598
You're wrong.

359
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,799
If there's a Buster Call.

360
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,474
You'll be obliterated.

361
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:15,129
Stop it!

362
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:16,096
Let her go!

363
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,598
Robin, say something!

364
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:19,733
Robin, you're hiding
something, aren't you?

365
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,769
That's fine, have it your way.

366
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:24,204
But remember, a pirate
can't leave their crew

367
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,273

So believe in him.

369
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,543

"The Judicial Island!
Full View of Enies Lobby!"

I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
