00:01:28.242 --> 00:01:30.013
[TEACH laughs]

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.784
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:34.422
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.396
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.137
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.377 --> 00:02:37.915
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.889
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:43.260
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:46.099
as the New World.

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:48.170
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:50.641
to ever chart these waters
and learn all the secrets

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:51.844
they held.

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:53.748
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.119
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:58.356
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.331
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:04.736
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:12.317
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:18.029
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:20.067
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.171
intending to destroy
a Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:23.239
in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.273 --> 00:03:25.477
However, plans changed
when Law was captured

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.047
by Doflamingo.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.285
Luffy has now snuck
into the Royal Palace

00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:32.893
to rescue his apprehended ally.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.896
Meanwhile, the former
enslaved toys,

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.067
who have become human again,
are seeking revenge

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:38.402
against Doflamingo.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.377
[DIAMANTE]
What do these goons want?

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.650
Get him!
He works for Doflamingo!

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.354
We're gonna break every
bone in your body!

00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:50.093
[TOY MAN H] Annihilate him
and then the factory!

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.099
[NARRATOR] The fighting
tournament came to a surprising

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.538
conclusion when the man
disguised as Lucy claimed

00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.744
victory and finally revealed
his true identity.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.784
Who are you?

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:03.386
Come out and say it already.

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:05.991
[SABO]
Me?

00:04:13.072 --> 00:04:15.444
The name is Sabo.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:18.518
We're members of the
Revolutionary Army.

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.222
Then the first Lucy is too?

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:24.328
No, but we're both enemies
of the World Government.

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:27.334
That man will be the King
of the Pirates someday.

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.471
His name is Straw Hat Luffy.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:31.342
A pirate?

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.881
Yup! And he's my brother.

00:04:33.915 --> 00:04:35.216
Surprised?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.160
[NARRATOR] At the palace, Luffy
finally confronts Doflamingo.

00:04:41.362 --> 00:04:44.302
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:47.007
I'm here to save you!

00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.378
Oh, good! You didn't die!

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:51.081
[GROUP yells]

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.657
--It's the wall guy!
--Pica!

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.560
What a way to go, huh?

00:04:56.594 --> 00:04:58.965
That was a surprise.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.701
Wait, Mingo is alive?!

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:05.177
I'm left in a
difficult position.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.619
I have no other choice but
to use "The Birdcage."

00:05:09.652 --> 00:05:10.955
The Birdcage?

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:16.098
[DOFLAMINGO]
You remember, don't you, Law?

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:24.181
[LUFFY]
"The Devil's Trap!

00:05:24.214 --> 00:05:26.519

[TOYS yelling]

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.128
[TOY MAN A]
Where's Doflamingo?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.169
[TOY MAN B]
Smash everything in your path!

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:38.142
[TOY MAN C] C' mon!
Let's tear that factory down!

00:05:41.683 --> 00:05:43.420
[SMILE OVERSEER D]
Think we should book it?

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.992
They're on a rampage
and headed straight here!

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:47.728
This is above my pay grade!

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.972
Well, lucky for us,

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:54.609
I don't think that they
can actually reach us

00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:55.878
without the key!

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.894
You know this factory
means everything

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:05.698
to the Young Master.

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:07.502
Even if the ceiling collapses,

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:09.104
there won't be a scratch
on this place since

00:06:09.137 --> 00:06:11.577
it's made of Sea Prism Stone.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.181
Besides, need I remind you?

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:16.352
[chuckling]

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.960

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:22.330
[TOYS yelling]

00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:28.678
[SMILE OVERSEER A] We've got two
of the top executives watching

00:06:28.711 --> 00:06:29.879
over it.

[TOYS yelling]

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.086

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.212
Trust me when I say, no one
can get through these two.

00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:39.686
Our impenetrable defenses
really are impenetrable!

00:07:56.152 --> 00:07:58.890
Well I suppose I shouldn't
delay this further.

00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.838
Shut your damn mouth!

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:15.558
How can you still
be alive, Doflamingo?

00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:17.227
[yells]

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:21.302
[DOFLAMINGO]
Do you want me to show you

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.608
how to properly behead a man?

00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:24.643
Soldier!

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:25.978
Kyros, behind you!

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:29.484
Just like this.

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:33.359
Kyros, no!

00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:44.381
Damn Straw Hat!

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:02.351
There's two Young Masters?

00:09:02.384 --> 00:09:05.089
Pentachromatic. Strings!

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:19.519
Sorry! My mistake!

00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:21.756
Hey, jerk! Gum-Gum...

But how? He has a double?

00:10:46.827 --> 00:10:48.062
That hurt!

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:53.707
It seems he's made a
marionette out of his strings!

00:10:58.316 --> 00:11:00.286
That technique. What is it?

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.226
Riku.

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:04.596
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:06.700
A quick question.

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.937
Do you remember how
you felt that evening,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.339
ten years ago?

00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:11.910
[DOLDO]
Mm...

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:14.916
The one where you
torched the town

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:17.588
and sliced your beloved
citizens to pieces?

00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:28.275
[DOLDO]
Please! I beg you! Stop!

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.883
If there's no way to prevent
me from hurting

00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:34.556
my own people...

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:37.227
...I'd rather be dead!

00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:41.368
Someone! Anyone!
Please! Kill me!

00:11:44.174 --> 00:11:47.180
I could never forget
such a tragedy.

00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:50.153
That nightmare haunts
me to this day!

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:52.691
Compared to what's
about to unfold,

00:11:52.725 --> 00:11:55.463
that will seem like
a sweet memory.

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:56.498
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:12:00.507 --> 00:12:02.444
[DOLDO] You're mad!
What are you planning?

00:12:02.478 --> 00:12:04.782
You cannot repeat
such a callous act!

00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:05.885
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hush, now.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:07.788
I'm going to release you all.

00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:08.823

00:12:10.093 --> 00:12:11.094
Pica.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.142
I think it's time you
scatter these roaches.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.644
Doflamingo!

00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:12.183
You have done enough
damage to these people!

Don't put them through any more!

[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:14:40.427 --> 00:14:42.396
[LUFFY] He chucked us
right out of the palace!

00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:48.108
There's no chance of us
getting near Doflamingo

00:14:48.142 --> 00:14:49.645
if Pica is with him.

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:01.536

[PIRATE B]
We're no match for Doflamingo,

00:15:59.117 --> 00:16:01.857

in lashing out at him!

Huh? Razors?

00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.513
Huh? Were these
bars always here?

00:16:17.754 --> 00:16:20.093
That's crazy! It sliced through?

00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:21.563
That should have worked!

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:22.965

as far as we can see.

Where's the exit?!

00:19:01.916 --> 00:19:03.587
[MARINE H]
Sir, Reporting in!

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.559
It's pandemonium
all across Dressrosa!

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:08.930
Everyone's going wild
and attacking one another!

00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:14.842
I'm sad to inform you
that there's even some

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:17.146
Marines attacking the civilians!

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:20.119
We need backup or many
innocent people will die!

00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:23.693
What going on now?

00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:31.809
[MARINE I] Th-The King's
Plateau... is sinking!

00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:39.458
[LUFFY]
H-Hey! Why's the ground shaky?

00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.127
Who's doing this?

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:42.396
It's Pica!

00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:50.680
He's changing the terrain
with his stone powers.

00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:56.358
[LUFFY] The Royal Palace
is running away!

00:19:56.391 --> 00:19:59.163
Stop! You get back here!

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.354
[TOYS yelling]

00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:17.166
[TOY MAN D]
Look out!

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.870
The factory is ascending!

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:21.307
[TOY MAN E]
What? How is that even possible?

00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:25.583
[TOWNSMAN G]
Help me!

00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:31.529
[TOWNSMAN H]
Please stop me!

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:37.374
[TOWNSMAN J]
Look at the Flower Field!

00:20:37.407 --> 00:20:40.714
It's rising up and
pulling the whole town

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:41.849
with it!

00:20:48.062 --> 00:20:50.499
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:18.823
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL]
Cu-lick.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.298
Citizens and guests
of Dressrosa.

00:21:23.332 --> 00:21:24.334
Greetings.

00:21:24.368 --> 00:21:25.970
Might I have a word?

00:21:27.139 --> 00:21:29.410
When I started my reign,
I could have easily

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:31.882
ruled over you
with an iron fist.

00:21:31.916 --> 00:21:34.054
Instead, I was benevolent.

00:21:34.087 --> 00:21:36.357
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:21:49.116 --> 00:21:51.522
But now that you know the truth,

00:21:51.555 --> 00:21:53.860
there's no doubt in
my mind that the vast

00:21:53.893 --> 00:21:57.601
majority of you would
like to see me dead.

00:21:57.635 --> 00:22:00.439
That's why I've prepared
a little game for you.

00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:08.021
Your objective is
to assassinate me.

00:22:08.055 --> 00:22:10.927
You can find me
in the Royal Palace.

00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:13.198
I won't be going anywhere.

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:16.037
Take my life, and the game ends.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.674
I die, you win.

00:22:17.708 --> 00:22:19.243
Real simple, right?

00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:22.651
And, since I'm so generous,

00:22:22.684 --> 00:22:26.024
I'll give you a second
way to win as well.

00:22:26.057 --> 00:22:28.295
I'm about to read
out a list of people,

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:30.567
so get your pencils ready.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.272
Should you manage to
bring me their dead bodies,

00:22:33.305 --> 00:22:34.374
you win!

00:22:34.407 --> 00:22:37.647
Also. I will award a
sizeable bounty for each

00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:39.651
and every head I receive.

00:22:41.823 --> 00:22:44.160
It's kill or be killed.

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:52.911
Every person in the kingdom
is now a bounty hunter.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.998
And the only way
for you to survive

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:05.703
is for you to take the life
of another person.

00:23:06.973 --> 00:23:08.542
[laughs]

00:23:14.855 --> 00:23:16.659
[NARRATOR] The all-out battle
at the Colosseum was

00:23:16.693 --> 00:23:18.028
just the beginning!

00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:20.733
Now, all of Dressrosa
has turned to chaos,

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:23.405
as a horrifying game of
life-or-death commences.

00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:25.476
Faced with a difficult
situation where the citizens

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.812
have turned against him,

00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:28.784
Luffy moves to take
down Doflamingo

00:23:28.817 --> 00:23:30.987
before it's too late!

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.725
[LUFFY]
On the next <i>One Piece</i>!

00:23:32.758 --> 00:23:36.799
"The 500 Million Berry Man!
Target: Usoland!"

00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:39.003
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
