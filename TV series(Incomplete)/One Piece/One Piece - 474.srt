1
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,523
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:39,193
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,894
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,897
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,332
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,068
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,903
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,839
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,676
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,211
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,879
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:03,250
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,552
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,822
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,025
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,863
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,936
[NARRATOR] Separated
from the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,071
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,039
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,475
Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates

21
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,810
are fighting hard to
reach the scaffold,

22
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:33,380
but the Navy has activated
the bay's encircling walls,

23
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,117
trapping the pirates
in a fiery ring of death.

24
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:45,125
[SENGOKU]
What's going on down there?

25
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,327
Why didn't the last wall raise?

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,163
Well, it's, uh, it's Oars' body.

27
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,266
The walls don't seem
strong enough to lift it, sir.

28
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,269
Also, it looks like his blood
is running into the system

29
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,804
and making it malfunction!

30
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,810
[ACE gasp]
Oars! You saved them.

31
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,779
We must be swift.

32
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,947
You know what to do, Akainu!

33
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,333
[LUFFY]
"Execution Order Issued!

34
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,002
Break Through
the Encircling Walls!"

35
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,077
[MAN AA] What's going on,
where's the picture?

36
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,378
[MAN BB]
We wanna see the war!

37
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,947
[MAN CC]
Hurry and get it fixed!

38
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,981
It looks like they're
having problems

39
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:42,950
with the video
transponder snails!

40
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,019
Maybe they got blown up in
the crossfire or something!

41
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,456
[MAN B] Is it true that
the Navy and Whitebeard

42
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,158
had some kind of
deal worked out?

43
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:56,429
[CROWD shouting]

44
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,366
[MAN DD] Did Whitebeard
really sell out his allies?

45
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,904
We all wanna know
how the war's gonna end!

46
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,076
Come on! The whole
world's at stake!

47
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,082
[CROWD continues shouting]

48
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:20,253
Just when I thought the Navy
couldn't sink any lower.

49
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,789
S'been nothin' but
a sideshow till now.

50
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,992
[ON-AIR PIRATE A] The only
reason we came back to Saobaody

51
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,160
was to watch the war.

52
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,262
Of course the
snail's malfunctioning.

53
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,163
Are you really buyin' that?

54
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,965
What? You mean you don't?

55
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,834
Course not.
What are you, stupid?

56
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,935
There's only one way the Navy

57
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,937
would allow that
feed to cut out.

58
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,073
They don't want the world to
see what they're about to do.

59
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,750
[BONNEY crying]

60
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,786
You okay, Captain Bonney?

61
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,254
Go away! Just shut up!

62
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,292
[LAW] Whitebeard sold out his
allies? What a load of crap.

63
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:02,763
The man's a living legend 'cause
all us pirates respect him.

64
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,998
Let's set sail, Bepo.

65
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,799
[BEPO]
Aye-aye, Captain!

66
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,401
[LAW]
You with us, Jean Bart?

67
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:08,769
Yes sir, you heard me right!

68
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,938
Seems like there's no chance
of recovering the signal!

69
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,140
I have no idea what's happening
at Marineford right now!

70
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,281
[AKAINU]
Meteor Volcano!

71

[yells]

73
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,063
They've got nowhere to run.

74
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,966
Now we'll melt that ice
and drown them all!

It's melting!

[PIRATES screaming]

82
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,923
It's so warm.

83
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,991
No, no! It's hot! I'm burning!

84
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,227
[PIRATE E]
The lava's boiling the sea!

[PIRATES groaning]

86
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,665
[PIRATE F]
Hurry and get on the ice!

Huh?

Ah! They're blocking us in here!

[PIRATES screaming]

93
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,554
We've gotta be able to take
down this wall somehow!

Ugh! Whitebeard!

100
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,585
How is it still standing
after a shot from Pops?

101
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,752
What is that thing made of?!

102
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,654
[WHITEBEARD growls]

103
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,790
All right. Let's hit 'em
where it really hurts.

[PIRATES screaming]

106
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,734
[PIRATE CC] That bastard aimed
straight for the Moby Dick!

107
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,870
We've gotta put out the fire!

108

[PIRATE DD]

[PIRATE EE]
We can't let her sink!

112
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,380
It just won't be the
same sailing with Ace

113
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,381
again without the Moby Dick!

114
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,319
Whitebeard, watch your
legacy go up in flames!

[PIRATE N]
The Moby Dick. It's-- It's gone.

118
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:38,278
No! Damn those monsters! That
ship was the only home we knew!

119
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:43,316
Damn it! Don't give up now!
The Moby Dick has been carrying

120
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,286
the Whitebeard Pirates
for decades!

121

[PIRATES gasping]

122
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:14,180
[WHITEBEARD]
I'm sorry, old friend.

123
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,752
[PIRATE HH]
We've gotta get to the plaza

124
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,588
before this gets any worse!

[ACE grunts]

126
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,594
Listen to that. What the heck do
you think is going on in there?

127
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,497
You don't even
need to see to know.

128
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,431
They can't advance,
they can't retreat,

129
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,501
and now they've got death
raining down on them from above.

130
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,236
Those steel encircling walls are

131
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,940
none other than the walls of
the Whitebeard Pirates' casket.

132
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,910
[COBY gasps]
Their casket?

133
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:47,280
[SENGOKU] The plan is working
perfectly, so we'll proceed.

134
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:51,218
Phase two is the
immediate execution

135
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,620
of Portgas D. Ace!

We gotta get up
there 'n stop 'em!

But how?
We're completely trapped!

142
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,643
No... There's still a way out.

143
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,479
Just look ahead and see.

144
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,548
The path that Oars made!

145
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,416
But that's like a death trap.

146
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,586
That's exactly where
the Navy's expecting us to go.

147
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,164
The more we think,
the more time we waste!

148
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,467
Yeah. It's the only
way we can save Ace,

149
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,634
even if it means our death.

They're running straight
into the line of fire!

[SENGOKU] Not yet! Let them
get as close as possible!

There's only one way in
and one way out,

00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,931
where else is the Navy
going to point their cannons?

We're picking them

I can see him.

[LUFFY panting]

198
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,268

200
00:14:28,636 --> 00:14:29,836

Straw Boy, no!

204
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,258
Luffy!

205
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:27,594
Luffy!

206
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:46,380
[MARINE BB] All right, fire on
any pirate who climbs up Oars!

207
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:50,951
[ACE gasping]

208
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,958
I'm still gonna save you!

[ACE gasping]

210
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,799

Prepare for the execution.

[MARINES]
Whoa!

00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,781

[MARINE CC]
How is Little Oars still alive?

224
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,170
Did nobody check his pulse?

225
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:21,274
Get away from Ace!

226
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,911
I'm gonna save you!

227
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,951
Ace... My friend.

228
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,387
O-Oars!

229
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,757
I won't die till you're safe.

230
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,894
Oars, no!

231
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,963
I'll be...

232
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,299
Oars Jr.'s still alive?

233
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,234
[PIRATES cheering]

234
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,103
Captain!

235
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,672
Now, that's a pirate.

236
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,774
Little Oars.

237
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,509
[PIRATE AG]
We're ready to follow, Captain.

238
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,110
[SQUARD gasps]

239
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,420
[SQUARD]
Huh?

240
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,758
Get back in the fight.

241
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,793
Even now?

242
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,935
[SQUARD]
I'm ready.

243
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,670
[LUFFY grunts, panting]

244
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,873
No more falling in
the sea, all right?

245
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,841
Honestly, you are too reckless!

246
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,745
[panting]

247
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,114
Prepare to open fire, men.

248
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,887
[SENGOKU]
Now!

249
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,289
[OARS JR. groaning]

250
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,058
Oars! Stop!

251
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,526
[OARS JR. groans]

252
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,894
They'll kill him
for real this time!

253
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,229
[PIRATES]
Oh, no!

254
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:54,334
[OARS JR. groaning]

255
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,104
Oars, please!

256
00:18:57,138 --> 00:19:00,841
We gotta do something.
And we gotta do it fast.

257
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,176
There's no time left.

258
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,512
They already issued
the order to kill Ace!

259
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:06,847
Yes, but we need a strategy.

260
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:09,883
[LUFFY]
Jimbei...

261
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,956
I need a favor from you.

262
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,527
[OARS JR. panting]

263
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,595
Ace!

264
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,931
Well, he's a tough one!

265
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,566
[MARINE DD] He's just
about dead! Keep shooting!

266
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,204
[KIZARU] Save your bullets,
boys. I'll finish him off.

267
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,905
Admiral!

268
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,941
[KIZARU] We've dealt
with enough setbacks.

269
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:37,778
We need to get this
execution on the road.

270
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,180
A head shot seems appropriate.

271
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:44,218
Quick, easy, and
100 percent effective.

272
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,386
[PIRATE FF]
Oars!

273
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,954
[PIRATE GG]
Run, Captain Oars!

274
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:50,724
[OARS JR. panting]

275
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,126
Please, no!

276
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,563
[KIZARU]
Say goodnight, big guy.

277
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,798

[ACE]
Luffy!

[LUFFY panting]

283
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,777
I see. So, you found a way up.

284
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,882
You've done quite well,
son of Dragon.

285
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,950
You're standing tall now.

286
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:29,789
Ahh, youth... So much fire!

287
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,764
That's Straw Hat Luffy who
got thrown over the wall,

288
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,700
A-Ace's brother!

289
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,901
Well done, brat.

290
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:45,872
[LUFFY panting]

291
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,844
I do respect your tenacity, kid,
but it's not enough.

292
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:52,579
That's right. It's a fluke
you got this far and

293
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,882
you're too green
to go any further.

294
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,751
Whatever gives you
the idea you can defeat us?

295
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:02,856
[LUFFY panting]

296
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:13,633
Back off!

297
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:18,439
You're not gonna kill Ace!

298
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,507
He and his brother
are two of a kind.

299
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,176
They just dive right in
without even thinking.

300
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,715
Oars! Stay put! I need
your help one more time!

301
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:28,915
Sure, Pops!

302
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,450
[WHITEBEARD]
Jozu, the trump card!

303
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:31,352
Yes, sir!

304
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:33,253
Get ready to move, everyone!

305
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:36,890
We're charging
straight into the plaza!

306
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,861
[LUFFY yelling]

307
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:46,733
Gum-Gum Stamp Gatling!

[LUFFY yelling]

310
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,697
[NARRATOR]
Luffy bursts into the plaza,

311
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,799
leading the assault
on the Navy forces.

312
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:21,235
However, the three
admirals block his path,

313
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,404
making victory all
but impossible.

314
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:26,507
Fortunately, Whitebeard has
one final trick up his sleeve,

315
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,010
if Luffy can survive long
enough to receive his aid.

316
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,745
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

317
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,914
"Moving into the Final Phase!

318
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,583
Whitebeard's Trump
Card for Recovery!"

319
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,219
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
