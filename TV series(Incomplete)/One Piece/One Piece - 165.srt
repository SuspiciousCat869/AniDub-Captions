00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,367
How'd you get rid
of that priest?

350
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,285
I used the whistle
the Sky Knight gave us

351
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,037
and he showed up to rescue me.

352
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,330
Oh. Where is he?

353
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,956
I don't see him.

354
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,124
[gasps]

355
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:26,763
He's willing to sacrifice
this much for us

356
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:30,183
even though he gave us
that whistle for free.

357
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,518
If it wasn't for the Sky Knight,

358
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,144
you guys probably
wouldn't have a ship

359
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:34,896
and I'd for sure be dead.

360
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,232
I got a bunch of
questions for him,

361
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,609
but I guess I'll wait
till he wakes up.

362
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,778
We owe you a thanks as well.

363
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,363
[PIERRE squawks]

364
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,790
Luffy!

365
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,961
The Going Merry's trashed
and it'll be dark soon,

366
00:18:58,044 --> 00:18:59,170
so there's no chance
we'll make it

367
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,756
back to Angel Island
until tomorrow.

368
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,925
[SANJI]
We should hop over to the land

369
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,844
and make camp on
shore for the night.

370
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,345
[LUFFY]
Hm? Why there?

371
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,305
Because if we stay here
and someone attacks us,

372
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:11,474
the first thing to take a
beating will be our ship.

373
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:13,810
Would you use your head, Luffy?

374
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,937
Not to mention it's
easier to fight from land

375
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,023
than from an altar
floating on a cloud.

376
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,192
[CHOPPER, LUFFY laughing]

377
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,402
Camping!

378
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:23,570
This isn't a party!

379
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:25,280
We're in enemy territory!

380
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,489
Now calm down!

381
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,366
[LUFFY]
Not a party. Got it.

382
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,661
Hey, Usopp, is a
barbecue a party?

383
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:46,926
These things are tasty!

384
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,596
[NAMI] You'd eat dirt if
we told you it was food.

385
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,389
Heh! You haven't even tried it.

386
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,099
What do you know?

387
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,351
Quiet down now!

388
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:57,187
It is time to hear
everyone's field reports.

389
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,272
We ran into this
priest named Satori

390
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,691
who uses spheres with
different kinds of threats

391
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,734
inside each one.

392
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:04,819
Explosives, dragons, the usual.

393
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,821
But what really hung us
out to dry in the fight

394
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,740
was that this guy kept
predicting our moves

395
00:20:08,823 --> 00:20:12,160
using a power called
Mantra or something.

396
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,162
The priest that attacked
me was named Shura

397
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:16,706
and he used a spear that
sets fire to anything.

398
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,166
He seemed like he could
predict my moves

399
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:19,501
just like that Satori guy.

400
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:23,046
And I tried and tried to
attack him, but, he...

401
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:24,923
He dodged me every single time.

402
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,925
Then the bird he was riding
burned down the mast

403
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,803
and the Sky Knight was defeated.

404
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:32,305
Sounds like you all
had a rough time.

405
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,933
Well, what we found is
that this island we're on

406
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,102
is actually the
missing part of Jaya.

407
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,979
You see, the City of Gold
didn't sink into the ocean.

408
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,315
It was shot into
the sky like us.

409
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,821
[USOPP]
Excellent work!

410
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,656
Now, based on your reports,

411
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:52,534
we've learned that the priests
can predict our movements

412
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,786
using a power they
like to call Mantra.

413
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,205
And the bird blows flames
and the spear burns you.

414
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:59,791
But most importantly
we've learned this:

415
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:02,377
The City of Gold is not a
thousand leagues under the sea

416
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,461
as we had thought, but it is

417
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,672
hidden somewhere
on this very island.

418
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:07,424
No way!

419
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,634
That was the first
thing I told you!

420
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:12,595
So, what is this Mantra
business all about?

421
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,724
Maybe it's some kind of sixth
sense you only get up here.

422
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,350
Sixth sense?

423
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:20,186
Yo, Chopper, do I need to
grind this down any more?

424
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,731
[CHOPPER] Yes. It needs
to be a fine powder.

425
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,276
He's suffered a lot of damage
to his digestive system.

426
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,364
[LUFFY chuckles]
This is it!

427
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:33,616
An adventure with
gold at the end!

428
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,119
I can't wait!

429
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:38,538
Glad to see someone
on my side. I'm ready.

430
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:39,789
Luffy, no.

431
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:41,541
Did you forget what that
scary guerilla guy said

432
00:21:41,624 --> 00:21:43,752
about execution?

433
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,212
God will be really mad.

434
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:49,424
[ROBIN chuckles]
Sounds like fun.

435
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,509
Well, we wouldn't be
very good pirates

436
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,303
if we turned our backs on gold.

437
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:54,721
So let's not.

438
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:56,014
It won't be easy.

439
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:59,184
You know everybody up
here already hates us.

440
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:00,727
Which means I'm in.

441
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,395
Come on.

442
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:06,649
Aren't you even a little
frightened of the wrath of God?

443
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,736
I mean, I wanna live! Don't you?

444
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,199
[LUFFY grunts]

445
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:18,244
[laughs]

446
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:19,245
Gold!

447
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,415
And it's all waitin' for us!

448
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:38,848
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

449
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:45,313
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

450
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,233
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

451
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,985
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

452
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,864
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

453
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:59,911
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

454
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,832
<i>We will never yield</i>

455
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,709
<i>We won't back down</i>

456
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:09,004
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

457
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

458
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,972
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

459
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,392
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

460
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:30,275
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

461
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,497
[NAMI] I can't wait to put
my eyes on that treasure!

462
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:45,707
[USOPP]
Slow down there, Nami.

463
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,459
We don't start until
tomorrow morning.

464
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,544
[LUFFY] Right! After we've
eaten a hardy breakfast!

465
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,129
[NAMI]
It's always food with you.

466
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,589
[USOPP] Isn't this gold in the
shape of a bell or something?

467
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,883
[NAMI]
A golden bell? How beautiful!

468
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,385
[LUFFY laughs]
That gold bell is ours!

469
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,553
[NAMI, USOPP]
Yeah!

470
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,180
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

471
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:02,557
"Festival on the Night
Before Gold-Hunting!

472
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,975
Feelings for Vearth!"

473
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,811
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
