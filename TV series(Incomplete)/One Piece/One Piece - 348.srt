Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,991
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,493
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,165
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,170
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,073
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,443
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,879
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,349
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,286
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,189
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,458
[HOGBACK] He is one of
my "Zombie Generals."

48
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,460
His body is quite special.

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,097
It hearkens from the country
of Wano in the New World.

50
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,237
Wait. What happened?

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,972
I thought he was
going to cut us.

52
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,407
Whatever, you guys! Come on!

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,442
Let's get out of here
while we still can!

54
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,044
Look, the door is wide open!

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:31,945

[LUFFY] Lemme go, you bastards!

61
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,466
Open up this box and let me out!

62
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,168
Is that a coffin?

63
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,403
[ROBIN] That voice.

64
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,005
What are you
doing in that box, dumbass?

65
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,341
Why'd you go and get
yourself caught like that?

00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,109

wedding ceremony immediately.

All the preparations
have already been made.

00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,982
You're that
invisible pervert from the

00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,150
Let me go!

[ABSALOM]
You may call me Absalom.

73
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,291
It's the name of your future
husband, so remember it well!

74
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,459
[NAMI] I don't keep
myself in shape

75
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,095
so some sick voyeur
can drool over me!

76
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,298
So don't treat me like a
piece of meat, you animal!

77
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,938
[USOPP] We gotta get
out of this forest!

Ah-ah-ah-ah!

Coup de Vent!

00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,663
[TARARAN] You can't break
the friggin' bridge, man!

85
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,964
That's cheating!

00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,411
but at least they're trapped
in the courtyard for now.

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,582
Aaaaaaah!

[RANDOM ZOMBIE GENERAL 347A]
You guys see that?

92
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,221
[BROOK] What do you
call a flying skeleton?

93
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,325

[USOPP] Oh, come on.

You... You mean it?

Of course I do!

[LOLA] To be completely honest,

00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,354
I was beginning to lose hope.

It's okay.

You don't have to
thank me for saying that.

[LOLA] I, like,

00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,286
I always tell him
how much I love him

00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,721
and I hug him so tight
I nearly crack his ribs!

135
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,324
And he's just like,
"oh whatever" about it.

as sweet as I can,

Well of course not, Lola!

You're going about
this all the wrong way!

Is that the problem?

00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,404
I'll put it this way.

to sign while he's sleeping!

Wait, is that really ethical?

147
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,313
I mean, like, as a human being?

00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,948
You gave me the
courage to fight!

178
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,720
Absalom, I'm coming for you!

179
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,791
Aaaaah! Lola?

180
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,394
All right you two,
this is our chance!

181
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,796
A non-violent
solution--for us at least.

182
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,332
Wow, Nami, that was awesome!

183
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,800
[NAMI] She's not
such a bad girl.

184
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,569
You just have to get
to know her a bit!

185
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,436
I know what you're thinking--

186
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,030
I can see it in your eyes!

187
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:47,637
[GYORO] Master, we're back!

188
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:51,307
We've done it! We've done it!

189
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,675
[LUFFY] Shut up about
your stupid master

190
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,809
and let me outta here!

191
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,879
I can't see anything!
Where am I?

192
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,814
Stop ignoring me!

193
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,652
[LUFFY] Who are you guys?

194
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,354
Hey! Lemme go! Stop! Stop it!

195
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,825
[LUFFY] You're lucky
I'm in here,

196
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,529
'cause when I get out,
I'm kicking your asses!

197
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:15,665
Little jerks!

198
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,700
What do these
things want from me?

199
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:35,951
[PERONA] What kind
of stupid pirate ship

200
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,853
doesn't have any treasure?

201
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,422
[ZOMBIE 348A] They have
a few chests and such,

202
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:40,623
but all of them are empty.

203
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,592
We did pick up some money
they had lying around at least.

204
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,528
[PERONA] What a waste of time.

205
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,862
I have to look at
your un-cute faces

206
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,698
and there's not even treasure?

207
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,566
I thought this was the
guy who beat Crocodile--

208
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,868
you'd think he'd have a
bit more to show for it!

209
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,038
[sighs] Whatever.
They've got plenty of food.

210
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:57,773
Let's take that back
with us at least.

211
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:58,941
[ZOMBIE 348A] Aye-aye!

212
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,609
[HILDON] Mistress Perona!

213
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,545
Hm? Hildon.

214
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,547
[HILDON] The Master
is calling for a meeting

215
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,115
with the Mysterious Three.

216
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:08,751
What is that about?
Did something bad happen?

217
00:11:08,784 --> 00:11:10,453
It would appear
that Straw Hat Luffy

218
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:11,787
has just been captured.

219
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,390
This will be the
debut of number 900!

220
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,426
Number 900? For real?

221
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,634
You sure are fat.
What the heck do you eat?

222
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:26,569
How rude of you!

223
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,071
You can't speak to
our master like that!

224
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:33,008
So, this is the famous
Straw Hat Luffy, huh?

225
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,953
Well, you're energetic
if nothing else.

226
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:47,022
Kushishishishi!

227
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,162
[LUFFY] And you must be Moria.
I hear you're a real jerk.

228
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,764
Kushishishishi!

229
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,133
I gotta admit,
I admire your confidence!

230
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,101
I'd expect nothing
less from a man

231
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,604
with a bounty of 300 million.

232
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,806
You'll make an
outstanding underling.

233
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,108
You're just perfect
for what I had in mind!

234
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,843
[LUFFY] Underling? Screw that!

235
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,211
Who do you think you are?

236
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,013
Who do I think I am?

237
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:14,049
Are you asking
me that ironically?

238
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:17,453
Kushishishishi!

239
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,788
It's obvious!

240
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,691
I am the man who will
become King of the Pirates!

241
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,206
Aaaauuughh! Master Ab!

242
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,476
Get out here and marry me
right now, you big jerk!

243
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,646
You turned invisible and
ditched me again, didn't you?

244
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:55,991
Did we lose them?

245
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,195
I think. Lola should
keep him busy.

246
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:02,665
It's him.

247
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,035
Guys, he's coming this way,
what should we do?

248
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,670
[USOPP] Over here!

249
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,543
Hurry! Get inside!

250
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:15,845
[NAMI] What the heck is that?

251
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,047
[USOPP] I don't know,
just get in here and hide!

252
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,022
[KUMACY] What was that?

253
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,861
This is strange.

254
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,763
There shouldn't be any
place left for them to run.

255
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,808
[ABSALOM] Hey! Kumacy!

256
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,642
[KUMACY] Perv-salom.

257
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,045
I mean, Master Absalom,
this is bad!

258
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,747
It seems intruders have--

259
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,616
[ABSALOM] Hold on,
this is important.

260
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,218
Did you see three
pirates run past here?

261
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,720
They just disappeared.

262
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,055
[KUMACY] Well, actually,
that's the thing--

263
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,791
[PERONA] Absalom!
What do you want?

264
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,094
I told you, I don't
like you in my room!

265
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,662
[ABSALOM] Perona.

266
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:08,330
[KUMACY] Welcome back,
Mistress Perona.

267
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:09,732
Is there anything you need?

268
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,966
[PERONA] Yeah,
I need you to stop talking!

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,635
How many times do
I have to tell you that?

270
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,070
[KUMACY] All right, but just
this once, there's something--

271
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,273
Can it. Nobody cares!

272
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:20,075
Don't you think you're being
a bit too strict with Kumacy?

273
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:22,011
Or rather, way too strict?

274
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,647
[PERONA] He's my underling,
what's it to you?

275
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,348
[PERONA] Anyway, did you hear?

276
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,084
Master is calling for us.

277
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:30,786
[ABSALOM] Did something happen?

278
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,321
[PERONA] I suppose
you could say that.

279
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,190
Number 900 is
making its big debut.

280
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:36,358
[ABSALOM] Number 900?

281
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:39,094
Then he must have
found a powerful shadow.

282
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:39,995
I wonder who--

283
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:41,096
[PERONA] It's Straw Hat Luffy...

284
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,866
[NAMI] It's a miracle
they haven't found us yet!

285
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,001
What were you thinking,
hiding in here?

286
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,937
We were better off before!

287
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:49,271
[USOPP] What do
you want from me?

288
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,006
You were freaking out
about that invisible guy

289
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,942
and I found something
to climb inside.

290
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,778
How was I supposed to
know it was a zombie, huh?

291
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,714
We'll run away as soon as
we get the chance, okay?

292
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:02,051
[HILDON] Master Absalom!
That's where you're hiding!

293
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,219
There's something important
I needed to tell you!

294
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,621
[ABSALOM] Yes?

295
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,622
[HILDON] In addition
to the pirates,

296
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,191
I'm afraid that we have
another unwanted guest.

297
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,960
[ABSALOM] Go on then.

298
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,829
It's him!
The Humming Swordsman!

299
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,297
He's back?

300
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,640
Did someone
just fall from the sky?

301
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,013
Hey. Is that what
I think it is down there?

302
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,848
It can't be.

303
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,149
[FRANKY] Actually,
looking at the shape,

304
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,269
I don't think it
could be anything else.

305
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:04,013
I don't get it.

306
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,349
Just where did that weirdo
fall down from, anyway?

307
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,059
Guess we better go save him.

308
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,293
What a pain in the ass.

309
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,143
Hey, hey!
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

310
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,577
You think I'm
gonna let you get away,

311
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,480
just cause you broke
some measly bridge?

312
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,982
I'm a spider!

313
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:42,151
I can climb wherever
the hell I want!

314
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,353
Monkey! Monkey!

315
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:45,320
Looks like we're gonna have

316
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,023
to pound the crap
outta this guy first.

317
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:52,261
You think you could
keep the spider busy for a sec?

318
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,328
[ROBIN] What for?

319
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:56,065
Perfect. There's an open
section right over there.

320
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,334
Anyway, I'm gonna
build a spider smasher.

321
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,072
Hey, I'm right here,
don't ignore me!

322
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,108
I'll show you
what's what! Bastards!

323
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,579
[TARARAN] Sticky Spider Net!

324
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,516
[ROBIN] He has a
spinneret on his hand.

325
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,418
Time for Seis Fleur.

326
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,223
[ROBIN] Slap.

327
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,961
You slapped my eye,
you awful woman!

328
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,529
No! No! Damn it!

329
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:30,299
You're playing dirty,
this isn't fair!

330
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,935
[FRANKY] Good work partner.

331
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,471
I'm ready to rock. Step aside.

332
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,139
[ROBIN] Hm? My! What's that?

333
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,107
[FRANKY] This here?

334
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,575
I just stuck my steel nunchucks

335
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,411
into some stone
columns, that's all.

336
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,985
'Cause when
a monster is this big,

337
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,222
you gotta smash him extra hard!

338
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,558
Heavy Nunchuck!

339
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,066
[TARARAN] Where did all
that power come from?

340
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,635
There's no way
this guy is human!

341
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,265
[RANDOM ZOMBIE GENERAL 348A]
Tararan's not looking so good.

342
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:37,466
[RANDOM ZOMBIE GENERAL 348B]
Who are these guys?

343
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:39,501
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 348B] At any
rate, we'd better go help him.

344
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,969
Come on.

345
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,442
I said stop it already!

346
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:50,279
[TARARAN] Sticky Spider Net!

347
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,486
[TARARAN]
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

348
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,621
No more smashing
me in the face!

349
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:04,193
Too bad for you! Looks
like it's time for revenge!

350
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,665
[FRANKY] Weapons Left!

351
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,142
[ROBIN grunts]

352
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:30,519
[FRANKY] Nico Robin!
What the hell are those things?

353
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:34,990
Mousey mousey mouse mouse!
Mousey mousey mouse mouse!

354
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:37,359
I was careless. I'm sorry.

355
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:40,162
I didn't think there'd
be other spiders here.

356
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,005
[FRANKY] Damn it.

357
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:53,709
[TARARAN]
Ah-ah-ah...

358
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:56,178
Serves you right.

359
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,547
Monkey! Monkey!

360
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,618
That's what happens when
you let your guard down!

361
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,419
These guys
are my minions.

362
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,121
They're called Spider Mice.

363
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:10,192
There's more than 500 of
them here on Thriller Bark!

364
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,195
Once we set our eyes on you,
there's no escape!

365
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,098
We've never once failed
to capture our prey!

366
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,700
From the shadows,
from your blindspot,

367
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,703
from where you least
expect it, we attack!

368
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,773
And thanks to
Dr. Hogback's modifications,

369
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,309
our silk webs are unbreakable!

370
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,278
We picked off your
friends one by one,

371
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,713
silently carrying them through
the ceiling of the mansion

372
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:34,383
without anyone
noticing a single thing!

373
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,051
It doesn't matter
how strong they are,

374
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:38,553
once they're wrapped in
our webs, they're helpless.

375
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,322
One little mistake
and they become nothing

376
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,091
more than another
offering to our Master!

377
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,593
Don't worry about your friends.

378
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,496
As soon as we carry you off,
you'll all be reunited!

379
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:50,232
Hope you enjoy the ride!

380
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,670
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

My goodness, it looks like you
came to this island after all.

399
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:21,890
[ROBIN] How did you
get all the way up here?

400
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,893
I jumped, of course.
I'm quite light.

401
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,894
Since you're here already,

402
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,730
I suppose there's
no point in holding back.

403
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,666
I'll tell you everything
I know about this island.

404

Who are you?

405
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,170
Huh? You're not a zombie!

406
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:37,572
Does that mean you're
with these pirates?

407
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,541
Hold on. What're you--

408
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,276
[BROOK] Worry not, my friend.

00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:46,415
