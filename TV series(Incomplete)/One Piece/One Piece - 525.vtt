WEBVTT

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.804
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.807
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.543
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.912
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.147
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.248
You can have it!

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.984
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.353
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:22.322
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:26.359
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.791
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.728
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:46.933
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.068
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.739
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:54.641
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:57.010
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.679
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.317
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.952
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.622
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:13.793
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.598
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.667
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.868
Scattered across the world,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.870
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.538
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.540
Now, thousands of feet
below sea level,

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.709
they set sail to the next
step of their journey:

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.144
Fishman Island.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:32.979
Only by passing
through its waters

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:35.381
may they reach the New World.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.985
There! Perfect!

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.055
That contraption is called
the Flutter Kick Coating!

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:44.824
It's an extravehicular
diving suit.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:48.461
[NAMI] Wait a sec! You guys
forgot the safety ropes!

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.896
[BOTH scream]

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.398
[SURUME roars]

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:55.268
Rocket Launcher!

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.605
[USOPP]
Not another one!

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.474
Guard Point!

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.076
Everyone okay?

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.815
[gasps] Now, Mil Fleurs!

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.050
Gigantesco Mano!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.120
[ALL screaming]

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.359
Everybody did great!

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:22.128
Now, guess it's my turn!

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:29.902
[LUFFY] "Lost in the Deep Sea!
The Straw Hats Get Separated!"

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.274
[LUFFY]
Now, Third Gear!

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.894
Armament Hardening!

00:04:57.897 --> 00:04:59.365
What the hell is that?

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.567
It must be a new move!

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.939
So tough underwater.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.341
Come on!

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:11.577
Aw, crap!

00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:14.047
Doesn't look like that octopus
is gonna wait patiently.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.049
Blue Walk!

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:19.218
Oh, my. Sanji just
left his bubble!

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.220
He's fast even in the sea!

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.257
Like a Fishman! So cool!

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.395
[SANJI] I spent two years
running from those monsters

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.130
on that island.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:35.068
And the first thing I do is
run straight at another one.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.971
But all things considered,
this one's a bit cuter, really.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.140
Diable Jambe!

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.283
Bien Cuit... Grill Shoot!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:58.124
[roars]

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.663
[SANJI] Can't hold my
breath much longer!

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:23.316
Three-Sword Style...
Crossing the Six Paths!

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.161
I thought this thing
was supposed to be

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.662
some kinda legend.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:38.164
Pathetic!

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:42.568
[ZORO] All I've done is fight
these last few years.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.404
It sounds awful
when I think about it,

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:46.806
but I'm actually
grateful for it.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.909
But I still haven't
surpassed him yet.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:53.179
And that's why...
I'll keep getting stronger.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:54.714
Uh, wow.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.983
[gasps] I couldn't
even see his attack!

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.485
Ugh. I coulda handled
that on my own.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:02.088
You say somethin', number seven?

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.823
I will kill you dead.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:04.924
You can try.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:07.393
Hey, were you two
not listenin' to me?!

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.896
I told you not to cut it!

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:14.167
My turn! Gum-Gum...

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.069
...Elephant Gun!

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:26.012
[yelling]

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:26.679
[grunts]

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.414
He blew it away!

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:29.415
[NAMI gasps]

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.617
What kind of training did
Luffy go through?

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.053
He did it underwater, no less!

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.293
[CHOPPER]
Hm? What the--?

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.294
You guys see that?

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.095
[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.831
[NAMI]
It's a shark.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:51.237
Huh.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.473
Yeah, why is that
shark wearing a shirt?

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:55.341
Not to mention it's huge.

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.915
[LUFFY]
What's it doin'?

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.384
[ZORO] Thanking us
for helping it, maybe?

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:07.753
[SANJI]
Nice manners for a fish, huh?

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:15.495
What's up?

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.231
The sea current
is pulling us in.

00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:20.766
That's not good.
Let's get back to Sunny!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.934
Yeah!

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.976
[LUFFY yelling]

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:37.016
They're being swept away
by the downward current!

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.585
[USOPP] We can't get split
up down here! Follow them!

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.620
[FRANKY]
Right!

00:08:40.653 --> 00:08:43.923
[STRAW HATS screaming]

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.526
[CHOPPER] I don't wanna die
down here! It's dark and wet!

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.094
[CARIBOU] Would you fools
pull it together?!

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:48.995
[FRANKY]
Forgot that dude was here.

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:50.329
Why aren't you panicking?!

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.697
[CHOPPER screaming]

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.965
[BROOK]
If I had a stomach,

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.635
I would be voiding its
contents right now!

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.207
Keep the yard level, Franky!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.642
Turn hard to port!

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.011
Otherwise we're gonna crash!

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:06.946
All right, I'm on it!

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:10.016
[NAMI] Don't let up for a
second or the ship's a goner!

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.587
Let's keep it
together, everybody!

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:17.957
Stay in the center
of the current!

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.825
Doin' my best!

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.973
[FRANKY]
It's way too fast!

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.541
[LUFFY laughs]

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:37.410
This is awesome!

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:46.519
[laughing]

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.097
You're awake.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.666
Ah! What a headache!

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.034
[USOPP sighs]

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.203
But at least we made it.

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:05.271
Hm?

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.213
What's wrong? Why're you
all making such long faces?

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:17.984
I mean, I'm awake now, so
there's nothing for you to fear!

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.687
[USOPP]
Man, is it freezing!

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:24.423
Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji
have gone missing.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.858
They're lost in the sea.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:26.826
[USOPP]
What?

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:29.261
The most we can do now
is hope the monster

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.030
didn't tear them apart.

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:33.232
[USOPP]
Glad you're being optimistic.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.406
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.322
[USOPP] How are we
supposed to find them

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:58.591
when we can't even see
what's in front of us?

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.893
[BROOK]
I don't like being in the dark.

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:04.397
It feels like something could
attack us from any direction.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.165
[FRANKY] The best I can
guess is we've descended

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.234
about 7,000 meters.

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:11.404
Even the Shark Submerge can't
sustain this level of pressure.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:13.739
[CHOPPER] How close are
we to Fishman Island?

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.575
Maybe the others have
already made it there!

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.910
[ROBIN]
Probably not.

00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:21.947
According to Camie, it's
10,000 meters below sea level.

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.750
[CHOPPER]
And we have 3,000 more to go?

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.353
Those guys each have
a bubble and that's all!

00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:29.588
Even if they are
somehow still alive,

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.323
they'll need more air!

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:33.993
None of this would've happened
if they used the safety ropes!

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:36.095
Freakin' out's not helping.

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:37.463
So let's get to work.

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.298
We can look for 'em
with my new searchlight.

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.733
Whoa!

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.470
Does it shine from your eyes?

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:46.105
You'll see.

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:46.872
[gasps]

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:48.340
[chuckles]

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.676
[FRANKY]
Franky Nipple Lights!

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.812
Why did they have to be there?

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:56.782
[gasps] Oh, wow.

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.184
So huge!

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:00.252
Scary!

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.622
[gasping]

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:04.623
[whimpers]

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:05.458
No.

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.493
Ah! There's no way!

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:09.695
[STRAW HATS screaming]

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.831
[FRANKY]
Let's get outta here!

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:20.473
[FRANKY] All right, everybody,
keep your eyes peeled.

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:21.974
They gotta be lookin' for us.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.376
With any luck,
we'll find each other.

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:30.816
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.552
Where in the world
have you guys gone?

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.721
We need you all back!

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.857
[BROOK] Come out, come out
wherever you are!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.392
Any time now! Really!

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.896
Damn it all!

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.699
This place is so vast,
and we're so far down,

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:49.001
Sunny's Eyes are
practically useless.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.737
[BROOK]
I feel so helpless.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.272
We can barely see.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.775
It's no wonder that
everyone is on edge.

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.344
There's gotta be a better
way to tackle this.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:13:00.946
You ladies got any ideas?

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.115
Keep searching and
just hope for the best.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.317
We can't stop the
ship right now.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:09.789
Surely they haven't
gone too far yet.

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:11.357
We can't give up on them.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.558
[OTHERS]
Right.

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.863
[CHOPPER]
Uh! Look, a jellyfish!

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:19.532
It's like we're inside it!

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:23.702
It's huge! It feels like
it could swallow us whole!

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:25.237
And they're twinkling!

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.240
It's like a starry sky,
wherever they go!

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:31.043
[gasps] They're so beautiful!

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:33.479
Whoa. That's one long tentacle.

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.981
You, uh, wanna shake
hands and be friends?

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.917
[ROBIN]
Whatever you do, don't touch it!

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.418
It's probably venomous!

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:40.920
[screams]

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.325
Aw, crap!

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:49.528
No choice! Coup de Burst!

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.233
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
No way!

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:56.335
It ate that big jellyfish whole!

00:13:56.368 --> 00:14:00.306
Uh. Not to mention, we lost
some air in that maneuver.

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.141
[FRANKY] It was better
than the alternative!

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:03.108
[ALL]
Huh?

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.310
But, yeah.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.146
The Coup de Burst sucks in
air to make a quick launch.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.248
Thing is, 'cause
we're underwater,

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.017
its only resource
is our air supply.

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.921
So obviously, when we use it,
our bubble shrinks a bit.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:17.756
[BROOK]
That makes sense.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.091
But it doesn't make
me feel better

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:21.160
about our coating deflating.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.798
[screams]

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:28.300
The fish that attacked it
turned upside down!

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:30.135
[ROBIN] A neurotoxin.
I figured as much.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.136
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Huh?!

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.341
It's awful down here!
And dark! It's scary!

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:40.346
All these creepy creatures
with their freaky eyes!

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.570
Because the sea's so dark,

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:08.173
many of the animals that live
down here have poor eyesight.

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:09.775
[CHOPPER, USOPP sigh]

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.444
[CHOPPER] So they can't
see any better than us.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.682
Hey! Losers! Where ya lookin'?

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.117
[ROBIN] However, there
are some that have

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.885
very developed eyes as well.

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.354
[CHOPPER, USOPP screaming]

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:26.725
Oh? You're curious as to how I
can see when I don't have eyes?

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:27.960
Of course you are.

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:30.262
But do you really want
to know the answer?

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:35.234
[BROOK laughs]

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:36.902
Drum roll!

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.705
[imitates drumming]

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:41.407
It's a secret!

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.877
Hey, Brook. Why is it you're
always talkin' to yourself?

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.747
It's a habit that comes
from being lonely.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.450
Enough! Quit fooling around!

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:52.117
--[thud]
--[BROOK grunts]

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:52.818
--[thud]
--[USOPP grunts]

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:54.086
--[thud]
--[CHOPPER grunts]

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.088
No more violence, please.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:03.395
[BOTH] Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!
Help us. Nami is scary.

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.497
[BROOK]
What's this?

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:07.466
Well, that's not good.

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.001
Hey, guys?

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.336
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:13.405
[BROOK] Have any of you seen
the pirate who boarded the ship?

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.407
[FRANKY]
Oh, yeah, I forgot about him.

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:17.843
I'm sure he's around
here somewhere.

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.278
[CHOPPER]
But where is somewhere?

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.414
I haven't seen him for a while.
Not since we descended.

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:24.083
[CHOPPER] Do you think he
might've been thrown off

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.584
when everything went crazy?

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:28.654
Totally possible. I mean,
his arms and legs were tied up.

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.255
There's no way he could
hold on to anything

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.657
while we were rockin' around.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.093
[BROOK]
Normally, I'd agree.

00:16:34.126 --> 00:16:36.762
But it seems that he
freed himself. Look.

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:37.463
[CHOPPER, USOPP]
Huh?!

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.498
[chuckles]

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:44.203
[USOPP] So that drippy weirdo
escaped and he's... still here.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.939
He's gotta be waiting us out
for a moment to attack.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:49.375
[screams]

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:50.342
This is bad.

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:51.343
[chuckles]

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.978
[CARIBOU]
If you're so eager to see me,

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:56.415
I'd be happy to sneak into your
room tonight, sweetheart.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.953
Damn it! We got enough problems.

00:17:00.986 --> 00:17:03.822
We don't need this guy givin' us
one more thing to worry about!

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.324
Don't get worked up.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:08.160
It's not like he's an actual
threat to any of us.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:14.066
[chuckles]

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.468
[CARIBOU]
That's right, you think that.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:19.238
You'll see how wrong you are
now that the three morons

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:22.374
who could put up a fight have
gotten themselves killed

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:25.577
fighting that kraken.

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.880
After all, there's no
way they've survived

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.082
getting sucked down into
the bowels of the ocean

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:32.918
with just those tiny bubbles
to protect them.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.353
[FRANKY]
Uh?

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:43.395
[CARIBOU] Oh, what a shame
that I didn't have the chance

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:46.031
to kill Straw Hat
with my own hands.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:48.067
But no one will ever
doubt that he's dead

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.936
once I come back with the rest
of his crew members' heads

00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:53.505
in tow as my personal trophies.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:54.706
No one at all.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.176
[CAIRBOU laughs]

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.511
[CARIBOU] Mhm. But I
can't get too excited.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:01.113
There's no need to rush.

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:02.514
If I killed them all now,

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.783
there wouldn't be anyone
left to sail the ship,

00:18:04.817 --> 00:18:06.418
and then what would I do?

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:08.087
So I'll let them live for now,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.522
while they can still
be useful to me.

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:13.058
Once we land on Fishman
Island, though,

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.361
I'm gonna slaughter you
down to the last man.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.730
[CARIBOU laughs]

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:38.150
[FRANKY]
I found him, guys!

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:40.385
[CARIBOU]
Hey! Knock it off, dammit!

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.888
I wasn't doing
anything bad, I swear!

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:44.456
Let's see him break outta that.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.059
How did he even manage
to get in there?

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.161
Because we weren't
paying attention to him.

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:51.930
If he weren't so stupid,
we could've been in trouble.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.299
His body was like a big
mass of goo in there.

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.634
It didn't have a real shape.

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.169
So he was like a pile of mud?

00:18:57.202 --> 00:19:00.305
[FRANKY] Yeah, if I had to
guess, it's a Devil Fruit power.

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:02.975
Most likely a Logia-Type
fruit at that.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:05.177
He was giving us a false
sense of security,

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.146
'cause he could've
escaped at any time.

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.982
[CARIBOU] Get me outta here!
I'll behave, I swear!

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:11.416
You, in the banana hammock!

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.986
If you let me out,
I'll be your servant!

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.354
Come on!

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:22.094
Hm? You feelin' all
right, Chopper?

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:25.664
I dunno. It just
got really hot.

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:29.268
I can't stand the
heat. I'm dying.

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:31.770
Sheesh! It is warmer!

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:34.640
Uh! Wait a second.
Is that smoke?

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.975
We can't see what's in
front of us through that!

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.613
Smoke underwater? Can't be.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:44.183
Actually, it can.

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.484
Is that--?

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.558
Hydrothermal deposits!

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.492
What?

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:56.061
Keep up! This is
a volcanic area!

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.029
For real?

00:19:57.062 --> 00:19:58.363
[NAMI]
Yes, for real!

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.499
You can see where
there've been eruptions!

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.367
[FRANKY]
We have to get outta here, now!

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:05.504
If one of those erupts,
we're as good as dead!

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:08.507
It's hot. I'm so hot.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.011
[CHOPPER] There's something
coming after us!

00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.846
It's carnivorous tubeworms!

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.148
Got no choice.

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.951
Small one. Coup de Burst!

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.554
[BOTH scream]

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:24.823
[BROOK]
Faceless crabs!

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.092
[FRANKY] Have to risk it
again. Coup de Burst!

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:28.527
[ALL scream]

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.596
[USOPP] I don't even know what
the hell those things are!

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:33.565
Hang on, guys! Coup de Burst!

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.368
[CHOPPER]
The sea is awful! I hate it!

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:40.706
There's no way the others can
survive down here on their own.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:42.507
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.443
And we'd only just
gotten back together.

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:48.046
Stop crying! Those three
are way too tough to die!

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.949
Even using the Coup de
Burst that sparingly,

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:54.519
we've lost so much air already!

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:55.587
Huh?

00:20:56.955 --> 00:21:00.192
What is that? A light
in the darkness?

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:02.861
Wait, is that Fishman Island?

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:04.896
Maybe Luffy beat us there!

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.933
It can't be. We haven't
descended the last 3,000 meters.

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:10.702
"Who are you? A friend?"

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.937
Stop!

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.040
If you wanna flash signals,
do it without actually flashing!

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:16.108
Can you tell what it is?

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.577
[CHOPPER] No, it's still
too bright to see.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.481
[gasps] Oh, no!

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:27.819
An anglerfish! We're screwed!

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:28.954
[CHOPPER screams]

00:21:28.987 --> 00:21:32.424
The deep-sea hunter fooled us,
hook, line, and sinker!

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.995
[USOPP]
Uh! A little close that time!

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:39.498
There isn't anywhere
left for us to run.

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.099
What can we do?

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:44.102
[screams]

00:21:45.604 --> 00:21:47.406
[whimpering]

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.141
This can't be happening!

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.575
It's human?

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.611
No! This doesn't make any sense!

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:57.916
A sea monster... that's
taken on the form of a man!

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:02.354
It's a sea bonze!

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:08.260
[CHOPPER] Ah! He's gonna
capsize the ship!

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:10.128
[ALL screaming]

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:12.497
What the--?

00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:14.132
[WADATSUMI]
Hey, that's naughty!

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.002
You know better, Ankoro! Ugh.

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:19.438
You're not allowed to eat ships!

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.974
How many times do
I have to tell you?

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:25.043
Captain Vander Decken
won't be happy

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:26.345
when he hears about this.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:29.614
Wait. Did he just help us?

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:30.816
Who freakin' cares?

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:34.353
Let's just make a break for it!
He might change his mind!

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:36.955
[WADATSUMI]
Uh?

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:38.490
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:49.067
Gah! Oh, please, no more!

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.610
[screams]

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.094
[NARRATOR] The legendary ghost
ship, the Flying Dutchman,

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:17.529
emerges from the darkness,

00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.931
closing in on the
horrified Straw Hats.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:22.834
However, before they encounter
its creepy captain,

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:26.738
a volcano erupts, sending
them diving into a trench.

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.207
What they find there
is not the sea floor

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.176
but another deadly nightmare.

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:32.844
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:37.082
"Undersea Volcanic Eruption!
Drifting to the Fishman Island!"

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.551
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
