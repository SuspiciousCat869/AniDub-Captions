00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,150
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,660
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,330
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,330
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,240
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,610
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,040
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,510
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,450
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,350
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,590
[DOGGUIN] If any of you
so much as touch this lady,

48
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,190
you'll regret it!

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,200
What the heck is going on here?

50
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,400
Isn't that penguin
one of the zombies?

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,470
Did you notice
his fighting style?

52
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,370
It can't be.

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,370
Hey! Dumbass!

54
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,040
You're really starting
to piss me off, chum!

55
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,780
You're fighting the
wrong enemy, idiot!

56
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,710
The girl is one of our targets!

57
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,080
[DOGGUIN] Anyone who
mistreats a lady is gonna get

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,250
a crash course in table
manners from yours truly.

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,490
You got that?
You crappy zombies!

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,560
That dog-penguin is--
It's him. I'm sure of it!

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,130
They're stubborn,
huh? What a pain.

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,270
Now Gum-Gum Gatling!

That move! Zoro!

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,430
Zoro! What's your problem?
That's dangerous!

67
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,450
Scars on the back are the
shame of a swordsman, but...

68
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,890
[FRANKY] What the--?

69
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,790
[LUFFY]
Arrrggh!!

70
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,530
This sucks! Stop it!
Lemme outta here!

71
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,300
Is that a coffin?

72
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,300
[LUFFY] Open up this box and
let me out! You hear me?

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,230
[ROBIN] That voice.

74
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
What are you doing
in that box, dumbass?

75
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,640
Why'd you go and get
yourself caught like that?

76
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,170
Hey! Straw Hat!

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,840
[TARARAN] That's far enough.

78
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,150
[TARARAN] Hey! Hey!
Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

79
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,820
All those stories you've
heard about Spider Monkeys?

80
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,390
You're looking
at one! That's me!

81
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,530
A giant spider!

82
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,660
Even for a monkey, that's
damn big. It's a monster!

83
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,270
[LUFFY] I'm warning you!
Lemme outta this box or else!

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,230
[TARARAN] Ah! Looks like
we've got another one!

85
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,500
It sounds like it hit the floor!

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,610
Damn it! What are you
punks gonna do to him?

87
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,840
Oh, don't worry.

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,580
You'll find out soon enough,
since you're gonna be next.

89
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,420
But I'd be more worried
about myself, if I were you!

90
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,950
You've got me
in front of you,

91
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,590
and armored warrior zombies
closing in from behind.

92
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,420
There's no escape!
Prepare for annihilation!

93
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,900

Hey! What're you trying
to pull here, Newbie?

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,490
[RANDOM WILD ZOMBIE 347A] Our
Master's orders are absolute!

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,660
We zombies couldn't oppose
them even if we tried!

98
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,900
But that doesn't
affect him at all!

99
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,430
What makes him different?

100
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,240
And wait, why is he
as strong as a General?

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,340
[DOGGUIN] My power is one
that is not bound by logic.

102
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,610
It makes the
impossible possible.

103
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,410
This unstoppable
force that rages

104
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,250
like a hurricane is
none other--than love.

105
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,950
I'm not exactly
sure how this works,

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,290
but if he's saying stupid things
like that, that must be Sanji.

107
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,190
[CHOPPER] You're right!

108
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,460
Hey Sanji, is that
really you in there?

109
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,960
Or maybe you're just
friends with Sanji?

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,700
Either way, he's our friend,
so maybe we should--

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,930
[DOGGUIN] Shut your trap,
you damn dirty pirates!

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,100
Whoa!

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,870
I guess that means we're
still his enemy after all.

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,420
Are you trying to kiss me
or gnaw my face off?

138
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,890
Well! Don't mind if I do!

139
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,690
[ABSALOM] You're not
listening to me at all!

141
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,060
[USOPP] So are they
friends, or enemies?

142
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,860
[CHOPPER] Frienemies?

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,400
You don't give up.

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,830
[ABSALOM] I'll be taking
my bride, thank you!

176
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,230
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
Nami, you can fly? Awesome!

177
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,130
Idiots! I'm being abducted here!

178
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,070
Huh? By who?

179
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,440
Hey, come back!

180
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,510
[ABSALOM] We'll hold the
wedding ceremony immediately.

181
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,110
All the preparations
have already been made.

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,410
[NAMI]
You're that invisible pervert

183
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,650
from the shower, aren't you?

184
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,580
Let me go!

185
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,420
Whoa. I guess he
really is invisible, huh?

186
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,580
Nami!

187
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,430
[NAMI thinking] Just like
last time. Who is this guy?

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,500
[ABSALOM] I was sizing you up.

189
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:20,170
In short, I've determined
that you're fit to be my bride.

190
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,140
[ABSALOM] You may
call me. Absalom.

191
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,110
It's the name of your future
husband, so remember it well!

192
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,150
You've got a
lot of nerve looking

193
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,280
at me naked and
acting like you own me!

194
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,450
I don't keep myself in shape

195
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,790
so some sick voyeur
can drool over me!

196
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,820
So don't treat me like a
piece of meat, you animal!

197
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,660
[NAMI] Thunder Charge!

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,240
[USOPP] Nami!

199
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,340
[USOPP]
Great job!

200
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,180
Now keep running! Don't stop!

201
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,150
[USOPP] We gotta
get out of this forest!

202
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,150
What happened?

203
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,350
Even after that,
he's still standing up?

204
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,580
That guy is not normal!

205
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,320
Just look at him!

206
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,660
[ABSALOM] What is this feeling?

207
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,330
Every nerve in my body
is dancing! I'm on fire!

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,230
I can feel it coursing
through my veins,

209
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,770
as if I've been
struck by lightning!

210
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,910
I see! There can
be only one answer!

211
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,610
This must be--Love!

212
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,410
[LOLA] You're not getting away!

213
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,350
[ZOMBIE HORSE] We gotta stop
staring and start moving!

214
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,290
Even if Absalom's here, it's
still our job to catch them!

215
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,950
[ZOMBIE PANDA] You're right,
and if we fail,

216
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,890
Perona's gonna punish us!

217
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,790
[ZOMBIE HORSE] We can't
mess this up again!

218
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,860
[ZOMBIE PANDA]
Yeah, we need a game plan!

219
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,800
Not good. At this rate,
they're going to hurt her.

220
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,630
I don't know why it is,
but I feel like I have

221
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,470
to protect that
lady no matter what.

222
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,470
Why is this body so weak?

223
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,880
I can't even take a single step!

224
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,550
[ZOMBIE KOALA] High-tail it
you guys, we gotta catch up!

225
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,220
Stop and heed my words,
Wild Zombies!

226
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,950
The woman is mine--
don't harm her.

227
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,460
Shut up!
Screw you, Perv-salom!

228
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,830
[ZOMBIE HIPPO]
You can't boss us around--

229
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,630
we only answer
to Mistress Perona.

230
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,560
This is out of
your jurisdiction!

231
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,900
Stay out of our way!

232
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,730
[ZOMBIE KOALA]
We don't need you, loser!

233
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,570
Go look at your girly mags!

234
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,500
[ZOMBIE HIPPO]
We can handle this!

235
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,640
I said stop, damn it!

236
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,440
[ABSALOM] I'm not a fool.

237
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,310
I know you're under
Perona's command.

238
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,920
[ABSALOM] But if you have
the sense to fear her,

239
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,320
you should know how
frightful I can be as well.

240
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,430
In other words, mind your
tongue when you speak to me.

241
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
You understand?

242
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,340
[ABSALOM] What the
hell do you want?

243
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,440
I won't let you
touch that lady.

244
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,310
What did you say?

245
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,980
Hey, newbie, cut it out, man.

246
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,650
Absalom's mad enough already!

247
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,720
No, not that!

248
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,490
Here it comes.

249
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,750
I warned you, didn't I?
Mind your tongue.

250
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,620
[LOLA] Get back here,
Cat Burglar!

251
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,090
Uh, hey Nami, I think
she's only chasing after you!

252
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,090
You're right!

253
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,590
What the heck is going
on here? What a pain!

254
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,860
[USOPP]
So I was thinking...

255
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,400
Maybe we could just
sorta split up?

256
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,870
Selling me out,
you heartless bastard?

257
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,870
[LOLA] Get back here
and die already!

258
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,810
Women are scary!

259
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,110
You'll have to
run faster than that!

260
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,950
Slow down, Nami!

261
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,580
[USOPP] You're using us as
a shield, aren't you? No fair!

262
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,500
[thinking] That's it!
I'm done for!

263
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,770
[thinking] So long, everyone.
It was nice knowing you.

264
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Spread my ashes in the
East Blue for me, okay?

265
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,580
[LOLA] I'll brutalize you!

266
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Huh? We're not dead after all.

267
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
You mean she's gone?

268
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,690
[USOPP] I guess she
really did just want Nami.

269
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,920
[BOTH] Wow, that's great.
What a relief.

270
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,100
Oh crap! Nami!

271
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,510
Okay, Chopper,
full speed ahead!

272
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:02,940
[CHOPPER] Right!

273
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,810
Talley-ho!

274
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,150
Give back my husband!

275
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,890
What does that even mean?

276
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,960
[USOPP] Nami!
You big pink eyesore!

277
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,130
Leave her alone!

278
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,470
[USOPP] Get out of here, Nami!

279
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,570
[LOLA] Love stops for nothing!

280
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,510
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
Damn it! She's too strong!

281
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,570
[FRANKY] I see. So that's
what happened to 'em.

282
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,540
[LUFFY] I'm warning you!

283
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:06,310
Lemme outta this box
or else! You hear me?

284
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,310
You captured our
crewmates, didn't you?

285
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,410
And carried them behind that
wall, like with Straw Hat.

286
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,420
Monkey monkey! Ah-ah-ah-ah!
That's correct.

287
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,890
And just wait,
because any second now

288
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,720
you'll be suffering
the same fate!

289
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,730
Zombie Generals in the front.

290
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,100
Zombie Generals behind.
I'd give up if I were you!

291
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,770
Whether you're a dumbass
monkey or a dumbass spider,

292
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,840
it looks like that big sticky
web that caught the Sunny

293
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,870
when we came here was your
work. If I'm not mistaken.

294
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,580
[FRANKY] In other words,

295
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,410
you were after us
from the beginning.

296
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,620
That must mean you
had us under watch, huh?

297
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,520
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

298
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,850
Yep! Once on Thriller Bark,
there's no hiding!

299
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,020
Mistress Perona's
Ghost Network sees all,

300
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,360
knows all, and tells all!

301
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,600
Frankly, you were
doomed from the start!

302
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,630
Those big ears
of yours must be useful

303
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,870
for gathering information, too.

304
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,100
And you certainly
like to run your mouth.

305
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,440
Huh? Sorry, what was that?

306
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,380
You mean they're just for show?

307
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,550
Franky.

308
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,720
Yeah. I got it.

309
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,820
We're completely surrounded.

310
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,720
"Worst-case scenario"
they call it, right?

311
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,630
What we need is a
last-second miracle plan.

312
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,460
Heh. You think I can handle it?

313
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,930
I'd love to see you try.

314
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,830
Put on a good show for me.

315
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,800
You got it.
Just follow my lead!

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,470
What's he doing?

317
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,070
Check this one out.

318
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,640
Hey! Don't do that--
have you lost your mind?

319
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,950
Coup de Vent!

320
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,020
[TARARAN] Aw, crap!
Aaaah!

321
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,020
You can't break the
friggin' bridge, man!

322
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,820
That's cheating!

323
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,000
[FRANKY] So? My plan
super enough for you?

324
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,700
[ROBIN] Well,
it certainly is violent.

325
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,120
Now, Cien Fleurs...

326
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,950
...Wing!

327
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,520
What?

328
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,960
[FRANKY] You... You can fly?

329
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,230
[ROBIN] Yes. For five seconds.

330
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,700
[FRANKY] Lame! But actually,
that's all we need.

331
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,470
Strong Right!

332
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,810
Sweet! I got the ledge!

333
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,850
That's the building where
they took Straw Hat.

334
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,150
If we can make it up
there, we can save him.

335
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,990
I'm sorry.
I can't hold it.

336
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,720
[FRANKY] Arm Return!

337
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,760
Just a little more. Hey!

338
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,020
[ROBIN] A fall like
that won't stop a zombie,

339
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,720
but at least they're trapped
in the courtyard for now.

340
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,790
That should buy us some time.

341
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,560
Excellent work, Franky.

342
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,200
Yeah, thanks a lot!
How generous of you

343
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,600
to pay a compliment
to your stepping stone!

344
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,570
How 'bout an apology?

345
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,070
[ROBIN] We should hurry
while they're still down.

346
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,210
[FRANKY] Hey! Don't pretend
like you didn't hear me!

347
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,610
You could try helping
me up at least!

348
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,610
Hm? See something?

349
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,620
Damn. I guess that's
the undead for you.

350
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,060
Now I'm angry.
You are gonna pay for this!

351
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,570
You realize
I'm a spider, right?

352
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,170
Gimme two seconds and
I'll be right up there!

353
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,910
I'd start running if I were you!
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

354
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,820
Hm? What is that?

355
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,750
Looks like something's
falling up there.

356
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,290
Aaaaaaaaah!

357
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,930
No, someone is falling!

358
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,100
Huh?

359
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,800
Aaaaaaaaah!

360
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,670
[RANDOM ZOMBIE GENERAL 347A]
You guys see that?

361
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,870
[BROOK] What do you
call a flying skeleton?

362
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,680
Air bone!

363
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,790
[FRANKY] Whoa, look! Who is
that falling from the sky?

364
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,220
[ROBIN] Take a closer
look and you'll see.

365
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,790
[FRANKY] Oh yeah! That afro.

366
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,130
[ROBIN] And that cane as well.

367
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,800
[FRANKY] I guess it's
fro-tally obvious, huh?

368
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,700
[ROBIN] Yes. You might
say you cane'nt miss him.

369
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,330
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

370
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,200
"Appearing from the Sky!

371
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,740
That Man is the
Humming Swordsman!"

372
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
