1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,393
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:18,193
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,994
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:33,083
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,180
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:22,090
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,095
[NARRATOR] In God Eneru's land,
the Upper Yard, a battle rages.

25
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:30,390
On one side, Ohm and
his guard dog, Holy.

26
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:33,560
And on the other, Wyper,
a Shandorian warrior.

27
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:36,146
Gan Fall, the Sky Knight.

28
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,148
And Zoro!

29
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:41,484
Each warrior loyal to his own
cause yet bound to the others

30
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:45,071
in a struggle to survive
Ohm's Ordeal of Iron.

31
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,993
[gasping]

32
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:51,953
You idiot!

33
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,496
Aisa...

34
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:55,957
[OHM]
You were so distracted

35
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,918
that you neglected
to protect yourselves.

36
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:02,213
Quit worryin' about
other people!

37
00:03:02,297 --> 00:03:03,715
Accept it.

38
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,468
There's nothing you
can do to save them.

39
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:17,479
[LUFFY] "The Ordeal of Iron!
White Barbed Death Match!"

40
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,817
[bleating]

41
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,944
We're behind with you, Ohm!

42
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,488
[OHM]
Quite the gathering.

43
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:29,240
How many players remain
in our little game?

44
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,618
We have four
Divine Squad members.

45
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,621
And since I doubt the wounds
I dealt those two were fatal,

46
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:36,373
that leaves us with
four Shandorians

47
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,916
and one Blue Sea dweller.

48
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,960
Counting the Lord
of the Sky and Holy,

49
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,546
that's ten people
and two animals.

50
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,924
Soon we'll pare that
number down to five,

51
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:50,929
just as God Eneru predicted.
So, there we stand.

52
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,056
Let the game commence.

53
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,766
You will pay...

54
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,268
...for harming Wyper!

55
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:58,687
Is that so?

56
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,106
You'd willingly forfeit
your life for this sad speck?

57
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:03,525
Mind who you throw
your loyalty to, savage!

58
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,944
How dare you?!
Wyper is our leader!

59
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:09,906
You have now broken the most
sacred of Shandorian laws!

60
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,118
We're here to reclaim our
homeland and our honor!

61
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,870
You and all servants of
the abominable Eneru

62
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,455
will settle your debt...

63
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:19,416
...with flesh and bone!

64
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:20,917
[OHM]
You are savages.

65
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,752
No more worthy of reparations

66
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,796
than the weeds crushed
beneath my feet!

67
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,131
[grunts]

68
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,675
Who wants to die first?

69
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:32,137
Ahh! Back to Hell, demon!

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,222
[grunts] Huh?!

71
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:44,733
You cannot run!

72
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:48,737
Enough of this... Holy,
it's time for your Mad Dash.

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,364
[HOLY grunting]

74
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:56,244
Huh?!

75
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,455
[yelling]

76
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,750
[groaning]

77
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:06,046
[gasps, screams]

78
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:08,757
Don't stop! Finish it!

79
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:21,895
[gasps]

80
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,651
He's building some
kind of fence.

81
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,070
Damn.

82
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:33,406
He's using more of his tricks.
This could be trouble.

83
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,367
[grunts] No tricks here!

84
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,661
Behold, the Ordeal of Iron!

85
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,832
[DIVINE SQUAD A] The White
Barbed Death Match has begun!

86
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:46,378
So, you can put up a fence.

87
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:50,006
Big deal. I wasn't
planning to run.

88
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,424
[bleats]

89
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:54,469
The purpose of this barrier
isn't just to hold you.

90
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:58,223
Yes, there's a reason
it's called White Barbs.

91
00:05:58,306 --> 00:05:59,140
What's that?

92
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:00,517
[WYPER]
Huh?

93
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,812
[WYPER]
Show us!

94
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:05,897
[groaning]

95
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:13,363
I guess the thorns are painful.
Thanks for the warning.

96
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:17,450
So how do I get outta here
once I'm done with all'a you?

97
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:21,121
You can worry about that later,
assuming you survive.

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,380
[OHM] Only eight people
and two animals left.

99
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:35,135
I've gotta help Nami and that
old guy who saved Chopper.

100
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,471
Somehow...

101
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,767
It's Gan Fall the Sky Knight!

102
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:45,395
I have to get 'em out
of that stupid snake.

103
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:47,355
[WYPER growls]

104
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,858
[SNAKE roars]

105
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,276
[yelps]

106
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,570
[WYPER growling]

107
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,241
[LAKI]
Wyper...

108
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:01,995
I still remember the story you
told me when we were children.

109
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,544
[WYPER] Our ancestors
weren't born in the sky.

110
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,796
They originally lived
in the Blue Sea world,

111
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,008
in the sacred city
known as Shandora.

112
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:18,803
It was protected by
the Great Warrior Kalgara.

113
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,639
Until 400 years ago.

114
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,850
The entire city was
torn from the ground

115
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:27,228
and lifted up into Skypiea
by the Knockup Stream.

116
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,939
Our people were left stranded.

117
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:32,233
It must have been
very hard on them.

118
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,820
But at least they still had
a place they could call home.

119
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:39,282
But then, on one fateful day,
the Skypieans bared

120
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:43,119
their vicious fangs and
revealed their true intentions.

121
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:45,455
Without mercy they
seized Shandora,

122
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:47,665
claiming it as sacred ground.

123
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,543
Our ancestors were driven off
the land they had nourished

124
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:55,173
and cared for since
the first setting sun.

125
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,551
For 400 years now, we have
suffered the humiliation

126
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:01,721
of being driven away
from our birthright.

127
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,266
[WYPER]
Never forget, Laki.

128
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,770
The Upper Yard belongs to us!

129
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:11,773
We will take back what is ours!

130
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:14,609
Our homeland!

131
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,486
Our pride!

132
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,449
[KAMAKIRI] Once we kill Eneru,
there will be no need for you

133
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:25,120
to sneak around obsessing
over a single bag of Vearth.

134
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,997
We will return after
400 years of exile

135
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,375
to the true home
of the Shandorians!

136
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,420
If you don't think you're
up to it, stay behind!

137
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,839
I won't hold it against you.

138
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,174
[BRAHAM]
Come on, Wyper, don't say that.

139
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:40,218
You know we're up to it.

140
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,678
[WYPER]
Are you up to abandoning

141
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:44,264
anyone who falls
during the battle?

142
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:48,435
[WYPER] If you can step over the
bodies of your dying comrades

143
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,438
and keep fighting,
then follow me.

144
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:55,108
Now, I swear.

145
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,485
Eneru's head will be mine.

146
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,282
[LAKI]
Wyper...

147
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:07,871
[DIVINE SQUAD groaning]

148
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:25,722
[roars]

149
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,102
[LAKI grunts]

150
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:33,188
[LAKI gasps]

151
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:37,359
[LAKI]
Wyper!

152
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,362
[WYPER]
Huh?

153
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:41,363
[panting]

154
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,616
Wyper! Listen!

155
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:45,658
Laki!

156
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:48,745
Quickly! There isn't much time!

157
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:52,165
What's wrong?
Why are you here?

158
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,711
I had to come to give you
Kamakiri's warning!

159
00:09:56,795 --> 00:10:00,006
Nobody can beat... Eneru...

160
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,092
You must run away!

161
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,678
Abandon this fight!

162
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,720
[WYPER grunts]

163
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,722
[LAKI panting]

164
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:16,439
Eneru. He's in the forest.

165
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:18,024
Enough!

166
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:23,321
Eneru is lightning itself. He
truly has the powers of a God!

167
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,989
Stop!

168
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,574
Leave! At once!

169
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,410
He cannot be defeated!

170
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,120
[WYPER]
Do as I say!

171
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,708
[LAKI]
Wyper...

172
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,470
Did I hear my name?

173
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:51,933
Eneru.

174
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,980
[DIVINE SQUAD A bleating]

175
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,314
Eneru!

176
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,899
Leave her be!

177
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,027

I'm the one you want!

She has no part in this!

180
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,741
Laki!

181
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:09,451
Run!

Laki, no!

183
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,376
Put the gun down!

You're a fool!

188
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:38,355
I'd forget about her and
worry more about myself!

Laki... Hear me.

193
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:56,873
[KAMAKIRI]
He comes as lightening.

194
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:59,709
An element that man has
feared from the beginning,

195
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:01,711
and rightly so.

196
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,880

Huh?

201
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,228
You damn fool.

writhing in pure agony.

[grunts, groans]

211
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,619
You didn't actually
think I'd spare her?

212
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:19,622
Wyper, the "ruthless
Shandorian warrior."

213
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:22,500
Surely you understand
the concept of "no mercy"?

214
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,962
She opposed me,
and now she's dead.

215
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,715
You'll join her soon enough.

Wyper.

Weep not for her.

224
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,934
Laki received the
divine judgment

225
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:25,647
that all God's children
pray for. She is free.

226

Since we're all
gettin' personal,

there's a score I
have to settle as well.

Ah, yes. Of course.

Right, for the umpteenth time...

Calm down. We'll survive.

doing out there?

You should be on the ship.

Tell that to the creeps
who were chasing us.

I don't know.

I just got stuck here
and I can't get out.

310
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,377
Incredible.

311
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,004
What are the chances that each
of us would get swallowed?

312
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,715

to be a serious problem.

Huh, what do you
mean swallowed?

Uh! A snake?

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,014
Who'd you think this
stomach belonged to?

316
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:31,601
But... How could you
be here talking to me

317
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,396
if you were swallowed
by a giant snake?

318
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,648

Is he a... jester?

325
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,208
That job would suit him best

326
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,627
but he's actually Captain.

Yeah, that's pretty much
the reaction everyone has.

You mean we're being
eaten by a snake?!

Whoa, you're right!

00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,865
Well, what're we waitin' for?

341
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,867
We need to find its
butthole right away!

342
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,910
Ridiculous.

343
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:32,829
You're despicable!

344
00:19:32,912 --> 00:19:34,247
Why? Maybe we can get out

345
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,249
next time the snake
goes to the bathroom.

346
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:40,337
No! I'd rather get digested!

347
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,838
Nami's scary.

348
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:45,008
I know what you mean, child.
She's meaner than the snake.

[sighs]

350
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,428
Hardly. When the snake
gets in a bad mood

351
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,804
it starts eating people.

352
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,223
And speaking of which,
we'd better think fast.

353
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,434
Its temper was wild enough
on the outside, and be--

354
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:57,062
[LUFFY] Wait, the snake was
in a "bad mood"?

355
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:59,105
Yeah, right.
All hisses and fangs.

356
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:01,983
In fact, before it attacked us,
it was writhing in pain.

357
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,777
[LUFFY]
Hm. That's weird.

358
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,446
I wonder what was bothering it?

359
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,992
[ALL gasp]

360
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,243
[LUFFY]
Hm?

361
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,912
[NAMI] Luffy. What have
you been doing in here?

362
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,331
Oh. I was tryin' to
bust through a wall.

363
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,582
Didn't work, though.

364
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,626
[laughing]

365
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,462
Ah, so this is all your doing.

366
00:20:22,545 --> 00:20:25,215
Throwing all those punches
burned up a lot of energy.

367
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:29,427
Say, um... Did any of you
think to bring some food?

368
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,056
What's wrong?

369
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:38,687
How about you eat my fist!

370
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:44,442
[growling]

371
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:48,947
[ALL gasping]

372
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:55,203
[ALL screaming]

373
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:03,128
[roars]

374
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,594
Heh.

375
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,849
What's the matter,
gotta belly ache?

376
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:17,559
It serves ya right!

377
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:22,355
[SNAKE growls]

378
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,734
[WYPER]
It won't be long, Aisa! Hold on!

379
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:31,156
[WYPER]
Open up, serpent!

380
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:39,205
[SNAKE grunts]

381
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,666
[WYPER grunts]

382
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:57,265
I've got to get to Nami
before it's too late.

383
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,435
Well, unless it's
too late already.

384
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,354
[gasps]

385
00:22:11,237 --> 00:22:14,657
You're not gonna
stand in my way.

386
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:17,952
It's time for final judgment.

387
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:29,964
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

388
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,551
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

389
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:37,555
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

390
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,142
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

391
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

392
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:48,942
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

393
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:52,028
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

394
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:57,242
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

395
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,286
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

396
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,205
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

397
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

398
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,585
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

399
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,504
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

400
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:12,257
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

401
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,675
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

402
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,552
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

403
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:19,389
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

404
00:23:19,472 --> 00:23:21,224
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

405
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:25,061
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

406
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,231
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

407
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,664
[LUFFY] Okay! Let's hurry up
and get out its butt hole!

408
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,291
[NAMI]
I told you, forget it!

409
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:47,375
[LUFFY]
Let's get pooped!

410
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,460
[ZORO]
Stand aside!

411
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:50,378
[OHM]
You misunderstand, swordsman.

412
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,630
Survival is not
an option for you.

413
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:55,717
Pray to God for mercy,
for I show none.

414
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,137
[ZORO] Don't be an idiot!
I never pray for anything!

415
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,930
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

416
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:03,933
"Bursting Slash! Zoro vs. Ohm!"

417
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,519
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
