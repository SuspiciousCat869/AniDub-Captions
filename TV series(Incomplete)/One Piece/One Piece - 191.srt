1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:21,756
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,181
Raigo.

25
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,782
Angel Island's gone.

26
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,034
How could you?

27
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:57,375
The City of Gold...

28
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:01,171
You know for a fact
it exists, right?

29
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:02,505
I just...

30
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:05,175
I need let Old Timer and
the others down below know

31
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:07,969
that the City of Gold
is actually up in the sky!

32
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,264
If I ring the bell,
they should hear it.

33
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:12,974
Otherwise, Old Timer
will keep searching

34
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,517
the ocean floor forever!

35
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,478
I can't let Eneru take it.

36
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,606
So I'm not stopping
until I hear the sounds

37
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,107
of the Golden Bell.

38
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,989
[LUFFY] "Knock Over Giant Jack!
Last Hope for Escape!"

39
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,583
[AMAZON] Even Heaven's
Gate was blown away

40
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,377
in the twinkling of an eye.

41
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:45,674
Angel Island.
It's completely destroyed.

42
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,133
But what are we supposed to do?

43
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,718
And where do we go?

44
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,845
To Cloud End, and then
down to the Blue Sea

45
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,389
like Captain McKinley said!

46
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,682
It's our only choice.

47
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,058
Hold on.

48
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,685
There are still a lot of people
in the White-White Sea

49
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,228
who haven't been evacuated yet!

50
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,355
[ISLANDER B] The Milky Roads
leading there've been destroyed!

51
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:01,564
They're gone!

52
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:02,982
I don't know how we can
bring those ships down

53
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,567
without them!

54
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,194
[ISLANDER C] So you're saying we
just leave those people to die?

55
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,292
[ISLANDERS yelling]

56
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,723
We're all doomed.

57
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:39,394
[AMAZON sighs]

58
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,730
The White-White Sea is lost.

59
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:48,153
Skypiea... it's fading away.

60
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,027
So this is it.

61
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,157
Splendid!

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,492
At last!

63
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,827
The grand belfry
that was once the pride

64
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:41,748
of the legendary
city of Shandora!

65
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,833
Now it's mine!

66
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:47,337
A prize befitting a god
of my power and glory!

67
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,340
The fabled bell, the one
that heralded the start

68
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:53,468
of this land's
400-year old conflict.

69
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,513
How pathetic.

70
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,182
To think they carried on
their pointless little battle

71
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:00,767
for centuries...

72
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,484
...only to see
everything be destroyed.

73
00:06:19,494 --> 00:06:20,620
[LUFFY grunts]

74
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:23,081
[NAMI] Luffy, you can't
catch up with him!

75
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:24,165
[LUFFY gasps]

76
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,005
[NAMI] Eneru's ark hasn't
moved from that spot.

77
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,798
That can only mean one thing.

78
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:41,266
[NAMI]
Luffy.

79
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,101
Eneru's been up
there for a while.

80
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:45,603
He must have taken
the golden bell by now.

81
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,026
[NAMI] No matter hard
you stretch your arms,

82
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,819
there's no way you
can reach up there.

83
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,071
[LUFFY] If he took it,
I'm gonna take it back!

84
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,072
Gimme the waver!

85
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:59,826
[engine running]

86
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,788
[LUFFY yelling]

87
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,666
[LUFFY grunts]

88
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:18,386
[NAMI] He's too far from
the top of the beanstalk.

89
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,806
What can we do?
How can we get to him?

90
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,434
[LUFFY yelling]

91
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:26,102
[NAMI]
There must be a way!

92
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:29,939
[NAMI gasps]

93
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:31,983
[NAMI]
The others!

94
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,778
[ENERU]
Every inhabitant of Skypiea

95
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,822
will suffer my terrible wrath!

96
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:42,077
All will perish, including the
voices directly beneath you.

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,244
[LUFFY grunts]

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,290
[NAMI]
That's right!

99
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,417
Everyone's still down there!

100
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,795
But how do we let them
know we need help?

101
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,006
[LUFFY yells]

102
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:13,650
Watch out!

103
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,985
Something's falling
towards us again!

104
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,862
--[ZORO] Wait, it's...
--[USOPP] Take cover!

105
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:23,493
[AISA]
A leaf?

106
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:25,745
[USOPP]
Huh?

107
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,375
[AISA]
Hey, look!

108
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,502
There's something written on it.

109
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:33,545
[gasps]

110
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,839
It's a message!
From Nami and Luffy!

111
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,757
[USOPP]
Huh?

112
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:38,967
What's it say?

113
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,556
"Cut down this beanstalk
and make sure it falls

114
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,974
towards the west."

115
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:48,935
[USOPP]
What?!

116
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,771
But... What'll happen
if we do that?

117
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,067
Hey, Knight?
Which way's west?

118
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,068
Well...

119
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,903
You mean we're
really gonna do it?

120
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,573
I mean... Which way's west?

121
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,408
[GAN FALL] There, in the
direction of the cloud

122
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:05,827
where Eneru's ark
is currently moored.

123
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,802
[ISLANDERS gasp]

124
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:35,815
[ENERU] I've accomplished all
of my objectives but one.

125
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,025
So now...

126
00:09:40,653 --> 00:09:42,697
It's time I destroyed
this pathetic land

127
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:45,033
and the Cumuloregalis
Clouds it rests on,

128
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,077
and set off for
the Endless Vearth.

129
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,206
[laughing]

130
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,793
I'm actually gonna miss toying
with the Skypieans' lives!

131
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,170
[USOPP whimpers]

132
00:09:58,546 --> 00:09:59,631
Eneru!

133
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,176
Damn him.

134
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,095
Do you see that?

135
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,972
This one's even bigger!

136
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,434
Maybe we should get out of here

137
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:14,646
wh-while there's still
some place to get!

138
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:21,152
[ENERU laughing]

139
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,530
Say goodbye, Skypiea!

140
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,410
It's even bigger
than his last one!

141
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:29,869
That bastard!

142
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:32,497
Now that he's got his grubby
hands on the golden bell,

143
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,541
he has no more use for Skypiea!

144
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:37,335
That creep's pretty
easy to figure out!

145
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,462
Well, don't just
stand there, Luffy!

146
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,339
We can't let him
get away with this!

147
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:46,428
Wait, "we"?
But weren't you gonna escape?

148
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,721
Yeah, well...

149
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,806
I can't leave now
with what's at stake.

150
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,559
Besides, you want to
ring that golden bell, right?

151
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:53,518
I've gotta!

152
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:54,769
For Old Timer!

153
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:59,983
But... with your arm,
you can't drive the waver.

154
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,277
If I left you here,
you'd keep trying to jump up,

155
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,779
so leave the driving to me
and I'll get you up there.

156
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,700
Listen.

157
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:11,995
You've got to promise
that you'll get us

158
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,330
out of this mess
in one piece, okay?

159
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:15,874
Yeah. You got it!

160
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,125
And thanks!

161
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,298
[NAMI] We've only got one
chance to get this thing right!

162
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:27,260
I just hope they got my
message and understand

163
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,928
what we're attempting to do.

164
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,280
Let me get this straight!

165
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:49,908
They're gonna jump to the ark
from the falling beanstalk?

166
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,202
[ZORO]
You got any better ideas?

167
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:54,454
Well that's crazy.
They can't be serious.

168
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:56,206
Fine, then I'll leave it
to you to climb up there

169
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,290
and stop Luffy.

170
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:58,667
He won't listen!

171
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,379
Look, I don't care
how crazy it sounds!

172
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,421
We have no choice!

173
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,881
We've gotta let him do this!

174
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:06,257
[WYPER, AISA grunt]

175
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:08,760
[USOPP]
Wh-What the--?

176
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:09,719
[ROBIN]
Long nose!

177
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,388
[USOPP]
I got 'em!

178
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,847
[yelps]

179
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,849
If we stay here, we're just
gonna get pushed down

180
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,352
to the ruins below! Run!

181
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,229
Get away from the beanstalk!

182
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:22,065
I'll take care of it!

183
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:24,484
All I need to do is cut the vine
down towards that ship, right?

184
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,860
But--!

185
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,696
[ZORO] That maniac is about
to wipe this land away,

186
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,447
and there are only two
people who can reach him

187
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,199
before he sets that thing off!

188
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,283
Zoro, wait!

189
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,494
Nami! Luffy!
Ya better get ready!

190
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,252
You fools from the
Blue Sea just don't know

191
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,628
when to give up, do you?

192
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:46,339
It's far too late
to change things now.

193
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,174
The minute you entered
the survival game,

194
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,510
your fates were cast in stone.

195
00:12:50,593 --> 00:12:52,846
Anything you do is futile.

196
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:59,060
O-Okay, he's gonna be just fine.

197
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:02,439
Zoro buddy, you're the
only one who can do this!

198
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,857
It's up to you!

199
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,194
[ZORO grunts]

200
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:11,239
[ZORO]
Eneru, I am so sick of you!

201
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,616
[ZORO yells]

202
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,379
All right! He did it!

203
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,427
[USOPP]
Zoro!

204
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,270
Insolent little worm.

205
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,361
He did it!

206
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,363
He did it and got zapped.

207
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,031
But he did it!

208
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:55,492
[ROBIN]
Oh, no. The vine!

209
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:00,538
The vine's not falling!

210
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,540
But he cut it!

211
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:05,001
What is that thing made out of?

212
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:08,380
It looks like a plant,
but it's solid as a rock!

213
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,714
[WYPER]
Pathetic!

214
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,384
This is what you outsiders
get for butting in!

215
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,844
[AISA]
Wyper, what are you doing?

216
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:16,304
[WYPER]
Quiet!

217
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,765
We Shandorians are the
descendents of Kalgara,

218
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:21,559
not that kid in the straw hat!

219
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,604
If anyone is to ring that bell,
it should rightfully be us!

220
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:25,980
Don't listen to him, Robin!

221
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,399
He's too banged-up to stop us!

222
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,317
Besides, Nami and Luffy
are counting on us!

223
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,613
Our only priority right now
is knocking that thing down!

224
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,657
Speaking of which,
Zoro's already cut through

225
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,075
half of the stem!

226
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:38,993
It probably shouldn't take
much to cut through

227
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,412
the rest of it!

228
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,497
My awesome Dance of
the Exploding Stars

229
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,832
should do the trick!

230
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,627
After just one little hit,
even a gentle breeze

231
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,046
will knock that thing over!

232
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,923
Once again, it's up to me!

233
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,801
The last line of defense
in our merry band!

234
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,470
Robin, leave all the
dangerous stuff to me!

235
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:00,056
You tend to our fallen comrades!

236
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,183
[ROBIN] They look like
an oak leaf mochi cake.

237
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:03,309
[USOPP]
Forward!

238
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,186
[laughing]

239
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,271
[ROBIN]
Hmm?

240
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,865
[ROBIN]
About that bell...

241
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,701
Four hundred years ago,
an explorer from my world

242
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:23,580
said he stumbled
upon a city of gold.

243
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:25,707
People laughed at him
and called him a liar.

244
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,793
But he has a descendent today
who still believes the stories,

245
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,795
and has spent years
searching the Blue Sea

246
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,089
for any evidence
of this City of Gold.

247
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,642
If that golden bell can be rung,

248
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,895
everyone will know the
City of Gold is in the sky

249
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,605
and not a myth.

250
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,690
That's the reason
Luffy's up there.

251
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:52,108
Now do you understand?

252
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,693
[USOPP]
Exploding Star!

253
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,613
[ROBIN]
Noble, isn't it?

254
00:15:56,696 --> 00:16:00,325
Trying to vindicate
a man he never met?

255
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,619
He's had chances to escape.

256
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:06,706
But he's stuck around
to see this thing through.

257
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,583
That guy's nuts!

258
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,627
[USOPP]
Rolling Exploding Star!

259
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,754
Usopp Rubber Band of Doom!

260
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,673
Regular Exploding Star!

261
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,925
[explosions]

262
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,641
[WYPER]
What--

263
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:28,103
What is the name of this
explorer's descendent?

264
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:30,480
[ROBIN]
Montblanc Cricket. Why?

265
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,901
The name of his
ancestor who came here.

266
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,739
Please tell me.

267
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:41,324
Was it Noland?

268
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,493
How--?

269
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:45,745
Wyper?

270
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:46,955
[grunts]

271
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,331
What's going on?

272
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,916
Why are you crying?

273
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,337
[WYPER]
Is this a sign from you?

274
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:56,798
Or a miracle?

275
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,551
What is it,
Great Warrior Kalgara?

276
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,305
[KALGARA]
Come, Nola!

277
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,558
We'll ring the bell again
today so the sound

278
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,893
reaches the ends of the earth!

279
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:11,104
Let's send the sound
you love to say hello

280
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:12,814
to our friend Noland!

281
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:14,816
[YOUNG SNAKE hissing]

282
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:25,577
[YOUNG SNAKE hissing]

283
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,454
[YOUNG SNAKE whines]

284
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:30,749
[SNAKE growls]

285
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:39,674
[USOPP grunts]

286
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,925
What the--?

287
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:49,768
What just did that?

288
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:52,687
Guess it doesn't matter,
'cause it couldn't even budge

289
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,689
that beanstalk!

290
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,025
Maybe one of my triple
explosions will do the trick.

291
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,985
--[WYPER] Move.
--[USOPP] Hey!

292
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,495
[WYPER]
Kalgara.

293
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:12,832
The descendent of your best
friend from the Blue Sea.

294
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,668
He's waiting for it.

295
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,462
The ringing of your golden bell!

296
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,340
[sniffling]

297
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,717
It's time we
rewarded his patience!

298
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:25,470
[WYPER]
Reject!

299
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,897
What the heck was that?!

300
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,898
Wyper!

301
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,817
[ROBIN gasps]

302
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,112
[GAN FALL]
That fool. A reject dial.

303
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:46,032
[WYPER]
Now fall, Giant Jack! Fall!

304
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:55,041
[GROUP gasps]

305
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,421
[USOPP]
Guys! We've got to run away!

306
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:04,175
[engine revving]

307
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,220
This is it! Get on, Luffy!

308
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:08,763
Gun it! Go!

309
00:19:10,974 --> 00:19:13,560
I should mention,
I've never revved this waver's

310
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:15,937
jet dial up to
maximum power before.

311
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,857
I was a little scared
to see how fast it would go.

312
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,234
I guess we're gonna find out
now if it'll be too strong

313
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,111
for me to control, huh?

314
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,404
Go for it, Nami!

315
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:25,572
[NAMI]
Okay!

316
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:26,698
[NAMI yelps]

317
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:30,994
[NAMI]
Hang on, Luffy!

318
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,287
[LUFFY]
I am!

319
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,710
[ISLANDERS chattering]

320
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,670
[ISLANDER D]
It's falling!

321
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,255
[ISLANDER E]
He's right!

322
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:45,133
[ISLANDER F]
What's going on up there?

323
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,885
Well, Nami, Luffy.

324
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,345
Good luck!

325
00:19:48,428 --> 00:19:49,679
We're counting on you!

326
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,348
If we let this place
be destroyed,

327
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,141
we'll never get to ring
that bell, and Cricket

328
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:54,309
will never hear it!

329
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,269
He helped us,
so we gotta help him!

330
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,271
Ring that bell and ring it loud!

331
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,400
Jump to Eneru's ship
and stop that guy!

332
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,028
Do it!

333
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:07,906
Everything's up to you
guys now, you got it?

334
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,282
Do it!

335
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,377
[ENERU]
My, my.

336
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,379
Now why can't you wait
for the completion of Raigo

337
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:25,298
like the rest of the insects?

338
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:27,926
Their impatience
will be their undoing.

339
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,137
Very well, then.

340
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:36,142
[NAMI yells]

341
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:37,811
Something's coming!

342
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,062
[LUFFY]
Don't slow down!

343
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,564
I'll take care of
whatever it is!

344
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,859
[NAMI yells]

345
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:50,198
That shot was pathetic!

346
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:53,034
[ENERU laughs]

347
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,161
That you should even
try to reach me now

348
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:58,373
is insolent far beyond
the point of stupidity!

349
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,375
Now pay for your folly!

350
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,127
Mamaragan!

351
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,513
That creep!

352
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:16,683
He's trying to destroy
the base of the beanstalk!

353
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:17,726
[LUFFY gasps]

354
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,269
[LUFFY]
Do something, Nami!

355
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:20,478
[NAMI]
Like what?

356
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:23,565
We're going too fast
and we're too high up!

357
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,400
If this thing loses
its foundation,

358
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,694
it'll crash before
we get to the top!

359
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:30,780
We won't reach Eneru,
and we'll fall to our deaths!

360
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,372
Upper Yard's being pummeled!

361
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,874
This is the end!

362
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,676
Luffy! Nami!

363
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,886
[LUFFY grunts]

364
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:59,684
[LUFFY growls]

365
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,561
[ENERU laughs]

366
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:03,313
Lightning may not harm you,

367
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:05,231
but your abilities
are absolutely useless

368
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:08,026
if you can't reach Maxim!

369
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:11,404
Now fall and face destruction
with the rest of Skypiea!

370
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,740
Say goodbye, boy!

371
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,950
[ENERU laughing]

372
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:19,037
[laughing continues]

373
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:31,633
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

374
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:36,805
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

375
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,557
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

376
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:44,354
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

377
00:22:47,941 --> 00:22:52,821
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

378
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,825
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

379
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

380
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:11,006
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

381
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,427
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

382
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,220
<i>they come to you</i>

383
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:22,684
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

384
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:28,565
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

385
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:35,280
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

386
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:43,121
[NAMI]
Listen, Luffy!

387
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,040
Make sure you end it this time!

388
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,042
[ENERU]
Disappear with this land!

389
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,293
[laughs]

390
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:49,794
[WYPER] No matter how
much of it you destroy,

391
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:51,504
this land will not be beaten!

392
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,298
[LUFFY]
What kind of god are you?

393
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm gonna ring that
bell no matter what!

394
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,678
[GAN FALL] Let me hear the
singing voice of the island.

395
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:00,513
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

396
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:02,223
"Miracle on Skypiea!

397
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,517
The Love Song
Heard in the Clouds!"

398
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,145
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
