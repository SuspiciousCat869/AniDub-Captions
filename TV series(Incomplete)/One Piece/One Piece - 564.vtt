WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.105
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.414
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.515
You can have it!

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.653
Now, you just have to find it!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.526
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.691
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.561
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:46.833
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.002
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.336
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.605
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.507
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.910
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:03:01.181
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.284
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:03:04.317 --> 00:03:05.919
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.589
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:13.726
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.831
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.634
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.705
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.074
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:33.379
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.315
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:36.916
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.220
and find themselves in the
midst of an all-out war!

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:41.854
After a change of plans,

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.224
Hordy threatens to
crush the entire island

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.793
under the weight
of a massive ship.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.764
[AMMO KNIGHT D] We've juist
been informed it's lost power.

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:53.566
As a result, it's
begun falling again,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.735
and it's hurtling
towards the island.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:59.973
Goodness, no!

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.775
He spoke earlier, and--

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.482
[FUKABOSHI]
It's clear now. Hordy is--

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.784
He's not a Fishman.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.121
He's a monster brought
to life by our hatred.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.123
The New Fishman Pirates,

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:20.960
they're nothing but remnants
of a grudge from ages past.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.097
[FUKABOSHI]
Answer me, damnit!

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.334
What did humans do to you
that was so unforgivable?

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:32.338
Why? What in this world
could inspire such cruelty?

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.743
Not one damn thing.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:37.977
[gasps]

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:46.486
The simple truth? We were chosen
by heaven to punish the humans.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:48.488
That is our purpose.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:55.094
[HORDY]
And we have the power to do so.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.364
All of their fury,
their hatred,

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:03.569
it doesn't come from
experience or logic or fact.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:05.872
They have no substance.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.611
[FUKABOSHI]
Just empty cruelty!

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.519
[LUFFY] "Back to Zero!
Earnest Wishes for Luffy!"

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:25.491
[FUKABOSHI]
Their hatred,

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:28.828
it doesn't come from
experience or logic or fact.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.897
They have no substance.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.298
Just empty cruelty!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.566
So now what?

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.502
I get what he's saying, but
how are they gonna stop them?

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:38.104
[FISHMAN B] Hey, what're
you standing around for?

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:40.206
We gotta get off
the island right now!

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.275
I can see the shadow
of the Noah already!

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.344
It's right over our heads!

00:05:58.491 --> 00:05:59.525
[AMMO KNIGHT B]
Keep your eyes peeled!

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:00.827
It's almost in range!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.295
[AMMO KNIGHT D]
I know that!

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:04.097
Our time is running out.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.833
How much inflation do we
have to work with right now?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.334
'Bout 87%!

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.738
Here it comes. Let's get ready!

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.478
[LUFFY]
Hurry, Weepyhoshi!

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:21.614
[laughing]

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.216
What's happening?

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:26.753
He looks even more
frightening than before!

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.856
[laughs]

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.260
[ARLONG] Humans are
worthless, evil creatures.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:36.696
Never forget that, Hordy.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:42.402
They're scum.
Barely fit to serve us.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.358
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H]
This is it, we're done for!

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.727
Ever since the Great
Pirate Era started,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.564
we've been losing more and
more of our people every day.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:15.067
The humans take the mermaids
to Sabaody and sell them off.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.437
Some of them went
missing this morning!

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.539
I'm telling you, it's
just a matter of time

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:22.041
before Fishman Island falls!

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.446
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE I]
Filthy humans!

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.015
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE J] We gotta
kill them before they kill us!

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:32.485
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE K] Yeah, we
can't leave a single one alive!

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:42.428
[ZEO]
Damn. Humans are the worst.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.964
Yeah, humans suck!

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:48.067
[IKAROS]
You got stronger, I see-hhi!

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.836
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Amazing!

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.905
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Fishman Island has a new hero!

00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:54.874
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE L]
Listen up!

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.342
This man sacrificed his life

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:59.412
to blow up the Human Shoppe
and set the slaves free!

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.880
Pay your respects!

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:05.918
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheering]

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.489
A hero, huh?

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.601
Serves 'em right. Stupid humans.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:22.935
[OTHERS]
Hm?

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.539
Ha! That guy's awesome!

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:27.840
[ZEO]
Sure is.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.176
Yeah, that's what
I wanna be-hhi!

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:31.377
Count me in.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.780
[chuckles]

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.316
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE M]
Have you heard the news?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.119
Arlong sank another
human pirate ship!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.225
Now, I'll tell you about those
wretched worms called humans.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.161
Ages ago, when they realized
that we, the Fishmen,

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:54.100
were the superior race,
they became jealous and afraid.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:59.906
And then... they began
to persecute our people.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:02.074
The human race plagued
the entire world,

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.809
like the vermin they are.

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:07.113
They used their numbers to gain
dominance over our people.

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.147
Then all of us Fishmen

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.384
were driven down here
to the sea floor.

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:15.054
Listen to me,
and don't forget this!

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.558
The humans know that they will
one day face retribution

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.827
for the wrongs they
have inflicted upon us!

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:26.132
We'll settle the score
and make them suffer.

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.774
Remember the plight
of our people.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.344
Let yourself feel the bitterness
of those who've passed on

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:41.914
and make their
resentment your own.

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:45.251
Hold fast to your anger.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.121
[chuckles]

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.957
There's this really nice
human named Rayleigh

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.125
I made friends with
on the surface.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.927
And he's not mean
like the rest are!

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.931
He doesn't even look that
disgusted when he sees me.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.033
Wait, Hordy!
Where are you going?

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:04.503
[HORDY] I don't like your
stupid stories, Hachi.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:06.706
They make me sick.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:09.475
[ARLONG]
Humans fear the Fishmen.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:13.946
You must keep the bitterness
of the dead alive, Hordy.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.182
Remember our past.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:20.019
The very existence of
humanity is pure evil.

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:22.722
You must hate them.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.657
Hate them.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.292
Hate them.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:28.160
Hate them!

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:35.067
[MERMAN A] This is terrible!
Tiger's been slain by humans!

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.203
The hero of the Fishmen is dead!

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.437
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE N]
No!

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:45.411
[ZEO] It seems Tiger was
not the hero we needed.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.932
[FISHMAN C] Who are you
people? What do you want?

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:10.269
[ZEO] Is it true you gave
your blood to humans?

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:14.040
So what if I did? He was
dying, I had to help hi--

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:18.444
[FISHMAN C screaming]

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:20.279
[MERBOY A]
Daddy!

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:33.159
[HORDY]
This whole country's mad,

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:35.594
right down to the royal family.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:38.064
The queen's looking to make
nice with the humans.

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.031
[DARUMA laughs]

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:40.966
How stupid can you be?

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.004
Jimbei, too.

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:47.673
Heard he joined the Seven
Warlords recently-hhi.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.508
[DOSUN] The Arlong Pirates
are the only ones

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.610
with any pride these days.

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.788
[HORDY]
We need a new kind of hero.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:03.656
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:05.057
Huh?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.863
[HORDY]
Someone who has no fear.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.766
Someone who can set
this country straight.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.239
[AMMO KNIGHT E]
Queen Otohime has been shot!

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.243
Ya see? The humans are evil!

00:12:24.276 --> 00:12:27.146
They would even stoop so
low as to kill the queen!

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:30.282
And after she's been
so kind to them!

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:31.984
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE O]
If the royal family is too meek

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.819
to hold the humans accountable,

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:36.589
then I can't be loyal to
this kingdom anymore!

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:37.957
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE P]
I don't wanna be ruled

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.259
by a bunch of cowards!

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.494
[ALL cheer]

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:45.297
The heavens have repaid that
spineless Otohime for bowing!

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.166
[DOSUN] Anyone who wants
to forgive humans

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.735
deserves a big dosun
to the head!

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:55.775
[ALL laughing]

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:08.220
[laughing continues]

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.091
I hope you're ready, boys.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.993
It's our time now.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:16.028
We've been chosen
by the heavens.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:18.697
Granted this unstoppable power.

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.634
Is that what I think it is?

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.702
Those are legendary-hhi!

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:26.405
How did you get
your hands on this?

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:29.008
You can duplicate
these, can't you?

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.910
[ZEO]
I'll try.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.645
[HORDY] The people of
the Fishman District

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:33.979
must come together.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.515
Our proud crusade
is about to begin.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.750
No mercy!

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:41.754
We'll kill as many humans as
we can, until the day we die.

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:44.023
This is our destiny.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:47.626
We've been chosen by heaven
to bring about the revolution.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.263
The day of reckoning is coming.

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:54.300
[HORDY laughs]

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.735
This is the end of the
road for all of you.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:59.205
We've been biding our
time for long enough!

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:01.373
Now we'll take our
revenge at last.

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.344
[HORDY laughs]

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.391
We could've stopped all this.

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:20.826
I see now.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.394
The royal family
turned their eyes

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.663
away from the Fishman District.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.632
In our negligence,
we allowed it to become

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:30.336
a breeding ground for
violence and hatred.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.271
We pretended not to
see the resentment

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.007
that built up as a result
of their isolation.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.976
Even as it descended
into lawlessness,

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:39.879
we lived in willful ignorance.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:42.147
Not so fast!
You goin' somewhere?

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.149
We have to run! The Noah--

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:45.384
I don't think so!

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.120
[FUKABOSHI] I thought collecting
those signatures would help,

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:51.724
but I wasn't addressing
the true issue.

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:53.959
Please forgive me, Mother.

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:55.261
I'm so sorry.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.563
I know it's difficult.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:59.465
But you can't pollute
the children's minds

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.166
with your anger towards humans.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.903
Your resentment,
do not make it theirs!

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.005
But it was too late!

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.806
Despite all her pleading,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.210
the thing she feared had
already been set in motion!

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.445
Oh, Fukaboshi.

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.381
[FUKABOSHI]
The real enemy

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:18.617
was the resentment brewing
inside our hearts.

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.153
I felt it, too. That hatred.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.489
But refusing to admit
that, I looked outward,

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:26.525
when I should've looked inward.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:30.529
My mother's true killer...
was the grudge that festered

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:34.199
among our people while
we turned a blind eye!

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.352
But it was too late!

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.688
Despite her pleading,
the thing she feared

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.190
had already been set in motion!

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:00.092
The real enemy

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.928
was the resentment brewing
inside our hearts.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.464
I felt it, too. That hatred.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.800
But refusing to admit that,
I looked outward,

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:10.736
when I should've looked inward.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:14.106
My mother's true killer...
was the grudge that festered

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:17.509
among our people while
we turned a blind eye!

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:22.014
And I believe she knew it
in that very moment!

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:26.051
My dear children, it doesn't
matter who hurt me.

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:30.823
Don't become angry.
Please, not on my behalf.

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:32.758
Don't submit to resentment.

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.893
Don't let hatred get
the better of you.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:38.163
In my name, or any other.

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.332
[FUKABOSHI]
I listened to my mother's words,

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:44.503
but part of me wasn't able
to let go of my anger.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:47.840
I couldn't help but hate
humans for killing her.

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:51.777
Me neither.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.580
[FUKABOSHI]
A person's pain dies with them.

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.882
A grudge is created
by the living,

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:01.754
and only the living
make it grow stronger.

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.622
Because of my prejudice,

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:07.393
I overlooked what was happening
in the Fishman District.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.928
And by the time I
came to my senses,

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:12.831
it was already spiraling
out of control!

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:14.867
[FISHMEN, MERFOLK screaming]

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.136
[FUKABOSHI]
If we don't do something soon,

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:19.538
the people of Fishman
Island will be done in

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:20.906
by their own hatred!

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:23.742
A foe more deadly
than any human!

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.046
[FISHBABY A cries]

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:33.218
This'll be tough, men. It's
not like the island's bubble.

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:35.487
It might shoot right
past the Noah!

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.523
[AMMO KNIGHT B] It needs to get
close enough to surround it--

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.558
no more, no less!

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:42.094
[FUKABOSHI]
Straw Hat! Please!

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:51.937
Erase our past!
Set us back to zero!

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.573
Eradicate the shadows
cast by our grudge

00:17:54.606 --> 00:17:56.942
so that we may see the light!

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.015
Okay. Get ready to fire!

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.450
I'm on it!

00:18:13.058 --> 00:18:14.726
[ALL]
Here we go!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.097
All we can do is start over!

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.832
We must!

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:27.406
Would you give it
a rest already?

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:30.676
The rage of our people
will never die!

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.583
Brother-hoshi.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:39.618
Just let me do this my way.

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.720
Trust me.

00:18:41.753 --> 00:18:42.955
[FISHMAN E]
Hey, wait a second!

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:45.958
Those guys fighting Hordy's crew
in the plaza, aren't they--?

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.726
[FISHMAN F]
Yeah. You're right.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:49.294
They're the Straw Hat Pirates!

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.096
[FISHMAN J]
And Boss Jimbei, too!

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.831
[FISHMAN K]
What?

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.533
[ICHIKA]
That's Luffy's voice!

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.968
[NIKA]
You're right!

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.519
[AMMO KNIGHT D]
We did it! It's in the bubble!

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:16.722
[ALL cheering]

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:20.425
[LUFFY] Our minds were made up
as soon as we got to the plaza.

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:24.596
With Jimbei's help, we were
gonna save this island!

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.765
Leave it to me and my crew!

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:37.042
That's what friends
are for, right?

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:54.092
[giggling]

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:58.297
[FISHMEN, MERFOLK cheering]

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:05.170
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT] We
should never have suspected him,

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.772
human or not!

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:10.742
What's the holdup? We should go!

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.148
Hurry up! Run!

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.217
I think I'm gonna stay here.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.484
What?

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:20.886
[MERMAID B]
Me, too!

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.688
[FISHMAN L]
Yeah. Same here!

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.523
[MERMAID C]
I am not running away!

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.891
[FISHMAN M]
Me neither!

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.563
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy! There's air on the Noah!

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:32.331
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.466
[laughs]

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.801
That may be,

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.470
but I'm going to catch you
long before you get there.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.072
What should we do, Luffy?

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:41.340
You'll be okay.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:42.341
Just follow my lead

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:44.476
and I promise I won't
let Hordy hurt you.

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:45.877
Yes! Right!

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.112
Huh?

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:58.357
Feeling brave?

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:01.860
Careful, Luffy!

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:06.732
That machine's no match
for the spirit of the squid!

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.736
[FRANKY]
Spirit?

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:16.808
[FRANKY]
That's not spirit!

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:19.011
That's just spit!

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:25.083
[FRANKY]
Huh? Ink?

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.152
[chuckles]

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:31.990
Fortunately-hhi, I can copy
myself with squid ink.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.427
The spirit of the
squid is unstop--

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.363
[FRANKY]
Franky Fireball!

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:41.233
[IKAROS] No! I don't
wanna be dried squid!

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:44.469
Wow! I didn't know your robot
could shoot fireballs!

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:47.105
How many cool attacks
can this baby do?

00:21:47.139 --> 00:21:49.408
[coughs]

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.075
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.643
Wait, that came outta you?!

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.746
You really shouldn't have
let your guard down, little guy!

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.114
Yeah, like I would!
Weight Point!

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.283
T-shot!

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.519
Heavy Gong!

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:06.158
Who uses their bare hand
to stop a hammer?

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.563
On second thought,

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:14.566
I probably coulda found a
less painful way to do that.

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.834
Hey, Chopper!

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:18.770
I thought that one was supposed
to be your normal-looking form.

00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:20.772
Sure you're okay
lookin' so freaky?

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:21.640
[CHOPPER laughs]

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:22.941
I don't care anymore.

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:25.077
I wanted to look human before

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.346
because I didn't
have any friends.

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:30.982
But now, I wanna be a
monster so I can help Luffy!

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:32.250
Gotcha.

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.253
[HYOUZOU] I'll slice that
smile right off your face!

00:22:35.287 --> 00:22:38.190
[HYOUZOU yells]

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.830
[ZORO] Bring me the real
strongest swordsman

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.798
on Fishman Island.

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:52.537
There's no way it's you.
I didn't even break a sweat.

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.740
Got you now!

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.608
[laughs]

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:59.611
Sorry, but your time is up!

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.583
Did you hear a word that I said?

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:09.254
I'm gonna save them all, from
you and anything you've got!

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:16.128
[NARRATOR] The battle against
the New Fishman Pirates

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:19.064
races towards its climax
in Conchorde Plaza.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.766
Meanwhile, in the open sea,

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:24.436
Hordy mercilessly pummels
Luffy in a fit of rage.

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:27.672
However, Luffy is determined to
keep his promise to Fukaboshi

00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.641
and unleashes his
most deadly attack

00:23:29.674 --> 00:23:32.611
in hopes of finishing the
battle before it's too late.

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:34.346
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:37.549
"Luffy's All-Out Attack!
Red Hawk Blasts!"

00:23:37.582 --> 00:23:40.152
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
