00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.978
And I promise you that
your home will be fixed.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:20.713
Whatever it takes.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.583
Sorry, Vice Admiral Vergo.

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.290
[TASHIGI]
Excuse me, sir.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.591
Vice Admiral.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.528
About that child abduction
report from the other day.

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:36.529
Oh, yes.

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:38.431
I ordered some men
to look into it.

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.900
Seems as though it was
an accident at sea.

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.601
Another false report.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:44.470
Why would they...

00:11:44.503 --> 00:11:46.405
[VERGO] It's difficult
for any parent to accept

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.507
the death of their child.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.243
But, calling it an
abduction gives them

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.479
some hope they're still alive.

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.016
[VERGO]
You'll understand yourself.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:00.586
Someday, when you
become a mother.

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:03.923
So that's really
all there is to it?

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:07.226
Yes, that's all there is to it.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.199
[TASHIGI]
Everyone, get back!

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.533
Run for your lives!

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.503
He's not the man
you think he is!

00:12:17.536 --> 00:12:18.771
Listen to me!

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:21.507
He's been working against--

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.909
--[JERO gasps]
--Captain, no!

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:26.946
[JERO]
Captain!

00:12:28.981 --> 00:12:30.850
This guy's an impostor!

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.251
The real Vergo would never

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:35.621
attack his own
soldiers like this!

00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.556
Pike's right! It's a disguise!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.158
Or a Devil Fruit power!

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.192
You bastard!

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:43.562
How dare you pretend
to be Vice Admiral Vergo!

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.830
[VERGO]
Hmph.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:46.966
The Vice Admiral us guys know,

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:49.502
he's a man of honor who
always stands up for us!

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.504
Even if we're
a bunch of misfits!

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.539
And he believes in justice!

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.007
There's no way you're him!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.342
Ya damn phony!

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.777
Let's kick his ass backwards!

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.879
Eat this!

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:01.380
[JERO groans]

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:11.056
Monster! I'm sending
you to hell!

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.691
[PIKE screams]

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.427
[MARINES groan]

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:29.208
[TASHIGI] My words are
frozen in my throat.

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:33.045
Smoker. Anyone.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:36.348
Please, you have to stop this.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.597
[SANJI]
I hear a lady...

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.098
Who is that?

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.769
[SANJI]
...in need of my help!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.104
[VERGO groans]

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.738
Wait, is that...?

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.673
Hey. Ain't that guy a Straw Hat?

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:37.076
Why's a pirate helpin' us?

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:52.124
I heard the heartbreaking
sound... of a woman's tears.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.140
Why do you think Sanji took off
in a mad dash like that?

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.609
I felt the presence of
someone dangerous creeping up--

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:11.977
He must've gone after them.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.045
He'll catch up.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.948
[ROBIN gasps] Wait.
Something's coming this way.

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.017
Ah, what now?

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.552
That's the dragon we
didn't ride here on!

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.422
Is it? He looks
different somehow.

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.391
[BROOK]
Different? What do you mean?

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.927
[DRAGON A roars]

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.194
The look in his eyes.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:32.431
That's a telltale sign that
the sedatives have worn off.

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.732
It was drugged up?

00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:37.636
Yeah. Dragons are
pretty savage by nature.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.204
The only way to
control the beasts

00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:41.106
is pump 'em full of sedatives.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.975
And the smaller ones like him

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:45.277
are the newer,
more advanced models.

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.547
So he's even faster and
tougher than the others.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.083
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.685
Damn! Gotta speed things up!

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.853
[DRAGON A roars]

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.957
[BROOK]
A little faster, please!

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:06.065
[LUFFY yelling]

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:13.672
[LUFFY yelling]

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:17.443
Not fair! You're not
beatin' me there!

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.545
[SMOKER]
Hey, Straw Hat.

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.847
What're you such in
a hurry to get to?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.050
I'm gonna rearrange Caesar's
face! Where're you goin'?

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.952
Gonna straighten out
Vergo with my fists.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.053
That's cool with me.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.488
He's not with Caesar, is he?

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:30.689
Probably is.

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:32.591
Try to stay outta my way.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:35.928
[LUFFY] Wait, you bastard!
Stay away from Caesar!

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:40.966
[thudding]

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.272
[MOCHA]
Let me out!

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:48.907
I'm so scared!

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.510
Help me, please!

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:54.480
I wanna go!

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:57.516
[SUBORDINATE C] All right,
c'mon. Back away from the door.

00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:58.550
[SUBORDINATE A]
Yeah. Don't you wanna

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.019
be with all your friends?

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:03.155
If you come with us,
you can have some candy.

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:06.592
[SUBORDINATE B] That's right!
So let's go to the Biscuit Room.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.932
Please, nice lady! Come get me!

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.434
I don't wanna be here!

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.603
I've gotta find my way
through this maze of a lab

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.872
if I'm ever gonna
rescue those poor kids.

00:17:19.905 --> 00:17:23.042
[MOCHA]
Open up, let me go!

00:17:23.075 --> 00:17:24.309
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:26.478
What's one of the kids
doing up here?

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.213
[MOCHA]
Let me out!

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.548
[SUBORDINATE B]
That's enough, pipe down!

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:31.483
[SUBORDINATE A] Keep it up,
brat, and I'll shoot you!

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:33.118
Time for Heavy Point!

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.187
Get away from her!

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.855
[SUBORDINATE C gasps]
Who's that?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:37.756
[SUBORDINATE B]
Don't move!

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.358
[SUBORDINATE A]
Just shoot 'im!

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:45.931
[SUBORDINATES groan]

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.534
Hey, are you okay?

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:57.309
[screams] Another monster! Help!

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:59.244
She must be going
through withdrawal.

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:00.012
Calm down!

00:18:00.045 --> 00:18:02.181
No!

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.584
Oh, yeah! I've got sedatives!

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.320
This should ease her pain.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.189
I hope it works quickly.

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:12.157
You're gonna feel better!

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:15.961
[MOCHA]
Someone help me, please!

00:18:15.994 --> 00:18:17.963
[gasps]

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.165
[CHOPPER]
That's a good girl!

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:22.301
There, all done!

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:27.239
Hang on, it's gotta kick in.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.143
Uh, hello.

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.078
Do you know what I'm doing here?

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.781
[CHOPPER] Well, you were
just pounding on this door.

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:38.550
Oh, yeah. That's right.

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:40.486
I was trying to escape, I think.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:43.522
Hey, you're one of the kids
we got out of here, right?

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:45.457
So what are you doing
back in the lab?

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:46.859
They brought us here.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:49.595
The Master found us with
your friends and he hurt them

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.330
and he put me and
all my other friends

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:53.599
on his Flying Gas Balloon.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:54.800
Oh, wait.

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:56.468
I remember your friends.

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.538
They told us not to
come back with the Master.

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:00.539
Of course they did!

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.040
What happened to the other kids?

00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:04.676
All the sheep men were taking
them back to the Biscuit Room

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.111
so they could eat some candy.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.846
They what? Oh, no!

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.781
We can't let them
eat that candy!

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:10.516
Why?

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:11.350
[CHOPPER]
It's bad stuff!

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.518
[gasps]

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:14.987
[CHOPPER]
Okay.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.256
I need to get to that
Biscuit Room right away.

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:18.524
Can you take me there?

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.627
I can! I even know a shortcut
to get there fast.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.196
C'mon, it's this way, follow me!

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.037
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Look at this! What the hell

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.106
does Vergo think he's doing?

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:37.509
I made it clear those G-5
guys are my test subjects!

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:39.478
That idiot's not
supposed to kill them!

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.979
Land of the Dead is!

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.447
What a damn waste!

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:43.949
I have no choice.

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:47.319
Close the doors and seal off
the passage ahead of them,

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:50.556
and then open up the other
gates to let the gas in!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.693
Sure, but do you want me to do
that with Vergo still inside?

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:57.629
Just do it! He shouldn't
have gone rogue on me!

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.531
It's his own fault!

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.610
We're almost at the
Biscuit Room! It's that way!

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:12.945
Let's keep movin'!

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:13.812
[MOCHA]
Mm!

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:15.647
[KONBU]
Aren't we close enough now?

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.950
[SYND]
I just want the candy!

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:20.552
Not good! That's the other kids!

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.155
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:29.127
[CHOPPER] We can't let them
get past this door! Mocha!

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:32.531
If you wanna save your friends,
you've gotta help me!

00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:34.032
I can try!

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:36.868
Hang on! I've got an idea!

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:42.107
[KONBU] Is that you
in there, Mocha? Let us in!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.677
[SYND] Yeah, the candies
are in the Biscuit Room!

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.745
[CHOPPER]
Listen to me!

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:49.381
No matter what happens,
we can't let them in here!

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:50.249
[MOCHA]
Right!

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.783
[KONBU]
Open the door!

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:52.684
Hey!

00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:54.453
Huh?

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:59.958
You said the candy is bad,
but what makes it bad?

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.396
It just is.

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:11.737
[LUFFY panting]

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.071
You ready?

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.439
[LUFFY]
Are you serious?

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.475
Gimme a sec! Jeez!

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:21.546
I was running so fast my feet
lit the damn floor on fire!

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.882
You think that's easy?

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.217
I'm not like you!

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.287
I can't just go flying
on a smoke cloud!

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.788
[SMOKER]
Are you ready now?

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.423
[LUFFY]
I just told you to wait!

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.892
I'll tell you when
I'm ready, okay?

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:39.564
[pants] I'm starting
to catch my breath.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.001
Huh? Hey, did you hear me
say I was ready?

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:46.872
Listen up. Vergo's
mine, stay back.

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:48.874
Yeah! I got it!

00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:50.942
And you keep away from Caesar.

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:53.945
I'm the only one
taking down that jerk.

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:00.585
Oh. Guess I'm up first.

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:01.453
Fine.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:02.321
Huh?

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:08.293
You're not gettin'
away now! Caesar!

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:11.630
[CAESAR CLOWN groans]

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.671
[NARRATOR] The fateful rematch
against Caesar Clown

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.239
is finally underway.

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.709
Caesar previously used
his Gas-Gas power

00:22:23.742 --> 00:22:25.410
to defeat the Straw Hat crew.

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:28.146
But the stalwart Luffy fights
back with all his might,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.048
which causes this
decisive battle

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.284
to grow ever more intense.

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:33.952
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.985 --> 00:22:37.489
"A Fierce Battle Gets Heated!
Luffy vs. Caesar!"

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.359
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
