1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,804
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,606
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,343
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,654
It's all right, Robin.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,689
We'll be fine.

6
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,226
I understand what's going on.

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,797
You're still hiding
something from us, aren't you?

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,435
There's one last thing,
you can do what you want

9
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:38,138
but a pirate...

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,709
...isn't allowed to
leave their crew,

11
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:45,378
unless they have their
captain's permission.

12
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:55,355
So no matter what, you
can always believe in Luffy.

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,561
Dumb frog!

14
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,429
Gero!

15
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,598
Poor kid.

16
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,234
It's been eight years now.

17
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,771
Eight long years since
Tom was taken away from us.

18
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,440
I've watched you challenge
the sea train every day

19
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:16,110
since then again and again.

20
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,779
You were trying to get
stronger, weren't you?

21
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,616
So you won't ever have to lose
the ones you love ever again.

22
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,586
So you'll have the
power to protect them.

23
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,521
Don't cry.

24
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,455
Now's the time for you

25
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,392
to put that training
to the test big boy.

26
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,427
Gero?

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,697
Anyway, we're in trouble now.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,767
The government's got
exactly what they want.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,168
The only woman with the know-how

30
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,604
to bring back an ancient weapon

31
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,740
and the man with the only
known blueprints for one.

32
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,809
Don't that beat all.

33
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,680
But still, there's no point in
me making it out of here alone.

34
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,784
You gotta find some way to get
back to Straw Hat, all right?

35
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,153
I can't.

36
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,721
If I'm with them, it will
only bring them suffering.

37
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,292
Those government
bastards may tell you

38
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,261
that your existence is a crime,

39
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,730
but no matter how
dangerous you may be,

40
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:16,036
just being alive, just being
who you are is never wrong.

41
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,372
There's no right or
wrong in who you are.

42
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,776
Open the main gate!

43
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,718
Huh?

44
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,752
Whoa!

45
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,754
What the hell is
this crazy place?

46
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,132
A waterfall?

47
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
What?

48
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,311
I can't see the bottom!

49
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,279
You sure are a noisy one.

50
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,022
It looks like Lucci and the
others are headed this way.

51
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,892
And they've brought me

52
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:18,164
the best souvenir I could
ever possibly wish for.

53
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,516
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

54
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,118
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

55
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,263
We gotta hurry!

56
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:32,098
Can't you bulls go any faster?

57
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,614
So big bro Franky sacrificed
himself to save you guys?

58
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,648
And now he's--?

59
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,549
Yeah.

60
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,517
That's right.

61
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,521
He was trying to rescue Robin
and help us escape with her.

62
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,330
Our Big Bro is such
a kind-hearted guy!

63
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,199
We need to hurry or
we won't make it in time.

64
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,669
Look!

65
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,471
The lights of the
"Nightless Island"!

66
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,772
It's Enies Lobby!

67
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,308
Really?

68
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,509
I can't believe we made it!

69
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,810
All right!

70
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,312
Now we can rescue bro!

71
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,115
"Nightless Island"?

72
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:21,949
Yeah!

73
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,751
The sun never
stops shining there.

74
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,019
So it's "nightless".

75
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:29,089
They sometimes call the Judicial
Island a "Daytime Island", too.

76
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,124
Is that so?

77
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,296
We found them!

78
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,398
The giant yagaras!

79
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,534
Ahoy!

80
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,272
Luffy!

81
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,708
Hey! Sanji!

82
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,444
And--Who the heck it that?

83
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:56,716
It's Straw Hat!

84
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,787
Looks like we
caught up with 'em.

85
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,088
No problem.

86
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,456
Well, now that
we've found the others.

87
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,725
It's time for our date
with the World Government!

88
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,561
Hell yeah, it is!

89
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,267
Okay! This is it!

90
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,469
Now approaching Enies Lobby!

91
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,370
All hands!

92
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,539
Get ready for a showdown!

93
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:23,143
Yeah!!!

94
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,551
At last.

95
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,055
After five long years,
the time has finally come

96
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,759
for all eight members
of CP9, to be reunited.

97
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,528
This should be a
time of celebration.

98
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,432
But instead I'll ask,
"What's the meaning of this?"

99
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,503
Your orders were to assassinate
the leaders of the revolution!

100
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,705
But according to this article,
not only did you

101
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,408
kill those three, but
twenty others, as well!

102
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,375
What happened?

103
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,544
If you have an excuse,
I'd like to hear it!

104
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,213
Yoyoi!

105
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:03,350
My most sincere apologies
and pardons, Chief!

106
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,486
Everything is entirely,

107
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,224
unreservedly,
completely, my fault!

108
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,659
Stop that, Kumadori!

109
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,762
A real man doesn't bow
his head to anybody!

110
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,231
I'll explain everything
that happened to the Chief,

111
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:19,266
so shut up and get
a hold of yourself!

112
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,367
Yoyoi!

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,303
I can't apologize enough!

114
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:28,108
And so if need be I'll shoulder
the blame by taking my own life!

115
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,443
Don't be so melodramatic!

116
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,143
Yoyoi!

117
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,445
It happened like this, Chief.

118
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,047
We followed the
plan to the letter.

119
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,981
We infiltrated their forces

120
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,816
and were all ready
for the assassination.

121
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,253
But somehow the enemy managed
to find out about our plans!

122
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,387
Probably 'cause I was talking

123
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,557
about them all over
town, Chapapa!

124
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,558
You again?

125
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,692
What's wrong with you?

126
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,461
And what's the point in
having a zipper on your mouth

127
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,396
if it you don't even
use the damn thing?

128
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,831
This little blabbermouth problem

129
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,600
of yours has got
to stop, understand?

130
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,467
We're secret agents!

131
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,535
We've got secrets to keep!

132
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,037
I didn't do it on
purpose, Chapapa!

133
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,339
Don't you "Chapapa" me!

134
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,507
Can't do anything
about it now, Chapapa!

135
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,345
There's no need
to blame Fukurou!

136
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,148
I will take full responsibility!

137
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:12,453
Seppuku! Iron Body!

138
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:15,189
I can't even die right!

139
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,191
Oh just get it over
with, you bastard!

140
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,159
You'd be doing everyone a favor!

141
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,294
I accidentally talked
about it, Chapapa!

142
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,562
Shut up!

143
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,263
Enough.

144
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,431
I understand.

145
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,599
Hot, hot, hot!

146
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,769
I spilt my coffee again, dammit!

147
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,772
Oh, by the way, I heard
Nero didn't work out.

148
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,473

For real?

164
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:00,761
That's right!

165
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,563
I'm a close friend of Usopp's.

166
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:03,731
I'm here because he asked me

167
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,133
to aid you on this
perilous journey!

168
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,168
He's a super hero!

169
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,235
I knew it!

170
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,472
I could totally tell
'cause of the mask and cape!

171
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,139
Amazing!

172
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,141
I've never seen one before!

173
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,144
So wearing a mask and cape
means he has super powers?

174
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,178
'Course!

175
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,214
Everybody in a mask
and cape is a super hero!

176
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,081
Really?

177
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:21,581
Well, yeah!

178
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,816
Isn't that Usopp?

179
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,319
I'm glad you're safe, Usopp.

180
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,756
That's the long-nose guy that
busted into the Franky House.

181
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,759
That's the guy that got
taken away with bro.

182
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,559
Totally.

183
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,594
No question.

184
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,562
It's-- It's nice to meet you!

185
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,663
Likewise.

186
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,565
That's one of the guys
we met at the Shift Station.

187
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,433
Meow!

188
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,568
Can I have your autograph?

189
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,202
Sure.

190
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,441
But that makes me
wonder--Where did Usopp go?

191
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,275
He's safe.

192
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,444
There's no need
to worry about him.

193
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,813
Anyway, he told me the most
important thing right now

194
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,215
is saving your friend Robin.

195
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,216
Then he left.

196
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,084
Yep.

197
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,586
He's absolutely right.

198
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:03,424
So, uh--So where exactly
is this Sniper Island?

199
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,459
I'll tell you.

200
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:09,763
♪ Oh, the wind
carries my name. ♪

201
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:13,601
It's inside of your heart.

202
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:14,468
Wow!

203
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,770
♪ From Sniper Island. ♪

204
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,507
♪ Far away. ♪

205
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,409
Seriously. Where?

206
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,160
♪ Oh, the wind
carries my name! ♪

207
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,530
♪ From Sniper Island,
far away. ♪

208
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,331
Sing it!

209
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,600
♪ From Sniper Island, far
away! ♪

210
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,801
Hey, Nami.

211
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,036
Huh?

212
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,572
Yeah? What is it?

213
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,573
Just a second.

214
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,075
The rest of you idiots
should hear this, too.

215
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,777
Before we go to rescue Robin--

216
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,115
There's something
you need to know.

217
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:10,156
If there's a Buster Call,
you'll be obliterated.

218
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,406
Long ago, an island was erased.

219
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,175
Five vice admirals
and ten battleships

220
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,178
are a terrifying force
for anyone to behold.

221
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,181
But for a child to see
them destroy her home,

222
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,618
well, it's nothing
short of a nightmare.

223
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,454
Those thoughts have
haunted her for years

224
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,257
and now that her old
nightmare bares its fangs

225
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,494
at her companions she no longer
has the will to resist us.

226
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,396
You bastards!

227
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,300
You knew and you used that.

228
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,435
Of course we did.

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,125
So there you have it.

230
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:20,094
Those CP9 guys
are controlling Robin

231
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:23,664
by using her childhood
fears against her.

232
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,067
I'm not making excuses for
not being able to save her.

233
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,236
I just wanted to make it clear
that even if we march in

234
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,338
to get her back, it doesn't
necessarily mean

235
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,774
that she'll be willing
to return with us.

236
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,178
No.

237
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,580
It's over.

238
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:46,253
This is the last
time you'll see me.

239
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,222
None of that matters!

240
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:51,524
I won't stand for this!

241
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,794
Damn Robin!

242
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,429
It's not her fault!

243
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,730
Of course it is, Nami!

244
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,632
Why doesn't she
want us to rescue her?

245
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,599
It doesn't make sense!

246
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,867
Because she doesn't
wanna feel responsible

247
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,138
for all the awful things that'll
happen to our crew once we do!

248
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,606
I don't care about all that!

249
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,442
If we don't rescue her, she's
gonna be killed, isn't she?

250
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,211
There's no way she wants to die,
so we're gonna save her!

251
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,480
Well of course she doesn't
want to die, but still!

252
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,414
Let it go.

253
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:18,085
This doesn't change
what we have to do.

254
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,587
We'll save her either way.

255
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,656
I'm gonna beat up
every last one of them!

256
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,226
There's a new move I wanna try!

257
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,666
Hey, guys, take a look at this.

258
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,700
I came to this island once

259
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:37,471
before to do some
maintenance on the railway.

260
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,573
I drew this from what
I could remember.

261
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,544
It's a rough sketch of the
overall layout of Enies Lobby.

262
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:51,285
The Gates of Justice are located
at the back of the island.

263
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,787
The only way to get to them
is through the Tower of Law.

264
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,357
What's that big black thing?

265
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,158
It represents the waterfall.

266
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,093
Huh?

267
00:15:59,126 --> 00:15:59,793
Yeah.

268
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:02,096
Once we're inside, you'll see.

269
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,198
If we don't rescue
Franky and Nico Robin

270
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,666
before they pass
through the Main Gate

271
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,135
and into the Gates of
Justice, then that's it.

272
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,270
It's over.

273
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,604
And why's that?

274
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,838
It doesn't matter
where they take her to,

275
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,742
we'll just keep on fighting
them until we get Robin back!

276
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,645
I explained this before
we left Water 7, remember?

277
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,080
Once we pass that gate,
the only two places

278
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,616
we can go are Navy Headquarters
or the deep-sea prison.

279
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,850
No matter what happens,

280
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:26,787
we have to settle this before
they reach those rear gates.

281
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,689
Yep. Pretty much.

282
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,756
On top of that,

283
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,426
even if we all rushed the
island at the same time,

284
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:36,430
the only ones capable of going
up against those CP9 guys--

285
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,198
--are you Straw Hats.

286
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,168
After seeing what you can do,
I know how strong you are.

287
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,772
That's why I think you should
stay behind once we get there.

288
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,906
Give us five minutes,

289
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,676
then charge through to the
main island in Rocketman.

290
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,811
The Franky Family and
Galley-La will go in first

291
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,079
and break open the Main Gate

292
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:55,382
and the Main Island Front Gate
so the train can pass through.

293
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,217
I'm sure we'll suffer
a lot of casualties,

294
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,720
but remember: Once you're in,
keep going no matter what.

295
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:02,022
Don't look back.

296
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,792
We've only got a
little over 60 people.

297
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,061
The enemy forces
probably have somewhere

298
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:09,063
between 2 and 3 thousand.

299
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:11,198
Our best chance for victory
is for you Straw Hats

300
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:15,536
to concentrate on CP9 and leave
the rest of the marines to us.

301
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,370
Right, I got it.

302
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:18,772
Okay, folks!

303
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:22,176
We're pulling up to
the front of the island!

304
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,513
While we're here, take a look
at the sky behind Enies Lobby.

305
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,414
Behold!

306
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,750
The Gates of Justice.

307
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,785
Whoa!

308
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:35,155
That's huge!

309
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,495
It's not a good idea
to open them all the way.

310
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:43,597
When it comes time to
send a criminal through,

311
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,834
they only unlatch them
just enough to let 'em pass.

312
00:17:46,867 --> 00:17:49,403
Behind that gate are
some big sea kings.

313
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,039
That part of the sea is
a lot like the Calm Belt:

314
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,376
An eerie body of water cutting
right through the Grand Line.

315
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,611
No normal ship would
dare to sail there.

316
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,780
They'd be lost forever.

317
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,216
I don't know how
they managed to do it,

318
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,452
but somehow the Navy figured out
a way to make it through safely.

319
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,589
In other words, it's
like the pirate girl said:

320
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,190
You can't take
back a criminal once

321
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,458
they pass through those gates.

322
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,396
Any chance of a rescue is gonna
have to happen before they open.

323
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,330
Go!

324
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,131
Hop to it!

325
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:19,232
There's no time to lose!

326
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,403
We'll head in first
and clear a path for you,

327
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,637
just like we planned!

328
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,806
Give 'em hell, Straw Hats!

329
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,074
Hey!

330
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,142
You two over there!

331
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,577
Aren't you supposed
to be with us?

332
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,748
Hm?

333
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,784
Wait, where's Luffy?

334
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:37,484
Huh?

335
00:18:37,518 --> 00:18:39,553
He was here just a second ago.

336
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:48,362
Look!

337
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,730
Isn't that Straw Hat?

338
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,503
What?

339
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,206
Why the hell is he
going in on his own?

340
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:03,243
That crazy Straw Hat didn't
understand the plan at all!

341
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,213
There goes our strategy.

342
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,349
He said "Right! I
got it", didn't he?

343
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,385
He's really not the
wait-five-minutes type.

344
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,186
Damn. Should have known.

345
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,790
He's an impatient one, isn't he?

346
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,092
Yeah!

347
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,560
Go, Mister Pirate!

348
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,694
Meow!

349
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,230
Gero, gero!

350
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,764
Too late now!

351
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:24,565
Let's move!

352
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,800
Sodom! Gomorrah!

353
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,304
Jump over that iron fence and
then break open the main gate!

354
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,544
Yeah!

355
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,753
Gum Gum--Rocket!

356
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,424
What the--?

357
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,459
Something just flew over!

358
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,097
Whoa!

359
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,565
What's up with this place?

360
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,134
What a huge hole!

361
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,070
It looks like the island's
floating or something!

362
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,672
I see a town, too!

363
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,739
Huh.

364
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,108
I wonder if Robin is down there.

365
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,714
There's someone up
on the flagpole!

366
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,217
Shoot him down
before he gets away!

367
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,784
Whoops!

368
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,720
Guess they spotted me!

369
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,558
He went inside the main gate!

370
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,660
Get back here!

371
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:31,065
This is the Main Gate!
This is the Main Gate!

372
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,166
I have an urgent message

373
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,602
for the Chief Officer at
the Main Island Front Gate!

374
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,769
This is the Main Gate!

375
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,305
It's an emergency!

376
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,707
This is Spandam.

377
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,941
What's going on?

378
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:43,177
An intruder somehow managed
to pass through the Main Gate

379
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,479
and is heading toward
the Main Island, sir!

380
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,313
One intruder?

381
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,215
That's what all
this fuss is about?

382
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,084
Surely you can manage
to take care of him.

383
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:50,751
But, sir!

384
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:51,819
You don't understand, it's--

385
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,387
This is the Main
Island Front Gate.

386
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,356
Intruder sighting confirmed.

387
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,223
Don't worry.

388
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:57,791
We'll take care of
things from here.

389
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,762
Hey there, buddy!

390
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:02,796
That's far enough!

391
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,532
Do you have the slightest
idea where you are?

392
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,234
Don't take this guy lightly!

393
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,537
Unless my eyes deceive me,
then I'm pretty sure that he's--

394
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,440
The pirate Straw Hat Luffy!

395
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:19,880
What?

396
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:20,814
What was that you just said?

397
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:24,518
The man with the
100 million berry bounty!

398
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,819
It is him!

399
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,721
Straw Hat Luffy!

400
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,695
Where's Robin?

401
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,447
Tell me where
Robin is right now!

402
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:15,362
I'm afraid Straw Hat Luffy has
entered the main island, sir!

403
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,196
What?

404
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,065
Why the hell did
you let him do that?

405
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:19,566
What's going on over there?

406
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,800
Get out of my way!

407
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,804
Any idiot should know what it
means to attack Enies Lobby!

408
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,806
And if they don't,
we'll have to teach them!

409
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,708
We're coming, Robin!

410
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,310
On the next One Piece:

411
00:23:29,343 --> 00:23:30,644
"Luffy Cuts Through!

412
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,280
Big Showdown on
the Judicial Island!"

413
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,482
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
