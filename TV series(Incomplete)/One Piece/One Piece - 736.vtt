00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.463
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.902
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.276
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:52.979
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.384
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.557
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.498
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.101
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.243
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:12.552
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.031
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:21.704
and launched an attack
on the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:24.475
who had a firm grip on
the Kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:26.513
In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.216
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.320
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.424
until at last...

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.931
All right. King Kong...

00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:38.269
[yells]

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.808
...Gun!

00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.339
[NARRATOR]
Luffy defeats Doflamingo!

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.146
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:02.484
Come back to the throne.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:06.527
King of Miracles,
Riku Doldo the Third.

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:10.868
[FUJITORA] You friend's
a smart man there, King Riku.

00:04:21.923 --> 00:04:25.097
This entire mess is
Doflamingo's doing.

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:28.036
I would hate to see you shoulder
the responsibility alone

00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:30.207
for the error in his judgment.

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:33.213
That crooked pirate
was unfit to rule,

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:34.516
but thanks to a
broken arrangement

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.252
with bunch of convicts,

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.557
the Seven Warlord
System failed you.

00:04:38.658 --> 00:04:41.195
Sadly, Dressrosa was
forced to pay this price.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:42.999
By the blood-stained hands

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.804
of us! The World Government.

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:49.779
[FUJITORA]
People of the kingdom,

00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:54.388
and members of the royal family.

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:04.842
[FUJITORA]
On behalf of the Government,

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:10.621
allow me to offer my
most humble of apologies.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.911
With deep regret.

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.983
We've done you
a terrible disservice.

00:05:28.524 --> 00:05:29.926
[LUFFY]
"Sending a Shock Wave!

00:05:30.026 --> 00:05:33.099
The Worst Generation
Goes Into Action!"

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.400
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:01.623
Th-The Navy Admiral's
bowing to King Riku?

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.694
[TOWNSMAN B]
Wow, they're recording it, too!

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:10.373
[APPLENINE gasping]

00:06:10.473 --> 00:06:13.379
Hey! Look! That guy's
an admiral, right?

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.749
No way!

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.485
[APPLENINE C]
This is a big deal!

00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:18.724
Something really nuts
happened in Dressrosa!

00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.167
Please raise your head, Admiral.

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:31.181
Fujitora?

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:43.507
Come on now, do you truly wish
for the world to see this?

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:52.591
[DOLDO]
My word! Don't tell me...

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:56.465
[DOLDO] Is this why you
did not engage Doflamingo?

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:02.211
Fujitora!

00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:05.551
It was about time the world
found out the truth.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:06.987
So, I took one mighty gamble

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:08.991
and let them do
all the fighting.

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:11.329
It was what was
needed to be done.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.132
How could we let that Warlord do

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.304
whatever he pleased
for all those years

00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:18.811
then swoop in here and
start preaching about justice?

00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:20.480
It doesn't sit right with me.

00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:22.852
We can't play hero
for a problem we made.

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:31.269
[FUJITORA] What we
witnessed today was a kingdom

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:34.474
that came together and
seized its own justice.

00:07:35.376 --> 00:07:37.047
You should be thanking
the courageous actions

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:40.587
of pirates, gladiators,
and your citizens.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:48.169
[snoring]

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:53.479
[USOPP]
Hey! Luffy!

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:57.555
Where are ya, buddy?

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:01.930
[USOPP]
Zoro!

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.734
[KIN'EMON]
Oh! Hello, Sir Usopp!

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.905
[USOPP]
You're all okay! You hear?

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:08.343
Luffy knocked the lights
outta Doflamingo!

00:08:08.443 --> 00:08:09.846
--I heard.
--I mean,

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:11.348
everything worked out
just like I planned,

00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:12.518
so it's no surprise.

00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:14.188
Huh?

00:08:14.288 --> 00:08:16.125
I'm delighted you've regained
your ability to walk!

00:08:16.225 --> 00:08:17.862
Yeah, you bet!

00:08:17.962 --> 00:08:19.966
As soon as Luffy won, I got
all of my power back, instantly!

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.772
[laughs]

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.209
That's SUPER!

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.247
[screams]

00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:31.356
[FRANKY chuckles] That was
a super victory for us, too!

00:08:31.456 --> 00:08:32.525
[USOPP]
Don't scare me like that,

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.629
ya no-pants-wearing robo-perv!

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:36.634
[FRANKY]
Whoa, don't talk me up so much!

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:38.102
[USOPP]
I didn't!

00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.505
--[FRANKY] Got me blushin'!
--[USOPP] What?

00:08:39.606 --> 00:08:40.908
[FRANKY]
It's a robot thing.

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:45.283
It's time we let them
know Straw Hat's here.

00:08:45.383 --> 00:08:46.719
Don't you think?

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:49.625
[REBECCA]
Mm-hmm.

00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:04.121
Splendid work.
The arduous battle is over.

00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:11.435
[KYROS] You are all quite
remarkable warriors.

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:12.738
I am so proud.

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:15.944
I thank you all.

00:09:18.784 --> 00:09:20.954
I know it's been difficult.

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:23.761
Anti-Doflamingo Force.

00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:25.597
Little King Riku Army!

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:27.735
Yes, sir, Commander?

00:09:28.737 --> 00:09:31.677
Your operation is now complete!

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:33.847
So, from this day forward...

00:09:42.363 --> 00:09:43.934
...we're disbanded!

00:09:45.136 --> 00:09:48.375
[DWARVES]
Commander!

00:09:48.476 --> 00:09:50.814
Commander!

00:10:15.196 --> 00:10:19.505
Be proud, little warden
deities of Dressrosa.

00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:21.843
[DWARVES gasp]

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.717
Although you're
small in stature,

00:10:25.817 --> 00:10:27.187
your courage is unmatched.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.639
[KYROS]
I am humbled by your bravery.

00:10:43.787 --> 00:10:46.492
Though our battalion
will be dissolved today,

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:50.132
it would seem we still have
much work to tend to.

00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.876
[KYROS]
So let us band together anew.

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:57.982
And rebuild our
beautiful Dressrosa!

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:05.964
Please look after
our home, little fairies.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:13.212
[DWARVES cheering]

00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:23.465
[MARINE A] Admiral Issho!
The video broadcast

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:25.905
to the surrounding islands
was a success!

00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:28.343
All right, thanks for your help.

00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:32.585
Tank! The Navy
must maintain face.

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.856
The pirates and
gladiators should hide.

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:36.860
Take them to the palace.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.064
Same goes for anyone
without a home.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:40.635
Can you do that?

00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:43.372
It'd be my pleasure, King Riku.

00:12:02.512 --> 00:12:05.951
[AKAINU] So. You're telling me
that that whole mix-up

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:08.590
with Doflamingo
leaving the Warlords

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:12.230
was actually from some power
even higher than the lot of you?

00:12:19.277 --> 00:12:21.883
Wanna explain how
that rat, Doflamingo,

00:12:21.983 --> 00:12:25.156
was able to manipulate
the world to his will?!

00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:27.995
This kinda malarkey needs
to end or else I'll be

00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:30.867
the laughingstock of
the entire Navy.

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:33.439
Don't pull a stunt
like that ever again.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.846
It would be wise
to hold your tongue, Admiral.

00:12:36.946 --> 00:12:40.555
Your honor is of no concern
to us right now.

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:42.023
Don't get a big head!

00:12:42.123 --> 00:12:44.294
The Navy merely acts
as our public face.

00:12:44.394 --> 00:12:45.964
[ELDER STAR B]
Regardless, this whole affair

00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:48.435
was placed in
Cipher Pol's hands.

00:12:48.536 --> 00:12:51.375
Huh? Cipher Pol, you say?

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:53.914
Let's lay out the facts here.

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:55.985
Sounds like the
Celestial Dragon's puppet

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:57.321
went right over your heads.

00:12:57.421 --> 00:12:59.425
Are you all really
okay with that?

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:02.030
Watch your
insolent mouth, Sakazuki.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.968
Got anything to say
about Kuzan?

00:13:04.068 --> 00:13:05.236
[AKAINU]
Hm?

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:07.340
[ELDER STAR E] How is
someone as powerful as him

00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:10.479
allying himself with
Blackbeard of all people?

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:14.387
The Navy's reputation
is already sullied!

00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:17.728
That lackadaisical jackass
officially resigned!

00:13:17.828 --> 00:13:19.966
Who he chooses to partner with

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:22.404
has absolutely jack
to do with us!

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:24.576
[SICILY]
Five Elders! Fleet Admiral!

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:25.844
[AKAINU]
Huh?

00:13:29.284 --> 00:13:32.491
[pants] I have urgent news.

00:13:32.592 --> 00:13:35.096
It's concerning the state of
the Don Quixote Family!

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:37.033
Doflamingo has fallen!

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:39.939
Defeated by Straw Hat
and Law's alliance!

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:41.475
But in the process,

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:43.680
Dressrosa was reduced
to rubble, completely.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.017
[AKAINU]
Huh? That's absurd!

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:50.928
I see.

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:52.931
It was that damned boy?

00:13:56.438 --> 00:14:01.382
[AKAINU growling]

00:14:01.482 --> 00:14:03.787
[SICILY]
Sir, it doesn't end there!

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:04.555
[AKAINU]
Huh?!

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.253
[NARRATOR]
The broadcast transmission

00:14:20.353 --> 00:14:21.990
that was sent from Dressrosa

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.196
quickly became the talk
of every country.

00:14:25.296 --> 00:14:27.869
There's breaking news,
everybody!

00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:29.371
[NARRATOR]
Spreading like wildfire,

00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:32.310
it caused chaos
amongst the underworld.

00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:34.314
[MAN B]
Joker was defeated!

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.485
[SOLDIER A]
Your Majesty!

00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:38.623
He was the only
weapon supplier we had!

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:42.798
We'll announce our
surrender at once.

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:44.167
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:51.148
The war is finally over!

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:56.124
[PIRATE CAPTAIN A] But we've
already paid! We had a deal!

00:14:56.224 --> 00:14:59.064
Joker, you slimy bastard!

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.401
The weapons are
somewhere in Dressrosa!

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:04.074
So is a Navy Admiral!
Forget about it, man!

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.445
So our sweet Devil Fruit
deal fell through?

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:09.585
What's gonna happen to
my SMILE agreement, huh?

00:15:09.685 --> 00:15:13.058
If only those meddling
punks hadn't shown up!

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:19.705
[SENGOKU]
Come on, Tsuru.

00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:22.143
You didn't need to
set sail, I have this.

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:23.880
[TSURU] Took the words
right outta my mouth,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.517
Inspector General.

00:15:25.617 --> 00:15:27.053
[SENGOKU] Well, I suppose you
have been on their trail

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:28.957
for quite some time now.

00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:31.228
[TSURU]
Yes, by your orders!

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:32.698
[SENGOKU]
Want a cracker?

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.000
[TSURU]
I'm good.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.141
[NARRATOR]
It was only a matter of time

00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.311
before the pirates of
the Worst Generation

00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:58.550
caught wind of the news
from Dressrosa.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:00.386
These eleven rookies,
who have bounties

00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:02.257
over one hundred million each,

00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:05.196
come from a variety
of powerful crews.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.635
They're infamous troublemakers
who made their rise

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:10.206
at the end of
the Great Pirate Era.

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:11.876
It's said they hold the key

00:16:11.976 --> 00:16:14.982
to the future of
this war-torn world.

00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:21.929
Might I suggest this?

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:24.467
Supreme is our
special of the day!

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:26.372
Huh? A thief!

00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:29.044
Get back here, you old bag!

00:16:29.144 --> 00:16:31.248
Now, where'd that old lady go?

00:16:35.657 --> 00:16:36.793
Damn, just a kid!

00:16:36.893 --> 00:16:38.429
Where are you? Hey!

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:43.138
[BONNEY] Mmm. Dang, they took
out Doflamingo. Not bad!

00:16:43.238 --> 00:16:45.476
I'm proud to call 'em
generation mates!

00:16:58.603 --> 00:17:03.713
[MONK PIRATE A] High Priest
Urouge! High Priest Urouge!

00:17:05.016 --> 00:17:08.823
[gasping] There's somebody
up here! High Priest!

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:14.234
Now that's just silly.
Do you know where we are?

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:17.140
A remote cloud island,
where no one can bother us.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.444
Trust me when I say it's a bird.

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:35.476
[CAPONE] Whoa, whoa,
the cojones on them two guys.

00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:37.280
Looks like our
lil' pirate "pallys"

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.317
are making a name
for themselves.

00:17:39.417 --> 00:17:40.854
That means we'll be
glomming Caesar

00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:42.490
for ourselves, boys. Capiche?

00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:44.828
[FIRETANK PIRATES]
Yeah. Father!

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.374
[KID] That didn't take 'em long
to pull ahead of us.

00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:53.445
This is a huge triumph.

00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:56.652
Interesting, since Doflamingo's
got connections with Kaido.

00:17:56.752 --> 00:17:59.925
There's no way he's not
gonna be pissed off.

00:18:00.025 --> 00:18:03.666
If this was intentional, they
just outted who they're after.

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:07.541
One of The Four Emperors.

00:18:09.879 --> 00:18:12.249
Facing the King of
the Beasts himself, huh?

00:18:14.187 --> 00:18:16.993
[KILLER] Well, at least our
target is different than theirs.

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:20.668
It saves us the hassle of
wasting manpower on them.

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:24.140
That still leaves
Red-Haired Shanks all to us.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.146
We'll be able keep
focusing on that goal.

00:18:27.246 --> 00:18:28.783
[NARRATOR]
Word even traveled to Drake,

00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:31.923
who once made name for
himself by provoking Kaido.

00:18:32.457 --> 00:18:34.261
[PIRATE A]
Doflamingo killed your old man?

00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:35.864
How'd I not know?

00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:45.817
That's in the past now.
I bear no grudge.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:48.690
[PIRATE A]
Damn, dude, you are ice-cold!

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.161
[PIRATE B]
Why not come help us?

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:53.332
This needs to be reported
to the big man,

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.571
and something tells me,
he won't be happy.

00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:58.577
[PIRATE C] Master Kaido!
You're not gonna like this!

00:18:58.677 --> 00:19:01.315
[PIRATE A] That schmuck,
Joker, screwed up a good thing!

00:19:01.415 --> 00:19:03.753
We won't be getting
SMILEs anymore!

00:19:06.058 --> 00:19:08.830
[AKAINU] Stop playing
dumb with me, Issho!

00:19:10.935 --> 00:19:12.871
[AKAINU] Now, you damn well
know what it means

00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:16.111
for a ranking official to admit
an oversight on this scale!

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:19.585
Why didn't you think to
first report this to HQ?

00:19:21.354 --> 00:19:23.025
If I'd followed protocol,

00:19:23.125 --> 00:19:25.396
I have a feeling that
the news would've come out

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:27.568
with a bit of a
different spin on it.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:30.472
[AKAINU]
Huh? Care to repeat that?

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:37.788
[SMOKER] I believe
the Seven Warlord System

00:19:37.888 --> 00:19:39.858
should be abolished.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.637
Two years ago,

00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:49.444
I was there in person when
Crocodile's ruse was exposed.

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:53.553
And the Navy couldn't do
a damn thing about it.

00:19:57.861 --> 00:20:00.399
If it weren't for
the Straw Hats back then,

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:03.172
Alabasta would have
become a pirate nation,

00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:06.211
just like Dressrosa is now.

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:07.848
But the Government
falsely declared

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:11.221
Crocodile's downfall
was due to the Navy!

00:20:12.456 --> 00:20:15.295
If only I had a higher
rank back then!

00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:30.159
I'll be damned.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:32.196
Fujitora really did it.

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.633
Well done.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.504
I remember how frustrated
both of us were

00:20:35.604 --> 00:20:37.941
after what happened
back in Alabasta.

00:20:38.977 --> 00:20:42.383
But this time, the Straw Hats'
achievement won't be covered up.

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:47.126
It kinda feels like retribution
for that whole mess.

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:48.897
I'll hand it to him.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:51.434
I couldn't pull this off when
I was in the same position.

00:20:51.535 --> 00:20:53.540
I'm completely astonished.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.309
Oh! We've got muffins!

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:56.445
Shall I make some coffee?

00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:58.850
I said astonished, not famished!

00:21:00.353 --> 00:21:02.156
[GIRL A]
Hey, Sis! We're hungry!

00:21:02.256 --> 00:21:03.325
[KIDS]
Starving!

00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:04.895
You can have his share, then!

00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:06.264
Anyone want coffee?

00:21:06.364 --> 00:21:08.469
You can't give coffee
to kids, silly!

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.205
[BOY A]
I want a muffin!

00:21:10.306 --> 00:21:11.341
[BOY B]
Where's Mr. "MegaFunk"?

00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:13.078
I think you mean "Vegapunk."

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:15.583
It'll take just a few more days
before we reach his lab,

00:21:15.683 --> 00:21:17.286
so hang tight, okay?

00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:21.896
Look at that. The Captain's
so good with kids.

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:23.834
Man, I wish I were five!

00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:25.503
[TASHIGI]
All right, enough guys.

00:21:25.603 --> 00:21:27.373
There's still plenty
of work to do.

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:28.977
[MARINES]
Yes, ma'am!

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.880
[MARINE C] I love it when
you scold me, Captain!

00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:50.587
[AKAINU] It's called damage
control and it's common!

00:21:50.687 --> 00:21:52.390
[FUJITORA] Our superiors
thought those pirates

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.695
would help maintain
balance in this world.

00:21:54.795 --> 00:21:56.231
The government
gave them authority

00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:58.603
and they made people
suffer in turn.

00:21:58.703 --> 00:22:00.940
Now, you expect me
to paint myself a hero.

00:22:01.041 --> 00:22:03.847
Lying about solving
a problem that we created?

00:22:03.947 --> 00:22:07.253
[AKAINU] This is about HQ's
credibility and dignity!

00:22:07.353 --> 00:22:10.693
Uh. Issho, sir! I'd be careful.

00:22:10.793 --> 00:22:13.533
[AKAINU sighs] Your egocentric
actions have caused

00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:16.204
our system of justice
to lose all face today!

00:22:16.304 --> 00:22:18.042
If your face is
all you care about,

00:22:18.142 --> 00:22:20.647
then you should try a little
harder to keep it clean.

00:22:20.747 --> 00:22:23.519
If admitting to a wrong-doing
means your trust is gone,

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:26.525
then I'd say you never had any
in the first place, sir!

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:27.727
[MARINES gasp]

00:22:27.828 --> 00:22:31.367
[panting]

00:22:36.278 --> 00:22:39.251
[AKAINU growling]

00:22:39.351 --> 00:22:40.419
[AKAINU]
You're going to clean this

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.358
entire disaster up, Fujitora.

00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:47.968
You will not set a foot in any
Naval Base in the entire world

00:22:48.068 --> 00:22:52.343
until you bring me Straw Hat
and Law's heads.

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:53.879
You understand?!

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.423
[FUJITORA] Fine by me.
That's just what I wanted.

00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:03.098
I want some meat.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.690
[NARRATOR] Sabo checks in
with the Straw Hats

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.159
before leaving town

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:18.997
but finds only a few members
are still awake.

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.600
Revealing that he's
Luffy's brother,

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.403
he reminisces about
his childhood

00:23:22.504 --> 00:23:24.407
and what made him
the man he is today.

00:23:24.508 --> 00:23:25.777
From a boy who
was presumed dead,

00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:28.082
to a hero of the
Revolutionary Army,

00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:29.652
his journey is one to remember.

00:23:29.752 --> 00:23:31.487
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:33.125
"The Birth of the Legend!

00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:35.897
The Adventures of the
Revolutionary Warrior Sabo!"

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.903
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
