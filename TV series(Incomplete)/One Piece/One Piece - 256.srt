1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,804
If you're prepared to
die, then that's fine.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,539
Just come along with me.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,075
We'll brave the storm.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,442
On my sea train!

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,748
Whoa-hoa!

6
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,283
Awesome!

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,385
Its name is "Rocketman."

8
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,788
Comes with no guarantees,
so board at your own risk.

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,557
Rocketman!

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,592
Sounds fast!

11
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,128
Go ahead.

12
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:30,130
I just finished servicing it.

13
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,767
Water and coal has been loaded
and the steam's building up now.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,304
Thanks for getting it
ready for us. We owe you one!

15
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,473
I wouldn't celebrate
yet, if I were you.

16
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,508
You might not
even survive the ride.

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,612
This was our failed prototype
before the Puffing Tom.

18
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,148
No matter how you tune it,
you can't control its speed.

19
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,117
In other words,
it's a runaway train.

20
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,319
That's fine!

21
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:58,726
It can go as fast as it wants!

22
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,362
Straw Hat!

23
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,264
Please, Straw Hat.

24
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,633
You guys gotta take us with you!

25
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,334
The people from Galley-La said

26
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,704
you were gonna take a
sea train to Enies Lobby!

27
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,340
Those government
bastards took Franky!

28
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,343
They took our bro away from us!

29
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,412
I'll give up my pride
if I can save him!

30
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,083
C'mon.

31
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,551
Hurry up!

32
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,786
Thank you so much.

33
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,123
Thank you!

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,125
Thank you, Straw Hat!

35
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,226
Now let's take off!

36
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,149
All right boys and girls.

37
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,751
Hold on tight,
so you don't fall off!

38
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,455
Now Departing Water
Seven for Enies Lobby!

39
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,591
Here comes Rocketman!

40
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,527
Yeah!

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,595
Full speed!

42
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,833
Let's go!

43
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,636
We'll get everything back!

44
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,710
What in the world is this place?

45
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,012
An underground canal!

46
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,088
Hey!

47
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,522
Luffy, you okay?

48
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:53,059
Water in my nose!

49
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,428
Duh!!!

50
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,230
What did you
expect would happen?!

51
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,633
Careful!

52
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:02,869
Whew!

53
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,339
Didn't see that one coming!

54
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:05,973
Aw, man!

55
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,774
This is getting exciting!

56
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,347
Hey, hey, hey!

57
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,181
Granny!

58
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,082
It feels a lot
like we're falling!

59
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,421
We're almost to the exit now.

60
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,690
Full speed ahead
until we fly outta here!

61
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,358
What?

62
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:24,925
No way!

63
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,459
You're kidding, right?!

64
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,315
All right!

65
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,183
There it is!

66
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,484
Time to move out, men!

67
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,787
Let's charge ahead, join
them, and get Franky back!

68
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,757
Yeah!!!

69
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,793
Sodom! Gomorrah! Jump!

70
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,366
Huh?!

71
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,268
Straw Hat!

72
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,106
The entire Franky Family
thanks you for helping us!

73
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,609
We'll never forget it!

74
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,311
Fire the connection cannons!

75
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,058
Cool!

76
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,359
Hey, nice job!

77
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,728
Pretty high-grade
bulls you've got there!

78
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,229
Awesome!

79
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,667
Dammit!

80
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,702
Those stupid bastards!

81
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,336
You idiots!

82
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,804
You gotta be more careful!

83
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,505
Thanks for the help!

84
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,612
What a cheerful bunch of guys.

85
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,080
Hey, monster granny!

86
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,050
So is this that fastest
that Rocketman can go?

87
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,451
It's not very fast at all!

88
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,752
Just hold your horses.

89
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,655
Things'll change once
we hit the railway.

90
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,491
Railway?

91
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,426
Where is it?

92
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,494
I don't see it anywhere.

93
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,364
Looks like it
drifted a bit, huh?

94
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:14,268
Listen I know these sea trains
like the back of my hand.

95
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,537
I'll find that railway,
no problem!

96
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,619
Found ya!

97
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,653
Let's go!

98
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:36,724
Attention!

99
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,659
This train will soon
be on the railway.

100
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:42,463
Once we are, our acceleration
will increase exponentially!

101
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,797
Find something to hold on to

102
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,800
so we can keep the
injuries to a minimum.

103
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,467
"A minimum"?

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,502
We'll be injured regardless?

105
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,412
Damn!

106
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,179
I missed it!

107
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,080
No worries!

108
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,648
We're just getting started!

109
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,557
Listen, you!

110
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,159
Behave yourself!

111
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:12,726
Whoa!

112
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,328
That was close, Granny!

113
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,663
A little to the right!

114
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,598
Meow!

115
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,165
Don't you worry!

116
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,667
I'll get it next time!

117
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,036
You'll see!

118
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:22,803
Chimney!

119
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,237
Gonbe!

120
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:25,739
No!

121
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,774
I left you with Iceberg!

122
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,680
Meow! Meow!

123
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,715
How could this have happened?!

124
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,084
Get down from there
and come inside!

125
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,486
You'll be blown away out there!

126
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,256
We're fine! We're fine!

127
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,391
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!

128
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,227
Chimney!

129
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,630
I'm gonna fall!

130
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,632
Whatever you do, don't let go!

131
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,134
I'm flying!

132
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,069
Meow!

133
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,636
Wait!

134
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,404
Hold on a second, okay?

135
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,639
Let me slow down!

136
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,413
Oh, no!

137
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,348
I forgot!

138
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,616
No brakes!

139
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,383
We can't stop!

140
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,622
Whoa, what the heck?

141
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,357
Hey, that kind
of looks like fun!

142
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,792
Look, it's the Straw Hat guy!

143
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,194
Hi!

144
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,228
Meow!

145
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,095
Hurry!

146
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,465
Grab those two
and bring them inside!

147
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,435
Once this train hits the
railway, they'll be blown away!

148
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,569
Right!

149
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,204
Yes!

150
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:04,838
All right!

151
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,473
They got onto the railway!

152
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,308
What?!

153
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,309
No way!

154
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,010
Here! Let me take a look!

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,048
Yes, you're right!

156
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,116
I see I see!

157
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,218
Just what you'd expect
from Ms. Kokoro!

158
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,254
She's something else, isn't she?

159
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,754
Indeed!

160
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,988
I must admit.

161
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,725
For a while there, I wasn't
sure what was going to happen!

162
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,726
I know what you mean!

163
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,428
With this storm and those waves,

164
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,264
it must have been nearly
impossible to find the railway!

165
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,165
Exactly!

166
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,199
Quite right!

167
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,468
I can't imagine what
it must've been like to--

168
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,171
For sure! For sure!
Just look at--

169
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,639
Don't mind if I do!

170
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,541
Yes, I see!

171
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,243
She's something else, all right!

172
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,214
Yes, no doubt!

173
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,482
Hey, listen.

174
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,186
Don't you think we should let
Iceberg know what's going on?

175
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,420
Absolutely!

176
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:58,192
I bet the old guy's worried
himself sick about all of this!

177
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:58,892
Right!

178
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,595
One of us should tell him then!

179
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,541
Rock!

180
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,109
Paper!

181
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,556
Hey, there's no need to trouble
yourself over him, either.

182
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,059
If he can survive being
hit by a sea train,

183
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,793
then I'm sure he'll be okay.

184
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,168
So did you hear the news?

185
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,070
They're talking
about it all over.

186
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:20,073
"Tom's violent apprentice,
Cutty Flam, is dead."

187
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:25,746
He was hit by the sea train.

188
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,615
Iceberg, listen.

189
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,483
I know you can do it.

190
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,619
You're the first
apprentice of Tom,

191
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,822
the greatest shipwright
the world has ever known.

192
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:39,126
If anybody can do it, you can.

193
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,027
Hey, Kokoro.

194
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,663
One of these days
let's share a drink.

195
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:46,299
You know, when we actually
have something to drink to.

196
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,536
Yeah.

197
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,540
Tom, I won't let you down.

198
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,243
I'll watch over your dreams.

199
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,180
I'll protect everything.

200
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,451
Not only this town but
these blueprints, as well!

201
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:08,389
There's a visitor, sir.

202
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:11,425
He said he's a friend
from years back.

203
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,127
Do you know anyone
named "Cutty Flam"?

204
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:18,399
Franky?

205
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,367
Shall I show him in, sir?

206
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,403
No.

207
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,004
Turn him away.

208
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,614
You sure picked a
roundabout way of meeting me.

209
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,050
Mwell, maybe, but anyway,

210
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,751
what's up with that strange
looking body of yours?

211
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,952
Screw you!

212
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,622
The sea train mangled my body,
so in order to stay alive

213
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,091
I rebuilt it using
some iron scraps.

214
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,158
But that's not the issue!

215
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,827
I've heard that your
company has been contracted

216
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,096
to build ships for
the World Government!

217
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,165
I won't tolerate you doing
anything to help them!

218
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,132
How could you?

219
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,167
They took Tom away!

220
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:59,273
And the weapons that
caused the whole incident.

221
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,042
Have you forgotten
who made those?!

222
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,411
I'm sure you have plenty of
things you want to say to me,

223
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,213
but I have a few as well.

224
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,681
I still haven't forgiven you.

225
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,317
Four years isn't nearly
enough time for that.

226
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,752
I'm surprised you
even have the nerve

227
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:15,122
to show your face around
here after what happened!

228
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,090
What'd you say?!

229
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,057
The government told me

230
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,293
that you died in an
accident on the railway.

231
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,795
You never came back so
I believed it to be true.

232
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,231
Even if Tom forgave you,
remember this:

233
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:28,068
It doesn't mean for a
second that I'm going to.

234
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,641
What's with all the secrecy?

235
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,375
Something going on?

236
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,679
Hey, what're these?

237
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,482
The blueprints for
that old battleship?

238
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,117
Don't call yourself
Cutty Flam anymore.

239
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:45,553
It's only a matter of time

240
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:48,489
before the
government targets me.

241
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,324
Now listen carefully.

242
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,594
I want you to take these
and leave this island, Franky.

243
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:54,595
Why should I?

244
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,831
The "Cutty Flam" from
Tom's Workers is dead.

245
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,667
As long as you don't
use that name anymore,

246
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,469
then there'll be no
connection between us.

247
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,305
Additionally, if you
leave the island,

248
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,607
the whereabouts of the
blueprints will vanish.

249
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,075
Hey, hold on a second!

250
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,811
What happens if the
government comes after you

251
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,511
and you don't have them?!

252
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,213
I've said what I came to say.

253
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,181
What the--?

254
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,416
Hey, Iceberg!

255
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,117
We shouldn't see
each other again.

256
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,253
Wait! Hold on!

257
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,320
Listen to me.

258
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:22,556
Do you want to end up
the same way that Tom did?

259
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,291
Hang on to the blueprints.

260
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,226
If you're threatened
and your life is in danger,

261
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,361
just hand them over!

262
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,295
And if you don't wanna do that,

263
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:32,099
you can burn them
right before their eyes!

264
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,102
If you were me,
would you do that?

265
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,105
Tom had achieved so
many wonderful things.

266
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,106
But he gave up everything

267
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,076
to keep these blueprints
hidden from the world.

268
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,812
As long as the risk remains
that a woman named Nico Robin

269
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,648
can figure out how to restore
the weapon then the world

270
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,352
needs these blueprints
to be able to fight back!

271
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,188
If I continue to keep them
with me even if they

272
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,257
threaten my life, I won't hand
them over to the government!

273
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,025
Are you sure?

274
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,762
You know me--what if
I decide to build it?

275
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,265
Do you really think
that you can trust me?

276
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,833
I'm giving them to you.

277
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,269
Doesn't that answer
your question?

278
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,237
We never change, do we?

279
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,672
Every time we meet
face to face,

280
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,074
we yell and argue
with each other.

281
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:19,346
I won't forgive you, and you may
feel the same way about me, too.

282
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:25,753
Franky, I'm, I'm really--

283
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:29,456
I'm so glad that
you're still alive.

284
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:38,799
You listen to me!

285
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,534
I'm not gonna leave this island!

286
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,536
You got that, Ice-for-brains?!

287
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,505
I'm gonna do whatever
the hell I wanna do!

288
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,206
You think I'm gonna
do what you tell me?

289
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,207
I'd rather die!

290
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,310
Understand?!

291
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,447
Dammit, Flunky!

292
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,749
Why can't you get it through
that thick head of yours?!

293
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,185
This is to protect
the blueprints!

294
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:58,852
Shut it!

295
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,187
It's you who doesn't get it!

296
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,488
I'm not gonna leave this island!

297
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,356
No matter what!

298
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,293
Why the hell am I
thinking about

299
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,528
Ice-for-brains at a
time like this?!

300
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,098
Where is he?

301
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,100
Where the hell is Iceberg?

302
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,001
He's dead.

303
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,755
I thought I was a goner!

304
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,190
You almost were!

305
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,225
I said "If you
don't come inside,

306
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,594
you're gonna get blown away!"

307
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,496
Whew!

308
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,331
That speed was crazy!

309
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,366
Told ya!

310
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,301
He's right!! That was rough!!

311
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,070
Hurt my back.

312
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,271
Hold on a second.

313
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,074
There're a few more people
in here than there should be.

314
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:54,508
Yeah?

315
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,476
Who do you mean?

316
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,610
He means you!

317
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,211
I mean you, too!

318
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,253
I decided to
come along with you.

319
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,623
I tried but no matter
what I said or did,

320
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,492
I couldn't stop you.

321
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,360
And the enemy that
you'd go through all of this

322
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,363
to rescue your friend from
is the exact same one

323
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,766
that tried to kill Iceberg.

324
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,270
I've got a word or two of my own
I wanna say to those bastards!

325
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:23,904
Yeah!!

326
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,073
You're not the only one!!

327
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,076
We figured that if we snuck
onto the train and followed you,

328
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:30,477
we'd be right behind
you when things

329
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,613
went down with those
no good assassins!!

330
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:33,747
So here we are.

331
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,549
Seems our hunch was right.

332
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,517
Let us join you.

333
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,786
We wanna avenge Iceberg.

334
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,155
Sounds like we all
have a common enemy!

335
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,724
They're the same ones that
kidnapped our bro Franky!

336
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:44,925
Yeah, he's right!

337
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,695
No point in playing dumb,
we know exactly who they are!

338
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:48,929
Hey, Galley-La!

339
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:51,799
If anything happens to him,
it's gonna be on your shoulders!

340
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:52,800
Can it!

341
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,602
Iceberg's the one that's
endured the most here!

342
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:55,503
Hey!!

343
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:58,272
What the heck are
they talking about?!

344
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,273
Come on!!

345
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,741
There's something you're
not telling us, Paulie!!

346
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,509
Yeah. It's time to come clean.

347
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,711
Tell us everything.

348
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,346
We need answers.

349
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:07,114
You know who
the true culprit is.

350
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,749
We're not stupid, you know.

351
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,151
We've got a pretty
good idea who it is.

352
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,787
You're not gonna surprise us.

353
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,490
Well, I guess the story

354
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,293
about them disappearing
was too convenient.

355
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,562
Fine I'll tell you.

356
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:25,232
The true identities
of those masked men

357
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:30,104
are Lucci, Kaku, Kalifa,
and Blueno from the bar.

358
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:34,608
It was them. They're the ones
who tried to kill Iceberg.

359
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,379
Are you trying to tell me you
never even thought of them?!

360
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,681
You said they went
back to their hometowns!

361
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,216
Come on! You believed that?!

362
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,484
We... We thought it was Michael

363
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,185
and Hoychael from
the backstreet district!

364
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,053
Right!! Right!!

365
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,121
Who the hell are they?!

366
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:47,555
What?

367
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:48,222
You're kidding!

368
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,189
You've never heard of them?

369
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,358
They're pretty famous
in the backstreets!

370
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,559
Right!! Right!!

371
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,828
Why would half the foremen
leave in the middle of a crisis!

372
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,528
Didn't--

373
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,064
Whew! That really hit the spot!

374
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,532
Man, I was starving!

375
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:01,969
Right.

376
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,605
So even though we
got in a few fights

377
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,607
back in town with
both the Franky Family.

378
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,143
And with the
Galley-La shipwrights,

379
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,413
the enemy we're all going
after here is one and the same.

380
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,681
Now the strongest one,

381
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,282
the toughest out of all of them,

382
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,251
is definitely that pigeon guy.

383
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,085
He's mine.

384
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:20,054
I'm gonna beat
the crap out of him.

385
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:21,121
Luffy's right.

386
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:23,257
This is a battle to get
back what those four goons

387
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,259
from the World
Government took from us.

388
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:27,494
So we either reach them in time

389
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,130
or all of this will
be for nothing.

390
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,465
Granny!

391
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,199
Look!

392
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,734
It's Aqua Laguna!

393
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,568
Meow!

394
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,336
Oh?

395
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,238
It's here already?

396
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,372
Hey, let me take a look!

397
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:45,079
Oh, no!

398
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,080
Hey!

399
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,248
Shouldn't you be in the
engine room right now?

400
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:50,250
You've gotta find some way
to dodge that gigantic wave!

401
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:54,622
Rocketman can't be
controlled, remember?

402
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,224
We can't adjust the
speed, use the brakes,

403
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,159
or change our course.

404
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,396
My job ended as soon as
I got us up on the railway.

405
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,733
The train's lined up on the
tracks, running at full speed,

406
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:08,736
and there's nothing
anybody can do to stop it.

407
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,737
No.

408
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,938
Hey!

409
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:14,174
If we don't do something,
and fast this train's gonna...

410
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:21,181
Everybody on this train
has the exact same goal.

411
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,384
There's no point in
fighting separately.

412
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,119
Yeah.

413
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,486
He's right.

414
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,191
From this point forward,
we fight as one!

415
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,527
There are two more of
my crew on that other train.

416
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,795
Once we've caught up to them,

417
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,265
our fighting force
will be even stronger.

418
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:41,668
Listen up!

419
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:43,737
We're not gonna let
that big wave beat us!

420
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,207
We will achieve our goal!

421
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,343
Let's go!!!

422
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,746
Yeah!

423
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,695
Hey, look!

424
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,597
That wave is freakin' huge!

425
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,365
Amazing!

426
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,068
If we don't do something,
it's gonna swamp Rocketman!

427
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:22,436
Everybody hang on to something!

428
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,203
Are we gonna die?

429
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:23,737
All right, Captain.

430
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,738
Let's do this!

431
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,372
Yeah!

432
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,039
"Do this"?

433
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,441
What are you guys gonna do?

434
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,476
We're gonna fire a cannon!

435
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,680
On the next One Piece:
"Smash the Wave!

436
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:35,482
Luffy and Zoro Use
the Strongest Combo!"

437
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
