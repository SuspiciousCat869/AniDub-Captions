1
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,723
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,460
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,028
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,031
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,565
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,368
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,037
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,973
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,842
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,478
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,012
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:02,515
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,752
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:09,156
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,325
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,997
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,103
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,405
Luffy has finally
arrived at Marineford

19
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,440
to rescue his brother, Ace.

20
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,542
Inside the bay, the
Whitebeard Pirates

21
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,611
are fighting their
way toward the scaffold,

22
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,579
but the Navy
stands in their way.

23
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,516
Meanwhile at the bay head,
the Pacifistas launch

24
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,784
a merciless attack
on the allied pirates,

25
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,987
hell-bent on slaughtering
every last one of them.

26
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:44,291
[panting]

27
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:46,627
I'm serious,
this battle is a fake!

28
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,928
Just ask him!

29
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,797
I know about your
treacherous deal with the Navy!

30
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,499
You have their
assurance that Ace

31
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,002
and all of your pirates
won't even get scratched!

32
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,671
They'll just go
after your allies!

33
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,973
Forty-three captains
fight beside you

34
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,976
and you handed us
all to the Navy,

35
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,412
just to protect Roger's son!

36
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,012
[gasps]

37
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,250
I don't know if you
realize the magnitude

38
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:13,520
of what you've
just done, Squard.

39
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:17,424
You thrust a sword
into your father's body,

40
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,059
trying to kill him.

41
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,029
You've lost your way,
my poor, stupid son!

42
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,605
[SQUARD gasping]

43
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,710
But I still love you.
Even if you are a damn fool.

44
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,714
[WHITEBEARD] So, Squard,
please treat him kindly.

45
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,884
I don't love Ace more
than any other son of mine.

46
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,852
On that, you have my word.

47
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:50,458
Every single one of you
is part of my family!

48
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:54,028
He hasn't changed
one bit, the bastard!

49
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,330
But that crafty
old snake gave us a pretty

50
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,133
good shakeup, didn't he?

51
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:04,004
But to even suggest that I'd
sell out my sons is ridiculous!

52
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,847
They can leave now.

53
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:18,252
He destroyed the ice wall.
He's a sharp one.

54
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,053
If you're a true pirate,

55
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,324
then you choose which
path to take on your own!

56
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,227
Those of you who'll
still follow me,

57
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,528
put your lives on the line!

58
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,733
Get ready, men!
He's coming this way!

59
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,970
The strongest pirate
in the world!

"The Encircling Walls Activated!

Oh, man, here it comes.

Heh.

00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,474
We're with you
all the way, Pops!

67
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,675
Clear a path! Let's do this!

68
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,814
Don't let them get any closer!

69
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,183

72
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,129
He's too strong.

73
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,441
[MARINE C]
Activating the encircling wall!

74
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,210
Just get it done, already!

75
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,844
Right!

77
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,388
What's the matter?

78
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:38,959
Uh, it seems that the wall
is jammed beneath the ice!

79
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,462
[MARINE D grunts]
Then fix it somehow!

80
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,696

Yes, sir!

83

[SQUARD]
Why are you doing this?

84
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,075
Damn it, I-I don't
understand anything anymore!

85
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,945
I bought that story
hook, line, and sinker.

86
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,147
Even though he was from the
Navy, I trusted him over Pops.

87
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,185
I was jealous, I was scared,
but I knew he was right!

88
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:13,360
So, why? Why is Pops
still trying to save us?

89
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,162
Why didn't he just give us up

90
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,798
and let us die when
he had the chance?

91
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,933
That wasn't supposed to happen!

92
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,103
He swore to me Pops
would betray us!

93
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,941
Damn you, Squard! How the hell
could he let the Navy

94
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,943
trick him into stabbing Pops?

95
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,746
Does that fool really
think he would turn on us?

96
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,217
How could you do this?
Think of how Pops must feel!

97
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,620
[SQUARD]
If I was lied to...

98
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,424
[SQUARD]
...then what I've done...

99
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,660
What I've done to Pops...

Hey! Squard!

107
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:25,699
Pull it together. Tears won't
fix what you've done.

112
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:01,167
That old man's tough. He gets
stabbed and he's still at it.

113
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,670
I gotta get serious
and save Ace!

114
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,140
Off we go!

Hm?

117

They all abandoned their posts

120

and retreated to the plaza
while we weren't looking.

121
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,439
[JIMBEI] Hmm. Indeed,
that is a bit troubling.

122
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,841
But old Whitebeard
has joined the fray now.

123
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,310
That ought to put
our worries to rest!

124
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:47,681
True! We can handle whatever
dirty tricks they throw at us!

125

Why aren't the walls up?

thicker than we thought!

of our plan. This is bad.

[LUFFY]
Jimbei!

179
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,814
Hang on, I'll pull you up!

180
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:49,022
[panting]

181
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,257
Thanks, Jimbei.

182
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,926
I owe ya, again.

183
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,627
Thank me when this is over.

184
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:58,132
Is that crazy old man trying
to get his own crew killed?

185
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:02,035
No. His crew was ready. They're
used to this kind of thing.

186
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,410
[MARINES groaning, murmuring]

187
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,879
[MARINE J]
I need help!

188
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,847
Hey! Are you all right?

189
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,284
[HELMEPPO] I feel like
I survived the end of the world.

190
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:20,020
[gasping]

191
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,225
[HELMEPPO gasps]

192
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,226
What the...?

193
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,366
[COBY]
One man did this?

194
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,135
He really is the
strongest pirate alive.

195
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:40,707
[panting]

196
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,777
I've never seen such
fearsome power before,

197
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:49,049
but in the name of the absolute
justice I've sworn to uphold,

198
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:53,120
I'd rather die than let you
pass through here!

199
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,089
[yells]

200
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,426
[JOHN GIANT grunts]

201
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:03,063
[WHITEBEARD grunts]

202
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,569
[groans]

203
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,141
It's headed right for us!

204
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,575
[MARINES yelping]

205
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,680
The shockwave's gonna
hit the scaffold!

206
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,082
Yeah! Tear it apart!

207
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:37,998
[MARINE EE] What happened?
That looked like a direct hit!

208
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,799
But did we get it?

209
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,140
Doesn't look like it
even touched the scaffold.

210
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,577
So, did something
block the blast?

211
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,045
[gasps] Do you see that?

212
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,817
[PIRATE H]
It's the three admirals!

213
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,653
[MARINES gasping]

214
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,923
This mess wouldn't have happened
if the walls were ready.

215
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:06,026
Whose fault is that?
Your ice is blocking them!

216
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,730
Sure, but you could have
just melted the ice.

217
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:11,398
Couldn't you?

218
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:17,972
Holy crap.

219
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,675
I knew they were strong,
but to repel that shock wave?

220
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,911
[JOZU]
Don't give up, men. Not now.

221
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:26,213
[PIRATES]
Commander Jozu!

222
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,815
I say we charge
the bastards while

223
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,751
they're still reeling from
the blast. Are ya with me?

224
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,386
Pops knocked open
a window for us,

225
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,888
so we better not squander it!

226
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,825
Let's go! Give 'em hell,
Whitebeard Pirates!

227
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:42,763
[PIRATES shouting]

228
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,665
Take 'em down!

229
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,206
Sounds like they're pretty
pissed off down there.

230
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,175
Scary.

231
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,478
I want an update on the walls.

232
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,346
Uh, they're still down.

233
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:02,449
Then divert the energy
that's flowing into the city.

234
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,952
Pump every ounce of
power into the walls!

235
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:06,920
Sir! Right away!

236
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,624
[LUFFY yelling]

237
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,393
Almost there, Ace!

238
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,064
[LUFFY grunting]

239
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:21,902
Luffy!

240
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,239
I'm comin' for ya!

241
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,042
I'll save you!

242
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,443
Activating full power!

243
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,987
[LUFFY grunts]

244
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,991
What is that?

245
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,001
What? The walls!

246
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,009
[PIRATES gasping]

247
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,014
[PIRATE BB]
They've closed us in!

248
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,149
[PIRATE CC]
What the hell's going on?

249
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,254
Take that!

250
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,324
[PIRATE N grunts]

251
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,195
Well, did it break?

252
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,429
What?!

253
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,233
Oh, man! Not a scratch!

254
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,269
That's gotta be some
seriously thick steel!

255
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,739
[PIRATE DD] I don't know about
you guys, but I'm pretty sure

256
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,874
these are the walls
they were talking about.

257
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,310
[PIRATE EE] C'mon!
Are you too scared to fight us?

258
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,149
Ahh! Hey! Look up there!

259
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:45,586
They've got an arsenal
of cannons locked on us!

260
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,087
We gotta run!

261
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,624
They've got us locked in! There
isn't any place for us to--

262
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,360
[PIRATE P gasps]

263
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,362
[PIRATE P]
Except there!

264
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:56,830
[SENGOKU]
What's going on down there?

265
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,032
Why didn't the last wall raise?

266
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,735
Well, it's, uh, it's Oars' body.

267
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,938
The walls don't seem strong
enough to lift it, sir.

268
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:08,008
Also, it looks like his blood
is running into the system

269
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,076
and making it malfunction!

270
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,180
Damned beast!

271
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,387
[ACE]
Oars! You saved them.

272
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,560
Now, that's a noble death.

273
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,898
[MARCO] He may be dead,
but he's still fighting.

274
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,732
Impressive, huh?

275
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,603
[SQUARD grunts]

276
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,578
[WHITEBEARD]
You've given us a chance, Oars.

277
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,614
We must be swift.

278
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,049
You know what to do, Akainu!

279
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,240
Meteor Volcano!

280
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,309
[AKAINU yells]

281
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:31,158
[gasps] Holy crap.

282
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,926
That's lava.

283
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:39,467
Uh, I'm not feeling
good about this.

284
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,903
They vanished. Now what?

285
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:58,652
[rumbling]

286
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,288
[gasps] Do you guys hear that?

287
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:07,361
[rumbling continues]

288
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,697
[PIRATE Q yells]

289
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:22,943
[gasps] That's it.
We're finished.

290
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:27,381
They've got nowhere to run.

291
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:31,218
Now we'll melt that ice,
and drown them all!

292
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:37,624
[PIRATES yelling]

293
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,404
[IVANKOV, PIRATES yells]

294
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:05,986
[LUFFY gasping]

295
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,130
[NARRATOR] The Whitebeard
Pirates are trapped in the bay,

296
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:19,099
held there by Akainu's magma.

297
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:22,636
With Navy fire on all sides,
they climb over Oars Jr.'s body

298
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,204
in hopes of pushing forward.

299
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,073
In the midst of this chaos,
the order for Ace's execution

300
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:30,010
is given and Luffy
makes a drastic decision.

301
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:31,645
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

302
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,816
"Execution Order Issued! Break
Through the Encircling Walls!"

303
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,418
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
