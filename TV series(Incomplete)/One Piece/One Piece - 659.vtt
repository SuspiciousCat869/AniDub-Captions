WEBVTT

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:59.024
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:03.834
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.470
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.911
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.945 --> 00:03:13.252
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:16.660
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:18.564
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:20.801
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.835 --> 00:03:23.339
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.372 --> 00:03:26.045
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.383
Upon arrival, Luffy entered
a fighting tournament

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.255
that promises the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion.

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:34.028
While the final match of
the first round rages on,

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.132
the losers face a grim fate.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.771
But you're him, aren't you?

00:03:38.804 --> 00:03:42.010
Tell me, please.
Sir, you must be!

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:46.620
[TANK] To think you've been
alive all this time, King Riku.

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:49.993
[DOLDO] We're far enough from
prying eyes, I suppose.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:52.899
I might as well
shed my disguise.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:04:00.046
[LUFFY] "A Horrible Past!
The Secret of Dressrosa!"

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.298
[gasps] Wait! Mister Luffy!

00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:10.835
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:13.240
Oh hey, it's that guy!

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.345
I mean, what?
Who's Luffy? I'm Lucy!

00:04:16.378 --> 00:04:19.251
Whatever! That doesn't matter!

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:20.721
C'mon. Tell him!

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:23.393
You can't lose your nerve now!

00:04:23.427 --> 00:04:26.700
[LUFFY groans] If you don't have
anything to say, I'm leaving.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.671
I wanna go cheer for Rebecca.

00:04:28.704 --> 00:04:32.044
Huh? [gasps] Hold on a sec!

00:04:32.078 --> 00:04:35.016
I'm here because
Mister Zoro asked for a favor.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.887
Huh? Zoro?

00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:40.160
Uh-huh! He said I needed
to bring you to see him.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:43.734
Okay! Well. Where is he?

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:45.905
[BARTOLOMEO]
He's outside the coliseum.

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:47.007
I'll show you the way.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.144
If you'll just
follow me, please.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:52.117
Yeah, sure! Thanks,
Rooster Head!

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:56.125
[BARTOLOMEO]
He thanked me!

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:57.294
He trusts me!

00:04:57.327 --> 00:04:58.797
He needs me!

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.666
Not only that...

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.703
[LUFFY]
"Thanks, Rooster Head."

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:03.440
[BARTOLOMEO]
He gave me a nickname!

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:04.776
This is getting serious!

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.245
[LUFFY]
"Thanks, Rooster Head."

00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:08.784
[BARTOLOMEO] It's almost
like we're friends!

00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.859
Hey, you okay?

00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:25.383
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:27.755
The battle in Block D rages on!

00:05:27.788 --> 00:05:30.293
There are plenty
of fighters left!

00:05:41.316 --> 00:05:43.588
[gasping]

00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:46.159
[COMPETITOR C screams]

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:48.229
[GYATS]
Rebecca's as tenacious as ever!

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:50.734
She doesn't know when to quit!

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:57.114
[growling]

00:05:57.147 --> 00:05:58.751
[GYATS]
I must admit watching her

00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:00.755
not-unbeautiful fighting style

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:03.794
makes me want to
not unsupport her!

00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.574
[TOY SOLDIER] The truth is,
I'm Rebecca's father!

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.709
Wait... But you...

00:06:44.742 --> 00:06:47.347
[MAN AA] Your grandpa tried
to burn us down, Rebecca!

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.884
And now he's burning in hell!

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.688
[MAN BB]
Time for you to join him!

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.828
[CROWD] Down with
Riku's bloodline! Forever!

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:57.569
She really is King
Riku's granddaughter.

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:59.304
If what you say was true...

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:02.010
Hold it, what were you
before you transformed?

00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:04.081
I mean, if you're her father,

00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.887
and her grandfather
is the king...

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.759
Everything began on that night.

00:07:09.793 --> 00:07:11.697
Answer my question!

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.399
Are you a prince
or something, huh?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:18.310
Well, when I think about it,
the signs came before that.

00:07:18.343 --> 00:07:20.648
It truly began when
a woman named Monet

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.418
came to work at the palace.

00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.621
[gasps]

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:25.289
Oh, her.

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:31.169
That's the bird lady. Isn't it?

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:33.908
In only a decade,
the whole kingdom

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.449
has been transformed.
Its people as well.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:46.332
Hey! What happened here?

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.236
[MAN B] Some pirates were
starting a ruckus.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:49.573
But the royal army ran 'em out,

00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:51.943
so they didn't cause
much damage in the end.

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.150
Oh! There they are now!

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:56.418
[horse neighs]

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:03.399
I have a message from King Riku.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:05.638
Really? A message for us?

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.076
[TANK] "I am deeply sorry
I was unable to defend

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:10.079
your house from
the pirate attack.

00:08:10.113 --> 00:08:14.221
Thus I have sent the King Riku
Army to perform repairs for you.

00:08:14.255 --> 00:08:15.758
[MAN B]
That's not really necessary!

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:17.494
[TANK]
Let's get to work, men.

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:18.429
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:08:18.462 --> 00:08:20.399
Right! We might as
well help 'em out!

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:22.873
Yeah! King Riku
helps those in need.

00:08:22.906 --> 00:08:25.410
Least we can do is
follow his lead, right?

00:08:26.445 --> 00:08:28.450
C'mon, guys!
Let's knock this out!

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:33.827
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:43.714
My gosh! We've gone two weeks
without an inch of rain.

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:45.216
Yeah. Still.

00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:47.655
The flowers never
wilt. Even now.

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:49.024
Why's that?

00:08:49.058 --> 00:08:50.962
It's thanks to the
fairies, of course!

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:52.364
[WOMAN B]
No matter how dry it gets,

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.201
they always protect the flowers!

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:56.438
[BOY A]
I want more! I'm hungry!

00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:59.411
If you have strength enough
to shout, you won't starve.

00:08:59.444 --> 00:09:00.414
[BOY A]
Huh?

00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:02.985
No matter how poor
we might feel at times,

00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:05.490
there's never war here, y'know.

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:09.297
And peace is the most important
thing of all, don't you think?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.475
[TOY SOLDIER] In 800 years
of the Riku Dynasty,

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:17.682
never once was Dressrosa
embroiled in war.

00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:19.786
Goodness. That is remarkable.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.663
Yes. Almost a miracle.
Even if we were poor,

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:27.467
we had each other,
we helped each other.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.739
And thus, we were
rich in spirit.

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:34.347
Or we were, until our peace
was destroyed... by him.

00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:40.260
[TOY SOLDIER] Suddenly,
he descended upon the palace,

00:09:40.293 --> 00:09:43.165
dancing in the darkness
like a nightmare.

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.319
Halt! Who's there?

00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.233
[DOFLAMINGO]
Don't call for help.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.237
Otherwise,
things might get ugly.

00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.341
What the hell do you want?

00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:10.053
[DOFLAMINGO] My name is
Don Quixote Doflamingo.

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:13.392
Perhaps that's enough,
maybe you've heard of me?

00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:16.466
Your face says yes.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.804
I have heard troubling
tales of a pirate

00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:21.375
named Don Quixote
wreaking havoc nearby.

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:23.947
[DOFLAMINGO] Well, you were
right to be troubled,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.352
though that's only
the half of it.

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:29.593
Did you know my ancestors,
the Don Quixote Family,

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:31.729
once ruled this kingdom?

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:36.973
Even if you've forgotten,
I have not.

00:10:37.007 --> 00:10:40.748
Thus I've returned to
take my place as your king!

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.821
Ha. I know about
the havoc you wreaked

00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:45.791
by stealing Heavenly Tributes

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:48.496
before they could reach
the Celestial Dragons.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.006
And how you became a Warlord
by blackmailing the Government.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:56.112
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
What can I say?

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:58.517
Poor saps don't know
what to do with me!

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.453
You can't threaten someone
who's not afraid of

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:02.992
the Celestial Dragons,
after all!

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:04.963
Anyway, since you
know what I'm about,

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:06.398
let's cut to the chase.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:10.541
As I said, I want
my kingdom back.

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.576
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:11:11.609 --> 00:11:12.912
[DOFLAMINGO]
And if you don't give it to me,

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:16.485
I'll paint the streets
red with blood.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:20.293
[chuckles] But I know
you loathe violence.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:23.968
So, since I'm such a stand-up
guy, I'll make you an offer.

00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:25.871
A trade.

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:29.979
I'll sell you this kingdom for,
say, ten billion berries?

00:11:30.012 --> 00:11:32.919
You'd sell me my own kingdom?

00:11:32.952 --> 00:11:34.454
[DOFLAMINGO]
As a courtesy.

00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:36.224
I could also take it by force,

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:38.429
if you don't want to
accept my offer.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.470
To avoid bloodshed,
I would happily pay.

00:11:42.505 --> 00:11:44.241
If I could, that is.

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:47.882
But... ten billion berries
is far more than I have.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.050
[DOFLAMINGO]
Is it?

00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:53.292
If you bleed it
from your citizens,

00:11:53.325 --> 00:11:55.329
I imagine you can
scrounge it up.

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:56.599
[DOLDO]
What?

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.973
[DOFLAMINGO] You have until
sunrise, so I'd get moving.

00:12:00.006 --> 00:12:01.576
You can't get outside help.

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:03.847
This is to test
your worth as a king.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.922
And you can't tell your people
about me or our deal.

00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:10.728
If you don't like your odds,
then fight me.

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:14.635
But I'll warn you, even if
you win, it won't be pretty.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:18.943
Your people will be
bathed in carnage.

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:22.818
Choose well,
your majesty. [chuckles]

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.034
The man is a criminal!

00:12:31.068 --> 00:12:33.072
A war would be
justified, my lord!

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:36.780
Enough! Fighting to kill
is not the answer!

00:12:36.813 --> 00:12:39.886
We must never lose sight of
what it means to be human!

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.858
But sir, we could never
collect that much money!

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:46.866
Few of our citizens are wealthy
and no one has nearly that much!

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.139
Besides, the Don Quixote Family
abandoned Dressrosa!

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:52.076
We don't owe them
a single berry!

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.782
The only thing they deserve
is a sharp sword to the gut!

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:58.557
Our kingdom has not
engaged in war in 800 years.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.761
That fact is proof
of our humanity.

00:13:00.795 --> 00:13:02.230
You are not a beast!

00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:03.567
We don't kill!

00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:05.303
I will not allow it!

00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:06.238
But, sir.

00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:08.743
[DOLDO]
Stand down, Captain Tank!

00:13:08.777 --> 00:13:12.250
I understand your frustration,
but above all else,

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:14.956
this kingdom must value
the lives of its citizens.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.295
In your heart, I know
you feel the same way.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.734
Please, Tank.

00:13:30.888 --> 00:13:32.558
We truly believe in you.

00:13:32.592 --> 00:13:34.729
We're the King Riku
Army, after all.

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:37.935
We bear the name of
our ruler with pride.

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:41.408
Sir, you can count
on our service.

00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:44.214
[DOLDO] Thank you for
those kind words, Tank.

00:13:44.248 --> 00:13:45.784
[TANK]
That's not necessary.

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:49.525
Rather, forgive me for
being so disrespectful.

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:51.863
Listen up! We have little time.

00:13:51.896 --> 00:13:54.334
Split up and head to
different villages.

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:57.207
Collect the ten billion
from all over the kingdom.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.516
If you can't, Dressrosa
will be ruled by pirates!

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.252
I fear this won't be pleasant.

00:14:03.286 --> 00:14:04.956
We'll lose the trust
of our citizens

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:06.926
when we demand their money.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.231
But bear it till morning.

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:10.634
When everything is settled,

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.373
I will do everything in my
power to make it up to them.

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:14.742
This is the only way.

00:14:14.775 --> 00:14:17.180
We can't use trickery
to get out of this.

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:18.984
Every last berry counts!

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:21.990
The fate of our nation is
resting on your shoulders!

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:23.626
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:27.333
All right! Let's go!

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.705
[SOLDIERS]
Yeah!

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:39.124
It's the Army.

00:14:39.157 --> 00:14:41.495
It's awfully late.
You think something's wrong?

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:44.802
And look! Is that Captain Tank?

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.238
[TANK]
Stop!

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:55.591
It's an emergency! Listen!

00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:57.828
I need you to find
every last berry in town

00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:59.599
and bring them here immediately.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:00.601
[MAN CC]
Huh?

00:15:00.634 --> 00:15:02.337
[OLD MAN C]
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.807
[WOMAN A]
I don't understand.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.476
Just bring the money! Right now!

00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:06.646
Hurry up!

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.049
[WOMAN D] What do you think
the King is gonna say

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:09.586
when he hears of this?

00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:14.829
We're here...
on orders from the king.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.266
[WOMAN D] What do you think
the King is gonna say

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.136
when he hears of this?

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:38.710
[TANK] We're here...
on orders from the king.

00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:41.281
Hurry! There's no time
left to explain!

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.854
Just do it!
Have faith in King Riku.

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:46.258
Don't ask questions
and bring the money!

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.764
Please! Listen to me!

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:51.301
This is too fishy.

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:52.571
[TANK]
It's hopeless!

00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:55.510
Who would agree to such
at outlandish request?

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:58.683
The video transponder snail?

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:00.219
People of Dressrosa.

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.389
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
It's King Riku!

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:02.825
He'll settle this mess!

00:16:02.858 --> 00:16:06.465
I know this is rather sudden,
and it must seem quite odd,

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:08.803
but please, hear my plea.

00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:10.941
I need to borrow
all of your money,

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:13.245
and I need to do so immediately.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.017
It is with great regret
that I cannot offer you

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.055
a reason for this request.

00:16:19.124 --> 00:16:20.694
The king is begging?

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.531
King Riku!

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.036
Why? This doesn't make sense!

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:27.406
It came outta nowhere, too.

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:31.849
[NOBLE A] My lord, no!
Raise your head! Stop it!

00:16:31.883 --> 00:16:34.087
You have to show some
dignity as our leader!

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.290
That's enough!

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:37.494
Stand up! This is mad!

00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:38.997
Think of the history books!

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.333
Every descendant of yours

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.738
will be ashamed of
this crass indignity!

00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:43.741
[NOBLE B]
King Riku!

00:16:43.774 --> 00:16:45.376
[NOBLE C]
This won't accomplish a thing!

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.146
[NOBLE A]
You're humiliating yourself!

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.984
You'll turn us into
a laughingstock!

00:16:49.018 --> 00:16:50.955
[NOBLES]
King Riku!

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:52.892
Do you think this is a joke?

00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.363
I would sacrifice
anything for this!

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:57.702
I don't care! Curse my pride!

00:16:57.735 --> 00:17:00.273
I'd chop off my arms and legs
if that's what it would take

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:01.542
to keep my kingdom safe!

00:17:01.575 --> 00:17:02.644
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:17:04.716 --> 00:17:08.724
[DOLDO] Listen, Tank.
If things go wrong tonight,

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:11.897
I'll bear the burden
and kill Doflamingo.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.635
Surely not. You can't.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.444
I trust you. Do your best.

00:17:22.117 --> 00:17:25.791
[TANK] He put his faith,
his life, in my hands.

00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:28.395
I must collect that
money at any cost!

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.105
[TANK] I must be willing to
sacrifice everything.

00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:36.846
Even the faith of the people,
if that's what it takes.

00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:45.730
[DOLDO]
I beg of you!

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:50.775
Come on! What is
everyone waiting for?

00:17:50.808 --> 00:17:52.343
Let's go get that money!

00:17:52.377 --> 00:17:54.748
Yeah, guys!
The king's a good man.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:57.487
If he needs our help that badly,
we don't need to question why!

00:17:57.521 --> 00:17:59.324
Yeah! He must have a reason!

00:17:59.358 --> 00:18:00.694
Don't worry about it now!

00:18:00.727 --> 00:18:02.664
[MAN DD]
Everyone bring out your money!

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:04.101
[MAN EE]
All right!

00:18:04.134 --> 00:18:07.774
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.656
King Riku.
Your virtue may save us.

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:34.528
Take it.

00:18:34.562 --> 00:18:35.764
Thank you!

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:39.705
[TANK]
I was a fool.

00:18:39.739 --> 00:18:41.008
The people of this nation

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:43.445
share the same kindness
the Riku family has shown them

00:18:43.479 --> 00:18:45.149
for eight centuries.

00:18:45.182 --> 00:18:47.454
This is a wonderful kingdom.

00:18:47.487 --> 00:18:49.725
Surely, it can be saved.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.428
Thank you!

00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:54.267
[MAN FF]
Long live King Riku!

00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:07.393
[DOLDO]
Thank you, everyone.

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:14.575
[TANK] We need to hurry
back to the palace!

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:15.977
Hope this is enough!

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.013
Full speed, men!

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.550
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:21.856
[gasps] Captain Tank!

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:22.825
What's wrong?

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:25.296
Seems the King went to Sevio.

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:26.799
It's on the screen right now.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.168
What's he doing?

00:19:34.347 --> 00:19:37.353
King Riku! You didn't
have to come all this way!

00:19:37.387 --> 00:19:38.857
We got it!

00:19:38.891 --> 00:19:41.061
[DOLDO]
Run away!

00:19:41.094 --> 00:19:42.764
[WOMAN B]
It's the king!

00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:45.469
King Riku!

00:19:45.503 --> 00:19:47.775
I don't know what's happening,
but we're all here to help out!

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:49.545
We trust you completely!

00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.916
[DOLDO]
Get away!

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.387
Run away!

00:19:56.792 --> 00:20:00.065
[gasps] King Riku! What's wrong?

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:04.508
Please, stop! There's
ammunition in that building!

00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:09.852
[ALL gasp]

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.795
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:20:24.882 --> 00:20:26.251
Sir, why?

00:20:29.692 --> 00:20:33.466
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.570
[TANK]
No, this can't be.

00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:43.451
Stop it! I'm begging you!

00:20:43.485 --> 00:20:45.524
[SOLDIER BB]
King Riku, please wait!

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:46.760
[SOLDIER CC]
What are you doing?

00:20:46.793 --> 00:20:49.230
Go! Stay away from me!

00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:51.401
Or I'm going to hurt you!

00:20:51.434 --> 00:20:52.538
[SOLDIERS groan]

00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:53.472
[WOMAN I screams]

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:55.209
Soldiers, too?

00:20:57.113 --> 00:21:00.854
[DOLDO] My body.
It's moving on its own!

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:07.199
[SOLDIER FF screams]

00:21:11.074 --> 00:21:15.684
My Lord. I don't understand.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:19.992
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:25.135
Oh, Riku! What a
naughty king you are!

00:21:25.168 --> 00:21:27.273
The night's still
young, soldiers!

00:21:27.306 --> 00:21:28.977
Don't just stand there gawking!

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.549
Why don't you join the dance?

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:40.466
[DOFLAMINGO]
Parasite String!

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:42.537
M-My arm! It's moving!

00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:44.908
What the hell is
happening to me?

00:21:48.315 --> 00:21:51.387
Now the soldiers are
cutting people down, too!

00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:55.597
[MAN KK]
Have mercy!

00:21:57.934 --> 00:21:58.970
[MAN NN]
No!

00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:02.911
C-Captain, help me!

00:22:02.944 --> 00:22:04.481
Somebody, stop me!

00:22:04.515 --> 00:22:06.919
I've lost control of my body!

00:22:08.455 --> 00:22:11.428
[TANK]
I know. It's the same with me.

00:22:11.461 --> 00:22:14.868
Why? What's causing this? [sobs]

00:22:14.902 --> 00:22:17.674
This must be what happened
to the king, too.

00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:19.978
[MAN QQ] Why are you
doing this, King Riku?

00:22:20.012 --> 00:22:22.684
[MAN U] He was such
a kind man before.

00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:27.293
Is there something
we've done to anger you?

00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:29.163
[DOLDO]
What could I possibly say?

00:22:29.197 --> 00:22:31.100
Nothing can justify this.

00:22:31.134 --> 00:22:34.307
We're done,
the kingdom is finished.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.648
We fell right into
Doflamingo's trap!

00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:39.284
[MAN SS]
The King's lost his mind!

00:22:39.317 --> 00:22:40.754
Everyone run for your lives!

00:22:40.787 --> 00:22:42.891
[MAN TT]
No more! Stop!

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:46.165
[TREBOL] Hey, hey!
Can we do it already, please?

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.235
Doffy!

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:52.678
[DOFLAMINGO] Now, now.
We can't rush things.

00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:54.882
I need them
trembling with fear,

00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:56.853
in the depths of despair.

00:22:56.886 --> 00:23:00.961
And when this kingdom hates
King Riku with all its heart,

00:23:00.994 --> 00:23:04.669
that's when the
heroes can appear.

00:23:04.702 --> 00:23:06.872
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.761
[NARRATOR] Doflamingo
manipulates the Riku army.

00:23:17.794 --> 00:23:20.767
Suddenly, a hero arrives
to save the day--

00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:23.138
none other than
Doflamingo himself!

00:23:23.172 --> 00:23:26.144
As the citizens' cheers
echo across the land,
