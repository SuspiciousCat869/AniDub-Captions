00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.013
[laughing]

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.222
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.672
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.955
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.988 --> 00:02:46.165
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.671
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:51.944
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:53.781
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.186
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.224
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.534
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.170
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:08.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.152
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.428
[NARRATOR] At long last,
the Straw Hat Pirates

00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:19.332
have reached the waters
of the New World,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:21.436
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.640
Forming an alliance
with the Warlord, Law,

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:26.045
the Straw Hats capture
the evil scientist, Caesar,

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.051
and head to Dressrosa for
the next phase of their plan.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:32.759
Their objective is to shut down
a man-made Devil Fruit factory.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.005
[LUFFY laughs]

00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:43.279
Dressrosa! Let's party!

00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:45.718
[NARRATOR] When Luffy and
the others arrive at Dressrosa,

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:49.993
a kingdom ruled by Doflamingo,
they divide into three teams.

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:54.034
The first team will head to
Green Bit to hand over Caesar.

00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:58.309
The second team will stay on
the Sunny to guard the ship.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:01.249
And a third team will
destroy the SMILE factory

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:03.453
and rescue a samurai.

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:07.094
[NARRATOR] Luffy and the others
reach the port town Acacia,

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:11.036
where living toys
walk the streets.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.705
Entering a bar to eat lunch,

00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:14.943
they witness an
interesting scene.

00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:17.080
[LUFFY]
You guys smell that?

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.224
[gasps, chuckles]

00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:34.683
What is it, friend?
Did I win or lose?

00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:35.851
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K chuckles]

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:42.799
Oh, too bad! Looks like black!
Your streak is over!

00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:44.603
White! Let's go!

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.840
Black for me!

00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:50.948
Oh! Black 20! You lose again!

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:53.821
[FUJITORA growls]
White again, please!

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:56.059
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
Another black! Wow!

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:57.494
White!

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.202
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
I'm sorry!

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.273
Another black.

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:05.845
Seems like all my luck ran out.

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:07.782
This is no good at all.

00:05:07.816 --> 00:05:12.057
Give up? You had
enough, old man?

00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:12.959
[FUJITORA]
Not yet.

00:05:12.992 --> 00:05:14.662
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K gasps]

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:19.740
[FUJITORA] One last time.
I'll bet everything I've got.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:21.309
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
That's the spirit!

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:23.881
You pick whatever color
catches your fancy,

00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:25.952
and I'll take the other, okay?

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.891
Of course, I'll bet
everything I've got as well!

00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:30.895
[FUJITORA]
You must be feeling lucky today.

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:35.203
Uh-huh. All right, here goes.

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.077
Place your bet.

00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:45.691
[FUJITORA]
This time, I'm certain.

00:05:45.725 --> 00:05:49.131
Everything on white,
if you would, sir.

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:05.063
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
If you're set on choosing white,

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.202
I got only one option.
Everything on black!

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:09.906
[FUJITORA]
Swell.

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:17.823
Come on, white! Win big!

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.159
Fat chance! Go black!

[gasping]

00:06:42.605 --> 00:06:45.243
[FUJITORA]
So, where did we land?

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:03.313
[FUJITORA] Your silence is
the only answer I need.

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:06.218
It landed on white, didn't it?

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:10.294
Ha! I've got some news to
break to you, old timer!

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:13.767
Ah, no. You're telling
me it landed on...

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:15.136
Yep!

[ONLOOKERS gasping]

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:29.398
Huh? Who's the dealer here?

00:07:32.104 --> 00:07:33.373
[whimpers]

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:34.776
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES whimpering]

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.128
Maybe you should get
your eyes checked out!

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:45.764
Look more carefully this time!

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.869
[LUFFY] Yep. It's white!
Congratulations, gramps!

00:07:47.902 --> 00:07:49.204
--What?
--Why don't you

00:07:49.237 --> 00:07:50.975
keep your mouth shut
and mind your own business?

Get lost!

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:53.981
Or maybe he wants
his ass kicked!

[FUJITORA]
Huh?

00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:01.830
Who does this guy think he is?

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.734
Doesn't he know
who they work for?

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.738
Got himself involved again.

00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:06.773
You seein' this?

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.977
Dude's pretending like
we're not even here!

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:11.617
You weren't pulling my
leg when you said I won?

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.086
[LUFFY]
No, you made off like a thief.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.858
Sir, I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.764
but thank you for
acting as my eyes!

00:08:20.133 --> 00:08:23.541
No sweat. I'm just
callin' it like I see it.

00:08:23.574 --> 00:08:24.543
You made the bet.

00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:26.378
Besides, you don't look
like you need help

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:27.582
defending yourself.

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:30.319
You've gone and stuck your head
where it doesn't belong!

00:08:30.353 --> 00:08:33.226
If I say it landed on black,
then it landed on black!

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.632
And he can't see anyway,
so what difference does it make

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:36.834
what color I say it is?

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:38.236
We run this joint!

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:39.939
You got that?

00:08:42.578 --> 00:08:43.848
That's odd.

00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:46.085
Seems a hog got loose
in the restaurant

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.621
and tripped over my cane.

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:51.295
[chuckles] Apologize to
the swine on my behalf.

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:53.934
You blind old fool!

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:11.135
It's a fight?
Oh, well. Excuse me.

00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:13.874
Do me a favor and please
take a step back.

[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES growl]

00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:20.721
They left me no choice.

00:09:20.754 --> 00:09:24.094
I'm gonna have to send
every one of them to hell.

[LUFFY]
Wow! That is one big hole!

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:39.031
It's not a curse to be blind
in this world of crime.

Everywhere you turn,

there's bound to be
horrendous things

hardly worth laying
your eyes upon.

Invisible fairies are
the guardians of Dressrosa

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:26.666
since ancient times
and they're our ally!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.369
When they engage in mischief,

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:30.607
the only thing to do
is turn a blind eye!

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:33.614
Well, if fairies stole from us,
I guess that's okay then!

00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:35.383
Let's forget about it!

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:36.819
Are you all mental?!

00:14:36.853 --> 00:14:39.959
The Shusui is the national
treasure of the Wano Kingdom!

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:41.996
Arg! It's my sword,
fair and square!

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:43.734
It belongs to my entire country!

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:47.106
How many times have I told you,
someone gifted it to me!

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.110
Mark my words, one day
I shall duel with you,

00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:50.714
so I might return
Shusui to Wano--

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:53.018
to the place it
rightfully belongs!

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:55.891
I accept the duel and I look
forward to beating you!

00:14:55.924 --> 00:14:57.694
[crash]

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:03.506
[ZORO]
You got too greedy, fairy!

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.977
You're not goin' anywhere!

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:07.948
[LUFFY] Zoro! Where do
ya think you're goin'?

00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:09.284
Get back here!

00:15:09.317 --> 00:15:11.590
We don't have time to let you
wander all over the city

00:15:11.623 --> 00:15:12.959
chasing after a sword!

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:14.562
I like where this is headed!

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:15.296
[laughs]

00:15:15.329 --> 00:15:16.566
[FRANKY]
Not you, Luffy!

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:17.768
Did you see the thief?

00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:19.606
I will let none
abscond from this place

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:21.008
with the national
treasure of Wano!

00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:23.680
Let go of my arm, Franky!
I wanna be a part of this!

00:15:23.713 --> 00:15:26.084
You wanna settle down and
listen to my idea first?

00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:27.120
What idea?

00:15:27.154 --> 00:15:30.894
[ZORO grunts, yells]

00:15:30.928 --> 00:15:32.831
[PATRONS chattering]

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:37.440
Now I understand.

00:15:37.473 --> 00:15:39.477
When it's just the five
of us on a mission,

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:43.452
I gotta step up and be
the adult of the group.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:46.158
[SANJI] Why is everyone trying
to be a show-off today?

00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:48.028
[yells]

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:52.538
You just leave everything
up to your ol' pal Franky.

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:11.576
I'm coming, you
bite-sized little punk!

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:14.548
Moron, stop making me chase you!

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:19.424
That sword rightfully belongs
to the Kingdom of Wano!

00:16:23.199 --> 00:16:26.639
[ZORO]
You can't get away from me!

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:29.545
Yeah? And you can't
get away from me!

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:33.318
Give me back the national
treasure of Wano!

00:16:37.294 --> 00:16:40.333
[laughing] Look at that
funny man's weird hair!

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:42.805
How dare you! Mind your tongue!

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:45.844
[KIN'EMON grunting]
I didn't realize my topknot

00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:48.415
was exposed to the public!

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:52.189
[KIN'EMON exhales]

00:17:03.045 --> 00:17:04.080
[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:14.636
Remain calm.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:17.541
I'm a grown man, not
some helpless child.

00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:19.410
But I'm lost!

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:37.314
[FRANKY] You're one of
Doflamingo's thugs, ain't cha?

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:40.754
What's your point?
We all work for Doflamingo!

00:17:40.787 --> 00:17:42.892
That's super what I thought!

00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:44.160
Yep...

00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:45.429
Just a minute.

00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:48.469
You really think I'm gonna let
a couple nobodies like you

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:51.274
try and mess with the Young
Master in Dressrosa!

00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:53.212
Huh?

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:55.016
[gasps]

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:57.821
[whimpering]

00:17:59.591 --> 00:18:01.194
I think this guy
needs to be shown

00:18:01.227 --> 00:18:02.931
what a real threat looks like.

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:05.336
Look, buddy. How 'bout
you just spill the beans

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.373
and tell us everything
we want to know, okay?

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:09.545
I swear I told you
guys everything!

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.849
I remember being ordered
to chase around a couple

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.121
of samurai, but I don't recall
how they were caught

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:17.460
or where they're currently being
held, and that's the truth!

00:18:17.493 --> 00:18:22.103
Also, I don't have
any idea what SMILE is.

00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:24.408
You sure you don't have
even the teensiest?

00:18:24.441 --> 00:18:25.844
No! And this factory?

00:18:25.877 --> 00:18:29.217
I don't know anything
about that, either!

00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:31.722
Who are you people?!

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:35.497
Man, what a bummer.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:39.003
Even his own foot soldiers
are in the dark.

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:42.310
He's too far down the ladder
to know anything important.

00:18:42.343 --> 00:18:45.650
Hey, tell us where we can
find someone higher ranking.

00:18:45.683 --> 00:18:47.453
Tch. You're gonna
have a hard time

00:18:47.486 --> 00:18:50.192
digging up anyone else to
interrogate in an alley way!

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:53.098
Everyone's been summoned to
attend the colosseum games!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.134
Just look!

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.203
[LUFFY, FRANKY]
Hm?

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:58.342
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:02.383
As you can clearly see,

00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:05.791
the entire kingdom's headed
over in that direction.

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:07.326
What direction?

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.497
To the Corrida Colosseum.

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:12.738
If you want high ranking
officials, that's the place!

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.140
And why's that?

00:19:14.174 --> 00:19:15.577
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE K]
'Cause there's a huge event

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.979
going on today.

00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:19.284
And all the family's leaders
should be in attendance,

00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:20.420
watching it go down.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:22.691
This big event everyone's
excited for--

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:26.532
what makes it such a super
occasion no one wants to miss?

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.974
For whatever reason
the Young Master

00:19:31.008 --> 00:19:32.711
is gonna offer
an incredible prize

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:34.815
to whoever wins the match.

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:38.957
Even I had my doubts
when it was announced.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.629
It's the one thing
everyone wants!

00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:44.467
[LUFFY]
Don't tell me...

00:19:44.502 --> 00:19:47.173
It's that delicious meat
Mingo was talkin' about!

00:19:47.207 --> 00:19:48.208
Huh?

00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.112
[LUFFY grunting]

00:19:50.146 --> 00:19:52.017
While he did say it's
something you'd want,

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.689
it's probably more
important than lunch.

00:19:54.722 --> 00:19:56.157
All right, out with it.

00:19:56.191 --> 00:20:01.836
Heh. I hope you're ready for a
surprise. First place gets...

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.885
[LITTLE BOY A]
Ouch!

00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:10.821
[LITTLE BOY B]
We shoulda guessed!

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:12.591
It's The Lightning Soldier!

00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:13.960
What was that for?

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:15.698
We wanna go in
the colosseum!

00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:17.668
You can't keep us out!

00:20:17.702 --> 00:20:19.471
[TOY SOLDIER]
It's not for children's eyes!

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:22.911
People are going to kill
each other here! Go home!

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:29.124
Looks like that damn
toy soldier's at it again!

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:30.661
He just won't give up!

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:31.829
[GUARDS grunting]

00:20:32.396 --> 00:20:35.603
[TOY SOLDIER]
You can't hit me! Jet walk!

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:44.187
[GYATS] Ladies and Gentlemen.
Toys and dolls. Are you ready?

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:47.594
This is no mere event you're
going to witness today!

00:20:47.627 --> 00:20:51.702
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:56.445
[GYATS]
It's one hell of an event!

00:20:56.478 --> 00:20:59.685
His majesty has entrusted us
with a most extraordinary prize

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.856
to be awarded at the
conclusion of the games!

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.227
And would you like
to know what it is?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.603
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.613
First, let's go back.

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.719
There was a great warrior who
fought in the War of the Best.

00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:19.992
He perished there two years ago.

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:22.363
What? He can't be
talkin' about...

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:25.435
The 2nd division leader of
the infamous Whitebeard Crew

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.206
and son of the King
of the Pirates.

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:30.948
The one and only Fire Fist Ace!

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:32.450
Did he just say "Ace"?

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:34.688
Yeah! He did!

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.472
Flame Commandment!

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:46.345
Fire Pillar!

00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:49.017
[GYATS] They say he could easily
smash through a warship

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.756
with his flaming punch!
And was able to burn down

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:55.731
an entire city, reducing
it to a hellscape!

00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:57.835
Dear spectators, I am
proud to announce

00:21:57.868 --> 00:22:00.306
that terrifying power has
returned to this world

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:02.644
in the form of a
Devil Fruit once again!

00:22:02.678 --> 00:22:04.280
Wait. That's how it works?

00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:06.117
That's crazy!

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.322
Feast your eyes!

00:22:08.355 --> 00:22:09.791
[CROWD cheers]

00:22:09.825 --> 00:22:11.361
[GYATS]
The winner of today's event

00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:14.334
will receive this forbidden
fruit as their prize!

00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:15.670
And it's a Logia,

00:22:15.704 --> 00:22:19.010
the most powerful type of Devil
Fruit known to humankind!

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:21.248
[CROWD gasping]

00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:21.949
No way!

00:22:21.982 --> 00:22:24.388
Is that real?

00:22:24.421 --> 00:22:27.961
[GYATS] The legendary
Flame Flame Fruit!

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:32.036
Amazing!

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.040
I don't believe it!

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.143
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:54.047
You're saying it's
the real deal?

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.652
Doflamingo would never lie
about something this huge!

00:22:56.685 --> 00:22:57.854
[LUFFY grunts]

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.463
Ace's fruit?

00:23:04.569 --> 00:23:06.772
And it's so close...

00:23:15.423 --> 00:23:17.528
[NARRATOR] The desperate battle
for the Flame Flame Fruit

00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:19.598
is about to come to a head.

00:23:19.631 --> 00:23:20.767
At the same time,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.504
Sanji has a fateful encounter

00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:25.109
with an enchanting young
Flamenco dancer.

00:23:25.142 --> 00:23:27.012
And when the two
run away together,

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:30.218
the situation becomes
even more complicated.

00:23:30.252 --> 00:23:32.122
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.156 --> 00:23:35.964
"A Dangerous Love!
The Dancer Girl--Violet!"

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:38.268
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
