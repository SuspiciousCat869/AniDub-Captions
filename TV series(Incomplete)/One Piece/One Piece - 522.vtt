WEBVTT

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.141
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.079
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.487
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.389
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.833
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.935
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.170
Scattered across the world,

00:02:37.203 --> 00:02:39.105
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.774
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:43.109
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:45.445
and move forward to next
stage of their journey:

00:02:45.478 --> 00:02:46.846
The New World.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.816
Am I mistaken, or did they
call you "Captain Luffy"?

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.117
Why wouldn't they
call me that?

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:53.987
I mean, you realize who you're
talking to right now, don't you?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.288
Go! Get outta my way

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:58.658
before I grab your intestines
and pull them out your ear!

00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:01.127
You're not Straw Hat,
you human pile of garbage.

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:02.729
Not even close!

00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:06.299
[PIRATES]
What?!

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:07.834
So that's it.

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.803
They thought that they
could join the Straw Hats

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:11.738
and enter the New World.

00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.807
And although I cannot
imagine why,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.676
the real Straw Hat is
here somewhere, too.

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.748
[LUFFY]
That was close!

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:24.784
It's... It's really
him, isn't it?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.789
[PIRATES]
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:32.759
[LUFFY]
Second Gear.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:39.132
You're way too slow.

00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:46.206
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Jet Pistol!

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:51.044
This is worse than I thought.
He's able to use Haki now.

00:03:51.077 --> 00:03:52.746
Luffy! Shoulda known!

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:54.748
All I had to do was
follow the explosions

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.516
and I knew I'd find you!

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.852
Man, it's been forever, huh?

00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:02.555
I bet everyone's so cool now!
I can't wait to see!

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.524
Ha! Uh.

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:06.593
[chuckles]

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.027
[RAYLEIGH]
I came to check on you,

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.196
but it seems you have
this under control.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.265
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh.

00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:14.200
One last thing.

00:04:14.234 --> 00:04:15.969
I'm gonna do it.

00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:23.243
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:25.311
You hear me?!

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:30.450
[LUFFY]
"Everyone Together!

00:04:30.483 --> 00:04:33.253
Luffy, Setting Out
for the New World!"

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:46.733
[HANCOCK]
Things are getting ugly.

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:50.270
If they don't move quickly,
they won't make it out alive.

00:05:09.656 --> 00:05:11.324
[chuckles]

00:05:16.963 --> 00:05:19.332
Uh! What are you doing?

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.167
Hurry up and capture
them already!

00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:23.136
[MARINES yelling]

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.938
[SANJI]
Gotta move, Luffy!

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.840
[ZORO] We appreciate
the help, Rayleigh!

00:05:26.873 --> 00:05:29.509
Well, we're off!

00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:32.045
Thanks again for everything.

00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:34.814
See ya! I'm outta here!

00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:40.987
[RAYLEIGH]
Good luck.

00:05:45.325 --> 00:05:46.993
[inaudible]

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.410
[MARINE AA]
They're on the move! After them!

00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:39.212
[MARINE BB]
Don't let 'em get away!

00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:44.117
Let nothing stop you
from reaching the top!

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:47.587
[MARINE CC]
The Straw Hats are making

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.757
a beeline for Grove 42!

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.825
Catch them at any cost!

00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.032
[MARINE B]
The hell?

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:00.366
[MARINES gasp]

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.635
[MARINE B]
Dark King Rayleigh.

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.737
Why don't you just
let the boy sail?

00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:07.440
He's been out of the game,
so take it easy.

00:07:09.842 --> 00:07:12.812
Uh. That's an intense line.

00:07:12.845 --> 00:07:14.147
If you think that's intense,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.416
then why don't you
try crossing it?

00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:24.057
[LUFFY] Whoa! That's a lot!
You really went all out!

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.392
What's inside?

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:27.794
[SANJI]
It's our food stock.

00:07:27.827 --> 00:07:29.929
I bought in bulk 'cause I'm
sure everyone's stomachs

00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:32.398
have gotten bigger
over these two years.

00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:34.233
This should keep us
all happy for a while.

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:37.770
Good thinking! I haven't had
your cooking in way too long!

00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:40.139
Over here! We found them!

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:41.574
[MARINES yelling]

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:44.277
[ZORO] Crap! They got
ahead of us somehow!

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.279
Looks like we're gonna have
to fight our way through!

00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:48.181
Charge in! We've got this!

00:07:48.214 --> 00:07:49.248
[MARINES yell]

00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:50.617
[NEGATIVE GHOST laughs]

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.651
[MARINE D]
Huh?

00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:56.356
[MARINE G]
I'm as worthless as a flea.

00:07:56.389 --> 00:07:59.692
What's wrong? Get up before--

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:02.629
Oh, no! What happened
to their morale?

00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:07.066
[NEGATIVE GHOST laughing]

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:13.606
[MARINE D ]
I... I am nothing but a louse.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.941
This sure looks familiar.

00:08:14.974 --> 00:08:17.310
[NEGATIVE GHOST laughing]

00:08:18.211 --> 00:08:22.048
[PERONA] How did I know it was
you guys causing that ruckus?

00:08:24.017 --> 00:08:26.619
So typical.

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:28.121
You're fooling around
with the Navy

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.223
when you should've
been gone long ago!

00:08:30.256 --> 00:08:34.160
Whoa! Well, aren't you
a sight for sore eyes?

00:08:34.193 --> 00:08:35.061
[LUFFY]
We know her?

00:08:35.094 --> 00:08:36.362
[ZORO]
Speak for yourself!

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:38.631
If you were smart,
you would've bailed by now!

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:40.466
You wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for me,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.468
so don't start, mister!

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:45.204
Who knows where you would've
wound up on your own?

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:49.509
The least you could do
is be gracious!

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:50.576
[PERONA yelps]

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.146
She's an actual woman.
With real life girly parts!

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:55.848
Of course I am! What the hell
is your damage, you freak?

00:08:55.882 --> 00:08:58.151
All right, enough of this.
You guys need to get moving.

00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:01.721
There's Navy ships nearby,
so you're running out of time!

00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.323
If you don't get out of here
soon, you'll never escape.

00:09:04.357 --> 00:09:07.660
[SANJI] While that is bad,
we have a bigger problem.

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:09.696
I can't seem to move
from this spot at all.

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:12.031
Would you mind not being
a total creepazoid?

00:09:12.065 --> 00:09:13.433
[SANJI]
I can't help myself!

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:17.003
--[PERONA screams]
--Take me!

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:19.872
[SANJI]
I'm lower than earthworm poop.

00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:22.775
[LUFFY]
What's that?

00:09:22.809 --> 00:09:25.278
[CHOPPER]
I finally found you guys!

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.715
[chuckles]

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:36.766
[BROOK laughing]

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:38.100
Look who's here!

00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:46.642
[BROOK]
Usopp! Nami! Robin! Franky!

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:49.445
Yo-hoo!

00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.013
All right! You're here!

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:52.114
What a surprise!

00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:55.351
I didn't think you'd
abandon stardom! Attaboy!

00:09:55.384 --> 00:09:57.086
[laughs]

00:09:57.119 --> 00:09:58.754
Nothing could keep me
from coming back.

00:09:58.788 --> 00:10:00.589
I've missed you all so.

00:10:00.623 --> 00:10:02.525
I see that you two have
only grown lovelier

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:04.160
in our time apart.

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:08.597
[BROOK]
With all that in mind,

00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:10.800
there's something
I need to know.

00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:15.304
Ooh. It's already
song time, huh?

00:10:18.975 --> 00:10:21.477
Please, Nami.
May I look at your panties?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.045
[NAMI]
No way in hell!

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:24.880
I never let you look
at them two years ago,

00:10:24.914 --> 00:10:26.215
why would I let you
see them now?

00:10:26.248 --> 00:10:28.784
Right. I was just
excited to see you.

00:10:28.818 --> 00:10:30.453
It made my soul shake.

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:31.988
And it's still
shaking right now.

00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:34.056
In fact, it's about to leak
out of my ear, I think...

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.958
[USOPP] I didn't think you
could have a muscle spasm

00:10:35.992 --> 00:10:37.393
without any muscles.

00:10:37.426 --> 00:10:38.794
Seriously?

00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:42.798
How is it none of you have grown
up after all of this time?

00:10:42.832 --> 00:10:44.734
[BROOK]
Rejection aside,

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:47.803
I was actually expecting
to be the last one here.

00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:49.638
Don't worry,
Chopper is off looking

00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:51.073
for our missing companions.

00:10:51.107 --> 00:10:52.908
[LUFFY]
Hey!

00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:00.883
Talk about perfect timing!

00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:03.686
[LUFFY]
Guys!

00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:08.124
Hey!

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:11.994
Told you I would find 'em!

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:13.529
[USOPP, BROOK, NAMI laughing]

00:11:13.562 --> 00:11:16.499
[USOPP]
Luffy! Zoro! Sanji!

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:19.268
Hey!

00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:20.936
[chuckles]

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.874
Together again! I've been
waiting for this day!

00:11:24.907 --> 00:11:27.777
And everyone looks
stronger! I like it!

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.012
[chuckles]

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:32.415
It feels like it's been forever!

00:11:32.448 --> 00:11:35.518
[LUFFY laughs]

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:37.720
Looks like we're the last--

00:11:37.753 --> 00:11:40.756
Hi, guys!

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:47.930
--[sputtering]
--[CHOPPER gasps]

00:11:47.963 --> 00:11:48.964
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

00:11:48.998 --> 00:11:51.133
[CHOPPER screams]

00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:53.903
[CHOPPER]
He's hemorrhaging!

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:01.377
[CHOPPER]
Thanks a lot for the ride!

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.946
Tell everyone back in the
Birdie Kingdom I say "hi."

00:12:03.979 --> 00:12:05.714
[BIRDIE A caws]

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:08.050
How is he? Has the
bleeding stopped yet?

00:12:08.084 --> 00:12:11.454
Not one... but two beautiful
women in front of me...

00:12:11.487 --> 00:12:13.756
Stay with me, man.
Don't give up yet!

00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:16.559
It's no good, Chopper! He's
getting paler by the second!

00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:21.330
Ah! You... look...
so cool, Franky!

00:12:21.363 --> 00:12:23.766
Yeah, you think so? Good!

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:27.603
But even if you didn't, I could
change my style at will. Mecha!

00:12:27.636 --> 00:12:29.405
"Mecha"? Let me try!

00:12:29.438 --> 00:12:30.739
[NAMI]
Okay, focus!

00:12:30.773 --> 00:12:33.109
This is no time to
be fooling around!

00:12:33.142 --> 00:12:34.577
We need to get outta
here while we can

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.846
before the Navy's on top of us!

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:38.114
[gasps]

00:12:38.147 --> 00:12:39.448
[STRAW HATS yelp]

00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:43.452
No, it looks like
we're too late!

00:12:43.486 --> 00:12:45.521
I see three Navy ships.

00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:50.493
If we don't do something fast,

00:12:50.526 --> 00:12:51.760
we're gonna be
dead in the water!

00:12:51.794 --> 00:12:55.030
[MARINE H] Fire! Sink
that ship at all costs!

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:00.703
Oh, no. They're gonna hit!

00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:07.176
[HANCOCK]
Slave... Arrow!

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.282
What? They stopped in midair.

00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:15.484
Wait. Captain.

00:13:17.987 --> 00:13:19.989
[MARINE I]
It's the Kuja Pirates!

00:13:22.324 --> 00:13:25.361
[HANCOCK]
Answer me this, knaves.

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:28.531
Which one of you
had the audacity

00:13:28.564 --> 00:13:31.901
to place your disgusting
ship in my path?

00:13:54.623 --> 00:13:57.059
That flag... It can't be.

00:13:57.092 --> 00:13:58.327
You know it?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.728
[ROBIN]
That's the Kuja symbol.

00:13:59.762 --> 00:14:01.363
They're a strong
crew of Amazonians

00:14:01.397 --> 00:14:03.232
lead by one of the
Seven Warlords.

00:14:03.265 --> 00:14:04.233
You're joking, right?

00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:06.502
Not at all. Her name
is Boa Hancock.

00:14:06.535 --> 00:14:08.404
They say anyone who
lays eyes on her

00:14:08.437 --> 00:14:10.839
will be enamored by her
beauty and turned to stone,

00:14:10.873 --> 00:14:12.007
unless she grants you mercy.

00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:14.543
[BROOK]
Whoa! Oh, I can see why!

00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:16.378
Beauty starts and ends with her!

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:18.113
If I had eyes,
they'd be sparkling!

00:14:18.147 --> 00:14:21.016
Oh, wow! She's like
a real-life goddess!

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:22.017
[gasps]

00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:24.720
Is she really that
fine? Lemme see!

00:14:24.753 --> 00:14:27.456
My goddess. Where?
Gotta find her.

00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:29.959
I wanna see. I wanna. I wanna.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.562
He's as hard as a rock!

00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:35.431
[LUFFY] Hancock said she
wasn't comin' here.

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:36.966
[USOPP, SANJI, BROOK]
Huh?

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:39.468
[MARINE H] We order you to move
your ship outta the way!

00:14:39.501 --> 00:14:42.137
You're interfering with
official Navy business!

00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:44.240
It's your ship
that's in my way.

00:14:44.273 --> 00:14:45.574
So I suppose it's you that's

00:14:45.608 --> 00:14:47.476
"interfering with official
Navy business."

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:50.045
Uh. That's really an
immature argument.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.280
I get what I want.

00:14:51.313 --> 00:14:53.282
[MARINES gasp]

00:14:53.315 --> 00:14:56.552
[HANCOCK] Go, Luffy.
I've bought you some time.

00:14:56.585 --> 00:14:57.553
Ah!

00:14:57.586 --> 00:15:01.223
She winked at us!
I could die of ecstasy!

00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:02.424
[LUFFY]
Looks like we have an opening.

00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:03.492
Let's set sail!

00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:05.661
Do you know that
Warlord or something?

00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:07.263
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I made friends with her

00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:09.832
when that bear guy sent
me to Amazon Lily.

00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:12.835
You mean the legendary island
where only women live?

00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:14.937
I never believed it
was a real place.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.073
You've been pallin' around
with the Pirate Empress?

00:15:18.107 --> 00:15:19.341
Come clean, now!

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:20.643
You weren't really
training at all

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:22.244
these past two years, were you?

00:15:22.278 --> 00:15:23.579
What else would
I have been doin'?

00:15:23.612 --> 00:15:25.748
[SANJI]
Damn! It's not fair!

00:15:25.781 --> 00:15:27.316
That would've been a
dream come true for me!

00:15:27.349 --> 00:15:28.749
[LUFFY]
What's his problem?

00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:34.700
[MARGARET] Wow! So those
are Luffy's friends!

00:15:34.734 --> 00:15:37.870
I've never seen so many strange
creatures together before.

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:38.571
There's one...

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.340
They look like such a fun crew!

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:44.310
[NAMI] Okay! Everyone in
position to set sail!

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.146
--Aye-aye!
--[SANJI] Yes, Nami-swan!

00:15:47.179 --> 00:15:49.048
[CHOPPER]
What's the matter, Usopp?

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.816
Something just occurred to me.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.185
You never said you beat
the Navy soldiers inland.

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:54.320
We didn't.

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.222
We just flew past them,
but we could hear them shouting

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.491
from behind us in the distance.

00:15:58.524 --> 00:15:59.825
[USOPP]
Then what could be stopping them

00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:01.627
from coming after us?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.668
[MARINES yelling]

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:13.105
This is backup unit Platoon
Three! Do you copy?

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.407
[MARINES scream]

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.208
[MARINE L] We read you.
What's happening?

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:19.011
[MARINE K] We are unable
to reach Grove 42!

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:20.012
[MARINE L]
What? Why?

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.114
[MARINE K]
Well, because...

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.550
There are giant bugs currently
halting our advance.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:25.851
[MARINE L]
Wait, giant what?

00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:29.188
[MARINE K screaming]

00:16:29.221 --> 00:16:31.290
These things are monsters!

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.228
[MARINE DD]
Shoot it!

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:41.067
[screams]

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:45.037
[HERACLES] I won't let
anyone get in the way

00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:47.573
of Usopp'n goin' adventurin'.

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:48.908
[HERACLES sniffs]

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:53.946
[HERACLES] Men don't shed
tears when they part ways!

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:57.249
Good Luck, Usopp'n.

00:16:59.251 --> 00:17:01.287
[FRANKY] Who cares why they
aren't comin' after us?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.056
The worse their lives are,
the better ours'll be.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.559
Heh. It's time to
get outta here.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.894
Nami, lead the way.

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:10.262
[NAMI]
You got it.

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:12.832
All right.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:16.402
[MARINE M]
This is Platoon Four.

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.003
Afraid I have bad news.

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:21.407
All our gunpowder has been
ruined by a sudden rain shower.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.009
[MARINE EE]
What?! That isn't possible.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.846
The forecast for Sabaody
Archipelago today

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.948
is clear and sunny!

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.086
[HAREDAS]
Thunder would be excessive.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.989
After all, we don't wanna
scare the civilians, now.

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:40.326
I wasn't expecting those bubbles
to give us so much grief.

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.928
Bubbles or not, you can't
complain about the wind.

00:17:42.962 --> 00:17:44.763
No, sir, that breeze got us

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:46.765
where we wanted to be
right on schedule.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.033
Well, of course it did!

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.836
When it's something for Nami,
she gets nothing but the best.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.438
[laughs]

00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:54.507
[ALL laugh]

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.109
[HAREDAS] We'll miss you on
Weatheria, young lady.

00:17:57.143 --> 00:18:00.346
But get out there
and give it your all!

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.764
Hey! What's it doin'?

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.335
Are we sure this is
supposed to inflate?

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:30.009
[CHOPPER] Whoa! Now our
boat's got a bubble roof!

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.410
This is how it works.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.146
A ship that is properly coated
has the ability to withstand

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.648
almost any sort of pressure,

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:37.716
but it also has very
little buoyancy.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.151
The floating bag
beneath the ship

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:41.220
is the only thing
keeping us afloat.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.822
By deflating it, the Sunny
will become less buoyant

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.191
and begin to sink.

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:46.926
It's pretty simple, really.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.494
[BOTH]
Huh. Interesting.

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:49.828
[NAMI]
Maybe not simple enough.

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.931
Forget about it for now,
let's spread the sail!

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:52.898
[BROOK, CHOPPER]
Why?

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.567
We use it to catch
the water current,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.169
similar to how we would use
the wind above sea level.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:19:00.606
I was hopin' we'd just sink
down to Fishman Island. Darn.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.807
[NAMI]
All right!

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.843
We'd better hurry unless we
wanna get in another fight!

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:08.347
[MARINE N] This is Central Unit
Platoon Five at Grove 42!

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.848
We have an emergency!

00:19:09.882 --> 00:19:11.684
The troops from Platoon
Two have been found,

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:14.053
but they've all succumbed
to a severe depression!

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:17.189
[MARINE O] Tell 'em to suck it
up and get back in the fight!

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:20.025
[MARINE GG] I suck. I should've
been born a water flea.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:21.360
[MARINE N]
What we've been able to gather

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:24.363
is that Straw Hat Luffy
flew off on a giant bird.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.798
[MARINE O]
So he's not even there?

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.800
Then what are you
guys shooting at?

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.134
[MARINE N]
We are currently under attack

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.070
by unknown enemies!

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.038
[PERONA]
Tch. What a jerk!

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:34.306
After all I've done for him,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.275
he's given me
nothing but trouble.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.478
I really should go find a
new boy-toy to play with.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:48.454
[CHOPPER]
Reinforcements got here quick.

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.456
We were just about to leave.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:51.857
Heads up!

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.895
[MARINE P] The Straw Hat
ship is now within range!

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.797
Uh. But we may have a problem!

00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:01.467
A large bird is heading
straight for us!

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.645
Oh, wow!

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:13.812
[gasps]

00:20:13.846 --> 00:20:15.481
From behind, too?

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:16.715
[SANJI]
I got it!

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:20.819
[SANJI]
Like what ya see, Nami?

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:25.357
I've gotten a lot stronger.
Go ahead and take it in.

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:27.793
--[sputtering]
--No, not again!

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:33.032
[MARINE Q] Platoon Five,
come in! What's going on?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:35.134
[MARINE R]
Well, it isn't good.

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.535
We've hit interference.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.470
We couldn't possibly
have anticipated this.

00:20:38.504 --> 00:20:41.140
[MARINE HH]
Ah! Have mercy!

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:43.942
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:46.812
How could you ever think of
turning beauties like us away?

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:47.980
As if!

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:50.049
[GREEN HAIR QUEEN]
Maybe they're all shy.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:53.485
[PINK HAIR QUEEN] There's
nothing to be ashamed of, boys!

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:57.289
Let's have a cup of tea!
And cookies, too!

00:20:57.323 --> 00:21:01.327
How awful! Truly, this
is worse than death!

00:21:03.829 --> 00:21:06.899
Hi, there! You've got
such an adorable face!

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.967
[MARINE R]
Ah! No! Let me go!

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.403
[MARINES yelling]

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:12.471
[MARINE Q]
What's wrong now?

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:15.808
Platoon Five,
finish your report!

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:19.078
[ELIZABETH] This is for you,
Sanji. Make it count!

00:21:20.179 --> 00:21:21.113
[chokes]

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:23.716
Whoa, whoa! Take it
easy, Sanji! Breathe!

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.251
Oh. Usopp. It's you.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:27.986
Sorry, it felt like
someone had gotten

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.255
a death grip on my heart.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.256
Bag's deflated!

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.692
Awesome! You guys ready?

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:36.328
[ZORO]
Yeah, we're all set!

00:21:36.362 --> 00:21:37.663
[LUFFY]
That it, Nami?

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.432
Yeah. Just say the
word, Captain.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.470
[USOPP chuckles]

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:51.977
[LUFFY]
All right.

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:59.184
Listen up, guys!

00:21:59.218 --> 00:22:01.854
There's a lot I wanna say,
but we don't have much time.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:03.555
One thing can't wait, though.

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:06.558
What you went through these past
two years was selfish of me,

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:08.360
so thanks for
puttin' up with it.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:10.929
You make it sound like this
has never happened before.

00:22:10.963 --> 00:22:12.197
That's no joke!

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:14.733
You've always been a
selfish piece of work.

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.269
[laughs]

00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:22.708
[MARINE T] Rear Admiral!
The pirate ship is submerging!

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.042
We can't wait!

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:27.880
Listen, you have no idea how
dangerous those pirates are!

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:30.315
Move your ship! Now.
Pretty please?

00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:32.751
[MARINES]
Yes, please?

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:36.088
[HANCOCK]
Take care of yourself, Luffy.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.392
[LUFFY]
Spread the sail!

00:22:40.426 --> 00:22:41.427
[BROOK, ZORO, CHOPPER]
Right!

00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:52.404
Let's go!

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:55.007
[STRAW HATS]
Yeah!

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.716
[LUFFY]
We're off to Fishman Island!

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:17.196
[NARRATOR]
Encased in a protective bubble,

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:21.099
the Sunny departs for Fisman
Island far under the sea.

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.202
As the Straw Hats marvel
at the sights,

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:25.337
Franky tells a tale of
the man who proved to be

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.674
the crew's greatest ally
in their time apart.

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:32.778
Then, suddenly, a mysterious
shadow closes in on the ship.

00:23:32.811 --> 00:23:34.279
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:37.649
"A Surprising Fact! The Man
Who Guarded the Sunny!"

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:40.152
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
