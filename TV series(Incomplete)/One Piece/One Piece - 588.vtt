[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.465
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:10.135
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.345
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.472
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.308
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.561
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.731
[NARRATOR] Now, those who
dare to dream hoist their flags

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.191

for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:42.537
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.831
These wild and dangerous
seas are known

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.709
as the New World.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.878
Gold Roger and his
crew were the only men

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:51.671
to ever chart these
waters and learn

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.548
all the secrets they held.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.425
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.886
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.804
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.600
[NARRATOR]
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.727

the Gum-Gum Fruit,
sets sail into the New World

with his faithful crew.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:13.902

[NARRATOR] After a fierce battle
at the bottom of the sea,

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.076
the Straw Hat Pirates depart
for the deadly waters

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:25.872
of the New World,
ruled by the Four Emperors.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.916
Receiving a distress call,
the crew lands

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.793
on Punk Hazard, an island
split into two sections

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.587
with extremely
different climates--

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.089
the Burning Lands
and the Ice Lands.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.760
They're enemies with
Smoker of the Navy.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.929
That gives us a perfect
excuse to wipe out

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.431
both groups of troublemakers
and shift the blame.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.808
Why, we may keep
our secrets yet!

This plan.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.275
Must be why you joined up with
the Seven Warlords, isn't it?

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:55.985
But what the hell are you after?

[LAW] If ya wanna get to
the bottom of something,

then ya gotta broaden
your horizons.

Or you'll miss the truth!

You can beg, but I
don't have to tell you

No! Don't do it, Cap'n!

That guy's way too strong.

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.539
I refuse to retreat! Let go!

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.417
I joined the Navy
to fight, dammit!

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:35.877
Go anywhere near him,
and you're only gonna

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.378
get chopped up again.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:39.756

Don't stop now, Crocotaur!
We're almost there!

What is that?

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:00.151
[USOPP]
A ship?

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.946
Yep. Sure looks like a warship.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.074
So the Navy's on the island?

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.533
What? Are you sure?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.078
When did they get here?

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.789
What's going on?
I need to get to the master!

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.417
Hey, look, we've got company.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.711
[LUFFY]
Wait... I know him!

Hey! Hello!

Whatcha doin' here?

00:06:22.507 --> 00:06:24.467
You remember me, don't you?

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.970
You helped me out that one time.

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:29.597
Straw Hat.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.766
He's here?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.643
That's the guy we met
at the Human Shoppe

00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:35.478
in Sabaody.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.272
Trafalgar Law.
But why's he here?

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.150
[LUFFY]
Right. Traffy!

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.277
He helped me out, you guys know.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.071
Back in the Battle
of Marineford.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.241
He got me off the field
and treated my wounds.

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:49.200
He did?

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.619
Yeah, sure.
He saved my life, like Jimbei.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.330
Okay. I'm gonna go talk
to him right now!

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.790
Hey!

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:02.171
I didn't expect to run into you.
Small world, huh?

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:04.173
You saved me. I owe ya one.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.633

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:09.011
Hey, wait. Uh...
Where'd your buddies go?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.308
[LAW]
Quick! Hand over Straw Hat!

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.644
Hand him over and we can escape.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.813
He'll die without my help.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:20.982
Trust me. I'm a doctor.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:25.945
Where's my brother?!

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.530
What will happen
to him if he remains

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:28.823
in that state?

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:29.824
Simple.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.285
If he keeps flailing around,

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:34.495
the more likely he is
to open his wound.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.790
And if that happens,
chances are he'll die.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:38.958
He needs to rest.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.209
For two weeks, at least.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.128
Got it? Or he won't heal.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.504
I understand.

00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:44.839
And thank you for everything.

[LAW] It looks like you
pulled through, Straw Hat.

Well, glad my treatment took,

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.184
but you don't have
to thank me for it.

00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:59.020
I did it on a whim, that's all.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.646
We're not buddies.

00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:03.316
Don't forget,
we're both pirates.

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:05.318
[LUFFY chuckles]
I know.

Opponents, rivals, enemies,
but enemy or not,

Can I get a little help
here, Trafalgar?

Please wake up!

[LUFFY]
That's what I thought.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.719
It's Smokey and his crew.

I need you all to place
a leaf upon your heads.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:34.962
What? Why would we do that?

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.422
Don't joke, dude.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.091
The poor kiddos are gonna
collapse from the cold.

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.760
Besides. What leaves?

00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:42.636
There aren't any.
Just look around.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:43.804
There are no plants.

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.264
Fine. Forget leaves.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.433
Start gathering
some stones instead.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.434
Hurry!

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.935
[CHILDREN whimper]

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.270
Okay, we'll do it,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.481
but this had better
not be a prank.

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.149
I'll get 'em for the kids too.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.490
[CHILDREN gasp]

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:04.575
Now what?
We've got the rocks.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.410
I hope you don't do
some stupid spell,

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.829
like "abracadabra,
make it not cold."

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:09.997
'Cause I'd kill ya.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:11.290
All right!

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.500
[grunting]

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:13.626
Huh?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.841
Poof!

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:26.305
[ALL]
Huh?! What's this?

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.484
I've got a coat and boots now!
Awesome!

00:13:38.526 --> 00:13:40.152
But how? What did you do?

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:42.530
Gloves, too!

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:44.198
I'm all warm now!

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.366
Thanks, samurai!

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:46.867
You're welcome, small one.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.328
I have not always possessed
this strange ability.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:53.332
But one day, I ate a fruit.
An unusual one.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:54.375
And since then,

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.335
I have been able to disguise
myself and others

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.003
as I please.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.672
I know little
of foreign clothing.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:01.549
I hope this will suffice.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.551
Also, due to the nature
of the magic,

00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:05.970
the clothes will disappear
if you remove them.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:10.891
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.351
He covered my boobs.

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.979
I didn't know you'd
eaten a Devil Fruit.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.981
What? Devil?

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:19.859
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
Hey, hold on a second.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.901
[CHILDREN]
Huh?

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:23.153
This whole time,
you had that power.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.239
So why didn't you use it sooner?

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.574
[CHILDREN yell]

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:29.493
I was helpless.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.203
That little breast band
she's wearing...

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.539
I couldn't bring myself
to cover it up.

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.749
[NAMI (FRANKY) gasps]
You perv!

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:38.878
[KIN'EMON grunts]

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:44.049
That... really... itches!

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:49.179
Jeez. Say it. "I'm hurt."

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:51.557
Admitting that isn't
going to kill you.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.392
I itch...

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:55.936
[LUFFY]
Oh, hey! Look who it is!

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:56.937
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?

00:14:56.979 --> 00:14:59.148
--Hi, guys!
--[BROOK] Hello!

Hey! Hey!

[laughing]

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.505
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
What are they doing here?

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:27.051
Hi! Everyone okay?
Yo ho ho ho ho ho!

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:30.679
Dude, now what?

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.849
Hey, it's Luffy!
Zoro and Usopp, too.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.353
Robin! Brook!
I'm so happy to see you!

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.395
What the--?

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.981
Why's the jackass cook
prancing around like that?

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:43.067
Cold does strange
things to people.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.986
[CHOPPER (SANJI) laughing]

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:48.530
Is it just me or are
there giant children

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:49.573
with them, too?

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.036
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Huh?!

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.871
Huh? Wait! No, don't do it!

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.748
Franky! Down, boy!

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.792
[SANJI (NAMI)]
Hello.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.379
[GROUP gasps]

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:09.885
[USOPP sighs]

00:16:09.927 --> 00:16:12.721
Out of the cold! Finally!

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.348
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)]
This building reminds me a lot

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.683
of the other one.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:17.267
[ROBIN]
But this one is badly damaged,

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.687
as if there were some
sort of explosion here.

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:21.355
[FRANKY (CHOPPER)] Long as it
gets us out of that blizzard,

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:22.898
it's fine by me.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.526
Now. Let's talk. Who's up first?

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:27.736
[NAMI (FRANKY) sobs]
I can't believe I did that to my

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:29.279
own body!

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.407
Here.
Let me see if I can help.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.535
What are you doing, Sanji?

00:16:34.576 --> 00:16:36.245
Get your hands off me!

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.330
But, it's me, Chopper.

00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:43.752
[KIN'EMON laughs]

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:46.755
My legs are back!
I'm almost whole now!

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.590
[laughs]

00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:50.426
[LUFFY]
My extra legs!

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:52.553
I'm not a centaur anymore!

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:57.474
--[LUFFY crying]
--[KIN'EMON laughing]

00:16:57.516 --> 00:17:00.769
Enough! You were never
a centaur, so just let it go!

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:02.604
How very odd.

00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:06.775
[KIN'EMON laughing]

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:10.070
Yo ho ho ho!
Quite a funny chap, isn't he?

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:11.405
The skeleton...

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:12.698
...is talking.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.036
Nami-Sanji. You okay?

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.083
I think so.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.544
But I was just having
the strangest dream.

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.506
I was floating down a river
that flowed between

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:32.342
giant boobs.

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:35.304
Really?! That's what you're
dreaming about?!

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.807
[NAMI (FRANKY) crying]

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.434
Hey! Do a trick!

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:41.810
Yeah, the tank thing!

00:17:41.852 --> 00:17:46.356
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.733
Not now!

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.569
Right. That's not him.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:56.450
[SANJI (NAMI)]
You sure?

00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:58.160
You've gotta be craving one.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:17:59.286
Go on.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.497
I know you like to smoke
when you're stressed out.

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:02.664
So smoke.

00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:06.335
Right. First up, we're gonna
need to know who's who here.

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:09.046
Franky. Got that? Not Chopper.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.840
You get hurt, I'm useless.
Remember that.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.009
Hey, guys.
Chopper speaking.

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:17.387
If you have any injures,
come to me.

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:18.889
I'm Nami. 'Kay?

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:22.101
No laser beams.
No tanks. Don't ask.

00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:27.523
[SANJI (NAMI)]
And now, I present to you...

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.566
Nami! Yeah!

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:32.486
Well, hello, beautiful!

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.530
[NAMI (FRANKY)]
Defile my body again.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.697
I dare you.

00:18:35.739 --> 00:18:36.907
[SANJI (NAMI) gasps]

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.158
I'll stop, I promise!

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.744
Please don't hurt Nami again!
She's too pretty!

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.037
[CHOPPER (SANJI)]
No, don't do it!

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.539
That would be suicide!

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.708
Touch me and you get a fine.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.837
One hundred thousand berries.
No, make it two.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.213
[SANJI (NAMI)]
But my dream!

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.340
[laughing]

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:54.341
Shut up!

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:56.218
Wouldn't be so funny
if it happened to you!

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.264
[USOPP] Let's start from
the top and make sure

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.224
we've got it straight.

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:05.769
This head and legs belong
to a Wano samurai.

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.563
The distress signal
we intercepted before

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.439
coming to the island
was actually meant

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:11.775
for the big boss Crocotaur
and was sent by

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.402
one of his men.

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:16.864
Seems our sliced-up samurai pal
did some slicing of his own,

00:19:16.905 --> 00:19:19.908
with the centaurs
on the receiving end.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.120
Yes. I fought them,
but only to rescue my son.

00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:24.913
His name is Momonosuke.

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:27.374
He's missing,
and those men were in my way.

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:28.417
Just look.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.043
You can see with your
own eyes how many

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:32.921
children were prisoners
in that foul facility.

00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:35.215
I have no doubt my son
is one of them.

00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:38.802
Yeah. There were others.
More children like us.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.762
I guess your son could
be one of them.

00:19:40.804 --> 00:19:43.265
But I don't know.

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:46.768
Right, but what happened
after that distress signal?

00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:48.395
Who the heck sliced you?

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.981
The man we encountered. Him.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.442
The one with the cold eyes
and the silly cap

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.904
who bears the title "Warlord."

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.947
Say what?!

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:00.240
Wait. Traffy?

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.576
He's a Warlord now, really?

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.996
[ROBIN] Yes. Well, a lot
can change in two years.

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:06.955
Bastard.

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:09.124
He took his blade
and carved me up.

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:14.755
My head was kept
in the facility.

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:17.090
My torso remained where it fell.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:21.136
And my legs were chased
away by a vile beast.

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.680
They were making
a valiant effort to escape

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.350
when they became
stuck on something.

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:28.101
Which was the dragon.

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.270
That explains it.

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:33.023
Oh, right, a Warlord.
You were mad at one.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.149
I remember now.

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:35.859
Wait, but it was just legs.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.694
So how did he talk?

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:41.031
That's a real good question.

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:43.825
It's simple. By farting.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.580
It's a talent of mine.
Here, I'll show you.

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:52.000
Fart-talking? Okay, gross!

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.669
But useful.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.171
[LUFFY]
Didn't smell so bad outside.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:57.464
[BROOK]
Yo ho ho ho ho!

00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:00.550
Would you believe I met another
partial person recently?

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:03.011
You have a head and legs.

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.346
He had just a torso.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:05.639
Ha! That's funny.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.475
Right, 'cause that was
his torso, dumbass.

00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.394
[BROOK gasps]
Oh, dear!

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:12.688
You saw it, skeleton? Truly?

00:21:12.729 --> 00:21:13.981
Where is my torso?

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.440
We must go there at once!

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:23.282
[MARINES]
Uh...

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:30.706
Uh... so... now you're Tashigi?

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:36.044
Y-Yes.

00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:37.879
[MARINES]
What?! No way!

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:39.381
This cannot be happening!

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.008
So the two of them got switched?

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:43.385
This is too weird.
So you're a guy now?

00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.846
And um, the whole heart thing.

00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:47.931
You doing okay without one?

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.725
I think so.

00:21:49.766 --> 00:21:52.060
[MARINE K] Talking to her
is hard enough, but...

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.228
Smokey?

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.734
Oh. Dear god. T-The horror!

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.610
I can never un-see that.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.070
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)] There
was a ship hidden beside

00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:03.405
the laboratory.

00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:06.074
The letters C.C.
were written on it.

00:22:06.116 --> 00:22:08.577
What?
I didn't know there was a ship.

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:10.287
You saw it, Vice Admiral?

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.246
[SMOKER (TASHIGI)]
Yeah.

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:12.873
If it was left over
from the old days

00:22:12.914 --> 00:22:14.416
before the island was destroyed,

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:17.961
the mark should be P.H.
for Punk Hazard.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.591
I'm guessing that Law
isn't the mastermind here.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:23.925
Someone else is.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:28.597
Someone with the initials C.C.,
and I think I know who.

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.601
It would make sense.

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:34.811
Him being here on this island.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.359
A lot of things are
starting to fall into place.

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:52.079
I believe the person behind
this is a former colleague

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.955
of Dr. Vegapunk.

00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.626
A scientist named Caesar Clown.

00:22:59.836 --> 00:23:03.131
Heavens. What have you
done now, Law? Well?

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:11.139
If anyone's got
a complaint, it's me.

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:12.140
Caesar!

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.605
[NARRATOR]
To everyone's surprise,

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.982
the ruler of Punk Hazard
is a highly admired

00:23:21.024 --> 00:23:23.819
figure in the
ferocious New World.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.946
While the Straw Hat are
still reeling over this

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:28.323
newly discovered revelation,

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:31.118
Smoker inches closer to
uncovering the secret

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:33.328
of the master's true form.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.038
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.126
"The Worst in the World!
A Scientist of Terror - Caesar!"

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:41.837
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
