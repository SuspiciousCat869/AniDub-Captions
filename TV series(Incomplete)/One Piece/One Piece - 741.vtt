WEBVTT

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:37.448
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.497
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.936
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.309
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.213
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.417
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.591
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.532
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.335
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.585
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.430
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats formed
a pirate alliance with Law

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.802
and defeated
the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.239
who had seized
control of Dressrosa.

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.378
Now, at last,
the kingdom is at peace.

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.151
[TSURU]
Admiral Fujitora.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.489
Why haven't you
seized that pirate?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.394
You've confirmed that he's here.
So what's the holdup?

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:37.401
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.640
To us, he's a wanted man.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.577
To them, a hero.

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:43.280
Should I bring him in?

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:47.555
Or let him walk,
because he saved this kingdom?

00:03:47.655 --> 00:03:50.628
The decision weighs
heavily on my mind.

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:52.732
Huh?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.972
Oh, right! About your dad.

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:57.074
We've heard talk!

00:03:57.174 --> 00:03:58.544
[gasps]

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:01.583
He was a prince
from some faraway land!

00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:05.692
And rumor has it, that prince
and your mother eloped!

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:08.597
But then, the prince
was killed in the war.

00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:10.668
Isn't that just terrible?

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:13.040
So Lady Scarlet and Rebecca--

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.243
I mean, Lady Rebecca,

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:17.582
ended up living
undercover in Dressrosa.

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:20.788
What a bizarre rumor!

00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:22.425
We know for certain
that Sir Kyros

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:25.063
is the maiden's
father, do we not?

00:04:25.163 --> 00:04:28.035
[KYROS] I was the person
who got that rumor started.

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.776
It's because of my past.

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.252
[KYROS] I was a criminal,
and someone of my low breeding

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.356
could never marry royalty.

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:43.065
This is... better for her.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:45.838
[LUFFY]
No it isn't!

00:04:45.938 --> 00:04:48.510
Does Rebecca know
about all this stuff?

00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:53.453
She must've read my note.

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.858
I told her the honest truth
about my whole life.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.601
[FUJITORA]
So it's a six, then.

00:05:01.435 --> 00:05:03.339
This is providence!

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.176
All troops, advance!

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:09.118
Find the Straw Hats and Law,
and then capture them!

00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:12.357
Also, arrest every criminal
that's within the palace.

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:14.796
Let's bring all of them down!

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.788
[BASTILLE] The only way
they can escape is by sea.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:47.127
And we've already taken control
of all the ports in town.

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.864
We've got men everywhere!

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.437
There's no place left
for them to run.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.547
Go! I want all of you
on high alert!

00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:57.480
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.189
I suppose I'll leave
the rest to you, then.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.625
[BASTILLE]
Right!

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.365
[KYROS]
They're on their way now!

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:07.869
We need to prepare quick!

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.476
[gasps] Our luck has run out!

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:12.945
There's nothing left to prepare,

00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:15.551
we ensured we were ready
to escape days ago.

00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:17.889
We were waiting for
Sir Luffy to awaken.

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.159
Yes. Though it worked
in our favor,

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.567
I must admit it was strange that
they didn't come for us earlier.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.370
There's just one problem.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.041
We are in need of a vessel!

00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.044
That means we're dead!

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:31.348
We're not getting
anywhere without a ship!

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:32.818
Hey, Leo!

00:06:32.918 --> 00:06:34.421
Have you carried out
the request I made?

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:39.666
Yes, of course, sir.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.469
I followed your
instructions to the letter!

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:44.374
Keep your distance,
it's too dangerous!

00:06:44.942 --> 00:06:46.646
[MARINE B]
We're here to capture pirates!

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:48.015
Stay out of the way!

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.322
No! They'll get Lucy!

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:52.424
[TOWNSMAN A]
Uh-oh.

00:06:57.868 --> 00:07:00.641
Some of the Marines are
heading up to the Palace, too!

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.745
All of the fighters
will need help!

00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:06.085
Aw! Thanks for your
concern, little pal!

00:07:06.185 --> 00:07:08.591
But don't worry, we've been
keeping an eye out for the Navy

00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.529
ourselves this whole time,
so it'll be all right!

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:12.933
[LEO]
That's good!

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:16.674
Time to get going!
I'll lead the way!

00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:19.513
We're gonna make a beeline
for the port in the east!

00:07:19.613 --> 00:07:20.948
[USOPP]
Hey, wait!

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:22.585
They've got Marines
all over the city!

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.221
We can't just plow
right through them!

00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:25.558
That's no sweat!

00:07:26.092 --> 00:07:27.629
We knew you'd be
ready to skip town

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.465
as soon as everybody was awake,

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:33.039
so our people are set up in
strategic places to help you!

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.711
They've been on standby
for a while now!

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:37.748
They'll clear a path
for you, easy!

00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:43.159
[BARTOLOMEO] Plus there's a ship
waiting at the eastern port!

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.667
[FRANKY]
Man, you're a lifesaver!

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.436
We let Nami's group
take the Sunny,

00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:50.508
so we were in kind of a bind!

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.945
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
Anything for youse guys!

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.423
[BARTOLOMEO] We all fought
together as a team!

00:07:58.524 --> 00:07:59.792
You think we'd just roll over

00:07:59.892 --> 00:08:02.063
and let 'em take
our star player away?

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:09.746
Bellamy. Can you walk?

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:13.319
Yeah. Or run, if I need to.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.123
[LUFFY]
All right! Good to hear!

00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:19.700
[BELLAMY] Trafalgar.
Why didn't you leave me

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.469
to my fate back there?

00:08:22.037 --> 00:08:24.842
Thanks to you,
I lost my place to die!

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:27.247
Straw Hat said that
you were a friend of his,

00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:28.818
so I carried you.

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:30.921
Die here if you want.

00:08:31.022 --> 00:08:32.925
Now that those tiny people
have patched me up,

00:08:33.025 --> 00:08:35.096
it's like I was never injured!

00:08:35.196 --> 00:08:37.234
So what makes you think
I'm gonna be killed off

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:38.937
by a run-in with the damn Navy?

00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:41.610
Then find another way
to die, dumbass.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.179
What'd you say?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.784
That's a pretty stupid way
of saying thank you.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.030
[MARINES yelling]

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.936
They're here! There's no more
time for chit-chat!

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:56.840
Time to start hauling some ass!

00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.579
[BARTOLOMEO]
This way, comrades!

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.050
[MARINE C]
Found 'em!

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:04.789
[MARINE D] Don't let those
pirates get away! Shoot, now!

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.734
[USOPP screaming]

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:13.807
Wait, I've got just
the thing! Barrier!

00:09:16.345 --> 00:09:19.284
[MARINE E]
Don't let up! Fire at will!

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:21.790
[BARTOLOMEO]
Everybody follow me, all right?

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:31.643
We don't wanna get
snapped up by Fujitora!

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:34.749
Stick together no matter what!

00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:59.632
Huh? Mister Luffy!

00:10:09.084 --> 00:10:11.790
You guys can go on ahead.
I got something I need to do!

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.259
[BARTOLOMEO]
What?!

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:14.896
We don't have a lot
of time here, Luffy!

00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:17.200
So whatever it is,
make it quick!

00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:19.104
We'll wait for you there!

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:20.473
'Kay, see ya!

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:21.810
[ZORO]
Let's go!

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.912
[BARTOLOMEO]
Actually, you're running

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:24.549
to the south, Mister Zoro!

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.020
But somehow you
still look awesome!

00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:31.997
There's Straw Hat!

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:34.034
Let's shoot him down!

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:37.842
Now, Gum-Gum Balloon, go!

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:44.822
[grunts]

00:10:45.758 --> 00:10:47.160
[MARINES gasp]

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:54.407
How 'bout Gum-Gum Gatling!

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:06.867
[TANK]
You called?

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.604
[DOLDO]
Tank. Good.

00:11:08.704 --> 00:11:12.310
I need you to summon Viola
and Rebecca for me, please.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.547
[TANK]
Yes, sir.

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:15.684
We'll address the town

00:11:15.784 --> 00:11:20.026
and declare that my family and I
will be returning to the throne,

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.830
if that's what they want.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.399
Gladly, sir!

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.938
I've been looking forward
to this day for so long!

00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:33.854
[DOLDO] Now we can start
again from the beginning.

00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:35.389
[REBECCA]
What? Lucy?

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:44.374
[VIOLET]
Yes, they're about to set sail

00:11:44.474 --> 00:11:45.878
to escape from the Navy.

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:48.215
Oh no! They can't!

00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:50.219
I haven't had a chance
to say thank you!

00:11:56.833 --> 00:12:00.439
[FUJITORA] Could today be the
day his luck finally runs out?

00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:04.348
[yells]

00:12:04.448 --> 00:12:09.057
[FUJITORA] Fate's protected him
from my hand until now!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.436
[BASTILLE] From this point on,
instead of Issho,

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:17.842
I'm commanding all units!

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:19.579
And I want you to
keep tracking down

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:22.519
the criminals who were hidden
inside the Palace, got it?

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:23.921
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:25.323
What about Straw Hat's
group who were

00:12:25.423 --> 00:12:27.695
seen running from
the hill in Carta?

00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:30.466
[BARTOLOMEO]
Just follow the flag, everybody!

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.443
[USOPP gasps]

00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:37.849
Are you okay,
Mister Sniper King?

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:40.721
You're even cool
when you fall down!

00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:44.127
[USOPP gasping]
Are you sure it's safe to run

00:12:44.228 --> 00:12:46.465
straight through the town
with Marines everywhere?

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:47.869
Would I lie to you?

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:50.039
Just keep running
and trust me, sir!

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:52.612
[MARINE H] We're pursuing
the pirates as we speak!

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:55.517
It looks like they're making
their way to the eastern port!

00:12:55.617 --> 00:12:59.057
[BASTILLE] Roger that.
Get that port on the line, now!

00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:01.563
[JEET] Yes, hello, you've
reached the Navy lookout unit

00:13:01.663 --> 00:13:03.967
currently stationed at
the eastern port, over!

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.304
[MARINES groan]

00:13:06.404 --> 00:13:09.211
[ABDULLAH]
Everything's good here! Over!

00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:11.082
[MARINES groan]

00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:13.152
"Everything is good"?

00:13:13.253 --> 00:13:15.758
Would it kill you to
take this more seriously?

00:13:15.858 --> 00:13:19.097
The pirates are headed
straight toward you right now!

00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:22.905
[JEET] I don't think so.
It's all quiet on our end!

00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:26.178
Don't bother
sending backup. Over!

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:27.480
Over!

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:29.418
[IDEO chuckles]

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.088
[BASTILLE]
Oh yeah?

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:33.660
Give me your name
and your Marine code!

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.068
[JEET]
My what? Uh, let's see.

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:40.340
[BASTILLE]
Damn it all!

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.879
They've taken control
of the eastern port!

00:13:42.979 --> 00:13:45.116
Send in some reinforcements!

00:13:45.216 --> 00:13:46.151
[MARINE I]
Sir!

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.557
[MARINES groan]

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:51.963
Head straight to the port!
We can cover for you!

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:53.499
Thank you!

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.102
[MARINES groan]

00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:58.544
Don't waste our time
on that thank you crap!

00:13:58.644 --> 00:14:00.580
[MARINES groan]

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.352
We owe you guys.

00:14:03.452 --> 00:14:06.224
We'll be paying you back
for a long time!

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:08.863
[USOPP]
Really, a roadblock?

00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:12.604
[ALL]
Huh?

00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:18.115
[MARINES gasp]

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:20.654
--All clear.
--Wow, you're the best!

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:26.465
[MARINES groaning]

00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:33.847
We've located the
criminals who were

00:14:33.947 --> 00:14:35.584
supposed to be at
the Royal Palace,

00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:37.722
but for some reason, they're all
in the middle of town, sir!

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:39.424
[BASTILLE]
What?

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:41.629
Wait a second, are you telling
me that the Palace is empty?

00:14:46.172 --> 00:14:47.340
[MARINE K]
No way!

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:52.450
Ugh. Come on! Seriously?

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:55.323
[gasps]

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:58.530
[LUFFY]
Ah crap, my arm got stuck!

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.431
There he goes!

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:00.801
What's he doing?

00:15:00.901 --> 00:15:02.504
[MARINES scream]

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:06.913
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:07.013 --> 00:15:11.254
[LUFFY]
Aw man, I'm getting dizzy.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.962
[MARINES gasp]

00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:41.381
[MARINES scream]

00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:43.019
[MARINE N]
We're in front of the Palace!

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.123
[MARINES groan]

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:48.062
Um. Straw Hat's here!

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:50.801
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum....

00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:51.903
[gasps]

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:55.442
[LUFFY]
...Fireworks!

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:58.449
[MARINES groan]

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.758
[yells]

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:13.312
Rebecca! Hey!
Tell me where you are!

00:16:16.418 --> 00:16:17.821
[BASTILLE]
What is Straw Hat doing

00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:19.993
in front of the Royal Palace?

00:16:20.093 --> 00:16:23.032
[groans] Do not
let him get away!

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:23.666
[MARINE N]
Right!

00:16:30.313 --> 00:16:32.383
I know what'll knock
these guys out.

00:16:32.483 --> 00:16:36.358
Gum-Gum Giant Pistol, go!

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:37.728
[thud]

00:16:37.828 --> 00:16:39.933
My! What's that?

00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:42.705
[LUFFY]
Rebecca!

00:16:42.805 --> 00:16:44.007
[REBECCA gasps]

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:48.516
[LUFFY]
Hey! Rebecca!

00:16:50.053 --> 00:16:52.089
Somebody's calling
for me, but why?

00:16:55.062 --> 00:16:57.802
[REBECCA]
Lucy? Lucy!

00:16:57.902 --> 00:17:01.809
I'm up here! Lucy!

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:02.845
[LUFFY gasps]

00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:05.283
No! Don't speak to him, milady!

00:17:05.383 --> 00:17:07.521
He's a filthy pirate!

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:09.190
There you are!

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:13.098
[SERVANT C gasps]

00:17:13.934 --> 00:17:16.539
[LUFFY]
Rebecca!

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:18.776
Lucy! I'm here!

00:17:20.246 --> 00:17:21.749
[REBECCA]
Thank goodness!

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.653
[GUARD A]
Straw Hat! What do you want?

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:30.399
[panting]

00:17:34.074 --> 00:17:35.644
I'm so glad.

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:37.314
[GUARD A] Please get back,
Lady Rebecca!

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:38.415
[REBECCA]
Huh?

00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:40.587
Straw Hat?

00:17:40.687 --> 00:17:43.125
What a relief!
You're still here!

00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:45.664
Listen. I wanted to
say thank you for--

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:50.406
Shut up! That's not
the reason why I came!

00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:52.678
Are you okay with all of this?

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:53.580
[REBECCA]
Huh?

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:54.648
[LUFFY]
Soldier, I mean!

00:17:54.748 --> 00:17:55.750
[gasps]

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.688
He's gonna leave forever!

00:18:00.794 --> 00:18:04.300
[REBECCA] Well, the thing is,
he sent me a letter.

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:11.615
[REBECCA] It sounds like
he's trying to put

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:14.354
as much distance between
him and me as possible.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.403
[REBECCA] He wants us to be
strangers from now on.

00:18:24.608 --> 00:18:26.011
[REBECCA]
Oh, shut up!

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:28.448
Stop acting like
you're my father!

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:32.356
[REBECCA]
It must be because of

00:18:32.456 --> 00:18:34.127
the terrible things
I said to him.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.137
[REBECCA]
You can't beat Doflamingo!

00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:40.574
Look at yourself!

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:43.513
You're just a broken
toy with one leg!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.367
[REBECCA]
Do you think he doesn't

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.204
want us to live together?

00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:03.219
Maybe I'm just a nuisance!

00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:05.557
Beats me! Not my call!

00:19:05.657 --> 00:19:08.764
I just came to ask if you're
fine with him leaving!

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.299
So tell me!

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.504
'Cause I gotta get out
of this kingdom, too!

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.878
Of course not!

00:19:15.978 --> 00:19:18.717
It's not okay at all!

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.687
Then come with me.

00:19:21.923 --> 00:19:22.691
Let's go.

00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:25.195
[GUARD A]
Huh?

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:26.331
[GUARD B]
Lady Rebecca!

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.503
Hold on! Straw Hat! Rebecca!

00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:30.774
[REBECCA gasps]
Viola!

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:32.911
I need a favor from you!

00:19:35.182 --> 00:19:36.251
[LUFFY]
Taking off!

00:19:37.219 --> 00:19:38.656
[MARINES gasp]

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.069
'Kay! Don't let go!

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:46.404
I'm trying!

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:48.810
[MARINE P]
There he is!

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.081
[SERVANT A]
What should we do?

00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:52.851
[ROYAL A]
I'll go tell King Riku!

00:20:00.534 --> 00:20:02.303
[ROYAL A]
Your Majesty!

00:20:02.403 --> 00:20:04.074
What's the matter?

00:20:04.174 --> 00:20:08.282
It's terrible. Lady Rebecca's
been carried away by a pirate!

00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:10.920
[DOLDO]
A pirate? What was his name?

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.225
Where did he come from?
Tell me everything!

00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:15.997
Was he a warrior
from the coliseum?

00:20:16.097 --> 00:20:19.070
Um. It... It was...

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.074
It was Straw Hat Luffy, sir!

00:20:21.174 --> 00:20:23.012
[gasps]

00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:26.820
A man just came to the Palace
and kidnapped Lady Rebecca!

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.558
I'm pretty sure it was
Straw Hat Luffy. Right?

00:20:29.659 --> 00:20:31.061
[TOWNSMAN D]
I think so!

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.332
He's probably taking her
for ransom, isn't he?

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:35.069
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.607
But that can't be! Lucy?

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:40.446
It doesn't sound
like him at all!

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:42.685
I'm sure there's a reason!

00:20:42.785 --> 00:20:47.828
Hey, Lucy! I still love you!

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:49.698
[TOWNSMAN F]
Gyats, what are you saying?

00:20:49.798 --> 00:20:51.869
You see? This is
what happens when you

00:20:51.969 --> 00:20:54.173
trust pirates to do
as they please!

00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:55.744
Now go capture Straw Hat

00:20:55.844 --> 00:20:58.850
and return the princess
to the Palace safely!

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.305
[MARINE Q]
Up there!

00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:13.044
Special Sniper Unit,
take your shot, quickly!

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.117
Huh?

00:21:32.217 --> 00:21:34.555
[TOWNSWOMAN A screams]

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:40.633
Oh, no! They collapsed
out of nowhere!

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:44.173
[BASTILLE] It knocked them down?
Conqueror's Haki?

00:21:44.274 --> 00:21:46.812
[MARINE S] No, looks like
they're still conscious.

00:21:46.912 --> 00:21:51.421
Regardless, the pirates
are about to escape!

00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:53.459
I want battleships in place!

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.064
Send all of our forces
east to Carta!

00:21:56.164 --> 00:21:57.534
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:15.837
[BARTOLOMEO] Don't give up now!
We're almost home free!

00:22:22.684 --> 00:22:25.489
Stay with me.
The rescue team's coming soon.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:28.028
Agh. Yes, sir.

00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:30.499
You want some rice crackers?

00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:32.102
[MARINE U]
No, thank you.

00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:34.541
Huh?

00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:37.413
[SENGOKU]
That's him.

00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:43.960
[TOWNSMAN H]
Oh! There he is!

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.996
Hey!

00:22:45.096 --> 00:22:49.437
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.781
[TOWNSMAN I]
We gotta catch Lucy!

00:22:57.621 --> 00:23:00.025
Go on and try!

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.424
[NARRATOR] Kyros wishes
for his daughter's happiness

00:23:16.525 --> 00:23:19.230
as he prepares for
a journey of no return.

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.001
Meanwhile, with Luffy's help,

00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:23.607
Rebecca evades her pursuers
and rushes to see her father!

00:23:23.707 --> 00:23:25.342
Torn between her
role as a princess

00:23:25.442 --> 00:23:26.812
and the daughter of a warrior,

00:23:26.912 --> 00:23:29.552
Rebecca must find a path
forward for her family.

00:23:29.652 --> 00:23:31.388
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.488 --> 00:23:33.458
"The Bond Between
Father and Daughter!

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:34.995
Kyros and Rebecca!"

00:23:35.095 --> 00:23:38.034
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
