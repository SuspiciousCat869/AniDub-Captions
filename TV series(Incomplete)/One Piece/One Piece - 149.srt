00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,821
Lousy!

179
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,949
[BELLAMY]
Sarquiss, no!

180
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,701
I'm going to finish him
off my way!

181
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,829
It's him again.

182
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:02,208
The one with those
Spring‐Spring fruit powers.

183
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,001
Shojo, run,
get out of there now!

184
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
[BELLAMY]
Spring...

185
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,381
[wails]

186
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,425
[BELLAMY]
...Sniper!

187
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,053
No! Shojo!

188
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,238
[SHOJO]
Old‐timer! Look what we found!

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,407
Gold! A bell‐shaped ingot!

190
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,868
[laughs]

191
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,796
[MASIRA] Look! It's just like
it says here in the logbook!

192
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,797
Gold bells!

193
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,799
The story's true!

194
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,762
[BELLAMY]
We're done here.

195
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,221
Load up!

196
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,265
Let's go!

197
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,475
And as for you,
old man, grow up!

198
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,393
[laughs]

199
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,895
This "City of Gold"
is just a fairytale!

200
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,231
That liar, Noland,
dreamt it all up!

201
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,775
If you want to be
a pirate in this new era,

202
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,235
you've got to wise up.

203
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,988
Your dreams will
never come true! Ever!

204
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,283
[laughter]

205
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,911
[MASIRA] The City of Gold
does exist! Hehe!

206
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,248
[CRICKET laughs]
Hey, guys! Take it easy!

207
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,752
My house is pretty small!

208
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,004
Ya know something, junior?

209
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,092
[coughs]

210
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,435
A worthless little punk like you
who is too afraid to believe

211
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:50,191
in dreams doesn't have the
right to call himself a pirate.

212
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,027
What was that?

213
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,095
[ZORO] It's like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

214
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,304
We didn't even see one.

215
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,181
[LUFFY] Well, we did, but we
could never get close enough

216
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,685
to grab it thanks
to all those stupid bugs.

217
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,728
All we did was run.

218
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,231
So seven people
couldn't catch one bird?

219
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,107
That's pathetic!

220
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,025
C'mon would you
get it together, guys!

221
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,402
You're one to talk.

222
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,445
[sighs]
We've been doing this for hours!

223
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't think I can run anymore!

224
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,118
Duuuuu!

225
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,247
Du du du du du! Duu duu!

226
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,916
He just said, "You
morons think you can catch us?

227
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,501
Hah! Good one!"

228
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,961
Morons? What nerve!

229
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,462
Hey, birdbrain,
I'll give you a "good one,"

230
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,715
right between your eyes!

231
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,051
Duu! Duu!

232
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,849
[ROBIN]
I can grab it if I can see it.

233
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,435
Duuuuu!

234
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:10,730
[LUFFY]
Hey, Pops!

235
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,858
We caught one of those birds!

236
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,359
Pops! What happened?

237
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,069
[USOPP]
Masira!

238
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,321
[SANJI]
Shojo!

239
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,114
[NAMI]
What the‐‐?

240
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,074
What happened here?

241
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,076
[SANJI]
I've got a better question.

242
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,494
Who did this?

243
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,830
Hey, gimme a hand!

244
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,290
[USOPP]
Aahh! The Going Merry!

245
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,916
What happened to her?

246
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,792
Who did this?

247
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,294
When I find out,
they're gonna be sorry

248
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,796
they ever laid a finger
on her, the savages!

249
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,047
Dammit!

250
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:37,923
[CRICKET]
Sorry, kid.

251
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,092
You're alive!

252
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,510
‐‐Don't try to move, okay?
‐‐I'm really sorry about this.

253
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,262
‐‐Just take it easy!
‐‐I'm really sorry about this.

254
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,432
We did everything we could to
stop them, but it wasn't enough.

255
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,976
They made us
look pretty pathetic.

256
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,978
We gotta get movin' though.

257
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,314
Your ship's not
gonna patch itself up.

258
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,108
Hold on, Pops. Wait!
Tell us what happened first!

259
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,777
Who did this to you?

260
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,527
Calm down.

261
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,361
It's okay.

262
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,488
Don't worry about it.

263
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,448
It doesn't matter anymore.

264
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,950
Did you have any
luck finding a‐‐

265
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,077
Duuu.

266
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,497
Look at that,
you got yourself a South Bird.

267
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,290
Nice job.

268
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,793
They're hard to catch.

269
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,335
[NAMI]
Luffy!

270
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,044
Huh?

271
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,047
Cricket's gold! It's all gone!

272
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,136
That stuff?

273
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:24,845
It's junk.

274
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,971
Just forget it.

275
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,097
It doesn't matter.

276
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,933
Your dream is more important.

277
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,476
We have to get
you to the Knock‐‐

278
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,311
Forget it?
How can you say that?

279
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,021
Think about what it
took to get that gold!

280
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,940
Ten years of diving to
the bottom of the ocean!

281
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,400
Subjecting your body to all
the pressures of the deep!

282
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,401
Come on, you can't just‐‐

283
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,111
Shut up!

284
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,032
I'm serious.

285
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,118
That gold, and what
happens to it, is our problem.

286
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,079
Got it?

287
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,082
Your ship's in no shape to
make it to the Knock‐Up Stream.

288
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,292
If we can get all the
Saruyama Alliance crew here,

289
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,088
they'll have it fixed
and reinforced by morning.

290
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,508
You'll still be able
to set sail tomorrow.

291
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,175
Listen.

292
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,010
Everything will be all right.

293
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,847
We will send you to the sky,
I promise that.

294
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,474
Old‐timer.

295
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,852
Hey, Luffy.

296
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,360
That's Bellamy's mark!

297
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,864
You want any help?

298
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,282
I'll handle this one alone.

299
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,533
[NAMI]
Luffy, don't be stupid!

300
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,034
We don't have time for this!

301
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,871
We have to set
sail in three hours!

302
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,292
[LUFFY]
If I follow the coast,

303
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,961
will that take me all the
way back to Mock Town?

304
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,588
Yes, I believe it will.

305
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:46,093
Hey, where are you goin'?

306
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,344
Don't be an idiot!

307
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,931
You can't possibly take on this
Bellamy guy all by yourself!

308
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,142
If you wanna stop him, use this.

309
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,520
Kid. Don't do it.

310
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,068
I'll be back by morning, guys.

311
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,403
[DRUNKARD taking a leak]

312
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,654
Well, lookee there!

313
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,575
Wow! Looks like the ole moon's
right out there under the water!

314
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,411
Guess my eyesight's
really gettin' bad!

315
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,913
I better get my eyes checked

316
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,124
or I'm gonna end up
fallin' off this dock!

317
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,500
Hahah!

318
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,168
Imagine that!

319
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,462
A pirate with bad eyesight!

320
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,588
Me?

321
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,466
I think I'd rather lose one eye
than have two bad ones!

322
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,550
Hahah.

323
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,011
'Least I'd get an eyepatch!

324
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,220
[laughs]

325
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,181
A fancy one, too!

326
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,057
Hey!

327
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,224
Whadda ya know!

328
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,059
A newspaper!

329
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,229
It must be the
really early edition!

330
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,981
Huh? This ain't no paper!

331
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,275
It's a stack of wanted posters!

332
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,443
Oh, boy.

333
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
What is this town comin'
to when low‐life scum outnumber

334
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,157
the fine, upstanding
citizens like myself?

335
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,200
Huh?

336
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,328
It's those spineless guys
from this afternoon!

337
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,245
Hah!

338
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,122
That looney kid talkin'
about the island

339
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,124
in the sky was a riot!

340
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,209
What was he worth?

341
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,252
Thirty million?

342
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,128
Hmm?

343
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,171
[laughs]

344
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,383
I guess my eyesight really
is gettin' pretty bad!

345
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,428
So one, ten, one hundred,
one thousand,

346
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,683
ten thousand,
one hundred thousand?

347
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,020
I think I'm gonna need
some reading glasses!

348
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,481
One hundred thousand.

349
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,484
O‐One million.

350
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:30,656
One hundred million?

351
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,078
[NAMI]
Three hours, Luffy!

352
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,999
That's all you've got!

353
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,001
If you take any longer...

354
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,798
[NAMI] ...we're going to lose
our chance to go to sky island,

355
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,551
and it's going to

all down their faces,

like these losers who fake

to make a name for themselves!

some pretty big capers.
