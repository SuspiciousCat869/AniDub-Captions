1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,191
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,693
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:45,365
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,370
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,740
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,310
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,546
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,216
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,152
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,422
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,627
[USOPP] I've got you.
I'm on to your tricks.

48
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:15,461
Wait! Stop!

49
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,230
What do you
think you're aiming at?

50
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,567
[USOPP]
That.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,235
No, hang on!

52
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,070
Special Attack: Atlas Comet!

53
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,811
[chuckles menacingly]

54
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,640
Just as I expected.

55
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,611
There it is.

56
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,113
I've found your
real body, Ghost Girl!

57
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,224
[LUFFY]
"Perona is Terrified!

58
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,127
Usopp and Untruthful
Share the Same 'U.'"

59
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,346
I can see you plain
as day but you can fly,

60
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,548
you can walk straight
through walls and people,

61
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,652
and to top it off, you
can change your size at will.

62
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,153
I'm no paranormal expert,

63
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,489
but it sure sounds
like you're a ghost to me.

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,759
[USOPP]
So, the question is,

65
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,828
why would a ghost
run away from me like you did?

66
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,565
[PERONA]
Leave me alone!

67
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,335
[USOPP]
Quit running away from me!

68
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,503
Give it up, ghost girl!

69
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,838
Go away!

70
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,040
The only thing
that makes sense

71
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:10,510
is that you had a physical
body when I was chasing you.

72
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,253
What's your point?

73
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,287
My point!

74
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:21,721
[squeaks]

75
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,356
Is you're a ghost duplicate.

76
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,758
You slipped out of your
body and became a ghost

77
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,360
as soon as I
lost sight of you.

78
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,697
[USOPP]
That, right there.

79
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,365
That's your real body!

80
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,200
I'm done fallin'
for your tricks!

81
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,955
And here I thought you were
just some pessimistic idiot.

82
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,258
Did your little superhero
mask make you feel better?

83
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,595
Still, I'm surprised you had
the wits to figure it all out.

84
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,465
But you're only
about 90 percent right.

85
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,467
I'm not just a ghost duplicate

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,736
being controlled
by my real body.

87
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,640
[PERONA] My entire spirit is
able to detach and float free,

88
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,844
a hollow with its own will,
leaving my body empty.

89
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,345
Thanks for explaining.

90
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,981
I'm just curious, what
do you think would happen

91
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,751
if you didn't have
a body to go back to?

92
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,922
[USOPP] 'Cause I've got
a feeling that my attacks

93
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,592
are actually gonna
hit this time around!

94
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,760
You bastard!

95
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,827
Don't you dare!

96
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,862
I'll blow you to bits!

97
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,930
Here comes my Big Bang Star!

98
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,470
[PERONA]
That was way too close.

99
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,705
But you missed!

100
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,807
And it looks like
it was a dud anyway.

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,675
This one won't be!

102
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,611
Like I'm giving
you another shot!

103
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,646
Special Hollow!

104
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:54,947
Gahh!

105
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,350
That one isn't
gonna blow up, is it?

106
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,384
Mini Hollow.

107
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,855
[PERONA]
Rap! Rap!

108
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,794
A giant version
of the ones from before!

109
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,295
[screams]

110
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,898
[USOPP]
Oh, this is messed up!

111
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,966
Get this thing
off me, dammit!

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,034
You just stay put.

113
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,837
I'm not letting you lay
a finger on my real body.

114
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,473
Hey, c'mon, wait,
can't we talk about this?

115
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,708
Those little ones
hurt enough already!

116
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,677
Can't ya just
use those on me again?

117
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,647
This big one
will blow me to pieces!

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,016
You can struggle
all you want, it won't help.

119
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,818
You're inside a ghost.

120
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,820
Horo horo horo!

121
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,863
[giggles]

122
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,326
Gum-Gum...

123
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,062
...Bazooka!

124
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,096
Augh!

125
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,800
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Whip!

126
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,349
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

127
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,583
Is something wrong?

128
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:42,121
Didn't you have some plan to
kick my ass over and over again?

129
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,189
Yeah!

130
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,125
Don't get impatient on me,
I'll get around to it!

131
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,193
[MORIA]
Of course, that's fine.

132
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,928
I'm not trying
to rush you.

133
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,663
I'm just worried
that he'll come back

134
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,265
before you get a chance to.

135
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,799
What's that mean?

136
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,368
Who the hell're
you talking about?

137
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,837
Kushishishi!

138
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,605
Why you, of course!

139
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,343
[OARS]
Dammit.

140
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,047
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

141
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,288
Hmm.

142
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,032
It's not here?

143
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:31,737
Ah!

144
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,140
Hahahaha!

145
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,175
I found it.

146
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,415
I don't feel like
me without my hat on.

147
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,017
I'm gonna be

148
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,888
King of the Pirates!

149
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:50,923
Oh, yeah.

150
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,926
I'll fire a salute
to let everyone know.

151
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,898
Oh, crap,
that'd be awesome!

152
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,935
Anybody know
where the cannon is?

153
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,074
Cannon!

154
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,346
Ocho Fleurs.

155
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,118
[choked screaming]

156
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,392
[ROBIN thinking] He's much
stronger than he looks.

157
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,399
Fasfasfasfas!

158
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,801
Look at them
trying to fight back.

159
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,237
This would go a lot
faster if you just gave up.

160
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,906
Fasfasfasfas!

161
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,111
[CHOPPER]
Robin.

162
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:19,845
[DOGGUIN]
Hey!

163
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,748
What're ya just
standin' there for?

164
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,184
This ain't the time
to try to look cool.

165
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,452
Ya crappy
little reindeer.

166
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,421
Sanji.

167
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,955
Say wha'?

168
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,957
You're speakin'
gibberish, moron.

169
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,093
Not that I'm gonna give
you the chance to explain.

170
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,444
Ya can't beat me
but ya could at least try,

171
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,112
ya worthless pile of crap.

172
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,114
[JIGORO]
36 Caliber Phoenix!

173
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,453
[CHOPPER]
Robin!

174
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,223
Hey, dumb ass!

175
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,225
Maybe ya wanna watch
where you're aimin' that crap!

176
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,493
Right back at you!

177
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,563
Now stop running around like a
chicken with its head cut off!

178
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,831
Now's my chance!

179
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,971
Do it now,
Robin, the salt!

180
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,172
Just hold him still!

181
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,260
[DOGGUIN] He's gotta be
the most useless partner ever.

182
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,094
Get back!

183
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,330
You realize
Robin's a lady, right?

184
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,331
[DOGGUIN]
A lady?

185
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,833
[DOGGUIN]
Who gives a crap?

186
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,872
Robin, no!

187
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,342
Wait, how could Sanji...?

188
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,210
That doesn't make any sense.

189
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,455
Keep fightin' if you wanna die.

190
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,303
Fasfasfasfas!

191
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,372
Looks like the battle's ended!

192
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,584
[panicked screaming]

193
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,060
[panicked screaming]

194
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:53,299
Can-non, can-non,
can-non, can-non.

195
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,902
Can-non, can-non, can--

196
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,237
Wait.

197
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,672
What am I lookin' for?

198
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,074
And why am I
all the way out here?

199
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,578
Why's this on my head?

200
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,646
Maybe that dumb
thing shook up my brain

201
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,349
and made me forget
what I'm supposed to do.

202
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,118
Uh... I kinda
remember somethin' about

203
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,322
bein' a pirate,
but that can't be right.

204
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,923
Why would I waste my time

205
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,459
on something stupid
like being a pirate king?

206
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:38,677
Kushishishishi!

207
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,635
I remember.

208
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,472
This isn't the time to
fool around out in the jungle.

209
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,374
I gotta go.

210
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,976
I gotta get back there fast.

211
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,755
Gotta get back.

212
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:28,160
Gotta get back to
master Moria, cuz he needs me.

213
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,887
[giggles]

214
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,121
[USOPP]
Let me go,

215
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,290
let me out of this damn thing!

216
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:58,791
Help!

217
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,960
Horo horo horo!

218
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,562
Too bad you mucked
up that shot, long-nose.

219
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,531
With a simple
snap of my fingers,

220
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,967
you'll be reduced to
a puddle of guts and goo.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,302
[USOPP]
No, please don't! Please!

222
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,571
I'd make a terrible puddle!

223
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,639
[PERONA]
Horo horo horo!

224
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,808
Oh, don't you worry.

225
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,476
You won't stay
that way for long.

226
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,478
Hogback will use
whatever's left of you

227
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,013
to make a long-nosed zombie.

228
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,048
Kamikaze Rap!

229
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:27,486
No!

230
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,721
It vanished!

231
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,857
[USOPP]
That was too close.

232
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,060
I used this impact dial
to absorb the explosion.

233
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,695
What do you--

234
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,066
Huh?
What the hell is this stuff?

235
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,401
It's a bluff!

236
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,335
[PERONA]
What do you mean?

237
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,371
You see, that shot
I took at you earlier

238
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,740
landed exactly
where I wanted it to.

239
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,108
And it wasn't a dud, either.

240
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,844
It was actually
a Sticky Star bullet.

241
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,379
[USOPP] I made sure
you couldn't move

242
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,414
after you returned
to your real body.

243
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,682
[PERONA]
You did what?

244
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,384
Now that your
ghost and body are one,

245
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,085
I can kill
two birds with one shot.

246
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,520
[PERONA]
Dammit.

247
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,595
You're the one who purified

248
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,764
our Captain Kumacy, aren't you?

249
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,532
What perfect timing!

250
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,035
Now take the creep out,
Lieutenant Hippo Gentleman!

251
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,137
[growling]

252
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,471
[USOPP]
Impact!

253
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:30,749
[PERONA thinking]
Wait.

254
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,785
Is he actually strong after all?

255
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,055
[USOPP thinking]
So much pain!

256
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,458
I feel like
my arm's gonna snap in two!

257
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,661
[PERONA]
Lieutenant Hippo!

258
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,009
You should
really be more worried

259
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,977
about yourself right now.

260
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,085
[USOPP]
Special Attack.

261
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,121
Shiny Black Star!

262
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,659
[wailing]

263
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,698
[chittering]

264
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,046
[PERONA screaming]

265
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,781
[PERONA]
Cockroaches!

266
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,649
[USOPP]
Also known as the Roach Star.

267
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,152
So disgusting!

268
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,788
Get them off of me!

269
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,622
[PERONA]
Help me!

270
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:46,625
I can't get away!

271
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,796
They're getting in my clothes!

272
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,030
Please! I hate cockroaches!

273
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,165
Please, somebody!

274
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,633
Kumacy!

275
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,574
[laughing menacingly]

276
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,548
[USOPP] I had a feeling
cockroaches would freak you out.

277
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,416
But if you wanna know

278
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,585
what you should
be really scared of,

279
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
you're lookin' at him.

280
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,591
[USOPP] You shouldn't have
underestimated me, Princess.

281
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,261
I was known through the
entire stretch of East Blue

282
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,063
as the strongest
man who ever lived.

283
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,698
[PERONA]
Ten tons?

284
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,100
How can you even
fit that much strength

285
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,835
in that scrawny body of yours?

286
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,903
I don't even have a chance!

287
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,671
I can't move!

288
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,007
[PERONA]
Please! Please stop!

289
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,700
[PERONA] Please don't, I'll
die if you hit me with that!

290
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,036
And get these
disgusting roaches off of me!

291
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,304
Not the hammer, please!

292
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,772
And not the cockroaches, either!

293
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,640
Please! Please!

294
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,551
Usaw-wo-wo-po!

295
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,720
[PERONA]
Please spare my life!

296
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,822
I'm sorry,
I'm begging you, please!

297
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,757
I swear I won't
lay a finger on your crew

298
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,458
if you let me live!

299
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,126
Please don't kill me, please!

300
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,961
[USOPP]
Stop crying!

301
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,662
It's too late!

302
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,765
[PERONA]
No!

303
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,734
Golden Pound!

304
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,638
[screaming]

305
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,777
[USOPP] That is
one sad Ghost Princess.

306
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,715
Though she should
be ashamed of herself,

307
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,351
passing out at the sight of
some toy roaches and a balloon.

308
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,690
[USOPP]
Whew.

309
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,692
Talk about a stupid move.

310
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,360
Nobody challenges Usopp in the

311
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,896
art of negativity
and lying and wins!

312
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,303
You just stay
put until sunrise.

313
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,372
Ahahahaha!

314
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,410
[USOPP] This is turning out to
be a pretty good day after all.

315
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,744
I won!

316
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,680
Yahahaha!

317
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:07,059
[clashing swords]

318
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,417
[FRANKY]
Ya hear that?

319
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,721
It sounded like the
samurai said something.

320
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,190
I couldn't understand him.

321
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,292
A better question.

322
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,794
What in the hell's
goin' on here?

323
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,529
What's going on?

324
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,467
In short, it looks like the
battle between them's over.

325
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,302
I've seen many
fights in my life,

326
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,370
but I assure you none of them

327
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,205
have been anything like this.

328
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,906
[BROOK]
That samurai.

329
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,043
He scarcely used
a fraction of his strength

330
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,444
when he was fighting me!

331
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,967
[RYUMA] So you intend to
take my blade from me, do you?

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,769
Well, you're quite ambitious!

333
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,237
Two Sword or Three Sword style,

334
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,806
I couldn't care less
how many swords you use.

335
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,307
Nyohohohoho!

336
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,143
I'm looking forward to this!

337
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,112
I haven't had a
good dance in a while!

338
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,480
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

339
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,983
"Slashes Dancing on the Rooftop!

340
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,452
Showdown, Zoro versus Ryuma."

341
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,155
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
