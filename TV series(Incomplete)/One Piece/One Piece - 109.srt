00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,530
[LUFFY] Nonsense?
Vivi doesn't see it that way.

180
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,864
Ya see, unlike most people,

181
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,601
she genuinely cares
about others.

182
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,635
[CROCODILE]
Huh.

183
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,804
[LUFFY] I guess, deep down,
she's an optimist,

184
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,006
even if it's not too realistic.

185
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,541
Take this revolt, for example.

186
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,810
She believes no
one needs to die.

187
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,945
Nobody needs to die?

188
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,549
The problem with idealistic
fools like Princess Vivi

189
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,818
is they take a stand without
any comprehension

190
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,120
of what is truly involved
in a real fight.

191
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,855
Wouldn't you agree?

192
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,056
Yep.

193
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,965
[LUFFY]
But that doesn't change the fact

194
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,667
that as long as you're around,

195
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,738
Vivi's gonna fight until she
either wins or dies trying.

196
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,240
So, I figure...

197
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,242
...I'll take you down,
right here!

198
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,812
[laughs]

199
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,848
Such a foolish boy.

200
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,816
Despite what the
idealists cry about,

201
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,085
there's one constant truth.

202
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,156
On the rough battlefields of
life, you either kill or die.

203
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,258
That's why I'm more than
happy to shoot a bullet

204
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,894
through every bleeding
heart I meet.

205
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:07,033
Yeah. Which proves you're
the bigger fool here.

206
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,934
[growling]

207
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,570
[chuckles]

208
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,706
You think something's funny?

209
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:17,543
Perhaps you'd like to die
as well, Nico Robin.

210
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,945
If you wanna try,
go right ahead.

211
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,015
And didn't you promise not
to call me by that name?

212
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,717
[CROCODILE]
Where are you going?

213
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,953
[MISS ALL SUNDAY] I'm headed
to Alubarna. See ya there.

214
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,023
Damn woman. I'll
never figure her out.

215
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,095
I've got three minutes to spare.

216
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,800
[CROCODILE]
After that,

217
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,969
I'm certain your time
will've run out as well.

218
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,949
[CROCODILE] Your three
minutes are counting down.

219
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,853
I don't have any more time to
waste on the likes of you.

220
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,094
It's your move kid.

221
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,930
[LUFFY]
With pleasure.

222
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,100
Gum‐Gum...

223
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,935
...Pistol!

224
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,873
[growls]

225
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,884
And Gum‐Gum...

226
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,318
...Stamp!

227
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,055
[growls]

228
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,899
By now it should be quite
obvious, but I'll warn you.

229
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,168
You cannot defeat me.

230
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,837
This is an exercise in futility.

231
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,408
Gum‐Gum... Gatling!

232
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,244
[LUFFY yelling]

233
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,688
[chuckles]

234
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,693
Listen to my warning
and take heed.

235
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,029
If you continue this
senseless attack,

236
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,097
you will have
accomplished nothing.

237
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,033
And wasted what little
time you have left!

238
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,202
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

239
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,838
...Bazooka!

240
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,279
[LUFFY yells]

241
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:21,861
Good riddance! You lousy
old sand gator!

242
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,265
Your wasting your time, boy.

243
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,967
[LUFFY growls]

244
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,201
You bastard!

245
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,770
No matter how hard you
fight against the truth,

246
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,472
there's no way a
rubber freak like you

247
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,407
could even hope to rival me.

248
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,076
[growls]

249
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,944
[CROCODILE]
You'll‐‐

250
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm sorry. My fist
interrupted you!

251
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,481
Now what was that?

252
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,484
[growling]

253
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:56,262
[CROCODILE] I've had my fill
of your pathetic fun and games.

254
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,796
Let's end this. Now.

255
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,597
Fun and games?

256
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,467
Trust me, I'm dead
serious! Jerk!

257
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,068
Damn it, he's right though.

258
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,471
He's got an answer for
all of my attacks.

259
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,273
What do I do now?

260
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,974
We may both be pirates,

261
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,278
but you fall grossly
short on skill.

262
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,480
Desert Spada!

263
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,860
[CROCODILE]
Nice reflexes, boy.

264
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,196
A full‐on hit from that
attack would've killed you.

265
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,834
What the‐‐?!
That's one deep hole!

266
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,803
You may have Devil Fruit powers,

267
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,039
but you lack discipline
and training.

268
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,008
With that, your skills could
be as formidable as any.

269
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,376
But you're not there yet.

270
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,344
Like so many fools,

271
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,213
you waste time obsessing
over your abilities.

272
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,316
Gimmicks get you only
so far in a fight

273
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,952
without the skills‐set
to back them up.

274
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,390
Desert Girasole!

275
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,230
[LUFFY screams]

276
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,839
What in the‐‐? What's going on?

277
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,843
[LUFFY yelling]

278
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:23,082
The sand... It's
sinking! What is this?!

279
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,018
[LUFFY grunting]

280
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,019
What is this stuff?!

281
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,488
Let me out, let me out,
let me out, let me out!

282
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,257
[CROCODILE] What's wrong?
Never heard of quicksand?

283
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,860
It makes for a convenient
desert burial

284
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,329
when you need to get rid
of someone in a hurry.

285
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,399
The sand is drawn down into
underground waterways.

286
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,601
And I have the good fortune
of being able to detect

287
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,370
exactly where they are.

288
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,339
That advantage alone is enough
to make me unbeatable

289
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,441
when fighting in the desert.

290
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,280
[LUFFY] If you think I'm gonna
let myself be buried alive

291
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,284
in this sand trap, you
got another thing comin'!

292
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,286
You bastard!

293
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,555
Gum‐Gum...

294
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,592
...Bazooka!

295
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,294
If I can't slug you,
then maybe...

296
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,630
...I can catch you instead!

297
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,266
Gum‐Gum... Net!

298
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,470
Haven't you learned
anything, moron?

299
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,205
Predictable.

300
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,106
Shut up.

301
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,309
Gum‐Gum... Whip!

302
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,981
This is really getting old.

303
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,815
[LUFFY screams]

304
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,251
[LUFFY]
Let me go! I'm warning you!

305
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,119
[CROCODILE]
Crescent Cutlass!

306
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,293
My‐My arm!

307
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,231
[screams]

308
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,499
[LUFFY]
What did you do?!

309
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,169
It's all shriveled‐up!
Like a mummy!

310
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,470
You turned my arm into a mummy!

311
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,005
[CROCODILE]
Stop whining.

312
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,173
This is the price you pay.

313
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,509
The sand has absorbed all
the moisture from your arm.

314
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,646
You're lucky. All I decided
to attack was your arm.

315
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,417
I can do this all day long,
until you're a pile of dust.

316
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,122
You gotta be kidding me!

317
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,090
[gasps]

318
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,125
[LUFFY]
That's it! Water!

319
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,660
[CROCODILE]
Hm?

320
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:20,599
All in vain.

321
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,601
You're wrong, Sandy!

322
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,371
You see, that old guy in Yuba
gave me this barrel of water.

323
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,607
He spent all night digging
it up just for me!

324
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,543
Luffy, here, take this with you.

325
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,680
He's not scared,
and neither am I.

326
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,451
I'm not about to give into
the sand... without a fight!

327
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,720
Gum‐Gum...

328
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,022
This is getting ridiculous.

329
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,725
[LUFFY]
...Munch‐Munch!

330
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,067
Enough! This ends now!

331
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,570
[LUFFY coughing]

332
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,406
Vermin. It is time to die.

333
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,043
Both you and the
accursed land of Yuba.

334
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:05,911
[LUFFY]
Huh?

335
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,546
[CROCODILE]
Your three minutes are up.

336
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,381
Like I said at the start,

337
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,719
I don't have time to fool
around with you any longer.

338
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,255
Now, Sables!

339
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,168
[LUFFY yells]

340
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,440
Ah, the sand's so
soothing and dry.

341
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,342
[TOWNSFOLK A]
Look out! Sandstorm!

342
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,443
Right ahead! In the sky!

343
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,444
[TOWNSFOLK B]
Take shelter!

344
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,546
[TOWNSFOLK C]
Wait a minute!

345
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,282
No, it's not coming this way!
It's headed south!

346
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,451
Captain Smoker, look! Up there!

347
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,527
[USOPP]
Vivi? What's wrong?

348
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,630
[VIVI] There's a giant storm
moving toward Rainbase!

349
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,034
It's Crocodile.

350
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,438
Luffy, no.

351
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,815
[CROCODILE] Listen carefully.
Can you hear it move?

352
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,417
In this land, the
prevailing winds

353
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,253

354
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,224
And so, if this infantile
sandstorm of mine were, to say,

catch one of these winds,

356
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,561
it would grow exponentially
until it became a monster.

357
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,563
And, following its
trajectory south,

358
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,565
where do you think
it would strike?

Tell me!

you doing this?! Stop it!

to pick up strength.

And eventually, it will
become strong enough
