You can stand down.

178
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,262
[DUCK A, DUCK C squawk]

179
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,666
[SANJI] Now, Vivi, don't you
have a rebellion to stop?

180
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,003
[SANJI]
Go on.

181
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,039
I'll take care of this creep.

182
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,429
[SANJI] So I take it
you're that ridiculous,

183
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,698
face‐changing freak, huh?

184
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,100
You really should
stay out of my way.

185
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,968
But first, just who are you?

186
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,438
[SANJI]
Go on.

00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,140
You guys, watch Karoo.

[DUCK A, DUCK C squawk]

189
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,818
Ah! No! She's getting away!

190
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,453
Oh! You gotta be kidding me!

191
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,987
Gimme a break here!

192
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,890
Well... Now you get to die!

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,826
I think I'll get started
by having you return

194
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,794
our sharpshooter's
prized goggles.

195
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,232
[SANJI]
And that's just the beginning.

196
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,433
[MR. 2]
Huh?

197
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,136
Hope you didn't think
I would be as easy

198
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,571
to beat as him.

199
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
You're with the straw hats, huh?

200
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,909
Well, then, that must make
you the mysterious prince.

201
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,615
My name is Sanji,
and I'm the best cook

202
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,083
in the entire ocean.

203
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,488
Cook? I happen to be
a super first‐class

204
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,956
top‐rate cook as well.

205
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,092
But I use my skills to support
an underworld organization,

206
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,927
not some useless kingdom.

207
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,163
[SANJI] You're not the only one
who knows the underworld.

208
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,966
I happen to be
a cook and a pirate.

209

[MR. 2]
Hmm.

210
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,603
Well then, this should
be quite interesting.

211
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,973
I'll make this clear.

212
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,875
Keep your hands
off this country.

213
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,052
[NAMI]
Go get 'em, Zoro!

214
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,121
What are you waiting for?
Punch 'em out!

215

Knock them on the floor!
You can do it!

216
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:13,793

Go hide somewhere!

217

All right, you guys.

Do you think you could
make this a little challenging?

[NAMI] Come on, Zoro!
This is why we keep you around!

220

It's the only thing
you can do well, right?

Hurry up and finish
off those ugly‐looking,

222
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,151
really bad, evil people...?

223
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,655
What do you think you're doing?
Hold up.

224
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,757
The primary rule
to assassination

225
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,726
says all weaker targets
are to be eliminated first.

226
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,830
We'll show you how professionals
handle these sorts of things.

227
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,866
What, you mean me?

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,535
Hold on just a minute.

229
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,171
Getting rid of me won't
accomplish anything at all.

230
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,207
Sure, I'm pretty,
and I know how to dress.

231
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,176
But that's it. I really don't
have any fighting skills.

232
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,847
Yes, we know.
It's fairly obvious.

233
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,082
As we said, picking off
the weak ones first

234
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,851
is the fastest way to work.

235
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,022
Sure, of course it is.

236
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,225
Well naturally, I know
you're right about that one.

237
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,760
I'd do the same thing
myself in this situation.

238
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,229
[NAMI screams]

239
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,233
[ZORO] And that's exactly
why I told her to shut up

240
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,634
and hide somewhere.

241
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,576
[USOPP] Well, this is the
southeast gate that Sanji meant,

242
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,611
right?

243
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,213
Well, it looks like
the fight is over.

244
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,548
Where's Chopper?

245
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,318
Chopper!

246
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,220
Chopper! Hey, Chopper!

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,890
Come on, wake up!

Oh, Usopp.

It looks like you're
all right. That's great.

250

Don't be ridiculous.

251
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,664
You're the one we
need to worry about.

252
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,666
No, it isn't serious.

253
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,067
So.

254
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,904
This is all that's left
of the Mr. 4 pair, huh?

255
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,305
And here I came to help you!

256
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,907
I, the great Captain Usopp,

257
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,175
the champion of the seas,
the hero of the world,

258
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,011
was going to demonstrate
my fighting skills

259
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,246
by bravely coming
to a friend's rescue.

260
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,916
Be careful, they're still
here waiting for us.

261
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,651
What?! Why didn't you say so?

262
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,267
What was that?

263
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,270
How did that happen?
There's no one even out there!

264
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,139
That's because
they're underground.

265
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,775
Miss Merry Christmas ate
the Mole‐Mole Devil Fruit,

266
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,209
and now she's a mole woman.

A mole woman?

[CHOPPER]
The other one,

00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:51,283
Mr. 4, is a fourth batter,
and his dog's the pitcher.

270
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,719

jabber made any sense.

Man. That was really close!

278
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,925
I'm glad you were
there, Chopper.

279
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,160
What exactly was
that thing anyway?

280
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,161
Like I said.

281
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,565
That's Mr. 4's thing.
He's a fourth batter.

282
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,266
He works together with his dog.

283
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,935
Which brings me back
to my earlier point.

284
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,370
None of that makes any sense.

285
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,239
Ah! Look, he's over there!

286
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,379

Usopp, you have to get
away from there quickly!

296
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,084
Hurry, now!

297
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,993
Usopp, no!

298
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,266
[USOPP coughs]

299
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,600
[CHOPPER]
Are you all right, Usopp?

300
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,072
Okay, one more time.
What is that?

301
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,339
The ball is a time bomb.

302
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,009
It explodes when it's set to,
whether or not it hits anything.

303
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,344
Basically, Mr. 4 can
calculate the time needed

304
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,646
and then hit the ball.

305
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,115
The ball will then explode
when its time is up.

306
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,650
I tried to catch one
before it exploded

307
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,852
and throw it back at him,
but it's as heavy

308
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,087
as a wrecking ball.

309
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,856
There's no way to catch it
and it's impossible to throw.

310
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,591
The fact that Mr. 4
can hit it with a bat

311
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,527
at the speed he does
is absolutely incredible.

312
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,196
His strength is extraordinary.

313
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,298
It's beyond anything
I've ever seen before.

knocked down a brick wall.

to take it from here.

00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,184
He's a gun that ate
the dachshund variety

350
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,518
of the Mutt‐Mutt Fruit.

351
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,053
Are we clear?

352
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,455
Let me get this straight.

353
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,724
Are you saying that
a gun ate a Devil Fruit?

354
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,093
It's a new technique
here in the Grand Line.

355
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,096
Even inanimate objects
can eat a devil fruit.

356
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,631
Ha! You call that lying.

357
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,301
If he was originally a gun,
how could he eat anything?

358
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,769
A gun can't even
move on its own.

359
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,471
You're just making all of
this up, you mole woman!

360
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,606
Shut up!

361
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,608
It's top secret, anyway,
and I wouldn't have told you

362
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,477
except for you're going to die!
A gun can't help it if it moves!

363
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,580
So there, there, there!
There! So there!

364
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,149
Now, isn't that right, Mr. 4?

Mm‐hmm.

Anyway, like I was saying,

367
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,620
you're gonna die here.

You have no hope of escaping

369

now that you've
entered our territory.

Nope, nuh‐uh. No hope at all!

Welcome to a territory
we call Molehill, Block 4.

Look!

374

Now she's turning into a
mole‐woman‐thing for real!

375
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,345
Penguin?

376
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,680
Not a penguin, I'm a mole!
Now, you shut up!

very well, huh?

[USOPP laughs]
How sad.

I could dodge this one
with my eyes closed!
