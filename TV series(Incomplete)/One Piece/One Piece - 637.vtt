00:01:28.343 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.422
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:43.106
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:38.216
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.089
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.122 --> 00:02:46.366
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.738
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.977
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.152
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:59.191
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.834
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.370
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:09.077
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:13.419
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:17.227
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.065
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.335
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.941
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.513
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:29.318
However, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:32.057
that offers the
Flame Flame Fruit as a prize.

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:34.028
The first round
is a battle royale,

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.100
from which only one competitor
can emerge victorious.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.771
Burgess of the
Blackbeard Pirates

00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:40.206
won the match for Block A,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.579
and the battle for
Block B is about to begin.

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:45.551
I hope you're all ready.

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:50.460
And, go!

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.838
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:01.717

The Little Fighting Fish!

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.523
[COMPETITORS screaming]

[COMPETITOR GG groans]

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:22.090
[CHIN JAO]
Pardon me.

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:25.531
Is it all right if I watch
the fight with you gentlemen?

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.267
Are you--?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.006
How's old Garp doing these days?

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.411
Tell me, Luffy.

00:04:32.444 --> 00:04:34.415
Hey, you mean you
know my grandpa?

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:35.785
[CAVENDISH]
You!

00:04:35.818 --> 00:04:36.921
[LUFFY yells]

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:41.495
Know him? Sure. Years ago,
he nearly killed me.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.903
And now I carry that
grudge against him,

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:47.976
his children,
and his grandchildren.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.679
[LUFFY gasps]

00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:51.215
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:05:07.013 --> 00:05:08.684
[CROWD cheers]

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:11.356
[CHIN JAO] Back in the
ol' days, way before your time,

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.796
Garp was considered the
devil incarnate to all pirates.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:17.067
They say time heals all wounds,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.508
but decades have past
and my pain still remains.

00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:22.244
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:25.083
[CHIN JAO]
Hmm.

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:28.857
Speak up! Is all that true?

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.329
[LUFFY] No, 'course not!
I didn't hear 'em right!

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:32.899
My name is definitely Lucy!

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:36.506
Then why did you answer
when he called you Luffy?

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.544
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:40.413
Seeing as you're
Garp's grandson,

00:05:40.446 --> 00:05:42.852
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to pay for his sins.

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:45.056
[LUFFY] Take it up with
grandpa, why don't ya?!

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.294
Hold on! So you two are related!

00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:48.964
[LUFFY]
I call everyone grandpa!

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:52.605
[CAVENDISH] If you truly are
the notorious Straw Hat Luffy,

00:05:52.638 --> 00:05:54.676
I'll cut you down
where you stand!

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.580
[LUFFY grunts]

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:58.884
You know what the real shame is?

00:05:58.918 --> 00:06:03.761
If only I'd found about about
Garp's son, Dragon, sooner...

00:06:03.794 --> 00:06:05.063
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:06.298
...I could have prevented you

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:09.104
from being born
in the first place.

00:06:10.006 --> 00:06:10.675
[gasps]

00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:11.777
[gasps]

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.112
[LUFFY grunts]

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:17.722
[COMPETITOR A]
Whoa! What's going on?

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:19.927
Seems Don Chin Jao's
startin' a brawl!

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.696
You can't be serious!

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.673
Let's slow down
and talk about this!

00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:29.111
[gasps]

00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:31.049
[CAVENDISH] I'm gonna rip
that ridiculous beard off!

00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:33.521
[LUFFY] It's real!
Took me years to grow!

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:36.158
Let go! Ugh!

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:40.333
The Don is getting back up!
Is he going to attack again?

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.706
I don't know how much
old age has affected him,

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:44.676
but in his prime,
the bounty on him

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.613
ran over half a billion berries!

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:48.817
[LUFFY]
The name's Lucy!

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.459
[LUFFY grunts]

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:55.865
Stay out of my way,
Don Chin Jao!

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.034
'Cause if you don't,

00:06:57.067 --> 00:06:59.237
I'm afraid things will get ugly!

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:04.549
Cavendish is drawing
his sword on him?

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:05.684
[COMPETITOR E]
Look at that!

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:09.291
One of the finest blades
in the world, Durandal!

00:07:14.503 --> 00:07:16.540
Parry this! Head-Arms!

00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:19.713
Beautiful Sword! Blue Bird!

00:07:19.746 --> 00:07:21.015
[CHIN JAO groans]

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:26.861
[COMPETITOR G gasps] Cavendish
is gonna cut through his skull!

00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:28.162
No way!

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.143
They're equally matched!

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.519
[CAVENDISH gasps]
Durandal can't stab him!

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:41.723
That big guy's head
is tougher than a sword,

00:07:41.757 --> 00:07:43.794
and the other guy's
holding him off with one arm!

00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:45.764
Both of them are scary!

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:50.874
[CAVENDISH, LUFFY grunt]

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:05.336
[CAVENDISH, LUFFY grunting]

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.543
Looks like he's
not going to stop

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:11.014
unless I fight
back at full power!

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:14.756
[LUFFY grunts]

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:16.492
[LUFFY]
This is getting old!

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:19.565
[LUFFY]
Almost as old as you!

00:08:21.937 --> 00:08:23.741
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:26.078
Did he just KO Chin Jao?

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:28.751
[COMPETITOR K] Who the hell
is that little bearded guy?

00:08:28.784 --> 00:08:30.119
[LUFFY grunts]

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:41.810
[CHIN JAO groans]
What a walloping.

00:08:41.844 --> 00:08:44.414
What?! It had no effect?!

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:46.419
[COMPETITOR M gasps]
Maybe all the legends about him

00:08:46.452 --> 00:08:47.689
are actually true!

00:08:47.722 --> 00:08:48.991
They say with one head-butt,

00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:51.530
Chin Jao split the
Ice Continent in half!

00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:53.567
The whole stinkin' continent?!

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.638
[LUFFY] I wasn't holding
back on that punch,

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:58.008
but the old man
got right back up.

00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:11.736
[cackles] Well, isn't
this a nice surprise?

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.807
You two have talent!

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:17.715
But sadly, it won't be enough
to save you from my wrath.

00:09:17.749 --> 00:09:19.853
There's one thing
I know for certain.

00:09:19.886 --> 00:09:22.491
Based on your strength,
you're Straw Hat.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:24.796
Give it a rest! All right?!

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:26.465
You're the grandson of a demon.

00:09:26.498 --> 00:09:28.537
You steal popularity
from others.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.875
All you seem to
do is attract ire.

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:33.614
Neither of those things
is my fault, you got it?!

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:36.686
Uh! And my name's
Lucy, by the way.

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:38.724
If you had as much
brains as looks,

00:09:38.758 --> 00:09:40.828
you'd stay outta of
my way, Cavendish,

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:42.665
or I'll kill you, too!

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:48.944
[yelling]

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:51.850
That's enough, gramps!
Have you lost your damn mind?!

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.656
[BOO] You tryin' to get
us disqualified?! [grunts]

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:56.425

[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:00.535
It's Sai and Boo
from the Kano Kingdom!

00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:01.703
[CAVENDISH, LUFFY gasp]

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:04.375
You'll unhand your
grandfather this instant!

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:07.113
Not a chance! Whatever's
goin' on, stop it!

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:10.420
I've found Garp's
grandson! My enemy!

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:11.589
Right here!

00:10:11.623 --> 00:10:14.061
[BOO] Remember why we're here!
If we're eliminated,

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:16.566
we can't fulfill our
real purpose! Cool it!

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.302
You guys over
there had better not

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:20.340
be doing what I
think you're doing!

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:23.346
[GUARD A] Any fighting outside
the arena results in ejection!

[GROUP gasps]

00:10:24.816 --> 00:10:27.053
[CAVENDISH]
Those are Colosseum guards.

00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:29.091
I'm gonna settle
the score right now!

00:10:29.124 --> 00:10:31.696
Elimination be damned!

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.434
[gasps] Where
the hell did he go?!

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.113
Don't worry! That fake
bearded guy's in Block C!

00:10:40.147 --> 00:10:42.150
We'll see 'em again
in the Colosseum!

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.520
[CHIN JAO growls]

00:10:43.553 --> 00:10:46.760
So if you wanna kill him,
just wait until the fight!

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.999
I'm not gonna let
you escape, Straw Hat!

00:10:50.032 --> 00:10:51.603
I will find you!

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:54.876
You'll be dead before you
set foot in that arena!

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.847
[GUARD B]
Look at the mess they left.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.586
What was that all about anyway?

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:02.357
I thought I heard
someone say "Straw Hat."

00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:04.562
Ya thought or you're sure?

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.967
They could have been talking
about the pirate, Luffy.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.203
[GUARD A]
You think he entered?

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:11.308
[GUARD B]
Nah. There's no way!

00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:14.749
[LUFFY] Well, this is bad.
I was tryin' to lay low, too.

00:11:14.782 --> 00:11:16.686
There goes my promise to Franky.

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:18.156
[CROWD cheers]

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:20.528
[GYATS] There are only
about 70 competitors

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:25.303
still left in the ring! Half
of Block B has been taken out!

00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.608
Now, the moment of truth!

00:11:27.642 --> 00:11:30.279
Who will be the last one?

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:38.062
[COMPETITOR S yells, groans]

00:11:38.096 --> 00:11:43.405
Hack, master of Fishman Karate,
now claims his 17th opponent!

00:11:45.276 --> 00:11:48.917
Go back to the water
where you belong, freak.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.919
[HACK]
Hm?

00:11:49.952 --> 00:11:51.222
So what made you think you could

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:55.196
participate in a human
competition, anyway?

00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:56.499
[HACK grunts]

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:58.704
[COMPETITOR T] Come on, why
don't you say something back?

00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:00.073
Can you even speak?!

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:01.810
I pity you.

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:05.316
Huh? Don't think I caught that.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.324
[HACK] All you're doing
is speaking nonsense.

00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:12.030
Let your fists do the talking!

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:14.034
Oh!

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.307
That sounds like a great idea!

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.081
But I'm afraid it's gonna
be a quick conversation!

00:12:26.392 --> 00:12:27.962
[COMPETITOR T chuckles]

00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:32.638
What? Did it get
stuck? [grunting]

00:12:40.386 --> 00:12:43.894
[HACK]
Four Thousand Brick Fist!

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:46.198
[COMPETITOR T yells]

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:52.811
[CROWD cheers]

00:12:52.845 --> 00:12:57.453
With that awesome display,
Hack beats his 18th opponent!

00:12:57.487 --> 00:13:01.896
As Jimbei once told me, my
friend and hope of our people,

00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:06.405
We must find a way to create
good relations with fists.

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:10.012
Thus I shall continue
fighting to the end!

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:13.419
So cool! Was that the
famous Fishman Karate?

00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:16.860
Here's our runner up
with a total of 15 kills!

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:20.701
An unknown gladiator who
burst into sudden prominence,

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.705
Ricky!

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:26.746
Definitely one to keep
an eye on in Block B!

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:32.190
That's it! He's cut
down his16th man!

00:13:32.224 --> 00:13:35.831
Hey! Who's that gladiator
in the skull cape?

00:13:35.865 --> 00:13:38.169
Are you kidding me?
We're in the middle of a fight!

00:13:38.202 --> 00:13:40.340
Just take a look over there!

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:41.609
[COMPETITOR U grunts]

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:46.520
[COMPETITOR V] He's a real
powerhouse. You recognize him?

00:13:46.553 --> 00:13:50.393
You got a point. In all the
years I've spent fighting here,

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:53.232
I've never seen him before!

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:55.103
[COMPETITOR U] Every gladiator
from the Colosseum

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:58.175
is trained to fight with
both a sword and a shield.

00:13:58.209 --> 00:13:59.879
But he uses just a blade,

00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:02.752
like a samurai from
the Wano Kingdom!

00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:03.887
Let's test his skill!

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.322
[COMPETITOR V]
I'm game!

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:10.132
[BOTH yell]

00:14:12.839 --> 00:14:13.807
[DOLD]
Too slow!

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.975
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:18.416 --> 00:14:22.156
[GYATS] And with that,
Ricky and Hack are now tied!

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.798
You see that gladiator? The one
in the cape with the blue skull.

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:27.133
Yeah.

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:30.841
Quite the experienced fighter.
Rather odd that he's new here.

00:14:30.875 --> 00:14:34.916
I thought the same at first,
but I've got this feeling...

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.853
...like I've seen him somewhere.

00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:39.625
A man like that who
fought without a shield.

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:42.230
Why can't I remember his name?

00:15:03.773 --> 00:15:07.515
[laughing, yells]

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:08.383
[screeches]

00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:10.821
[COMPETITORS]
HUh?

00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:13.392
All right, Abdullah!

00:15:13.425 --> 00:15:16.164
Eat our steel!

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.939
[COMPETITORS grunting]

00:15:19.973 --> 00:15:22.076
[ABDULLAH laughing]

00:15:22.109 --> 00:15:23.212
[JEET grunts]

00:15:24.716 --> 00:15:26.819
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:15:28.657 --> 00:15:31.061
[cackles]

00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:34.668
[COMPETITOR AE gasps]
You're dead!

00:15:37.073 --> 00:15:39.478
[COMPETITOR AE groans]

00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:40.815
[ABDULLAH cackles]

00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:43.554
[COMPETITORS groaning]

00:15:43.587 --> 00:15:45.824
You shouldn't have
turned your back to me!

00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:46.359
Huh?

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:48.095
[laughs]

00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:52.905
[COMPETITOR AG groans]
Dirty cowards!

00:15:54.742 --> 00:15:55.977
[GYATS]
I'm speechless!

00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:59.284
The notorious Jeet and Abdullah
are quite the deadly team.

00:15:59.317 --> 00:16:01.623
They've defeated
ten seasoned warriors

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.061
in a single blink of the eye!

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.331
[ABDULLAH, JEET chuckle]

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.271
Cowards, huh?

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:11.374
No, we're opportunists!

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.753
So, Abdullah, who do you think
we should cut down next?

00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:20.527
That one! Looks like he
moved close to Elizabello.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.496
Convenient for us.

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:26.906
[BOTH cackle]

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.277
[GYATS] It appears
Blue Gilly has decided to

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.918
start attacking Elizabello
the Second's entourage!

00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:38.295
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:39.498
[DAGAMA growls]

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:43.874
Ow, ow, ow. Damn that
blue haired bastard!

00:16:43.907 --> 00:16:45.611
What the hell's wrong with you?!

00:16:45.644 --> 00:16:48.950
How could you lose to some
spindly, unarmed nobody?

00:16:48.983 --> 00:16:51.689
It-- It doesn't really matter

00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:54.628
how spindly this
unarmed freak is!

00:16:58.604 --> 00:16:59.705
[COMPETITORS grunt]

00:16:59.738 --> 00:17:02.578
Iron whips! That's what
this guy's legs are like!

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.650
Woo-ee! Why not come closer?

00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:07.822
It's no fun when
you're so far away.

00:17:07.855 --> 00:17:10.192
You're not shy, are you?

00:17:10.225 --> 00:17:12.263
This guy's from
the Longleg Tribe!

00:17:12.296 --> 00:17:14.367
So attack his legs, numb skulls!

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.704
[COMPETITORS grunt]

00:17:17.675 --> 00:17:19.646
[COMPETITOR AL] Easier said
than done! Look at him!

00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:22.183
[GILILY grunting]

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:27.226
Damn! His movements
are unpredictable.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.697
I can't read them at all!

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.102
[GILLY grunting]

00:17:31.135 --> 00:17:33.172
[COMPETITORS grunting]

00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:37.982
Fine then! I just
don't care anymore!

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.451
[COMPETITORS yelling]

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:41.488
[GILLY yelling]

00:17:41.857 --> 00:17:42.658
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:17:42.691 --> 00:17:44.427
[GYATS] That's three more down!

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.131
And Blue Gilly has done it again

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:48.703
by quite literally
kicking some ass!

00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:50.139
[DAGAMA growls]

00:17:50.173 --> 00:17:52.310
Didn't you bring any
better fighters?

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.215
If not, then I'm afraid
your king is doomed.

00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:05.503
[GILLY] Hm? This one's
got a warrior's spirit!

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:06.872
[GYATS]
Not much further away,

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:11.114
looks like a battle is unfolding
between Abdullah and Tank!

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.153
--[TANK yells]
--[ABDULLAH groans]

00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:18.896

00:18:21.535 --> 00:18:23.406
[TANK groaning]

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:26.780
[JEET yells]

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:29.051
[groans] What the--?!

00:18:29.084 --> 00:18:30.453
[ABDULLAH cackles]

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:33.125
[TANK groaning]

00:18:39.438 --> 00:18:41.776
[GYATS]
No! I can't believe it!

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:43.412
Tank is down for the count!

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:44.982
[BOTH chuckle]

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:48.322
[GYATS] The military captain of
Dressrosa's Self-Defense Army

00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:50.493
has been emilinated!

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:55.370
Another victim of the sinister
pair, Abdullah and Jeet!

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:58.342
They should be disqualified
for dirty tricks!

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:00.346
Captain Tank can't be out yet!

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:04.153
[GYATS] And with that, over a
hundred gladiators have fallen.

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:07.594
There are barely 30 left
standing in the ring!

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:10.567
Not much longer now.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.339
No matter how tough the
remaining competition is,

00:19:13.372 --> 00:19:15.977
we have the King Punch.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.349
[GYATS] Gladiators led
by the tactician, Dagama,

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:20.386
are protecting
Elizabello the Second,

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.290
ruler of the
Kingdom of Prodence!

00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:24.261
The question isn't if, but when

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:26.666
will he throw his
devastating King Punch.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:28.536
Who will be its target?

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:30.907
Which of you wants to go first?

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.878
For those of you
who wish to bleed,

00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.649
step forward!

00:19:34.682 --> 00:19:36.986
[GYATS] Abdullah and
Jeet, that vicious duo,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.059
have mercilessly taken
down the strong man, Lepant!

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:43.800
Will they provoke a fight?!
And with whom?!

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:52.651
[ABDULLAH, JEET]
Huh?

00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:54.287
[COMPETITORS groan]

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.861

[BELLAMY grunts]

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:06.278
Make 'em bleed, Bellamy!

00:20:06.311 --> 00:20:07.881
I'm your biggest fan!

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:10.520
[GYATS]
So cruel! So vicious!

00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:12.323
Look these words up
in the dictionary

00:20:12.357 --> 00:20:15.196
and you'll surely find a
picture of this man's face!

00:20:15.229 --> 00:20:17.634
He's certainly one of
our top contenders,

00:20:17.668 --> 00:20:18.803
but does he have any hope

00:20:18.836 --> 00:20:21.642
of toppling Elizabello
and his allies?

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:26.118
[GILLY yells]

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:27.754
[GYATS]
On the other side of the stage,

00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:29.190
a duel has erupted between

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:31.729
Jiaokungdo martial
artist, Blue Gilly,

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:34.067
and the mysterious
gladiator, Ricky!

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:36.672
Which of these bruisers
will emerge victorious?

--[thud]
--[COMPETITOR AO groans]

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:42.283
[MAN E] Have you been watching
how tough that Fish-Dude is?

00:20:42.316 --> 00:20:45.356
He's knocked out all of his
opponents with a single blow!

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:46.525
What a badass!

00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:50.033
Yes! Damn, I hope he wins!

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:51.702
[COMPETITORS grunting]

00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:57.246
[GYATS] We're down to
the final competitors!

00:20:57.279 --> 00:21:01.421
Looks like one of these
fighters will win Block B!

00:21:01.455 --> 00:21:04.093
Huh? [gasps, growls]

00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:05.997
[CROWD gasps]

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.299
Somebody, stop him!

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.538
[GYATS]
I don't believe my eyes!

00:21:09.571 --> 00:21:12.476
Is there no depth to which
Bartolomeo will sink?!

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:14.548
How low will he go?!

00:21:14.581 --> 00:21:16.652
[SPECTATOR A] Why isn't
anybody kicking his ass?!

00:21:16.685 --> 00:21:18.589
[CROWD booing]

00:21:18.623 --> 00:21:20.393
[GYATS]
In plain view of this arena,

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:21.896
without any discretion,

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.900
he's pulled out
his unspeakable bits

00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:26.004
and is relieving
himself in the moat!

00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:28.275
The most indecent
act ever performed

00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:29.912
in the history
of this Colosseum!

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:33.151
[grunts] That's
what I'm talkin' about.

00:21:33.184 --> 00:21:34.420
Feels so good.

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:37.394
[GYATS] He's desecrating
a place of bloodshed!

00:21:37.427 --> 00:21:40.833
Someone do something!

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:45.109
[GYATS]
Yes! Finally!

00:21:45.142 --> 00:21:47.514
[HACK] I'm not too proud
to strike you from behind

00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:49.183
if you won't
take this seriously.

Huh?

Hey! Come on, man!

I'm defenseless here
with my wiener out!

[GYATS] The hero that
has answered our plea

00:22:01.876 --> 00:22:04.815
is the Fishman warrior, Hack!

00:22:22.751 --> 00:22:24.655
He won!

00:22:24.688 --> 00:22:26.725
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:31.467
[CROWD gasps]

00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:39.518
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
Gotcha.

00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:41.789
[HACK groans]

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:49.070
[BARTOLOMEO chuckling]

00:22:49.103 --> 00:22:50.373
[CROWD gasps]

00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:53.311
[GYATS] What's goin' on?! Why is
Hack the one on the ground?!

00:22:53.345 --> 00:22:56.051
Bartolomeo didn't flinch!

00:22:56.084 --> 00:22:58.288
That's crazy. What's going on?

00:22:58.321 --> 00:23:01.929
Who or what is this
lewd, crude contender?

00:23:01.962 --> 00:23:04.835
Surely some kind of monster?!

00:23:04.869 --> 00:23:06.905
[BARTOLOMEO cackles]

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:18.095
[NARRATOR] Elizabello the Second
has finally finished warming up.

00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:19.731
Now, he's ready
to unleash a punch

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:22.436
that can reduce entire
fortresses to rubble.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.975
As the Block B battle
enters its last stage,

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:27.180
the legendary king
employs his mighty attack

00:23:27.213 --> 00:23:30.118
against the capable
warriors who still stand.

00:23:30.152 --> 00:23:31.722
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:35.429
"A Deadly Blow!
The Astonishing King Punch!"

00:23:35.462 --> 00:23:38.134
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
