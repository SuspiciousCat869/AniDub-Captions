00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:59.024
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.744
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:13.019
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:16.527
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.363
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:20.768
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:23.440
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:26.178
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.212 --> 00:03:27.983
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:30.420
that promised the Flame Flame
Fruit to the champion,

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:33.828
but abandoned that plan when Law
was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.767
Now, he rushes to the
palace to save him.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.804
Meanwhile, at the coliseum,

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:42.377
the final battle of the
tournament is underway.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:45.684
It's finally here--the match
you've all been waiting for!

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:47.822
It'll be a five-man
battle royale,

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:49.860
including our hero, Diamante!

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:52.665
They must avoid the wrath
of the deadly fighting fish

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.970
and scramble to
snag the treasure!

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.675
Who among these fighters
will lay claim

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.980
to the Flame Flame Fruit?

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:01.315
Listen up, men!

00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:04.221
Get ready for a full-scale
charge on my command!

00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:07.996
Cyborg Franky must be captured,
and if you can't do that,

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.568
then we'll turn the
bastard into scrap!

00:04:10.602 --> 00:04:12.371
The Navy talks a big game,

00:04:12.404 --> 00:04:14.475
but let's see how
much they can do.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.847
[FRANKY] Don't worry,
I'm not runnin' away!

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.153
Smile! [laughs]

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:24.395
C'mon! Don't get shy on
me now, boys. Let's party.

00:04:24.428 --> 00:04:26.934
Anyway, we know
she loves grapes.

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:28.538
She's eats them constantly.

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.806
And why do I care?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.148
We have a plan,
and a secret weapon!

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.689
Looks like a grape but it's
a clump of Tatababasco.

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:41.296
It's the hottest spice
in the world!

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:44.101
Hold on, you're gonna
make her eat it?

00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.606
[LEO] We just have to
sneak it into the basket!

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.846
We will save our friends
and Dressrosa as well!

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:51.984
[DWARVES cheering]

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:54.288
I told you, you're too loud!

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:57.361
King Riku will claim
this kingdom once more!

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:59.431
[DWARVES cheer]

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:08.115
[LUFFY] "Dragon Claw Strikes!
Lucy's Intimidating Attack!"

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.160
[LEO] With this fake grape
made out of Tatababasco,

00:05:30.193 --> 00:05:32.364
I'm gonna knock her out!

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.305
[LEO]
I'm coming for you, Sugar!

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:41.015
[USOPP] I wonder if I should
even stick around to see

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:44.222
what kind of guy
this Executive is.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:47.828
Yup. Looks scary.
Not tangling with that.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.268
Huh?

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.637
[TREBOL yells]

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.175
[TOYS gasp]

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:18.323
[screams] He shot right
through the wall!

00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:20.294
[gasps]

00:06:20.327 --> 00:06:21.596
[SUGAR]
What was it?

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.234
[TREBOL]
Umm...

00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:28.410
I see.

00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:29.913
[TREBOL]
Just a fly.

00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:32.786
[TREBOL laughs]

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.488
[DWARF A]
He sniped a fly?

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.258
[USOPP]
This guy's insane!

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:37.829
He just blew a giant
hole in the wall

00:06:37.862 --> 00:06:39.131
like it's an everyday thing!

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.169
If that's the kind of
firepower he used for a fly,

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:43.106
think about what he
would do to a human!

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.776
A human like me!

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.882
[TREBOL laughing]

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:51.757
[USOPP] Please reconsider!
We can still bail!

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.959
[LEO grunts]

00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:55.497
[USOPP] Or we can rush
to our deaths. Sure.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:57.434
Leo! Good luck!

00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:00.240
Thanks! I got this!

00:07:00.273 --> 00:07:04.615
No room for failure!
Operation SOP is a go!

00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:10.460
[LEO] He might be able to
shoot a fly midair but not me!

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.230
I'm faster!

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.005
[USOPP]
Dang, Leo's pretty quick!

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:18.242
Maybe he can pull this off!

00:07:19.546 --> 00:07:22.886
[LEO] We'll rescue our captured
compatriots, no matter what!

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.823
--[DWARF B] Go!
--[DWARF C] Come on, Leo!

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:26.392
[DWARF D]
You can do it!

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:28.463
[USOPP]
Please! Let this plan work!

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:30.299
[LEO yelling]

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.477
[USOPP, DWARVES]
Come on.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:37.280
[ROBIN grunts]
Leo, wait.

00:07:37.313 --> 00:07:39.519
[LEO gasping]

00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:40.854

Huh...?

[CROWD cheering]

00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:46.733
And another ruthless
Fighting Fish wants in.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:49.305
Oh! It's on now!

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:52.010
It's closing in on Burgess!

00:07:52.043 --> 00:07:54.849
Did that blood-thirsty fish
catch him off guard?

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:58.824
He isn't flinching!
Perhaps he's paralyzed in fear!

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:01.329
Is this the end of the line
for "The Champion"?

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:03.466
[BURGESS chuckles]

00:08:06.138 --> 00:08:11.983
[BURGESS grunting]

00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:17.194
C'mon, fishy!

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:20.634
Shockwave Elbow!

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.179
[CROWD screaming]

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:31.055
Ahhh... The power!

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:37.500
[GYATS] The whole coliseum
is feeling that one!

00:08:41.109 --> 00:08:45.585
Hm? Ahh! That ripped a
massive hole in the stands!

00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:48.022
His special move,
the "Shockwave Elbow,"

00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:51.128
certainly leaves us all
quaking in our boots!

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:54.803
[GYATS] Hailing from the
Blackbeard Pirate Crew,

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:57.676
he's one of their
"Ten Titanic Captains"!

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.447
Jesus Burgess has just
shown us firsthand

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.286
he's truly a force of nature!

00:09:03.319 --> 00:09:06.192
[BURGESS laughs]

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:07.862
[CROWD chattering]

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:09.699
[REBECCA]
He's dangerous.

00:09:09.732 --> 00:09:14.709
[BURGESS laughing]

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.847
[GYATS] Looks like another
Fighting Fish had reared

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.420
its ugly fin! I wonder
who he's got his eyes on!

00:09:20.453 --> 00:09:22.090
Oh! Take a look at that!

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:23.660
It's the fish marked "01"

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:27.969
carrying the much lusted
after treasure chest!

00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:28.704
[gasps]

00:09:28.737 --> 00:09:29.639

[GYATS] He's locked on
Bartolomeo! Just kidding!

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.592
Our fish fiend has
had a change of plans!

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:41.228
Who is he going for?

00:09:41.262 --> 00:09:43.265
Are you folks seeing this?

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.775
It appears the other Fighting
Fish are backing up "01"!

00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:51.415
It's gonna be a battle of
man versus fish out here!

00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:56.358
Who will become chums?
Who will become the chum?

00:09:56.392 --> 00:09:58.564
[BURGESS] These fish are
beggin' for some elbows!

00:09:58.597 --> 00:09:59.899
Just try me.

00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:03.439
[DIAMANTE] You have the gall
to charge at me? It's on.

00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:06.312
And here they come.

00:10:06.345 --> 00:10:08.048
Not today, fish.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:18.571
See? Didn't I warn ya?

[DIAMANTE grunts]

Just who is "01" targeting?

Oh! It's going for Rebecca!

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.504
It's the survival
of the fittest!

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:36.840
We're about to witness how

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:39.546
the natural world
weeds out the weak!

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:43.485
It must have been seeking
her out from the get-go!

I need to cut
the chain at least!

I'm not gonna lose.

style changed suddenly.

with somebody else?

[REBECCA] This is scary.
They're all leagues above me.

This is nothing like the kind of
match you're accustomed to!

00:13:02.297 --> 00:13:04.167
You'll end up dead!

like I'm willing to kill,

I must do this!

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:33.727
[REBECCA]
For you, Soldier!

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:47.487
[REBECCA grunts]

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:49.792
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C groans]

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.105
Yeah! You showed 'em, Commander!

00:13:56.138 --> 00:13:59.277
Now that we control the lift,
we can start the next phase!

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.348
[LAO G] I see you have
some fighting spirit.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.085
[ALL]
Huh...?

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.803
Ahh! Oh, no. It can't be!

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:16.813
[LAO G] So you've hijacked the
lift, have you? To what end?

00:14:16.846 --> 00:14:21.355
I'll defeat Doflamingo, so King
Riku may reclaim the throne!

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:24.862
[LAO G laughs]
Ridiculous!

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:38.890
[LAO G yelling]

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:44.935
[yelling]

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:12.256
[CUB]
Commander! You bastard!

00:15:13.459 --> 00:15:14.662
Cub! No!

00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:17.067
[CUB groaning]

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.703
He's too fast for me to see!

00:15:18.737 --> 00:15:20.707
[laughing]

00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:25.216
You hopeless little fools!
This old man too quick for you?

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:28.556
If you must know,
I'll clue you in.

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:36.939
[CUB]
Commander! You bastard!

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:41.682
[LAO G]
Hm?

00:15:43.352 --> 00:15:45.625
[CUB yelps]

00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:47.828
That's what happened.

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:51.234
We really didn't expect any
Executives to take the lift.

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:53.205
[laughing]

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.544
When I received an order
to protect the entrance

00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:58.215
to the Toy House,
I got a little mixed up.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.188
I accidently rode the
lift all the way down.

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:03.626
So I waited at the trade
port floor until I could

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.832
ride it up again. Took
a bit but I got back on.

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:10.641
Now I'm here taking it to get
back to the Ground floor!

00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:13.011
Floor G!

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:20.994
[LAO G] I won't let you anywhere
near the palace, infiltrators!

00:16:21.027 --> 00:16:25.504
[TOY SOLDIER panting]
No!

00:16:25.538 --> 00:16:27.641
We won't be stopped!

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:44.675
[grunting] Y-You guys
still okay down there?

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:45.544
[ZORO grunting]

00:16:45.577 --> 00:16:47.146
Yes. Just barely.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.587
You two brace yourselves.
Got an idea.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.056
[ZORO growls]

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.898
[LUFFY grunts]

00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.099
[VIOLET gasps]

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:03.478
Gum-Gum... Storm!

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.328
This guy's a pain!

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.031
[ZORO]
I'll handle this!

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:24.220
What the...?

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.135
[VIOLET, LUFFY gasping]

00:17:31.168 --> 00:17:32.236
[ZORO gasps]

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.908
[LUFFY]
What's he doing now?!

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.354
[ZORO]
Dammit. What a pain in the ass.

00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:44.561
One hundred-eight...
Caliber Phoenix!

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:52.043
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:55.316
[ZORO] I don't think hitting him
like that's gonna work.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.890
[KIN'EMON screaming]

00:18:07.239 --> 00:18:08.810
[KIN'EMON]
Do my eyes betray me?

00:18:08.844 --> 00:18:10.980
The staircase that once
was running downwards

00:18:11.014 --> 00:18:12.951
is now leading us up
to the heavens?

00:18:12.984 --> 00:18:15.055
How can this be?

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:21.068
[sighs] Good. Finally!

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:22.772
Please explain yourself!

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:25.076
Were we not supposed to follow
these stairs underground

00:18:25.109 --> 00:18:27.079
to arrive at the Toy House?

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:30.052
First, they led us upward,
and now we are stopped short!

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:33.025
Which means we can turn
around and go the right way!

00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:35.096
Elaborate, please.

00:18:35.129 --> 00:18:38.536
Is your top knot too tight?
For us to go below,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.808
we have to go up to
the palace first

00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:42.745
and then take the lift down!

00:18:42.778 --> 00:18:45.149
It's the only way
for us to get in!

00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:49.357
[KIN'EMON] We have to ascend
to descend? That's insanity!

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.996
That suggests we never had to
split apart from Sir Luffy!

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:53.198
Right! We didn't!

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.202
Why did you withhold
wisdom from me?

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:57.340
Look! I tried to tell you!

00:18:57.373 --> 00:18:58.543
To get underground you--

00:18:58.576 --> 00:19:01.281
[KIN'EMON]
Stay safe little one!

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:02.784
If you were to tumble out,

00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:04.154
I would be wandering
these grounds

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:05.791
for what could be an eternity.

00:19:05.824 --> 00:19:07.694
You must be my guide!

00:19:07.728 --> 00:19:09.464
[WICKA muffled screaming]

00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:12.270
I knew better and you
didn't listen to me!

00:19:12.304 --> 00:19:15.076
All of you guys are such
insufferable blockheads!

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.144
Hey now!

00:19:16.178 --> 00:19:19.451
No, no. We should settle
this debate afterwards.

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:21.856
[grunts] We must
head back for now.

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:24.595
No, wait! We have
a small problem.

00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:25.731
Huh?

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:28.335
Even if we do make it
over to the lift somehow,

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:30.072
security's tight!

00:19:30.106 --> 00:19:33.145
While I'm sure I can sneak on
without anybody noticing,

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:35.082
it'll hard to hide
someone your size.

00:19:35.116 --> 00:19:40.259
That is unless they were unable
to discern my actual identity!

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:46.572
And poof!

00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:48.877
[gasping]

00:19:48.911 --> 00:19:53.285
[KIN'EMON chuckles]

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:56.157
[WICKA whimpering]

00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:58.495
[KIN'EMON chuckles]

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.934
[WICKA]
What?!

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.246
[MARINES screaming]

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:15.162
[laughs] Too easy!

00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:19.470
I'm disappointed.
No one could take him out?

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:22.644
Oh, boy! Looks like I'm
about to reel in a big one!

00:20:22.677 --> 00:20:26.886
Prepare yourself,
Cyborg Franky!

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:27.721
[FRANKY grunting]

00:20:27.754 --> 00:20:28.724
[MARINES gasp]

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:30.994
[MARINE A]
You're the man, Vice Admiral!

00:20:31.028 --> 00:20:34.134
[DELLINGER] Huh? Why'd
no one tell me the Navy

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:37.541
came out to play? So? What's up?

00:20:37.575 --> 00:20:41.015
Please don't tell me I missed
all the fun already!

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:43.653
Super!

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:44.420
[BASTILLE grunts]

00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:45.591
[MARINES]
No way!

00:20:45.624 --> 00:20:46.893
[DELLINGER gasps]

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:50.901
I thought you were gonna
attack me. I'm still waitin'.

00:20:50.934 --> 00:20:52.938
You're a stubborn one.

00:20:52.972 --> 00:20:56.879
[FRANKY laughs] If you're not
gonna make a move, then I will.

00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:59.552
And you're in store for
double pay back, pal.

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.756
Here it comes!

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.766
Ready? Coup de Vent!

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.237
[MARINES gasping]

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:12.945
[SEÑOR]
Ya know, my gut told me

00:21:12.978 --> 00:21:15.483
we couldn't leave
this to the Navy.

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:18.724
Oh, goodie! Do you think
I can get in there?

00:21:18.757 --> 00:21:20.627
It's a mistake to get cocky.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.699
Huh? Who do you think you are?!

00:21:24.936 --> 00:21:27.674
[SEÑOR] Look at that cyborg's
choice of clothing.

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:30.747
He's a pervert cut from
the same cloth as you.

00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:32.383
[DELLINGER grumbles]

00:21:35.155 --> 00:21:37.895
He's all strength and no pants.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:39.131
Uh...?

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:44.007
[WOMEN] Oh, Señor!
You're so hard-boiled!

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.477
[LUFFY yells]

00:21:56.766 --> 00:22:00.072
[LUFFY]
Go! Run for it!

00:22:17.674 --> 00:22:19.143
Man, he doesn't give up!

00:22:19.176 --> 00:22:20.112
[ZORO grunts]

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:23.184
[VIOLET gasps]
We're trapped!

00:22:41.588 --> 00:22:44.729
Luffy, take Violet
and go on ahead.

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:46.832
[BOTH grunt]

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:49.504
Leave this stone bastard to me.

00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:53.713
You go kick Doflamingo's ass
extra hard for me, okay?

00:23:02.564 --> 00:23:06.872
[ZORO] Now get goin' already.
I got work to do!

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.992
[NARRATOR] Under the command
of the fearless hero Usoland,

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:19.899
the Little People break in,
hoping to overpower Sugar

00:23:19.932 --> 00:23:22.136
and the intimidating
abilities granted to her

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.606
by the Hobby Hobby Fruit.

00:23:23.639 --> 00:23:26.645
This fight could end in
either joy or devastation.

00:23:26.679 --> 00:23:28.750
Regardless, the battle
soon hurtles

00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:30.720
toward its harrowing climax!

00:23:30.754 --> 00:23:32.591
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:36.666
"Defeat Sugar! The Army of
the Little People Charges!"

00:23:36.699 --> 00:23:39.236
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
