so she can't take him lightly.

That's why she's
stuffing him with food--

122
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,871
To slow him down and
make him drop his guard.

123

I've had Sea King before,

179
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,268
but this tastes different.
I like it!

180
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,205
[AMAZON 416K]
Wow! It really does stretch!

181
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,174
[AMAZON 416L] It's soft
and squishy, like rubber!

182
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,875
[AMAZON 416M]
Time's up! Step aside!

183
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,745
[AMAZON 416L] Come on!
Just a little longer!

184
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,348
This penne and
Sea King meat is really good!

185
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,849
Getting hard to eat though.

186
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,351
What the heck are you doing?

187
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,318
Cut it out!

188
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,187
I can't eat with you
pulling my face around!

189
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,321
[NERINE]
Sorry! We can't help it!

190
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,657
I mean, you're
leaving tomorrow, right?

191
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,626
There are a lot of people
here who wanna touch you!

192
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,661
Just once! Look!

193
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,831
[AMAZON 416N]
It's taking forever!

194
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,099
I wanna touch him now!

195
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,767
[AMAZON 416O]
Me, too! Me, too!

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,636
Get it?
You're really popular!

197
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,503
[AMAZON 416P] Hi, Luffy!

198
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,704
[AMAZON 416Q]
Can't wait to touch you!

199
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,774
Damn it! You can't just start
a business behind my back!

200
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,010
[AMAZON 416R]
Come on, Luffy! Please?

201
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:45,611
[AMAZON 416S] Tonight
is the only chance we have

202
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,879
to touch a man!

203
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,415
[LUFFY] No! This is annoying!

204
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,018
I can't eat with you
pushing me around like this!

205
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,020
I want food, not touching!

206
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,023
[yelling]

207
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,194
Where did Margaret go?

208
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,996
[AMAZON 416T]
Hey! Where's the man?

209
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,206
[AMAZON 416U] Did he run away?

210
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,994
[AMAZON 416V]
He couldn't have gotten far!

211
00:11:10,027 --> 00:11:10,695
Move out!

212
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,763
Let's find him and touch him!

213
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:16,834
What the heck's
the matter with them?

214
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,202
Keep it down!

215
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,605
[LUFFY] This was all
the food I could grab

216
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,140
before I flew outta there.

217
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,609
[MARGARET] It's wonderful you'll
be with your friends soon!

218
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,744
Bet you can't wait!

219
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:27,812
[LUFFY] You said it!

220
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:29,914
Anyway, I'm sorry for
all the trouble I started

221
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,215
while I was here.

222
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,352
I was real worried
when you turned to stone!

223
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:46,931
But then you protected
all of us, didn't you?

224
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:49,100
Back in the arena.

225
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,368
I heard all about it.

226
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,904
You're my hero. Thanks!

227
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:06,183
[MARIGOLD] Our dear
sister seems troubled.

228
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:07,118
[SANDERSONIA]
And she's not eating.

229
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,220
She said she was
too tired for the banquet,

230
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:10,855
but she's not going to bed.

231
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,957
Perhaps the "forced
assembly" of the Warlords

232
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,326
is still weighing
heavily on her mind.

233
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:23,134
[HANCOCK] Tomorrow morning.

234
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,712
--Big Sis!
--Big Sis!

235
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,360
[MARGARET] Granny Nyon!

236
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,996
[NYON] Yes, Margaret.
Is something wrong?

237
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,465
[MARGARET] No, but the villagers
wouldn't stop touching Luffy.

238
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:55,533
So I brought him here.

239
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,303
[NYON] Ah. Well it's not
every day they see a man.

240
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,504
[LUFFY] Hey! Granny Bean!

241
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:04,041
[NYON] He's welcome to stay
here until things die down.

242
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,243
And my name's not "Bean"!

243
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,212
[NYON] It seems he
has plenty to eat already.

244
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,147
Just bring him some tea.

245
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:11,916
[MARGARET] Okay!

246
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,850
So, Granny.

247
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,718
You like reading newspapers?

248
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,387
The Coo News
isn't delivered anywhere

249
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,023
inside of a Calm Belt,
so it's hard to get.

250
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:21,192
But there are certain
perks when your Empress

251
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,427
is one of the Seven Warlords.

252
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,995
Even with our isolation,

253
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,332
I like knowing what's
going on in the world.

254
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:31,769
Wait a second.
Who's a Warlord?

255
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:33,270
The Snake Princess.

256
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,741
[LUFFY]
What?!

257
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,110
She's one of the Warlords?

258
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:43,480
So does that mean she's
actually super strong?

259
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:44,448
You're a pirate!

260
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,917
Surely you know who
all the Warlords are.

261
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,386
Yeah. You'd think so, huh?

262
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,156
[NYON] Ugh, don't you
ever read a newspaper?

263
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:54,391
Nope. I sure don't.

264
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:57,928
But wow.

265
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,197
The Snake Princess was
crowned ruler of this country.

266
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,400
And she was also named the
Captain of the Kuja Pirates,

267
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,369
around 11 years ago.

268
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:07,538
She was still young
and inexperienced.

269
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,406
But the World
Government put a bounty

270
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,308
of 80 million
Berries on her head

271
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,344
after just one expedition.

272
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,445
What did she do?

273
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,380
The Kuja Pirates
were nyotorious

274
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:18,315
before she became a Captain.

275
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,017
Because of that
the World Government

276
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,519
took an interest in her
right from the start,

277
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:24,521
which led to their
decision to invite her

278
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,991
to become a Warlord.

279
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,960
[NYON] But nyow her
title is about to be revoked.

280
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,230
Since you don't read the papers,
perhaps you haven't heard?

281
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,402
What?!

282
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,437
The Warlords are
teaming up with the Marines?

283
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,973
And they're gonna have a war
with Whitebeard and his crew?

284
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,809
Wh-When? How?

285
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,145
Wait wait wait wait wait,
hold on a second!

286
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,482
This... This is way too much
for me to take in all at once!

287
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:57,021
What a foolish man you are.

288
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:59,990
You don't knyow
anything, do you?

289
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,425
Nyow listen.

290
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,894
That was only
conjecture at this point.

291
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,396
I don't have any proof.

292
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,466
But I'd say that battle
is a high probability.

293
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,836
The World Government
has laid out their bait.

294
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,837
But Captain Whitebeard

295
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,840
would never ever allow
his mates to be killed.

296
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,509
But even with that knowledge,

297
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,279
they have announced the public
execution of Portgas D. Ace,

298
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:28,469
a powerful and high-ranking
commander in his crew.

299
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:48,656
They have announced the public
execution of Portgas D. Ace,

300
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:52,593
a powerful and high-ranking
commander in his crew.

301
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:54,061
What's wrong?

302
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:56,997
Who?

303
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,200
Ace. AKA "Fire-Fist" Ace.

304
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,473
They're gonna... execute...

305
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,180
According to this,

306
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:15,282
a pirate named
Blackbeard defeated Ace

307
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,451
and gave him up
to the World Government.

308
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:20,421
In return, they invited
him to be a Warlord.

309
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:25,659
Blackbeard, huh?

310
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,528
This sends a strong message.

311
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:30,097
The Government has
caught a big fish, indeed.

312
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,632
But more than that,
if this show of authority

313
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:32,733
--can prove that they're
--Granny Nyon...

314
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,501
stronger than Whitebeard
himself, well...

315
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,636
Granny!

316
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,240
Ace is my brother!

317
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,142
Portgas D. Ace, the "Fire Fist"!

318
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:44,044
You're talking about my brother!

319
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,114
What?!

320
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,051
My word! I never knew!

321
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,320
Yeah, and I didn't
know anything about this!

322
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:54,588
He's gonna be killed?

323
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:57,091
But... He can
still escape, right?

324
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,761
Well, I'd say that his
best chance would be...

325
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:02,996
...if Whitebeard takes
the bait and wins.

326
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,331
Tell me.

327
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,735
Does it say where they're...
gonna execute him?

328
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,237
In the town square
of Marineford.

329
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,339
Where Navy Headquarters
is located.

330
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:15,109
It says the execution
will take place in one week.

331
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:16,710
That's 6 days from today.

332
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:19,313
That's too soon!

333
00:17:19,346 --> 00:17:22,449
How long will it take to
get from here back to Sabaody?

334
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:25,619
[NYON] Even at top speed,
it would take more than a week.

335
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:26,687
[LUFFY] A week?

336
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,423
But that means by the time
I meet up with my crew,

337
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:30,457
it'd be too late.

338
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:31,692
Ace would already be dead!

339
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:32,526
Yes.

340
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,028
Then how long to
get to where Ace is?

341
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:38,031
Well, if he's being held at
Impel Down, that would take...

342
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,534
I would say a week
on a pirate ship.

343
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,536
Perhaps 4 days on a Navy ship.

344
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:43,404
[LUFFY] Whoa, wait!

345
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,572
Since when are
Navy ships that fast?

346
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,275
There's a sea current
that's reserved exclusively

347
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,110
for the World Government.

348
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:56,517
From Enies Lobby to Impel Down,
to Navy Headquarters and back.

349
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,585
[NYON] Think of it
as a giant whirlpool

350
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,288
that connects
those three facilities.

351
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,758
When the Gates of Justice are
opened at any of these locales,

352
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,593
usually to a Navy vessel,

353
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,762
then the current from
the whirlpool changes

354
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,231
and ships are ushered inside.

355
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:13,434
However, if the
gates aren't opened,

356
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,402
the ship would keep
following the natural flow

357
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:17,471
of the whirlpool.

358
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:18,739
Naturally, most pirate ships

359
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:22,075
would rather skip this current
altogether and go the long way,

360
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,111
though it's
convenient for the Navy.

361
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,079
Well, what
should I do, then?

362
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,618
What do you want to do?

363
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:33,687
Don't tell me!

364
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,290
You have your
brother's Vivre Card?

365
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:39,827
Uh... Is that
the moving paper

366
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,428
that you care so much about?

367
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:43,730
Nuh-uh, that one
was a different one.

368
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:46,233
This is the Card
that Ace gave me.

369
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:50,504
[NYON] They're also knyown
as the "Paper of Life",

370
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:51,638
since they give you a hint

371
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,574
about the person's
state of health,

372
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,309
as well as their direction.

373
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,245
Then if it's that small,
that means--

374
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,513
Back when he
first gave it to me,

375
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:01,381
it was ten times bigger.

376
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:07,554
Looks like Ace has been
busy on his own adventure.

377
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,293
There's a little something
I wanted you to have.

378
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,328
Here.

379
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,400
Do yourself a favor
and hang onto that.

380
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:22,569
But it's just
a scrap of paper.

381
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:24,638
[ACE] That paper
will reunite us someday.

382
00:19:24,671 --> 00:19:28,308
I'd tuck it away
somewhere for safe keeping.

383
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:30,844
[ACE] Ya don't want it?

384
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,479
No! I do!

385
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:35,916
It's perfectly natural
for a guy to worry...

386
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:38,552
...about his bungling
kid brother.

387
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,488
Ace wouldn't be happy

388
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:43,624
about his little
brother saving him,

389
00:19:43,657 --> 00:19:46,126
but that's still
better than him dying.

390
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,898
Either way,

391
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,734
I'm gonna need to
take a little side trip.

392
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,702
Sorry, everyone.

393
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:15,756
I have to save him.
He's the only brother I've got!

394
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,595
[NYON] Perhaps you
should think this through.

395
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:24,898
Do you have any idea
how reckless this plan is?

396
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,668
You're facing
a full-fledged war!

397
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:28,569
[NYON] You'll be nothing more

398
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,238
than a leaf whipped
about by a storm.

399
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:35,208
An insect flicked away by hands
far mightier than your own.

400
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:36,977
Yeah?
That doesn't matter to me!

401
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,679
I still gotta try!

402
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:41,515
I couldn't live with
myself if I let this happen.

403
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:43,383
I got to do something!

404
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:46,486
Yes, I can see that.

405
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:49,756
So then, you plan to rescue

406
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,826
the most infamous
prisoner in the world.

407
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,762
I give you a one-in-a-million
chance of success.

408
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,598
But in order to even try,

409
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,966
you need to get
to the Great Prison

410
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,801
where he's being held.

411
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:05,772
[NYON] Once they
transport him to Marineford,

412
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,641
both the Admirals
and the Warlords

413
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:10,944
will be keeping a
close eye on the situation.

414
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,045
[NYON] Keep in mind,

415
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,715
because your brother is
the most important prisoner

416
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:16,717
in the Navy's custody,

417
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,652
the prison will be
carefully guarded,

418
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,787
and it has quite the
fearsome reputation,

419
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,422
if you haven't heard.

420
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:25,492
It may prove impossible
to enter, no matter what.

421
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,427
[LUFFY] I'll worry
about that when I get there.

422
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,795
There's no time now.

423
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,498
I gotta make it before
they take Ace to be executed.

424
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,000
Gimme the biggest
oar you've got,

425
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,768
and I'll paddle like hell.

426
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,536
Nyow hold on a second!

427
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,673
You'll never reach the prison
by determination alone.

428
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,576
There is a slim chance
this could work, but...

429
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,312
The Snake Princess is
refusing to follow the order

430
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,481
for the Seven
Warlords to assemble.

431
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,982
But what if that changed?

432
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,884
If she obeyed that order,

433
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:52,819
we could take
advantage of the situation

434
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,921
and sneak you
onboard their ship.

435
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:56,323
Wait, what are you--

436
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,458
You mean there's
a Navy ship here?

437
00:21:58,492 --> 00:22:01,628
Great! Then I'm gonna
go ask her if she'll do it!

438
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,605
Granny Nyon! It's terrible!

439
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:14,608
[NYON] Enishida!
What's all the fuss about?

440
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:15,976
[ENISHIDA] Thank goodness
I found you quickly.

441
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:18,845
When I heard,
I came as fast as I could.

442
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,048
[LUFFY]
Huh? Heard what?

443
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:22,649
It's awful.

444
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:27,087
The Snake Princess.

445
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,489
[ENISHIDA]
She's come down with a sickness.

446
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:30,824
And no one knows what it is!

447
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:32,859
[yelling]

448
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,494
She's sick?

449
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:36,363
Oh, nyo!

450
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:46,006
--Please stay strong!
--Please stay strong!

451
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:57,818
Tell me, am I...

452
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,722
Am I going...

453
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,393
...going to die?

454
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:17,003
[NARRATOR] As Luffy prepares
to depart Amazon Lily,

455
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:19,039
Hancock suddenly falls ill.

456
00:23:19,072 --> 00:23:22,442
Accoring to Granny Nyon,
Hancock is not the first empress

457
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:25,912
to fall to this ailment, and
others have lost their lives.

458
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,849
What could have brought it on,
and is there a cure?

459
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:30,650
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

460
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:32,085
Love is a Hurricane!

461
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,820
Love-Love Hancock!

462
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,556
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
