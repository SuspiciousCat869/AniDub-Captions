land benefit all of us.

175
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,139
Why can you not see that?

176
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:56,042
Do you seriously expect me
to buy into that crap?!

177
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,011
What? All you really have to
do here is cut up a few guys.

178
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,580
[ZORO]
Oh, really, is that all?

179
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,015
Don't boss me around like
you do that idiot cook!

180
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,217
Oh, I see.

181
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,486
You're just afraid that you're
gonna end up losing to them.

182
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,888
You wanna try saying that
again, you greedy brat?!

183
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,857
You're a big baby who's
afraid of losing...

184
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,858
[LUFFY]
Bathroom.

185
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,860
[ZORO] You'd better shut
your mouth right now.

186
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,661
Besides, did you forget?

187
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,431
You still owe me some
money from a while back.

188
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,033
What? I don't owe you anything.

189
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,169
[NAMI] Yeah, I lent you a
hundred thousand berries

190
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,904
for some swords in Loguetown.

191
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,773
And I gave you the hundred
thousand back almost right away.

192
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,041
Someone gave me the swords,

193
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,577
so I didn't even need
your stupid berries.

194
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,680
Maybe so, but you agreed
to pay me 300%,

195
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,783
bringing your total
to 300,000 berries.

196
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,621
[ZORO]
I need to borrow some money.

197
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,790
[NAMI]
Sure! For 300% interest.

198
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,060
And you agreed to it,
you still owe interest.

199
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,596
I gave you the 100,000
back the same day!

200
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,798
You can't really expect
me to pay you interest!

201
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,034
Sure can.

202
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,437
Come on. Can't you even
keep one little promise?

203
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,606
[ZORO grunting]

204
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,743
Now, just do what I say, and
I'll consider calling us even.

205
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,646
Someday you're gonna die
a horrible death.

206
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,549
Oh, yes. And I'm sure
I'll go straight to Hell.

207
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,983
[ZORO]
Damn woman!

208
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
[NAMI laughs]
Thanks Zoro!

209
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,920
[ZORO]
Shut up!

210
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,421
[IGARAM]
I'm so ashamed.

211
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:15,988
[NAMI]
Hm?

212
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,123
If I had been stronger,

213
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,760
I could have protected
Princess Vivi like she deserves.

214
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:21,961
Oh, she'll be fine.

215
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,597
He looks stupid,
but he's really strong.

216
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,567
[IGARAM] If anything were
to happen to Princess Vivi,

217
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,771
the kingdom of Alabasta would
be... it would be done for!

218
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:32,939
Huh?

219
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,943
She must escape! She has to...

220
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,978
[VIVI]
Run, quickly!

221
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,947
Run, Karoo!

222
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,252
There's a ship docked back
behind the cactus rocks.

223
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,921
We're going to take it and
escape from this place.

224
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,791
Then we'll be on our
way to Alabasta.

225
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,764
[LUFFY sighs] Much better!
Now back to the sleep...

226
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,465
Mm?

227
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,134
What the heck happened here?!

228
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,804
[VIVI]
Hurry, Karoo!

229
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,806
[KAROO squawks]

230
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,642
[gasps]

231
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:10,676
[VIVI]
Karoo, stop!

232
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,144
[KAROO squawks]

233
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,718
Oh, no, it's Mr. 5.

234
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,821
They found us!
Hurry, Karoo. Move!

235
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,655
[KAROO squawks]

236
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,824
[MISS VALENTINE laughs]

237
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,960
[MR. 5] It's kinda cute
that she's trying.

238
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,830
[VIVI gasps]
Miss... Monday!

239
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,831
[squawks]

240
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,832
Go on.

241
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,301
You can reach the ships
by going through here.

242
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,536
I'll stay here and
hold off the others.

243
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,804
[VIVI]
You sure?

244
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,007
[MISS MONDAY] After losing to
that green‐haired swordsman,

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,145
we're all going to be punished
for failing our mission anyway.

246
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,848
At least if I do that,
I can go down

247
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,183
while helping to
protect a friend.

248
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,856
[MISS MONDAY] What are you
waiting around here for?!

249
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,191
If you get killed or captured,
Mr. 8 and Mr. 9

250
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,095
will have sacrificed themselves
for nothing. Now get going!

251
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,667
[VIVI]
Thank you.

252
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:13,005
[MR. 5] First Mr. 9 defected,
and now you...

253
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,840
Miss Monday?

254
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,842
I am not going
to let you pass.

255
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,711
Because I've made a
promise to a friend.

256
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,714
[laughs] That's adorable.

257
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,584
[MR. 5]
You are an utter disgrace.

258
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,054
[MISS MONDAY growling]

259
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,223
[MISS MONDAY yells]

260
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,058
[MISS MONDAY gasps]

261
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,795
[MR. 5]
To the name of Baroque Works!

262
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,208
No... Miss Monday...

263
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,992
How could they?!

264
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,394
[MR. 5 chuckles]

265
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,129
That's why they call me
the Bomb Man.

266
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,398
You see, I can make any
part of my body explode,

267
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,233
and thanks to my
Bomb‐Bomb Fruit power,

268
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,735
there hasn't been
a single mission

269
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,269
that I have failed to complete.

270
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,337
[MISS VALENTINE laughs]

271
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,572
[gasps]

272
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,674
[MISS VALENTINE] And thanks
to the Kilo‐Kilo Fruit power

273
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,243
that I possess, I can
bury that traitor,

274
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,245
Miss Monday, in
the ground forever.

275
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,014
I can change how much
I weigh whenever I want.

276
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,017
Right now I'm light enough to
be lifted by a slight breeze.

277
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,854
But I think it's time
to start gaining weight.

278
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,122
Five kilograms...

279
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,456
Fifty kilograms...

280
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,791
[VIVI whimpers]

281
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,860
A hundred... Five hundred...

282
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,194
A thousand...

283
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,165
Ten Thousand Kilogram Press!

284
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,709
So... Do you really still
think you can escape from us?

285
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,277
You don't have a chance
of gettin' out of here

286
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,445
in one piece.

287
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,981
[VIVI gasping]

288
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,385
[whimpers]

289
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,856
[VIVI] I will survive...
I will escape.

290
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,227
I will make it back home
to Alabasta Kingdom.

291
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,199
Take this.

292
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,902
My Nose Fancy...

293
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,336
...Cannon!

294
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,077
Mister Bushido!

295
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,817
That could've been me!

296
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,151
So who is this clown?

297
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,088
[groaning] I just cut
someone's snot.

298
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,223
Damn it.

299
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,026
I don't have time for this.
Don't you ever give up?!

300
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,361
[VIVI gasps]

301
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,766
I'm here to help.
So just calm down.

302
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,768
What? You're helping me?

303
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,169
[MR. 5]
Heh.

304
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,407
[NAMI]
Tell me...

305
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,045
...Baroque Works. Exactly
what kind a company is it.

306
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,286
It's a... secret
crime syndicate.

307
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,522
It specializes
in assassinations,

308
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,958
espionage, and bounty‐hunting.

309
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,861
The "company" is so secretive
that none of its members know

310
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,963
the Boss's name or face,

311
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,132
but they will still do anything
that the Boss commands them to.

312
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,968
[NAMI]
Hm. I don't get it.

313
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,370
Why would any rational person
listen to some big boss

314
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,239
whose identity they
don't even know?

315
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,041
[IGARAM] The ultimate
objective of Baroque Works

316
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,311
is the creation of
an "ideal" nation.

317
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,381
And everyone who does well
within the company now

318
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:46,385
will be guaranteed high social
standing within this nation.

319
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,889
This is the promise that drives
them to blindly follow.

320
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,957
[NAMI]
Now that makes more sense.

321
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,060
[IGARAM] The agents all have
numbers as their codenames.

322
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,563
The Boss's codename is Mr. 0.

323
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,999
So, the closer an agent's
number is to zero,

324
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,401
the stronger and more
skilled they are,

325
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,171
and the higher their future
standing will be.

326
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:11,410
The agents from MR. 5 and above
are especially powerful.

327
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:13,345
Incredibly so.

328
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,916
I take it that you must be
the swordsman who beat up

329
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,019
all the lowly employees who
were stationed out here.

330
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,186
[MR. 5]
Why would you wanna protect

331
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,922
the princess of Alabasta?

332
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,025
[ZORO] Let's just say that
I have my own reasons.

333
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,293
[MR. 5]
Well, one way or another,

334
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,094
we're gonna have
to eliminate you.

335
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,996
You see. You're in our way.

336
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,600
[MISS VALENTINE laughs]
Aw, what a shame.

337
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,035
[MR. 5 chuckles]

338
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,440
[LUFFY]
I found you!

339
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,308
[gasps]

340
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,509
[MR. 5]
Hm?

341
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,212
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

342
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,348
[MISS VALENTINE]
What is it now?

343
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,516
Luffy!

344
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,451
Thanks for coming,
but I got this one.

345
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,488
Unless that greedy brat
dragged you into this, too.

346
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,158
[ZORO]
Huh?

347
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,193
[LUFFY panting]

348
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,229
You are gonna pay for what
you did! I'll kill you!

349
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,699
[ZORO]
Huh? What?!

350
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,069
What kind of nonsense have you
gotten into your head this time?

351
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,537
[LUFFY]
Shut up and get ready!

352
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,573
Because I'm about to kick
your ungrateful little ass!

353
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,675
Un... grateful?!

354
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,644
That's right!

355
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,714
[LUFFY] What happened?
Who did this to you?

356
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,582
It was that friend of yours...

357
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,684
The mean swordsman
with the green hair.

358
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,252
Zoro?

359
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,655
Everyone here was nothing
but nice to us.

360
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,992
They welcomed us and threw us
a party and they gave us food,

361
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,094
and you repaid them
by cutting them all up

362
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,695
with those swords of yours!

363
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,698
Yeah, but... There's something
you don't know.

364
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,067
Just shut up, and fight me!

365
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,604
This guy's just
a complete idiot.

366
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,272
[KAROO]
Mm.

367
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,508
Heh. And now they're fighting
amongst themselves.

368
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,776
How pathetic.

369
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,279
[laughs] If we wait long enough
maybe they'll kill each other

370
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,415
and we won't have
to bother with them.

371
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,684
[exhales] Hold on Luffy.

372
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,753
Can you just listen
to me for a second?

373
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,553
They were actually‐‐

374
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,689
[LUFFY]
No excuses!

375
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,690
Wait! No!

376
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,958
[LUFFY growls]

377
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,294
You trying to kill me?!

378
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,696
Uh‐huh... Die!

379
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,066
[ZORO groans]
Damn it, listen!

380
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,137
[LUFFY yells]

381
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,240
He's gone crazy!

382
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,475
Luffy stop this!

383
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,711
[MISS VALENTINE]
Well, Mr. 5.

384
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,746
It looks like they're too
busy beating each other up

385
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,381
to cause us any trouble.

386
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,582
Apparently.

387
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,584
So why don't we just leave
those two idiots to the fight,

388
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,154
while we do the job that we
were sent here to complete.

389
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,323
Eliminating Princess Vivi
of Alabasta Kingdom.

390
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,159
[LUFFY] Hey, tough guy,
quit running away.

391
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,560
[ZORO]
Listen to me...

392
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,095
[MR. 5]
Shall we, Miss Valentine?

393
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,630
[MISS VALENTINE]
Yes, Mr. 5.

394
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:45,497
[gasps]

395
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,134
[ZORO]
Quit screwing around, damn it!

396
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,342
[ZORO]
Ya dumbass!

397
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,351
[MR. 5]
Now you and your friend

398
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,520
have really managed to get
in the way of our plans.

399
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,490
[MISS VALENTINE]
What happened? What's going on?

400
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,193
[MR. 5] Since you two want
to kill each other so badly,

401
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,527
I tell you what.

402
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,129
We're gonna do you a favor.

403
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:27,606
We'll kill you both
ourselves. Okay?

404
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,141
[MISS VALENTINE]
Now I'm really annoyed!

405
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,008
I hope you're ready

406
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,978
to experience my
Kilo‐Kilo Fruit power!

407
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,014
Ha, ha, ha! Prepare to be
smashed into a thousand

408
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,184
tiny pieces and buried a
hundred meters in the ground.

409
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,820
[VIVI] Mister Bushido! You have
to get out of the way...

410
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,055
[ZORO]
Be quiet.

411
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,223
[gasps]

412
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,793
I have more important things
to worry about right now.

413
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,829
[LUFFY]
That was a good workout.

414
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,966
I've finally managed to
digest some of that food.

415
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,636
He... He fought...
Mr. 5... and won?!

416
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:02,007
He took out one of
Baroque Works' best agents!

417
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,843
All right, now let's
finish this.

418
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,846
‐‐[ZORO] Okay, Luffy...
‐‐[MISS VALENTINE] Here I come!

419
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,681
Everyone who lives
here in Whiskey Peak

420
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,083
is really a bounty hunter.

421
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,018
Which makes all of
them our enemies.

422
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,854
Hey, pay attention to me,
you jack ass!

423
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,222
[MR. 5 groans]

424
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,857
You're just lying!

425
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,894
Enemies wouldn't give us
tasty food, would they?!

426
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,697
[MISS VALENTINE]
Taste my 10,000 Kilogram Press!

427
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,999
[MISS VALENTINE laughs]

428
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,200
Fine then.

429
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,372
It doesn't look like there's any
sense in trying to talk to you.

430
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,341
[LUFFY growls]

431
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,011
You know, you're really a moron.

432
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,046
This time I'm not
gonna hold back.

433
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,015
It'll be your own
fault if you die.

434
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,017
[LUFFY]
Sounds good to me!

435
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,719
Just a sec.
What's going on here?

436
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,789
I thought you guys were
on the same side!

437
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,626
Ready for my Gum‐Gum...

438
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,862
[ZORO]
Oni...

439
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,896
[LUFFY growls]

440
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,031
[ZORO growls]

441
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,066
[ZORO] ...Giri!
[LUFFY] ...Bazooka!

442
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,778
[ZORO]
Let's see which one's stronger.

443
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,781
Your rubber hands or
my steel, whaddya say?

444
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,284
Yeah, let's settle this
once and for all.

445
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,955
[ZORO]
Tatsu... Maki!

446
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,158
[LUFFY]

447
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,293
...Pistol!

00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,930
[LUFFY groans]

450
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,832
[ZORO groans]

451
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,651
Well now what am I
supposed to do?

452
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,654
I don't know how safe we'll
be going through there.

453
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,322
[KAROO squawks]

454
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:12,871

[ZORO groans]

458
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,883
[MR. 5]
Damn it.

459
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,819
Those two are makin' fools
of us all on our own turf.

460
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,454
The name of Baroque
Works will be shamed

461
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,323
if we fail in our mission here.

462
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,459
Mr 5, we can still defeat them.

463
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,128
We haven't failed yet.

464
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,230
[MR. 5]
Let's go, Miss Valentine.

465
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,998
[MISS VALENTINE]
Right, Mr. 5.

466
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,233
[MR. 5]
You can't beat us.

467
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,304
Prepare to die at the hands of
Baroque Works officer agents!

468
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,006
[BOTH]
Shut up and go away.

00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,914

was it to bring her?

490

Now we'll have more

Yeah, quit complaining.

[LUFFY]
A real, live princess!

494
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,838
[NAMI] You don't get it, do you?
We're in trouble here!

495
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,107
[ZORO] Give it up! We've already
decided that Vivi's coming.

496
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,510
[NAMI] You'd better be prepared
to pay up in full for this!

497
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,311
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

"Deliver Princess Vivi!
The Luffy Pirates Set Sail!"

499
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,085
