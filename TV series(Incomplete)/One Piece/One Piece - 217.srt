1
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,215
[ITOMIMIZU]
Team Foxy wins yet again,

2
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,485
claiming victory in the first
two rounds of the second game!

3
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,722
That was your second loss,
so in addition to Nico Robin,

4
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,458
you are about to lose one
more member of your crew!

5
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,260
Therefore, even
in the slimmest,

6
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,197
most inconceivable chance
that you win the next round.

7
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,232
No matter what does
or doesn't happen,

8
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,734
you've already lost one
of your crewmates forever!

9
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,308
[LUFFY] "The Captains Square
Off! The Final Combat Round!"

10
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,346
[ITOMIMIZU]
The battle has ended

11
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,580
and you know what that means!

12
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,115
Time to choose your bounty!

13
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,657
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

14
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,526
Tough luck, but you shoulda
seen this one coming.

15
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,661
I missed you, Choppy!

16
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,029
Don't you ever leave me again!

17
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,235
Waaahh!! Robin!

18
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,503
We'll work something out,
Doctor. Don't cry.

19
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,444
Hey, we're kind of running
out of options here.

20
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,812
How are you gonna
get us out of this?

21
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,481
I got this under control.

22
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,715
We'll have a third
Davy Back fight

23
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,484
and win all three rounds.

24
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,187
Now you wanna go for three?
I don't think so.

25
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,054
Hmm?

26
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,224
[FOXY]
Let me ask you a question, boy.

27
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,725
Do you know why
the Foxy Pirates

28
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,629
are the strongest of the
strong, the best of the best?

29
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,665
[ZORO] You really think
you're the best, huh?

30
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,767
[USOPP] Then why did
you lose to us twice?

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,770
You're splitting hairs
here. Come on... Listen...

32
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,471
You're asking for a
third fight in a row,

33
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,340
but we had five three-coin games

34
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,075
with the Fang Frog Pirates today

35
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,044
before we even
ran into you saps.

36
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,046
Now, I don't like to back
down from a challenge,

37
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,514
but my crew is spent.

38
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,149
They're tired. They're injured.

39
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,651
They've been giving it
their best all day long.

40
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,354
Beg us for third
match all you want,

41
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,690
but I'd be a fool to put
my crew at risk like that.

42
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,626
Being the best there is
takes more than just strength.

43
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,428
You have to know when
it's time to keep fighting

44
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,397
and when it's time to
quit and call it a day!

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,266
Feh-feh-feh!

46
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,236
[STRAW HATS]
Uh...

47
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,306
Uh... What? So impressed
you don't know what to say?

48
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,308
You gotta be kidding me.

49
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,510
First you brag about
how strong you are,

50
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,379
then we're supposed
to feel sorry for you?

51
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,280
[SANJI]
Poor Foxy!

52
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,315
He's so strong he
has to cheat to win!

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,317
It's not his fault
he challenged us!

54
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,152
Even if we end up
winning the final round,

55
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,153
what should we do?

56
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,422
It's not like we can get
Chopper and Robin back!

57
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,656
How can we choose!?

58
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,159
And what if we have to leave
both of them with those losers!?

59
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,795
[LUFFY] I'm not leaving anybody!
I'll make it happen somehow!

60
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,330
[SANJI]
"Somehow" isn't good enough.

61
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,431
We need a plan.

62
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,433
[ZORO] I'm getting sick
of dealing with these guys.

63
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,535
How 'bout I just
chop 'em up instead?

64
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,736
[USOPP]
I don't like them either,

65
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,639
but let's try to keep the
bloodshed to a minimum, okay?

66
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,513
[NAMI] Hey, Boss, I have a
little proposition for you.

67
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,580
[FOXY]
Huh?

68
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,184
Instead of one person
let's bet five this time.

69
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,186
Are you crazy,
we've already lost two.

70
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,590
[SANJI] Wait it's all right,
let her handle this.

71
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,392
Go on, I'm all ears.

72
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,560
The point of the
game is to take

73
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,728
the crew members you want
from the other team, right?

74
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,163
Well, we want Robin and Chopper

75
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,531
and if we can't have them both

76
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,667
then there's no point in
us having a crew at all.

77
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,035
[FOXY]
Huh?

78
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,136
In fact, you don't even need

79
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,605
to risk five of your
crewmates we'll put everything

80
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,206
on the line just for those two.

81
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,207
In other words,

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,043
if you beat us you get
the rest of our crew,

83
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,245
all five members, in one shot.

84
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,479
What do you say?

85
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,416
Sounds like a pretty
good deal if you ask me.

86
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,484
[FOXY thinking] This girl
has some serious guts to try

87
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,686
and bargain with me.

88
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,588
She might make a
good crewmember.

89
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,689
And those two are some of

90
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,624
the strongest fighters
I've ever seen.

91
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,093
Even their sniper seems
to have some useful tools

92
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,494
at his disposal.

93
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,561
And their captain, well,

94
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,266
his 100 million Berry
bounty speaks for itself.

95
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,569
Feh-feh-feh!
Yes! You have a deal!

96
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:39,206
But what's the fun in
betting only two crewmates?

97
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,542
Make it five hundred.
That's right.

98
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,210
Five hundred of my men,

99
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,446
in addition to the
two you asked for.

100
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,816
Uh, you sure about that?

101
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,551
Our boss is throwing
down the gauntlet

102
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,519
with his "Dreaded
500 Man Bet"!

103
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,388
Well, Straw Hat,
what d'you say?

104
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,257
What would we do
with 500 people!?

105
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,691
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard!

106
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,726
[SANJI and USOPP]
Shut up!

107
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,727
Don't ruin this for us

108
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,096
when he already agreed
to the important part!

109
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,432
But we couldn't fit 500 people
on the Merry if we tried!

110
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,667
It doesn't matter
if it's 5 people

111
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,269
or 500 people as
long as we're able

112
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,770
to get Robin and Chopper back!

113
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,105
Oh. Right.

114
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,040
So, do you accept?

115
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,608
[LUFFY]
Yeah, you bet I do!

116
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,410
By the way, since your
team doesn't actually

117
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,212
have 500 members to bet,

118
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,580
you'll have to pay us
with your descendants

119
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,681
if you lose the match.

120
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,483
In other words, not only you,

121
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,184
but your children,
grandchildren,

122
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,018
great grandchildren,

123
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,353
and whoever else
it takes to make up

124
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,222
500 people will
swear their loyalty

125
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,358
to the Foxy Pirates
and join our crew!

126
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,362
Our children, too!?

127
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,666
Hi, Daddy!

128
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,268
Aw! Come here, sweetie!

129
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,470
I dunno about this, you guys.
It's kind of a weird deal,

130
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,437
don't you think?

131
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,340
It's too late to be
getting cold feet now.

132
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,576
And besides, it doesn't
matter as long as we win!

133
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,244
Give it a hundred
percent, Luffy!

134
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,645
Yeah! Leave it to me!

135
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,048
Feh-feh-feh!

136
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,816
I hate to burst your
bubble there rubber boy,

137
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,351
but just as a fair warning.

138
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,752
Nobody has ever
been able to beat me

139
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,788
in the combat round.

140
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,655
You may be captain now,

141
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,091
but you'll be swabbing
my decks soon!

142
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,695
Oh yeah!? You think you
can beat me in a fight!?

143
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,663
Feh-feh-feh!

144
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,199
Maybe so, and maybe not.

145
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:16,036
But this isn't a fight
my boy. It's a game.

146
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,473
[CHEERLEADERS]
One, two, three, four.

147
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:24,511
Who's the man that's
gonna score? Foxy!

148
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,547
[ITOMIMIZU] We've finally
arrived at the combat round,

149
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,450
but before we start, we must
decide on the battlefield!

150
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,152
The two competitors
spin this unbiased cannon

151
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:38,158
and wherever it stops is the
place where they'll do combat!

152
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,493
The match hasn't
even started yet

153
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,494
and you guys are
cheating already!?

154
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,399
There you have it!
The battlefield has been set!

155
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,600
And would you look at that!

156
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,770
By sheer coincidence it's
on the deck of the Sexy Foxy!

157
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,406
Oh, now you're just
rubbing it in, you little liar!

158
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,607
[ITOMIMIZU]
Moving right along,

159
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,210
let's explain the
rules of combat!

160
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,578
Everything within 50 meters

161
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,812
of where the cannonball landed

162
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,748
is considered part
of the battlefield.

163
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,384
In other words, it's
a 100-meter wide circle

164
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:05,452
measuring from the
center of the ship!

165
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,720
Weapons and anything else found

166
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,423
inside the designated
battlefield are allowed.

167
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,691
However, outside crew members

168
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,127
are strictly forbidden
from entering the ship.

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,428
Knock your opponent
out of bounds

170
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,297
and you win the match.
Simple as that!

171
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,165
Also as long are
you're in the circle,

172
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,135
fighting in the
air or water is fine!

173
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,372
F. O. X. Y! Foxy!

174
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,374
[ITOMIMIZU] While we're busy
preparing for the main event,

175
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,776
Porche's lovely
Flower Cheerleaders

176
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,444
are performing on the stage.

177
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,345
If that's not your thing,

178
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,781
you can also check
out a warm-up match

179
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,182
being held on the
front of the ship!

180
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,551
And as always, our
Association of Stalls

181
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,754
is selling limited-edition
Davy Back Fight merchandise,

182
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,556
so be sure to check
that out as well!

183
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,658
Nobody wants your junk--just
start the match already!

184
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,792
[LUFFY and USOPP]
One, please.

185
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,495
And here you go fellas,
two limited-edition Foxy pins!

186
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,397
Haven't you seen enough
of his dumb face!?

187
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,132
We're ready.
Where's your captain at?

188
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,099
He's right there!

189
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,336
Now take him before
he buys something else!

190
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,805
So what are you getting
mad about this time?

191
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:58,939
[NAMI]
What d'you think?!

192
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:01,175
I'm mad at you idiots for
not taking this seriously!

193
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,444
If everyone sits back
and lets Foxy run the show,

194
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,713
we're gonna get cheated
out of our whole crew!

195
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,580
[ZORO] He's running the show

196
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,682
'cause he has the
manpower to do it.

197
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,784
His guys outnumber
us a hundred to one.

198
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,554
Exactly! That's why we
can't let him have more!

199
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:14,722
Luffy won't lose!

200
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:18,425
Why don't we just sit back
and enjoy the show for once?

201
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,593
Now you go on ahead.

202
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,095
I'll run and get us
some drinks, okay?

203
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,499
[VENDOR B] Hey you two!
C'mere for a sec!

204
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:27,334
I've got something for you!

205
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,106
Viola! Some snacks
for the show!

206
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,140
[ROBIN]
How much?

207
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,508
Huh? Free of charge!

208
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,376
[ROBIN]
Oh, how kind of you.

209
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,615
Oh yeah, even if Luffy
loses the last round,

210
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,184
at least we'll all be
part of the same crew again.

211
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:46,420
Sure beats having everyone
split up, don'tcha think?

212
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,657
Well yes, that may be so
but even if we are together,

213
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,426
the captain won't be
our captain anymore.

214
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,395
Actually, he won't
be a captain at all,

215
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,030
since the whole crew will
be serving under Foxy.

216
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,668
I'm gonna be the--

217
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,403
King of the Pirates!

218
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,470
Feh! Feh!

219
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:06,206
You better start swabbing
those decks, suckers!

220
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,741
[STRAW HATS]
Yes, Sir.

221
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:14,582
[CHOPPER] But that won't happen,
'cause Luffy's gonna win, right?

222
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,117
He has to 'cause we
have our own adventure

223
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,687
that we gotta finish
together, no matter what!

224
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,589
I'm sure that's exactly
what the Captain is thinking.

225
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,230
Are you kidding me!?

226
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,031
Why do I have
to pay so much

227
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,400
for your crappy
popcorn and cola!?

228
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,603
If you don't like the price,
how 'bout you don't buy it?

229
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,071
Gimme 50% off!

230
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,039
Get outta here, you!

231
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,208
WHOA!!

232
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,210
[LUFFY]
What's all that stuff!?

233
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,612
[FOXY CREW A]
This is the dressing room.

234
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,146
You gotta wear boxing gloves,

235
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,549
but pretty much
anything else goes.

236
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,485
This is awesome!

237
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,821
Ah... This place seems
more like a costume shop

238
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,823
than a dressing room y'know?

239
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,658
[LUFFY]
Man, I can't pick a favorite.

240
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,727
Do you think it'd be okay if I
just wore all of it at once?

241
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,400
Hey! What 'bout this?
Am I cool now?

242
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,705
No. This is it.

243
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,343
[ITOMIMIZU] That cannon means
the preparations are complete,

244
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,412
so if the opening entertainment
could please leave the stage.

245
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,484
Thank you. And now it's
time for the main event!

246
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,720
The fighters are in place and
the bell is ready to sound!

247
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,722
[CROWD cheers]

248
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,560
[ITOMIMIZU] Grab a seat
in the spectator stands

249
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,328
before it's too late!

250
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,599
Now that's odd.
It's cloudy all of a sudden.

251
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:48,441
Nami! I'm back!
Where are you?

252
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,446
Only got one bucket of popcorn?
Hope you plan to share.

253
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,318
[ITOMIMIZU] Today
we have a real treat,

254
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,119
ladies and gentlemen.

255
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:01,055
A captain versus
captain showdown!

256
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:01,822
[CROWD cheers]

257
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,557
[SANJI]
You did that on purpose!

258
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,526
[ZORO]
Better get your eyes checked!

259
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,494
[ITOMIMIZU]
First, in the left corner,

260
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,730
we have our reigning
Davy Back champion.

261
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:12,466
A man among men who never
turns down a challenge

262
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:15,369
and boasts a
legendary combat record

263
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,338
of 920 wins and zero losses!

264
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,440
[FOXY CREW E]
We love you!

265
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:26,814
[ITOMIMIZU] Our one and
only boss the Silver Fox, Foxy!

266
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:30,150
You listen up, Luffy.
And you listen up good.

267
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,752
Your ain't your
old self no more.

268
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,520
You put that boy to bed.

269
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,756
And now you've gone
and woken up a man,

270
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:38,692
just like that hairstyle
has woken up your wild side.

271
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,594
Since the dawn of
time man has wondered

272
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,229
if the champion makes the afro,

273
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,198
or if the afro
makes the champion

274
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,800
but that's a question even
modern science can't answer.

275
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,135
Now listen...

276
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,670
With that afro on your head,

277
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,306
your fists are weapons
of mass destruction.

278
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,308
Straw Hat's too
scared to come out!

279
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,142
I bet he ran away!

280
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,382
All right, pops. Let's rock.

281
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,550
[LUFFY and USOPP]
Oh yeah!

282
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,054
[ITOMIMIZU]
And in the right corner,

283
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,556
our challenger Hailing
from the East Blue

284
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,125
with a tiny crew
of only seven

285
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,594
and a massive 100
million berry bounty.

286
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:19,066
The rubber wonder they call
"Straw Hat," Monkey D. Luffy!

287
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,269
[LUFFY]
Yeah!!

288
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,572
[CROWD cheers]

289
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,308
Wow! Luffy is sporting
a larger-than life afro

290
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,143
with a personality to match!

291
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:32,012
Yeah! Lookin' sharp, buddy!

292
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:33,781
That's messed up.

293
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,083
Wow, Luffy's cooler than ever!

294
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,352
Ha ha ha! I agree.

295
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,787
[ITOMIMIZU] Both fighters
have entered the battlefield

296
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,156
and look like they're
ready to rumble!

297
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,292
Now that Luffy has turned in
his straw hat for a mighty afro,

298
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,359
does he have the
power to protect

299
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,330
the pride of his crew
and unborn children alike?

300
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:51,465
Or will Foxy's
undefeated fists strip him

301
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,267
of all his hopes and dreams?

302
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,203
Only time will tell, as
this fateful final round

303
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:59,206
of the Davy Back Fight
explodes into action!

304
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,508
But first, a word
from our sponsors.

305
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:23,396
[CROWD cheers]

306
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,600
Hey, Straw Hat,

307
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,335
I'm really digging
the new look!

308
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,572
[FOXY CREW J]
I mean, you suck!

309
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,340
Pull a quick feint
with your left

310
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,676
then slap that chin
with a golden uppercut!

311
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,810
Yeah!

312
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:40,481
So funky! I can feel the
jive lighting a fire in my soul!

313
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:41,715
You see? This is what happens

314
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,118
when we leave Luffy
alone with Usopp.

315
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:46,420
Couldn't he try to show
some dignity for once?

316
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,455
Hey, not too shabby!

317
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,558
Sometimes you gotta
unleash the beast to win!

318
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,360
Not that you have
any chance against me.

319
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,795
Ha ha ha!

320
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:57,631
You might be the champ,
but this one's got some bite!

321
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,766
He's outta sight!

322
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,867
You best get ready to fight,

323
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,136
'cause his one-two punch
is gonna give you a fright!

324
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,203
All right corner man,

325
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,639
it's time to take your
sideshow to the sidelines.

326
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,207
But I was really
getting my groove on,

327
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,542
you can't make
me leave already!

328
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,145
Manager, out!

329
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,746
Get on with the show!

330
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,615
And since I'm not
needed here either,

331
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,183
I'll be on my merry way!

332
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,318
Let's get this thing started!

333
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:25,092
Huh? What the, the
stands are moving.

334
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,627
Whoa cool!

335
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,796
I gotta get chairs
like that on my ship!

336
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,465
Feh-feh-feh!

337
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:35,068
Now then, Luffy, what do you
say you and I have a little fun?

338
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,372
This whole ship is our
playground, after all.

339
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,408
Feel free to go
as wild as you like!

340
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,309
Don't worry.

341
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,744
We have plenty of
skilled shipwrights

342
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,713
to clean up after our mess!

343
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:49,483
Feh-feh-feh!

344
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,318
[ITOMIMIZU] Now, the
opponents face off atop

345
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,787
the fabulous figurehead
of the Sexy Foxy--

346
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,657
which was chosen by
sheer coincidence of course.

347
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,527
What kind of fearsome flying
fists will be unfurled today!?

348
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,461
Get 'em Boss!

349
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,498
You can't let that
winning streak stop now!

350
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,201
Luffy! Don't lose!
That's all that matters!

351
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:10,070
Just watch out
for his beam okay!?

352
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,405
[ITOMIMIZU]
Excitement fills the stands

353
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,240
in the final seconds
before the match!

354
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,410
It's plunder or be plundered
with Foxy's infamous 500 man

355
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,379
wager raising the
stakes sky high!

356
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,282
Will Foxy seize six
generations of Straw Hats?

357
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,516
Luffy!

358
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,351
Go Boss!

359
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,387
[ITOMIMIZU] It's the
Silver Slow-Slow Slugger vs

360
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,589
the Gum-Gum Gattling Gun!

361
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,125
This is a one round
bout with no time limit!

362
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,128
As long as they stay
in bounds, anything goes!

363
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,664
The fighters are ready...

364
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:40,134
And there goes the bell!

365
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:40,801
Feh!

366
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,102
Yeah!

367
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:42,536
Gum-Gum--

368
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,805
Slow-Slow Beam!

369
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:45,472
Ah!

370
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,473
Huh?

371
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,280
My arm is fast,
but my fist is all slow!

372
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,285
You don't expect me to be
afraid of a rubber hose, do you?

373
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,221
Gimme a sec! Come back!

374
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:07,361
Slow-Slow Beaaaaaaaa--

375
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,629
Ha, Ha ha, I fooled you!

376
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,266
Slow-Slow Beam!

377
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,469
Luffy!

378
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,175
Wow, he's floating.

379
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,477
I guess that means
he falls slow, too.

380
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,246
I told him to
watch out for that!

381
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,647
Why won't he listen to me?

382
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,715
Hahaha!

383
00:17:27,748 --> 00:17:29,350
Man, talk about pathetic!

384
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,618
C'mon Boss, put him
out of his misery!

385
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:38,525
Ooooh noooo!

386
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,727
Feh-feh-feh!

387
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,062
I know there's no
time limit, but come on!

388
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,797
Why don't you spare
us both and give up!

389
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:50,070
Nooooo waaaaay...

390
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,006
Nine Tails Rush!

391
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:56,844
[ITOMIMIZU]
Oh!

392
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,480
Our boss unleashes his signature
attack right off the bat!

393
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,182
Straw Hat is helpless
to fight back!

394
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:07,121
This is crazy.
He's not budging an inch.

395
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,489
No, look closely.

396
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,490
He's just moving
in slow-motion.

397
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,736
Consider that a preview
of what's to come.

398
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,803
Though to your credit,

399
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,040
it seems like you can
take a punch pretty well.

400
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:29,076
Fortunately, I've got plenty
of other tricks up my sleeve.

401
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,313
[LUFFY] Cooooome
baaaaack heeeeere.

402
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:35,315
[FOXY] Well, your thirty
seconds are about up!

403
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,452
[gasps]

404
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:39,386
All at once!?

405
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,789
The beam wore off.
He's falling overboard!

406
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,024
[CHOPPER]
Luffy!

407
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:52,266
[pants]

408
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,034
That Slow-Slow Beam
is gonna give me

409
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,469
more trouble than I thought.

410
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,172
Wow beams sure
are cool, huh?

411
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,408
Still, I gotta be more careful
where I stretch my arms now.

412
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,011
Where'd that jerk
run off to, anyway?

413
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,683
I won't let you sneak up on
me with your beam Split-Head!

414
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:14,388
Come out and
fight like a man!

415
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,222
[ITOMIMIZU]
I understand your frustration,

416
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,324
but don't take
it out on the ears.

417
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,298
Did he... use his beam?

418
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,568
[FOXY]
Feh-feh-feh!

419
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,703
Welcome to the
Sexy Foxy, Rubber Boy.

420
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,338
[LUFFY]
That was a dirty trick.

421
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,140
Aaaugh!!
He got me!

422
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,078
Just calm down for
a second, will ya?

423
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,446
Can't you see I'm
trying to show you

424
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,348
some hospitality, here?

425
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,118
Those cannonballs are
moving in slow mo, too.

426
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,786
Well If you can ride on one.

427
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,088
Then so can I!

428
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,022
Be careful, kid.

429
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,258
I wouldn't touch that
one if I were you.

430
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,527
And that one too.

431
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,400
Feh-feh-feh!

432
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,702
Can't say I didn't warn you!

433
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,670
[angrily]
Chirp, chirp, chirp!

434
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,108
[multiple explosions]

435
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,510
What was that?

436
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,345
I can't make out anything
from where we're sitting.

437
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:17,117
Hey! Robin!

438
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,286
Can you tell what's
going on from up there?

439
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,621
No! All I can see is smoke!

440
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:31,131
[LUFFY] This sucks.
What's his problem, anyway?

441
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:34,134
If he keeps this up,
he's gonna sink his own ship.

442
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:36,604
I'll sink you first!

443
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:39,372
Slow-Slow Foxy
Face Bomb Cannon!

444
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,344
Feh! Feh! Feh!

445
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:46,580
Ah!!! Creepy!

446
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:47,781
Huh? Oh, they're pins.

447
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,284
They sure are a lot bigger
than the one I bought, though.

448
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,652
Of course we're
bigger, stupid!

449
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,654
That's because
we're bombs, not pins!

450
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,156
Wait, what?
Did you say "bomb?"

451
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:56,824
Huh?

452
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,558
Why is a bomb talking?!

453
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,128
[FOXY]
I'm the real thing that's why!

454
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:06,634
My punches weren't
quite doing the trick.

455
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:09,169
So I upgraded
my gloves, see?

456
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:12,640
Oh, and fair warning-those
bombs are about to go off.

457
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,743
Feh-feh-feh!

458
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,479
Yeah! Body blow!
Body Blow!

459
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,513
Oh, it's Usopp.

460
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,583
Hey what's going on
with the fight down there?

461
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,451
Huh? I don't
have a clue.

462
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,386
Are you kidding me?

463
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:33,060
Feh! Feh! Feh!

Ah!!

466
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:44,104
Oh no. That looks bad.

468

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:18,232
You gotta float like a

470

this is getting old.

Not you too, Robin!

[LUFFY] I'm gonna
burn so bright,
