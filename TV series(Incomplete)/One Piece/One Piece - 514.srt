Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

Luffy fell into despair,

but when he was reminded
of his crew, he decided

20
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,811

We finally found her!

You've fooled us
for the last time!

26
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,467
It was bad enough that you stole

27
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,536
our research notes
and tried to run away!

28
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,404

our feelings as well!

I'm so sorry.
I regret what I've done.

Nobody listen.
We can't trust her!

with my own two hands!

Don't be hasty, my dear!

Why don't we sit down
over a cup of tea

I'm gonna stay here a bit longer
to learn more about the weather!

Also, my name is Nami, so stop
calling me "young lady" please.

First off, I'd like a house
of my own to live in.

Everybody needs a little
privacy, am I right?

I'll need a bed, too,
and feather pillows

and nice big bathtub.
No, wait--a jacuzzi!

Thanks, you guys!
Sky grandpas are the best!

95
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,347
[HAREDAS]
I don't understand.

96
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,217
You were desperate to get
off this island before.

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,086
Well, I suppose
that's your business.

98
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,754
Could you refresh my memory?

99
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:28,989
How does this place work?

100
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,225
Oh, of course.

101
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,460
Weatheria travels on the wind,

102
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,030
traversing the entire world,
though a bit slowly.

103
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,767
Now and then we'll send
a few of our scientists

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,934
down beneath the clouds

105
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,437
to pick up supplies
and gather information.

106
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,438
[NAMI]
Information?

107
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,308
Yes, to check our
records against others'.

108
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,175
Despite all of our research,

109
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,778
there are many mysterious
weather conditions in the world

110
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,281
that we've only been able to
scratch the surface of and--

111
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:54,948
[NAMI]
What?

112
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,317
Pay attention!

113
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,219
Oh, wow. This is crazy!

114
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,521
Lightning rain?

115
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,290
Indeed, but only on one island.

116
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,692
Quite strange.

117
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,328
It's a terrifying,
but intriguing sight.

118
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,130
That island is located
in the New World.

119
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,733
But of course,
if you brave those seas,

120
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,702
then you've got
to expect the unexpected,

121
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,504
no matter how
outlandish it may be.

122
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,240
[chuckles]

123
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,041
It's a big world out there!

124
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,243
Haredas.

125
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,346
Please take me as your student.

126
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,681
Teach me all you know
about the weather.

127
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,852
Especially in the New World!

128
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,520
Such a desperate plea!

129
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,988
Of course it is!

130
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,958
The lives of my crewmembers
are at stake here, y'know!

131
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,759
I'm their only navigator!

132
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,063
And when I'm on that ship,
then I take full responsibility!

133
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,132
It's my job to find our way,

134
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,668
and I will not let my captain
down, no matter what it takes!

135
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,842
That's because Luffy

136
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,311
wants to become the
King of the Pirates.

137
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,747
To help him, I need
to be the best navigator

138
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,915
the world has ever seen!

139
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,351
Sounds like your
captain is very lucky.

140
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,987
He has such a thoughtful
and clever crewmate.

141
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,722
[NAMI sighs]

142
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:09,890
Yeah, I have to be.

143
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,091
What does that mean?

144
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:14,895
Well, he is determined,
and he's reliable as a captain,

145
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,731
but he doesn't know
anything about the sea.

[NAMI crying]

147
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,242
He's so ridiculous.

148
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,444
Without my help,
he would be lost.

149
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,181

Luffy.

150
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,685
Please help me.

151
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,528
He's gonna pay!

152
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,935
I owe him, but he's such a pain.

153
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,169
Huh?

154
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,674
I mean, he's real
high maintenance!

00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,945
Good! Then you two
balance each other out!

157
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,115
And I wanna give him
all the help he needs.

158
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,552
[NAMI]
Just like he helped me.

159
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,922
[NAMI] Anyway, can you tell
me about the Weather Ball?

160
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,423
Well, it's complicated.

161
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,459
One of Weatheria's masterpieces,
but quite delicate!

162
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,761
You must be careful.

163
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,131
Misuse it and the whole world
could go topsy-turvy!

164
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,966
[NAMI] Can it be used
as a weapon, then?

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,535
[HAREDAS] Hey, why are
you even asking that?

166
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,270
[NAMI]
Hmm.

167
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,471
[HAREDAS]
Quit smiling!

always be my friend!

00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,531
[MARINE A] We still
haven't found the culprit.

176
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,232
[FRANKY]
Hey, hurry up!

177
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:35,569
[ALL screaming]

178
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,538
[MARINE A]
It was, without exaggeration,

179
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,207
the greatest loss of our time!

180
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,975
Have you heard anything at all?

181
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,077
Well, rumor has it that
one of the intruders

182
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,379
looks a lot like a gorilla
if you can believe that.

183
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,649
Sorry, that's pretty
hard to believe!

184
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,051
I don't think he made it
all the way to the harbor.

185
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,919
You can't reach that
end of the island unless

186
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,456
you've got something that can
break through all of this ice.

187
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,058
Only our ships have
that kind of equipment.

188
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,826
People are claiming
the intruder was

189
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,363
none other than Cyborg Franky
of the Straw Hat Pirates.

190
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,866
But the only place
he's been spotted
the past month

191
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,068
is the Sabaody
Archipelago.

192
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,504
And there's no way
he could've made it
to Baldimore

193
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,806
from all the way
over there.

194
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,940
[MARINE B]
Captain Gorilla!

195
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,142
The search team is about
to head to the mountains!

196
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,512
Tell them to wait!
I'll be there shortly!

197
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,813
[KITTON]
What's this?

198
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,983
[FRANKY] The explosion must've
uncovered a hidden entrance.

199
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,451
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Now, that's a surprise!

200
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:26,853
I've never heard
of such a thing!

201
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,922
[KITTON gasps]

202
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,990
I can hardly believe it.

203
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,426
Dr. Vegapunk had
another laboratory,

204
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,894
right under our noses!

205
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,195
[barking]

206
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,097
[FRANKY] This must be where
he made all the cyborg animals

207
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,667
that worked on his projects.

208
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,001
[KITTON gasps, yells]

209
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,202
[FRANKY]
Don't break anything!

210
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,838
You are the last person
I wanna hear that from!

211
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,607
I admit, I did blow away
some valuable stuff,

212
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,777
but it was mostly
knick-knacks and gadgets--

213
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,246
things to improve
your quality of life.

214
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,147
That's nice, but
it's not what I need.

215
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,450
I'm more interested in
the weapons he designed.

216
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,718
The ones he's got right here.

217
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,057
[FRANKY]
This is insane!

218
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,326
There's everything from
battleships to bio-creatures.

219
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,629
And this is the place where
he cooked it up, day after day!

220
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,002
[FRANKY]
All right! It's settled!

221
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,470
I'm gonna live here!

222
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:17,538
--[KITTON] Huh? Here?
--[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER] Huh?

223
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,272
Yeah!

224
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,708
[ALL scream]

225
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,277
Thing is, I'm still gonna
need cola and stuff,

226
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,477
so I hope you guys don't mind

227
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,046
if I come by to
visit you sometimes.

228
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,681
[GROUP scream]

229
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,049
It's not that bad!

230
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,484
As long as you
keep this a secret

231
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,886
I won't cause trouble
and trouble won't find me.

232
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,789
--So do we have a deal?
--[GROUP screaming]

233
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,158
What is wrong with you three?
It's just my face!

234
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,061
[KITTON]
Your face is a nightmare!

235
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,061
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Don't look at us!

236
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,095
There!

237
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,030
Is this better?

238
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,166
[GROUP screaming, gasps]

239
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:46,300
[GROUP]
That's not so bad.

240
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,935
[FRANKY]
F-F-Franky!

241
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,369
[GROUP screaming]

242
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,505
'Scuse me. It's cold in here.

243
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,273
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Then put on some pants!

244
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,344
Perfect. Now it's nice and warm!

245
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,313
You're still not
wearin' any pants.

246
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,648
This doesn't make sense.

247
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:04,218
Didn't you say that you
wanted to get off this island?

248
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,119
[FRANKY]
Maybe before, but...

249
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,591
[FRANKY]
My dream...

250
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:17,130
It would be my honor,
if you'd take my ship

251
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,201
and sail across the world!

252
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,301
Luffy...

253
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,670
[FRANKY]
...because of you,

254
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,206
I was able to
hold onto my dream.

255
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:31,011
[LUFFY]
Franky!

256
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:33,346
Thanks, the ship is great!

257
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,316
Just like you said,
it's the best!

258
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:37,417
We'll take good care of it!

259
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,819
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

260
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,521
but if you want
your undies back,

261
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,024
then you're gonna
have to join our crew!

262
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,660
[FRANKY] To think
I almost turned ya down.

263
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,096
I might've spent the rest of my
life without seeing the world.

264
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,868
[FRANKY] Who knows how
many seas we'll cross,

265
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,771
and what kind of trouble
we'll get into along the way.

266
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,441
[FRANKY] But when we reach
the end of our voyage,

267
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,478
I can truly call our ship
"the ship of dreams."

268
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,684
[FRANKY]
So, listen up, Luffy.

269
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,020
The Thousand Sunny isn't
givin' up, not ever.

270
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,457
[FRANKY]
And as her captain,

271
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,026
I know you aren't
givin' up either.

272
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,594
So, let's sail.

273
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,531
[FRANKY] I'm gonna study
my cold, hairy butt off.

274
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:28,069
When you see me again,
I'll be more super than ever!

275
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,970
Hold on tight, Luffy!

276
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,673
Our adventure's just begun!

277
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,009
[KITTON'S GRANDFATHER]
Uh, hey, your tiger's on fire.

278
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,143
[FRANKY]
Huh?

279
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,914
[FRANKY screams]

280
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,184
[FRANKY] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Put it out, put it out!

281
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,017
[screaming]

282
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,085
Hey, what was that?

283
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,153
[FRANKY screaming]

284
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,988
A monster! Stand your ground!

285
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:48,956
[FRANKY yelling]

286
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,457
[MARINES scream]

287
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:55,862
[ALL screaming]

288
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,970
[FRANKY] That's right,
Luffy, leave it to me!

289
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:06,340
Together, we'll conquer
the seas of the New World!

290
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,476
[MARINES scream]

291
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,146
[NARRATOR]
This day, a legend was born.

292
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,614
And for many years to come,

293
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,949
people would speak
in hushed voices

294
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,818
of the Burning
Beast of Baldimore.

295
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,706
[NARRATOR] In the Kamabakka
Kingdom on the Grand Line.

296
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,342
Say, what was the article

297
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,911
that caught your
attention in the paper?

298
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,145
Roger that.

299
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,748
Odd, it seems to have
calmed you down.

300
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,416
A message from Luffy.

301
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,185
A hidden message
in the newspaper

302
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,287
that only his friends
would understand.

303
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,189
Wanna know what it is?

304
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,058
Oh, wait, you don't
believe I'm his friend

305
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,726
to begin with,
so I'm not gonna tell you!

306
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,928
[IVANKOV]
You think you're cute, huh?

307
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,032
Hey. This meal is pretty
good. Who cooked it?

308
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,702
What a pleasant surprise!

309
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,970
You have quite the
discriminating palate!

310
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,605
It's weird though.

311
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,209
Suddenly, I feel like there's
this energy flowing through me.

312
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,677
[IVANKOV giggles]

313
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,613
[IVANKOV] That's because you
just ate a dish of aggression!

314
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,717
Such creations are
this island's specialty!

315
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:24,618
--[QUEEN A] Yes!
--[QUEEN B] Yes!

316
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,519
--[QUEEN C] Yes!
--[QUEEN D] Yes!

317
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:26,786
[QUEENS]
Yes!

318
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,824
Behold! The chiseled muscles
on my lovely candies here

319
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,059
are works of art!

320
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,360
[CAROLINE]
Ooh!

321
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,696
[IVANKOV]
They belie their gentle hearts.

322
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,065
How did my candies
become so lovely?

323
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,534
By eating the
dishes of aggression!

324
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:45,539
You are... what you eat!
Body, mind, and soul!

325
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,476
Food holds the key
to keeping it all healthy!

326
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,243
For example, if all
people in the world

327
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,612
drank a glass
of milk every day...

328
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,451
[IVANKOV]
...there would be less crime!

329
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,353
It's perfectly logical!

330
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,554
In other words...

331
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:03,990
[ALL]
...aggression is good!

332
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,493
The food you eat
can build your body?

333
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:10,197
Can't say I've ever thought of
approaching it that way before.

334
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,000
Those "candies" of his...
If they could build muscle

335
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,669
I wonder what else
is possible with that food.

336
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,075
Whoa! Does that mean
I could cook sexy food

337
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,511
and make Robin and Nami
even hotter than they are now?

338
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,778
'Cause that sounds awesome!

339
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,513
What are we gonna
we do with this guy?

340
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,016
What do I do with myself?

341
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,550
That settles it!

342
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,086
You gotta teach me
this magic food thing now!

343
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:33,954
Yeah, you wish!

344
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,856
[SANJI groans]

345
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,792
[SANJI groaning]

346
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,761
[IVANKOV]
Hold your horses, buster.

347
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,563
You have to earn it!

348
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:45,633
Listen, there are
99 vital recipes in all!

349
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,502
There are many New Kama Kenpo
techniques, but this one

350
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:50,971
is passed down as
a form of bridal training!

351
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,340
The secrets of Kamabakka
Kingdom don't get shared

352
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:56,243
with just any randy scum
that makes their way to us.

353
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,945
If you wanna learn our recipes,

354
00:17:57,978 --> 00:18:00,281
you need the heart
of a true maiden!

355
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:03,550
And these ladies would
love to teach you!

356
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,085
Not a chance!

357
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,922
Sorry to disappoint, but
I'm not here to be gal pals

358
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,657
with your freaky little friends!

359
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,126
I was born...

360
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,863
...to love the most beautiful
ladies in the world!

361
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,398
[IVANKOV]
Not!

362
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,034
Hee-haw!

363
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,503
[QUEENS cheering]

364
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,473
Well, quirks aside,
you've got guts, boy.

365
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,674
I like you,

366
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,542
so that means
I'll give you a chance!

367
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:29,376
[SANJI]
Oh, yeah?

368
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,346
[IVANKOV chuckles]

369
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,547
But a chance is just a chance,

370
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,651
because I'll be giving the
recipes to the 99 grand masters

371
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,388
of New Kama Kenpo
on this island.

372
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,555
If you're half the man
you think you are,

373
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,126
you can defeat them and claim
the recipes for yourself.

374
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,896
Also, do not let
your guard down,

375
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,964
because every
New Kama on the island

376
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,601
will be trying to put this
adorable dress on you!

377
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,571
Hope you have fun protecting
your fragile manhood.

378
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,007
--[SANJI grunts]
--[QUEENS chuckle]

379
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,109
[QUEEN E]
Oh, Sanji!

380
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,044
[QUEEN F]
Say goodbye to sleeping!

381
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,579
[CAROLINE]
This sweet dress...

382
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,349
If you've never worn one before,
you're in for a treat!

383
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,050
They're so breathable!

384
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,318
--[SANJI gasps]
--[ELIZABETH] Join us!

385
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,987
It's nice to be girly!

386
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,189
[screams]

387
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,790
[IVANKOV]
It's just you

388
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,660
versus the island
of New Kama Kenpo!

389
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,328
Let's begin!

390
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,531
If you can win this fight,
I'll also throw in a ship!

391
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,001
Not a bad deal, if you ask me!

392
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,769
So, what do ya say, boy?

393
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:29,803
[SANJI gasps]

394
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,606
[LUFFY]
So listen, Mr.Cook!

395
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,108
Why don't you leave
this boat and join my crew?

396
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,812
--Huh?
--[LUFFY] I could use a cook

397
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,014
like you on my pirate ship!

398
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:41,114
[gasps]

399
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,885
I'm not worried.

400
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:50,891
[SANJI]
Hmph.

401
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,697
Because I don't think it's time
for me to die just yet.

402
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,000
[ZEFF] I've seen one
or two like him before--

403
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,935
stubborn kids who'd rather die

404
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,205
than have to turn away from
a fight once it's started.

405
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:12,379
I don't believe
I've heard an answer.

406
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,415
Could it be that
you've given up already?

407
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,650
Well, if you quit, then we--

408
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,052
[SANJI]
When I win this...

409
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,319
[IVANKOV]
Huh?

410
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:22,456
When I finish
beating all of them,

411
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,825
I bet I'll be a whole lot
stronger than I am now.

412
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,496
[ZEFF]
Even with 100,000 more weapons,

413
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,366
our chore boy can still
bring him to his knees

414
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,901
because he does not know fear.

415
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:37,571
[SANJI]
Hey, Luffy,

416
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,273
hang in there just
a little while longer.

417
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,877
[SANJI] I promised myself
that one of these days

418
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,379
I'll go to the Grand Line.

419
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,481
[LUFFY laughs]
Well, let's go right now!

420
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:50,250
[SANJI] It just isn't
the right time--not yet.

421
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,022
[SANJI] Say, have you
ever heard of the All Blue?

422
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:55,922
[LUFFY]
No.

423
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,591
[SANJI]
You've got to be kidding me.

424
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,826
That sea is a miracle.

425
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:06,333
Your dream is foolish.
Then again, so's mine.

426
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,103
Now is as good a time as any.

427
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,739
Why not start
my quest right now?

428
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:13,941
[LUFFY]
Sanji.

429
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,743
[SANJI]
I'll be joining your little crew

430
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,245
on your journey to
be King of the Pirates.

431
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,081
[gasps]

432
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:21,849
Do you hear me, Luffy?

433
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,884
I wanna be your cook.

434
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,421
[SANJI]
Luffy, when we meet again...

435
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,559
[SANJI]
...you'll see.

436
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,829
[SANJI] I'll be the best damn
chef in all of the New World.

437
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:39,332
I'll make food fit for
the King of the Pirates!

438
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,335
[SANJI]
Until then...

439
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,373
[SANJI]
...I must survive...

440
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,475
...this hell.

441
00:21:51,946 --> 00:21:54,982
[SANJI]
I accept your challenge.

442
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,917
Now give me your worst!

443
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,752
[QUEENS yelling]

444
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,153
That's better!

445
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:02,789
Remember, we're not
going easy on you!

446
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,258
Just shut up and fight me.

447
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:07,728
[IVANKOV] You heard
him, ladies! Go to town!

448
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:08,862
[SANJI grunting]

449
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,798
[GREEN HAIR QUEEN]
Hi, Sanji!

450
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,700
Aww, don't give me
the cold shoulder!

451
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:14,335
[SANJI]
Can it!

452
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:16,303
How feisty!

453
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,938
[GREEN HAIR QUEEN yells]

454
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,640
[SANJI groans]

455
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,774
[SANJI]
Pull it together!

456
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,577
I can't lose yet! Not to you!

457
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,611
[gasps]

458
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,780
[SANJI groans]

459
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,015
[ELIZABETH groans]

460
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,449
That wasn't nice!

461
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,486
[SANJI groans]

462
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,055
--[QUEEN G] Peekaboo!

--[PINK HAIR QUEEN grunts]

464
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:38,792
[SANJI]
Luffy,

465
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:41,528
both of us are getting through
this, no matter what it takes!

466
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:44,698
So, I heard you're
fighting me for my recipe?

467
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:48,535
Well, Caroline is ready!
Come and get it, if you dare!

468
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,905
This is convenient.

469
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:55,442
After that last battle we had,
I owe you a proper beatdown!

470
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,710
[CAROLINE yelling]

471
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:57,878
[SANJI yelling]

472
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,512
Here I come!

473
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:04,551
[SANJI]
Make no mistake--I will win!

474
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:15,696
[NARRATOR]
With their reunion on hold,

475
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,164
each member of
the Straw Hat Crew

476
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,165
finds a new goal to strive for.

477
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,836
Thankfully, their surroundings
are ripe with opportunity.

478
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:24,505
Determined to push
forward into the New World,

479
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,940
they vow to show their captain

480
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,874
their new strength
the next time they meet.

481
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,810
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

482
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:34,214
"I Will Get Much, Much Stronger!
Zoro's Pledge to His Captain!"

483
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,950
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
