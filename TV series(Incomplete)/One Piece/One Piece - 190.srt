1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,781
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,950
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,384
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,389
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,521
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:59,442
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,486
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:07,242
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:21,798
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,093
[NARRATOR] Last time, Eneru
continued his brutal attack

25
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:27,470
on Skypiea and
all of its people.

26
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,264
[ENERU]
Everything is an eyesore!

27
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,725
The people, the trees, the land!

28
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,977
Return to where you belong!

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,147
Let everything
rain into the Blue Sea!

30
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,484
[SKY PEOPLE yell]

31
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,529
[SKY PEOPLE yell]

32
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,282
Get to the boats!

33
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:49,659
Angel Island won't
last much longer!

34
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:52,620
[SKY PEOPLE yell]

35
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:54,039
[MCKINLEY] What would've
happened if that girl

36
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,874
had approached me any later?

37
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,296
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Robin and Usopp's group

38
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,340
wait at the base of Giant Jack.

39
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,594
[ROBIN]
He's far above now.

40
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:09,637
It's only a matter
of time until his ship

41
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,389
reaches the top of the vine.

42
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:13,266
I don't get it.

43
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,435
What is it that
Eneru wants there?

44
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,979
I believe he's trying
to get to the golden bell.

45
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,105
A bell?

46
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:23,651
[ENERU] The little angels will
scurry like ants they are!

47
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:28,656
Return to where
you belong, Skypeia!

48
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:43,963
There is only one thing
in this land that I want.

49
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:46,216
The gold belfry!

50
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:49,636
[NARRATOR]
And Luffy charges up Giant Jack

51
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,471
on a mission to rescue Nami.

52
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:53,890
[LUFFY]
Hang in there, Nami.

53
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,892
I'll take care of this.
I promise!

54
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:59,229
Eneru! I'll never let you
have the golden bell!

55
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,865
[LUFFY]
"Angel Island Obliterated!

56
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,326
The Horror of
the Raigo's Advent!"

57
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:20,625
[USOPP yelps]

58
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:23,169
[USOPP gasps]

59
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,050
[WYPER]
A golden bell.

60
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,427
[USOPP gasps]

61
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,511
[WYPER]
Tell me.

62
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,096
That's what you said, isn't it.

63
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,222
[AISA]
Wyper!

64
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:35,056
[ROBIN]
Yes.

65
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,516
[USOPP]
Uh... uh...

66
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,601
Who was talking
about a golden bell?

67
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,854
Just before you were
struck by that lightning bolt,

68
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:42,480
you were speaking
of a golden bell

69
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,357
which Eneru desires.

70
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:47,152
Now that we know
what Eneru's going for,

71
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,195
you have to tell me where it is.

72
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,448
[USOPP] Mmm... Hold on,
could we just think about this

73
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,283
for one second, guys?!

74
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,076
You saw that thunderbolt!

75
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,662
We're as good as dead
if we don't get out of here!

76
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,042
It's up this beanstalk.

77
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,877
Somewhere close to the top.

78
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,879
You're sure?
How do you know this?

79
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,005
[USOPP]
Wait!

80
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,676
We promised Nami that we'd
wait back on the ship!

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,220
She's gonna be back
with Luffy any time now!

82
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:15,764
I'm sure!

83
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:17,932
The coward's right this time!

84
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:21,519
The ruins of Shandora are in
the layer directly beneath us.

85
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:24,731
The giant beanstalk pierces
the very center of the city.

86
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,362
[USOPP]
Oh, man!

87
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:32,280
These ruins or whatever
they are got blasted to dust!

88
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,700
And if we don't get
outta here right now,

89
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,535
we're gonna be next!

90
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,746
[ROBIN] In the ruins, I
discovered a map that revealed

91
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,706
the location of the
grand belfry that holds

92
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,041
the golden bell.

93
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,876
It indicated that it could
be found in the heart

94
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,336
of the ancient city.

95
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:47,462
[USOPP whines]

96
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:50,006
Hey! Why are you ignoring me?

97
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,300
[ROBIN] To put it simply,
the force of the impact

98
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,969
with the vine must have
sent the bell hurling skyward

99
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,513
to its present location.

100
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,728
[WYPER]
Then it's directly above us.

101
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,232
[GAN FALL]
The singing voice of the island.

102
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:18,535
[LUFFY]
Hey!

103
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:26,334
The City of Gold's got
a really big bell in it, right?

104
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,627
[chuckles]

105
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:37,012
Finally. I'm above Giant Jack.

106
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:38,263
Virgin sky.

107
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,348
I certainly never had
reason to come up here

108
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:43,518
and I doubt anyone else
has either-- now where is it?

109
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,022
After 400 years...

110
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,607
...it will be found.

111
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:53,570
The golden bell.

112
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:54,696
Hm?

113
00:06:56,197 --> 00:07:01,161
[LUFFY panting]

114
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:07,250
[yelling]

115
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:14,090
What's with this place?

116
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,184
[ENERU]
Him.

117
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,521
It would appear that I
underestimated the little rat.

118
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,399
Ha! Gotcha!

119
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,778
Stay right there!

120
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,739
Eneru!

121
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,408
Absurd.

122
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,911
[LUFFY grunts, yells]

123
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:55,715
[yelling]

124
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,259
[ENERU laughs]

125
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:01,012
[LUFFY yelling]

126
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,392
Uh, Wyper?

127
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:06,976
What're you planning to do?

128
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,562
Don't tell me you're gonna
climb the beanstalk!

129
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,695
Everyone!
Get away from the beanstalk!

130
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,488
Something's falling!

131
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:20,949
[USOPP yells]

132
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:23,952
[AISA yells]

133
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,664
The top of the stalk!

134
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:29,457
What's happening up there?

135
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,543
Oh, no! Don't tell me
Luffy and Nami fell with it!

136
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:33,169
I just don't think
I could take it!

137
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,379
[AISA]
Wyper!

138
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,672
[WYPER groans]

139
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:37,465
[AISA]
No! You can't go!

140
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,883
Not in this condition!

141
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:40,593
Look at yourself,
you're a wreck!

142
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:41,970
You'd never make it!

143
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:44,097
And even if you did,
there's no way to reach Eneru

144
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,057
while he's flying on that ship!

145
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,477
The bell.
It's directly above us.

146
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:56,192
Great Warrior Kalgara
longed to hear its sound.

147
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:58,403
Great Warrior Kalgara?

148
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,739
[WYPER]
Yes.

149
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,574
That is our true goal.

150
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:07,871
[WYPER]
Eneru!

151
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:10,331
I swear you will
never take the bell!

152
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:22,010
[LUFFY grunting]

153
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,386
[ENERU chuckles]

154
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,305
This little predicament
will make it very difficult

155
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,724
indeed for you to
reach me, won't it?

156
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,892
[LUFFY grunts]

157
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,393
You just wait!

158
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:32,479
[grunting]

159
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:40,278
[laughing]

160
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,322
Hang around a
little bit longer...

161
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,201
...and I'll show you
something miraculous.

162
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,413
Show you... something...?

163
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,219
What is all that?

164
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh, yeah.

165
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,934
I guess I should get out of
this while he's not around.

166
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,813
[grunting]

167
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,274
That's my only shot!

[LUFFY yelling]

173
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:46,302
[NAMI]
What is he doing?!

174
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:49,931
[LUFFY grunting]

175
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:55,437
Wow. My plan totally worked!

176
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,273
All right, now's my chance
to get on board that ark!

177
00:10:58,356 --> 00:10:59,566
[grunts]

178
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:03,319
Luffy!

00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,157
What are you doing here, Nami?
I haven't rescued you yet.

180
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,117
I came to rescue you, you dolt!

181
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,870
Sanji and Usopp saved me
so I was safe down below

182
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:13,163
this whole time.

183
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:16,791
Really? You were? That's great.

184
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,084
I was worried.

185
00:11:18,168 --> 00:11:19,627
More importantly...

186
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,463
Wait.

187
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:23,506
What's that?

188
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,216
[rumbling continues]

189
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,512
The thunderclouds.

190
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,139
They're changing shape.

191
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:39,022
[SKY PERSON A, B]
The sky! Save us!

192
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,107
[SKY PERSON C] Oh, no!
Somebody please help us!

193
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:43,193
[SKY PERSON D]
The sky! It's pitch black!

194
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:44,486
[WOMAN]
What's happening?

195
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,570
[DAUGHTER]
Mama!

196
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,864
Move it!
Everyone to the sea!

197
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,949
[SKY PEOPLE yelling]

198
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,577
[SKY PERSON E] There's a giant
ball floating in the sky!

199
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,205
[SKY PEOPLE yelling]

200
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:59,542
I have a bad feeling about this.

201
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:01,419
That ball coming through
the clouds over there

202
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,047
is a massive thunderhead.

203
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,549
And it's bursting at the
seams with hurricane winds

204
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,343
and deadly lightning bolts.

205
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:24,609
It's right above...
Angel Island!

206
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,778
A thundercloud
shaped like a sphere.

207
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,281
Unreal...

208
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,659
This has got to be a nightmare.

209
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,495
[GAN FALL]
What is this?

210
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,415
What new horrors
could he unleash next?

211
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,853
[SKY PERSON F]
Hurry! Get to the ocean!

212
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,105
[SKY PERSON G]
Wait for me!

213
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:10,447
[ENERU laughs]

214
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,533
Now everyone will know
that the skies are mine!

215
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:18,413
With the powers of the ark,
Maxim, and myself,

216
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:20,331
I am unstoppable!

217
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,626
I have become truly omnipotent!

218
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,836
[SKY PERSON H]
Look!

219
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,213
[SKY PERSON I]
It's falling onto Angel Island!

220
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:29,507
[SKY PEOPLE chattering]

221
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:35,972
[SKY PERSON J]
It's too late!

222
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:37,515
[SKY PERSON K]
We're not gonna make it!

223
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,809
[SKY PERSON L]
Hurry! Everybody run!

224
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:41,061
[WOMAN SKY PERSON]
I'm so scared!

225
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:42,604
[SKY PEOPLE yelling]

226
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,904
[ENERU]
Raigo.

227
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,186
I don't believe it.
That's impossible!

228
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,230
[SKY PERSON N]
Did the White Berets escape?

229
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,233
[SKY PERSON O]
The White Berets saved us all.

230
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:31,528
The entire island
has been destroyed.

231
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,030
Our precious homeland
is gone forever!

232
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,963
[SKY PERSON M] Even the sea
clouds were obliterated.

233
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,053
[ENERU laughing]

234
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:59,472
What a glorious sight to behold!

235
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,308
Now this is what the
sky should look like.

236
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,859
[USOPP] Wh-What kind
of explosion was that?

237
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,360
Not to mention,

238
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,447
that terrible lightning is
still falling down like rain!

239
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,990
I don't think any
of us stand a chance

240
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:19,075
of getting out of here alive!

241
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,619
Angel Island's gone.

242
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,496
How could you?

243
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,748
Eneru...

244
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,668
What cruelty.

245
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,129
What monstrous cruelty!

246
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,432
[rumbling]

247
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,933
What is that rumbling?

248
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:46,436
[SUU]
Suu! Suu...

249
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,271
We'll wait.

250
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:51,107
We have to take them back
safely to the Blue Sea.

251
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:53,860
[NAMI]
Luffy!

252
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,029
Get on so we can
get back down there!

253
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,282
Everyone else is headed for
the ship and we should be too!

254
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,202
I can't.

255
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,578
Can't? Why not?

256
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:04,829
What are you saying?

257
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:06,289
Yeah, you can.

258
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,750
I don't have to save
you anymore, but...

259
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,544
I still have some
unfinished business!

260
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:14,297
Unfinished business?
What's left to do here?

261
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,092
Are you trying
to get back at Eneru?

262
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,428
That golden bell is somewhere
up there in the sky!

263
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,223
You're after the bell? Luffy!

264
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:25,767
Your life is more
important than gold.

265
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,143
Look at that!

266
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,270
Even if the lightning
doesn't hurt you,

267
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:33,858
he can still destroy you
a thousand other ways!

268
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:37,153
If it's gold you want, you have
a load of it on your arm!

269
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,115
So give up the bell, Luffy,
for your own sake!

270
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:44,786
I won't die.

271
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:46,830
Will you quit it, already?
You know that he--

272
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:49,374
You saw it, right?

273
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:50,709
Saw what?

274
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,798
The City of Gold.

275
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:59,175
You know for a fact
it exists, right?

276
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,640
Then it wasn't a lie!

277
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,602
[LUFFY]
Old Timer's ancestor.

278
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,442
[CRICKET] I don't care
if I find the city or not.

279
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,111
I'm not here to prove
Noland right or wrong.

280
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:21,364
I have no interest
in rewriting history.

281
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,826
All I'm doing is following
what I believe is my destiny.

282
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,037
This is between me and Noland.

283
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,580
[LUFFY]
He wasn't a liar.

284
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,252
I have to let Old Timer and
the others down below know...

285
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,883
...that the City of Gold
is up in the sky!

286
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:45,138
If I ring the bell...

287
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:49,017
...then they should
be able to hear it.

288
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,102
Otherwise, Old Timer
and his monkey pals

289
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,230
will keep searching the ocean
floor until the day they die!

290
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,153
[NAMI]
Luffy...

291
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,032
Eneru won't take
the golden bell.

292
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,992
The sound from a bell that huge

293
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:08,870
will be heard far and wide
by people everywhere.

294
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:14,626
So I'm not stopping until I hear
the sounds of the golden bell!

295
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,924
[LUFFY] The City of Gold's got
a really big bell in it, right?

296
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,346
Noland did mention
that in his logbook, yes.

297
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:29,349
A great bell in
the City of Gold.

298
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:30,725
Why do you ask, Luffy?

299
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,560
Yeah, why do you ask, Luffy?

300
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,312
[LUFFY chuckling]

301
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,106
I got a really good idea.

302
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,818
Well, tell me!

303
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,737
If we give that ginormous
bell a good ringing,

304
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,365
I bet that Old Timer and
those monkeys down below

305
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:46,991
would hear it. Don'tcha think?

306
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,993
[chuckles]

307
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,414
Yeah, I bet they would.

308
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,837
When he says that he's
gonna do something, he does it.

309
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,797
Wait. He's gonna...

310
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,842
Yes, he did say that.

311
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,552
But given the situation...

312
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,975
[WYPER]
Ring?

313
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,602
He's going to ring the bell?

314
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,478
That's right.

315
00:19:15,562 --> 00:19:17,856
No matter how hard Nami tries,

316
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,400
Luffy won't leave
until he rings that bell.

317
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:23,319
You see, Luffy is after
the same thing as Eneru.

318
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,583
[LUFFY yells]

319
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:39,961
Got it!

320
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,549
[ENERU laughs]

321
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:45,842
As captain of this ship,

322
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:48,470
I do not give you
permission to board.

323
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,929
Eneru!

324
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,268
[LUFFY yelling]

325
00:19:58,813 --> 00:19:59,856
[NAMI]
Luffy!

326
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:03,318
See, I told you
that was a bad idea!

327
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:04,527
Damn him!

328
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:05,737
[ENERU laughs]

329
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,197
Wasn't it beautiful?

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,157
Did you get to see
that pathetic little island

331
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,701
vanish from the sky?

332
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:13,536
I can only assume
that you are acquainted

333
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,622
with how forgiving I am,
especially to those

334
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,082
who would deceive me.

335
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,876
Girl, would you still
like a trip to Endless Vearth?

336
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,169
Not a chance!

337
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:23,171
Once I have finally
found the treasured relic

338
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,589
I've been searching for,

339
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,342
I will use another
devastating Raigo to annihilate

340
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,053
the rest of this abominable
island in the sky!

341
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:34,224
Then every inhabitant of Skypiea
will suffer my terrible wrath!

342
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,980
[ENERU] All will perish,
including the voices

343
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:42,982
directly beneath you.

344
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,526
Beneath us?

345
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:47,404
I will eradicate this
unnatural land in the sky

346
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,614
once and for all!

347
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:54,202
I will change everything back
to the way it was intended!

348
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,370
That...

349
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:59,207
...is my sacred duty
as Eneru Almighty!

350
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,299
I'm not gonna let that happen!

351
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:12,262
You won't get away with this!

352
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,685
[LUFFY yelling]

353
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,020
[ENERU laughs]

354
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:23,023
Your time ends now, rubber boy!

355
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,066
Die with dignity!

356
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,155
[NAMI]
Luffy!

357
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,614
[LUFFY growls]

358
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,658
[LUFFY yells]

359
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:37,620
Luffy!

360
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:42,751
Face it.

361
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,420
It's beyond anyone's
power to stop me now.

362
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,799
[LUFFY growls]

363
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,677
Eneru...!

364
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,221
[CRICKET] Listen, everything
will be all right.

365
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:57,599
I promise.
We will send you to the sky.

366
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:05,482
Luffy...

367
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,653
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna...

368
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:18,328
...ring that bell!

369
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

370
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

371
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

372
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

373
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

374
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

375
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

376
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

377
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

378
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

379
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

380
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

381
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

382
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,997
[ENERU] Did you see
the power of the Raigo?

383
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,583
Next are the Cumuloregalis
Clouds themselves!

384
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,335
[LUFFY] There's gotta
be something we can do!

385
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,086
[WYPER] It's important
that we, the inheritors

386
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,047
of Kalgara's wishes,
ring that bell!

387
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,965
[USOPP]
What? Knock over the beanstalk?

388
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,051
Am I our last line
of defense after all?

389
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,094
[NAMI]
Luffy! Promise me I'll survive!

390
00:23:58,178 --> 00:23:59,846
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

391
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,516
"Knock Over Giant Jack!
Last Hope for Escape!"

392
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,144
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
