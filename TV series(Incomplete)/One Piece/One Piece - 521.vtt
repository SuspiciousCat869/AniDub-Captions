WEBVTT

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.141
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.877
Smiling, even as he stood
upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.314
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:15.415
You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.487
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.389
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.459
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.256
[NARRATOR]
It's been two years

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:38.291
since the War of the
Best in Marineford.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.592
Scattered across the world,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.494
Luffy and his crew
underwent special training

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.163
to prepare for the trials ahead.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.498
Now, they return to the
Sabaody Archipelago

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.800
and move forward to next
stage of their journey:

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.569
The New World.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.742
[laughing]

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.280
We aren't getting ready
to take off, are we?

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.115
We're still missing
half the crew here!

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.385
I mean, did Luffy even make
it to the archipelago yet?

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:07.520
It's all under control!

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:08.721
[FAKE SANJI]
Captain!

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:09.722
Huh?

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:11.824
He's a "friend of the
crew," if you follow.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.026
Say hi.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.361
[RAYLEIGH]
In other words,

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:17.664
Luffy arrived earlier
this morning.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.500
I gave Sanji a baby Transponder
Snail when he stopped by,

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.801
so I'll tell him to come back.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.870
He should have Zoro
with him, too.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.838
Fine! You wanna fight me?

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.641
I trained these legs on the
shores of hell for two years!

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.310
[ZORO]
Then you better use them to run!

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.011
'Cause I will cut you in half!

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.914
[ZORO, SANJI yelling]

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:35.848
Good.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.318
We should hurry,
because any moment now,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.087
the Navy will be attacking
with a sizable force.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.058
Unfortunately, there's no way
to contact your captain.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.526
But if you follow
this Vivre card,

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.494
you should be able
to hunt him down.

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.097
Let's hope the fake Straw
Hats buy you a bit of time.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.832
[RAYLEIGH]
Grove 42 is on the outskirts,

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.601
so it's close to the sea.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.369
Take the Sunny there
and be ready to depart

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.104
on a moment's notice.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.873
I'm sure you'd like to relax
after these two difficult years,

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.675
but it wasn't meant to be.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.979
The winds of the New
World wait for no one.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.355
[LUFFY]
"The Battle is On!

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.724
Show Them What You
Got From Training!"

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.931
[RAYLEIGH] That should cover
the basics at least,

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.866
but read this before
you set out.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.534
I doubt the coating
will give you trouble,

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.536
but better safe than sorry.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.238
Thanks for the tips.
This should be fun.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.073
Do you guys think Luffy
grew a big beard,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:36.042
or big muscles, or something?

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.744
Oh, man, I bet he
looks cool now!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:39.279
I'm sure he does.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.115
Okay, enough talk!
Let's head to Grove 42!

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:45.151
Oh, right, guess I better give
Zoro and Sanji a call, then.

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.986
I'm worried, though.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.389
Knowing Luffy, he's
probably finding some way

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.090
to get into trouble as we speak.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.493
[gasps] It'll be our
trouble soon enough.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.095
This is gonna be another
wild ride, isn't it?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.930
[CHOPPER]
Ooh, I have an idea!

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.000
Let me go pick him up.
This'll be good, I promise!

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:02.302
[giggles]

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:03.836
[SOUL KING FANS yelling]

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.238
If you don't get out of our way,

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:07.140
we'll arrest every
last one of you!

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.408
I'd like to see you try!

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.177
Just let the man play his
rock n' roll damn it!

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.246
[EDITOR A] Hey, what's
going on over there?

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.014
It's outta control,
I'll tell you that much!

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.317
The Navy came to arrest
Soul King during his show

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.152
and now his fans are rioting!

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:21.187
Looks like he made
his escape, though.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:25.758
You skinless traitor!
I'm gonna make you pay!

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:26.859
[yells]

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.494
[REPORTER A] Anyway, that's
not the big story here.

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:31.464
Soul King is actually a pirate
known as the Humming Swordsman.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.700
He's one of the Straw Hats!

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:39.339
[BROOK laughing]

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:41.607
Thank you for the
ride, my friend.

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.810
And that was impeccable
timing, I must say!

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.945
You can thank Shakky for
puttin' all this together.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.314
Your friends should be waiting
for you at Grove 42.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.982
I'm so eager to see them again,

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.951
my heart is beating
out of my chest.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:55.288
Kidding. Obviously,
my chest is an empty void!

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.658
[BROOk laughing]

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.362
[ZORO, SANJI yelling]

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.368
Why are they even fighting?

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.737
I don't know, but both of
'em are strong as heck!

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.338
Still standing after all that?

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.973
Maybe you got
stronger after all.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.508
Yeah, and your
itty-bitty baby attacks

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.976
actually tickle a little now.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.378
Too bad they still
don't hurt as bad

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.079
as your food hurts my stomach.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.382
[BOTH]
Wanna fight about it?

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.183
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.451
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.654
[FRANKY]
So, here's the skinny, brother.

00:06:28.688 --> 00:06:31.157
Luffy's on the island,
somewhere,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.859
but the Navy's
about to close in,

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.495
and the rest of the crew
is headed to Grove 42.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:36.329
Meet us there.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.430
Roger that, Franky.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:38.197
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Cu-lick.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.098
What's up?

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.833
Great. You mean you
weren't listening?

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.869
Well, let's see.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:49.175
Navy, come here.
Us pirates, ship. Run away.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.376
Is that clear enough?

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.711
Why are you talking like that?!

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.679
Did you hit your
head or somethin'?

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:54.881
[SANJI sighs]

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.784
Sorry. I just thought I'd
speak on your level for once.

00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:58.951
[ZORO]
Huh?!

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:03.523
All right then. After this,
stupid cook die.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.857
Real funny.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:07.193
Anyway, you know what all the
racket over there's about?

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:08.261
[SANJI]
Huh?

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:10.129
[PIRATES yelling]

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:13.132
[SANJI]
You, right. Noisy, there.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:27.380
[PIRATES yelling]

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:35.121
[LUFFY] Wow. These guys
sure are worked up.

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:39.025
[FAKE LUFFY] All right, that's
enough yakking! Listen!

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.594
Turns out Sanji and Zoro
found one of the guys

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.262
who insulted me.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:46.599
In fact, he's here
with us right now!

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:48.634
Look at this little punk!

00:07:48.668 --> 00:07:51.938
I'm gonna beat a lesson into
him with my own two hands!

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:56.108
'Cause when you piss me off,
then things get ugly!

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.011
And let this be a lesson
to all of you, too.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:02.348
If you ever cross me,
if you ever disrespect me,

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.617
you're gonna end up
just like this chump!

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.853
Don't forget who's
the boss of this crew!

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.521
Is that perfectly clear?

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:10.122
[PIRATES yelling]

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.624
He earned that bounty somehow,

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.860
and it wasn't by
playing nicey-nice.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.495
What's with this guy?

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.798
Zoro, Sanji, he a friend
of yours or somethin'?

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.367
'Cause I don't
think he likes me.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.470
We've got you surrounded!
Nobody move an inch!

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.739
Straw Hat Luffy, you and
the rest of your crew

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:27.740
are under arrest!

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.408
Surrender immediately!

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:30.676
The Navy?

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.245
And don't bother
running away.

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:34.547
We've blocked off
every exit in Grove 46.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.414
You guys leave with us,

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:36.816
or you're gonna
leave in a body bag!

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.384
But my disguise is perfect.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.653
How did the Navy
know I was here?

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.089
What? Why would you think
this was about you?

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.157
Captain, please tell me
we're not all dead.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.026
Stop flippin' out.
We'll be just fine!

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:49.328
Why do you think we
recruited all these guys?

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.831
We've got pirates with
100 million bounties here!

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.165
But this is scary.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.767
Then sit back and watch!

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.068
Heh.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.570
Caribou, you're up!

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.907
Use that Marine as a shield and
make us a path outta this dump!

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.241
Wait, what Marine?

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.609
We sent a scout here earlier,

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.878
and it looks like he
was taken captive.

00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.179
Dammit, that's not good.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.180
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.516
I didn't quite catch
that one, boss,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.518
wanna run it by me again?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.619
[FAKE LUFFY]
Get with the program!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.389
I said use the captive as
a shield and get us out!

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.190
What an interesting idea.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.426
You want me to put
the poor sinner to use

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.461
while we still can?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.033
[CARIBOU laughing]

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:27.767
[MARINES gasp]

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.036
[chuckles]

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:35.074
[laughing]

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.309
[grunts]

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:38.144
[FAKE LUFFY] What the hell
are you doin', Caribou?

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.813
We need him to escape!
Did you even hear me?

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.381
[CARIBOU laughs]

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.383
Although that would be
terribly convenient,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.419
I'm afraid it simply won't do.

00:09:46.452 --> 00:09:47.486
[FAKE LUFFY]
Why not?

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.556
Because he told me he hadn't
called the Navy yet,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.426
and that makes him
a filthy little liar.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.428
[MARINES gasp]

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.830
Caribou, no!

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.231
[chuckles]

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:00.600

[MARINES gasp]

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.473
[FAKE LUFFY]
That crazy bastard!

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:10.076
Who's the captain here, damn it?

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.979
Oh, well. So much
for that plan.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.448
You high and mighty types
seem to think it's all right

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.317
to lie to someone if they're
a so-called "bad guy."

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.186
Well, I object to that.

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.021
[laughs]

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.623
I guess they're not
surrendering, huh?

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.625
Should've figured as much.

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.927
Charge! Show the
pirates no mercy!

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.629
[MARINES yelling]

00:10:29.662 --> 00:10:31.998
Good luck! Our boss
is Straw Hat Luffy.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.167
He's not gonna lose to a buncha
chumps like you! Let's go!

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.035
[PIRATES yelling]

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:39.639
[ALL yelling]

00:10:39.672 --> 00:10:41.540
If you've got a plan, I'd hurry!

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:44.043
Listen to your captain!
You guys're pissing me off!

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.845
That guy just said
that I was his boss,

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:48.014
but I've never even
seen him before.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:50.850
I do not have time to deal
with your nonsense right now.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.664
Aim for their captain
and charge!

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.533
I know you.

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:11.904
You're "Lip-Service" Doughty.
Your bounty's 88 million!

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:13.072
[chuckles]

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:15.808
You may be idiots, but at
least you're not cowards.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.877
Don't let him
intimidate you! Uh!

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.245
[ALBION yelling]

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.147
[ALL scream]

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.148
[ALBION chuckles]

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.282
Holy crap.

00:11:23.315 --> 00:11:27.953
He's got a bounty of 92 million.
That's "Gashed" Albion!

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:33.159
[MARINE S] We'll take them down!
Justice is on our side!

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.326
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.528
[laughs]

00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.830
The ground is soaked with
the blood of hypocrites.

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.533
Its overwhelming stench
makes me so sick.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.769
[MARINE K] A 210 million bounty,
"Wet-Haired" Caribou!

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:44.503
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.406
Too late to surrender now!

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.407
Uh!

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.342
Damn it, no one said he
had a Devil Fruit power!

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.877
[laughs]

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:54.246
Why don't we all
slow down a bit?

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.883
Haven't you heard that stress
can lead to an early grave?

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:00.119
[MARINE K]
My sword!

00:12:00.152 --> 00:12:01.387
[laughing]

--[gasps]
--[gunshot]

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.193
Those new recruits aren't half
bad. We got this in the bag!

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.261
I told you we'd be fine.

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.230
Hey, boys, I got a deal for ya!

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:14.100
Or rather, it's a contest to see
who can kill the most Marines

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.368
before they run away in terror!

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.038
Winner becomes my second mate!

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.706
Make those bastards bleed!

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.707
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.309
What d'you mean second mate?

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.044
Yeah, what about us?

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.880
I'd think of a way to make
myself useful if I were you.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:30.649
We've got some real heavy
hitters on the crew now!

00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:32.952
I might actually pull
this pirate thing off!

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.287
[FAKE LUFFY laughing]

00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:37.990

[FAKE LUFFY gasps]

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.992
What?

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.727
Pacifistas!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:42.828
Oh, hell.

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.602
[MARINES cheering]

00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.905
Nobody told me they
were gonna be here.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:53.839
[PIRATES scream]

00:12:53.873 --> 00:12:55.641
I kinda wanna beat up
those robot guys,

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:58.744
but Hancock said to stay outta
trouble, so I guess I won't.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.446
Those things'd
vaporize the mustache

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:02.782
off your stupid
face, you nutbag!

00:13:08.354 --> 00:13:11.657
Monkey D. Luffy has been
identified. Commence attack.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.926
Those things are
aiming straight at me!

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.029
Can I even run
or am I just dead?

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.799
I was hopin' I'd get to
rumble with them someday!

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:28.307
"Lip-Service" Doughty
identified and subdued.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.110
Sustained no damage.
Searching for next target.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.712
[PIRATES]
Captain Doughty!

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.614
[PIRATES scream]

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.951
Follow the Pacifistas! Capture
every pirate in your path!

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.186
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.453
Doughty's out cold!

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.355
A bounty like that and
these guys took him down

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:44.623
in only one shot?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.791
We're screwed.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.295
Hey, Captain, wait
for us! Dang it!

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.896
I ain't waiting for nobody!

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.999
That thing took out Doughty!
I don't stand a chance!

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.039
[PIRATE H]
Straw Hat, do something!

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.874
You're the only one
who can stop them now!

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:03.008
[PIRATES scream]

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.210
I hate to beg, Captain,

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:06.912
but your whole crew is about
to get blown up over here!

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:09.648
There's nowhere left to run!

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.418
Huh? Aw, crap, he's gone!

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.887
Where is Straw Hat?

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.556
They keep calling for
their captain, but...

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.758
Slow down, you guys.
My side is killing me!

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.528
Screw your side! The lasers
are gonna kill you!

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.831
Get your fat ass out of my way!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.567
Huh? Who is this idiot?

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.871
[FAKE LUFFY yelping]

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.739
He's here!

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.007
Captain Luffy!

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.577
[PIRATES cheering]

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:39.511

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.213
This is gonna be good!

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.948
You paying attention, Coribou?

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.416
[CORIBOU]
No, I was spacing out...

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.752
Over here, moron!
Who are you bowing to?

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:50.356
Get 'em, Captain Luffy!
Show 'em what you're made of!

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.257
Would you look at that?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.492
Guess we don't have
to die after all!

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:59.431
Am I mistaken, or did they
call you "Captain Luffy"?

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:00.699
Why wouldn't they call me that?

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.602
I mean, you realize who you're
talking to right now, don't you?

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:04.870
Go! Get outta my way

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.740
before I grab your intestines
and pull them out your ear!

00:15:07.773 --> 00:15:09.375
I'd run if I were you!

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.878
You're face-to-face with the son
of Dragon the Revolutionary!

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.781
That means I'm the grandson
of the hero Garp!

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.717
I stared down the three Admirals
in the War of the Best!

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.920
Oh, and my bounty?

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:24.523
It clocks in at 400
million berries! I'm--

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:29.161
You're not Straw Hat,
you human pile of garbage.

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:30.963
Not even close!

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:53.152
Am I mistaken, or did they just
call you "Captain Luffy"?

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:54.420
Why wouldn't they call me that?

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.256
I mean, you realize who you're
talking to right now, don't you?

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:58.557
Go! Get outta my way

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.427
before I grab your intestines
and pull them out your ear!

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.162
I'd run if I were you!

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:06.532
You're face-to-face with the son
of Dragon the Revolutionary!

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.401
That means I'm the grandson
of the hero Garp!

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:12.604
I stared down the three Admirals
in the War of the Best!

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.673
Oh, and my bounty?

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:18.210
It clocks in at 400
million berries! I'm--

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:22.881
You're not Straw Hat,
you human pile of garbage.

[MARINE N]
Huh?

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.620
[ALBION]
Huh?

[PIRATE O]
Uh?

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.624
[MARINES, PIRATES]
What?!

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.728
[PIRATE X] That guy just
took out Straw Hat!

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.864
So that's it. Fools.

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.699
They thought that they
could join the Straw Hats

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.801
and enter the New World.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.571
PX-5, who is this imposter?

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:52.211
[PX-5] Confirmed. He is
"Triple-Tongued" Demaro Black.

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:55.714
A pirate with a 26
million Berry bounty.

00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:59.251
Wait, if he's only worth
26 million, that means....

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.220
[PIRATES]
He's a fake?!

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:03.422

00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.993
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.661
It's bad enough that
this guy tricked us,

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.264
but now he got the
Navy called on us, too?!

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:14.633
Guess the real Straw
Hat is dead after all.

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:17.970
What the hell?! You mean Straw
Hat didn't get fat and gross?

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.305
This guy was just fat
and gross to begin with?

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.007
[LUFFY]
Wait, what?

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.643
That fat gross guy was
pretending to be me?

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:27.079
That Sanji and Zoro...
they looked real,

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:29.581
but I guess they
were fakes, too.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:33.085
Wow, this is blowin' my mind.
I gotta get out of here.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:34.820
[SENTOMARU] I know you
aren't real Straw Hats

00:17:34.853 --> 00:17:36.455
and you're just
victims of this fool,

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.923
but you're still pirates.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.793
That means the lot of you
are coming with us!

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.930
And although I
cannot imagine why,

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:48.200
the real Straw Hat is
here somewhere, too.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.535
When we entered the area,

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:53.038
PX-5 detected him on the
stage with the imposters.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:56.008
Fire on Straw Hat, PX-5!

[PIRATES screaming]

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.020
[LUFFY]
That was close!

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:12.191
[LUFFY] You almost blew
up my all my lunches!

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:14.326
What did food ever do to you?

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.327
[PIRATES Z]
Uh...

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.295
[MARINES]
Huh?

[CARIBOU chuckles]

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:24.069
It's... It's really
him, isn't it?

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.009
[PIRATES]
That's Straw Hat Luffy!

00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:34.012
[ALL yell]

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:37.149
The real Straw Hat was here
and we didn't even know?

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.317
Nothing has changed, men!

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.985
We came here to
capture Straw Hat

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:41.153
and that's what we're doing!

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.154
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:43.522
So there you are!

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:47.092
Agh! I had enough of you
the last time we fought!

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.660
I'm just tryin' to set sail!

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.729
I'm not supposed to
start any trouble!

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.264
[SENTOMARU]
Oh, it's no trouble,

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.266
but you won't be setting sail.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:57.836
Unlike two years ago, I'm an
official Navy officer now.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.340
That means I'm taking you in
if it's the last thing I do!

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:03.442
PX-5, fire!

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.217
Is that all?

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:17.289
What?

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.163
[LUFFY]
Second Gear.

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:32.104
You're way too slow.

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:43.482
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Jet Pistol!

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:54.760
This is worse than I thought.
He can use Haki now.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.934
[PIRATES] He beat a Pacifista!
And all it took was one punch!

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:09.441
[LUFFY laughs]

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.009
[LUFFY]
So long!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.912
Though I have a feeling I'm
gonna see you again somewhere!

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:15.414
[SENTOMARU]
Get back here and fight me!

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.149
Don't let him go, men! Hurry!

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.984
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:20:19.017 --> 00:20:20.953
[chuckling]

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.021
[ZORO]
Hey! Luffy!

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.755
[gasps]

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:25.524
Luffy! Shoulda known!

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:27.593
All I had to do was
follow the explosions

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:29.294
and I knew I'd find you!

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:31.263
Ah!

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.465
Okay, it's you for
real this time!

00:20:33.498 --> 00:20:36.335
This Zoro's not even
fat! Way to go!

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.203
Roronoa and Black Foot.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:39.938
I should've known
they were still alive.

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.207
All right, PX-7, attack!

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.242
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:20:49.982 --> 00:20:52.417
[SANJI, ZORO]
Get lost!

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:58.957
[ZORO]
I'm the one who got him.

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.293
Keep dreaming! My kick
broke his neck!

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:03.228
[PIRATES scream]

00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:06.164
It's the real Straw Hats!
They're monsters!

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:09.701
The fake ones were nothing
like this at all!

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.642
By the way, Luffy,
you're number nine.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.877
Nobody cares! Would
you give up on that?!

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.580
Everyone's waiting at the
Sunny. Let's get moving.

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:22.581
[LUFFY]
Got it!

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:27.419
We're not missing this chance!
Every last Marine, after them!

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:28.687
[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.091
Man, it's been forever, huh?
I bet everyone's so cool now!

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.726
I can't wait to see!

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.295
Ha! Uh.

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.404
What happened? Let's go!

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.072
[laughs]

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:49.341
Ah.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:53.845
[LUFFY]
Rayleigh!

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.214
It can't be.

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:58.216
[PIRATE Y]
That's Dark King Rayleigh!

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.920
[chuckles]

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:03.288
[RAYLEIGH]
I came to check on you,

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.425
but it seems you have
this under control.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:09.361
In fact, you're even stronger
than when I left you.

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:10.629
Uh-huh!

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.731
Finally time to
see your friends.

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:15.534
You've been waiting
for long enough.

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.703
Thanks, Rayleigh. For real.

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:20.439
You did so much for me
these past two years!

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:24.443
[RAYLEIGH] Ha-ha. No need
to get sappy on me. Just go.

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:31.416
[RAYLEIGH]
Hm?

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:35.587
[LUFFY]
One last thing.

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.157
[LUFFY]
I'm gonna do it.

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:46.765
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.967
You hear me?!

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.220
[chuckles]

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.163
[NARRATOR] After two long years
and one chaotic afternoon,

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:21.166
the Straw Hats are finally
ready to renew their voyage.

00:23:21.199 --> 00:23:24.035
However, before they can
set off to Fishman Island,

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.171
they must contend with
a massive Navy force

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:27.806
determined to stop them.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:29.841
Fortunately, they
returned to Sabaody

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:31.843
with some powerful friends.

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.545
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:37.382
"Everyone Together! Luffy,
Setting Out for the New World!"

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.818
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
