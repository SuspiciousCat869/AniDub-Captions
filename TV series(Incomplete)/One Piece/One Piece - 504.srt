1
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,122
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,859
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,427
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,430
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,965
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,768
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,436
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,372
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,242
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,877
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,411
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,482
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,018
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,555
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:11,758
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:16,463
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,269
[NARRATOR] The Navy triumphed
in the War of the Best

18
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:27,207
and Luffy, unable to save his
brother Ace, fell into despair.

19
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,609
But this is a story
from another time.

20
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,347
Ten years ago, in the East Blue,
when the brothers ran wild

21
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,182
with dreams of a world
full of adventure.

22
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,691
[LUFFY]
"To Live Up to the Promise!

23
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,560
Departures of Their Own!"

24
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,167
[NARRATOR] The World Noble's
visit to the Goa Kingdom

25
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,638
has come and gone,
but another visitor lingers.

26
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,773
At a small village
in the East Blue,

27
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,708
a group of aspiring swordsmen

28
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,778
chat about the
strange encounter.

29
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:11,117
[thudding]

30
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,592
Did you see that weird
guy with the big head?

31
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,961
Yeah, his face was
totally crazy, too!

32
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,663
[STUDENT A]
I bet he needs that giant ship

33
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,964
to fit his giant head!

34
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:28,302
580, 581,

35
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:33,707
582, 583...

36
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,543
...584... [grunts]

37
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,481
[IVANKOV]
You certainly kept me waiting!

38
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,718
What could possibly be
more important than me?

39
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,521
Sorry.

40
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,290
[gasps] Goodness... is that?

41
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,759
[REVOLUTIONARY B]
Someone get help!

42
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,993
[REVOLUTIONARY C]
This doesn't look good.

43
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,261
Let's prepare treatment!

44
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,229
[REVOLUTIONARY D]
Roger!

45
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,964
[REVOLUTIONARIES chattering]

46
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,032
Honestly!

47
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,102
What in the world have
you been up to all day?

48
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,670
[DRAGON]
I was watching the ceremony

49
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,706
they held for the World Noble.

50
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,441
[gasps]

51
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,176
One, that's some risky business

52
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,212
and two, why didn't you take me?

53
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,280
[DRAGON]
Because you would attract

54
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,616
too much attention, obviously.

55
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,617
[gasps]

56
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,818
[IVANKOV]
Could it be I'm too fabulous?

57
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,489
[DRAGON] At any rate,
we've tarried for long enough.

58
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,858
We've got business to attend to.

59
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,028
Do we have supplies?

60
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,229
The training hall at the village

61
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,264
gave us just enough
food for now.

62
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,799
Very well.

63
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,036
Set sail!

64
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,572
We're heading back to Baltigo!

65
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,717
[NARRATOR] A short time later,
in the nearby Goa Kingdom...

66
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,992
[MAN A]
Ah, finally, some junk!

67
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,996
[NARRATOR] Although the
fire razed Gray Terminal

68
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,765
and its people to the ground,

69
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,969
another sea of trash and another
sea of scavengers appeared.

70
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,809
[LUFFY]
You're in for it this time!

71
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,444
Here it goes!

72
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,413
Now, Gum-Gum...

73
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,916
...Pistol!

74
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,149
[gasps]

75
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,488
[LUFFY]
Heh.

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,491

79
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,497
Are you kidding me?

80
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,165
You still suck butt!

81
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,470
[ACE] It doesn't matter
how hard you punch

82
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,005
if you can't hit anything!

83
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,274
I told you, rubber's
a crappy power.

84
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,143
It's no good for fighting!

85
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,044
Shut up! You're dumb!

86
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,047
You're the dumb one!
I'm honest, that's all!

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,548
I'm trying to save
you from falling

88
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,051
on your stupid
rubber ass all day!

89
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,052
You're just jealous 'cause

90
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,988
you can't do awesome
stuff like me!

91
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,556
All you've got are jerk powers

92
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,426
and I'm working on all
kinds of cool moves!

93
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,728
Luffy! That was great!

94
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,832
Man, that punch of yours flies
further and further every day!

95
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:12,899
Come on!

96
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,801
If you go easy on him,
he'll get a big head!

97
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,137
I got stronger today

98
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,506
and I'm gonna be even
stronger tomorrow!

99
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,340
[BOTH]
Right, Sabo?

100
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:40,127
[LUFFY sighs] Sabo was a
nice brother, not like you.

101
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,930
You're trying to say it'd be
better if I'd died, aren't you?

102
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,832
I didn't say anything like that!

103
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,367
Yeah, but that's what
you meant, isn't it?

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,936
[LUFFY yells]

105
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,203
That's what I'm talkin' about,

106
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,972
Sabo would never
hit me, you jerk!

107
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:53,039
[ACE]
So, what?

108
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,941
[LUFFY] Be nice to your
brother! That's what!

109
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,343

Nuh-uh!

I'm hereby establishing

00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,873
Me, too!

116
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,249
[DADAN] What're you
little idiots up to now?

117
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,651
We need to be strong enough
to live on our own!

118
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,754
You're from the Dadan
Kingdom, by the way.

119
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,224
We still need to use
your bath, though.

I need your help!

We need help! Luffy got hurt!

Okay, wow.

143
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,610
It's a good thing you brought
him here when you did.

144
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,579
Also, if this cut
had been any deeper,

145
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,015
he probably would've
died on the spot.

146
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,187
I hate to say it, but this is
no good with only two of you.

[ACE crying]

148
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:25,125
It's all my fault.

149
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,293
I knew better.

150
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:27,994
Even if you're a captain,

151
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:32,032
fighting alone doesn't
make you any stronger.

152
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,634
I'm still no good.

00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,871

I'm sorry, Luffy.

Makino came to visit
and she brought booze!

to properly say "thank you"?

[ACE]
Mm-hm.

163

[MAKINO] And what's this
about "paying respects"?

00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:14,074
As a pirate and as
Luffy's big brother,

165
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,977
I need to pay my respects
to this Shanks guy.

166

Luffy says he owes
the man his life,

167
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,147

the least I can do.

Okay, I think I can
give you some tips.

It's a dine and dash!

00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:52,078
Oops! Yeah, you're right!

179
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:55,049
Huh?

180
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,184
[ACE, LUFFY]
Thank you for the meal, sir!

181
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,721
Ah! Keep your thanks. Are you
brats gonna pay me or what?

182
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,991
[LUFFY yelling]

183
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,027
I'm not losin' today! No way!

184
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,731
[yells, groans]

185
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,733
[ACE grunting]

186
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,169
[LUFFY groaning]

187
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,673
[BEAR snarling]

188
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,012
[BEAR growls]

189
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,313
[ACE, LUFFY grunt]

190
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,083
[ACE grunts]

191
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,519
[LUFFY yelling]

192
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,988
[ACE yelling]

193
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,893
[ACE, LUFFY grunt]

194
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,296
[BOTH]
All right!

195
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,132
[ACE]
Now for some bear meat stew!

196
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:10,757
[inaudible]

197
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,105
[inaudible]

198
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,133
[LUFFY]
Take care, Ace! See ya!

199
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:30,704
Yeah. See you soon!
Keep training hard!

200
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,939
Just gimme three years
and before you know it,

201
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,710
my wanted poster's gonna
be everywhere you go!

202
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,145
[ACE laughing]

203
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:45,352
Kick some ass! Bon voyage!

204
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,923
Don't catch a cold out there!

205
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,259
Look for me in the papers.
It won't take long, okay?

206
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,864
[NARRATOR] The world did not
know that the son of Gold Roger

207
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,565
had grown up in secret,

208
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,302
nor did they know that
he set sail that day,

209
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,870
determined to make
a name of his own.

210
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,509
[ACE chuckles]

211
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,055
[LUFFY laughs]
Guess that's it, huh?

212
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,126
Honestly! If Garp were here,
think of what he'd say.

213
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,079
[GARP] Gonna need you
to raise this baby for me!

214
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,949
[DADAN]
What? Why? Is it even yours?

215
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,918
So there you are, Boss!

216
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:56,022
Hey! Believe it
or not, Ace is gone!

217
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:56,990
[DADAN]
That so?

218
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,026
Well, one less
brat to worry about,

219
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,462
though I'm sure Garp'll
gimme hell for it.

220
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:04,231
Kid left and he's still
causin' me trouble.

221
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:05,833
Oh, I almost forgot,

222
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,034
there's a message he
asked us to give to you.

223
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,669
[DADAN]
Yeah, why should I care?

224
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:13,240
He probably just wants to tell
me my feet smell or somethin'.

225
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,943
[BANDIT A] He said, "thank
you for taking care of me."

226
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:20,948
[gasps, crying]

227
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,251
How could you do
that to me, you beast?

228
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,620
[BANDIT A]
What's wrong, Boss?

229
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,055
You're not crying, are you?

230
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,358
[DADAN] If you don't
shut up, I'll make you cry!

231
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,542
Three more years,
that's the rule.

232
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,277
Now, Gum-Gum...

233
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:52,346
...Pistol!

234
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,647
[gasps]

235
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:58,585
So close! I just
need a little more.

236
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,422
You almost got it now, Luffy.

237
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,592
Bend your legs a little
and aim straight ahead!

238
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,693
[LUFFY]
Heh.

239
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,566
Now, Gum-Gum... Pistol!

240
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,000
[LUFFY grunts]

241
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,439
[LUFFY chuckles]

242
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,408
[SABO chuckles]

243
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,411
[LUFFY grunts]

244
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,014
Gotta keep getting stronger!

245
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,985
Hang on, Ace!
I'm comin' for you!

246
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,227
[DOGRA]
Luffy!

247
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,161
[LUFFY]
Hm?

248
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,196
[DOGRA]
You gotta see the paper! Look!

249
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:43,997
Oh? What's up?

250
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,433
[DOGRA]
It's just like he said!

251
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,136
[LUFFY] Whoa, you're
right! Ace made the news!

252
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,371
He's got a ship and
a crew and everything!

253
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,474
Aw, man. I'm so jealous! Wow!

254
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,677
[LUFFY chuckles]

255
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,079
[LUFFY]
But I'm gonna do even better!

256
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,256
Hey, you guys!

257
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,693
I'm leaving now! You're not
gonna see me off? Hey!

258
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,428
[DADAN]
Use your head for once.

259
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,931
The mayor and Makino
wouldn't mind us stopping by,

260
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,334
but as for everyone else
in Windmill Village?

261
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,536
We'd probably scare
the pants right off 'em.

262
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,737
I dunno...

263
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,907
Ugh, don't make it
awkward, just go already!

264
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,643
Okay, well, goodbye, you guys.

265
00:18:29,677 --> 00:18:32,212
Thanks for everything.
I'm sure gonna miss you!

266
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,547
[BANDITS]
Aw, now don't say that,

267
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,149
you're gonna make us blush!

268
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,184
Well, bye. Take it easy!

269
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,554
Heh. I will!
You guys, too, okay?

270
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:42,856
Oh! One last thing!

271
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,058
[BANDITS]
Huh?

272
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,526
Dadan, I still think mountain
bandits are super lame!

273
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,562
[DADAN]
Shut up and leave, damn it!

274
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,099
But you guys, you're great!

275
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,469
[gasps, crying]

276
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,337
It's not enough to ruin my life,

277
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,974
now you gotta
break my heart, too?

278
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,375
You're awful, I tell ya!

279
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,311
All of you are good
for nothin'! [cries]

280
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:06,113
[LUFFY]
Sorry I made you cry.

281
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,748
[DADAN]
Shut up or I'll make you cry!

282
00:19:10,784 --> 00:19:13,520
[NARRATOR] Now, to Windmill
Village on Dawn Island

283
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,055
at the edge of the Goa Kingdom.

284
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,057
[MAN B] No offense,
but why don't you take

285
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,526
my old fishing boat
instead, Luffy?

286
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,095
That thing is gonna sink as
soon as you get out to sea!

287
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,665
That's too small, even for you!

288
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,166
I wanna start small,

289
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,936
but I'll get a real big
one soon, don't worry!

290
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:31,171
[laughs]

291
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,175
[LUFFY]
Sabo!

292
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,211
Here I go!

293
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:41,047
Watch out for me
out there, okay? [laughs]

294
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,719
[LUFFY] Sabo was first
and Ace was second.

295
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,457
I may be the last to go,
but I'm gonna be the best!

296
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,224
I'm comin' for you, Ace!

297
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,961
And all my special
moves work now, too!

298
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,429
Why are you talking to yourself?

299
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,666
Is this some kind of
pirate ritual I don't get?

300
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,133
No, it's a challenge!

301
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,702
To my brother, Ace!

302
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,103
Ace? Who is that?

303
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,371
[MAN E]
I dunno.

304
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,140
Okay! I'm goin' for real now!

305
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,782
[CROWD shouting]

306
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:18,819
I knew this day would come,
but I'm still a bit sad.

307
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,754
I'll sure miss him.

308
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:24,291
Sad is right, like the
world needs another pirate!

309
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:28,329
[sighs]

310
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:31,531
[LUFFY]
Perfect weather today! Lucky me!

311
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,971
[LUFFY chuckles]

312
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,473
[gasping]

313
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:44,044
[CROWD gasping]

314
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,412
Oh, no!

315
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,686
Hey, pal. It's been
a while, huh?

316
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,893
This won't play out
like last time.

317
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,331
I've been practicing this
move for ten whole years!

318
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,867
Now, Gum-Gum...

319
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,472
[roars]

320
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:15,175
...Pistol!

321
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:26,453
[SEA MONSTER groans]

322
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:31,391
Heh.

323
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,293
Been waitin' a long
time to do that.

324
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:39,866
[CROWD cheering]

325
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,101
[MAGRA, DADAN gasp]

326
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,871
He just... took out that
sea monster in one punch!

327
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,276
I gotta admit... I'm proud.

328
00:21:50,411 --> 00:21:52,613
[LUFFY]
First, I need a crew.

329
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,716
About ten people
should be enough.

330
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,886
After that, pirate flag!

331
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,756
All right! Let's get going!

332
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,459
Someday I'm gonna be...

333
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:11,431
[LUFFY]
...King of the Pirates!

334
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:23,611
[NARRATOR]
But time has not been kind,

335
00:22:23,644 --> 00:22:25,646
and after the death of Ace,

336
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,983
Luffy's optimism from that
day is nowhere in sight.

337
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:35,055
[LUFFY crying]

338
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,498
Please, Luffy...

339
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:50,704
Me? King of the Pirates?

340
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:52,772
What a joke!

341
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,176
[LUFFY]
Look at me.

342
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,779
[LUFFY]
I'm useless.

343
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,122
Ace!

344
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,458
I'm too weak!

345
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,900
[NARRATOR] Garp returns from the
war and visits Luffy's hometown,

346
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,936
only to receive a cold
welcome from Dadan.

347
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,139
Meanwhile, Luffy
is still inconsolable

348
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,507
after the death of his brother.

349
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,209
As Jinbei watches over him,

350
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,077
desperate to ease
his friend's suffering,

351
