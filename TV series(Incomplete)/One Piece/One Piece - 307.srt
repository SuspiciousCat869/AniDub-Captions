1
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,358
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:41,228
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,531
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:49,502
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,239
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,340
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,179
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,549
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,586
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:09,055
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,829
[groans]

13
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,732
[LUCCI] Finger Pistol!

14
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,136
Aaah!

15
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,203
[LUCCI grunts]

16
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,606
[yells]

17
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,473
Time to give up.

18
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,542
If you continue
these ridiculous attacks

19
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,144
I'll have to--

20
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,245
[grunts]

21
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,079
[LUFFY groans]

22
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,321
[LUFFY] Uh! Uh...!

23
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:44,792
I can't move!
Not good! Aw man!

24
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,595
I apologize,
but I've gotta kill you

25
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,631
in that stupid form. Now die!

26
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,035
[LUCCI] Finger Pistol! Spots!

27
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,405
[LUFFY] Change back, body!
Come on! Hurry up!

28
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,708
Or we're gonna die!

29
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,275
Uh--!

30
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,213
[LUCCI groans]

31
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,149
[LUCCI] That blow from
earlier damaged my legs.

32
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,119
Hey. It's changing.
I'm changing back!

33
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:16,056
[LUFFY grunting]

34
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,630
[LUFFY breathing heavily]

35
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,265
[grunts lowly]

36
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,567
[LUFFY] Ya see? It worked.

37
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,402
Looks like I
messed you up after all.

38
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,649
[SANJI] I've gotta
think of something!

39
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,285
If I don't, then we're
all gonna drown.

40
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:47,154
And we haven't even made sure
that Robin is safe yet!

41
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,256
[NAMI] It hurts too much.

42
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,094
Everything's starting to
go dark. Someone help.

43
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,830
[KOKORO] It's alright.
Just hang in there.

44
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,466
I'm not gonna let you die.

45
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,104
[ZORO]
What? What's going on?

46
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,207
It feels like
something's pulling me.

47
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,683
[SANJI] Uh!

48
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,787
Am I hallucinating?
That's gotta be it.

49
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:27,494
[SANJI] It's just like those old
tales that sailors talk about.

50
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,197
Just before they drown they
see an elegant tail fin.

51
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:37,771
[SANJI] They look up, surprised
to see long flowing hair.

52
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,442
I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

53
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,211
It's like she's
something out of a dream;

54
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,114
a legendary mermaid.

55
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:50,751
If I'm dying,
and this is just a dream,

56
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,785
then I don't wanna wake--

57
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,255
I'm swimmin' as fast
as this tail will let me!

58
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,323
None of you are gonna
die on my watch!

59
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,324
Ah...

60
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,725
Aaah...

61
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,328
Bah...

62
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,596
[BOTH] Aah...

63
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,831
Aaahhh!

64
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,366
[SANJI] She's the mermaid?

65
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,570
[laughing]

66
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,776
[LUFFY]
"Cannon Fire Sinks the Island!

67
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,144
Franky's Lamentation."

68
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:25,786
[MARINES yelling]

69
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,655
[FRANKY laughing]

70
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,728
[FRANKY chuckles]
[MARINES yelling]

71
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,064
[FRANKY] Sorry, boys.
But me and the Straw Hats

72
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,299
will be taking this boat.

73
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,734
Gotta escape somehow, ya know?

74
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,310
[FRANKY] And so,
after cleaning house a bit,

75
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,479
what was once an escort ship
is now our escape ship.

76
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,580
[ROBIN] Handy.

77
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,183
Now we wait. Once the others
get here, we'll split.

78
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,690
[gasps]

79
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,324
Huh?

80
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,497
What's that?

81
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,701
[KOKORO] Everyone! Breathe!

82
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,135
Uugh!

83
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,204
[KOKORO] Don't you die on me!

84
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,273
[FRANKY yells]

85
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,720
Sir! Battleships 6, 7,
and 8 have identified

86
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,655
and reported a large
number of pirates

87
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,057
located in front
of the Main Gate.

88
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,425
Mmm.

89
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,631
[KOKORO] Hey! All of you!
Wake up! Come on!

90
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,299
[FRANKY] Say something!

91
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,701
[GONBE, CHIMNEY, NAMI, SANJI,
ZORO, and USOPP retching]

92
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,036
[coughs]

93
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,371
[coughs]

94
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,672
[choking gasps]

95
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,073
Aaah...

96
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,507
Waaah...

97
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,811
[coughs]

98
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,414
[FRANKY] They made it!
They're all still alive!

99
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,783
It's a miracle!
I can't believe it.

100
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,318
They must've seen
something down there

101
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,287
[FRANKY] that put them
all in a state of shock.

102
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,289
Whatever it was,
it saved their lives.

103
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,723
If they hadn't passed out,
they would've swallowed

104
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,558
enough water to kill them.

105
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,127
[laughs]

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,629
Well, either way,
they're still alive.

107
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,300
Though it does make ya
wonder what they coulda

108
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,169
seen down there that
spooked them so much!

109
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,004
I bet it was you.

110
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,574
Huh?

111
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,477
Well, lookie there!

112
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,212
You're the one
that pirate king boy

113
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,715
wanted to rescue
so bad, aren'tcha?

114
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,784
[KOKORO] Yeah! I remember now!

115
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,153
We met at the Shift Station!

116
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,554
Mm.

117
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,790
You Staw Hats
are something else.

118
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:43,757
[KOKORO laughs]

119
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,093
Back then, I never would've
thought you guys

120
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,661
could pull off
a stunt like this!

121
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,630
If you don't hurry up and
put some damn clothes on,

122
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,165
I'll gouge my eyes out!

123
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,467
When he said he was gonna
be King of the Pirates,

124
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,436
I gotta admit, I laughed.

125
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,771
Our crewmate is counting on us!

126
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,807
We're leaving now!

127
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,609
But now, after
everything that's happened,

128
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,110
I bet he could actually do it!

129
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,213
[laughing]

130
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,182
[chuckles lightly]

131
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,517
[coughing]

132
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,053
[coughing]

133
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,288
[SANJI coughing]

134
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:17,091
Is--Is Nami okay?

135
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,261
As lively as ever.
You guys are tough.

136
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,696
Welcome to the
land of the living!

137
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,131
--[ZORO] Uh...
--[USOPP] Eh!

138
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,232
[yells]

139
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,402
It wasn't a nightmare!
Mermaids really don't exist!

140
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,336
[wails]

141
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,438
So all those old
sailor's stories are true!

142
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,773
"Every time you think
you see a mermaid,

143
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,408
it's actually a dugong!"

144
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,475
[SANJI] Shut up, you bastards!

145
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,745
She hasn't even confessed
to being a mermaid yet!

146
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,580
Stop trying to
kill my fantasies!

147
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,449
If you wanna be specific,
I'm an icefish mermaid.

148
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,452
[SANJI] Stop it!
Don't say another word!

149
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,587
There's no way!

150
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,622
What kind of mermaid
lives on dry land?

151
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,224
And has legs and feet?

152
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,825
[chuckles]

153
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,295
[SANJI]
I refuse to accept this!

154
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,762
[chuckles]

155
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,532
[SANJI] Mermaids
should be more like--

156
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,602
Mermaids should be more like--

157
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,171
[music begins]

158
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,507
[SANJI] Like what
all the sailors say!

159
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,411
A slender, sexy body.
Beautiful skin.

160
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:16,183
Long, flowing hair.
Graceful. Gorgeous!

161
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,752
[SANJI] He-heh.

162
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,489
[music slows to a stop]

163
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,325
[quavered exhale]

164
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:27,227
[laughing]

165
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,262
[SANJI sobbing]

166
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,598
It's not fair!

167
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,732
[sobbing continues]

168
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,568
Just to educate you boys,
when we mermaids get to be

169
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,438
about 30 years old,
our tail-fin forks in two

170
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,207
and we can walk on land
like a regular old human.

171
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,176
If you ever make it
out to Fishman Island,

172
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,644
[KOKORO] you'll see
what I'm talking about.

173
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,046
Their tails split?
Oh, I get it!

174
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,048
I heard the same thing
happens to a cat's tail

175
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,149
if they live to be a hundred!

176
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,718
Then they become goblins!

177
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,753
Ah! So she's a goblin-cat!

178
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:56,390
Don't lump mermaids
in with those monsters!

179
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,325
Enough about that!
Where are your manners?

180
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,328
Didn't I just save your lives?

181
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,163
[SANJI, ZORO, and USOPP]
Thank you, Granny Kokoro.

182
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,531
We appreciate it.

183
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,800
[KOKORO laughs]
Don't mention it!

184
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,782
[squeals]

185
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:31,658
[SANJI] Robin, my love!

186
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,328
Whoa, what happened?
Where am I?

187
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,531
[NAMI and CHOPPER] Robin!

188
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,332
[SANJI] Uh!

189
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,134
I'm so glad
we made it in time!

190
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,169
You're not hurt, are you?

191
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,704
Robin's back!

192
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,674
Yes. Because of all of you.

193
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,208
Thank you so much.

194
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,443
[NAMI and CHOPPER sobbing]

195
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,111
[NAMI] Don't mention it!

196
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:55,249
[sobbing continues]

197
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,251
Granny, you're amazing!

198
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,153
I never knew
you were a mermaid!

199
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,154
Nyah!

200
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,722
[CHIMNEY] I always did
think it was weird that

201
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:04,491
you had fins and scales!
Now I know why!

202
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,360
How many clues does it take?

203
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,628
Ugh!

204
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,330
Hey, what's wrong?

205
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,798
Are you all right?

206
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,434
I--

207
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,103
I can't move my body.

208
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,439
I'm not surprised.
Don't worry about it.

209
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,241
I'll explain
everything later, okay?

210
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,613
[USOPP] Hey! Zoro!

211
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,664
[USOPP exhales sharply]

212
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:47,334
Zoro! I mean, uh, Swordsman!

213
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,071
Over here. Take a look.

214
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,613
Hard to believe
that's the same island

215
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,381
we were on not long ago.

216
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,786
What's going on?
What's up with this attack?

217
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,154
It's like a sea
of flames out there!

218
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,827
I noticed something else.

219
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,729
It seems kind of like
they're trying to avoid

220
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,432
firing where Nico Robin's at.

221
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,667
[USOPP] That would
explain why this bridge

222
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,002
hasn't been blown to bits.

223
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,406
If they don't wanna kill her,

224
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,641
then they still intend
on getting her back.

225
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,744
After the Marines are done
attacking Enies Lobby,

226
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,646
they'll probably
come after us with some

227
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,682
hand to hand combat
to reclaim her.

228
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,250
[USOPP] I don't like
the sound of that!

229
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:37,384
We're at our limit here!

230
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,153
On top of that, those
battleships are bound to have

231
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,388
some pretty powerful
guys on board.

232
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,390
Where's Luffy right now?

233
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,593
From where I last saw him,
and what's left standing,

234
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:49,095
I'd say he's there. The
first tower of that bridge.

235
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,074
[FRANKY] He's fighting
that damn pigeon guy.

236
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,042
You know, Rob Lucci.

237
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,777
That's close by!
We should go help him!

238
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,713
No, don't bother.

239
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:09,149
That pigeon bastard he's
fighting is no ordinary man.

240
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,651
No good can come of it.

241
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,219
If we get caught
up in that mess,

242
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:13,787
who knows what'll happen.

243
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:23,063
[ZORO] Those battleships could
turn this way at any time.

244
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,433
We need to make sure we
still have an escape route.

245
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,236
he plan is to stay here
and wait for Luffy.

246
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,404
That's the best we can do.

247
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,153
This storm is just beginning.

248
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,587
Understood.

249
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,081
[chuckles]

250
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,150
That really messed up
your legs, didn't it?

251
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,651
[panting]

252
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,421
I see. So that
ridiculous fighting style

253
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,390
of yours isn't just fun and
games as it appears to be.

254
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,659
But don't underestimate
the strength and resilience

255
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,695
of a Six Powers Master.

256
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:30,764
In order for one to execute
such powerful techniques,

257
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,533
[LUCCI] their body
must be powerful enough

258
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:33,801
to sustain them.

259
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,102
None of that matters to me!

260
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,507
[LUCCI]
Tempest Kick Victory Bird!

261
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,708
[LUFFY] Uh!

262
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:08,134
Hey, Franky. Think your
friends are okay?

263
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,677
[laughs]

264
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,145
Are you serious?

265
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,214
Nothing can stop
the Franky Family!

266
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:23,416
Don't you worry.
I'm sure they got away.

267
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,720
[shaky exhale]

268
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,123
Damn it all.

269
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,025
[KIWI and MOZU gasp]

270
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,262
[exhales]

271
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,067
[ONIGUMO] All ships,
prepare to fire.

272
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,035
Huh? Is that a--?

273
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,106
[PAULIE grunts]

274
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,741
Hey! Paulie!
What are you doing?

275
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,714
[ZAMBAI] A transponder snail?

276
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,549
What the hell are
you gonna do with that?

277
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,052
We need to find out how
the Straw Hats are holding up!

278
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:35,322
[ALL gasp]

279
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,258
[RANDOM FRANKY 307A]
They're firing!

280
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,026
Big Bro!

281
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:45,632
[groaning]

282
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:06,754
Okay, she's ready!

283
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:08,422
We can leave anytime!

284
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,723
[NAMI] As soon as
Luffy gets here,

285
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,358
we'll set sail immediately!

286
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,792
[ZORO] Sounds good.

287
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,673
[SANJI] Since no one else
is saying it, I will.

288
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,675
Right now, there's about
as many battleships

289
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,210
out there as there are us.

290
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,646
No matter when we leave,
escaping from this place

291
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,215
is gonna be
virtually impossible.

292
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:36,784
[RANDOM MARINE 307A]
This is a report from

293
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,485
the Main Island Front Gate.

294
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,554
All personnel of
Enies Lobby have been

295
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,156
collected and accounted for.

296
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,191
We have also identified
about 50 pirates,

297
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,793
as well as the
mutinous giants,

298
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,428
attempting to
escape the island

299
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,330
through the front gate
here in the north-west.

300
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,131
[USOPP] It's them!

301
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,468
Zambai and the others!
What did I tell you?

302
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,370
Sounds like they're home free!

303
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:58,405
No need to worry
about that bunch!

304
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,341
Even with thousands
of marines after them,

305
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,809
they still won't die!

306
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,777
[laughing]

307
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,779
[FRANKY] I'm telling ya,
this one time those guys--

308
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,947
[RANDOM MARINE 307A]
We attacked them with a

309
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,250
full barrage of cannon fire.
They have been eliminated.

310
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:12,786
All targets are
currently presumed dead.

311
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,255
In the island's
current condition,

312
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:17,124
the chances of survival
are impossible. Repeat.

313
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,560
The number of survivors
on Enies Lobby is zero.

314
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,365
[RANDOM MARINE 307B] This is
a report from Battleship 2.

315
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,433
The courthouse
and the Tower of Law

316
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,136
located in the southeast
corner of the island,

317
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,305
as well as the underground
passage connecting

318
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,340
the Main Island to
the Bridge of Hesitation,

319
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,576
have all been destroyed.

320
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,145
The only remaining target
is the Bridge of Hesitation.

321
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,726
[USOPP] Franky.

322
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,696
They killed all of them.

323
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,800
Good. You head straight
for the courthouse.

324
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,503
The sooner that your crew can
get back together, the better.

325
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,771
That's what I say.

326
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:05,606
Meanwhile, we'll
split into two groups

327
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,641
and bring down the drawbridge.

328
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:10,344
The Franky Family,

329
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,446
and those shipwrights
from Galley-La.

330
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,682
When you see 'em,

331
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:19,086
[PAULIE] I want you to
pass on a message for me.

332
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,222
"You're all fired."

333
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,158
[USOPP] Oimo. Kashii.

334
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,095
[OIMO] You bastards.

335
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,097
How dare you.

336
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,399
[BOTH] Lie to us?

337
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,069
And Yokozuna.
I'm sure he was there,

338
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,704
right beside them.

339
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,072
[sighs]

340
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,674
So you up for
a fight, or what?

341
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:45,179
Gero!

342
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:49,083
And what about Sodom?
And Gommorah?

343
00:20:49,116 --> 00:20:51,118
They're dead, too?

344
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:56,290
[SODOM growling]

345
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:57,825
[CHOPPER] "I will
follow Big Bro Franky

346
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,427
until the day I die!" he says.

347
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:10,870
[SODOM groans]

348
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:13,040
[ZAMBAI] That mortar hit him
square in the chest!

349
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:15,042
He's about to go down!

350
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:16,644
You gotta keep
moving no matter what!

351
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,480
You're the only ones
who can do this!

352
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,149
He talked about it
like it was nothing.

353
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,752
How can they
kill people so easily?

354
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,820
[ROBIN] They don't
think of it that way.

355
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,156
They don't see any people.

356
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:32,326
To them, it's just a
tiny island on a map.

357
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,728
A place they've been sent
to erase from the world,

358
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,264
without any emotion.

359
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,799
[ROBIN] That's what
a Buster Call is.

360
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,811
[MOZU] Don't worry!
We'll save you no matter what!

361
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,580
[FRANKY FAMILY SILVERHAIR]
We're all going home together!

362
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,781
I promise!

363
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,324
[FRANKY] Hurry up, Straw Hat!
Your friends are all here!

364
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:06,594
They're waiting
for ya! Come on!

365
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:07,495
You hear me?

366
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,664
You better not die!
I won't accept it!

367
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:18,806
[USOPP] Franky.

368
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:29,049
♪

369
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:44,665
[LUFFY breathing heavy]

370
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,267
[LUFFY] This is gonna
be the last time.

371
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:52,106
[LUFFY] I won't stop until
I bring you down, you hear me?

372
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:55,042
Your body can't take this.
You'll kill yourself.

373
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:59,279
[LUFFY] Maybe. I guess there's
only one way to find out.

374
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,452
Now Second Gear!

375
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,696
[NAMI] 200 Captains
from Navy Headquarters?

376
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,798
Just how many crazy-strong
guys do they have

377
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,966
to send in after us?

378
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:22,202
[ZORO] That just shows how
scared they are. Listen up!

379
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,239
Stay your ground and hold them
off until Luffy gets here!

380
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:27,541
We're all gonna make
it out of here together!

381
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,543
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

382
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,414
"Wait for Luffy! Mortal Combat
on the Bridge of Hesitation!"

383
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:36,082
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
