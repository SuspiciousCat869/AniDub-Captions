00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.818
[cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.355
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.363
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.949
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:40.855
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.888 --> 00:02:46.132
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.236
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.877
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.814
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.847 --> 00:02:56.186
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.757
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:02.565
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.903
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:08.978
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.219
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:16.226
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.496
one of the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.702
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:21.971
Their current objective

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.208
is to destroy a man-made
Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:25.578
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.612 --> 00:03:27.414
Luffy had intended
to win a tournament

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.786
that promised the Flame-Flame
fruit to the champion,

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.160
but abandoned that plan when Law
was captured by Doflamingo.

00:03:33.193 --> 00:03:35.765
Now, he rushes to
the palace to save him.

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:38.638
You can leave all the
factory smashin' up to us!

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.508
All of you stay safe, okay?

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.610
Roger that!

00:03:41.643 --> 00:03:42.946
Roger that!

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.717
[LUFFY]
Traffy's life is at stake.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.987
Rebecca's wish is at stake.

00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:49.125
And he's the one
controlling it all.

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:51.496
We're gonna head
straight for the palace!

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.402
Then beat the hell
outta Doflamingo!

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:56.039
[NARRATOR]
While Luffy storms the palace,

00:03:56.072 --> 00:03:58.811
the final round begins
at the coliseum.

00:03:58.844 --> 00:04:00.948
Meanwhile, the Tontatta
carry out a plan

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:03.821
to put an end to Sugar's power.

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:07.060
[MARINE A] Cyborg Franky's down!
I think we're done here!

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:11.035
[FRANKY groans] Usopp.
I'm countin' on you, bro.

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:13.974
I know you're gonna start
that riot any second now.

00:04:14.007 --> 00:04:14.510
You got this!

00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:17.080
[groans]

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.387
I'm fine, Young Master.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.893
The enemy's barely even
conscious anymore.

00:04:22.926 --> 00:04:24.830
Usoland, wake up!

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:28.002
[groans]

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:31.276
Why don't you take this
poison grape of yours back?

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.413
[COTTON cries]
That's our only hope!

00:04:33.446 --> 00:04:36.452
The Tatababasco grape!

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.458
[SUGAR]
It's better if you eat it.

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:41.530
Drop dead, will you?

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:42.732
[USOPP grunts]

00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:50.748

[SUGAR screaming]

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:20.007
[LEO]
The moment that Sugar faints

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.377
is the moment when
every toy in the kingdom

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:25.618
regains their human
form at long last.

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:29.959
[LEO] The truth of this
land will be revealed.

00:05:29.993 --> 00:05:35.169
All of Doflamingo's evil will
be dragged out into the light!

00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:37.675
[KYROS]
How will Doflamingo respond?

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.913
How will the Navy respond?

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.219
[KYROS] What will the
people of this kingdom do

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:46.459
when their memories
return at last?

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:49.398
Will they be crushed by
the weight of their guilt?

00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:51.836
Or will they riot
in the streets?

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.676
[KYROS]
Or perhaps...

00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:59.786
[KYROS]
...they will fight beside us!
