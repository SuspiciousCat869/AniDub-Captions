1
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,524
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:41,395
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,698
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,669
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,072
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,173
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,543
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,812
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,249
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,486
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,688
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,305
[JABRA]
Just like I promised.

13
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:27,074
I'll kill you quickly.
There won't be any pain.

14
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,442
It's too bad, really.

15
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,477
You were so much better
off when you were connected

16
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,780
to that green-haired
shepherd over there.

17
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,448
This is the end!

18
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,719
Please, don't kill him!
Keep your key! We don't need it!

19
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,087
[JABRA]
And now it's over!

20
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,290
[ZORO and NAMI]
Usopp!

21
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,682
Who the hell are you?

22
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,271
I'm the hunter.

23
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,381
I'm-- I'm sorry, Sanji. I--

24
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,052
I tried.

25
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,687
But I couldn't--

26
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,489
You're alive,
that's what matters.

27
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,291
Everyone has things
that they can do

28
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,591
and things that they can't.

29
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,662
Yeah, but--

30
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,497
Both of you.

31
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,065
Take a look outside.

32
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,402
Oh, no.

33
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,356
It's the Gates of Justice.

34
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,457
They're starting to open!

35
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,494
Robin.

36
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,137
[SANJI] If those gates open up
and Robin goes through them,

37
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,206
we won't have any
way to follow her.

38
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,308
She'll cross waters
infested with Sea Kings,

39
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,645
and beyond that is either
the undersea prison

40
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,280
or Navy Headquarters.

41
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,414
Everywhere on the other side

42
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,617
of those gates is
beyond our reach.

43
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,452
We'll lose her forever.

44
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:55,122
[NAMI] But I thought Luffy would
have caught up to her by now.

45
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,757
Let's teach her
a lesson, Funkfreed.

46
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,596
[ROBIN]
Luffy is just up ahead!

47
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,000
But don't kill her. Understood?

48
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,439
Ivory Dart!

49
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,425
Idiot! You, will never escape!

50
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,661
Don't underestimate me!

51
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,629
Now come along, you wench,

52
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,432
through the gates of dreams.

53
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,067
[SANJI]
Leave this guy's key to me.

54
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,072
Changing my opponent, huh?

55
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,740
Doesn't matter to me.

56
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,146
For now, I'm gonna stay here
and do what you can't do.

57
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,515
You need to do what I can't do.

58
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,252
[SANJI]
Think carefully.

59
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,122
Read the situation!

60
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,056
As long as we have you,

61
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,759
there's still a chance
we can save Robin!

62
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,194
You hear me, Usopp?

63
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,365
I want to live!

64
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,070
[USOPP]
What I can do?

65
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:24,077
[LUFFY]

66
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:30,284
As long as you have me,

67
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,487
there's a chance
we can save Robin?

68
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,723
How? What are you talking about?

69
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,140
And Shave.

70
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,743
Get outta here!

71
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,645
Right. C'mon, Usopp!

72
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:58,779
Ow, geez,
I'm still injured, y'know?

73
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,780
Just suck it up!

74
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,249
Staying here and getting
killed will hurt more!

75
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,017
That's a pretty good point!

76
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:15,495
Iron Body Kenpo!

77
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,064
Wolf Repel!

78
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,250
I thought you're supposed
to be some kind of hunter.

79
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,318
Guess you're nothin' but talk.

80
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,460
Wait! Now I get it!

81
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:47,595
Get what?

82
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,096
We can save Robin.

83
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,699
As long as I'm here
we can save her, dammit!

84
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,833
Whoa, okay.

85
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,501
Do you really have to get
so carried away about it?

86
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,036
[USOPP]
C'mon, let's go!

87
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,137
[NAMI]
Hey, wait up!

88
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,740
[USOPP] I've got it, I've got
it, we can save her!

89
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,342
[NAMI]
Will you shut up?

90
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,110
That's not exactly something
we want the wolf to hear!

91
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,550
Looks like I'll get
to kill them after all.

92
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:42,082
Damn. Direct hit.
Well that pissed me off.

93
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,161
Ten Finger Pistol!

94
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,564
[SANJI]
Troisieme-- Hache!

95
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,466
[JABRA]
Iron Body!

96
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:15,349
Do you think I even felt that?

97
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,118
This punk's got
some serious kicks.

98
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,421
That technique you guys use

99
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,624
to make your
body strong as iron?

100
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,060
Yeah, it's a really
big pain in my ass.

101
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,094
Tempest Kick Lone Wolf!

102
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,071
Basses Cote! Longe!

103
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,005
Tendron!

104
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:41,708
Flanchet! Quasil!
Queue! Cuisseau! Jarret!

105
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,818
Veau Shot!

106
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,219
Iron Body Kenpo!

107
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,157
How many times have
I gotta tell you?

108
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,426
Your kicks do nothin' to me!

109
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,733
Now that's real power.

110
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,169
That was my Iron Body
Kenpo Wolf Fang Stance.

111
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,341
I'm the only master of
the Six Powers that can

112
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:17,611
move around freely while
using the Iron Body technique.

113
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,047
[SANJI] You're tellin
me this like I care.

114
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,282
Deuxieme Hache!

115
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,031
That should've done the trick,
but he could be faking.

116
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,504
Is he actually stayin' down?

117
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,179
Nicely done.

118
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,715
I've been waitin' for
a worthy opponent.

119
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,350
And I finally found him.

120
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,290
[JABRA] Now if you don't
mind me askin' a favor.

121
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:05,159
Save Robin for me.

122
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:06,293
[SANJI]
What?

123
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,561
What're you talkin' about?

124
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:12,098
[JABRA] Nobody knows
this, but Robin is--

125
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,537
This is difficult for me to say,

126
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,139
but she's my
long-lost little sister.

127
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,741
She's what?

128
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,510
I had no idea.

129
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,813
I mean-- She never
said anything about

130
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,582
having an older brother before.

131
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:34,755
I'm not surprised
but it's the truth.

132
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,490
It's been more than twenty years

133
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,359
since we were separated.

134
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:40,327
I'll never forget that day.

135
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,199
It happened on a small
island in the West Blue.

136
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,068
The weather was sunny
and warm that day.

137
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,170
Robin and I were
having so much fun

138
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:53,440
just spending the day
together on the beach.

139
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,209
Big brother!

140
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,745
My sister and I were
the best of friends.

141
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,181
So naturally,
we always played together.

142
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,184
Look what I made!

143
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,687
We couldn't have possibly
been happier that day.

144
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,789
Little did we know
what was waiting for us.

145
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,200
I turned my back and
looked away for one second.

146
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,241
When a pirate crew
kidnapped my sister

147
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,009
and took her from me.

148
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:37,484
Robin! Bring back my sister!

149
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:46,126
And that was the
last time I saw her.

150
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,530
By the time that she
finally managed to escape

151
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:51,098
from the pirates--

152
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,166
Robin.

153
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,701
She was already
wanted by the law.

154
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:02,276
I blame myself for all this.

155
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,278
And that's why I'll do anything

156
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,349
to make sure she's safe,
but I can't help her now.

157
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,317
I'm not strong enough.

158
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,552
So please.

159
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,587
I'm on my knees begging you.

160
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,590
You have to save Robin!

161
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:19,093
[SANJI]
Sure, I can do that.

162
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,561
Leave it to me.

163
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,162
I'll just pick up this key here,

164
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,130
and then I'll be
off to save her.

165
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,636
You really think
I'd buy that crap?

166
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,177
My darling Robin is your
long-lost little sister?

167
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,612
Dumbass.

168
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,548
I'll have to kick you
twice as hard for that one.

169
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,040
[SPANDAM] I've dragged you
far beyond the reach

170
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,608
of any help or hope

171
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,077
and yet you keep
on trying to escape.

172
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,280
You stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid woman!

173
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,316
I'm completely
exhausted thanks to you.

174
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:18,251
Now get up and walk
on your own, you cow!

175
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:23,190
You are just determined
to keep making me repeat this:

176
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,061
There isn't even a microscopic
residue of hope left for you.

177
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,195
Sure, we might've
heard what could've been

178
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:31,699
a voice earlier, but I haven't
seen anyone, have you?

179
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,334
If there was anyone back there,

180
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:36,136
Lucci is probably killing
them right about now.

181
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,338
Get it?

182
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:41,275
[laughs]

183
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,645
[coughs]

184
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:45,779
Look what you've done to me!

185
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,816
I'm so exhausted I can't
even cackle without coughing!

186
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,619
You stupid, stupid,
stupid woman!

187
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,420
You're ruining everything!

188
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,323
Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid woman!

189
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,325
Hasn't it sunk in yet?

190
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,527
You can fight as hard
as you possibly can,

191
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,297
but I am not going to
let you through those doors.

192
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,065
[LUFFY]
No. You're wrong.

193
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,234
'Cause no matter
how hard you fight,

194
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,336
I'm still gonna get past you!

195
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,639
I doubt that we'll
ever agree on this.

196
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,074
So there's no sense
in us discussing it.

197
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,510
And I don't have time
for talking anyway.

198
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,480
Gum-Gum Gatling!

199
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,114
Stamp! Whip!

200
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:23,416
Spear!

201
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,409
Am I finally starting to make
an impression on you, wolf?

202
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,644
Hey, that's my key!

203
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:54,148
Well yeah,
you did give it to me.

204
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,416
You bastard.

205
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,484
Still want a fight, huh?

206
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,420
Iron Body Kenpo!

207
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:06,293
[SANJI]
Later!

208
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,195
[JABRA]
Get back here!

209
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,597
I'm the one who's supposed

210
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,231
to trick people
around here, dammit!

211
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,200
How dare you mock me
and steal my gimmick!

212
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,201
Shave!

213
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,778
Party Table!

214
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,779
Iron Body Kenpo!

215
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,682
Cuisseau Shoot!

216
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,054
Brochette!

217
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,262
Damn twerp. Now I'm pissed off.

218
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:44,298
If you wanna get hurt
that bad, I'll oblige you.

219
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,600
And the easiest way to do that
is to reveal to you

220
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,636
the true power of
my Iron Body Kenpo.

221
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:55,008
Iron Body Kenpo
Wolf Plantain Stance!

222
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,347
Wolf Hunt High-Speed Scratch!

223
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,581
[SANJI]
Crap!

224
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,021
Heavy Wolf Paw!

225
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,602
How's that Iron Body Punch feel?

226
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,305
Probably gonna ache for the rest
of your short, pathetic life.

227
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,106
Moon Walk!

228
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:32,579
Tempest Kick! Lupus Fall!

229
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,229
That was a pretty stupid
move you made back there,

230
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:52,366
trying to steal my key and
run off while I'm still alive.

231
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,734
I'm a wolf, you dolt.

232
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,137
I won't stop chasing you
until you're in my jaws.

233
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,546
[JABRA]
Still hanging in there, huh?

234
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,148
[SANJI]
I'm not going anywhere, pal.

235
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,584
I'm not about to
get killed, either.

236
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,422
And I'm not gonna forgive you.

237
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,023
[JABRA]
Forgive me?

238
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,495
Upset with the way
we've treated Robin?

239
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:24,198
Gettin' all emotional
will only clutter up

240
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,833
your mind during a fight.

241
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,735
Don't waste all of your
precious time pitying

242
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:30,604
that hopeless fool of a
woman when you should be busy

243
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,574
trying to think up a way
to get out of here alive.

244
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,508
[SANJI]
Watch your damn mouth, wolf.

245
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,580
You don't wanna see me mad.

246
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,615
I tend to overheat when I'm mad.

247
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,217
[JABRA] You aren't
gonna win this battle

248
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,218
by tossin' around threats.

249
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,820
It's pretty obvious how
badly injured you are.

250
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,391
Though I'm more than happy
to put you out of your misery.

251
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:53,159
Iron Body Kenpo Devil Wolf!

252
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,744
Go ahead and laugh it up.

253
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,779
It's the last
chance you'll have.

254
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,259
I don't get the point of this.

255
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,261
You tryin' to make me
dizzy from watching you?

256
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,568
What happened?

257
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,770
Why's his foot
all red like that?

258
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,206
The foot of the devil.

259
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,542
Diable Jambe.

260
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,345
The heat I generated
from all that spinning

261
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:48,248
will burn my kicks
straight through you.

262
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,151
[JABRA]
It's glowing!

263
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,295
[SANJI]
Ow! It burns!

264
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,132
The heat of its
destructive power burns

265
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,400
hotter than the flames of hell.

266
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,052
Ow! Hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

267
00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm burning up!

268
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:28,555
Even my bones feel
like they're melting!

269
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,823
My Iron Body won't work!

270
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:33,093
How the hell could one
kick possibly do that?

271
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,401
Moron. You don't jump in the air

272
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,236
while you're fighting
a Six Powers Master.

273
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:48,074
Diable Jambe! Premiere Hache!

274
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,247
[JAMBRA]
Too bad! What a rookie mistake!

275
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,683
You got in a big hurry
to win and ya got sloppy.

276
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:59,653
So long, sucker!

277
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,088
Moonlight Ten Finger Pistol!

278
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,431
So you knocked one hand away.

279
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,066
Big deal!

280
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:14,068
If your other kick
could've landed in time,

281
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:16,637
you might've stopped my
Finger Pistol from hitting you.

282
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,306
Well I had no choice.

283
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,441
I had to get you close enough

284
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:23,643
to finish you off
with my last kick.

285
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,115
Diable Jambe!

286
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:30,184
Wait!

287
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:31,685
Flambage--

288
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,759
Shot!

289
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:53,273
God may have created food.

290
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:57,143
But the devil created spices.

291
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,116
If you think that kick was hot,

292
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,551
my heart was
burning even hotter.

293
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,128
[KAKU]
What are you talking about?

294
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,196
My attack has already begun!

295
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:16,796
[ZORO]
What?

296
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,265
[KAKU]
Giraffe Shower!

297
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:21,201
[ZORO]
There's too many of 'em. Damnit.

298
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,168
I can't block!

299
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:23,704
[KAKU] You're just beginning
to understand

300
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:27,207
the real, wild, destructive
strength of a giraffe.

301
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,311
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:
"Fierce Sword Attacks!

302
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:34,148
Zoro Vs. Kaku, Powerful
Sword Fighting Showdown!"

303
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,550
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
