174
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,658
[gasps]

175
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,427
Everyone!

176
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,329
Hide behind the rocks, quick!

177
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,029
How come?

178
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,199
[VIVI]
A sandstorm is coming!

179
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,834
[ACE]
Ah...

180
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,706
[LUFFY]
Whoa! Now that's cool!

181
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,910
Okay. Enough with
the sand already.

182
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,579
I'm not impressed anymore.

183
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,515
[VIVI] I should've
mentioned it earlier!

184
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,351
Sandstorms are another
of the desert's dangers!

185
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:42,622
[USOPP] You've gotta start
remembering this stuff!

186
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,640
[ACE]
Hm?

187
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,245
What the hell was that?

188
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,914
Can't a guy sleep in?

189
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,550
[USOPP coughing]

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,252
[USOPP]
Damn it, Luffy.

191
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,120
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji!

192
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,255
Let's have one of
those box lunches!

193
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,926
[SANJI]
Not yet. Not until Vivi says so.

194
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,327
Come on, Vivi, how 'bout it?

195
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,563
Lets eat! Doesn't
that sound good?

196
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,965
But we're not even a tenth
of the way to Yuba, Luffy,

197
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,434
and we have to make our
supplies last the whole way.

198
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,938
Don't be silly, Vivi. Haven't
you heard the old proverb?

199
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,006
"Make sure you eat
whenever you're hungry!"

200
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,442
Oh, quit makin' things
up, you big fat liar!

201
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,444
Okay, if you're that hungry,
I'll tell you what,

202
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,345
why don't we stop and eat

203
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,113
at the next group of
rocks we come to?

204
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,615
All right, rocks it is!

205
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,017
Onward to the next
group of rocks!

206
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,119
'Kay, guys, whoever wins
at rock‐paper‐scissors

207
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,487
has to carry everybody's stuff!

208
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,289
[USOPP]
Quit deciding things!

209
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,458
Don't you mean the
loser carries the stuff?

210
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,193
And ready... go!

211
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,095
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

212
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:56,762
[SANJI]
Wait!

213
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,030
[NAMI]
Now just hold on!

214
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,131
[ZORO]
Hey! You started late!

215
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,132
[LUFFY laughs]

216
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,167
[LUFFY]
I win!

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,602
[NAMI]
Idiot.

218
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,474
[LUFFY]
Heavy... So heavy...

219
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,312
[LUFFY]
Why am I doin' all the work?

220
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,147
[SANJI]
You said the winner carries all.

221
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,048
Now shut up and haul.

222
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,551
[NAMI] Make sure you
don't drop anything!

223
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,694
Hey, guys! I spotted
rocks, dead ahead!

224
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,129
You mean it?

225
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,332
It's lunch time! Let's eat!

226
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,035
Whoa! That's so fast!

227
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,512
[LUFFY]
Shade! It feels so good!

228
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,716
[groaning]

229
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,218
[LUFFY]
Hm?

230
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,029
[gasps]

231
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,538
Hey! Say something!

232
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,674
I'll go get you a doctor!

233
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,110
I need help!

234
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,378
[USOPP] That's weird.
Why is he coming back?

235
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,214
There's a whole flock of injured
birds here that can't move!

236
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,217
We need a doctor! Chopper!

237
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,720
[LUFFY]
All right! Let's go, Chopper!

238
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,388
[CHOPPER]
Coming!

239
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,390
[LUFFY]
We gotta help those birds!

240
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,191
What birds?

241
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,192
Wait a minute, Luffy,

242
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,761
those birds might not be
what you think they are!

243
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,797
[LUFFY]
Huh?

244
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,081
[LUFFY yells]

245
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,749
[ZORO]
All of our stuff is gone!

246
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,585
[NAMI]
We've been had!

247
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,786
But I saw them!

248
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,390
There was a whole flock of
dying birds lying right there!

249
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,594
I'm so sorry. I should've
mentioned this earlier.

250
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,597
Warusagi birds are desert
bandits that deceive travelers

251
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,399
and steal their belongings.

252
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,602
[LUFFY]
You've gotta be kidding!

253
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,840
You mean these birds play dead?
What a lousy buncha crooks!

254
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,341
[VIVI]
This is all my fault!

255
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,410
Those birds tricked me!

256
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,179
Luffy, you dolt, is that all
you have to say for yourself?

257
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,582
There were three days' worth
of supplies in those packs,

258
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,851
and you just had to go and
let a bunch of stupid birds

259
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,286
rob us blind in the
middle of a desert!

260
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,288
How are we supposed to
get across this wasteland

261
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,790
without food or water?

262
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,825
I hope you're proud of yourself!

263
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,295
Come on, it's not my fault.
I mean, they outsmarted me!

264
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,631
You mean you're
dumber than a bird?

265
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:46,832
What's that?

266
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,434
Knock it off, you two!

267
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,935
[SANJI]
No, you're not that smart!

268
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,771
Just save your energy.

269
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,174
At times like this, it's better
just to let them have it out.

270
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,942
[SANJI]
You're just a moron!

271
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,944
Fine with me.

272
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,146
Let's just take a break.

273
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,949
This heat is just startin' to
wear on everybody's nerves.

274
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,285
I'm sure we'll manage
food‐ and water‐wise.

275
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,887
It's nothin' that'll
kill us right away.

276
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,889
Let's put it out of
our minds for now.

277
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,023
Yeah, that's a good idea,

278
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,559
because when I think about
it, I get really thirsty.

279
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,162
[CHOPPER]
Mh‐hm.

280
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:21,200
[cawing]

281
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,471
‐‐[LUFFY yells]
‐‐[SANJI gasps]

282
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,176
Give us our stuff
back, you thieves!

283
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,677
[WARUSAGI BIRDS laughing]

284
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,246
No, Luffy! Don't chase them!

285
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,381
That idiot.

286
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,817
[NAMI] Wait! Will you be
able to find your way back?

287
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,520
[USOPP]
Get back here, you dope! Luffy!

288
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,722
[LUFFY panting]

289
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,593
[LUFFY] Stop! You can't
get away from me!

290
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,600
[LUFFY]
Get back here!

291
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,347
[LUFFY]
I said come back!

292
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,387
[LUFFY]
What is this?

293
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,644
What is this thing?

294
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,447
A mystery desert plant?

295
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,716
Man, that is so cool!

296
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,385
[grunting]

297
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,753
[LUFFY]
Huh?

298
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,394
[LUFFY]
What are you doing?

299
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,495
[LUFFY laughs]

300
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,897
[LUFFY]
That's funny!

301
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,666
Huh? You want me to help you?

302
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,736
'Kay, Gum‐Gum...

303
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,471
...Pistol!

304
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,510
[LUFFY laughs]

305
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,914
[LUFFY] Good thing you
didn't get eaten, huh?

306
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,649
Dammit, it those
stupid birds got away

307
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,785
while I was busy beatin' up
these mystery plants!

308
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,955
The desert sure is full
of strange creatures.

309
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,593
So, pal, how'd you manage
to get stuck out in the desert

310
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,361
all by yourself?

311
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,297
Hm? What's wrong?

312
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,302
[roaring]

313
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,872
Did you see somethin' out there?

314
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,791
[LUFFY]
What the heck is that?

315
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,036
Come on, Luffy. Hurry it up!

316
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,707
Um, you don't suppose he
could be lost, do you?

317
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,913
He has absolutely no
sense of direction,

318
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,381
but he's always running off.

319
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,316
And there are still so
many desert dangers

320
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,785
I haven't had a chance
to warn him about yet.

321
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,320
Not to mention the
moron was hungry,

322
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,123
so you know he's
not thinking straight.

323
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,295
That guy is so hopeless.

324
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,298
You can say that again.

325
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,000
[ACE]
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,937
I know my brother
can be a flake.

327
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,673
I apologize.

328
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,742
[USOPP]
Good luck finding him!

329
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,110
[SANJI]
Yeah.

330
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,747
[CHOPPER]
What's that?

331
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,821
What on earth is that rumbling?

[LUFFY laughing]

333
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,865

Is it another sandstorm?

00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,467
No, wait. That looks like‐‐

[USOPP gasps]

336
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,104
It's Luffy!

337
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,207
Oh, no. It can't be!

338
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,376
[NAMI]
Huh?

339
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,712
Why is he on a camel?

[BOTH screaming]

341
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,517
Someone wanna tell me what
the hell's chasing him?

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,551
I can't really tell,

343
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,386
but it looks like there's
something in the sand

344
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,221
burrowing after him!

347
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,004
What is that?

348
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,739
It's a Sandora Dragon!

349
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,506
[USOPP]
It's a what?

350
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,175
[VIVI]
A Sandora Dragon!

351
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,477
They're the biggest reptile
that lives in the desert!

352
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,079
They wait under the
sand for their prey,

353
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,380
and then ambush them!

354
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,248
They have razor sharp
fangs and claws,

355
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,084
but they hardly ever use them.

356
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,919
Because they're so
incredibly huge,

357
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,055
they usually just end up
swallowing their victims whole!

358
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,257
I gotta admit, that boy
does have a talent

359
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,059
for attracting trouble.

360
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,228
Right, and all of us have
the scars to prove it.

361
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,363
What kinda crap
star was he born under

362
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,265
to attract trouble like that?

363
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,368
[LUFFY] Stop, camel,
you're going too fast!

364
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,271
[ZORO]
Is he too much for you, Luffy?

365
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,539
[SANJI]
We'll lend a hand!

366
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,542
Thanks, guys! I brought home
a little somethin' for dinner!

367
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,443
Gum‐Gum...

368
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,245
‐‐[ZORO] Tatsu...
‐‐[SANJI] Epaule...

369
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,213
‐‐[LUFFY] ...Whip!
‐‐[ZORO] ...Maki!

370
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,447
[SANJI]
...Shoot!

371
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,518
[ALL gasp]

372
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,020
[roars]

373
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,190
You didn't have to go that far!

374
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,191
Whenever those guys fight,

375
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,394
it almost makes me feel
sorry for the monsters!

376
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

377
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:01,106
[USOPP, CHOPPER screaming]

378
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
Another one?

379
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,443
I'm sorry, I guess I must've
forgotten to mention

380
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,945
that Sandora Dragons
always hunt in pairs!

381
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,447
[USOPP, CHOPPER, NAMI]
Get with it!

382
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,049
[ACE]
Hm?

383
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,550
Ace!

384
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,484
Look out!

385
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,087
Lotta pests in these deserts.

386
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,622
You wanna play?

387
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,291
Well, all right,
if that's what you want.

388
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,412
This is convenient.

389
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,515
These rocks are just like
a natural frying pan.

390
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,351
[ZORO]
So, now that we have a moment,

391
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,253
what's the deal with the camel?

392
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,188
[LUFFY]
I dunno.

393
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,256
It was gettin' eaten
by the mystery plants

394
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,991
while I was chasin' those birds.

395
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,960
[NAMI]
It's obviously not a wild camel.

396
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,863
[VIVI] No, not with
a saddle and bridle.

397
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,033
[CHOPPER]
Uh?

398
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,106
Yeah! It is you!

399
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,645
[CHOPPER]
Really? Good for you!

400
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,547
Wait, so you guys
know each other?

401
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,515
[CHOPPER]
Uh‐huh!

402
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,018
He gave me a ride when
I escaped from Katorea!

403
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,986
[USOPP]
Hm?

404
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,521
He's a passenger‐carrying camel?

405
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,957
That's sure gonna
make things lots easier!

406
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,625
Yeah, that oughtta
be a real help.

407
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,327
It looks like he
could carry two.

408
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,029
Camels do go hand‐in‐hand
with deserts.

409
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,332
Great, I'll take
the first shift.

410
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,001
[LUFFY]
Ow!

411
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,337
"I'm a freedom‐loving,
hard‐boiled, yet compassionate,

412
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,304
son of the desert!

413
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,173
I'm very grateful to you
for having helped me

414
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,374
outta that jam back there,

415
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,076
and I'll be glad to give
some of you a ride,

416
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,478
but I'm afraid I don't accept
male passengers!"

417
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,047
[USOPP] Yeah, at least
give Chopper a ride!

418
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,351
[CHOPPER]
"I'm too macho!"

419
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,255
[USOPP] Why you! Why, I oughtta
punch you in the nu‐‐!

420
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,923
[NAMI]
I'm so sorry that my crewmates

421
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,558
are a bunch of ill‐bred louts!

422
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,193
Now, what should we call you,

423
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,995
you great big
precious camel, you?

424
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:03,428
[LUFFY]
Idiot!

425
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,162
[SANJI]
Moron!

426
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,364
[USOPP]
Doofus!

427
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,999
"Eyelash" it is then!

428
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,735
[ZORO]
Uh, how'd you arrive at that?

429
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,703
[NAMI]
Okay! Climb on, Vivi!

430
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,506
No, I'm fine. I can
still walk. Thanks.

431
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,108
Just get on.

432
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,242
[LUFFY]
Pervert camel!

433
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,079
[USOPP, SANJI, LUFFY]
Pervert camel! Pervert camel!

434
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,047
This is great.

435
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,682
We should be able to
make better time now!

436
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,684
We need to get to Yuba
as fast as we can

437
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,587
so we'll be able to talk
to the rebel army.

438
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,256
Giddyup, Eyelash!

439
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,958

Hey, wait for us!

Hurry up, guys!

00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,129
If you get separated, you'll
never leave the desert alive!

442
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:37,963
[USOPP]
Well, thanks a lot!

443
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,631
[SANJI]
I like this side of Nami too!

444
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,766
[ZORO]
What else is new?

445
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,034
[ACE]
After them! Hurry!

446
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,601
[ZORO]
Chopper! Hop on!

447
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,135
[CHOPPER]
Right!

448
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,537
