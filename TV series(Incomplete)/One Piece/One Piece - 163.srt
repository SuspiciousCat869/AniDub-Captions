[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:48,830
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:53,335
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

<i>I left behind those</i>

8

11
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:25,533

12
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,036

13

<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,088

<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,681
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:50,141
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,436
<i>For the horizon</i>

<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,816

Last time on One Piece,

00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,221

down their lost comrades,

31
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,349
{\an8}Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp
stumbled into the Lost Forest,

And as a reward
for good behavior,

several awards for. [laughs]

the Sky Knight readies his mount

to save Chopper, who stands
guard at the Going Merry

43

And I'm through playing
games with a fool.

string a bunch of
surprise clouds together.

Oh, you won't be for long!

the dragon is loaded
with explosive surprises

sphere somewhere on it's body,

83

it'll be over for you
and your friends.

00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,527
Correct.

115
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,529
It wouldn't be as much fun
if you didn't experience

the full power of
the Sphere Dragon!

117
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:19,619

The Upper Yard again, right?

126
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,199
And that's probably
Vearth in your bag.

127
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,828
[KAMAKIRI] Stay away
from that place, Aisa...

128

You can't tell me what to do!

130
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:14,382
You haven't even been
able to beat Eneru yet!

[KAMAKIRI grunts]

132
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,305
What a brat.

133
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:22,640
[BRAHAM]
An opportunity?

134
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:23,975
[WYPER]
That's right.

135
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,935
For some reason, Gan Fall
entered the Upper Yard,

136
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,480
which of course drew the
attention of the priests.

137
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,274
You see, that old bag of bones
thinks it's his responsibility

138
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:33,943
to protect the
people of Skypiea.

139
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,112
And that will only
make him weak.

140
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:40,116
[WYPER exhales]
We would be wise to strike

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,786
while our enemies are
occupied with each other!

142
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:50,919
{\an8}The Great Warrior Kalgara said,
"Light the fire of Shandora."

143
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,380
Our people will do just that.

144
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,215
No one can deny us our destiny,

145
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:59,594
be it Gan Fall and or Eneru, and
now is the time to take action!

146
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:01,805
They have had the
audacity to reign as "God"

147
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,264
and that is unforgivable.

148
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,600
No matter how different from
one another they may seem,

149
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,310
I assure you they are the same.

150
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,521
And they must be eliminated!

151
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:12,565
[LAKI]
Wyper.

152
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,900
Huh?

153
00:08:13,983 --> 00:08:17,028
It has been six years since
Eneru began his reign.

154
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,197
And for the first time
since he took power,

155
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,491
a rebel has appeared
on Angel Island.

156
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:23,451
A young woman, I hear.

157
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,453
Get to the point, Laki.

158
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,748
Because the Sky Knight rescued
the young rebel from judgment,

159
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,751
Eneru now has reason to
directly confront Gan Fall

160
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,795
in order to judge him.

161
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:36,297
A battle like this between the
former God and the current God

162
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,757
has never happened.

163
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:41,052
Strategically, this could be
most advantageous to us.

164
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:46,474
We must remember that Gan Fall
has never harmed any of us.

165
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,393
Not as the Sky Knight,

166
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:51,479
and not during his reign as God.

167
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,982
The fact that he never hurt
any of us doesn't change that

168
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:56,651
he ruled with absolute
authority as "God."

169
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,820
And although he is
our enemy's enemy,

170
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,031
that does not make him our ally.

171
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,324
If he and one of the priests
kill each other in battle,

172
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,910
that will serve our
purposes just fine.

173
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:08,496
Otherwise he is of no use to us.

174
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,293
If you have any doubts
at all about this fight,

175
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,253
stay out!

176
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,172
You'll just be in the way!

177
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:21,718
[AISA]
Hm?

178
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,012
--[BRAHAM] Aisa!
--[AISA gasps, groans]

179
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,347
Upper Yard? What Upper Yard?

180
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,516
I didn't go to Upper Yard,
I promise you I didn't!

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,810
You can't go into the tent yet.

182
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,273
Wyper, descendent of the
Great Warrior Kalgara,

183
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,025
is angry right now.

184
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,234
Careful.

185
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:43,490
Oh. He's scary when he gets mad.

186
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:47,994
[AISA]
Scarier than God.

187
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:56,711
[CONIS]
Help them? Us? How?

188
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,297
Conis. My dear child.

189
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,508
It's only right that
you and I should try

190
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,094
to create some way
for them to escape.

191
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:18,274
[BOTH grunting]

192
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,990
Wow, I can't believe
how fast they are.

193
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,242
Awesome.

194
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,912
[GAN FALL grunts]
I can see that diplomacy is

195
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,873
no longer an option for me.

196
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:36,751
[grunts] Diplomacy
is for the weak!

197
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:37,836
[grunts]

198
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,921
[BOTH grunting]

199
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,465
[CHOPPER]
This battle is intense.

200
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:43,633
[GAN FALL yells]

201
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,593
[SHURA yells]

202
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,305
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

203
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,224
[WOMAN A]
Heaven's judgment.

204
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,395
[MAN A] That young woman
did something foolish.

205
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,691
She brought this upon us.

206
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,235
She knows we're not
supposed to anger him!

207
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,784
[GAN FALL growls]

208
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,579
[SHURA grunts, yells]

209
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,206
[GAN FALL grunts, yells]

210
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,374
[FUZA squawks]

211
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,376
[groans]

212
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,047
[GAN FALL panting]

213
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,424
Please come back to us...

214
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:25,759
...God.

215
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:28,803
[GAN FALL pants, gasps]

216
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,221
[BOTH groan]

217
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:31,056
[gasps]

218
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,558
[BOTH groaning]

219
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,018
You're mine!

220
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:38,813
[FUZA screeches]

221
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:43,360
[SHURA laughs]
Is something wrong, Gan Fall?

222
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,196
Shura! What've you done?

223
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,239
[GAN FALL]
Why can't we move?

224
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,700
You old fool.

225
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,787
Time to die!

226
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,788
[GAN FALL gasps]

227
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:56,706
[gasps, screams]

228
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,541
[GAN FALL groans]

229
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:09,886
Mysterious... the strings are.

230
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,513
[gasps]

231
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:14,766
[SHURA] If you have the
audacity to enter Upper Yard,

232
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:17,560
you must answer to
the four priests.

233
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:21,231
You were foolish...
to think you could beat us.

234
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,150
[CHOPPER gasps]
He's falling! Oh, no!

235
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,822
[SHURA]
God Eneru is glorious,

236
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:32,200
perfect, and far
beyond your reach.

237
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:41,334
[GAN FALL] And our sacred land
will sing again someday.

238
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:44,045
Someday she must.

239
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,881
[CHOPPER]
Sky Knight! Sky Knight!

240
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,134
[CHOPPER screams]

241
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,306
[gasps]

242
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:15,118
[PIERRE screeches]

243
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:16,411
[CHOPPER]
I gotta save him.

244
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,038
I've just gotta save him!

245
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:20,790
He'll get eaten by skysharks
if I don't do something!

246
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,334
[FUZA squawks]

247
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,627
[SHURA]
Judgment has been made!

248
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:27,213
[CHOPPER] But how can I
save him? I can't swim!

249
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:30,383
And even if I could, the
skysharks would eat me, too!

250
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:36,222
[SHURA] He doesn't want us
to hurt any of his friends,

251
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:38,558
he's begging us to
not torch his ship,

252
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:42,187
and he says, of course,
that he doesn't want to die.

253
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,022
I'm at a loss here.

254
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,775
[groans] You're a greedy
little hairball, aren't you?

255
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,611
And you get under my skin.

256
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:50,779
Then...

257
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,906
...why don't you try
putting up a fight?!

258
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:55,116
Sky Knight...

259
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,036
[PIERRE squawking]

260
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:03,792
Pathetic Sky Knight.

261
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,253
You were God, now you're
nothing! Nothing!

262
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,047
Can't even defeat
a priest like me.

263
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,173
[CHOPPER screams]

264
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,634
I'll save you!

265
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,513
[PIERRE screeches]

266
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:19,474
[SHURA]
Ha! Ignorant little creature.

267
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:20,642
[FUZA squawks]

268
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,604
You're diving into
your own watery grave.

269
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:26,815
[CHOPPER groans]

270
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:29,734
[PIERRE squawking]

271
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:34,197
[SHURA] And now for the
Sky Knight's noble steed.

272
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,449
You no longer have a purpose.

273
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:41,579
Follow your master!

274
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,166
[PIERRE screeches]

275
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:48,753
[PIERRE groans]

276
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:51,297
[squawking]

277
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:53,008
[SHURA]
I do wish that I could be there

278
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,177
to watch the life drain
from your faces.

279
00:14:56,261 --> 00:15:00,348
But alas, I have other
matters to attend to.

280
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:06,604
Ah.

281
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:10,191
I wonder if the three fugitives
have been captured yet.

282
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,530
Could a well really be
that interesting?

283
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,407
[ROBIN]
Yes. Don't you think it's odd

284
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,243
that a well would be
stuck under a tree?

285
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:23,455
The balance between civilization
and nature here is off.

286
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:27,334
Well, unless we find a way
to cross this cloud river,

287
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,419
we'll be stuck in this forest.

288
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,300
[ZORO] And we're still nowhere
near where we wanna be.

289
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:36,676
[ROBIN] It's like the
people who built this

290
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,262
didn't know the tree
would grow to be so large.

291
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,723
I've never seen
anything like it.

292
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,224
[ZORO]
Hey, Nami!

293
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,393
Can you see anything up there?

294
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,692
[NAMI]
The island where God lives...

295
00:15:52,776 --> 00:15:54,277
Upper Yard.

296
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:59,908
[ZORO]
Nami! Say somethin', would ya?

297
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:00,867
What do you see?

298
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,452
Hey, can you hear me?

299
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:06,081
What do you think
she sees up there?

300
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:08,625
[NAMI gasps]

301
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:13,380
This island... can't be...

302
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:18,843
[SATORI laughing]

303
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,512
[SATORI]
There's no way you can win!

304
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:24,349
After all, I'm a priest,
and you all look so tired.

305
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:27,894
Why don't you just end
this now and die? [laughs]

306
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,854
My heart can't take
anymore of this.

307
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,231
Too many surprises.

308
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,108
Ow, it hurts.

309
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:35,694
You'll be out of
options quite soon.

310
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:38,571
It's sad really.

311
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,491
Your little boat has nearly
reached the forest's exit

312
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:45,578
and when that happens,
it's all over for you! [laughs]

313
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,540
You'll have nowhere to go

314
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:52,168
unless, of course,
you suddenly learn to fly!

315
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:56,047
[LUFFY panting]

316
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,050
[SATORI] You'll wander around in
this terribly unfamiliar forest

317
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:04,180
and die of exhaustion! [laughs]

318
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:05,765
[LUFFY]
That won't...

319
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,599
Hm?

320
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:07,851
...happen!

321
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,270
[SATORI]
Ha! Nice try!

322
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:11,938
My turn now!

323
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,606
[LUFFY gasps]

324
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,191
[SATORI]
Sphere Dragon attack!

325
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,318
You know you can't run forever.

326
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:18,862
And wherever you stop,

327
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:22,407
the fire-bomb ball will be
waiting to incinerate you!

328
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,867
[SATORI laughs]

329
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,660
[LUFFY panting]

330
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,496
[laughs]

331
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,751
[USOPP] Good, looks like
we can still make it.

332
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,627
I'll just leave things
here with you, Luffy!

333
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,964
[LUFFY yelling]

334
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:42,594
That tree... will not
give you any shelter.

335
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,137
[LUFFY]
It's like he's reading my mind!

336
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,599
Stay outta my head
and quit following me!

337
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,059
[LUFFY grunts]

338
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:50,685
[SATORI]
What are you doing?

339
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,064
[LUFFY grunts]
A wire! What the--?

340
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:57,776
Wait, this must be how
he controls the dragon!

341
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:58,735
I'll just...

342
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,070
No, stop!

343
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,613
...do this!

344
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:05,200
[gasps] You ruined
my Sphere Dragon,

345
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,035
you impudent little brat!

346
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:08,536
Now you die!

347
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,747
Get over here this
instance! [grunts]

348
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,959
[yelling]

349
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:16,711
[SATORI gasps]

350
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,547
Let go of the dragon, you fool!

351
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:25,095
[SATORI screaming]

352
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,908
[USOPP]
There it is!

353
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,284
Yeah, I was right!

354
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:50,912
I knew I could find the
way out of this place!

355
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:53,039
Of course! This makes
perfect sense.

356
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:54,958
Why didn't I think
of this sooner?

357
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,253
When we fell before, it was
from a very high altitude.

358
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,214
So it's only natural that the
exit be at the same height.

359
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,841
And now that I know
where the exit is,

360
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:06,011
the boat doesn't
really matter anymore.

361
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,387
All right.

362
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,431
That huge explosion
worries me. I'd better hurry.

363
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,724
Game time.

364
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,600
[USOPP]
Ow!

365
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:18,565
[SATORI panting]

366
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,025
That was close!

367
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,235
That maniac must've
had a death wish!

368
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:24,779
This isn't good. [pants]

369
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,615
I've got to intensify
my training.

370
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,828
I can't let a weakling like him
get the upperhand in a fight!

371
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,414
Not even for a second!

372
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:37,792
That might block me
from using my Mantra!

373
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:38,668
[LUFFY]
You're right!

374
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:39,711
[SATORI gasps]

375
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:42,047
That was close!

376
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,632
It's you! How are
you still alive?

377
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,468
--[LUFFY chuckles]
--[SATORI screams]

378
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,094
[SATORI]
Get off me!

379
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:49,971
You horrible little man!

380
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,598
I'll get you for this!

381
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,017
Let go of me right now!

382
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,020
[SANJI]
Do not let him go, Luffy.

383
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:00,148
You, too?

384
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,108
Hey, Sanji, where've you been?

385
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,486
I was out cold on
the forest floor!

386
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,280
Where else would I
have been, you idiot?!

387
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,699
But... that's beside the point.

388
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,080
[SANJI]
See, the point is

389
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,791
that you keep saying challenge
this and challenge that,

390
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,959
which normally
wouldn't interest me.

391
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:21,795
However, there are
two helpless ladies

392
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:23,797
waiting for me to
come to their rescue,

393
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,633
and I refuse to let them down.

394
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,511
So I'm proposing this.

395
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,429
And I think you'll like it.

396
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,600
Ordeal of love.

397
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,769
[SATORI]
This guy's an idiot, too!

398
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,146
Unhand me this instant,
you maggots!

399
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,607
[SATORI yelling]

400
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,192
It's just not fair!

401
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:47,654
You have no honor,
ganging up two against one!

402
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,699
[SANJI]
We have no honor?

403
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,245
You creeps kidnapped our friends

404
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,789
and tried to murder a
beautiful young angel.

405
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,834
And you accuse us of
not having any honor?

406
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:01,960
[SATORI whimpers]

407
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,420
I've been thinking.

408
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,463
It's pretty amazing that you
can predict our movements.

409
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,674
But what good is that...

410
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:11,094
...if you do can't anything
to avoid 'em, huh? [chuckles]

411
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,679
[SATORI screams]

412
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,431
[SATORI]
Stop! Stop, I said!

413
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:15,640
Are you listening?

414
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:17,475
How dare you disobey me!

415
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:19,602
I'm a priest in God's service!

416
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:23,523
Not being judged by me is a
first-degree crime in Skypiea!

417
00:21:23,606 --> 00:21:24,607
Let me go!

418
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:26,192
Now listen here!

419
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:30,405
Attacking me means you declare
war on the Almighty God Eneru!

420
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:31,781
I got a question.

421
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,992
Do you ever cook?

422
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:36,161
Well, you don't have
to be a chef to know

423
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:39,330
which dish is best served cold.

424
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:41,583
[SATORI screams]

425
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,210
You know, this dish is
really quite simple.

426
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:45,587
Step one:

427
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,715
season the main course
with a smattering of defeat.

428
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,259
[SANJI grunts]

429
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,513
Then, you must brutally
and without hesitation

430
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:56,848
tenderize the meat.

431
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,017
[SATORI screams]
No! You can't do this!

432
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,685
No!

433
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:05,607
No! Please! No, don't hurt me!

434
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,609
[SATORI screams]

435
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,278
[SANJI]
Delicious!

436
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:16,368
[yelling]

437
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:38,848
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

438
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:45,313
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

439
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,233
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

440
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,985
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

441
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,864
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

442
00:22:54,948 --> 00:22:59,911
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

443
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,832
<i>We will never yield</i>

444
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,709
<i>We won't back down</i>

445
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:09,004
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

446
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

447
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,972
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

448
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:22,392
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

449
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:30,275
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

450
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,456
[LUFFY]
All in a day's work!

451
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,790
What's the next ordeal?

452
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:47,125
[SANJI]
After an ordeal of love

453
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,169
comes an ordeal
of romance! Ladies!

454
00:23:49,252 --> 00:23:50,378
[NAMI]
C'mon, follow me!

455
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,547
We have to get to
the shore somehow!

456
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,549
[ZORO] Things are startin'
to look like trouble!

457
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:55,967
[WYPER]
Now is our chance!

458
00:23:56,051 --> 00:23:59,304
Today we crush the priests
and take back Upper Yard!

459
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,056
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

460
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,559
"Light the Fire of Shandora!
Wyper, the Warrior!"

461
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:07,062
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
