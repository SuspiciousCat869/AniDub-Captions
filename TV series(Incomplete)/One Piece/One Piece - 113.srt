Ow...

177
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,613
Ah! He has to wake up now?

178
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,116
[CHOPPER] He survived being
hit by a five‐ton hammer?

179
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,084
What kind of monster is he?

180
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,653
[MISS MERRY CHRISTMAS] Yeah.
He doesn't even have a bump

181
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,321
on his head.

182
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,124
He took a direct blow to the
head from a five‐ton hammer

183
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,760
and he's okay? Why is that?

184

[LASSOO sneezes]

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,672
[CHOPPER]
You mean that thing was a fake?

188
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,273
This whole time?

189
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,775
Of course it was!

190
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,777
You think I can
really lift five tons?

191
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,112
I stop trying after
just 10 pounds!

192
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,847
This is a model I made.

193
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,016
It's only a couple of
frying pans tied to a stick

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,318
and covered with paper.

[MISS MERRY CHRISTMAS]
Why, you...

197
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,028
You tricked me with
a piece of paper?

198
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,363
No more mercy for you!

She's gone underground
into the mole tunnels again.

202

Watch out for
the holes, Chopper!

203
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,111

What's she planning this time?

204
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,992
[USOPP]
Where are you, mole‐thing?

205
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,060
Where did you go?

Watch out for the holes,
did you say?

00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,367
[laughs]
That won't do you any good!

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,068
Moving around underground
is just like

210
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,870
swimming in a pool to me.

211
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,705
You can't escape this time!

It's no use.

There's no way I can
handle an attack like this.

It's all or nothing now.

226
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,249
I have to think up
a way to beat this guy,

before he kills us both!

You can't win like that.

If I keep running at this
speed and she follows me,

she'll run into the part of
the wall that's under the sand!

really hard, too!

that to finish him.

weakness comes first.

Otherwise, we are
going to die here.

And that's the

[USOPP panting]

00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,259
[CHOPPER]
Usopp!

353
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,127
[MISS MERRY CHRISTMAS] The Blue
nose is right, you know.

354
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,129
[USOPP yells]

355
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,099
[MISS MERRY CHRISTMAS] That was
quite a little stunt you pulled!

356
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,300
After doing something like that,

357
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,701
we're not gonna just
let you run away

358
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,603
like nothing happened.

359
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,205
Oh, no! Usopp!

360
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:18,277
[USOPP yelling]

361
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,212
Well, I guess with a
captain who's so pathetic,

362
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,714
it's no surprise that the
rest of the crew's useless.

363
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,721
[USOPP]
Captain? Wait.

364
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,524
Are you‐‐
Are you talking about Luffy?

365
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,226
If you're talking
about the Straw Hat kid,

366
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,528
that idiot was killed a little
while ago by the boss.

367
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,163
What a shocker.

368
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,566
And now the rebellion has
started and is well under way.

369
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,568
Well. I guess you
picked the wrong people

370
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
to mess with.

371
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,379
She said Luffy is dead?

372
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,185

Luffy's been killed?

[USOPP] Quit lying to us,
you freaky mole‐woman.

388
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,902
Luffy... Luffy can't be dead!

Usopp!

390
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,839
[SANJI] Ha! You're really
getting annoying, ballerina boy.

391
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,808

changes a bit?
