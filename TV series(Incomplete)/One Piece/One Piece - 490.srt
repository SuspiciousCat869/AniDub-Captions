[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,193
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

in search of the One Piece,

00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:43,764
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,298
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,101
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,770
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,706
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,576
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,211
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,745
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,182

necessary to stop them.

awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:16,663

the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,768
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of the Straw Hat crew,

18
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,171
Luffy struggled in vain
to rescue his brother

19
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,207
from execution at the
hands of the Navy.

20
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,011
In the end, both Ace and
the legendary pirate Whitebeard,

21
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,281
lost their lives
in the conflict.

22
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,784
As for Whitebeard and Ace,

23
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,652

object to their friends

00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,625
I'll allow it, Shanks,
just this once.

Back at Marineford

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,603
and far away from celebrations
of the Navy victory,

84
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,905
there are seven ships afloat.

85
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,041
Those who will soon take
part in the new pirate era

00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,579
are witnessing one of the
great turning points in history.

Ever mindful of the Navy's
ruthless sense of justice,

00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:58,051
they still stare upon
the aftermath of war,

89
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,786
knowing the ensuing chaos will

90
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,758
leave plenty of opportunity
for new powers to arise.

At last the war's over.

93
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,834
Both sides are weakened,
Navy and the pirates...

94
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,836
It's just a matter of time.

95
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,471
Whitebeard's territory--

96
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,940
Other pirates will
be vyin' for control.

97
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,875
It's bound to get pretty rough.

98
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,979
Now Blackbeard's
reign has begun.

99
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,047
Not only has he built
a formidable crew,

100
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,550
but he's got two
Devil Fruit powers.

101
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,452
Just our luck.
It's gonna be a while

102

before we've got the strength
to topple those guys!

103
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,927
It's all his fault.

What are you talkin' about,

Trafalgar Law is
no friend of Straw Hat.

Why is he saving him now?
What's the catch?

Huh?

112
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,949
Law has got a reputation.

113
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,185
He's one of the North Blue's
most brutal pirates.

114
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,854
There's no way he'd've saved him

something back in return.

worked up at first.

00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:49,216
most people failed to consider
the war's real consequences.

175
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,585

[CROWD murmuring]

177
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,757

You're all fools!

Didn't you hear him?

179
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,894
The One Piece--
Whitebeard said it's real!

180
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,531
So, Gold Roger
wasn't lying after all!

181
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,766
Well, guess we better
get to finding it!

182
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,968

Yeah!

[gunshots]

184
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:13,974
Enough wasting away in
this dump! Time to set sail!

00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:17,878
[PIRATES]
Yeah!

186
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:22,282
[NARRATOR] Though "Navy victory"
might have a nice ring to it,

187
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:26,052
it does not necessarily
equate to peace.

188
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,393
[MAN X gasps]
You guys aren't welcome here!

189
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,829
Get out of our town!

190
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:39,233
[NARRATOR]
For Whitebeard was a pirate,

191
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,535
but he was also a protector,

192
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,204
and news of his death
emboldened pirates

193
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,606
who previously cowered from him.

[BRANNEW panting]

197
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,531
I'm very sorry for
the intrusion, sir,

198
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,934
but we've just received
urgent news from Impel Down!

199
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,168
Should I continue, sir?

200
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,471
Magellan, is he all right?

201
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,173
[BRANNEW] He was beaten
badly and is barely alive.

202
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,611
The medical team has been
working on his injuries nonstop,

203
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,279
but Magellan is ashamed

204
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,115
and he's blaming himself
for what happened down there.

205
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:30,016
If his wounds weren't so severe,

206
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,319
then he'd probably be
at risk of killing himself.

207
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,288
Don't tell me that nonsense!
He knows how much we need him!

208
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,557
Uhh, yes, sir! Of course.

209
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,628
What exactly did
happen at Impel Down?

210
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,797
Things there are
quite disastrous.

211
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,336
The situation on Level 6 is
especially dire. It's a crisis.

212
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,038
Elaborate.

Feelin' a bit down,

217

thinkin' you'll be stuck
in this hellhole forever?

00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,230
Just waitin' till ya die, huh?

219
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,100
So, how about this?
Start fighting.

220
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,569
Start fighting right there,
in your jail cells!

221

[PRISONERS]
Huh?

222
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,906
Those of you who survive

223
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,042
get a free ticket
to join my crew

224
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,643
and sail outta here with me!

225
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,945
Is he for real?

226
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,346
It's time to play!

227
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,481
Now, who should I kill first?

[laughing]

229
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,426
He had his pick of the
deadliest criminals in the world

230
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,862
and he had them
fight to the death,

231
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,830
while he simply stood
there and watched?

232
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:52,733
Yes, but only four of the
prisoners were taken--

233
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,069
San Juan Wolf, Avalo Pizarro,

234
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:58,271
Vasco Shot, and
Catarina Devon, as you saw.

235
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,007
But I'm sorry to say, sir,

236
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,176
that his new recruits
aren't the only prisoners

237
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,344
who are missing from Level 6.

swimming with escaped criminals,

the worst the world
has ever seen.

241
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,962
We can't let a single
one of them get away.

242
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,199
If they stole a ship and slipped
into some country unnoticed,

243
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:28,368
there's no telling what sort
of terrible things might happen!

244
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,639
Start a count of how many
Level 6 prisoners are missing.

245
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,640
Get their names and
put out a most wanted list

Well, uh, actually...

250
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,318
I'm under direct orders
from the World Government

251
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,020
to keep this matter
a secret at any cost.

Huh?

00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:49,757
A huge blunder like this one

254
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,560

I possibly could.

So, does that mean...
that he'll be okay?

We'll just have to wait and see.

for now. However...

[HANCOCK grunts]

327
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,109
He took on a lot more damage
than most could endure,

that he'll survive.

onto the ship as well.

345
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,651
[IVANKOV grunts]

346
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,386
I can't believe
he pushed his body

347
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,522
past its limit a second time!

348
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:52,359
That's how strong the bond was
between Straw Boy and Ace Boy!

349
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,527
[TAILCOAT]
You tell 'em, Iva!

350
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,661
Nothing could stop him then

351
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,464
and nothing will
stop him now, right?

352
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:02,436
I wish that were so,
but fate can be cruel.

353
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,071
You can't save everyone.

354
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,708
All of that work for nothing!

355
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,679
He's nearly dead because that's
the kind of world this is!

356
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,013
Don't get down now, Iva!

357
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,316
Straw Hat can pull
through this, I know it!

358
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,819
Ya gotta live, Straw Hat!
Don't you dare die on us!

359
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:24,791
[PRISONERS cheering]

360
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,094
Luffy has touched so many lives!

361
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,663
If only there was some way
I could take his place

362
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,033
so that he may survive!

363
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,202
Poor darling! [cries]

364
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,503
[PENGUIN sighs]

365
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:37,905
So lucky.

366
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,607
[PENGUIN] Must be nice
having the Pirate Empress

367
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,907
fawn over you like that.

368
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,042
[SHACHI]
Yeah, wow.

369
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,377
You're a new face.

370
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,345
Are you one of Straw Boy's pals?

371
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,981
No. I can't say why I saved him,

372
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,750
or it's complicated at least.

373
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:51,785
Are you gonna pressure
me for the details?

374
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,823
No, no. Let's just say that your
heart guided you to his side.

375
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:56,924
[HEART PIRATE A]
Hey, wait!

376
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,391
[HEART PIRATE B]
You can't walk around yet!

377
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,293
[HEART PIRATE A]
Don't push your body like that!

378
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,429
[HEART PIRATE B] Captain
told you to rest, remember?

379
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,064
Your wound could open up!

380
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,099
[HEART PIRATE B]
Come back here, please!

381
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,469
Leave me be.

382
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,206
[IVANKOV]
Jimbei...

383
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,474
[pants]

384
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,043
I know you...

385
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:18,612
Captain Law from the North Blue.

386
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,181
[LAW]
Hm.

387
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:22,382
You look awful,

388
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,518
should you really be
moving around like that?

389
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,953
[JIMBEI panting]

390
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,320
I owe you...

391
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,189
[panting]

392
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,624
I owe you my life!

393
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,759
Enough. Lie down.

394
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,795
[JIMBEI grunts]
My mind is troubled.

395
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,833
Luffy--the pain I feel for him
is such that I can't rest.

396
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,601
I have failed you, friend.

397
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,869
Remorse...

398
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:46,907
If this is how I feel,
then just imagine him.

399
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,742
His collapse may
have been a mercy,

400
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:52,913
since it allowed us to take
him away, but what now?

401
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:56,683
Even if he survives,
with the immensity of his loss,

402
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,719
I fear for the
moment he awakens.

403
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:07,828
You, the fuzzy one.

404
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:09,630
Where's your transponder snail?

405
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,065
[BEPO gasps]

406
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,032
Who, me?

407
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,901
Uh, I'll go get it!
If you'd like...

408
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:18,171
No fair. I wish I got to
serve the empress, too!

409
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,740
[SHACHI]
Mmm-hmm.

410
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,141
[HANCOCK]
I will summon the Kuja ship,

411
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,778
so we can sail across the Calm
Belt, even with this submarine.

412
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:27,281
The World Government can't
find out Luffy's alive,

413
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,216
or else they'll come after him!

414
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,685
Let us harbor him safely
at the Maiden Island!

415
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:32,553
[JIMBEI grunts]

416
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,754
Really?

417
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,324
As long as they still
view me as a Warlord,

418
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:39,859
Luffy will not
be in danger there!

419
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:54,474
[LUFFY breathing]

420
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:03,550
[HANCOCK]
Luffy.

421
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:16,664
[NARRATOR] At Hancock's order,
Luffy is taken to Amazon Lily

422
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:19,032
to hide from the Navy
while he recovers.

423
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,868
Although Law was able
to tend to his injuries,

424
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,573
when he awakens, Luffy is
haunted by memories of the war

425
00:23:25,606 --> 00:23:27,874
and falls into deep despair.

426
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,776
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

427
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,712
"Landing at the Maiden Island!

428
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,615
The Harsh Reality
Falls Upon Luffy!"

429
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,117
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
