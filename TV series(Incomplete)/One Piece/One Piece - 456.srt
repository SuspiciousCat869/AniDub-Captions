1
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,533
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,202
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:42,971
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:45,607
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,275
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,178
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,479
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:54,549
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,519
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,120
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,688
of the World Government,

12
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,059
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,395
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:10,465
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:14,002
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

16
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:19,107
The crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,411
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the rest of his crew,

18
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,980
Luffy makes his way to Navy HQ

19
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,516
to rescue his brother
Ace from execution.

20
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,718
Meanwhile, the other
Straw Hat Pirates

21
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,087
have adventures of their own.

22
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:36,124
[LUFFY]
"The Friends' Whereabouts!

23
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:39,093
A Huge Tomb and the Panty Debt!"

24
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,300
[NARRATOR]
Far away, but not long ago,

25
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,135
Zoro found himself trapped

26
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:50,672
on a certain gloomy
island with Perona.

27
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,546
[ZORO] I can't take this
anymore. I gotta hurry.

28
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,253
[PERONA] Where did that
sword-swinging simpleton

29
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,555
run off to this time?

30
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:25,440
[ZORO pants]
Oh, come on, gimme a break!

31
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,610
I can't find the
stinkin' bedroom!

32
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:33,481
[ZORO panting]

33
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:36,751
[ZORO] It's like I'm
stuck in a maze!

34
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:38,052
This way!

35
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,433
What am I even doing?
This is a waste of time.

36
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:00,041
[PERONA] "Hide his sword!
It'll be fun!" I thought.

37
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,176
"Use your Negative Hollow
to make him depressed!"

38
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,380
That'll be hilarious!
Only I had to tell him where

39
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:10,618
his sword was, and two days
later, he still can't find it.

40
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:13,388
Wow Zoro, I guess
you sure showed me.

41
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,423
Great, now I'm depressed.

42
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:20,228
[screams]

43
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,396
Why're you here?

44
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,731
Are you tryin' to use your
power to mess with my head?

45
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,166
I live here!

46
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,368
And you're depressing
enough without my help!

47
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,437
Besides, I told you
where your sword was!

48
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,471
[ZORO grunts]

49
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:32,340
[PERONA] Climb the stairs
directly behind me,

50
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,576
follow the hallway and get your
stupid sword back, okay?

51
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,246
Do you need me to hold
your hand, little boy?

52
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,848
You keep giving out crappy
directions to trick me!

53
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,352
Uh! Have you got brain
worms or something?

54
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,520
That's the wrong way.

55
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,587
[ZORO growls]

56
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:48,823
Behind me! Come on!

57
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:52,193
What, is your sense of
hearing messed up, too?

58
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,228
I shouldn't have
taken his sword away.

59
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,764
I didn't think he'd
be so sad without it.

60
00:05:56,798 --> 00:06:01,302
This isn't funny at all.
In fact, it's a tragedy!

61
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,673
[PERONA]
Poor thing.

62
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:09,277
You're the one who
did this to me!

63
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,845
Keep at it, buddy,
you'll be okay!

64
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,581
[ZORO growling]

65
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,683
Go, Zoro!

66
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:18,319
That's enough!

67
00:06:20,655 --> 00:06:22,423
[PERONA]
Here, just take it.

68
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:25,259
[ZORO]
Why the change of heart?

69
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,428
I'm bored of your
antics, that's all.

70
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,330
And it's not like you're
any threat to me.

71
00:06:29,363 --> 00:06:31,833
This form is no different
than one of my ghosts.

72
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:35,203
You'd have to attack my
real body to do any harm.

73
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:38,206
And the chance of you
finding it is like, zero.

74
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,709
And besides, you're not cute
enough to be one of my servants.

75
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,377
[laughs]

76
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,783
[PERONA] You really
think I'm doing this

77
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,686
out of kindness, dingbat?
If this plan works out,

78
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,455
I get back to my life
on Thriller Bark.

79
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,357
If you're going to
be this stupid,

80
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,926
I'm almost required to
take advantage of you.

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,496
This spooky little vacation
has been fun enough,

82
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,233
but you're my ticket out of
here and I'm going to use you.

83
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,268
Lucky me, huh?

84
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:14,242
[PERONA] What? Why didn't
I see that coming?!

85
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:17,478
I've gotta stop freaking
out and follow him!

86
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,314
He'll just get lost
again! What is he thinking?

87
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:31,425
I gotta get
back to Sabaody.

88
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,628
It's been too long already and
we were in pretty bad shape

89
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,862
when I got sent away!

90
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:37,598
I just hope everyone
made it out all right.

91
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:41,636
Everyone start running and
look after your selves!

92
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,740
We can't win this one!
We're too weak!

93
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:48,075
Get moving!

94
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,211
[BROOK]
Wait, do I-- Ah!

95
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,280
[USOPP]
Sanji!

96
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:53,481
[LUFFY groans]

97
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,150
--[USOPP screams]
--[ZORO whimpers]

98
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:58,452
I can't just stay here,
doing nothing!

99
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:00,855
They could be hurt. Or worse!

100
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,268
Ah-ha!

101
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:18,739
[ZORO] That castle looks
familiar. I think.

102
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,843
Hm... Oh, I get it!

103
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,180
Ha, ha. It's like the other
one. Why'd they build two?

104
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:30,384
[PERONA groans]
So that's how your head works?

105
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,354
How did you ever
survive for this long?

106
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,426
[sighs] I really have
a kind heart, don't I?

107
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,429
I don't have to guide him
to the sea, but here I am!

108
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:44,899
Well, he'll be doing me a favor
in the end, so no biggie!

109
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:46,868
You sure this is
the right way to go?

110
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,371
[PERONA] Don't you dare!
You're gonna get us lost!

111
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,839
You aren't allowed to complain.

112
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:54,475
No more talking, just
follow in silence!

113
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,377
Sounds good.

114
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,849
[PERONA] Agh! Stop!
You're drifting off already!

115
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,718
[ZORO]
Huh. So much for silence.

116
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,686
[PERONA] So much for you
following me, you idiot!

117
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,921
[ZORO]
What's that?

118
00:09:06,954 --> 00:09:09,557
[PERONA] Did you forget that
I'm leading the way, or what?

119
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,692
[ZORO] I dunno.
Guess you're just a bad leader.

120
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:15,363
[PERONA gasps]
Oh, it's my fault, of course!

121
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:20,501
[sighs] I'm not even really
here and he's wearing me out.

122
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:23,938
[ZORO]
What's the deal?

123
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:24,939
[PERONA sighs]

124
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,874
[ZORO] Don't act tired.
You're not even walking.

125
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,443
[PERONA]
It's you! I'm tired of you!

126
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,212
[ZORO]
What did I do?

127
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,815
[PERONA] Just ignore him,
Perona. Don't lose your cool.

128
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,784
[ZORO] Huh. This tree
looks kind of familiar.

129
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:39,287
[PERONA]
We're in a forest!

130
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:48,296
What was that?

131
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:51,399
[PERONA] Maybe that Kuma guy
sent someone else here, too!

132
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,234
I'd better go check!

133
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:56,570
Hey, where are you going?

134
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,606
I'm getting out of here,
'cause I just found out

135
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,409
that I don't need your
useless hide after all!

136
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:06,213
[PERONA] You can walk
in circles till you die!

137
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,650
I wonder who it is?

138
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:12,620
I just hope it's someone
a little cuter this time.

139
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,425
[laughs]

140
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,993
Hey. Ya came back, huh?

141
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:23,698
[screams] Wha... What're
you doing here?

142
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,968
Why wouldn't I be here? The
ocean is this way, isn't it?

143
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,969
[PERONA]
Well, I mean, yeah,

144
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,271
but it's not like you
could figure that out!

145
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:32,573
He isn't human.

146
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:35,676
He's a god of trickery
sent to torment me!

147
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,511
Or something.

148
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,837
[ZORO] Looks like someone
did that recently.

149
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,741
[PERONA] Ugh, what a letdown.
It was just a tree falling.

150
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:09,410
Guess it's back to
my original plan.

151
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:13,047
I was really looking forward
to dumping him, though.

152
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,384
Y'know, I do cherish these
abandoned battlefields!

153
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,919
Delightfully morose!

154
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,058
Maybe that fallen tree was
the work of tortured souls,

155
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:26,761
trapped in their place of death!

156
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:28,829
I've got a different
theory on that.

157
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,431
[PERONA]
Uh?

158
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:40,608
Uh! Hey, don't go! Wait!

159
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,473
The heck is this?

160
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,141
It looks like a grave.

161
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:16,477
The question's who made it?

162
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,612
[ZORO] Whoever they are,
they've got some skill.

163
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:20,748
It was carved straight
out of that tree.

164
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,918
[PERONA] I dunno if this is
"good creepy" or "bad creepy."

165
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:29,023
[ZORO] There it is again.
I knew someone was here.

166
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,530
[ZORO growls]

167
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,803
[ZORO gasps]

168
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,373
They're fast.

169
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,626
Damn it. He's strong, too!

170
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,862
Uh-oh! Look out!

171
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,029
[ZORO grunts]

172
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,766
[PERONA gasping]

173
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,186
What are those things?

174
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:36,123
[growls, roars]

175
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,576
[NARRATOR]
This is Lazy Bones Island

176
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,244
in the Land of
Poverty, Hungaria.

177
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,445
Sent here by Kuma,

178
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:02,950
Brook was mistaken for Satan
by the island's inhabitants.

179
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:15,763
[yawns] How lovely!
Another perfect day!

180
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,835
[BROOK]
And yet, so lonely.

181
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,742
[BROOK] If only I could share
the sunrise with my friends.

182
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,145
Yes. I'm sure
I can, someday!

183
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:35,549
Because whatever happens,
the sun will always rise!

184
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,085
So long as I stay alive,
I have hope.

185
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,588
We will all meet again.

186
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,998
[BROOK]
My goodness, this island

187
00:14:51,031 --> 00:14:55,169
certainly is in an unfortunate
state, though, isn't it?

188
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:57,171
And such a strange place.

189
00:14:57,204 --> 00:14:59,640
I didn't think about
it much yesterday.

190
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:03,544
But that house was full
of oddities. Those dolls.

191
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,146
And the strange tapestries
adorning the wall.

192
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,183
Not to mention all of the
macabre-looking decorations.

193
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:11,819
It seems they were performing
some sort of ritual,

194
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:13,988
but I can't guess the purpose.

195
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:18,692
It's rather foreboding.
Even if they were kind to me.

196
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,894
[PEKKORI]
Oh, good! You're awake.

197
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,297
We were just about to bring
you an offering of breakfast,

198
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,232
as I'm sure you must
be quite famished

199
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,702
after your journey to
the realm of humans.

200
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:30,771
My, how considerate of you.

201
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,806
[PEKKORI] Oh, it's
the least we could do!

202
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,711
[laughs] Such kindness,
and from total strangers!

203
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:38,779
You have my gratitude!

204
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,116
Forgive me. I should've
introduced myself, first.

205
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,984
I am the leader of
this humble country.

206
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:45,753
You may call me Pekkori.

207
00:15:45,786 --> 00:15:50,057
Well, Pekkori. Thank you, I
shall relish this gift of yours.

208
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:55,929
[gasps]

209
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,699
Young lady.

210
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:01,935
[whimpers]

211
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:05,239
Would you be so kind as
to show me your panties?

212
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,641
[GIRL A gasps]

213
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,679
It shall be! Everyone
show him your underwear!

214
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:15,916
[BROOK] Oh no no,
that's quite all right,

215
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,752
just the young lady will
be more than adequate!

216
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:20,888
Please, there's no
need to be bashful.

217
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:22,656
We have plenty to go around!

218
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,652
[BROOK] Ah! Really,
I've had my fill!

219
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,425
Ah, thank you so much
for this generous feast!

220
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,028
My stomach's so full,
I can scarcely move!

221
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,463
[stomach growls]

222
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,164
[BROOK]
T-That was a joke, you see.

223
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,400
I-I clearly don't have
a stomach, after all!

224
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:45,037
[groans]

225
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,773
[WORSHIPPER B] That food was
supposed to last us all week.

226
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,142
[WORSHIPPER C]
Shh! Be patient for now!

227
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,411
[PEKKORI]
Uh. Lord Satan.

228
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,382
I believe you mentioned that
you wanted to ask us a favor.

229
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,052
Yes, I need to set sail right
away. Do you have a ship?

230
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,954
But... my Lord?

231
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,189
Has one of us done something
to displease you?

232
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,324
N-No!

233
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:09,862
[PEKKORI] Ah! Everyone, quickly!
Show him your underwear!

234
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,131
[BROOK]
Enough with the under-- Whoa!

235
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,233
[panting]

236
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,468
Is our underwear not
good enough anymore?

237
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,105
[BROOK grunts] No, your
underwear is perfectly fine.

238
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,908
I've been separated from
my friends, you see.

239
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,844
I'm afraid I must return
to them, whatever the cost.

240
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,945
"Return to them?"

241
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,513
[BROOK]
Yes.

242
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,815
A-At any cost, you say?

243
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,419
Yes. I must go. I'm truly sorry.

244
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,289
Then we're finished.

245
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,059
If our undergarments
no longer satisfy you,

246
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,127
we have nothing else to give!

247
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,297
Our beloved country will die.

248
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,566
The suffering will
only get worse.

249
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,968
We should just take
our lives now.

250
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,437
[BROOK]
No need to overreact!

251
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,205
I'm sure we can come
up with something.

252
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,139
[WORSHIPPERS]
Like what?

253
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,207
For starters,

254
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,143
could you tell me a bit
more about your situation?

255
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,979
Why do you call me
"Satan," for example?

256
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,281
And what was it you mentioned

257
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,516
about the Longarm
Tribe last night?

258
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,320
I may be able to help you yet.

259
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:12,191
[PEKKORI whimpers]

260
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,027
Our dear country has
long been overrun

261
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,363
by the cruel and vicious
members of the Longarm Tribe.

262
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,234
Not only do they take our money,
our food, our belongings,

263
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,938
but they also strike down or
enslave our sons and daughters.

264
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,108
As you can see,
it's left us devastated.

265
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,844
We scarcely have the
clothes on our backs.

266
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,313
[BROOK gasps] Then, the
food that you gave me...

267
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,249
[PEKKORI] I'm ashamed
to say it was all we had.

268
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,885
We felt we should make
some sort of offering.

269
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, no.

270
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,890
There was nothing we could do
to escape our terrible fate.

271
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,327
Except pray to every god
and goddess we could name,

272
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,562
and many who were
long forgotten.

273
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,697
And when that failed us,

274
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,100
we called upon the powers
of witches and sorcerers,

275
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,103
in the hopes that they could
curse our enemies to death.

276
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,605
[gasps]

277
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,306
And then, in the end,

278
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,210
we turned to the blackest
magic of all and called you!

279
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,646
So desperate was our plight,
we would summon even

280
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,182
the Lord of all
evil into our midst!

281
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,584
Lord Satan, we can
take no more!

282
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,586
Our people are doomed
without your aid.

283
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,090
Face the Longarm Tribe and
deal them a bloody blow!

284
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,658
We beg of you!

[WORSHIPPERS]
We beg of you!

286
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,262
You... think I can?

287
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:24,396
Yes!

288
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,032
Preferably curse them to death,
although at this point,

289
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,168
just about anything will do.

Please, my lord!

00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,904

time! You hear me?

them take me away!

her, aren't they?

[WORSHIPPER L]
Uh-huh.

310
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,452
[PEKKORI]
Unless you curse them!

Yes, now is the time!

Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

We're too late.

[BROOK] But why didn't
they do anything?

She's their friend!
Their family!

319
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,441
Is the situation
really so hopeless

320
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,676
that they can't
even fight back?

321
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,078
Did you hear us, Satan?

322
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,112
[BROOK]
Huh?

00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,448
[PEKKORI] Did you?
We were cheering extra hard!

You can save us
now, oh Dark Lord!

Give it your best!

them in this situation now.

suffer such a cruel fate.

Not to mention the panties.

will have to wait.

safe until then.

00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,688
[JIMBEI] It's been almost an
hour since we've left Impel Down

341
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,456
and the winds are strong.

342
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,360
It's odd that we haven't reached
Navy Headquarters yet.

343
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:12,397
Don't think you could hurry
it up a bit, do you? Huh?

344
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,633
At this rate, there won't
be any carnage left for me

345
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,435
by the time we get there.

346
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,502
Calm yourself.

347
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,505
Those Navy bastards
better not kill Whitebeard.

348
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,708
'Cause that's my job.

349
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,543
You still insist on that?

350
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,144
If you wanna piss
and moan about it,

351
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,613
I'd be happy to kill you first.

352
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,353
[JIMBEI growls]

353
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,361
[CROCODILE]
Huh?

354
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,462
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

355
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,702
What's wrong, friend?

356
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:58,810
I'm comin' for you, Ace.
It's not over. Not yet!

357
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,734
[NARRATOR] Luffy and company
continue on the tub current

358
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,303
with Marine Ford looming
on the horizon.

359
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,806
Staring impatiently at his
brother's vivre card,

360
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,409
Luffy's reminded of
more innocent times.

361
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,676
Then, in nearby waters,

362
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,379
Ace is haunted by a
recollection of his own.

363
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,148
[LUFFY]
On the next, One Piece!

364
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,750
"Retrospective
Before Marineford!

365
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,485
The Vow of Brotherhood!"

366
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,854
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates!
