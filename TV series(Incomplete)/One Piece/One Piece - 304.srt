00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,392
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,195
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

3
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,499
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:50,638
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,407
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

6
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,044
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

7
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,179
Now you just have to find it!

8
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,616
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

9
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,653
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

10
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,322
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

11
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,091
[SANJI]
Hey, Sniper King!

12
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,359
[ZORO]
Things have gotten serious.

13
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,361
Hurry up and jump
down from there.

14
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,167
--No, Usopp!
--No, Usopp!

15
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,281
[ZORO]
He--He can't be--

16
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,384
Where are you, Usopp?

17
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,754
[USOPP yelling]

18
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,024
[USOPP]
Someone say my name?

19
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,264
Why'd you make us
think you were dead?

20
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,333
[USOPP] You guys couldn't even
be bothered to catch a hero

21
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,602
who's plunged off an
exploding, falling building?

22
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,704
Some friends you are!

23
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,240
[FRANKY] You noticed the ship
on the other side of the bridge,

24
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,441
right?

25
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,343
I'm thinkin' it's our best
chance to get out of this mess.

26
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,178
Well, we're already
wanted criminals,

27
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,679
we might as well
steal a ship.

28
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,581
Franky...

29
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,784
...Transform!

30
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,562
Now gaze upon Franky Centaur!

31
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,032
[FRANKY]
Hey, get back here!

32
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,035
[LUCCI] But that
doesn't mean you should.

33
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,638
It's obvious that you're
pushing your body too far.

34
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,040
And I doubt that you
can take much more.

35
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,342
Not very clever, are you?

36
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,244
You're shortening
your own lifespan,

37
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,246
just for a few
minutes of strength.

38
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,781
It's better than
letting you take away

39
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,383
everything I care about!

40
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,652
I'll do anything
to keep that from happening.

41
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,088
But you've still lost,
even if you do defeat me!

42
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,457
Tempest Kick!

43
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,036
But don't let me
stop you from trying.

44
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,804
I'm interested to see
how far you'll go

45
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,574
in your misguided attempts
to save your little friends.

46
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,276
This isn't a game
we're playing, damn it!

[SPANDAM]
Hey! Why're you running?

51
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,184
Get back here!

52
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,592
Oh, no!

53
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,129
[SPANDAM chuckling]

54
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,033
[SPANDAM] You asked for it, Nico
Robin! The Buster Call is here!

55
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,156
[SPANDAM] The invocation
of merciless death.

56
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,559
The Buster Call
has finally begun!

00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,266
[LUFFY] "I Can't Protect
Anyone Unless I Win!

[RANDOM MARINE 304A]
I repeat.

60
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,453
Our targets are Straw Hat Luffy

61
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,523
and his crew of
approximately sixty pirates.

62
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:06,427
To ensure their demise, destroy
everything on Enies Lobby!

63
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,596
[PEOPLE screaming]

64
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,631
[SPANDAM]
Hey! Wait. Stop!

65
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,701
Hey! Stop running, dammit!
Open your eyes!

66
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:17,070
Oh, come on, the battleships
aren't gonna attack the bridge!

67
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,515
Not as long as
I'm on it, at least!

68
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,584
It's exactly like
my father said it was!

69
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,454
He told me he stood unscathed
amidst the destruction!

70
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,391
[RANDOM MARINE 304A]
For the time being,

71
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,592
avoid targeting the bridge

72
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,728
where the criminal
Nico Robin is.

73
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,797
[SPANDAM] Hey, come on! I'm
telling ya, you're safe with me!

74
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,101
They wouldn't even think
of harming the chief of CP9!

75
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:52,239
[laughing maniacally]

76
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,543
This is just complete
and total madness.

77
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,380
Hey. You okay?

78
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,057
[ROBIN]
I can't stop shaking.

79
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,343
[ELDER STAR B] Now commencing
the Buster Call.

80
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,378
All ships, fire at once.

81
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,248
Everything on the island
of Ohara is your target.

82
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:35,783
Let nothing remain.

83
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:39,820
Annihilate the devils of Ohara!
Burn it to the ground!

84
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,322
In the name of justice!

85
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:14,488
[ROBIN] The Buster Call--
A merciless act of destruction;

86
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,290
indifferent to the
horror it creates.

87
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,329
There won't be
a single life spared.

88
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,266
Its hellfire consumes all.

89
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,369
How can this happen?

90
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:33,206
Not even once. But twice?

91
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,439
[USOPP] Try to pick up the pace,
you guys! We're in a hurry here!

92
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,245
Quit bossing us
around, you moron!

93
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,147
[USOPP] Hey, my
injuries are bad enough,

94
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,115
let's not hurt
my feelings, too!

95
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,184
Speaking of which, could you
guys be a little more gentle?

96
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,386
You know, you were unconscious
before we picked you up,

97
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,156
and to be honest, I think
I liked it better that way!

98
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,458
How can you talk to your
fearless leader like that?

99
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,427
Especially when I've been
so seriously injured

100
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,696
in the line of duty!

101
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,265
All of my ribs
are broken! All six!

102
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,833
Well, you've got
more ribs than that!

103
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,768
Man, you're a royal
pain in the ass.

104
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,604
[USOPP] To change the subject,
I'm sure you're dying to know

105
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,540
the secret of my
new weapon, Kabuto.

106
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,674
Let me explain.

107
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,144
The great weapon of the
even greater Sniper King is--

108
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,747
If you don't can it, we're
gonna make you get up and run!

109
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,617
So much pain. Did I mention
my ribs are broken?

110
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,218
All ten are smashed.

111
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,319
[SANJI]
You've got more.

112
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:56,156
[USOPP] Really? Uh, twenty?
No, no, I mean thirty.

113
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,725
Actually, one hundred!

114
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,692
[ZORO and SANJI]
Even more!

115
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:01,461
[USOPP] Is my body made
of nothing but ribs?

116
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,073
Was that cannon fire?

117
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,377
You can always leave it to those
Navy boys to put on a big show!

118
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,613
Awesome! They're firing cannons!

119
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,682
It's not the same as shooting
off a bunch of fireworks,

120
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,649
you know.

121
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,485
Anyway, do you guys
know where Luffy's at?

122
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,786
Oh, yeah, pirate lady,

123
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,688
it was the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

124
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,690
Did you see those great
big doors back there?

125
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,458
The pirate guy
knocked 'em down!

126
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,626
Luffy did?

127
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,729
It was awesome! Even though
he got all small from it.

128
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,830
[GONBE vocalizing]

129
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,466
Wait, back up.
He got "all small"?

130
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,500
[CHIMNEY]
Uh-huh!

131
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,638
[LUFFY]
So this is it, huh?

132
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,143

It's open.

135
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,296
[LUFFY] All right!
Time to head out!

136
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,732
No way! How'd you
make yourself all tiny?

137
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,903
[NAMI]
He said 'Third Gear'?

138
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,405
And then busted through
iron doors and turned small?

139
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,673
What is going on?

140
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,443
[KOKORO] I don't know, but that
Straw Hat sure is a lot of fun!

141
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,378
[CHIMNEY] Yeah, Granny!
The pirate guy's

142
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,414
almost as awesome as you are!

143
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,217
None of this is making
any sense to me at all.

144
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,285
Anyway, we'd better hurry.

145
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,257
Hey, Granny? I think I hear
something weird comin' this way.

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,425

147
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,160
[NAMI] Yeah,
I hear something, too.

00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,495
We don't have time
to go worryin'

149
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,763
about any strange sounds.

150
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,600
If it's comin' this way, we'll
find out what it is soon enough.

151
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,637
We're gonna make those
government jerks pay!

152
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,372

--Why is this happening?
--What do we do? Where do we go?

There's no way out!
Somebody help us!

00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,688
Whether your friends die
in that tunnel or not,

160
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,723
there's no way anyone
can make it here now.

161
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,525
You bastard!

162
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:48,028
Even this room will
be submerged before long.

164
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,471
You get back here now!

165
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:18,759
We're above sea level now,
so we can finish this fight

166
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,361
without the fear of drowning.

[HATORI coos]

168
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,664
You can hear that, right?

169
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,266
The rumble of the
ships' cannon fire?

170
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,147
I wonder how your pirate crew
is faring up there?

171
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,450
And Nico Robin, I wonder
what happened to her?

00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,286
I'd be pretty concerned
if I were you.

173
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:59,266
[LUCCI] I won't stop you if you
want to run off to save them.

174
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,502
I'm not takin' my eyes off you
until you're down for good.

175
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,641
Whatever's goin' on,

176
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,678
my friends can survive
anything thrown their way,

177
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,280
but if I turn
my back on you now,

178
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,616
all you're gonna do
is try and kill them.

179
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:19,119
So I'm not going anywhere
'til you and I are through.

180
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,221
[SANJI] Sounds like
they've started the attack.

181
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,322
[USOPP]
Speaking of sounds,

182
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,725
I keep hearing something
weird from down the tunnel.

183
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,727
Ya hear me tellin'
you to shut up?

184
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,127
Come on!

185
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,368
[USOPP]
So much pain.

186
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,256
[USOPP] Hm, there's definitely
something wrong here.

187
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,223
Unlike the two of you,

188
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,326
I have a finely tuned
sense of perception,

189
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,362
and I'm telling you there's
something strange up ahead.

190
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,631
The sound I'm hearing must be--

191
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:44,204
Hey! Wait for me!

192
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,739
[USOPP]
I'm up!

193
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,542
I broke another thirty ribs!
Wait up, dammit!

194
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:51,612
How do you expect me to run
with all these broken ribs?

195
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,546
Come back!

196
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:59,053
[NAMI, KOKORO,
CHIMNEY, GONBE screaming]

197
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,388
Where's this water
coming from, Granny?

198
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,791
That doesn't matter, Chimney,
just keep running!

199
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:09,629
[ALL screaming]

200
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,242
You've got some determination.

201
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:24,612
It's almost a pity you're
on the wrong side of the law.

202
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:28,281
Although, let's see if you
can back up those big words.

203
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:35,255
It's gonna turn out the same
whether you live or die!

204
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:57,143
[laughing maniacally]

205
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,715
Hey. C'mon. Quit trembling
and go capture Nico Robin!

206
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,651
The sooner this is over
and done with,

207
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:06,153
the sooner I'll be seen
as the world's hero!

208
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,621
Why even the Buster Call
sounds like

209
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,424
a firework celebration
held in my honor!

210
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:18,198
[laughing maniacally]

211
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,611
Razor!

212
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,752
[LUCCI]
Finger Pistol!

213
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,789
[LUCCI] Tempest Kick!
Leopard Tail!

214
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,666
You really think
you can defeat me?

215
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:56,336
I can't protect anyone
unless I do!

216
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,408
Now Gum-Gum...

217
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,712
...Rifle!

218
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,315
Iron Body Empty Tree!

219
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,788
[LUFFY screaming]

220
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,235
[LUCCI]
Razor.

221
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,444
Even though you're going to die,

222
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,780
you've done well to get this far
against the World Government.

223
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,753
Still, you're no different than
any other pirate I've fought.

224
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,055
You've got guts,
but it takes more than that

225
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,123
to defeat someone like me.

226
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:12,112
Now Gum-Gum Pistol!

227
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,417
[LUFFY yelling]

228
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,052
Flying Finger Pistol.

229
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:24,457
Sting!

230
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,005
Rapid Fire, Triple Sting!

231
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:08,134
Flying Finger Pistol.
Fire Sting.

232
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,761
I'd be sorely disappointed
if I'd been expecting

233
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,730
any sort of real
challenge from you.

234
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,432
I bet you wasted
all of your strength

235
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,101
on those leg pumps
earlier, didn't you?

236
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,312
[LUFFY] So, you were lookin'
for a real challenge, huh?

237
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,447
Well, I got one more trick.

238
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,116
Just remember
this was your idea.

239
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:59,219
Third Gear!

240
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:10,831
[LUFFY]
Bone Balloon!

241
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:12,499
Balloon?

242
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,502
The power moves
from one bone to another.

243
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:20,341
[LUFFY] Take a look!
My left arm is now...

244
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:23,176
...the arm of a giant!

245
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,213
[LUCCI] You can't intimidate
me with your tricks.

246
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,749
Now Gum-Gum...

247
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:29,817
Iron Body.

248
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,653
...Giant Pistol!

249
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,666
Wha-- What the hell
is that thing?

250
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,497
[LUCCI] Justice will never lie
down and surrender to evil.

251
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,532
If there's a soldier
incapable of standing up

252
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,335
to protect what's right,
that makes him a criminal

253
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,269
in my eyes.

254
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,638
Everything I do is
in the name of justice.

255
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:28,075
Until now, and until I die!

256
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,810
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

257
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,345
"Shivering Past!

258
00:23:31,378 --> 00:23:33,647
Dark Justice
and Rob Lucci!"

259
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,283
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
