[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,595
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,099
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:50,070
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,273
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,374
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,744
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,213
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,449
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,686
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,089
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,094
[NAMI]
Chopper! What's wrong with you?

13
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,597
It's me! Nami! Look!

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:24,572
[monstrous roars]

15
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,439
Stop it!

16
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,212
Why are you doing this?

17
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,194
[loud crashing and splashing]

18
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,497
[KALIFA]
Time is running short.

19
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,533
Tempest Kick!

20
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,400
Uh-oh.

21
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,267
I don't think I can dodge

22
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,703
when my legs are
slippery like this!

23
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,008
Huh? I'm still okay?

24
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,311
One of my legs
is back to normal.

25
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,247
But why?

26
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,647
Did I miss something?

27
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,516
It's wet.

28
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,353
It must've happened when
Chopper threw the bathtub.

29
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,420
Wait!

30
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,421
I get it!

31
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,324
All I have to do wash
the soap off with water!

32
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,373
Let's not be hasty.

33
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,342
Even if you can
counter the effects

34
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,077
of my Golden Bubbles with water,

35
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,679
that doesn't mean
I'm going to stand by

36
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,146
and let you do it.

37
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,053
Sheep Cloud! Relaxing Bubbles!

38
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,422
No problem.

39
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,591
This is nothing a
little wind can't fix!

40
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,792
Now, Cyclone--

41
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,527
[NAMI]
Damn it!

42
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,668
Oh no, my strength is--

43
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,339
Supple Finger Pistol!

44
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,609
My Takt.

45
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,277
[KALIFA]
Whip!

46
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,461
[NAMI]
That was helpful.

47
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,029
[KALIFA]
Helpful?

48
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,767
If you blow me away
with an attack like that,

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,569
then those annoying
bubbles of yours

50
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,771
get blown away, too.

51
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,772
Aren't you tough!

52
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,773
Well, if you like,

53
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,143
I'll blow you away until
there's nothing left!

54
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,349
The forecast is cloudy!

55
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,450
Cloudy Tempo!

56
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,222
Ha! This sure beats
that magic show stuff

57
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,690
this thing used to do.

58
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,359
Clouds?

59
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,027
Fighting with lightning again?

60
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,132
These clouds
aren't for lighting.

61
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,201
They're way too thin for that.

62
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:10,704
This time, I have
something else in mind!

63
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,339
I see. Damn.

64
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,074
I should've known!

65
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,078
The forecast is rain! Cool Ball!

66
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,712
Shave!

[NAMI]
Pour down! Rain Tempo!

68
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,093
And I worked so hard.

69
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,496
How rude to wash
everything away.

70
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,532
If your idea of "nice"
is getting my ass beat,

71
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,666
then I'll pass.

72
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,402
Cool Charge!

I've watched your every move.

76
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,452
I know your strengths.

77
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,589
And I know all your
weaknesses as well.

00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,124
[KALIFA]
What's-- What's happening?

79
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,664
Mirage Tempo. Fata Morgana.

80
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,236
[LUFFY]

81
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,412
So this mirage trick of yours--

82
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,681
Only one of you
is actually real?

83
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,515
You got it.

84
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,050
There's only one me.

85
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,253
The other four are
nothing more than illusions.

86
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,755
Distorted reflections
from the freezing air.

87
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,058
Hmph. Simple illusions, huh?

88
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,095
That's quite the mysterious
and elegant tactic.

89
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,663
Regardless, I fail
to see how something

90
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,665
that consists of thin air
can pose any threat to me.

91
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,235
So in other words,

92
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,105
deceptive misdirection
must be your goal.

93
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,473
Well aren't you smart!

94
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,675
You got some confidence back,

95
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,343
and it's not cute at all.

96
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,044
Thunder Charge.

97
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,681
Only one of the five figures

98
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,383
before you is the real me.

99
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,285
Obviously. Your point?

100
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,187
You'll see. Thunder Ball!

101
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,322
Only twenty percent

102
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,458
of these Thunder Ball
attacks are the real deal.

103
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,193
Good luck dodging them.

104
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,828
[KALIFA]
Dammit! But which ones?

105
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,563
I need to guard my-

106
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,502
100 percent real power, though.

107
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,636
I told you, didn't I?

108
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,571
Your arrogance is reckless.

109
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:37,284
You just got hit

with the new and
improved Clima Takt.

111
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,156
A single Thunder Ball
attack is that powerful.

112
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,058
The next attack'll be stronger.

113
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,792
And it's going to end this.

114
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,796
That's a rather bold promise.

115
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,497
And you say I'm arrogant.

116
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,534
It's not a promise.
It's a forecast.

117
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,102
Maybe you haven't realized this,

118
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,271
but the weather in this
room is under my control.

119
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,407
I don't see how that's going

120
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,642
to make any difference for you,

121
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,477
since I'm still a master
of the Six Powers.

122
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,179
Now behave!

123
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,249
What? That was a fake?

124
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,817
You've only got a
twenty percent chance

125
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,418
of finding the real me!

126
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,128
In today's forecast,

127
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:23,364
although we have a
stable pressure system,

128
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,298
you should be on the lookout

129
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,767
for small storm clouds
and violent winds.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,335
And there's a one
hundred percent chance

131
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,138
of a strong bolt of lightning
piercing your chest.

132
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,040
You can expect
paralysis of the heart

133
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,541
to follow shortly after.

134
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,643
Dark Cloud Tempo!

135
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,412
I've already shown
you how easily

136
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,648
I can protect myself
against lightning.

137
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,349
What makes you
think it'll work now?

138
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,085
Although that shell of yours
may be good for blocking,

139
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,320
you can't move at all
when you're using it.

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,162
You don't take me seriously.

141
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,263
You really think
you can puncture

142
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,365
my soap shell with an attack?

143
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,633
Well then.

144
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,167
Soap Sheep!

145
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,305
I don't need to find the
real you to win this battle.

146
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,140
I'll just drench
everything in the room

147
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,775
with a wave of relaxing bubbles!

148
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,681
Sheep Cloud! Tidal Wave!

149
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,123
I'm a goner if I get
hit by that again.

150
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,625
Clearly, the real
you will be the one

151
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,226
left writhing on the floor.

152
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,696
You think I'm gonna
let that happen?

153
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,263
Cyclone Tempo!

154
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,201
She's blowing the
bubbles back with wind!

155
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,643
I'll assume the one
that's still running

156
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,412
for her precious life
is the real one.

157
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,763
Finger pistol!

158
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:05,666
Well I'll be.

159
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,135
I guess you're not
just another illusion.

160
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,771
I'm done playing this game.

161
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,473
I'm gonna fill you
with more holes

162
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:16,176
than a pair of
my fishnet stockings.

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,349
You weren't listening
to me earlier, were you?

164
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,151
You'd have to be a fool

165
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,220
to disregard a
navigator's forecast.

166
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,762
A thunderbolt will
burst from the clouds,

167
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,030
and connect with the Clima Takt.

168
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:44,738
Now.

169
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,243

Not again.

[NAMI]
You might be remarkably strong,

172
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:07,294
but I can predict the weather,
and I'm never wrong.

My friends are waiting for me.

I'll be taking your key now.

00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,728
Son of a bitch. Stupid deer.

00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,413
[FRANKY]
This whole damn island's about

177
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,214
to come apart at the seams.

I hope everybody's okay.

00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,191
Take us with you,
you worthless marines!

here to die like this!

00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,371
Sky Slicer!

184
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,041
Where the hell are you, Chopper?

185
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,344
Get back here!

186
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,714
I said stop, Nico Robin!

187
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,393
Got it!

188
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:10,070
Deer-Gorilla! Bring it on!

189
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:11,405
Franky, what the--?

190
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,440
What are you doing
climbing up the wall?

191
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,208
I don't wanna get into it.

192
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,711
That rampaging
beefed-up deer gorilla

193
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,213
come through this way?

194
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,282
Deer what? Chopper?

195
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:21,982
I guess.

196
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:23,584
I just call him deer-gorilla.

197
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:24,618
Yeah, he did.

198
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,186
What the heck happened to him?

199
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,554
I've never seen
him like that before.

200
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,355
Got me.

201
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,189
Was gonna ask you
the same thing.

202
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,758
He can't usually
transform like that?

203
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,661
Not that I know of.

204
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,697
That's the first time
I've seen anything like it.

205
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,365
Well that's not good.

206
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,433
I was hopin' you might have

207
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,302
some experience
dealing with him.

208
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,305
No other choice--guess
we'll just have to kill him.

209
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:47,241
If you ever say that again,

210
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,476
then I'll have no
choice but to kill you.

211
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,612
Okay, sure, never again.

212
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,380
Message received.

213
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,215
Killing's off the table,

214
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,251
but we've still gotta
stop him somehow.

215
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,586
Seems like it'd be a bad idea

216
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,588
to let him keep on rampaging.

217
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:03,457
I don't think this tower will
last very long if he does.

218
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,793
Yeah, good point.

219
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,261
He doesn't exactly seem

220
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,363
like he's willing to have
a conversation though.

221
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:12,733
I don't think that he
even recognized me earlier.

222
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,402
Maybe he lost his
memory somehow.

223
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,271
What d'ya think
could've caused this?

224
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,173
I've really got no idea.

225
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,408
Although, it's probably
got something to do

226
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,776
with his Devil Fruit powers.

227
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,545
Well if that's
what's going on here,

228
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,347
then I just might have
a solution after all.

229
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:29,683
Oh, by the way.

230
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,684
Nice work in here.

231
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,053
I'm impressed you were
able to take her down.

232
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,822
I'm pretty sure she's
got the key we need.

233
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,523
The number 2 key, that is.

234
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,524
Oh, yeah.

235
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,459
Gimme a sec.

236
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,494
I was just searching for it.

237
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,595
Key, key.

238
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,264
Where could she have hidden it?

239
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:43,964
Yow.

240
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,233
That's some scandalous action.

241
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,269
Stay back, leave us alone!

242
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,570
Uh, I'm warning you.

243
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,606
I've got 8,000 men
under my control who--

244
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,175
Actually, they're
my friend Usopp's men.

245
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,610
But still, they listen to me

246
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,212
and they've already
surrounded this island

247
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,547
so you should just
surrender while you can!

248
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,384
Killing 8,000 guys
sounds like a lot more fun

249
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,085
than what we're doing now.

250
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,488
Go on and give them
a call, let's do this.

251
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:08,589
You moron.

252
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,524
I've never heard a more obvious
lie in all my life.

253
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,525
I don't know how it's possible,

254
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,494
but you're even dumber
than I thought you were.

255
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:14,662
When you act that stupid,

256
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:16,497
you make our
whole team look bad.

257
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,765
Who's the stupid one here?

258
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:20,768
Of course I knew he was lying--I
was just having a little fun!

259
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,436
You're so damn
serious and uptight,

260
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,504
you can't even tell

261
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,205
when someone's
making a freakin' joke.

262
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:27,308
There's nothing wrong with
taking things seriously.

263
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,243
There is when you're
as tall as a damn giraffe

264
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,678
and jokes still go over your
head, you long-necked loser!

265
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,251
It looks like my original
plan is working!

266
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,454
We'll settle this one later.

267
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,323
Yeah. The Buster Call is
fast approaching, after all.

268
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,527
And we've already wasted
enough time here as it is.

269
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,762
Let's just put our differences
aside for the time being.

270
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,298
We can argue after we kill them.

271
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,268
That seems like an overreaction,
let's just calm down!

272
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,737
[JABRA and KAKU]
We are calm!

273
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,605
Tempest Kick!

274
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,243
Oh, crap!

275
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,047
Grab it!

276
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,114
Finger Pistol!

277
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,316
Finger Pistol!

278
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,288
This is real, they're
done toying with us.

279
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,289
Don't drop the sword.

280
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,291
Shave!

281
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,398
We're in big trouble here.

282
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,267
We don't have time
to wait for that key.

283
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,469
We need to get these
cuffs off right now.

284
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,737
Chopper, where the
hell are you? Save me!

285
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,774
[USOPP] Holy crap, it's
another giant monster!

286
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,543
How many of these
Zoan type power holders

287
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:38,545
have they got on
this damn island?

288
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,781
Wait, you sure that's
another CP9 agent?

289
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:43,483
He looks kind of
familiar for some reason.

290
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,554
What? Chopper?

291
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,393
Run!

292
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,195
Back off, Chopper, it's us!

293
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,530
Please, Chopper, don't kill me!

294
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,068
How do we know that
thing really is Chopper?

295
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,703
Why the hell doesn't
he recognize us?

296
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:04,772
I've got no idea,
but that is Chopper!

297
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,773
Who else has antlers

298
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,441
and wears a hat like that?

299
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,243
Then what are we
supposed to do here?

300
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,611
You think he has the key?

301
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,179
No, but what does it matter?

302
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,081
Let's face it, we're gonna die.

303
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:16,516
I don't know, something
doesn't seem right.

304
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:18,386
[ZORO]
He looks like he's the one

305
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,155
who's about to
keel over and die.

306
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,590
Seems like all the life is being

307
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,658
sucked right out of him.

308
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,560
[USOPP]
Well, what's wrong with him?

309
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,195
[ZORO]
I have no idea,

310
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,630
but being in that
form must use up

311
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,732
an enormous amount of energy.

312
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,699
So then what, huh?

313
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,568
How are we supposed
to help him like this?

314
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,703
And what about those two?

315
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:36,804
And where's the key?

316
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,439
Where is the damn key?

317
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:39,573
I don't know about the key,

318
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,242
but I can guess
what happened to him.

319
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:43,244
He probably put his life
on the line fighting against

320
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,778
someone incredibly strong,

321
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:48,349
and when it still wasn't
enough, he turned into that.

322
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,083
And now?

323
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:56,090
Who is this enormous beast?

324
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,658
And why is he
interrupting our fight?

325
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,393
Especially when the
Buster Call's right

326
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,561
around the corner.

327
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:01,729
He's a damn pain.

328
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,398
Must be part of
their dumbass crew.

329
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,300
If they're in our way--

330
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,134
--then we eliminate them.

331
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,072
He looks a bit sick.

332
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,407
Then that just makes
him easier prey.

333
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,645
They're goin' after Chopper!

334
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,413
Stiffen your back.

335
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:20,647
You are still my sword.

336
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:23,149
Whoa, hold on,
we're doin' this again!

337
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,785
Thirty-Six Caliber Phoenix!

338
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,190
You bastard!

339
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,791
[FRANKY]
Step aside, you guys!

340
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,794
[ZORO]
It's you!

341
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:34,494
Hey, hold it!

342
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,195
What do you think you're doing,

343
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:37,264
the deer monster is on our side!

344
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,198
I know what I'm doing.

345
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,766
Shut up and move.

346
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,639
[FRANKY] This is the only
way there is to deal with him.

347
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:48,342
Power holders have one weakness.

348
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,777
I'll knock him into the sea.

349
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,280
Sorry, pal, but this
is for your own good.

350
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:57,284
Coup de--

351
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:01,788
Vent!

352
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,531
That's the last straw, Franky--

353
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,099
you're not gonna
get away with this!

354
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,401
Nobody treats
my friends that way!

355
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,036
[NAMI]
It's okay, guys.

356
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,672
We came up with
this plan together.

357
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,321
[JABRA] Why are they
attacking their own crew?

358
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,223
Doesn't even make any sense.

359
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,190
[KAKU]
I don't know.

360
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:39,726
They're really getting
on my nerves though.

361
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:51,071
You finally managed
to free yourselves, huh?

362
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:55,809
[ZORO] You better stop
laughing and start running.

363
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,412
You blew your only
chance to kill me.

364
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:00,513
And you're not getting another.

365
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,650
It's my turn and I'm
taking you all down.

366
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,387
[ZORO]
The entire World Government.

367
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,561
[JABRA] Why don't you just
run around screaming

368
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,230
and crying like you did earlier?

369
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,698
You were great at that!

370
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,667
[NAMI]
Please! Don't kill, Usopp!

371
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,302
[JABRA]
He's first and you're next!

372
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:23,671
This is the end! It's over!

373
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,272
[NAMI]
Leave him alone!

374
00:23:25,305 --> 00:23:27,141
What? No way!

375
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,577
[JABRA]
Who the hell are you?

376
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,211
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

377
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,280
"Hunter Sanji Makes an Entrance?

378
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,015
Elegy for a Lying Wolf."

379
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,450
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
