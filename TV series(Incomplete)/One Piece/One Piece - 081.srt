Well, we're in pretty bad
shape if you're not sure.

You know, if Luffy and Sanji
manage to make it to the castle,

105
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,434
and the doctor isn't there,

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,202
they'll just turn
around and leave.

107
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,371
We have to make it to
the place, find the doctor,

108
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,073
and tell her to go back
up the mountain!

At any rate, if we
keep to this route,

00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,341
[VILLAGERS gasp]

173
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,811
[WAPOL yells]
He cut me! I'm gonna die!

174
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,213
[VILLAGER A]
It's Dalton!

175
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,547
I came to see you dead,

176
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,350
so that really
suits me just fine.

177
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,419
[CHESS]
Dalton, you bastard!

178
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,588
It's a shame that
you're still alive.

179
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,356
You just injured your own king.

180
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,191
He shouldn't be
difficult to fix.

181
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,560
After all, we live in an
advanced medical nation

182
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,762
with almost two dozen
well qualified doctors

183
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,397
to service his every need.

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,532
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:23,102
Twenty MDs Emergency Medical
Unit, prepare! Heal him!

186
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,170
[DOCTOR 1]
Start operation.

187
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:24,904
[DOCTOR 2]
Start operation.

188
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,872
[DOCTOR 3]
Start operation.

189
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,173
[DOCTOR 4]
Start operation.

190
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,907
[DOCTOR 5]
Start operation.

191
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,108
[DOCTOR 6]
Start operation.

192
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,243
[DOCTOR 7]
Start operation.

193
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:30,743
[DOCTOR 1]
Scalpel.

194
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,244
[DOCTOR 2]
Needle.

195
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:31,911
[DOCTOR 3]
Tin.

196
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,746
[DOCTOR 4]
And hammer.

197
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,583
Wow! I was sure I was
gonna die for a minute there!

198
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,752
This is a perfect example
of our situation.

199
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,854
You receive all the medical
attention that you could

200
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,556
possibly need
while your citizens

201
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,759
have to suffer without
a doctor. It's wrong!

202
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,731
It's wrong? Show some respect.
I am still your king, Dalton.

203
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,934
He's right. you'll shut yo' mouf
if you know what's good for you.

204
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,603
The three of us, including you,
were in the highest position

205
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,205
among Wapol's men.

206
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,541
We were his loyal servants,
or have you forgotten?

207
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,609
[DALTON grunts]
I haven't forgotten.

208
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,945
It's true that while you were
making our people suffer,

209
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,314
all I could do was stand there
as one of Wapol's men

210
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,383
and watch as you
ruined our country.

211
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,718
I have to accept
responsibility for that.

212
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,955
So, Wapol, Let's leave
this country together.

213
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,158
We can't stay in the land
we betrayed any longer.

214
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,961
No, Dalton, wait!
You didn't do anything wrong!

215
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,297
He's right! You're the only
one in the government

216
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,299
who tried to protect us.
You're the only one who

217
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,634
fought for us while he was
destroying the kingdom!

218
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,835
You stood up for us!

219
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,238
[WAPOL] Hah! You should
have died, Dalton,

220
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,641
in your post as captain of the
Drum Kingdom security guard.

221
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,677
I don't know how you all
survived in this country

222
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,945
without any doctors.

223
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,913
Our country is
internationally acknowledged

224
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,014
for its development
in medicine,

225
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,418
but that renown is nothing
more than a cheap charade.

226
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,853
No one could guess that there
are actually only 20 doctors

227
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,690
who are shut up doing research
in the king's own lab.

228
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,792
And that all the other
doctors have been exiled

229
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,860
from the country,
leaving the citizens to suffer.

230
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,631
Yes. Anyone who gets sick or
injured must come and beg

231
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,633
for their life if
they want help.

232
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,667
And if I feel like it,

233
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,870
maybe I'll lend them
the Twenty MD's services.

234
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,672
If they want to stay
alive and healthy,

235
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,875
all they have to do is
obey me, their king!

236
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,511
This way, no one will
dare challenge my rule.

237
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,814
And that is the perfect
way to govern a country.

238
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,349
This isn't real
governing, Wapol,

239
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,617
and you aren't a real king!

240
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,953
Heh. Well, you certainly
speak your mind, Dalton.

241
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,957
Now, kill him! I want you
to shoot your former captain!

242
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,860
As usual, you don't
understand a thing I'm saying.

243
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,832
[growls]

244
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,467
I served your
father before you,

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,902
and he was always a good
man and a fair ruler.

246
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,971
I hoped you might come
to resemble him one day,

247
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,741
but I see now that that was
a lot of wishful thinking.

248
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,909
Not good! He's using
the Ox‐Ox Fruit.

249
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,746
He's in his Bison form!

250
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,682
Don't back down!
Just fire!

251
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,351
[DALTON grunts]

252
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,352
[SOLDIER 4]
We can't hit 'em!

253
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,553
[SOLDIER 5]
He just dodges!

254
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,590
[DALTON] No mercy,
even to my ex‐soldiers!

255
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,427
Fiddle Bam! Attacking!

256
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,332
[SOLDIERS shouting]

257
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,438
[VILLAGER A]
Amazing! He's so powerful!

258
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,773
[VILLAGER K]
So this is the kind of power

259
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,841
the Zoan‐type devil
fruit will give?

260
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,909
[DALTON]
Enough!

261
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,844
I've had it with you pathetic,
so‐called rulers.

262
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,946
There can be no hope for a
country where the king and his

263
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,748
men are the first ones
to abandon the people

264
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,383
during a time of crisis.

265
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,586
Let's see how well you do
fighting against the two of us.

266
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,722
Just give up.

267
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,091
[VILLAGER 1]
Dalton!

268
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,359
[VILLAGER 2]
Dalton, wait!

269
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,293
[VILLAGER 3]
We've come to help you!

270
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,395
[VILLAGER 4]
Please let us fight with you!

271
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,631
[VILLAGER 5] We're going
to protect our country!

272
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,036
Remember, I've known
you a long time.

273
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,806
[DALTON grunts]

274
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,875
And I know you well.

275
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:50,876
No, don't!

276
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,312
I know what your
weaknesses are.

277
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,781
[CHESS chuckles]

278
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,920

[DALTON groans]

281
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,626
[VILLAGER 1]
Oh, no!

282
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,794
[VILLAGER 2] Why did you
shield us from that shot?

283
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,495
[VILLAGER 3]
Dalton!

284
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,397
Not Dalton!

285
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,966
[grunts]

286
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,235
[VILLAGER I]
Are you all right?

287
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,838
[CHESS] I told you I knew
where your weak spot was.

288
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,006
Nice guys always finish last.

289
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,807
[KUROMARIMO]
Heh!

290
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,477
Quite the fitting death,
huh, boys?

291
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,446
[WAPOL laughs]

292
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,781
[VILLAGER B gasps]
What's that?

293
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,917
Is... that a... earthquake?

294
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,154
[USOPP]
This doesn't look good.

295
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,790
We won't be able to go any
further in this deep snow.

296
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,593
[VIVI] It seems like we've gone
partially up the mountain.

297
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,129
[USOPP]
Uh...

298
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,497
[VIVI]
What's this?

299
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,499
Why is the ground shaking?

300
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,601
[VIVI gasps]
Oh no, Usopp!

301
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,136
Is this what I think it is?

302
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:54,607
[USOPP whimpers]
An... avalanche!

303
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,876
[ZORO] Twenty‐five thousand,
six‐hundred and thirty‐one.

304
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,010
Thirty‐two.

305
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,780
Twenty‐five thousand,
six‐hundred and thirty‐three.

306
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,784
[ZORO gasps] What's goin' on?
What's all that rumbling?

307
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,554
[ZORO grunts]

308
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,025

00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,350
No! We aren't up high enough!

312
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:43,589
[SANJI, LUFFY yell]

313
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,030
This isn't good! now what?

314
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh right! I know!

315
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,936
[yells]

316
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,206
Sanji! Grab a hold!

317
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,008
[SANJI]
Thanks for that, Luffy.

318
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,010
Yeah, sure, but what now?

319
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,612
Even if we don't
sink in this snow,

320
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,380
we're just gonna keep
flying down this mountain

321
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,249
unless we do something about it.

322
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,285
[SANJI] No way! I'm never
gonna let that happen.

323
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,386
We've come all this way,

324
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,355
and we were almost to
the base of the mountain,

325
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,791
just feet away from the doctor!

326
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,894
[SANJI] Luffy! You need
to come up with a way

327
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,629
to stop all this right now.

328
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,231
It's all because of
those damn bunnies!

329
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,232
Next time I see them,

330
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,634
I'm gonna turn them
into a big bowl of stew!

331
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,370
[LUFFY] Ooh, Rabbit stew?!
That sounds good!

332
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,073

00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,382
[LUFFY]
What do we do?!

335
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,785
The only thing that we
can do at the moment.

336
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,954
Slide faster!

337
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,424
[SANJI]
What is their problem?!

338
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,727
Seriously!

up in that direction, right?

You told me earlier that
some of the Straw Hats

headed up the mountain toward
my castle, isn't that right?

They have a

about what happened.

Those sinister Straw Hat
pirates caused the avalanche?!
