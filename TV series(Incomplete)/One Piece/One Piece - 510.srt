the brave country that
fought against the whole world.

175
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,687
And now that we've
finally found you,

176
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,257
we will shield you from
the Government at all costs!

177
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,358
Those are our boss's orders.

178
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,594
Boss?

179
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,966
The leader of our army, Dragon.

180
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,900
[gasps]

181
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,702
[ROBIN]
Luffy's father.

182
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:10,237
[chuckles]

183
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,139
Fate is strange sometimes.

184
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,173
Huh?

185
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,410
[BUNNY JOE]
Once again, I implore you--

186
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,280
Would you please let us
introduce you to our boss?

187
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,181
I'll take you to him myself.

188
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,482
[ROBIN]
I can't.

189
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,919
There's somewhere I have
to return to immediately.

190
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,222
Besides, I don't need
you to look out for me.

191
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,527
After all, I have my friends.

192
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,396
[BUNNY JOE]
I assume you're talking about

193
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,964
the Straw Hat Pirates.

194
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,298
[ROBIN]
Yes.

195
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,700
[BUNNY JOE] Then at least let
us carry you part of the way.

196
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,171
The bridge we're on,
it's incredibly long.

197
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,974
You can walk for days
and not see the end.

198
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,478
I insist, wherever you're
going, let us help you.

199
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:51,645
[REVOLUTIONARY E]
Sorry to interrupt, sir,

200
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,913
but I have good news!

201
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,214
It looks like we'll be able

202
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,984
to unlock the third and fourth
prisons before much longer!

203
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,118
[BUNNY JOE]
Roger that.

204
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,020
In the meantime, make
sure we have a team ready

205
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,788
in case they're
injured or confused.

206
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,923
[REVOLUTIONARY E]
Sir!

207
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:04,958
Please, tell me something.

208
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,194
Absolutely.

209
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,328
It's about your army.

210
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,698
You seem to need me and
I would like to know why.

211
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,166
[BUNNY JOE]
All right then.

212
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,270
[BUNNY JOE] Between here
and the end of the bridge,

213
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,139
you'll notice a lot
of ghost towns.

214
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,209
[BUNNY JOE] That's because
the whole country relocated

215
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,678
while the construction
was going on.

216
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:28,615
For example, that one there
is from 300 years ago.

217
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,985
Then why would
they keep building?

218
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,454
As always, because
the World Nobles ordered it.

219
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,923
[ROBIN]
I see.

220
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,392
But honestly,
the reasons don't matter.

221
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,927
That doesn't justify the deaths

222
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,929
of those who've been enslaved
here. It's all the same.

223
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,569
[REVOLUTIONARY A] Hey,
Dragon's kid, Straw Hat Luffy,

224
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,238
was in the newspaper today.
Did you see it?

225
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,540
[REVOLUTIONARY B]
Yeah, he's nuts.

226
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,041
Goes missing after the war,

227
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,911
then pops up again to do
something crazy like this.

228
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,645
Either way, we should
show this article

229
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,481
to Nico Robin as soon as we can.

230
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,950
She's been worried
sick about Straw Hat.

231
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,317
[REVOLUTIONARY A]
Sure, but I don't think

232
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,387
they've made it to
the end of the bridge yet.

233
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,223
Oh, thanks for the newspaper.

234
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,125
--[BUNNY JOE] This is for you.
--[ROBIN gasps]

235
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,529
Luffy!

236
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,199
Oh, good. He's safe.

237
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,566
[gasps]

238
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:22,770
What? Is everything all right?

239
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,872
Hard to tell whether you're
shocked or amused over there.

240
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:28,642
Both.

241
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,113
[NARRATOR] Now we take
you to Kamabakka Kingdom,

242
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,416
a pastel-colored paradise
on Peachy Island

243
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:12,018
where the New Kamas reside.

244
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,459
Come on! Really?

245
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,261
I told you to give me a ship!

246
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,731
I have a promise
I'm supposed to keep, dammit!

247
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,298
There's no time
for me to goof around

248
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,634
with you guys
anymore, all right?

249
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,169
Try a bit harder, Candy Boy!

250
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,038
That's obviously an excuse
to escape this island!

251
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,473
We're not letting you go!

252
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,008
[SANJI]
So, what if it is an excuse?

253
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,843
I'll come right out and say it!

254
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,212
If I don't see
some pretty girls,

255
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,847
I'm gonna shrivel up and die!

256
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,783
In case you haven't noticed,
this isn't my scene.

257
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,651
Could that be who I think it is?

258
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:45,819
[QUEENS]
Huh?

259
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,156
[QUEEN D]
Oh my god, it is!

260
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,191
Queen Iva is on that boat!

261
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,961
[QUEENS screaming]

262
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,965
Huh? Why do we care?

263
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,266
[CAROLINE whimpering]

264
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,469
Jeez, control yourself. Whoever
he is can't be that special.

265
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,804
[CAROLINE] She is the
ruler of our kingdom...

266
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,309
Queen Emporio Ivankov!

267
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,777
Ivankov? Hold up.

268
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,557
[SANJI] That's the queen
I read about in the paper.

269
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,159
Talk about good timing.

270
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,493
She was traveling with Luffy,

271
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,195
so she's gotta know
something useful about him.

272
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,000
[gasps]

273
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,072
[IVANKOV]
Ah, home sweet home.

274
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,474
Whoa, it's my lucky day!

275
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,244
Wh-What a body!

276
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,946
No. I can't.

277
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,015
She's totally a dude
under all that hotness,

278
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,850
otherwise she wouldn't
be on this island.

279
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,218
I'm not gonna fall for it!

280
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,452
Huh?

281
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,588
Hey there, you got a name?

282
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,590
Uh, I, uh...

283
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,091
[gasps]

284
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,193
[SANJI]
Her boobs are a perfect ten,

285
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,496
and her butt's nice
and tight, too!

286
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,698
No! You're not
gonna win me over.

287
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,402
[IVANKOV] Is there
anything I can do for you,

288
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,471
Candy Boy?

289
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,907
Yeah! I've got a lot
of questions for you, buddy,

290
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,777
and the first one is
are you single?

291
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,513
Uh, I mean, it's about Luffy.

292
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,481
What? Luffy?

293
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:23,517
You mean the cutie
with the straw hat?

294
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,451
Bingo!

295
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,086
Listen, I just read in the paper

296
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,589
that you were busting heads
with him at Marineford.

297
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,557
Ahh, Luffy, you lucky bastard!

298
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,027
Anyway, you might
know how he's doing.

299
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,431
So, I was hoping you would
fill me in on that, baby.

300
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,665
[IVANKOV]
Huh?

301
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:43,571
[IVANKOV giggles]

302
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,671
[gasps]

303
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,542
How about no?

304
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:51,578
Aw, man! And I saw it coming
from a mile away, too!

305
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,779
Screw you!

306
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,116
Too bad! Now tell me,
how do you know Straw Boy?

307
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,417
We're shipmates.

308
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,086
Huh? You're a part of his crew?

309
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,460
[IVANKOV] So, Straw Boy
here is your captain?

310
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,462
[SANJI]
Yeah, so?

311
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,931
[IVANKOV] Then you're friends
with Pirate Hunter Zoro?

312
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,366
No!

313
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,268
[IVANKOV]
And what about Cat Burglar Nami?

314
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,603
[SANJI gasping]

315
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,504
[IVANKOV]
Are you familiar with

316
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,439
the King of Snipers
pictured here?

317
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,175
Yup.

318
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,076
And this one... is you?

319
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,244
Hell, no!

320
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,846
[IVANKOV] You're not on
any of these wanted posters,

321
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,181
so you must be a fraud!

322
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,783
Sorry, but I have yet to see

323
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,151
proof of your relationship
with Straw Boy!

324
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,120
What do I have to do
to convince you?

325
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,554
Tell me what you
know about Luffy,

326
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,491
you fishnet-wearing
freak show! Now!

327
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,293
It says right here
in this newspaper

328
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,295
that you were there with him!

329
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,163
[IVANKOV]
So, you admit this is you.

330
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,431
[SANJI]
No, it's not!

331
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,333
[SANJI gasps]

332
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,668
[SANJI]
I mean, kind of, but...

333
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:52,540
I'm Sanji, but I...

334
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,773
[coughs]

335
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,046
Gosh, this is a problem
area for you, isn't it?

336
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,715
[SANJI panting]

337
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,051
[SANJI coughs]
All right.

338
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,986
Fine! It's me!

339
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,589
That hideous thing on
the wanted poster is me!

340
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:09,423
You win!

341
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,557
Now--

342
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:13,894
[SANJI groans]

343
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,430
Nope. No match!

344
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,332
But you still made me say it?!

345
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,768
I was coughing up
blood, you jerk!

346
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,702
Too bad for you,
because if there's even

347
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,238
an infinitesimal
fraction of a chance

348
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,508
that you're a puppet for
the Navy or the Government,

349
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,277
I won't be divulging
one iota of the information

350
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,812
I have about Straw Boy.

351
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,281
Certainly, you can
understand why.

352
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,084
[SANJI] Yeah, I get it.
At least let me borrow a ship.

353
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,020
I've gotta get to the meeting
spot as soon as I can.

354
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:41,688
No ship for you!

355
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,557
[SANJI] All right, then.
I'll start swimming!

356
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,660
[gasps] Such awesome dedication!

357
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:47,928
You were telling the truth

358
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,364
when you said that you
were a member of his crew!

359
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,966
Well, in that case,
I have no choice.

360
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,234
You moved me,

361
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,337
so out of respect for your
undying devotion to Straw Boy,

362
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:59,140
I'll tell you everything.

363
00:18:59,173 --> 00:19:00,273
[gasps]

364
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,511
Or maybe not!

365
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,712
Hee-haw!

366
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:07,013
[QUEEN E]
You had me going!

367
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:08,349
[QUEEN F]
What a trickster!

368
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:09,684
[QUEEN G]
You're so smart!

369
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,585
Nobody asked you morons!

370
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,287
[SANJI groaning]

371
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,656
[SANJI]
Damn it.

372
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,991
Ooh, looks like
his guard's down.

373
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:22,162
Nice! Maybe we can get him into
that darling dress from before!

374
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,765
Not even if you
paid me! Now back off!

375
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:29,236
Listen! I'm a manly man
who likes ladies! Sexy ones!

376
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,639
Hear me? And none of
you creeps make the cut!

377
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,742
[QUEENS]
Boo! Boo!

378
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,645
Hey, Iva, I think it was?

379
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,616
I decided since I'm a pirate,
I'm gonna take your ship.

380
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,185
I challenge you to a duel.

381
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,754
All right.

382
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:48,655
[QUEEN H]
And now, Queen Iva,

383
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,224
the grand master
of New Kama Kenpo,

384
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,760
will face Black Leg Sanji

385
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:55,296
in a three minute,
winner take all match!

386
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,498
[IVANKOV giggles]

387
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,534
[SANJI] Judging by how
strong his stand-in was,

388
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,736
he's probably gonna be tough.

389
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,072
I gotta warn you,
I won't hold back.

390
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,607
[QUEEN H]
Fight!

391
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,108
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe!

392
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:09,209
[yelling]

393
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,179
[SANJI]
Premier Hachis!

394
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,548
[IVANKOV groans]

395
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,285
[IVANKOV groaning]

396
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,988
My! You're powerful!

397
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,556
I don't think I can resist!

398
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,825
I'm beginning to falter.

399
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:29,229
I do believe this
is the end. Here I go.

400
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,097
Not!

401
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,431
[SANJI grunts]

402
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:34,068
[IVANKOV]
Hee-haw!

403
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,704
[QUEENS] Aw, you got us again!
You're such a kidder!

404
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,739
[SANJI grunts]

405
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,440
[IVANKOV] You appear
to be a sturdy fellow,

406
00:20:40,474 --> 00:20:44,745
but I dare say you could benefit
from some serious discipline.

407
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:47,180
--What?
--New Kama Kenpo,

408
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,383
44th Aesthetic Technique!

409
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,952
I call it my Hair Removal Fist!

410
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:54,955
--[SANJI gasps]
--[IVANKOV yelling]

411
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,456
[IVANKOV]
Death Wink!

412
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,291
[SANJI groans]

413
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,992
[IVANKOV]
Hell Wink!

414
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,127
[SANJI groans]

415
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:02,229
[IVANKOV]
Galaxy Wink!

416
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,197
[SANJI groans]

417
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,470
[IVANKOV chuckles]

418
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:16,142
[SANJI groaning]

419
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,079
[IVANKOV]
Very well, Mister Curly-Brows,

420
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,949
I'll give you an
update on Straw Boy.

421
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,751
So, what made you change
your tune all of a sudden?

422
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,253
[IVANKOV]
Oh, please.

423
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,189
There's no need to hide what
the whole world knows anyway.

424
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:32,025
What's going through that
little guy's head, I wonder?

425
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,194
[SANJI]
It's in today's paper?

426
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,396
[gasps] Whoa!

427
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,732
You've got a call from Baltigo.

428
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:39,734
Oh?

429
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,469
The boss is waiting.
Please come with me.

430
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,505
[IVANKOV] Goodness, everyone
seems to have learned

431
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:48,575
a great deal about you since
the war haven't they, Dragon?

432
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:52,379
That must have been very
upsetting for your men.

433
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,982
[DRAGON] Hah. Actually,
they were happy to find out

434
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:58,552
their mysterious boss didn't
have a heart of stone after all.

435
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,588
Well, it doesn't make any
difference now, does it?

436
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,890
Luffy's not a kid anymore.

437
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:07,027
Regardless, I was surprised to
hear you were there with him.

438
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:11,364
[IVANKOV] Destiny sure works in
interesting ways, huh? [giggles]

439
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,534
As for myself, it's been
one twist after another.

440
00:22:14,568 --> 00:22:15,669
What with the prison break

441
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,504
and meeting your
little bundle of joy.

442
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,607
Needless to say, I have
several questions to ask you.

443
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,142
I'm sure you do.

444
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,611
The time has come for us to
call our commanders from

445
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,514
every corner of the world
as quickly as possible.

446
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,084
Now that Whitebeard is dead,
the Government regime

447
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,186
and the world's situation
are going to change.

448
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,289
Not only that,
but it occurs to me

449
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:38,058
I haven't gotten to tell
you what happened to Kuma.

450
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:41,462
[IVANKOV] Yes, that certainly
was a nasty surprise.

451
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,397
Working for the
Government is bad enough,

452
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,632
but now robot clones?

453
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,502
I still can't believe
he tried to do me in!

454
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,705
I suppose the Kuma
we once knew is no more.

455
00:22:52,906 --> 00:22:56,143
[IVANKOV] By the way, Dragon,
have you seen today's news?

456
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:59,546
Straw Boy's thrown me
for a loop yet again!

457
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,249
He's just as wild as his father.

458
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:06,153
He seems to be relaying
some kind of message,

459
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,822
and in Marineford, no less.

460
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,363
[NARRATOR] Although Navy
Headquarters was left in ruins

461
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,631
after the War of the Best,

462
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:20,801
marines and reporters
still stalk its grounds.

463
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,869
Luffy, Rayleigh,
and Jimbei return

464
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:26,107
to where Ace lost his life
to carry out a mysterious plan.

465
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,407
The world is shocked,

466
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,976
but will Luffy's crew
understand his actions?

467
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,812
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

468
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:35,449
"Unexpected Relanding!
Luffy, to Marineford!"

469
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:38,051
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
