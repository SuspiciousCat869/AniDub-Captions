there too. Right, Kin?

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:50.229
Yes, Indeed!

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:51.530
[KIN'EMON shouts]

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:55.868
One of my comrades is there,
held prisoner by our foe.

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.570
[CREW]
Huh?!

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:20.960
Huh?

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.829
Take heed. Stormy skies
are upon us now.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:24.663
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.732
Wow, those clouds're
pretty intense.

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:29.602
Perhaps we should all go inside.

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.203
[SANJI]
Hm?

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:32.972
Wow, yeah. It's hail.

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:37.610
[ROBIN]
Goodness.

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:39.745
Wait a sec.

00:14:39.778 --> 00:14:40.946
[CHOPPER gasps]

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.950
[CHOPPER]
Nami!

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:48.120
What's up? Is the weather
about to get crazy?

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.391
[NAMI]
Franky, prepare a Coup de Burst!

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.760
[FRANKY]
Any time, any place, sister!

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:57.162
Somebody, take the helm for me!

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:58.130
[USOPP]
Looks like I'm up!

00:14:58.163 --> 00:15:00.099
[CHOPPER]
We gotta furl the sails, quick!

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.434
[MOMONOSUKE, KIN'EMON]
Hm...? Hm?

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:05.738
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:08.974
Trouble seems to find us
wherever we go, doesn't it?

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:20.686
Now, hard to port! With a
Coup de Burst towards 9 o'clock!

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.888
Aim for the spot with no clouds!

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.690
[USOPP]
You got it!

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.895
Huh?

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.106
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.476
Not like this! I'm far
too talented to die!

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.013
[FRANKY]
Coup... de... Burst!

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.322
[LUFFY]
Wa-hoo!

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.291
[cheers]
That was close!

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.400
[MOMONOSUKE, KIN'EMON]
H-Huh?

00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.269
We've taken to the sky!

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:20.913
[USOPP]
And that's how you do it!

00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:22.381
[CHOPPER]
Nice work, you guys!

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.216
[SANJI]
Everyone, thank Nami!

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.951
[CAESAR CLOWN]
To think I almost persished

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.186
with you imbeciles!

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.221
[CREW cheers]

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.123
[LUFFY] Aw man, I love
it when that happens.

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:34.493
That was fun, huh, Momo?
This stuff happens all the time!

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.995
[MOMONOSUKE gasps]

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.831
Th-That was extraordinary!

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:41.367
[FRANKY chuckles] The Sunny
here was built to impress,

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.736
so I'm glad it meets
your approval, Little Bro.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.671
[FRANKY grunts]
Isn't it super?

00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:47.906
[MOMONOSUKE, KIN'EMON] I concur,
this vessel is quite super!

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.809
Hey Momo. How about a
tour of the inside, too?

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:51.910
I'd love to show you.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:55.214
[MOMONOSUKE] Hm! Would you?
I shall allow it, then.

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:57.883
I... failed to notice that you
had become human once more!

00:16:57.916 --> 00:16:59.852
[NAMI chuckels]
C'mon.

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.265
[snores]

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.935
[USOPP]
All right!

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.670
We made it to the
end of the day.

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:27.706
No enemies sighted anywhere!

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:30.609
Sir! No enemies found
on my patrol, either.

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.611
Good work. At ease soldier

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:33.879
Thank you.

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.416
[USOPP growls]

00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.852
Hey! Are we safe yet, or what?

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.753
How many people are
looking for us?

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:43.222
Like, a whole army?

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:44.723
I'm afraid the
second I lay down,

00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.560
Doflamingo's gonna swoop in
and kill me in my sleep!

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.562
He's gonna get all of us killed.

00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:52.297
Kin gave us these cool helmets!

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.266
I bet we're, like,
invincible now!

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:55.968
Resign from the
Warlords of the Sea

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.337
or go to battle with one
of the Four Emperors.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.740
Obviously, he'll pass on both
and come kill us, if he's wise.

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:03.142
[laughs]

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.344
Oh. I'm scared!

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.545
[LUFFY gasps]

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.614
Stop fleeing and face
your punishment,

00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:09.915
you spineless coward!

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:10.749
[ZORO grunts]

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:13.519
[yells]

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.020
[ZORO]
Don't jump to conclusions!

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:16.455
It's complicated!

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.724
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Get away! Ah! Help!

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.192
Would you stop
fighting on the ship?

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.493
You're gonna sink us all!

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.495
Are you guys playing Samurai?

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:24.763
Fight! Fight!

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:28.367
[KIN'EMON] Have you no shame?
The Wano Kingdom's heartbroken!

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.269
The grave of our hero--

00:19:31.703 --> 00:19:32.604
Defiled!

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:34.606
[ZORO] Argh! I told you,
I didn't take it!

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.375
[KIN'EMON] Am I to believe
that our hero Ryuma's

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:39.945
legendary blade, Shusui,
simply fell into your lap!

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:43.382
You're a real pal, samurai!
Cut him in half for me!

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.684
Hey guys. How's a
midnight snack sound?

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:47.519
[CHOPPER, LUFFY]
Awesome! What's on the menu?

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.954
[SANJI]
Pizza.

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:52.524
Pida? I am not familiar
with this dish by name.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:55.327
But if your chef made it,
I'm eager to try.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.462
Did Momonosuke go
to bed already?

00:19:57.496 --> 00:19:59.064
He's taking a bath
with Robin right now.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.966
[MEN]
What?!

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:08.040
[ROBIN] You haven't had a chance
to bathe in days, have you?

00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:09.908
[MOMONOSUKE]
Quite true.

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:13.111
[ROBIN chuckles]
Are you all nice and warm now?

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.581
[MOMONOSUKE]
Indeed. Most relaxing!

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.118
[MEN panting]

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.289
[MEN growl]

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.358
[ROBIN]
Oh, perfect timing!

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.461
Kin'emon, he needs
some clothes, if you would.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:30.929
[MOMONOSUKE sighs]

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:34.366
[MEN] What are grinning about,
you dirty little brat?!

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.834
[gasps]

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:41.173
We can see right through
that act of yours.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:44.676
You think you can get away with
this, just cause you're a kid?

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.979
You must now cut off
your topknot in shame!

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:51.250
[whimpers]

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.353
[MEN groan]

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:58.223
Hey! Why are you ganging up
on a child, you jerks?

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:03.562
He's a man in his heart.
Do not let him fool you, Nami!

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:07.032
[MOMONOSUKE] Save me from
their barbarism, princess!

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.500
You think I'm a princess?

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:11.003
Well, I won't disagree!

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:13.972
Aw, you're such a good boy!

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.608
You sleep with me
and Robin tonight.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.378
[MEN] No! Their bedroom
is a secret garden!

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.545
You don't get to go!

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:23.348
[MOMONOSUKE giggles]

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:29.921
[MEN] What? You're a filthy
little devil, I knew it!

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:55.080
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:58.717
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A]
Click.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:02.688
[DUGONG A murmurs]

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:06.391
[BREED] Oh, really?
You found the Straw Hats?

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:19.171
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
race towards the island

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:22.507
of Dressrosa when, suddenly,
a mysterious foe attacks.

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:25.777
Luffy and Law swing into action
only to discover defeating their

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.046
opponent is more difficult
than they imagined.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.750
Little do they know a surprising
reunion soon awaits them!

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.518
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.087
"Caesar Goes Missing!

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.589
The Pirate Alliance
Makes a Sortie!"

00:22:37.622 --> 00:22:40.292
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
