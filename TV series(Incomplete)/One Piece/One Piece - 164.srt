[GOLD ROGER] The world.

Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,055

[NARRATOR B] After stepping foot
on Upper Yard's Lost Forest,

32
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:36,938
Luffy, Sanji, and Usopp
braved the random and vicious

33
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:40,692
Ordeal of Spheres unleashed
by the priest Satori.

34
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,236
[NARRATOR B]
On the other side of the island,

35
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,240
the Sky Knight Gan Fall was
defeated by Priest Shura.

36
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:49,701
[CHOPPER]
I'll save you!

37
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,788
[ZORO]
Hey, Nami!

38
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,459
Can you see anything up there?

39
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,794
[SATORI]
It's you! Get off me!

40
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,088
How are you still alive?

41
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,090
[SANJI]
So I'm proposing this.

42
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:07,469
Ordeal of love.

43
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,929
Then, you must brutally
and without hesitation

44
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:12,182
tenderize the meat.

[WYPER]
So Gan Fall, the former God,

00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:28,365
made his way into
the Upper Yard alone.

50
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:32,577
This will not sit
well with Eneru.

51
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,413
You think Gan Fall's trying
to take back what he lost?

52
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:36,790
No way.

53
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,000
That old fart's never had
the guts to try before.

54
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,669
Why would he now?

What's the matter, Aisa?

59
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,979
Two voices. They're gone.

Huh? Your Mantra?

00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,070
Yes. It just happened.

[WYPER growls]

64
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,700
You're saying that
you heard two voices

65
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:13,535
and then they
disappeared suddenly?

66
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,495
You need to be honest with me.

67
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:16,996
Is this true?

68
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,499
[AISA exhales]

69
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,251
I assume that's 'yes.'

70
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,252
We should believe her.

71
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:23,503
Ever since she was born,

72
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,505
she has been able to use
her ability of Mantra

73
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:28,425
to sense people, even those
who are far away from her.

74
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:31,386
There's no mistaking her gift.

75
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:32,721
You sure you don't hear them?

76
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:33,805
They're not there anymore?

77
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:36,850
Yeah. I think it's stopped.

78
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:38,351
But...

79
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,562
It seemed like Gan Fall was
fighting a priest and they--

80
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:41,438
Killed each other?

81
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,231
Nicely done, old man.

82
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,816
There're only three left now.

83
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,901
Which is good for us.

84
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,907
I guess Heaven's actually
answered our prayers.

85
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,536
It's time for us to crush those
priests once and for all.

86
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:58,246
Yeah!

00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,706

Wyper still makes you
nervous, doesn't he?

92
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:11,468
You have to grow up
sooner or later.

94
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:17,724

What is it?

96
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,394
It wasn't Gan Fall who
defeated that priest!

97
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,146
There are others on
that side of the island

98
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,856
and they're the
ones that did it!

99
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,358
[LAKI]
Other people?

100
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,444
You mean the ones who entered
Skypeia from the Blue Sea?

101
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,781
I don't know who,
but they're really scary to me.

102
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,074
So...

00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,160
...be careful.

[LAKI]
I'll try.

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,751
Now be a good girl
and hand over your bag.

[AISA]
No! I can't!

00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:49,297
This is my special secret bag!
It has treasure in it!

109
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,383
I know that.

00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:53,051
[AISA groans]

111
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:56,513
And it will have even more
inside when I bring it back.

--Yeah?
--Yeah.

shut up any sooner.

by a guy who looks like that.

116
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:11,695
At least he had
some neat tricks,

117
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,572

before we even knew them.

something about the boat.

125

Kick it into gear!

[LUFFY]
Ha! Usopp, you're my hero!

all your heroes like that?

135
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:58,950
[LUFFY]
I don't think so.

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,582
I'm surprised you
pulled this off.

00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,526
[SANJI] I will never
let you forget this.

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,944
You know...

153
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,406
...I could've stretched my
arm and grabbed the boat.

154
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,409
[USOPP] Look, we're on the
boat and out of the forest.

155
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,869
That's all that matters.

Oh, yeah. I can't swim.

158
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,433
[CHOPPER]
The Sky Knight...

159
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:08,853
[CHOPPER]
And his weird bird, too,

160
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:12,107
who also has the power
of the Devil Fruit.

161
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,611
[CHOPPER]
I couldn't do it.

162
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,822
I couldn't save anyone.

163
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,750
[CHOPPER]
This is it.

164
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,545
I can feel myself slipping away.

00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,549
[GEDATSU]
Satori has fallen.

166
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,384
Losing control over his Mantra

167
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:42,262
only shows his
inexperience with it.

168
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:45,390
It seems the intruders this
time are from the Blue Sea,

169
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,600
but they behave strangely.

170
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,854
The sacrifices are now
moving around freely as well.

171
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:53,106
However, even if we
leave them alone,

172
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,316
they won't find their
way off this island.

173
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,987
More importantly...

00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,330
[HOLY THE DOG panting]

[OHM] Do you hear the voice
of a sorrowful warrior, Holy?

176
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,169
[woofs]

177
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,338
[OHM] It doesn't matter how
many times we walk this road.

178
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,340
Things always end the same.

179
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:22,218
Shura defeated Gan Fall, but the
Ordeal of Spheres was broken.

180
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,347
That's where luck will end
for our new challengers.

181
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,975
For them to attempt to see God
is insolence at its greatest,

182
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,643
and their punishment at my hands

183
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:34,314
will have things a bit unsettled
this evening in the Upper Yard.

184
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,693
{\an8}No one here gets out alive.

185
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:40,445
{\an8}[FUZA screeches]

186
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,448
{\an8}[SHURA] The ones who escaped
sacrifice are off my list.

187
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,367
{\an8}It seems there are
others roaming around

188
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,161
{\an8}who are more worthy of my anger!

189
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,437
All of you, listen up!

190
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,565
Today we catch Upper Yard
at her most vulnerable.

191
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,568
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

192
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,820
We move full speed ahead

193
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,447
and don't stop until
we reach God's Shrine!

194
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:26,616
And do not fear Eneru!

195
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,869
The Great Warrior Kalgara
is our one and only savior!

196
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,996
Only to him are we true!

197
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,126
[WYPER]
Braham!

198
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:36,960
Ready!

199
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:37,794
[WYPER]
Kamakiri!

200
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:38,837
[KAMAKIRI]
Hmph.

201
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,838
[WYPER]
Genbou!

202
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:40,714
[grunts]

203
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,798
[WYPER]
Laki!

204
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:42,924
Right.

205
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:43,925
[WYPER]
Be careful.

206
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,510
We split up here.

207
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,017
[WYPER] We vow to the
Great Warrior Kalgara

208
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,310
to light the fire of Shandora!

209
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,980
[SHANDORIAN WARRIORS cheer]

210
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:01,818
[GEDATSU, OHM, SHURA]
So the Shandorian's

211
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,570
have come for a fight?

212
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,123
No... It couldn't be.

213
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,227
[explosions]

214
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:38,521
[ZORO]
Hm?

215
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,983
Uh, guys?

216
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,568
[ZORO]
That sounded like an explosion.

217
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:44,778
[ROBIN]
I thought I heard some earlier,

218
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,613
but this one seemed bigger.

219
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:51,493
[gasps] Well, either way, we
have to keep moving forward.

220
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:52,952
[ZORO grunts]

221
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,746
Are you in some
kind of hurry, Nami?

222
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,123
You've been acting
odd for some time.

223
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,166
What did you see?

224
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,919
[ZORO]
Please tell me it wasn't God.

225
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,462
It wasn't.

226
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:06,925
If I explained it, you still
wouldn't understand--[screams]

227
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:09,678
[panting]

228
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,929
This is so stupid!

229
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,931
Why can't I just
stay on my feet?

230
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:14,766
You said we should go this way.

231
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,601
Something about it being faster.

232
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,852
Enough with the mystery, Nami!

233
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,605
Spit it out!
Tell us what you saw!

234
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,857
[NAMI] Quit ordering me around
and just do what I say!

235
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:26,111
We have to get to the
seashore--[screams]

236
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:28,113
Would one of you please help me?

237
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,239
[ZORO]
You're the leader.

238
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,990
Why don't you help yourself?

239
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:31,991
The seashore?

240
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:33,159
[NAMI]
Yes.

241
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:34,452
It's the only way we
can get close enough

242
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,871
to check this thing out.

243
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:39,207
[ZORO yelling]

244
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,542
'Cause to be honest,

245
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,586
I won't believe what I saw
until I see it up close.

246
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,171
--[ROBIN] Me, too.
--Huh?

247
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:47,590
[ROBIN] It's been bothering
me for a while now.

248
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,801
[NAMI yelps]

249
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:52,512
But I still can't
prove anything yet.

250
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,055
[NAMI]
Huh?

251
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,891
[ROBIN] Of course a theory is
only a theory until proven.

252
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:59,436
But if what I dreamed up
turns out to be true,

253
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,354
it would be interesting.

254
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:03,064
Very interesting.

255
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,401
The one thing I
always wanted in life

256
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,945
doesn't seem so far
out of reach anymore.

257
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:15,160
Although, it's only a theory.

258
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:24,502
[CHOPPER groans, gasps]

259
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,923
[CHOPPER]
What's going on?

260
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,175
I'm alive!

261
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:33,887
What happened? [pants]

262
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,182
Ow! My neck's killing me!

263
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,184

267
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:48,568
He's alive. That's good.

[sighs]

270
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,827
[CHOPPER] This makes no sense.
I jumped in after him.

271
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,747
I figured we'd
sink to our deaths.

272
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,124
I wonder who could have
pulled us out of there?

273
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,338
[gasps] Hey. What was that?

274
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,174

[ROBIN]
We're almost there.

283
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,070
[ZORO]
Hm?

284
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,030
I can hear the waves
breaking on the shore.

285
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:34,989
Listen.

[waves breaking]

00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:42,789
[NAMI panting]
Yeah! Almost. Almost!

288
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,458
Just a few more steps.

289
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,293
[ZORO] Would you mind
telling me what you saw?

[NAMI cackles]

291
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:50,797
Or at least shut up.

292
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,215
On second thought,

293
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:54,634
I'm hearing more than just
the tide rolling in. You?

294
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:57,554
Yeah. It sounds like
a charging army.

295
00:14:57,637 --> 00:15:00,015
[SHANDORIAN WARRIORS yell]

296
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,814
And some explosions thrown
in for good measure.

297
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:09,274
With any luck,
it's a distraction

298
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:10,567
from what we're doing.

299
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,235
[ROBIN]
Or they're attacking our friend.

300
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,612
[ZORO] Chopper? Aw, he's
tough for bein' so fuzzy.

301
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,698
When the time comes,
he can handle himself.

302
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,283
[ROBIN]
And what about the others?

303
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,826
[ZORO]
You mean Luffy?

304
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:22,287
[ROBIN] He won't sit still after
knowing what happened to us.

305
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,455
[ZORO]
Right. And he's the one

306
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,915
who wanted to come
here to begin with.

307
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,084
[ROBIN] I don't know what this
God has hidden out here,

308
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:31,504
but I doubt he'll let our
captain just walk through.

309
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,173
[ZORO grunts]
Between that, your theory,

310
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:35,925
Nami's mental breakdown,
and this other battle.

311
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,261
[ROBIN] This whole thing has
gotten more complicated.

312
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,846
[ZORO]
That's what I was gonna say.

313
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,390
Anyway, our shipmates are used
to being neck deep in trouble,

314
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,933
so I'm not worried.

315
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,852
Getting bent out of shape over
things that haven't happened

316
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:46,853
is a waste of time.

317
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,855
[ROBIN chuckles]
Good point.

318
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,940
[NAMI groans]

319
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,526
Huh?

320
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:02,911
[ZORO]
Hm?

321
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,330
Nami, wait. Nami!

322
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:08,083
[LUFFY laughs]
Let me do it again.

323
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,501
But this time,
don't make me laugh!

324
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,294
[USOPP laughs]
All right.

325
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:14,172
Zoro, would you wake up already?

326
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,508
Huh? You're a dead man.

327
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:20,720
[USOPP laughs]
That's the best!

328
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:21,638
[USOPP coughs]

329
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,640
This is no time for goofing off!

330
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,308
Nami and Robin are
lost out there

331
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,143
and for all we know they
could be in trouble.

332
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,978
[LUFFY] Zoro and Chopper
are with 'em, you know.

333
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,398
There're three more priests
waiting in the wings.

334
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:33,858
We may have more
challenges ahead of us.

335
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:37,112
--[USOPP laughing]
--[LUFFY] Ordeal of love.

336
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,031
[SANJI groans]

337
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,826
Whatever the case is,
we've got to get to that altar.

338
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,160
Don't you think?

339
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:47,706
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Okay. We're sorry.

340
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:51,084
[panting]

341
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,420
[ROBIN] I wonder why
she took off so fast.

342
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,963
Figures.

343
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:57,507
Sees what she wants and she's
got no problems on her feet.

344
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,804
I was right. It's exactly
what I thought I saw.

345
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,639
[ROBIN gasps]
Unbelievable.

346
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,182
[ZORO]
Hey, Nami.

347
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:09,519
If you don't tell me what it
