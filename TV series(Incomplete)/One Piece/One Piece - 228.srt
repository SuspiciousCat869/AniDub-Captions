1
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,286
Ice Age.

2
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,662
[AOKIJI] I'm impressed that
you were able to survive,

3
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,264
especially as a child.

4
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,533
You managed to betray,
sidestep, and escape

5
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,301
from everyone in your past.

6
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:18,305
You survived in the underworld
by being quick to switch sides.

7
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,175
And now you've chosen
this crew as your next haven.

8
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,380
Every organization
that she's had something

9
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,382
to do with in the past
has been annihilated.

10
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,023
Pistol!

11
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,304
[AOKIJI] You have some
very loyal friends.

12
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,373
But you'll never change,
will you Nico Robin!

13
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,177
No! That's not true!

14
00:02:58,312 --> 00:02:59,346
Robin!

15
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,283
I'm not who I--

16
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,483
Robin!

17
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,121
Aaaah!!

18
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,152
[growls]

19
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,654
[LUFFY]
You bastard!

20
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:45,593
Stop yelling. If you thaw
her out carefully, she'll live.

21
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,596
However, her body is
extremely fragile in this state,

22
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,065
so you'll need to
handle her with care.

23
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,500
If any part of her
breaks, she'll die.

24
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:58,038
For example, if I were to
smash her apart, like this.

25
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,475
Robin!

26
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,310
No!

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,014
[LUFFY]
Stop!!

28
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,628
That was close!

29
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,336
[NAMI]
All right!

30
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,438
[CHOPPER]
That was amazing, Usopp!

31
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,607
What in the hell are you doing?

32
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,175
Usopp! Chopper! Quick!

33
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,278
Take Robin and
run back to the ship!

34
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,046
Thaw her out and keep her safe!

35
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,048
Right! You got it, Captain!

36
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,217
[USOPP]
Hurry! But be gentle, okay?!

37
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,284
[CHOPPER]
It's cold...

38
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,620
[USOPP] I know! But
Robin's even colder, genius!

39
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,792
[AOKIJI] Don't bother. The world
would be a much better place

40
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,693
without that woman in it.

41
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,332
[NAMI]
Not to split hairs.

42
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,333
But a pirate crew

43
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:02,469
pretty much consists of
people just like that.

44
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,371
You got that right, lady.

45
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,709
Now, if you don't mind.
Kindly step aside.

46
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,177
Nami!

47
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,911
[SANJI]
You're not gonna...

48
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,212
[ZORO]
...mess with this crew!

49
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,281
Wait! Nobody attack him!

50
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,522
[LUFFY]
Stay back, and don't interfere.

51
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,623
I'm gonna fight
him one-on-one.

52
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,663
[LUFFY]
What do you say?

53
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,700
The two of us can
settle this on our own.

54
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,235
Fine by me.

55
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,770
But since I don't have
a ship to take you back.

56
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,072
Then I'll just have to kill you.

57
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,410
[shower running]

58
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,546
[USOPP] She... She can't
breathe like this, can she?

59
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,781
[CHOPPER] I think she's in a
state of suspended animation.

60
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,284
[USOPP] Doesn't that mean she'll
die if we don't do something?!

61
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,720
[CHOPPER] If we warm her up
too quickly, she'll shatter.

62
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,755
We have to restore her body
temperature from the inside out.

63
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,160
Are you sure that this
is really gonna work?

64
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,630
I don't know.
But it's the only thing I--

65
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,231
Whoa, wait a minute,
you don't know?!

66
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,767
This is Robin's life
we're talking about here!

67
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,336
I know! But I've
never treated someone

68
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,538
whose entire body
was frozen before!

69
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,375
I know that Aokiji
said she was still alive.

70
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,810
But I just don't see how
that could be possible!

71
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,212
Don't give me that crap!

72
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,513
If you can't do
anything to save her,

73
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,148
then no one in
the whole world can!

74
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,316
You understand me?

75
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,685
You are the doctor of the
Straw Hat Pirates, got it?!

76
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,154
I know, okay! Just shut up
and stop yelling at me!

77
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,540
[ZORO]
Chopper!

78
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,146
[CHOPPER]
What's going on?

79
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,415
Why are just the three
of you here? Where's Luffy?

80
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,816
There's no time to explain!

81
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,052
We need to go back right away!

82
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,220
Help us do something about
this frozen arm and leg!

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,221
Oh! Right!

84
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,791
We... We need to douse
every part of your body

85
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,126
that's frozen in water!

86
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,362
But we're using the
shower room for Robin.

87
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,097
How is Robin? Is she okay?

88
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,799
Uh... It's too early to tell...

89
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,100
[loud splash]

90
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,301
What are you doing?

91
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,004
Will this do, Chopper?

92
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,543
Yes! Once the
ice begins to melt,

93
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,178
start rubbing
the affected areas

94
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,114
and then come up to
the ship right away!

95
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,583
Nami! Come aboard and
help us treat Robin!

96
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,650
[NAMI]
Right!

97
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,424
What the--?
Why are you guys here?

98
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,427
What happened? Where's Luffy?

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,663
Fighting Aokiji one-on-one.

100
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,897
One-on-one?!

101
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,100
You mean you left Luffy there
to face him all by himself?!

102
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,204
Those were the Captain's orders.

103
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,205
Are you crazy?!

104
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,407
Can't you tell when an
order is unreasonable?!

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,043
I can't believe you would be so
cold-hearted to just leave him--

106
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,078
Hey! It was a duel!

107
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,281
Can't you understand that?!
It's what he wanted!

108
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,116
Stop it, both of you!
This isn't the time!

109
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:09,189
Right now. We need
to stay focused, okay?

110
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,190
[ZORO] Whether this
decision was one of

111
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,693
his passing whims
or not, it doesn't matter.

112
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,760
Whatever happens,

113
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,630
we have to be ready to
deal with it, understand?

114
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,141
[AOKIJI] You really are
an odd one, aren't you?

115
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:33,780
[LUFFY]
Auuuughh!

116
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:58,038
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum... Storm!!

117
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,318
Now, it's Ice Time.

118
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,511
[LUFFY]
What do you say?

119
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,447
The two of us can
settle this on our own.

120
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,689
Aw, man. You tricked me.

121
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:51,525
The moment I agreed
to fight you one-on-one,

122
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,695
I settled on defeating
you and you alone.

123
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:56,630
But that was your
plan, wasn't it?

124
00:09:56,663 --> 00:10:01,035
If I were to attack your crew
now, I'd be the bad guy here.

125
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,438
Isn't that right, Captain?

126
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:09,109
Or maybe you actually
thought you could beat me.

127
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,684
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

128
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,787
Keep a close eye on Nico Robin.

129
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,057
Eventually, she'll grow to
be more than you can handle.

130
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,531
[AOKIJI] The nature of the
violent fate she was born into

131
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,834
will be a greater danger
than you can imagine.

132
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:38,371
More of a burden than you
could ever hope to bear.

133
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:46,513
That's what it means to have
that woman as part of your crew.

134
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,415
You have been warned...

135
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,118
...Mister Monkey D. Luffy!

136
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,360
[AOKIJI]
It would be easy to break you

137
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:04,798
and kill you right here and
now but I have a debt to honor.

138
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:14,208
[AOKIJI] Consider us even for
you taking care of Crocodile.

139
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:19,780
As well as... uh... uhh...
Oh, never mind...

140
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,283
Something to do
with Smoker, see ya!

141
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,824
[ZORO]
There he is!

142
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,793
[SANJI]
Luffy!

143
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,695
[ZORO]
He's still in one piece!

144
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,330
[SANJI]
That's good news!

145
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,599
[ZORO and SANJI] I'll carry him!
Let's get him to the ship!

146
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,700
Stop saying what I'm saying!

147
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,680
[AOKIJI] If they follow their
Log Pose from this island,

148
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,181
their next destination is--

149
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,588
It's Water Seven.
The City of Water, huh?

150
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,657
Oh my, my, my.
Would you look at that?

151
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,661
They're getting really close to
our headquarters, aren't they?

152
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:51,705
[CHOPPER]
Both of their hearts...

153
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,674
..are beating!

154
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,509
Yeah!

155
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,777
[USOPP]
Luffy!

156
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,178
[SANJI]
Robin!

157
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,112
No! You can't go in yet!

158
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,515
I don't want them
disturbed, understand?

159
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,284
Hey! Doctor Chopper!

160
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,619
How about I make
them some food?

161
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,721
Calling me Doctor
won't make me feel happy

162
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,090
or anything, you stupid jerk!

163
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,825
But I suppose some
warm drinks would be nice

164
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,294
for when they wake up.

165
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,396
I'll carry them in
to the lounge later.

166
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,298
Aye-aye, Sir!

167
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,300
Hey, Nami, should we set sail?

168
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,303
No, not yet. Not while the
Captain's out of commission.

169
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,571
The Log Pose has
our new heading,

170
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,340
but let's rest
here for the day.

171
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,274
Hmm?

172
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,047
[ZORO] What's wrong,
Usopp? You look beat.

173
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,416
Are there gonna be
more guys like him?

174
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,118
Coming after us
everywhere we go?

175
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,522
This is crazy.

176
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,792
I don't know how much
more of it I can take.

177
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,460
Get some sleep, idiot.

178
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,662
You're just exhausted, okay?

179
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,428
[NAMI] In order for
Luffy and Robin

180
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,130
to get some rest and recover,

181
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,598
the Going Merry
remained anchored off

182
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,201
the uninhabited
island for four days.

183
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,370
After that, we set sail.

184
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:32,706
Today marks the third morning
since we resumed our voyage.

185
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,508
The weather is clear and sunny.

186
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,777
Mostly spring, with
occasional bouts of summer.

187
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,785
It's beautiful!

188
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:48,388
[SANJI]
Nami! Looook!

189
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,826
I made this potato paille

190
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,062
especially for you,
mademoiselle.

191
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,329
I hope you enjoy it.

192
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,200
Delicious!

193
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,636
[SANJI]
That makes me so happy!

194
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,637
Hey! Keep it down, jerk!

195
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,806
Some people are trying
to sleep around here!

196
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,541
Sorry about that, cactus head.

197
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,243
My most sincere apologies.

198
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,111
What, you cigarette
snorkeling dartboard?!

199
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,681
[SANJI] Huh?
What did you call me?

200
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,517
[SANJI]
Dartboard. Dartboard eyebrows.

201
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,517
[SANJI]
What?!

202
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:19,153
[USOPP]
Lu...

203
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:19,620
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

204
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:20,154
[USOPP]
Lu...

205
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:20,621
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

206
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:21,155
[USOPP]
Lu...

207
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:21,622
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

208
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,156
[USOPP]
Lu...

209
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:22,623
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

210
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,358
[USOPP]
Lu...

211
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:24,825
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

212
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,359
[USOPP]
Lu...

213
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:25,826
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

214
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:26,360
[USOPP]
Lu...

215
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:26,827
[CHOPPER]
...ffy!

216
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,062
[USOPP]
Lu...

217
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,196
Hey!

218
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:30,230
[BOTH]
Whoo!

219
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,699
We've been waiting for this!

220
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:33,266
Luffy!

221
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,075
This is me, frozen!

222
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,282
[laughter]

223
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,152
Ugh, I can't believe
this is how he behaves

224
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,287
after almost freezing to death.

225
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,457
Whataya think?

226
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,324
[USOPP]
You nailed it!

227
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:59,827
That's exactly
what you looked like!

228
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,096
[NAMI] Make sure you
clean all that up, Luffy!

229
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,064
'Kay! Hey Nami, is that food?

230
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,232
What are you eating?

231
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,033
Some potato paille.

232
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,803
Potatoes, huh? I love potatoes!

233
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,338
Sanji! Make me some!

234
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,107
Just how many hours
a day to you have

235
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,708
to lie around and sleep, anyway?

236
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,842
That's none of your business!

237
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,245
I'll sleep as long as I like.
Wanna fight about it?

238
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,780
[NAMI]
Okay, you two. Enough.

239
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,816
Sanji, our Captain has requested
some of your potato paille.

240
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,318
[SANJI]
You got it, Nami!

241
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,453
[LUFFY]
Sanji! Potatoes!

242
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,488
[SANJI] You're still
recuperating,

243
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:28,489
but that hasn't slowed

244
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,790
your appetite down in
the slightest, has it?

245
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,366
So this is paille, huh?
Good stuff!

246
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,834
Why is it called that?

247
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,570
Because the meat is taken

248
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:45,272
from the tail of the
giant beast Paille.

249
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:47,174
I should know.
I was the one who killed it.

250
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,310
It was over 100 meters long!

251
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:52,446
Whoa! 100 meters?!
That's amazing, Usopp!

252
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,582
And I did it all
before breakfast.

253
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,284
[CHOPPER] Wait, you
woke up early to kill it?

254
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,321
Chopper, have you
forgotten who I am?

255
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:04,358
[CHOPPER] Oh! I get it!
You're Captain Us--

256
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,461
Yes! That's right! I am the
great and almighty Captain Uso--

257
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:08,095
[door opening]

258
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:08,728
Hm?

259
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,765
Hmm?

260
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,538
[NAMI]
Robin!

261
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,808
[SANJI]
Robin! Good to see you!

262
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:21,875
[CHOPPER]
Robin!

263
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,112
Are you feeling okay?
Do you still have a chill?

264
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,448
Your treatment helped
me out tremendously.

265
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,783
Thanks! You're a
wonderful doctor!

266
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,420
Calling me a wonderful doctor
won't make me happy

267
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,689
or anything, you stupid jerk.

268
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,523
[USOPP]
He sure looks happy.

269
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,223
[LUFFY]
Yep.

270
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,126
You should take it easy, Robin.

271
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,360
Luffy's already recovered enough

272
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:44,098
to where he's running around
and screaming like an imbecile.

273
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,233
But you can just relax
and take your time.

274
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:47,067
[LUFFY]
Yeah!

275
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,435
That wasn't a complement!

276
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,636
Hey, Robin!

277
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,306
Would you like me to make
you something to warm you up?

278
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,241
Do you have an appetite?

279
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,542
I do.

280
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,244
May I have some coffee, please?

281
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,646
[SANJI]
Of course! It's my pleasure!

282
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:16,297
Hmm?

283
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,731
What the heck is that?

284
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,541
Man, this paille
stuff is delicious!

285
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,510
I can't stop eating it!

286
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,178
Yeah, I know!

287
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,347
I bet we could make some
money selling this stuff.

288
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,715
Luffy, come quick!

289
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,451
There's a... There's a
frog doing the front crawl!

290
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,452
[LUFFY]
What?

291
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,654
See for yourself!
It's headed to your side!

292
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,721
Really?

293
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:43,591
I wonder if it's that
same frog we heard about.

294
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,425
Come on, Luffy.

295
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,326
Are you really
gonna take anything

296
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,195
that goofy Admiral
told you seriously?

297
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,497
There's no way a frog
would do the front crawl.

298
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,331
It's... HOLY CRAP!

299
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,500
THERE'S A FROG DOING
THE FRONT CRAWL!

300
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,169
[LUFFY]
Come on! After him!

301
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,170
[ZORO, USOPP, and CHOPPER]
Aye-aye!

302
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,239
[LUFFY] Take in the sail!
Stand by the oars!

303
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,140
Bring the ship
about to 2 o'clock!

304
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:00,774
[ZORO, USOPP, and CHOPPER]
Aye-aye!

305
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,775
[LUFFY]
Hurry!

306
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,842
[ZORO]
I don't know why,

307
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,779
but I get the feeling we
really have to follow it!

308
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,481
Sorry to keep you
waiting, mademoiselles.

309
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,086
Uhh... what's happening?

310
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,321
What the--? What's going on?

311
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,293
It seems like the ship
has changed its course.

312
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,828
Hey! What's the deal here?

313
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,430
Why'd you change our
course without asking me?

314
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:25,232
Nami! You're never
gonna believe it!

315
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,668
We found this huge frog
with scars all over its body

316
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,103
and we're following it!

317
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,671
A frog? What?

318
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:31,638
We have to catch up to it,

319
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,375
capture it, cook it,
and eat it for lunch!

320
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,109
You wanna eat it?!

321
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:39,413
[NAMI]
You're right!

322
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:39,980
Huh...

323
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,116
Is that a lighthouse?

324
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,319
Now what's a lighthouse
doing way out here?

325
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,254
I wonder if
anyone lives there.

326
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,423
[LUFFY] What's up?
Do you see an island?

327
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,425
Not really.
It's just a lighthouse.

328
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,061
There's not enough there
for the Log Pose to point to.

329
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,095
What about the frog?

330
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,830
Tell us which way the frog went!

331
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,964
Not a chance!

332
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,201
It looks like the frog is
headed to the lighthouse.

333
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,703
Frogs should be
marinated in white wine

334
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:03,804
to dissolve the mucus.

335
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,373
Then, you coat them with
flour and fry them up crisp.

336
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,775
Sanji! Snap out of it!

337
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,277
If the Captain says
we're going after the frog,

338
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,279
we really don't have
much choice in the matter.

339
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,214
Robin...

340
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,784
[LUFFY]
Let's go! Full speed ahead!

341
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:17,785
[ZORO, USOPP, and CHOPPER]
Aye-aye!

342
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,187
[NAMI] Why are you all
going along with this?!

343
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:29,229
[ZORO, USOPP, LUFFY and CHOPPER]
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

344
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,397
[LUFFY]
It's flying!!

345
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,232
Quick! Don't let it get away!

346
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,235
Let's get up ahead of it
