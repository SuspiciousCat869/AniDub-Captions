178
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,176
And I don't regret making
that decision one single bit.

There's no way

Then go ahead and run!

I accept whatever

the big boss, right?

'Cause I don't think
they get much bigger.

201

He let his pride and
anger get the best of him,

202
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,665
and now he's losing
control of himself.

He's got your shadows
trapped in there, too!

Which means he's
got your powers!

only got a few minutes!

you're not gonna help us out.

[ZORO] Our real

Moria suckin' in
all those shadows

to try and buy some time.

Alright. Second Gear.

There are only two ways
things can go at this point.

Either the sun wipes us out
or Moria destroys himself.

How can they get out?

I thought the shadows
were under his command?

236
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:06,944
Moria's losing consciousness

237
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,880
so he's losing control of
the shadows he stole, too!

238

that many shadows at once!

350
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:35,500
Come back, shadows!
Come back, shadows!

351
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,702
[LUFFY]
Y'know what?

352
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,605
I've got some words
for my shadow, too.

353
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,509
If you really wanna be

354
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,778
the shadow of the
king of the pirates,

355
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:58,323
then you better shape up,
and come back! Now!

356
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:18,343
then you better shape up,
and come back! Now!

357
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:38,363
then you better shape up,
and come back! Now!

358
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:51,677
then you better shape up,
and come back! Now!

359
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,747
[MORIA] Straw Hat,
you bastard! Just you watch.

360
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,152
[MORIA] You think you've
had it tough so far?

361
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,953
You don't even know tough!

362
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,121
But don't worry.

363
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,858
The real nightmare's waiting
for you in the New World!

364
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,633
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 374N]
The shadows are returning!

365
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,068
[RANDOM ROLLING PIRATE 374O]
At long last!

366
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,069
They're coming back!

367
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,072
They're actually coming back!

368
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,790
Hey! Quick, get down, you guys!

369
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,693
[FRANKY]
Whoa!

370
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,466
Shadow! Hurry back to me!

371
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,501
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
What's going on?

372
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,238
[NAMI]
This can't be happening.

373
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,208
No! Please, no!

374
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,477
[USOPP]
Wha--What the hell is going on?

375
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,978
This doesn't make any sense!

376
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,482
We beat Moria and got the
shadows out of him, so why?

377
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,052
[CHOPPER sobbing]

378
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,622
[CHOPPER]
Luffy!

379
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,932
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
My greatest fears have become

380
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,667
an unfortunate reality.

381
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,935
[KUMA]
So it would seem.

382
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:24,803
[MARINE COMMANDER 375A]
We can't afford

383
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,772
to let anyone know
of Moria's defeat.

384
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,141
You must obliterate
the Straw Hat crew

385
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,042
and everyone else
on Thriller Bark.

386
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,711
Leave no one alive.

387
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,246
Simple enough.

388
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,747
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

389
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,249
"Not Out of Danger Yet!

390
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,851
Orders to Annihilate
the Straw Hat Crew."

391
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
