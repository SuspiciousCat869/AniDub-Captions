By who?!

176
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,760
[GENZO]
The Marines.

177
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,262
[DOCTOR]
The Marines?!

178
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,030
[DOCTOR]
Nojiko?

179
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,800
[NOJIKO]
Uh... I'm alright...

180
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,135
Arlong has been working
with those damn Marines.

181
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,270
[DOCTOR]
What?

182
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,839
He's been lying to Nami
for the last eight years...

183
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,308
He never intended to
honor their agreement at all.

184
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,676
That bastard!

185
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,211
Oh no...! That means...

186
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,179
[VILLAGER C]
That scoundrel!

187
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,880
He lied to our Nami!

188
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,315
[VILLAGER D]
Poor Nami!

189
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,988
Nami.

190
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:26,459
Hey Nami...! What's up?!
Need help with anything?!

191
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,463
Why are you still here?

192
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,365
Stay outta my business...!

193
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,134
Just get away from our island!

194
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,175
[NAMI thinking]
Arlong...

195
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,977
Arlong.

196
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,812
Arlong!

197
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,748
And I'm the kind of
fish‐man who would rather die

198
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,150
than break an agreement
concerning money.

199
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,319
And I don't even care
how long it takes you,

200
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,755
I will honor our agreement.

201
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,257
[NAMI]
Arlong!

202
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,864
What's her problem?

203
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,382
[NAMI]
Arlong!

204
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,417
[GROUP]
Hmm?

205
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,518
[ARLONG]
Hmm?

206
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,719
Ah...

207
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,189
What seems to be the problem,
O skilled surveyor of ours?

208
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,291
Why the sour face?

209
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,394
Those Marine maggots you keep

210
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,564
on the payroll stole
every last berry I had!

211
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,599
What happened to all
that crap about dying

212
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,068
before you'd ever
break a promise

213
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,370
when it comes to money...?!
Bastard!

214
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,538
Refresh my memory.

215
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,772
Did I break a promise?

216
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,873
Don't play dumb with me!

217
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,376
I know that you teamed up
with the Marines to‐‐!

218
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,780
Just when did
I break that promise...?

219
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,615
Speak up girl.

220
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,619
Hahahaha!

221
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,657
[laughter]

222
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,427
[NAMI thinking]
Damn you... Damn you! Damn you!

223
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,165
Too bad... All your
stolen money got stolen...

224
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,601
That certainly is unfortunate...

225
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,436
But a deal is a deal Nami...

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,239
If you can't come up
with 100 million berries,

227
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,741
then both you
and your village stay

228
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,243
in my possession indefinitely.

229
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,579
Well, you know the terms. Hmm?

230
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,480
You pig!

231
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,282
Hahahaha!!

232
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,485
It's only 100 million berries!

233
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,854
Start saving again and
you'll have it in no time!

234
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,524
Hahahaha!!

235
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,627
Or, are you gonna run out on me?

236
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,963
Listen...

237
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,465
If you do that, I'll kill
everyone in that village.

238
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,434
Do you understand me?

239
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,671
[GENZO]
Nami...

240
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,608
We agreed we would never
tell you that we knew...

241
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,877
If you thought all of us
were counting on you,

242
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,478
you would be bound by guilt

243
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,648
never to leave his gang
for fear of letting us down.

244
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,389
Aww... Running away so soon?

245
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,793
Hahahaha!

246
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,628
Shouldn't we chase after her?

247
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,830
[ARLONG]
No need for that.

248
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,699
Trust me Hachi she's
not going anywhere...

249
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,868
There's no way Nami
could just abandon

250
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,538
the lives of all
those villagers.

251
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,841
[CHOO] Choo. Now that's
what I call playing dirty.

252
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:33,546
There's no way I'd let go of
an asset like Nami that easily.

253
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,917
I may be cruel but
I'm not totally heartless.

254
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,920
Once she's done charting
all the world's oceans,

255
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,255
she'll have her freedom.

256
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,658
[laughter]

257
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,994
That's pretty harsh man,
it'll take decades for sure.

258
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,865
Yeah, I bet a hundred
years wouldn't be enough!

259
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,703
All right!

260
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,706
Let's go meet up with
Luffy as soon as possible!

261
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,876
[USOPP]
Hey, Sanji... What're you doing?

262
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm appreciating happiness.

263
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,380
Wait, what are
you talking about?

264
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,683
Nami has had to live
with way more suffering

265
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,952
than any normal person...

266
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,790
Right now I'm making
a lot of good vibes

267
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,892
so I can send them her way...

268
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,927
Isn't everything great?

269
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,264
I bet that's not
all you're thinking about,

270
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,765
Love cook.

271
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,402
I'm trying to fight
for a beautiful person...

272
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,904
Is something wrong with that?

273
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,572
That's not right at all...!

274
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,709
This is supposed to be for
Nami and all the villagers!

275
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,410
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,252
[ZORO sighs]
Quit bickering!

277
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,420
Let's go.

278
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,960
We've had enough...!
Take up arms!

279
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,595
It's time to fight!

280
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,067
[NAMI thinking]
Genzo! Please!

281
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,937
Don't do anything stupid!

282
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,908
We have to live or our
struggles will mean nothing!

283
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,277
You can't throw your lives away!

284
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,746
[GENZO]
Eight long years ago...

285
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,949
We promised we wouldn't
live our lives in vain!

286
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,951
No matter the
pain or humiliation

287
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,855
we endured under Arlong, we
swore to fight the long fight

288
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,990
so Nami could
meet their demands!

289
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,592
But, they lied!

290
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,361
They never intended to
keep their end of the deal.

291
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,698
Instead they stole our
only chance at freedom!

292
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,599
So now...

293
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,868
We should make
those filthy fishmen pay

294
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,537
for the years they manipulated
that kind young girl...!

295
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,638
Am I right?!

296
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,006
[VILLAGER E]
Yeah! Let's do this!

297
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,308
[VILLAGER H]
We were always ready

298
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,009
to fight those monsters!

299
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,511
Let's get 'em!

300
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,513
Time to show those
lousy stinkin' fishmen

301
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,948
what we're made of!

302
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,616
Yeah!!

303
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,618
[NAMI]
Everybody! Wait!

304
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,453
Huh?

305
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,521
[NOJIKO]
Nami!

306
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,857
Hahaha.

307
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,992
Calm down...!

308
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,827
It's not that much money...!

309
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,662
I can make it
back in no time...!

310
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,332
I'll take care of it,
don't worry!

311
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,468
It'll be easy... this time!
I'm used to it!

312
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,005
I'll be fine! Just relax!
Everything is okay!

313
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,575
Hey... It's nothing
compared to back then.

314
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,013
It's okay...!
You don't need to save me!

315
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,581
C'mon everyone!

316
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,683
I'm perfectly fine!

317
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,858
You've done enough ...

318
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,495
You have to know
that there is no point now.

319
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,764
You struggled so hard,
carrying our lives

320
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,899
on your back this whole time.

321
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,901
I can only imagine
that joining them

322
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,169
must have been more painful,

323
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,372
than being stabbed
through the heart.

324
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,409
[GENZO]
You fought very well.

325
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,712
[NAMI]
Genzo...

326
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,054
Set yourself free
from this village.

327
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,556
[NAMI]
Genzo!

328
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,558
[NOJIKO]
Nami. Do it.

329
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,560
[NAMI]
What?! Nojiko!

330
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,395
Nami...

331
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,697
Go on.

332
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,465
You are an exceptional
young woman...

333
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,067
And you have a dream.

334
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,536
Everyone! Listen!

335
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,139
I won't let you go...!

336
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,407
Just stay right there...!

337
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,611
I'm not going to let any one
else get hurt by these monsters!

338
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,748
You'll all die...

339
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,750
We know that.

340
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,094
Nami... It's no use,
we've made up our minds!

341
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,666
Get outta the way!

342
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,170
[GENZO]
Move out!

343
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,939
[DOCTOR] We may not win
but we will give 'em hell!

344
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:59,945
[cheers]

345
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:13,459
[ARLONG laughs]

346
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,984
Arlong!

347
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,857
Arlong! Arlong!
Arlong! Arlong!

348
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,024
Arlong!

349
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,660
Arlong! Arlong!

350
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,496
Arl‐‐!

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,902
Luffy.

352
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,907
[NAMI]
What do you want?

353
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,976
You don't know
anything about this.

354
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,177
You don't know
what's been happening

355
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,579
on this island for
the past eight years.

356
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,215
[LUFFY]
Nope. I don't.

357
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,085
This has nothing to do with you!

358
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,687
I told you to leave this place.

359
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,256
Yep... You sure did.

360
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,692
[NAMI] So leave...!
I told you to leave...!

361
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,595
Get out of here...!
Get out of here now...!

362
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:28,700
Go...! Go away...!
Go...! Go...! Go!

363
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:45,184
[sobs]

364
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,725
[NAMI]
Luffy... Help me.

365
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,805
[LUFFY] Of course...
That's what friends do.

366
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,611
He's gonna pay!

367
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,049
You better keep
your hands off my hat.

368
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,619
[NAMI]
Luffy.

369
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,996
Let's go!

370
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,232
Right!

371
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,573
[VILLAGER A]
Hey! Are you guys all right?

372
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,576
[DOCTOR]
Did Arlong do this to you?

373
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,446
[GENZO]
Move aside!

374
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,515
We have business to take
care of with the fishmen.

375
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,318
When we finally found out
the truth about big sis Nami...

376
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,786
We realized the
only thing we could do

377
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,755
was defeat Arlong in battle...

378
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,691
So we decided to come back
here and challenge him.

379
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,361
Yeah... Then we lost,
but only by a hair.

380
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,632
I'm sorry but I can't
let you through this door...

381
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,700
You have no chance of victory.

382
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,534
What's that?

383
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,469
Be patient...

384
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,637
It won't be long now.

385
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,939
You see we're waiting for
the arrival of certain men.

386
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,475
What "certain men"?

387
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,476
[YOSAKU]
Don't worry.

388
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,846
They'll be here soon...
I'd bet my life on it!

389
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,562
There!

390
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,745
It's them...

391
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,416
But why would they come
to defend our village?

392
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,918
If those men can't
handle Arlong and his gang,

393
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,820
then there really is no hope...

394
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,257
Not only for this island
but for the whole East Blue.

395
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,359
[JOHNNY] Those are
the faces of the four men

396
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,728
who are here to
change your destiny...

397
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,230
Burn their images
into your memory!

398
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,574
[LUFFY]
Step aside.

399
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:29,548
[ARLONG laughs]

400
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,716
Hey.

401
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,517
Do you think those two idiots
that showed up earlier

402
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,553
are members of
Zoro's little crew?

403
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,356
Zoro? They seemed
too weak for that...

404
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,957
They weren't even worth killing.

405
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,958
That's for sure!

406
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,761
Hahahahahaha!!

407
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,363
Huh?

408
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,041
What the‐‐?!

409
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,879
Now which one of you is Arlong?

410
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,753
<i>♪All that's in my heart</i>
<i>confuses me</i>

411
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,755
<i>I cannot understand</i>

412
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,890
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

413
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,626
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

414
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,428
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

415
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,664
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

416
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,433
<i>As I drift away</i>

417
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:25,003
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

418
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,943
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

419
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,446
<i>I began to wonder</i>

420
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:39,351
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

421
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,620
<i>No answer has come</i>

422
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,690
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

423
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:50,629
<i>It's because of you</i>

424
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,798
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

425
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,467
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

426
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,968
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

427
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,439
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

428
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,541
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

429
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,043
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

430
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,546
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

431
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,382
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way♪</i>

432
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,992
[SANJI] You just had
to run ahead by yourself!

433
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,028
I said don't hog all the prey!

434
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,629
[LUFFY]
Really? Huh?

435
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,330
[ZORO]
What's wrong?!

436
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,164
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that's the thing!

437
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,033
I'm kind of in trouble!
Hear me out!

438
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,569
[USOPP] Oh, crap!
That guy plans to do something!

439
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,671
[LUFFY] What do I do?
What do I do?! What do I do?!

440
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,738
Ahhh!

441
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,873
[USOPP, ZORO, and SANJI]
Luffy!

442
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,641
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

443
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:40,178
"Luffy in Big Trouble!
Fishmen vs. the Luffy Pirates!"

444
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,547
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
