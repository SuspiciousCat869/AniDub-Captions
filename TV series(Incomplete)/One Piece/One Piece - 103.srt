Yes, that is correct.

176
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,442
Every assignment
performed as an agent,

177
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,410
every mission finished
since Baroque Works

178
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,912
was founded,
has been a part of this

179
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,614
single operation.

180
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,415
And those letters there

181
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,684
are the final orders
that you will receive.

182
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,420
The time has finally
come for Alabasta Kingdom

183
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,722
to disappear.

184
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,726
Once each of you has
completed the assignment

185
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,028
you have before you,
this desert kingdom

186
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,932
will destroy itself
from the inside out.

187
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,868
The rebel and royal armies
will have nowhere to go,

188
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,936
nowhere to turn.

189
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,472
As a result, they will fall
neatly into the hands

190
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,774
of Baroque Works.

191
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,609
If all goes according to plan,

192
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,478
in a single night,
Alabasta Kingdom

193
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,613
will become our utopia.

194
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,949
This mission is the final
and most important act

195
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,784
that Baroque Works
will carry out.

196
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,121
Failure is not an option.

197
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,491
We begin tomorrow at noon.

198
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,959
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

199
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,460
I wish you luck.

200
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,236
About this Operation Utopia.

201
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,306
May I ask you to
postpone it for a while?

202
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,026
How did you get here?

203
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,028
The location of
this room is a secret.

204
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,296
So what little hidey‐hole

205
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,765
did you crawl out of
to get here, Mr. 3?

206
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,201
Now I will finally
complete my mission.

207
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,503
Hold on. Mr. 2.

208
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,306
I didn't crawl out
from anywhere,

209
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,808
thank you very much.

210
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:11,177
I merely followed you all
from your little meeting

211
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,545
at Spiders Café.

212
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,046
It was easy enough to do.

213
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,348
I just hitched
a ride on the back

214
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,450
of Bunchi's car, unseen.

215
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,485
Boss. At last we meet.

216
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,821
I have come here to humbly
beg for your forgiveness,

217
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,690
and to ask that I may
be given a second chance.

218
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,359
You see, Mr. 2,

219
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,060
I knew that it was
only a matter of time

220
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,562
before someone was
sent to eliminate me

221
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,498
after I failed to complete
the assignment that I was given.

222
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,066
That is why I made the decision

223
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,369
to change my course
slightly and head directly

224
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,405
for our headquarters
at the Spiders Café.

225
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,308
You said you had failed
to complete a mission.

226
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,410
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,344
[MR. 3]
Well, you know.

228
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,580
How I was unfortunately
unable to prevent

229
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,315
the Straw Hat brats
and Princess Vivi

230
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,750
from escaping, remember?

231
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,817
[CROCODILE growls]

232
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,421
You're telling me
that they got away.

233
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,256
All of them?

234
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,493
You're saying that
they're still alive?

235
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,429
What were you talking about
on the transponder snail?

236
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,231
You said that they were dead.

237
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,867
Princess Vivi and her
bratty little pirate friends.

238
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,102
You did deal with
them, didn't you?!

239
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,504
[MR. 3]
A Transponder Snail?

240
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,105
I don't know what
you're talking about.

241
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,207
I never used a transponder
snail the entire time

242
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,677
I was on Little Garden,
not even once.

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,779
What?! [growls]

244
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,683
[SANJI] Yeah, hello, you've
reached the crap café.

245
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,084
Can I take your order?

246
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,424
This isn't good news.

247
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,459
Although it does explain
why the Unluckies

248
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,361
haven't returned
from Little Garden.

249
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,800
I assume you at least got
rid of one or two of them.

250
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,535
No, not exactly.

251
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,473
Wait! The information I was
given wasn't entirely accurate.

252
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,909
There were four pirate
escorts with Princess Vivi,

253
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,444
and then on top of
that there was this

254
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,379
really funny‐looking man
with a long nose.

255
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,914
Damn it!

256
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,316
Please, Boss. Can you
explain to the rest of us

257
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,552
what's going on
with all this insanity?

258
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,253
None of this makes any sense!

259
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,663
All of them!

260
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,665
I met all of these people!

261
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,168
Yes! I ran into them
on my way to the cafe.

262
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,670
Really?

263
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,238
There was this guy.

264
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,639
And this guy.

265
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,274
And this girl.

266
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,642
And this guy.

267
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,578
And this thing, too.

268
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,646
Plus, one more.

269
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,782
So Miss Wednesday
is really a princess

270
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,850
posing as an agent!

271
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,687
You mean these people
are all actually the enemy?!

272
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,190
That's correct. These people
have uncovered who I really am.

273
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,925
They need to be taken care of,

274
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,794
or they'll interfere
with the plan.

275
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,531
Mr. 3, you are
right about one thing.

276
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,866
It does seem like
they have added

277
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,868
one person and one animal.

278
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,536
Their group is
increasing in number

279
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,372
as they continue
to move forward.

280
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,374
Setting the pet aside,
I think there is something

281
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,543
that we can safely
assume at the moment.

282
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,512
Princess Vivi and her
four little friends

283
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,981
are very likely
in Alabasta already.

284
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,048
Now, to prepare.

285
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,352
Mr. 2, make photos of those
faces you displayed.

286
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,221
But... But, Boss, I promise
that I will eliminate Vivi

287
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,657
and her friends with
my own two hands.

288
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,793
[CROCODILE]
Just shut up, you damn fool!

289
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,395
Now, Mr. 3.

290
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,799
Listen very carefully.

291
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,401
Do you have any idea
why I gave you your rank‐‐

292
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,637
why you're an
officer agent? Hmm?

293
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:29,742
In terms of fighting skills
alone, even Mr. 4 has you beat.

294
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,410
Do you understand that?

295
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,647
I promoted you because
of your underhanded

296
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,716
tenacity when it comes to
completing an assignment.

297
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,887
You have gravely
disappointed me.

298
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,722
What's happening to him?!

299
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,424
He's just shriveling up!

300
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,763
Water... I need water...

301
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,598
Some water...

302
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,402
You can have all the water
you want, down there.

303
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,604
[MR. 3 screams]

304
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,345
[knocking]

305
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,784
It looks to be feeding time.

306
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,954
Where am I now?

307
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,388
Underwater?

308
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,294
It looks almost
like a giant aquarium.

309
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,431
A bananagator!

310
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,435
[MR. 3 screams]

311
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,406
Nothing but trouble.

312
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,644
But no longer!

313
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,613
[slam]

314
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,749
[CROCODILE]
Now the rest of you, listen up!

315
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,751
Take a good look at these five.

316
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,553
They are determined
to stop the rebellion

317
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,654
in Alabasta.

318
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,624
If we leave them alone,
they are bound to come to us.

319
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,892
I understand that.

320
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,828
But Boss, even if the girl is
the princess of this country,

321
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,429
do you really think
that she can prevent

322
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,665
the rebellion at this point?

323
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,600
[CROCODILE] Unfortunately,
she has a connection

324
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,102
that she can take advantage of.

325
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,071
Princess Vivi Nefertari
and the rebel leader, Koza,

326
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,974
were apparently friends
when they were children.

327
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,343
The rebels have seven
hundred thousand.

328
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,679
Even if the rebellion
can't be stopped now,

329
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,948
Princess Vivi is certainly
capable of bringing

330
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,851
real confusion to their ranks.

331
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,686
I've already sent
many of the Billions

332
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,489
to join with Koza's
rebel forces.

333
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,124
The fact that I
haven't heard anything

334
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,825
from our men must mean that Vivi

335
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,994
and her friends have
not yet taken any action.

336
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,929
This is good.

337
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,797
Whatever the cost,
they must be prevented

338
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,866
from making contact
with the rebel army

339
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,869
before the operation is
complete and we have won.

340
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,972
[CROCODILE]
Miss All Sunday?

341
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,940
Sir?

342
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,708
[CROCODILE]
Given the current circumstances,

343
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,843
we should use
transponder snails.

344
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,713
Contact the Billions
who're in Nanohana.

345
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,717
Tell them to kill on sight
without any hesitation.

346
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,688
Do not allow Princess Vivi
and the pirates into Katorea!

347
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:00,025
Vivi must not be allowed to
meet with the rebel leader Koza!

348
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,126
Yes, sir.

349
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,397
[CROCODILE] Now, the rest
of you get going as well.

350
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,533
You don't want to
miss the fun, do you?

351
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,570
We are very close to
realizing our utopia.

352
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,982
I'd hate to be
disappointed by any of you.

353
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,550
You understand?

354
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,585
Just leave it to us, Boss, sir.

355

356

Go enjoy yourselves.

357
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,734
[TOTO] I'm so sorry I didn't
have more to offer you,

358
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:42,601
Princess Vivi.

359
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,837
[VIVI]
No, please don't worry about it.

360
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,772
Well, we should
be off now, Toto.

361
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,008
[TOTO] Oh. Luffy.
Here, take this with you.

362
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,010
Wow! Water!

363
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:51,944
Water!

364
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,045
You found some, then?

365
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,881
Yes, it was last night,
a bit after you fell asleep

366
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,883
while digging that
huge hole of yours.

367
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,086
I finally reached a moist
layer under the dry stuff.

368
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,388
That water there is the moisture

369
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,923
that I was able to extract
from the damp sand.

370
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,958
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

371
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,093
That sounds pretty
complicated, but thank you.

372
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,729
That right there
is genuine Yuba water.

373
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,699
It's not much, but it's
all I was able to get.

374
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,101
Right.
Then I'll drink it with care.

375
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,379
[USOPP] Hey, Luffy, what
are you doing over there?

376
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,718
Luffy?

377
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,219
Um, is everything all right?

378
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,426
I quit.

379
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,728
[GROUP]
Huh?

380
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,431
What do you mean?

381
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,067
What's that mean?
Quit what, Luffy?

382
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,234
Oh, come on.

383
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,736
We don't have time
to put up with

384
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,238
every weird little mood
you have right now, Luffy.

385
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,807
Let's go.

386
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,341
Yeah, shouldn't we get going?

387
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,910
Yes, we should, and fast.

388
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,912
If we don't get back
to that Katorea place

389
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,447
the way we came
and stop the rebellion

390
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,083
that's about to begin, then
a million Alabasta citizens

391
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,118
are gonna start fighting
and things will get real ugly

392
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,419
real quick.

393
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,289
We're doing this for Vivi!
So let's go.

394
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,461
What is wrong with you?!

395
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,097
Vivi.

396
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,798
Yes?

397
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,267
Right now all I wanna do
is kick Crocodile's ass,

398
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,336
you understand?

399
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,206
Maybe we can keep the people
from starting a rebellion,

400
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,041
but that won't stop Crocodile.

401
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,943
Besides, we won't be
able to accomplish

402
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,478
anything in Katorea.

403
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,814
We're pirates.
Everyone knows things

404
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,783
are better off
without us around.

405
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,486
You gotta admit,
he has a way of getting

406
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,988
straight to the point
when he really wants to.

407
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,225
Well, yeah, but not often.

408
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,860
No, that's not true.

409
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,028
[LUFFY] You want it to work
out so that nobody dies

410
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,898
in this fight,
isn't that right, Vivi?

411
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,501
None of the citizens.

412
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,002
None of us, either.

413
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,373
We're up against one
of the Seven Warlords

414
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,408
of the Sea and a million
of your own people

415
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,977
on top of that.

416
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,311
And you still want
everyone to end up

417
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,913
all safe and sound.

418
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,850
You'll never win that way.

419
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,823
Come on, Luffy.
Can't you at least try showing

420
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,158
Vivi a little sympathy?

421
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,392
Wait. Hold on, Nami.

422
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,493
For what?

423
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,830
And what's wrong with that, huh?

424
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,198
What is so wrong
about not wanting

425
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,334
to see people die or get hurt?

426
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,270
'Cause people die, that's why.

427
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,277
Stop talking like that!
I won't listen to it!

428
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,846
Say that again and
I will really hurt you!

429
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,349
That's the whole point
of what we're doing here.

430
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,951
Don't you understand?

431
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,086
No one here in Alabasta,
not the rebel army,

432
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,455
the royal army, or the people,
is to blame for this!

433
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,291
None of them have
done anything wrong!

434
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,859
Why should any
of them have to pay

435
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,893
for what's happened?

436
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,930
When every last bit
of it is Crocodile's fault?

437
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,436
[LUFFY]
So you're saying it's only

438
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,573
all right for you to die!

439
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,308
Whoa, Luffy!
You've gone too far!

440
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,475
Damn it, Luffy!

needs more than anything!

You think that putting
just your life on the line

449

is enough to stop
this from happening?!

450
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,473
Well, what else exactly
should I be putting

451
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,575
on the line with
it then, Luffy?!

get away with this!

I don't have anything else
I can put on the line.
