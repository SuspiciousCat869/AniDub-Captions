00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.620
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.757
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.693
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.979
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.882
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:47.121
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:49.290
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.323 --> 00:02:50.658
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.927
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.829
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.231
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.264 --> 00:02:59.934
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.605
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:06.173
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:09.877
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.014
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.017 --> 00:03:18.519
[NARRATOR] The first
stop on Luffy's journey

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:21.489
is Fishman Island, thousands
of feet below sea level,

00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:24.892
where his crew becomes
involved in a civil war.

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:27.328
Jimbei tells them the
tragic history of the island

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:29.530
and reveals his
connection to Arlong.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:31.765
Despite his role
in Nami's suffering,

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.168
she forgives him wholeheartedly.

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:37.972
Soon after, the Straw Hats
receive a surprise transmission.

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:42.676
[HORDY] Hello there,
people of Fishman Island.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.212
Am I coming through?

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:47.848
Well then, for those
of you who don't know,

00:03:47.882 --> 00:03:51.452
I'm the captain of
the New Fishman Pirates.

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:54.922
My name is Hordy Jones!

[LUFFY]
"The Kingdom in Shock!

00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:04.365

[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Come on, next!

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.271
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Next!

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.041
[FISHMAN A crying]

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:15.543
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A]
Next!

00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.383
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B]
You won't step on it?

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:23.684
[FISHMAN C groans]

00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.720
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B laughs]

00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:29.189
[FISHMAN D] I'm sure Queen
Otohime would forgive us.

00:04:29.223 --> 00:04:31.425
[FISHMAN B]
If I refuse, they'll kill me.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.327
I can't believe
this is happening!

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.263
I'm sorry Queen Otohime!
I don't want to!

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:39.066
There ya go. Next!

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.735
[MERMAID A crying]

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:42.803
[cackles]

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:45.973
How boring. No one's
even trying to resist!

00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:50.477
[DARUMA] People are stomping on
her without a second thought!

00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.013
Hey, Daruma! You gotta
come see this, quick!

00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:55.149
Captain Hordy's live on the air!

00:04:55.182 --> 00:04:57.117
[DARUMA]
Huh?

00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.186
[CROWD murmuring]

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.188
So he's the one behind all this.

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:02.256
The bastard.

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.825
Why does he want us to
step on the queen so bad?

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:06.360
Wait, that guy?

00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:08.762
Wasn't he also the
soldier from the plaza?

00:05:08.796 --> 00:05:11.565
He killed Otohime's
assassin that day!

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.034
That's right!
His name is Hordy Jones!

00:05:14.068 --> 00:05:15.169
The same guy!

00:05:15.202 --> 00:05:17.871
Why would one of Neptune's
soldiers do such a thing?

00:05:17.905 --> 00:05:19.607
[HORDY]
There's something every citizen

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.110
of the Ryugu Kingdom
needs to know.

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:26.413
This will be destroyed
and quickly.

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:30.217
We'll rebuild it from scratch,
but with a new king...

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:32.319
...like me!

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.587
[grunts]

00:05:43.497 --> 00:05:45.199
[FISHMAN AA]
What's he talkin' about?

00:05:45.232 --> 00:05:47.434
[FISHMAN BB] Who does he
think he is? Screw you!

00:05:47.468 --> 00:05:48.469
This is crazy!

00:05:48.502 --> 00:05:50.504
Where is this broadcast
even comin' from?

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:52.640
King Neptune. Is he okay?

00:05:52.673 --> 00:05:55.309
[FISHMAN CC] The Straw Hats
supposedly took over the palace.

00:05:55.342 --> 00:05:57.344
Do you think they're his allies?

00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:59.413
[FISHMAN DD]
Nothing makes sense anymore!

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:02.583
[HORDY] I will usher in
a new era for Fishman Island,

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:05.986
grounded in a strict
code of discipline.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.757
For starters, we'll end all
friendly relations with humans.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.159
So if you like 'em, get out!

00:06:12.192 --> 00:06:15.262
Yes. Fishmen are far
superior to humans.

00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.798
It's time that race of
weaklings learned its place.

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:19.767
They don't deserve our help!

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.103
In place of the sympathizers,
those loyal to our cause

00:06:23.137 --> 00:06:26.006
will move in from
the Fishman District.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.608
They hate humans, too,

00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:30.978
and will do whatever it takes
to rid this country of them.

00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.547
So treat them with respect!

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.883
[FISHMAN EE]
Is he serious? New residents?

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.451
[FISHMAN FF] He's just
gonna let all these criminals

00:06:37.484 --> 00:06:39.319
roam free through our kingdom?

00:06:40.487 --> 00:06:42.122
[FUKABOSHI, MANBOSHI,
RYUBOSHI growl]

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:44.425
Ya still love her, don't you?

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:48.162
Otohime, our most
cherished queen.

00:06:48.195 --> 00:06:50.931
She was indeed selfless
and worked tirelessly

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:53.467
to build a bridge between
Fishmen and humans.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.769
I do respect her spirit.

00:06:55.803 --> 00:06:58.439
But have you forgotten
the end of her tale?

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:00.307
She was killed by a human!

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.509
Even if you approach
them with a pure heart

00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:05.012
and kind intentions, they'll
just take advantage of you

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:07.381
and leave you in the dirt!

00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:09.683
We have to wake up!
Can't you see?

00:07:09.717 --> 00:07:10.584
[RYUBOSHI growls]

00:07:10.617 --> 00:07:12.519
[MANBOSHI growls]

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:13.821
Hordy!

00:07:13.854 --> 00:07:15.656
[HORDY]
Sorry, but the royal family's

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.524
been duping you for years.

00:07:17.558 --> 00:07:20.928
If we follow them,
we'll face extinction.

00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:22.496
As long as humans exist

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:25.065
this goal of harmony
is unattainable.

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:28.836
It's a pipe dream that's been
perpetuated for far too long.

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:29.837
Stop it.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.538
See for yourself!

00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.743
They have Father!

00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:36.877
How could they?

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.345
Father!

00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:40.447
[CROWD]
Not the King!

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.649
[HORDY]
King Neptune got old.

00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:45.185
It happens to everyone.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.088
The only way to advance
is to eliminate the old guard

00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:50.424
so they won't hold
us back any more.

00:07:50.457 --> 00:07:52.693
[NEPTUNE growls]

00:07:52.726 --> 00:07:56.029
Huh. When you think about it,
this mess is kind of our fault.

00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:58.398
If we hadn't shown up,
the King might be fine.

00:07:58.432 --> 00:07:59.566
[JIMBEI]
Hmm?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.301
[NAMI]
More like Zoro's fault.

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.637
And that's why you
shouldn't feel guilty.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.174
Moss Head just can't keep his
swords to himself, that's all.

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:09.376

you do at the palace?

A bunch of Neptune's soldiers

00:08:12.713 --> 00:08:14.448
attacked Namichin
and her friends first!

00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:16.483
They were just trying
to defend themselves!

the weak and incompetent
King Neptune...

00:08:35.936 --> 00:08:37.604
...will be put to death!

00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:39.273
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:41.842
[HORDY] The Great Pirate
Era began when the Navy

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:46.914
executed a human, Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates.

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:49.316
That era was notable
for countless acts

00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:52.119
of persecution at
the hands of humans.

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:56.657
It's only natural then
that Neptune's execution

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.560
will bring about
a Great Fishman Era--

00:08:59.593 --> 00:09:02.763
one in which we
reign over humans.

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:07.935
As you may have
figured out by now,

I am at the Ryugu Palace.

else I want to show you.

...with signatures from

[HORDY] Frankly,
I'm disgusted by the numbers.

want to befriend humans
after all they've done?

you don't mind doing it
just to save yourselves.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.017
[NEPTUNE]
Stop this at once!

00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:05.052
[HORDY grunts]

00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:07.120
[NEPTUNE] I won't let you
terrorize my people

00:11:07.154 --> 00:11:09.623
while I'm still around!

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:13.694
Well, that's just a little
preview of things to come.

00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:17.864
Also... before I go...

00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.566
[HORDY chuckles]

00:11:21.101 --> 00:11:25.238
...Straw Hat,
I know you're there.

00:11:25.272 --> 00:11:28.675
I have something that
may be of interest to you.

00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.012
[HORDY] As you watch
from wherever you are,

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:34.481
I want you to know that
this is just the beginning

00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:39.052
of my revenge for what
you did to Arlong. Enjoy.

00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:42.022
Aw, man! He even captured Zoro?!

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:43.924
That's what we get
leaving them alone.

00:11:43.957 --> 00:11:46.393
But still, all three?

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:48.895
Do it.

00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:50.764
Right!

00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.165
Do it.

00:11:58.472 --> 00:12:00.874
Oh, no, what's this?
We're going up?

00:12:00.907 --> 00:12:02.476
This can't possibly be good.

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:04.911
[shrieking]

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.816
[BROOK]
Hello? Yes? Now what?

00:12:10.784 --> 00:12:12.419
[chuckles]

00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:17.691
Something's coming.

00:12:17.724 --> 00:12:19.092
Ah, no.

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:23.897
[BROOK, USOPP]
It's water!

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.098
[BROOK, USOPP screaming]

00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:27.868
[HORDY] By the time we
finish the King's execution,

00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:31.605
that room will be
completely flooded.

00:12:31.638 --> 00:12:35.542
You lowly humans can't survive
that, if I'm not mistaken.

00:12:35.575 --> 00:12:37.277
Too bad.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.080
Straw Hat Luffy!
Look at that bounty!

00:12:40.113 --> 00:12:41.982
Four hundred million!

00:12:42.015 --> 00:12:44.284
The heads of you and your
crewmates will serve as

00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:47.521
a perfect warning to any
humans who dare defy us!

00:12:47.554 --> 00:12:52.359
But for now, we're tearing
down the old Ryugu Kingdom!

00:12:52.392 --> 00:12:56.763
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES cheering]

00:12:56.797 --> 00:12:59.399
We're done with the
failures of the past.

00:12:59.433 --> 00:13:02.436
This is the time for revolution!

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:04.704
Just three hours,
that's all that we need.

00:13:04.738 --> 00:13:08.408
Fishman Island will take back
its pride in three hours!

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:10.644
[cackles]

00:13:18.552 --> 00:13:20.053
We can't stay.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:40.674
We shall... stop them!

00:14:02.462 --> 00:14:04.264
Now then,

00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:07.667
issue an order to Daruma
and the others to assemble.

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:09.136
We need to act quickly.

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:11.071
Sure thing, Captain.

00:14:11.104 --> 00:14:13.607
[HORDY] Your execution's
going to be big.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.409
The more citizens
that fear me, the better.

00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:18.178
I don't have time
to convince everyone

00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:19.880
that my way is the right one.

00:14:19.913 --> 00:14:22.282
[NEPTUNE] You're only
thinking of yourself!

00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:27.187
Even if you were right,
a nation can't prosper in fear!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.090
The truth is,
all rulers are selfish.

00:14:30.123 --> 00:14:31.525
I'm surprised.

00:14:31.558 --> 00:14:35.028
You should know that better
than anyone, "Your Majesty."

00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:36.763
Ever since I was a soldier,

00:14:36.796 --> 00:14:40.967
I've been dragged along by
Queen Otohime's foolish dream.

00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:42.269
We all have.

00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:46.940
Thankfully, you'll be gone soon,
and then they'll see the truth.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:51.378
They'll have to because
my law will reign supreme!

00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:57.284
Hey, guys! This water
isn't getting any lower!

00:14:57.317 --> 00:15:00.353
Oh, no. I just got dry, too.

00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:03.356
Now let's all figure
out a way to save me.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.425
Or better yet, save us!

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:07.761
Do ya have any ideas? Anything?

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:10.197
I'm thinking. First...

00:15:11.198 --> 00:15:13.133
...get me out of these chains.

00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:14.334
You got it!

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:17.037
Psychic powers,
don't fail me now!

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.773
Chains, come off!
Chains, come off!

00:15:19.806 --> 00:15:23.243
Your links are getting looser,
the metal's getting weaker.

00:15:23.276 --> 00:15:25.312
Chains, begone!

00:15:25.345 --> 00:15:27.681
[sighs] Nothing.

00:15:27.714 --> 00:15:30.150
Well, we're stuck.
Nice knowing you guys.

00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:32.252
[BROOK]
I still can't stop laughing.

00:15:32.285 --> 00:15:35.388
D-Did you see the look on those
Fishmen's faces when I stood up?

00:15:35.422 --> 00:15:37.023
Priceless!

00:15:41.528 --> 00:15:45.765
[USOPP groaning]

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.934
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F]
He's not movin'. Is he dead?

00:15:47.968 --> 00:15:51.071
[USOPP] Just keep still
and they won't know.

00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:54.541
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G]
What about this old skeleton

00:15:54.574 --> 00:15:55.842
hanging off the ledge?

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:57.210
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H]
How did something like that

00:15:57.244 --> 00:15:58.345
even get here?

00:15:58.378 --> 00:16:00.413
Who knows? Sure is weird.

00:16:00.447 --> 00:16:02.015
Maybe it got swept
up in the current

00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:03.984
when Captain Hordy
busted through the wall.

00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:06.052
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G]
Let's pull it up on the bridge.

00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:07.754
[ZORO]
Perfect!

00:16:07.787 --> 00:16:08.888
[USOPP]
Brook can free us later

00:16:08.922 --> 00:16:10.690
if he keeps
pretending to be dead!

00:16:10.724 --> 00:16:13.693
Who knew being a skeleton
would come in so handy?

00:16:13.727 --> 00:16:16.329
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE H] Poor guy
was probably adrift at sea.

00:16:16.363 --> 00:16:17.964
I can't help but
feel sorry for him.

00:16:17.998 --> 00:16:20.467
It looks like he
died a long time ago.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.168
--Right you are!
--[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES gasp]

00:16:22.202 --> 00:16:24.404
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES
gasp, scream]

00:16:24.437 --> 00:16:26.172
I did die!

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:28.008
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
He's alive!

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:31.711
Somewhat! Well, I make do
at least. The name's Brook.

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:35.315
[laughs]

00:16:35.348 --> 00:16:37.183
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:16:37.217 --> 00:16:40.754
[BROOK yelling, laughing]

00:16:40.787 --> 00:16:42.555
[ZORO]
Nice one, Brook!

00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:45.859
[BROOK shrieks]

00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:48.795
[USOPP groaning]

00:16:48.828 --> 00:16:51.765
[BROOK] You wanna touch
my afro? It's fluffy!

00:16:51.798 --> 00:16:53.800
Why don't you rub it
and make a wish?

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:55.669
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Enough!

00:16:57.203 --> 00:16:59.072
[BROOK groans]

00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:05.478
[ZORO]
So much for that.

00:17:05.512 --> 00:17:09.916
[BROOK laughing]

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:12.786
If I laugh any harder, I'll die!

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.354
[USOPP, ZORO]
We're all gonna die!

00:17:14.387 --> 00:17:16.623
We wouldn't have gotten
caught if it weren't for you!

00:17:16.656 --> 00:17:18.992
Please help! They're killing me!

00:17:19.025 --> 00:17:22.095
Wait. Never mind.
You're killing me, too.

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:23.730
[laughs]

00:17:23.763 --> 00:17:26.833
Well, at least Nami
and the others escaped.

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.768
Soon, Luffy and
the rest of the crew

00:17:28.802 --> 00:17:30.003
will come get us outta here.

00:17:30.036 --> 00:17:32.572
Wishful thinking!
What if they don't?

00:17:32.605 --> 00:17:34.541
As Robin would say,

00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:36.910
"Oh. I hope Nami
hasn't been eaten

00:17:36.943 --> 00:17:38.511
by some deep-sea creature."

00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:43.083
[BROOK laughs]
Just like her!

00:17:55.862 --> 00:17:58.264
This Poneglyph is
different from the others.

00:17:58.298 --> 00:18:01.034
Now, let's see.

00:18:01.067 --> 00:18:06.239
It looks like a letter...
as well as an apology.

00:18:06.272 --> 00:18:08.675
But who is this apology for?

00:18:08.708 --> 00:18:10.944
And why did you
engrave it stone?

00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:13.613
"Joy Boy."

00:18:37.437 --> 00:18:39.672
Hey.

00:18:39.706 --> 00:18:42.475
That's a lot of money!
Four hundred million?

00:18:42.509 --> 00:18:44.677
When did it go up, huh?

00:18:44.711 --> 00:18:46.980
No one cares about your bounty!

00:18:48.415 --> 00:18:50.884
Obviously, they're using
the others as bait.

00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:53.386
Think about it, Luffy.
You're infamous now.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.489
The conflict at Marineford
made sure of that.

00:18:56.523 --> 00:19:00.693
Once you surpass 300 million,
it rarely increases again.

00:19:04.864 --> 00:19:08.001
Well, anyway, if someone wants
to fight me, I'll fight 'em!

00:19:08.034 --> 00:19:10.603
[JIMBEI]
I beg you. Don't act rashly!

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:14.007
They have Father.

00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:20.113
My father needs me.

00:19:20.146 --> 00:19:23.082
I have to help!
I'm coming, Daddy!

00:19:24.384 --> 00:19:26.119
Megalo!

00:19:26.152 --> 00:19:27.654
Shaa!

00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:31.191
I can't just stay here!

00:19:31.224 --> 00:19:33.359
Come back! Shirahoshi!

00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:35.028
[MEGALO]
Shaa!

00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:37.564
Megalo! Don't move!

00:19:37.597 --> 00:19:39.833
You could die!

00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:41.968
If I don't save Father...

00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.269
...then he...

00:19:43.303 --> 00:19:47.373
I do understand the urgency,
but please, you must listen.

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:52.412
Nyu. He's right.
You can't go back right now.

00:19:52.445 --> 00:19:54.247
You, too?

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.615
[HACHI]
The one person that Hordy

00:19:55.648 --> 00:19:59.385
is most afraid of
in the Ryugu Kingdom...

00:19:59.419 --> 00:20:02.489
...is you, Princess. Your power!

00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:06.125
[HACHI] Even if Hordy
does change the island

00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:09.095
to suit his needs,
you'll still be a threat.

00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:10.830
If you summon the Sea Kings,

00:20:10.864 --> 00:20:14.300
everything will come
crashing down in an instant.

00:20:14.334 --> 00:20:16.870
That's why he took
King Neptune hostage--

00:20:16.903 --> 00:20:19.506
to neutralize the princess
and to lure her back!

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.908
You're saying this whole time

00:20:21.941 --> 00:20:23.977
they've really been
after Shirahoshi.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.547
[HACHI] Nyu. Yes, but not
in the way you might think.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.050
Hordy doesn't want to capture
the princess to use her power.

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:32.218
This may sound cruel,

00:20:32.252 --> 00:20:35.755
but he'd prefer a threat
like her not exist at all.

00:20:35.788 --> 00:20:38.124
That's why he partnered
with Vander Decken.

00:20:38.157 --> 00:20:40.159
Decken is capable
of killing her.

00:20:40.193 --> 00:20:41.427
Plain and simple:

00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:44.197
he'll destroy anything
that stands in his way.

00:20:45.265 --> 00:20:46.332
That's right.

00:20:46.366 --> 00:20:49.269
Hordy wants the princess
to rush into the plaza.

00:20:49.302 --> 00:20:51.871
There, she would
be most vulnerable.

00:20:51.905 --> 00:20:54.774
[SHIRAHOSHI] Um, my family
has mentioned my power before,

00:20:54.807 --> 00:20:56.242
but I'm afraid that's all.

00:20:56.276 --> 00:20:58.978
Even if you were to ask me to
communicate with the Sea Kings,

00:20:59.012 --> 00:21:01.214
I don't think I
could do it. Not now.

00:21:01.247 --> 00:21:02.482
To be honest,

00:21:02.515 --> 00:21:05.718
I'm not convinced that I have
the power in the first place.

00:21:05.752 --> 00:21:07.186
[JIMBEI]
Whether you do or not,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.523
Hordy has no qualms with
killing you just to be safe.

00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:14.027
Therefore, we must
not let him find out

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.362
that you aren't able
to control the power.

00:21:16.396 --> 00:21:19.265
The more afraid of you he is,
the better things are for us.

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:23.870
All right. Are you done?
Good. Then I'm going.

00:21:23.903 --> 00:21:26.306
Hey, shark! Take me
back to the palace!

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:27.273
Shaa!

00:21:27.307 --> 00:21:29.542
I'm leaving the crybaby
with you. That cool?

00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:30.376
[SANJI]
Woo!

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.344
Hell, yeah.

00:21:31.377 --> 00:21:33.813
[JIMBEI]
Luffy! I told you to wait!

00:21:33.846 --> 00:21:34.647
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:21:34.681 --> 00:21:35.682
[JIMBEI]
You don't get it.

00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:37.984
You people have no
business fighting Hordy!

00:21:38.017 --> 00:21:40.019
What's the big deal, huh?

00:21:40.053 --> 00:21:42.255
[BOTH] We can't fight 'cause
we're humans! Is that it?

00:21:42.288 --> 00:21:44.123
It doesn't make sense
when you two say it!

00:21:44.157 --> 00:21:45.592
Quit complicating things!

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:48.595
[JIMBEI] That's right!
This battle isn't for you!

00:21:48.628 --> 00:21:50.196
If you win,
the surviving Fishmen

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:52.398
will go on hating humans again!

00:21:56.436 --> 00:21:59.305
[JIMBEI]
Please. Allow me to handle it.

00:21:59.339 --> 00:22:02.609
I can't! Not when
my crew is in trouble!

00:22:02.642 --> 00:22:04.277
It's not that I don't trust you,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.313
but this fight is
personal for me, too.

00:22:07.347 --> 00:22:08.915
You guys.

00:22:08.948 --> 00:22:10.650
They're both right.

00:22:10.683 --> 00:22:12.819
[JIMBEI grumbles]

00:22:13.853 --> 00:22:16.089
Stay out of this. Wait here.

00:22:16.122 --> 00:22:17.423
Not a chance.

00:22:17.457 --> 00:22:18.958
Such a stubborn fool!

00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:20.927
Just shut up already!

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.764
I said I'm going.
Stop me if you can!

00:22:24.797 --> 00:22:26.099
Luffy.

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:33.006
[JIMBEI]
Since we were allies before,

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.875
I had hoped that you
would honor my request.

00:22:35.908 --> 00:22:38.611
How easily I forget who you are.

00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:42.448
Hard-headedness truly
does run in your family.

00:22:42.482 --> 00:22:46.352
If you're not going to listen
to me... I have no choice!

00:22:46.386 --> 00:22:48.454
[gasps]

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:04.003
Stand down, Luffy...

00:23:06.372 --> 00:23:07.440
...or else.

00:23:13.746 --> 00:23:15.548
[NARRATOR] Fearing that
the Straw Hat's interference

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:17.183
may do more harm than good,

00:23:17.216 --> 00:23:20.453
a battle of wills breaks out
between Luffy and Jimbei.

00:23:20.486 --> 00:23:22.422
While the two friends
go head-to-head,

00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:25.358
Hordy's underlings
wreak havoc in the city.

00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:28.695
Still captured at Ryugu Palace,
the rest of the Straw Hats

00:23:28.728 --> 00:23:31.564
launch a very
peculiar escape plan.

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:33.266
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:36.536
"A Rift Opens Up!
Luffy vs. Jimbei!"

00:23:36.569 --> 00:23:38.871
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
