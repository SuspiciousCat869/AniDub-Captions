one more condition.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:16.042
You see, simply put,
you're more powerful

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.109
than I am.

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:19.245
And to be frank,
that makes me nervous.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.147
I am the boss of
this island, after all.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.150
So if you wish to stay here,
I'm gonna need some insurance.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.619
I have no intention
of causing you harm.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:28.320
Whatever you need, I'll do it.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.989
Well then, Law.

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.224
How does this sound to you?

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:34.760
I'm sure you noticed
my dear secretary Monet

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:36.562
sitting over there.

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:40.132
I will entrust you
with her heart.

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.068
Monet? Understood?

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.837
[MONET]
Yes. Fine with me.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.206
And, in exchange,

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:50.376
I hold onto your heart
for safekeeping.

00:11:50.409 --> 00:11:53.512
What do you say, do we
have ourselves a deal?

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.980
This way, we both
have each other by

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.549
the figurative throat.

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:58.851
It ensures that you won't
try anything funny,

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.120
and allows me to rest easy.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:03.889
Shurorororo!

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.259
[CAESAR CLOWN] It's always
a bad idea to put your trust

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:08.461
in others.

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:10.629
Well, you reap what
you sow, right?

00:12:10.663 --> 00:12:13.966
A tough lesson for you
to learn, no doubt.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.901
If you're worried
about your heart,

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.937
Vergo's taking good care of it.

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:26.178
[LAW yells]

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:27.279
[LUFFY]
Hey!

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:28.614
[LAW yells]

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:30.216
I know you're a
rather shrewd man,

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:33.185
but you never thought
to worry about my secretary.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:36.055
Needless to say, she's not the
woman you thought she was.

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.624
And she overheard
your entire plan.

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:39.692
[LAW grunts]

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:44.296
Oh, crap!
You okay, man? Traffy!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.765
[CAESAR CLOWN] I know exactly
what you were plotting

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.899
against me.

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:49.702
I'm so disappointed, Law.
Really.

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:51.303
Here I had gone
and convinced myself

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.372
that I had finally
found a friend.

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.912
So your clever secretary
saved your hide, huh?

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:00.946
Well, fine.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.282
I can admit that I should've
been wary of her.

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:04.517
That one's on me.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.786
I just didn't expect someone
so smart to work

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:07.987
for such a dumbass.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.855
[CAESAR CLOWN growls]

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.690
[LAW yells]

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:13.259
Watch what you say to me!

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.660
Boorish fool!

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:16.128
You're kind of amazing.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:18.998
He took your heart
and you're still alive?

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.800
Undone by your own powers, huh?

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:23.369
That is some record-
breaking stupidity.

00:13:23.402 --> 00:13:25.738
Pathetic. What the hell'd
you do with mine?

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.740
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurorororo!

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:30.142
Oh, do you mean this heart here?

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.512
Poor Smo--

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:34.647
[MONET]
Master.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.650
I've pulled up the video feed,
just as you instructed.

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:38.717
Really?

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.221
Luck is on your side, Smoker.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.223
Shirorororo!

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.296
All right. Let's see it.

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.839
That's candy? It's huge!

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:02.041
This is bad. I know it.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.616
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Shurorororo...

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:16.889
Shurorororo!

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.424
At long last!

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:40.646
[MARINES chattering]

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:41.647
[MARINE I]
Hey!

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.148
There's somethin'
projected up there!

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.150
[MARINE G] The hell's that
thing? Where is it?

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.151
It looks like...

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:49.188
It's candy!
A huge piece of candy!

00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:50.389
[MARINE H]
Well that's weird.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.157
When'd that video
snail get here?

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.900
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Greetings, unlawful brokers.

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:02.468
Thanks for tuning in.

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:05.170
The show will be
starting shortly.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:07.673
A horde of fragmented
Smilies are currently

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:09.842
on route from the Burning Lands.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.044
And soon enough,
they will all converge here

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.980
at this central point of the Ice
Lands.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:18.284
Upon this happy reunion,
they will all merge into one.

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.153
When they do, we'll have
one lovely Smiley,

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.822
huge and deadly.

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:25.891
Then our experiment will begin.

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:55.020
You see, my Smiley,

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:58.991
he's the living incarnation
of the toxic H2S gas.

00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:02.261
In fact, I've already utilized
Smiley once before,

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:05.664
four years ago,
to kill this island!

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.232
It's some kind of gas monster?

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:13.806
There was one problem
with my last test.

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:23.115
Although they were
saturated with poison,

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:26.652
my weakened subjects were
still able to evacuate.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:28.554
A true disappointment.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.110
Now, this time,
I've devised a helpful remedy.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.644
A bit of a boost.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.914
A special meal to stimulate
Smiley's toxic form.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:59.351
It provides an added effect
to his poisonous composition.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:01.387
One that will transform
him into a perfect

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.023
weapon of mass destruction!

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.625
You're about to witness
the birth of a new weapon,

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:10.329
one that I call...
Land of the Dead!

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.606
[ZORO]
They're right behind us!

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.676
Is it even possible to outrun
these damn things?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.281
[BROOK]
It's gaining on us!

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:32.117
[SMILEY roars]

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.453
Aw, crap, it looks like it's
finished forming

00:17:34.486 --> 00:17:35.621
into one blob!

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.256
Perchance one of you could
explain this beast

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:39.224
to me? What is it?

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:40.959
[ZORO]
What difference does it make?

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:43.262
Just keep running!

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.431
[BROOK]
Huh? Do you guys see that?

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.866
Am I hallucinating from fatigue?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.802
Is that a piece of candy?

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:52.538
[SANJI (NAMI)] Seriously,
how dumb can this day get?

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.640
[ZORO] There's people down
there! Beneath it!

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:02.748
[SUBORDINATE E] Master,
we have visual of a large,

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:04.616
gelatinous creature.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.518
I've got a feeling it's Smiley.

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.288
We're preparing the video.

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:11.924
We'll project the feed onto
the fog as planned.

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:15.060
Perfect. Clear the area
once you're done.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.862
And you'll want to do it
quickly because it's about

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.764
to get dangerous out there.

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:20.499
The dragon sled
should do the trick.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:21.433
[SUBORDINATE E gasps]

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.935
Something wrong?

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.503
[SUBORDINATE E]
What is that?

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.637
We've got a problem!

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.873
There's some chemical
melting the sled!

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:29.608
It's completely useless now!

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.009
We're stranded!

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.614
[DRAGON A growls]

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:36.882
[SUBORDINATE F]
How did this even happen?

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:39.184
Where the hell did this
chemical come from?

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:41.386
It's eating right
through the wood!

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.622
[SUBORDINATE E]
No! The dragon's running off!

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:46.492
[SUBORDINATE F] It's one
catastrophe after another!

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:49.194
[CAESAR CLOWN] What?
Oh, my, that's terrible!

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.229
Curses!

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:53.932
I'm so worried for your safety!

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.234
Not convincing.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.936
Listen to me!
You'll have to run for it!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.571
Your suits won't protect
you and they'll just

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:00.806
slow you down!

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:02.207
Quickly, take them off!

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:03.342
And then run to the lab!

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:04.877
As fast as you can!

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.979
[SUBORDINATE E]
What? Well, if you say so!

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.680
[SUBORDINATE F] He wants us
to take off the suits?

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.315
[SUBORDINATE E]
Has the Master ever been wrong?

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.817
He knows what
he's talking about!

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:12.985
Now do as he says!

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:14.186
[SUBORDINATE F]
Right!

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:16.221
[SUBORDINATES chattering]

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.369
[SUBORDINATE E]
Run for it!

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:34.907
[SMILEY growls]

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.776
All right.
Here's hopin' this works!

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.381
[BROOK]
What?

00:19:42.414 --> 00:19:44.016
There's a huge
floating face now!

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:45.851
Is it the ghost of a giant?

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:48.353
Will you quit getting
distracted by other crap?

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.888
Just focus on running!

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:54.426
My sweet Smiley!

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:57.396
How I have longed
to see your face!

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.164
After all these years!

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:02.067
[SMILEY growls]

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.471
That's right!
Oh, Smiley! You remember me!

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.340
It's so good to see you again!

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.075
There's a special
surprise for you,

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:11.543
a delicious snack!

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.745
Not yet!
Wait, Smiley, hold on!

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:17.182
You must be patient
for a moment.

00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.850
Shurorororo!

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.653
There you go, good boy, obey me.

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:23.522
Remember that I'm your master.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:26.491
Wait! I told you to wait!

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:29.361
You and I have so much
catching up to do first.

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:32.631
There was that one time.
Remember?

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:35.867
Yes. It was four years ago!

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.336
[CAESAR CLOWN yells]

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:43.242
Ah... ah... ah--?

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:45.577
Okay.

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.446
Sure, okay, I wanted
you to eat it now,

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.348
good boy!

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:52.117
[MONET] Yeah, he's not
listening to a word you say.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:10.535
[BROOK]
So tired!

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.404
[ZORO]
Why'd it stop chasing us?

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.611
[SMILEY growls]

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:32.791
[CHOPPER]
What is that gross thing?

00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:41.066
Okay. Now what?
It ate the candy.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:51.943
That's a good boy.
Good Smiley.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:54.946
Shuro! Shurorororo!

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.548
It's complete.

00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:59.351
Not a living soul
can stop him now.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:04.790
Shurorororo! Shurorororo!

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:20.472
[NARRATOR] Caesar's ultimate
poison gas weapon once turned

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:23.241
Punk Hazard into a
treacherous land of death.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.078
Now, the murderous substance
threatens to swallow everything

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:29.481
whole and plunge the entire
island into hopeless torment

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:32.250
while Luffy and friends
fight to stay alive.

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:33.919
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:37.189
"The Deadliest Weapon of
Mass Destruction in History!

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:38.557
Land of the Dead!"

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.326
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
