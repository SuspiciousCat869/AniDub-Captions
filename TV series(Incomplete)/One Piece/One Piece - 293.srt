1
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,758
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,295
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,132
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,103
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,306
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,407
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,644
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,246
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,483
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,719
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,122
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,562
He escaped from the Hair Bind?

13
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,397
Rumble.

14
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,702
I'm sorry Doctorine. I can't
keep my word.

15
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,538
Maybe I am just like
the Doctor after all.

16
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,108
If he put his life on the
line to save his country,

17
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,611
then I want to put my life on
the line to save my friends.

18
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,350
If I'm going to die anyway.

19
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,588
I have to try it!
Everyone, please stay away.

20
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,056
I'm about to lose control.

21
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,511
"Bubble Master Kalifa!

22
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,013
The Soap Trap
Closes in on Nami!"

23
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,356
Yoyoi.

24
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,634
No one ever informed me
there was a devil fruit

25
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,203
that would actually
turn one into the devil.

26
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:34,507
But this side of you is
starting to impress me!

27
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,580
Perhaps you are
the devil himself,

28
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,717
or a demon, but a
true man never surrenders,

29
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,584
no matter the odds!

30
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,321
On my very honor
as the lion Kumadori,

31
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,658
I'll send you back to the fires
of hell from whence you came!

32
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,061
Mark my words. Shave!

33
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,329
Now! Finger gun Q, Q, Q!

34
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,375
Moon Walk!

35
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,012
Shishi Kebab!

36
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,195
Yo. Yoyoi.

37
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,664
You've given me no choice.

38
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,333
With this, you shall fall!

39
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,673
Once more Life Return!
Hair Bind!

40
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,189
Hair Bind!

41
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,262
Hair-- Hair Bind!

42
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,601
This is beyond belief.

43
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:08,668
Every inch of my being,

44
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,505
from my sub-consciousness
to the tips of my hair--

45
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,541
--is screaming that I must
escape if I wish to survive,

46
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,078
and they won't shut
up about it either.

47
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,748
But I refuse! I won't flee!

48
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,118
My body will obey! I will fight!

49
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:28,055
Once in a man's life.
Once in a man's life.

50
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,591
Once in a man's life!

51
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,294
He encounters a foe that
his honor demands he face,

52
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:37,131
even though it might
result in his demise.

53
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,465
Shave!

54
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:43,136
Tempest Kick! Lotus!

55
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,609
Cry out! Song of Willow!

56
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,539
Crap.

57
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,077
Doesn't even matter
that I'm super right now.

58
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,178
This week has
kicked my ass ragged.

59
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,350
Oh, well.

60
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:34,054
I'm walkin' away with his key.

61
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,193
Number 4, huh?

62
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,296
Don't the swordsman and
the nose need number 2?

63
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,430
That's what the deer said.

64
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,768
If this guy had number 4,
and that guy had number 3.

65
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,204
Well that narrows
things down some.

66
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,305
That can only mean

67
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,275
that secretary lookin'
gal has the number two key.

68
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,343
I better hurry up and find her.

69
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,012
Those guys really need my help.

70
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,538
I was under the impression
that you were short on time.

71
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:25,773
If that were the case,

72
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,775
it would seem you
aren't trying very hard.

73
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,477
But perhaps this is
all part of your plan.

74
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,816
Don't you mock me.
You'll pay for this!

75
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,452
Sounds great.
I'm ready when you are.

76
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,721
You don't have to
wait for me, y'know?

77
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,657
The battle has already
started, after all.

78
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,492
Arrogant, aren't you?

79
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,161
I mean, you ate a devil fruit.

80
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,663
So that bath is
disabling your power.

81
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,597
If your body's half submerged.

82
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,367
I can't imagine you
can do much damage.

83
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,735
Oh yeah?

84
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,138
You think I'm so cocky
I'd drop my guard?

85
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,577
Don't worry about me.

86
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,047
Even without my powers,
I'm still better off than you.

87
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:17,791
Pardon me a moment.

88
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,793
Just what the hell
did you do to me?

89
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,698
It would spoil it
if I told you now!

90
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,166
Solving that mystery is part

91
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,435
of the fun of fighting
a power holder.

92
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,210
Whatever it was that
happened to Sanji,

93
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,113
she's obviously the
one who's behind it.

94
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,547
I've gotta be careful.

95
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,116
Otherwise I'll end
up just like him.

96
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,788
I'm finally starting to
get some strength back.

97
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,163
So you think I'm weak, huh?

98
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:59,099
Well, you haven't seen
the Perfect Clima Tact yet.

99
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,601
If you think I'm
just a pretty face,

100
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,736
you're in for a world of hurt.

101
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,375
I can move my legs.

102
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:18,151
Here it comes. Thunder Charge!

103
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,122
Swing Arm!

104
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,605
That's an impressive weapon.

105
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,445
Are those clouds?

106
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,449
Did you think I'd just lie there
and let you stomp on me?

107
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:54,354
Here's my Thunder Bolt Tempo!

108
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:09,269
And that's what happens when
you don't take me seriously.

109
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,693
What an interesting surprise!

110
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:35,662
I never thought I'd get
struck by lightning indoors.

111
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,866
Damn.

112
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,235
That barrier protected her,
but what was it made of?

113
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,236
It looked like it
turned into bubbles.

114
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,205
You better hurry
and figure that out.

115
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,475
It's your only
chance of defeating me.

116
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,445
I shouldn't tease you like
that--you'll never guess.

117
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,181
It was almost like soap
when you washed it away.

118
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,683
Did you eat some kind
of bubble-bubble fruit?

119
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,785
Is that it?

120
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,188
Well! Still!

121
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,756
Even if you do know
what my power does,

122
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,559
that doesn't mean you're
stronger than me or anything.

123
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,827
Understand?

124
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,063
Talk about defensive.

125
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,364
I almost feel bad for her.

126
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,301
To put it one way.
My power is cleanliness.

127
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:18,105
I'm a soap human thanks
to the Bubble-Bubble fruit.

128
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,740
So my entire body
produces a lather.

129
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,379
Lovely, isn't it?

130
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,381
Whoa. How sexy.

131
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,350
I wish I had a
secretary like her--

132
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,084
wait, I'm talking
like an old man!

133
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,154
Uh. It seems pretty
useless for fighting though!

134
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,056
So, what, do you
make people slip?

135
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:36,923
The sea of bubbles

136
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,159
that I create obey
my every command.

137
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,261
And I have quite
the imagination!

138
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:46,834
What the--?

139
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,702
I'll give you an example.

140
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,770
So she wasn't
just taking a bath!

141
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,208
Bubble Master Soap Sheep!

142
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,480
What?

143
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,483
Beautiful, huh?

144
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah, some imagination.

145
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,056
Don't let the fluffy
appearance fool you.

146
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:15,429
Sheep Cloud Relaxing Bubbles!

147
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,430
Oh. By the way.

148
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,798
Didn't you wonder why
you lost your strength

149
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,500
when you walked in here?

150
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,468
Of course.

151
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,637
That must have had something
to do with her power.

152
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,072
What else could it be?

153
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,607
Now that I think about it,

154
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,108
when I came through the door.

155
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:34,147
The floor was
covered with bubbles.

156
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,451
Oh, crap!

157
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,659
You took too long
to figure it out.

158
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,764
My strength is fading, again.

159
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,833
It's just like earlier

160
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,068
when I stepped on
that puddle of bubbles.

161
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,870
Give it some time.

162
00:13:56,904 --> 00:14:00,407
You'll soon understand the
true horror of this power.

163
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,253
The bubbles that come
from my body are thorough.

164
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,788
They scour and clean
anything you can think of.

165
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,224
Dirt and general filth,
of course.

166
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,493
As well, as your strength.

167
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,429
Perhaps you need to be
reminded of something.

168
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,164
I'm not just a secretary,

169
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,100
I'm one of the world's
most deadly assassins.

170
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,504
I can move again.

171
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,340
Maybe it's because
the bubbles disappeared.

172
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm done with your crap.
Thunder Ball!

173
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,483
That weapon is interesting.

174
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,718
But it won't be enough.

175
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,708
My strength is fading, again.

176
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,611
It's just like earlier
when I stepped on that

177
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,078
puddle of bubbles.

178
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,547
Give it some time.

179
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,450
You'll soon understand the
true horror of this power.

180
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,729
The bubbles that come
from my body are thorough.

181
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,265
They scour and clean
anything you can think of.

182
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,200
Dirt and general
filth, of course.

183
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,136
As well, as your strength.

184
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,272
Perhaps you need to be
reminded of something.

185
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,474
I'm not just a secretary,

186
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,243
I'm one of the world's
most deadly assassins.

187
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,513
I can move again.

188
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,182
Maybe it's because
the bubbles disappeared.

189
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,653
I'm done with your crap.
Thunder Ball!

190
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,626
That weapon is interesting.

191
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,460
But it won't be enough.

192
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,098
Golden Bubbles!

193
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:14,608
What're you doing?

194
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,776
My legs. I can't stand.

195
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,480
What'd you--
What'd you do to me?

196
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,085
Pretty, aren't they?

197
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,688
My lightest touch can
make anything glisten.

198
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,291
It's my gift to make
everything beautiful.

199
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,093
I'll give your skin a
luminescent sheen.

200
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:36,696
Every inch of your body
will shimmer from my touch.

201
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,656
Iron Bod--

202
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,683
I got no idea what kind
of junk is waiting for me.

203
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,785
As soon as I get back up,
I better get me some cola.

204
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,087
Oh, right.

205
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,489
I wonder if that deer's
still hangin' in there.

206
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,728
What's goin' on up there?

207
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:29,209
Wh--what the hell--

208
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,510
--is that?

209
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,816
Wait.

210
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,720
That's the CP9 guy that
got locked in the fridge.

211
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,023
That thing's holding
him like a ragdoll.

212
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,500
What the hell did I miss?

213
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,207
That hat.

214
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,110
I think it's the same style
that deer was wearing.

215
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,678
Hey! You!

216
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,380
You're not that
deer-gorilla, right?

217
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,164
This can't be real.

218
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:29,637
No, it's him, alright.
It's Kumadori!

219
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,673
His body came rocketing
over from the Tower of Law!

220
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,275
But who could've
done that to him?

221
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,114
Seriously. What the
hell is his problem?

222
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,198
A voice?

223
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,338
Hey! Keep movin'.

224
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,541
I don't remember telling
you to stop, Nico Robin.

225
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,644
Hey! Are you listening to me?

226
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,246
Don't forget
who's the boss here!

227
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,449
Alright, Lucci. Just drag her!

228
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:22,122
Pull her by the hair
if you have to!

229
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,625
It's an order. Now come on.

230
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,393
Start walking.

231
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,497
You're delusional, aren't you?

232
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,334
Oh, my. You're honestly
convinced that the Straw Hats

233
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:38,672
are still on their way
to rescue you. Moron!

234
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,275
I've never seen such
a weak-looking pirate crew.

235
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,078
If that's your only hope,
that's pretty sad.

236
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,379
That explosion we heard earlier

237
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,414
was probably the
pipes or something.

238
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,717
There's no way they
could make it this far!

239
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,652
While you're off in your
little fantasy world,

240
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,320
dreaming of being rescued,

241
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,422
we'll pass the Gates of Justice.

242
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,259
The Bridge of
Hesitation lies right

243
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,160
before the Gates of Justice.

244
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:03,097
We'll cross the first
elevated half of the bridge.

245
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,499
And once the gates
are within our sight,

246
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,569
the other half of the bridge
will rise from the sea.

247
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,106
And then we'll finally pass
through the gates themselves.

248
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,341
Once the gates have
firmly closed behind us,

249
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,510
every lingering trace
of your pathetic,

250
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:20,314
misguided optimism will
be dashed to pieces.

251
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,650
You'll forget what
hope even means.

252
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,685
The only feeling left
in your body will be

253
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:27,588
an overwhelming and
eternal sense of guilt.

254
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,224
You will spend your days
in ceaseless atonement

255
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:32,426
for your arrogant
crime of existing.

256
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,129
You know it's true. Nico Robin.

257
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,485
Now then. Hurry along.

258
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,054
Move your feet, wench!

259
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:15,402
Robin! Robin! Robin!

260
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,210
Wh-wh-what was that?

261
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:25,179
I heard someone!
Did you hear that?

262
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,680
Who was it?

263
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,685
You better take
Nico Robin and start moving.

264
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:34,187
Don't worry, chief,
I'll handle this.

265
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:38,492
A door!

266
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:42,562
At least it doesn't look like
it's made of iron this time.

267
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:59,346
It's big in here. Where am I?

268
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,315
I found you, Pigeon-bastard.

269
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,620
Glad you could make it.

270
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,562
Hey! Answer me! CP9!

271
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,731
One of the pirates caught
up with us somehow.

272
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:20,434
Come on! Are you even
listening to me?

273
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,569
Wait! No!

274
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:22,803
Look at what you're holding!

275
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:23,971
What?

276
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:28,742
I pressed the button on the
golden transponder snail!

277
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,477
On the next One Piece:

278
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,114
"Resounding Bad News!
Buster Call Invoked!"

279
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,516
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
