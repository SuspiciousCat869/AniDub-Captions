for the treasure One Piece

must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

For the rest of the

this has proven to be
the end of the road.

the mad scientist Caesar Clown.

Aided by Trafalgar Law

The only thing I told you to do

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.840
was not fraternize
with the pirates.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.842

way to enforce that!

There's a reason I told

I talked a big game
about saving them,

I have a bad history
with most Marines,

it's a different story.

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:26.525
[MARINE J]
Vice Admiral Smokey!

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.595
We're takin' a team
back to Caesar's lab!

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:30.662
What happened?

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:33.532
We forced Caesar to
tell us the gas's weakness!

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.801
All our guys're still alive!

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.603
We're headin'
back to rescue 'em!

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:42.007
What the...? How is
Smoker still alive?

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.809
[MARINE J]
Let's go get 'em, guys!

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.244
[MARINES]
Yeah!

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.712
[SMOKER]
Huh.

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:50.782
[footsteps]

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.457
[CHILDREN chattering]

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.760
[SMOKER] Law, frankly,
although I made you a promise,

00:21:01.793 --> 00:21:04.730
you can't possibly
expect me to keep it.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.732
You're a pirate.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.600
But if you wanted to silence me,

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:11.503
you had plenty of
opportunities to do it earlier.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:17.476
What exactly are you
plannin', using Straw Hat?

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:22.347
Using him? What makes you
think he's not using me? Heh.

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:32.291
[LUFFY] Well, there's four of
'em, right? So which one is it?

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.873
If you really need to know,

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:50.709
I'm talking about Kaido,
King of the Beasts.

00:21:52.244 --> 00:21:53.845
[gasps]

00:21:56.114 --> 00:22:02.254
Hah. Sure, as long as Shanks
isn't first, I'm cool with that.

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:05.590
[LUFFY chuckles]
And besides,

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:09.528
I'm already plannin' on crushin'
all Four Emperors anyway.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.371
[NARRATOR] At last, the
time to depart has arrived.

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:21.973
After farewells are exchanged
with the rescued children

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.575
and the G-Five soldiers,

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:26.745
Luffy lets out a triumphant
shout to set sail.

00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:29.648
Meanwhile, Doflamingo
draws nearer and nearer,

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:32.851
his vile clutches threatening
to ensnare our heroes.

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:34.720
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:38.223
"It's Time to Say Goodbye!
Leaving Punk Hazard!"

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:41.126
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
