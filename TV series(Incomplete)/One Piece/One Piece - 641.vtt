00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.013
[laughing]

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.222
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.672
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:46.166
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.369
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:52.011
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.319
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:58.824
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:03.801
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.470
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.978
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.119
Iâ€™m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.498
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.672
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:25.778
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made Devil Fruit

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.116
Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.755
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.292
with the Flame-Flame
Fruit as a prize.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:35.698
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Robin and
Usopp attempt to hand over

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:37.234
Caesar on Green Bit,

00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:41.208
when they encounter the Navy
and a group of tiny people.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:45.551
Now, Mil Fleurs!
Campo de Flores!

00:03:45.584 --> 00:03:46.854
[DWARVES shout]

00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:48.056
[KABU yelps]

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:49.292
I caught one!

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:51.564
[gasps]
Caught one what?

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.734
It's a... person!

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:56.305
[NARRATOR] Sanji, entranced by
a woman named Violet,

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:58.376
was lured into a deadly ambush,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.950
where his would-be lover reveals
the heart-breaking truth.

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:05.558
[VIOLET] You're nothing but
a failure, Black Leg Sanji.

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.893
Be reasonable.

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:10.467
How would a worm like you win
the heart of a woman like me?

00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:13.508
[chuckles]
What a joke.

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:17.448
Violet. Tell me it's not true.
You wouldn't do this!

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.884
[gasps]

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:21.557
[SANJI grunts]
I'm thinking of you.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.758
[VIOLET]
Huh?

00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:27.467
About the way you looked at me.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.875
I knew that...
you weren't lying!

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:33.581
[SANJI grunts]
No matter what you say.

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:37.556
No matter what anyone says,
I believe in you.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:42.031
For me, a girl's tears are
always enough proof!

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:43.734
[gasps]

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.438
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
Ha! This guy must think

00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:04.108
he's in a romance novel.

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.513
I've never heard
such cheesy crap.

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:07.882
[PIRATE A]
I mean, there's "desperate"

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:09.251
and then there's "crazy."

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:11.657
[PIRATE B]
You gotta face reality, man.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.665
She pulled one over on you.
That's all there is to it.

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:16.800
[VIOLET sobs]

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:19.471
[PIRATE C]
Whatever. He doesn't get it.

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:22.177
Listen, if you're done with
this delusional moron,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.216
we'd be more than happy
to finish him off for ya.

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:29.659
[VIOLET grunts]

00:05:29.692 --> 00:05:31.196
[PIRATES laugh]

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.570
All right then, that looks
like a "yes" to me!

00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:36.974
This guy's worth 77 million!

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:40.480
Looks like it's the end
of Black Leg Sanji.

00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:42.350
Prepare to die!

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.925
Hierro Lagrima!

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.633
Hang on, Lady. Stop!

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.268
And Eye Whale!

00:05:51.737 --> 00:05:55.243
[PIRATES gasp, yell]

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:57.113
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
She's serious, you guys!

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.190
[PIRATES yell]

00:06:02.224 --> 00:06:03.661
[SANJI grunts]
What are you doing?

00:06:03.694 --> 00:06:04.529
[gasps]

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:06.366
[VIOLET]
Eye Whale!

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:11.375
[PIRATES shouting]

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.105
[SANJI]
I get it now.

00:06:26.138 --> 00:06:29.545
You were forced to work
with Doflamingo, weren't you?

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.654
[SANJI gasps]

00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:36.092
[VIOLET] You need to get
away from here, Black Leg.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:37.995
Then what about you?
How could I?

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:39.733
I'm fine! Forget me!

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.536
Don't say that!

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.742
[VIOLET]
We know everything.

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:46.846
There's no way your
plan will work.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.651
You're walking straight
into a trap.

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:49.852
[gasps]

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:55.631
[VIOLET] You were trying to
protect one of your own enemies.

00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:57.535
[VIOLET]
You're hopeless.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.340
I don't know why
you believed in me.

00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:01.543
[gasps]

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:04.181
[VIOLET]
But thank you.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.757
It made me happy.

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:11.362
[grunts] I don't know
the whole story here,

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.401
but if you don't want to work
for Doflamingo, then leave!

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:16.238
You already attacked
your own men!

00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:18.677
Just come with me and
we'll escape together!

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.720
[VIOLET whimpers]

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:29.766
[VIOLET grunts]
Look into my eyes, Black Leg.

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:30.801
[SANJI gasps]

00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:32.471
From the moment you
came here with Caesar,

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:34.408
your crew's fate was sealed.

00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:37.047
Everything is following
Doflamingo's plan.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.115
His plan?

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:41.422
Yes. Gaze into my mind
and you will understand.

00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:44.194
That's something I can do?

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:51.409
[SANJI gasps]

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:54.047
[VIOLET] Here's my memory
of Dressrosa this morning.

00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.824
[SANJI grunts]
It can't be.

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:02.197
[SANJI]
How?

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:07.642
[SANJI]
This is bad.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:08.743
[CROWD cheers]

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.548
[GYATS]
We're only in the third set,

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:13.754
but we've already seen some
incredible competitors today!

00:08:13.787 --> 00:08:15.959
Burgess showed his
might in Block A,

00:08:15.992 --> 00:08:18.263
and much to the chagrin
of everyone here,

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:22.203
Bartolomeo humiliated the other
competitors in Block B!

00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:26.312
Now, we have fresh chaos and
carnage lined up in Block C!

00:08:26.345 --> 00:08:28.015
The competitors are all lined up

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.086
and it seems they're
eager to start!

00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.290
You got that right!
I'm sick of waiting around!

00:08:32.323 --> 00:08:34.796

Hm? Who's there?

00:08:40.574 --> 00:08:44.415

[BULL grunts]

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:49.693
[LUFFY chuckles]
I know how you're feeling!

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:50.862
I can't wait, either!

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:52.531
[COMPETITOR A]
Stop shoving, jackass!

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:54.769
[COMPETITOR B]
It's not me! Shut the hell up!

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:56.940
[COMPETITOR C] Is someone
trying to run us over or what?

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:59.145
Okay-- Whoa!

[CHIN JAO grunts]

00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.687
I tire of this monotony.
Let's fight.

00:09:05.157 --> 00:09:07.027
[KELLY] You're gonna get
stomped out there, old man.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.429
Go home while you still can!

How dare you!

00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:11.235
You wanna say that again, punk?

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:12.538
[KELLY]
Sure!

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.742
You're grandpa is gonna get
his ass kicked, just like you!

00:09:14.776 --> 00:09:17.413
Whoa, whoa, brother,
take it easy!

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:20.655
It's meaningless to run your
mouth before the battle.

00:09:20.688 --> 00:09:23.794
Your skills, or rather,
lack thereof,

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:27.334
will become apparent
soon enough, shrimp.

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.471
[KELLY] Listen up,
you geriatric fatass--

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:32.110

[GYATS] Keep your eyes
peeled for famous faces!

Just like our last two matches,

Block C is bursting at the seams
with formidable contenders!

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:20.841
I guarantee, this is
gonna be a good one!

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:24.716
One of the men standing here
could advance to the finals

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:29.024
and inherit the legacy
of Fire-Fist Ace!

Be wary of the police!

[FRANKY]
You're a soldier, aren't you?

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.456
Why are you afraid
of the police?

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.927
Wait, who is that?

[TOY SOLDIER] I saw the list of
competitors in the coliseum.

00:12:29.198 --> 00:12:33.540
I asked you not to enter.
Why did you do it?

00:12:33.573 --> 00:12:35.878

Because...

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:40.453
Because I'll win!
You'll see! I promise!

but you shouldn't
make a girl cry.

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.397
[REBECCA gasps]

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.842
That's why we must hurry.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:37.266
I know I'm just a toy,
but I must protect her.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.114
[TOY SOLDIER]
These useless tin eyes of mine

00:13:44.147 --> 00:13:46.753
can't even shed a tear for her.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:50.861
[sniffs]

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:04.755
[USOPP]
Robin, what's going on?

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:06.592
You're kinda weirding
me out here.

00:14:06.626 --> 00:14:08.596
What's this about a
"little person?"

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.066
[ROBIN]
I have one in my hand.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.439
Huh? If that's supposed to be
a joke, then I don't get it.

00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:15.878
Anyway, there's no
Marines here, right?

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:18.049
It looks like the
coast is clear.

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:21.455
Those Marines.
You robbed them, didn't you?

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.699
[gasps]

00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:29.939
[BOMBA] We better figure
out something, quick!

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:30.975
[ROBIN gasps]

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:32.678
Okay, let's see this
"little person" of yo--

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:35.083
H-He's real!

00:14:35.116 --> 00:14:37.622
[ROBIN] I think there are more
of them, and close by, too.

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.191
[USOPP]
Wait, what?

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.428
I heard someone
talking just now.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.604
[KABU]
Huh?

00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:47.340
[LEO]
Anesthetic Flowers!

00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:49.244
[ROBIN gasps]

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:51.550
[grunts]

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:52.551
What's this smoke?

00:14:52.585 --> 00:14:54.420
[exhales]

00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:58.797
Whoa! Are you okay?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.999
Robi--

00:15:04.074 --> 00:15:05.678
Usopp.

00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:08.449
[snores]

00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:11.656
[KABU]
She'll fall asleep soon enough.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.092
[LEO]
What should we do with them?

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:14.795
Are they enemies?

00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:18.136
Doesn't matter, they saw us
so there's only one answer.

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:20.006
We must eliminate them!

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.076
[ROBIN exhales]

00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:56.980
[BOMBA]
What's in her bag?

00:15:57.013 --> 00:15:58.917
[DWARF A]
A couple books. Some clothes.

00:15:58.951 --> 00:16:00.220
[DWARF B]
Candy!

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:01.823
[DWARF C]
A transponder snail!

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.994
[BOMBA]
Double check for any weapons!

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:06.265
[DWARF D]
There must be something on her!

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.468
[DWARF E]
Search inside her clothes!

00:16:12.344 --> 00:16:14.013
[DWARF D]
Point C all clear.

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:15.382
[BOMBA]
Roger.

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:17.119
[DWARF C]
Point A all clear.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:18.322
[BOMBA]
Roger!

00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:25.504
[LEO] No hidden weapons
at Point B, either.

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:27.140
[ROBIN gasps]

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:28.442
[LEO]
Mm?

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:31.014
[ROBIN, LEO gasp]

00:16:32.216 --> 00:16:34.522
[DWARVES yell]

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:36.324
[RANPO]
She's awake!

00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:40.600
Weapons ready!

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:41.836
[DWARVES]
Okay!

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.474
[ROBIN gasps]
Let's not be hasty!

00:16:44.508 --> 00:16:48.348
Don't try to run!
No funny business!

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:51.522
I see. They've pinned
my body to the ground.

00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:54.896
[LEO] You'll only hurt
yourself if you move.

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:56.999
I sewed you nice and
snug with my magical

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:59.839
Stitch-Stitch Power,
so you're not going anywhere!

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:01.543
[ROBIN]
That sounds rather handy.

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:02.645
It is!

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:04.481
Once someone gets a
taste of my trusty needle,

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:06.418
they can't move an inch!

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:09.390
You Big People were up to
no good again, weren't you?

00:17:09.424 --> 00:17:12.598
There's been a mistake.
I swear I'm not your enemy.

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.636
In fact, I don't even
know who you are.

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:19.177
I'm Leo of the
Tontatta Tribe! A warrior!

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.685
Leo. All right, then could
you tell me where we are?

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:23.953
And where's Usopp?

00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:26.358
Ah. I mean,
the other big person.

00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:27.794
He's not here?

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:30.834
[ROBIN]
Is he all right?

00:17:33.105 --> 00:17:35.711
Your tall friend with
the long-nose, you mean?

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:36.913
We captured him too,

00:17:36.947 --> 00:17:38.950
in accordance with
our kingdom's rules.

00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:42.123
So this is a country where only
little people like you live?

00:17:42.156 --> 00:17:45.129
[LEO] Indeed. This place is
known as the Tontatta Kingdom.

00:17:45.162 --> 00:17:47.467
It lies beneath the Great Forest
which we proudly made

00:17:47.502 --> 00:17:48.970
with our own hands!

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:51.943
[ROBIN] The Great Forest?
Oh you mean Green Bit!

00:17:51.976 --> 00:17:54.080
So you grow those giant plants.

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:56.051
The ones that cover
the whole island

00:17:56.084 --> 00:17:57.253
That's right.

00:17:57.286 --> 00:18:00.594
There's no plant, great or small
the Tontatta can't grow!

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:02.130
Everyone, watch out!

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:03.132
Kabu?

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.635
She has a strange power!

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:07.775
She can sprout hands and arms
like flowers on the ground!

00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:09.144
Flower hands?

00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:11.482
We've never grown
hand flowers before!

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:12.718
That sounds real creepy!

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.722
Yeah. It must be magic.

00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:17.127
It's the strangest thing
that I've ever seen!

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.495
They're fast, too!

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.769
Snatched me up
before I could run!

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:23.973
[ROBIN]
All right, that's something.

00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:27.614
They must have carried me here
after that gas made me pass out.

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:34.361
[ROBIN] I could probably
use my power to escape,

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:37.701
but it might cause them to panic
and do something stupid.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.715
So spit it out!
What are you up to?

00:18:44.748 --> 00:18:47.521
You've come to destroy
our kingdom, haven't you?

00:18:47.554 --> 00:18:48.757
Not at all!

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.892
I grabbed your friend,

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:52.263
but I only did so out
of sheer curiosity!

00:18:52.296 --> 00:18:54.200
It doesn't matter
why you did it.

00:18:54.234 --> 00:18:57.373
Big People are not allowed to
see the Tontatta for any reason!

00:18:57.407 --> 00:19:00.113
As the law states,
you must be put to death!

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:03.954
But why? Whatever grudge
you hold, I have no part of it.

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:05.924
And if you must keep
your existence a secret,

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.895
I swear I won't tell
a soul we met!

00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:10.801
You're lying! I refuse to
listen to your excuses!

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:11.770
[ROBIN]
But I mean it!

00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:13.071
[gasps]

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.944
'Kay then, I'll let you go!

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.650
[ROBIN]
What?

00:19:18.683 --> 00:19:20.654
Wow, that sure is a relief, huh?

00:19:20.688 --> 00:19:22.424
She's not evil after all!

00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:24.227
[DWARF I, J]
She gets to live!

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:27.367
[ROBIN]
That's all it took?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.239
[DWARVES laughing]

00:19:30.273 --> 00:19:33.045
[ROBIN]
They certainly are trusting!

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:34.414
[LEO]
You can get up now.

00:19:34.447 --> 00:19:35.449
[ROBIN gasps]

00:19:35.482 --> 00:19:38.088
Here! Take your sunglasses, too!

00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:39.625
Why thank you.

00:19:40.895 --> 00:19:42.464
[GANCHO]
Hey, Leo.

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:43.600
Oh, hello, Chief!

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:45.871
Stop! You can't release her!

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:46.873
[LEO]
Don't worry,

00:19:46.906 --> 00:19:48.910
she said she'll keep
everything a secret!

00:19:48.943 --> 00:19:50.881
And why would you believe her?

00:19:50.914 --> 00:19:52.985
[LEO] She said she
means it, so it's true.

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:56.491
What?! 'Kay then, works for me.

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:59.965
[ROBIN] Are they all like this?
It is rather convenient, though.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.702
[GANCHO]
Hm. Pardon our stares,

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:05.109
it's not often we get to see
a Big Person close up, see?

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:05.977
[ROBIN]
Who are you?

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.548
[GANCHO]
The name is Gancho.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.117
I'm known as the Tonta-chief,

00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:11.455
which is what we call
our king around here.

00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:14.796
Welcome! You can stay
as long as you like!

00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:17.099
Hi! Nice to meet you!

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.070
Would you like to try
some simmered pumpkin?

00:20:19.103 --> 00:20:23.044
Ha! That's so kind of you,
but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:27.019
Hey you, over here!
We just baked tree sap cookies!

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.556
You wanna taste one?

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.128
We're having tea!
You're welcome to join us.

00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.432
[ROBIN]
I'm sorry, but I really must go.

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:35.670
We've got some grilled
mushrooms to share!

00:20:35.704 --> 00:20:37.273
Heh!

00:20:37.307 --> 00:20:38.342
Excuse me.

00:20:38.376 --> 00:20:40.713
But do you know where my
transponder snail went?

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:44.789
[DWARF N] Right here!
I released it into the wild!

00:20:44.822 --> 00:20:49.699
[gasps] This is bad.
It's not long until three.

00:20:49.732 --> 00:20:54.474
I have to contact Law quickly.
The exit. Where is it?

00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:57.480
Wait a sec! You can't
be leaving already!

00:20:57.514 --> 00:20:59.117
And here I thought
you were nice!

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.622
If you leave, then hand over
your weapon before you go!

00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:03.058
That's the rule!

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:04.460
I don't have one.

00:21:04.493 --> 00:21:06.900
Give us a weapon, or we'll
take everything you've got!

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.870
I said I don't have one!

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.115
[LEO]
Then you leave me no choice.

00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:16.685
[ROBIN]
Huh? Ah!

00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:22.396
[LEO]
We're gonna bleed you dry.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:24.869
Take it all!

00:21:24.902 --> 00:21:26.070
[gasps]

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.878
[gasps]
My sunglasses? They're gone?

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.916
[ROBIN gasps]

00:21:31.949 --> 00:21:33.085
[LEO]
Go!

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:35.455
[DWARVES, ROBIN shouting]

00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:38.697
[FLAPPER]
No! Wait! Stop it!

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.432
Is there an emergency?

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:49.117
You can't be mean to her!
Her partner is the great hero!

00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:50.721
[DWARVES]
What?

00:21:50.754 --> 00:21:52.724
The... hero?

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:54.027
[ROBIN]
Usopp?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.699
But where did you hear this?
I don't get it.

00:21:56.733 --> 00:21:59.270
The Person with the
long nose told me,

00:21:59.303 --> 00:22:01.307
and he said he meant it, too!

00:22:01.341 --> 00:22:05.517
He's the legendary hero,
come to save us at last!

00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:09.190
Finally. Finally...

00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:12.631
The hero came just when
we needed him most!

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:15.235
[DWARF I]
Yay!

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:16.405
[DWARF A]
Awesome!

00:22:16.438 --> 00:22:18.442
[LEO]
I wanna meet him!

00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:21.014
[ROBIN]
Usopp, what did you tell them?

00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:24.354
[DWARVES laughing, chattering]

00:22:24.387 --> 00:22:27.761
[ROBIN]
It's 2:57. We're out of time.

00:22:31.936 --> 00:22:34.608
[NARRATOR]
Indeed, the clock is ticking.

00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:37.747
The time to trade off Caesar
is fast approaching.

00:22:38.883 --> 00:22:43.527
[NARRATOR]
Two minutes. And counting.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.536
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A rings]

00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:52.945
[SANJI]
You there, Law? It's Sanji!

00:22:52.978 --> 00:22:54.314
Where'd you run off to?

00:22:54.347 --> 00:22:56.118
Please tell me you
found the Factory.

00:22:56.151 --> 00:22:57.922
[SANJI] That's the least
of our worries now!

00:22:57.955 --> 00:22:59.625
[LAW]
Hm? What's wrong?

00:22:59.658 --> 00:23:00.827
[SANJI]
It's a trap!

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.365
You gotta get outta there
before it's too late!

00:23:03.398 --> 00:23:04.768
[gasps]

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:17.059
[NARRATOR]
The Block C battle is underway.

00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:18.997
The crowd explodes
with excitement

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.267
as Luffy defeats foe after foe.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.140
Elsewhere, Law finds himself
helpless when he discovers

00:23:24.173 --> 00:23:27.914
that Doflamingo has executed
a cruel and cunning deception,

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:30.820
which poses a dire
threat to Dressrosa.

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.390
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.423 --> 00:23:36.298
"The Strategem of the Century!
Doflamingo Makes His Move!"

00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:38.769
[LUFFY] I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
