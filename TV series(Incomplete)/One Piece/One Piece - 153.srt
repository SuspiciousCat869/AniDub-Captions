[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:49,039
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,543
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:57,213
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

6
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,305

7
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,682
<i>I left behind those</i>

8
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:12,228
<i>For the endless,</i>

9

10

<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:25,784
<i>See the light I have searched</i>

12
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:28,286

00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:35,919
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:40,965

<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:47,889
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:50,350
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:53,645
<i>For the horizon</i>

21
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:55,897

Everyone hold on or get inside!

It's being lifted up!

[NAMI]
Spread the sails! Right now!

33
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,066
Sure it's a pillar of water,
but it's still part of the sea.

34
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,902
Trust me. I'm a
navigator, aren't I?

35
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,071
Thank you, Nami!

[LUFFY]
We're flying!

37
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,453
Yeah! We're headed to the sky!

38
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:54,247
I can't wait to find out
what's up in the sky!

39
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,791
Let's bust through
'em and find out!

What they got is lucky.

48
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:47,092
So what? We're just gonna sit
here and let 'em escape?

49
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,427
We just lost 160-
million-Berry bounty

50
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,637
and you're laughin' about it?

51

53
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,935
Easy, Burgess. They
haven't left this world.

54
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,562
They'll be back. We'll
meet them soon enough,

55
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:02,065
as long as we stay
on the Grand Line.

56
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:05,777
This is true. We are but
cogs in the gears of fate.

57
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,696
And though they've managed
to escape us today,

58
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,698
they cannot outrun destiny.

What just happened to us?

Hey! Look, guys!
Out there! What is that?

00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,402
[SANJI]
What in the world?

68
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,320
[LUFFY]
It's solid white!

69
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:50,321
They're clouds!

70
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,991
But how? Why aren't we falling?

71
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,118
[LUFFY] Clouds float.
Boats float. Same thing!

No, it's not!

He's not?

[SANJI]
Right!

77
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,670
I'll do mouth-to-mouth on Nami!

Moron.

79
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,923
[CHOPPER]
Usopp! Come on, speak to me!

80
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,135

He's alive!

81
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,720
I am?

83
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,389
[USOPP]
Then where are we?!

84
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:17,766
What's with all these clouds?!

85
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,017
They're everywhere!

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,479
Basically, it's...
it's an ocean in the sky.

87
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,023
No way. Seriously?

88
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,943
[NAMI] But look, the Log
Pose is still pointing up.

89
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,570
So we must still be
somewhere in the middle

90
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,155
of the cumuloregalis cloud.

91
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,449
Wait, you mean we have
to travel even higher?

92
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:36,493
That's what the Log
Pose says, at least.

93
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,119
Did I hear you call me a moron?

94
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,537
[ZORO]
I dunno, didja?

95
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,247
An ocean!

--[LUFFY] Go, Usopp!
--Hey, you can't swim here!

101
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,051
We still don't know
anything about this place.

102
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,010
Watch me!

103
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:57,389
[laughing]

104
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:58,473
He did it!

105
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:00,558
He's so brave!

106
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,315
[USOPP]
It's hard to see anything,

107
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,192
but I'm really moving!

108
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:12,153
There's so little resistance!

109
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:16,825
Wow, I'm just going deeper
and deeper. It's so easy!

110
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:19,661
Aw, man. It's no fair.

111
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,788
I wish I could swim like that.

112
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,541
I bet it's the
funnest thing ever.

113
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:34,342
Hey, uh... He's not
comin' back up.

114
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,763
You know, it's possible

115
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,558
this ocean may not
have an actual bottom.

116
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,934
Say what?

117
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,811
Idiot! Did that fool just
fall through the clouds?

118
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,479
Usopp!

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,274
I just told him
not to go in there!

120
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,151
Luffy! Stretch out
as far as you can!

121
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,944
I am! But I can't
see where he is!

122
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,071
Just leave that part to me!

123
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,990
Ojos Fleur!

124
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:21,598
[ROBIN]
There he is!

125
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,224
[LUFFY]
What? Where?

126
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,270
[ROBIN]
Vente Fleur!

127
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,984
[grunts]

128
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,569
Okay. Now pull him up.

129
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,112
All right, I got him!

130
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,948
[grunting]

131
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:40,450
[CHOPPER]
Is he heavy?

132
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:43,328
[ROBIN]
He shouldn't be that heavy.

133
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:44,245
[CHOPPER]
C'mon, Luffy!

134
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,789
Pull harder!

135
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,044
Yes! He's back! Huh?

136
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:53,046
[LUFFY]
But he's not alone!

137
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,047
[NAMI screams]

138
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,632
[SANJI]
They're trying to eat him!

139
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,801
[BOTH screaming]

140
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,304
[ZORO]
You hungry? Eat this!

141
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,434
Huh?

142
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:30,875
This air, it's so thin.

143
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,043
It's hard to breathe.

144
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:33,420
[SANJI]
What do you make of this?

145
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:35,380
It's the strangest
creature I've ever seen.

146
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:37,465
I'm not even sure it's a fish.

147
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,135
[LUFFY] That octopus thing
was more like a big balloon.

148
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,178
[ZORO] Yeah, except balloons
don't have teeth.

149
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,639
[NAMI] But how can there be
fish up here in the clouds?

150
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,099
[ROBIN]
You said it best yourself.

151
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,934
Basically, it's an
ocean in the sky.

152
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:50,145
[CHOPPER]
So what's this big snake thing?

153
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,563
[LUFFY]
I dunno. A flatfish?

154
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,190
[CHOPPER] But it wasn't
flat till Sanji kicked it.

155
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:59,446
[screaming]

156
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,948
Oh, come on, Usopp.
What is it this time?

157
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:04,534
[USOPP]
There's something in my pants!

158
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,453
Usopp!

159
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:09,330
Sky island scary.
Sky island scary...

160
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,999
Not his day.

161
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:13,960
Sky island scary.
Sky island scary...

162
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:16,129
Hold on. Do you know
what this is?

163
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:17,464
I think it's one
of the "skyfish"

164
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,132
Noland described in his log.

165
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,217
It sounded pretty
fantastic at the time,

166
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,802
but now that I see it,

167
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,055
it looks like these creatures
have somehow actually evolved

168
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,681
to survive up here
in the clouds.

169
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,099
They evolved?

170
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:29,809
You mean they turned all flat
and balloony and stuff?

171
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,853
To make themselves even lighter.

172
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,147
The buoyancy up here must
be several times weaker

173
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,774
than in the oceans down below.

174
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:37,442
And they grew scales
like feathers.

175
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:40,737
And those weird
carnivore-like mouths.

176
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,030
I tried sautéing it.

177
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:43,073
Delicious!

178
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:45,408
Hey! We were still
examining that!

179
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:47,410
What were you guys thinking?

180
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,204
Hm, wait. This is good!

181
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,331
I've never tasted
anything like it!

182
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,166
[SANJI] Well, you know me,
I aim to please.

183
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,251
[LUFFY] Ooh! Let's eat
that big one, too!

184
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:57,337
[SANJI] Forget it. I don't
aim to please that much.

185
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,673
[CHOPPER]
So, where's this "sky island"?

186
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,550
Huh? What's that?

187
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,927
A ship.

188
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,929
Hey, guys! There's a--!

189
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:07,806
[gasps]

190
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,557
[CHOPPER screams]

191
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,518
[SANJI]
Say, what's wrong Chopper?

192
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,689
[SANJI] What's the deal?
You see somethin' out there?

193
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:18,608
Yeah! A ship! It was
there, but then it split!

194
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,110
[ZORO]
Say what?

195
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,362
And there's a bull with wings!
And he's running around...

196
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:24,572
[ZORO] You're talkin' crazy!
Calm down!

197
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:26,574
What got into him?

198
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,829
Check it out. He's right.

199
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:33,873
There's a guy runnin'
around out there.

200
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,709
Hey, stop! What do you want?

201
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:37,043
[WYPER]
To destroy you!

202
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,503
Oh, is that all?

203
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:39,337
He's mine.

204
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,214
Who is? What's goin' on?

205
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,098
[NAMI] Hey! Don't let this
guy walk all over you!

206
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,349
Get him!

207
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,105
[CHOPPER screams]

208
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:58,523
He's gonna blow us up!

209
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:02,152
Sky island scary.
Sky island scary.

210
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:03,862
[GAN FALL]
That's enough, villain!

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,419
Oh, great! Now who's this guy?

212
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:28,470
[GAN FALL] Miss, you may
call me the Sky Knight.

213
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,181
[PIERRE]
Pi-e!

214
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,661
He's gone.

215
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,205
What's going on here?

216
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,415
Who the heck was that guy?

217
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,834
And you. Could you be
any more worthless?

218
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:02,587
That was pathetic! You had him
outnumbered three to one!

219
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,923
[CHOPPER]
You saved us! Thanks a lot!

220
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,508
[GAN FALL]
I'm just doing my duty.

221
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,760
This one's on the house.

222
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:11,513
What gives? I feel so weak.

223
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:12,722
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

224
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:16,059
I... could barely move.

225
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:18,144
[ROBIN] It must be
because of the thin air.

226
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,229
[ZORO]
What?

227
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,398
Oh, yeah. I almost
forgot about that.

228
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,233
[GAN FALL]
You must be Blue Sea People.

229
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:25,485
[NAMI]
"Blue Sea People"? What's that?

230
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,653
And who are you?

231
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:28,446
[GAN FALL]
As I said, I am the Sky Knight.

232
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,657
And "Blue Sea People"
is what we call those

233
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,200
who live beneath the clouds.

234
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,535
The Sky Knight.

235
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,078
[GAN FALL] I'm assuming
that you've traveled here

236
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,663
from the blue sea.

237
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,831
[LUFFY]
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,290
[GAN FALL]
Then that explains it.

239
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,335
You have reached the White Sea,
7,000 meters in the air.

240
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,421
The White-White Sea, where
I assume you're heading,

241
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,965
is still further up,
about 10,000 meters.

242
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:50,343
Ordinary Blue Sea People can't
possibly endure it here.

243
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,554
Okay, I think I've
gotten used to it.

244
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:54,764
Yeah. I actually feel
much better already.

245
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:57,225
[GAN FALL] No, no, no.
That's just not possible.

246
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:58,810
[CHOPPER]
So, Mr. Knight,

247
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,438
why was that guy running around
in the clouds attacking people?

248
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,398
[GAN FALL]
Now, now. Not so fast.

249
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,025
No doubt you have
many questions,

250
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,402
but first we have matters
of business to discuss.

251
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:08,570
[NAMI]
Business?

252
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,864
You see, I am a
soldier-for-hire.

253
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,949
The White Seas can
be quite dangerous.

254
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,534
There are guerillas
lurking about,

255
00:13:14,617 --> 00:13:17,078
like the one you've just faced,
who would like nothing more

256
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,664
than to turn you into
food for the skyfish.

257
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:22,417
But if you purchase a
5,000,000 Extol One Whistle,

258
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,669
I'll protect you.

259
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:26,880
[LUFFY]
Huh? What're you talkin' about?

260
00:13:26,963 --> 00:13:30,091
[GAN FALL] Uh! Now, listen!
That price is quite reasonable!

261
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,677
I can't afford to lower it
a single extol more!

262
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,346
I have to earn a living, too.

263
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,306
[SANJI] Yeah, but what
the heck is an "extol"?

264
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,975
And what's this "whistle"
thing or whatever?

265
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,018
[GAN FALL]
You don't know?

266
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:41,561
I don't understand--
you came here

267
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,855
from the summit of
High-West, didn't you?

268
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:46,107
Surely you must have
passed an island or two.

269
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,817
I still don't know what
you're talkin' about.

270
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,402
Wait, let me get this straight.

271
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,571
You're saying there's another
way we could've gotten up here

272
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,907
where we would have passed
"an island or two"?

273
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,326
As in there's more
than one sky island?

274
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,787
[GAN FALL] What? Don't tell
me you traveled by way of--

275
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,538
[ROBIN] We rode up on
the Knock-Up Stream.

276
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,749
[GAN FALL]
My word. That monstrous current?

277
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:05,335
So there are still souls
in the world brave enough

278
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,337
to make the attempt.

279
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,882
[NAMI] I knew it! So we risked
are lives for nothing!

280
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:13,009
Are you happy?!
We could've all been killed!

281
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,594
If we'd just asked
around a little more,

282
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,554
we could've found a
safer way to get here!

283
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,848
Of all the reckless, stupid,
insane things to do!

284
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:20,767
What were you thinking?

285
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,727
[GAN FALL]
Did you lose any of your crew?

286
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:24,437
No. We all made it.

287
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,815
Then you can consider
yourselves fortunate.

288
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,149
Had you taken a different route,

289
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,110
one or two of you would've
survived the journey,

290
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:31,569
but the rest would've perished.

291
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,071
That's the gamble.

292
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:34,406
By way of the Knock-Up Stream,

293
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,616
either everyone dies
or everyone survives.

294
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,910
Those are the only two
possible outcomes.

295
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,537
Not many are willing to accept

296
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,372
that sort of
all-or-nothing risk.

297
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:44,207
Especially these days.

298
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,835
If nothing else, I see now
that you are navigators

299
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,546
of exceptional
bravery and skill.

300
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,923
Yeah, well, I hate
to take all the credit,

301
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,217
but see, when things got
scary and these guys

302
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,927
were all screamin' and
cryin' for their mommies,

303
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,929
I was the one who
stood up and said--

304
00:14:58,013 --> 00:14:59,305
Nothing at all!

305
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,306
Thought so.

306
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,017
[GAN FALL]
This is the One Whistle!

307
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,645
It is yours to use
as you see fit.

308
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,689
Should you find
yourselves in danger,

309
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,275
you have but to blow it and
I will come to your aid!

310
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,944
As I said, normally, I would
charge you five million extol,

311
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:16,364
but for today, please accept
this as my gift to you.

312
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,576
But wait! We still
don't know your name!

313
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:24,205
I am Gan Fall. And this
is my partner Pierre!

314
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,957
Pi-e!

315
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,753
[GAN FALL] Despite appearances,
Pierre is no ordinary bird.

316
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,883
[GAN FALL] Long ago,
he ate of a Horse-Horse Fruit

317
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,968
and gained its powers.

318
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,679
What? What powers?

319
00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:41,222
[GAN FALL]
He is able to transform

320
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:43,141
into a horse with wings!

321
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:44,517
Namely--

322
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,686
Oh! Wow! A Pegasus!

323
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,355
[GAN FALL]
Yes! A Pegasus!

324
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:51,941
[PIERRE]
Pi-e!

325
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:54,819
[ALL]
Wow, that's... something.

326
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:59,949
[GAN FALL] May luck be
with you, brave warriors!

327
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,577
[SANJI] Am I the only one
who finds that bizarre?

328
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,787
[NAMI]
I don't get it.

329
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,705
Was there even a reason
for it to transform?

330
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,624
[OTHERS]
Good question.

331
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:10,960
[ROBIN] In the end, he really
didn't tell us anything, did he?

332
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,921
[USOPP]
No. Nothing, actually.

333
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,256
[SANJI] Well, back to
square one, I guess.

334
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,133
Yeah. Where are we supposed
to go from here?

335
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:18,301
[LUFFY]
I know!

336
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,929
Let's call the old man
back and ask him!

337
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:22,263
Don't even think
about it, Luffy!

338
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,140
You don't blow that whistle
to ask for directions!

339
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,142
It's supposed to be for
emergencies only!

340
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,727
Yeah!

341
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,270
What if that guerilla guy who
attacked us comes back again?

342
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,439
You wanna get blown up?

343
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,067
I'll tell you what. For now,
let's just keep moving.

344
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,903
[CHOPPER]
Hey, look over there, you guys!

345
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:37,862
What is that?

346
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,406
Some kinda' cloud.

347
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,200
It looks more like a waterfall.

348
00:16:42,283 --> 00:16:45,745
[ZORO] Okay, that settles
it. We go that way.

349
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,054
Hey! Hold up!
Stop the boat here!

350
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,056
[ROBIN] Hmm. Looks like
the way's blocked.

351
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,725
[CHOPPER]
What do we do?

352
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:08,351
Those big clouds look
like they're floating

353
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,520
on top of the ocean,
sorta like icebergs.

354
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:11,938
So, what? They're "cloud-bergs"?

355
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:14,190
Well, there's obviously
something different about them.

356
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,526
Maybe I can grab a piece.

357
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,572
Gum-Gum... Pistol!

358
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,074
It bounced off!

359
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,660
[laughs]

360
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,203
Ah!

361
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,539
[LUFFY]
Hey, look! I'm not sinking!

362
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:33,126
It's all fluffy and bouncy!
It's great! Ha!

363
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,338
You guys outta try this!
Come on! It's fun!

364
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:37,714
[LUFFY laughing]

365
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:39,049
How does this work?

366
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:39,924
It's a mystery.

367
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:42,052
[USOPP]
Wa-hoo! Here I come!

368
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,636
Me, too! Me, too!

369
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,181
[sighs]

370
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:50,185
So soft. It's like a gigantic
marshmallow pillow.

371
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,645
Maybe I'll just
take a little nap.

372
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:59,069
[ALL laughing]

373
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:02,280
Hm. Well, we obviously can't
sail through these clouds,

374
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,033
so we'll have to find a way to
get around them somehow.

375
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,951
Hey, you guys see
if you can spot a route

376
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,204
the ship can take!

377
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,288
Yeah! Right!

378
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,207
[USOPP]
Luffy! Come check this out!

379
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,375
What?

380
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,626
[NAMI] Where do you
think you're going?!

381
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,670
Get back here!
Quit playing around!

382
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,881
[LUFFY laughing]

383
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:21,424
What in the world is that?

384
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,384
[NAMI]
A gate?

385
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,677
Yeah! A big one.

386
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,720
It's up ahead, underneath
that waterfall thingy.

387
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,181
[CHOPPER laughing]

388
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,683
[SANJI]
So there's a man-made structure

389
00:18:29,766 --> 00:18:31,226
in the middle of the clouds?

390
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,186
[ROBIN] At this point, I'm not
sure anything we'd find up here

391
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,063
would surprise me.

392
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,856
[LUFFY]
Well, we'll see it soon enough!

393
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,066
[CHOPPER]
Take a left next.

394
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:39,109
[USOPP]
No, go right!

395
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:40,193
[CHOPPER]
But it's to our left!

396
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:41,820
[USOPP]
It's on the right!

397
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,947
[LUFFY]
I'll call the old knight guy!

398
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,743
Hey. We're here.

399
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,623
[ALL gasp]

400
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,210
[SANJI]
Yep. That's a gate, all right.

401
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:58,712
[NAMI]
And look.

402
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:01,381
That weird cloud we saw really
is some kind of waterfall.

403
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:03,675
It's coming down on top
of those "cloud-bergs."

404
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,427
[USOPP] Hold on, am I
reading this right?

405
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,179
"Heaven's Gate"?
What's that all about?

406
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:10,807
Sounds like a place
you go when you die.

407
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,392
Yeah? Well now that
you mention it,

408
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,644
maybe we are dead.
You ever think about that, huh?

409
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,980
Oh. You know, that would
actually go a long way

410
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:18,606
towards explaining
this weird place.

411
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,899
But I don't wanna be dead!

412
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,359
[LUFFY laughs]

413
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,403
Who cares? We're here, right?

414
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,488
Wherever this gate
goes, I'm goin'.

415
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:27,323
[NAMI]
Will you get serious?!

416
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,575
[ZORO]
Ow! What was that for?

417
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:30,660
[NAMI] If you're making
a joke, it's not funny!

418
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,288
[CHOPPER]
So, why'd you hit me, too?

419
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:36,416
Wait! Over there!
There's somebody's coming out!

420
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,468
Look! She's got--
She's got wings!

421
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:50,972
Wow. That's what sky people
look like? She's so wrinkly.

422
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,061
[NAMI]
Um, hello.

423
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:59,147
[AMAZON] I am Amazon,
the Heaven's Gate inspector.

424
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,357
State your business.

425
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,443
Sightseeing?
Warmongering? Other?

426
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,196
[NAMI] I-I guess it's
kinda like sightseeing.

427
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,365
[LUFFY] We wanna go
to the sky islands!

428
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,034
They're past this gate, right?

429
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,119
[ZORO]
Can we say "all of the above"?

430
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,122
It makes little difference.

431
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:17,791
But if you wish to proceed,

432
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,501
you must first pay
the entrance fee

433
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,878
of one billion extol per person.

434
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,004
That is the law.

435
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,798
What?! One billion?!

436
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,300
They're really big on these
extol things around here.

437
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:28,927
I can't even count that high.

438
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,929
I wonder how much that
would be in Berries.

439
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,765
It's got to be a lot.
I mean, a billion anything.

440
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:35,684
It sounds expensive.

441
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,646
A billion per person,
which makes seven blllion total.

442
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,147
Something's fishy here.

443
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,483
Seven billion just to go
through a stupid gate?

444
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:46,069
I think this old bag's
trying to scam us--

445
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,530
Listen, about the money.

446
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,700
What if, you know,
we don't have it?

447
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,784
You may still pass.

448
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,160
What, seriously?

449
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:55,328
[AMAZON]
The choice is yours.

450
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,789
I certainly won't
try to stop you.

451
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,290
[NAMI, USOPP]
Uh?

452
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:01,334
My job description
does not require me

453
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,836
to actually guard the gate.

454
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,213
I'm merely here to
ask your intentions.

455
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,381
[SANJI]
Uh...

456
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:07,507
[LUFFY]
So that settles it!

457
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,050
We wanna go to the sky islands!

458
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,261
[USOPP] But we don't have the
money, so we can't pay you!

459
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:13,763
[AMAZON] Very well.
The seven of you, then?

460
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,599
Yeah.

461
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:19,144
Except, we still need you to
tell us how to get there.

462
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,190
[NAMI, CHOPPER, USOPP screaming]

463
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,359
[LUFFY]
What the heck is that?

464
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,738
The White Sea's
famous Express Lobster.

465
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,615
[LUFFY, USOPP scream]

466
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,159
[USOPP]
We're moving!

467
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:36,161
[CHOPPER]
It's a giant lobster!

468
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,537
[ZORO]
It's taking us up the waterfall!

469
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,622
[NAMI]
Everybody hang on tight!

470
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:40,957
[SANJI]
It's so fast!

471
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:47,047
[USOPP screaming]

472
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:52,385
[screaming]

473
00:21:53,553 --> 00:21:56,222
[AMAZON] This is Heaven's
Gate inspector Amazon!

474
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,807
Hear me now!

475
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,852
To the almighty God above,
and his holy priests,

476
00:22:00,935 --> 00:22:02,812
I bear tidings!

477
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:07,150
Seven illegal entrants have
passed into God's Land, Skypiea!

478
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:11,196
Bestow upon them
Heaven's Judgment!

479
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:19,996
[AMAZON] Bestow upon
them Heaven's Judgment.

480
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:30,757
<i>Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

481
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,386
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear-blue sky...</i>

482
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:38,098
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

483
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:45,230
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

484
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,746
<i>When I am alone</i>

485
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,585
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

486
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:10,088
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

487
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:14,884
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

488
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:19,889
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

489
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,350
<i>until I recalled...</i>

490
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:27,063
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

491
00:23:27,147 --> 00:23:30,817
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

492
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,656
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...</i>

493
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,623
[USOPP] Okay, that does it--
I've had enough of this place!

494
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:48,752
I want out! There's only so
much my nerves can take!

495
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,836
[SANJI]
Oh, be a man.

496
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,005
[LUFFY]
Ooh, look! Another sky person!

497
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,424
[USOPP] Yeah, so is she all
wrinkly like the last one?

498
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:57,344
[SANJI] If she is, there're the
most beautiful wrinkles ever!

499
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:59,304
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

500
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:03,391
"Godland, Skypiea!
Angels on a Beach of Clouds!"

501
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,977
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
