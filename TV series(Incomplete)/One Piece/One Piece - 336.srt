1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,283
[NARRATOR] With a mighty "C"
emblazoned on his cape.

38
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,118
Who is this tiny hero

39
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,287
who protects the
peace of this world?

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,490
Why, Chopperman, of course!

41
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:48,193
[CHOPPER]
Chopperman to the Rescue!

42
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,895
Protect the TV Station
by the Shore!

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,303
[USOPP] What's so great
about that pipsqueak, anyway?

44
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,805
If he was a real hero,
he would see how brilliant I am

45
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:02,974
and let me take over
the World Government!

46
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:06,010
[NARRATOR]
Evil Incarnate, Dr. Usodaba.

47
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,946
This mad scientist
is always plotting

48
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,047
to rule the world

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,249
with an iron fist,
a wicked mustache

50
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,985
and the power of his
underground organization.

51
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:16,120
Though if my minions
would do their jobs properly,

52
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,823
maybe this wouldn't
be a problem!

53
00:03:18,856 --> 00:03:21,759
Yes, I'm talking about you,
you freeloaders!

54
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:22,694
Huh?

55
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:25,630
[NARRATOR]
The naughty monster, Sanjiropus!

56
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,700
He insists that
he isn't naughty,

57
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,136
but is always thinking
about naughty stuff!

58
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,972
I'm always
a perfect gentleman.

59
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,073
[ZORO] Yeah, right.

60
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,245
[NARRATOR] Mysterious
Rice Ball Monster, Zorokiller.

61
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,512
[NARRATOR] He loves rice balls!

62
00:03:41,546 --> 00:03:45,083
If you don't have rice balls for
him, he'll never forgive you!

63
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:47,719
That's right, I won't!

64
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:49,053
Would you good-for-nothings
stop sitting there

65
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:50,888
and start taking over
the world for me?

66
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:51,723
More tea.

67
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,124
Sure! Right away!

68
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:56,261
Hey, you can't boss your
boss around like that!

69
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,096
Now pour me a cup.

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,704
[USOPP] I may be evil, but I
need love just like anyone else.

71
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,007
How can I find minions
that are evil in a good way

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,075
instead of evil in a mean way?

73
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,811
[SHOUPAN] Be a star in
our new singing competition!

74
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:16,381
Show the whole world
your hidden talent on live TV

75
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,716
to win fame and fortune!

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,550
[USOPP] That's it!

77
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,619
Soon the whole
world will love me!

78
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,323
[laughing evilly]

79
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:27,358
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
at Chopperman's secret base,

80
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,694
somewhere secret
that we can't tell you...

81
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:33,097
You wanna do this
the hard way?

82
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,600
Huh? Spit it out already!

83
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,305
[NARRATOR] Chopperman's
lovely assistant, Namifia.

84
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:42,373
She's in charge of
assigning missions to our hero

85
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,777
to make sure that he
doesn't watch TV all day.

86
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,046
If you don't ring,
I'll wring your neck!

87
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,781
I mean, please,
Mr. Transponder Snail!

88
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm begging you!

89
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:54,152
We won't be able to
pay bills this month!

90
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,320
Who am I kidding?

91
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:58,156
I guess our only option is
to cut the snack allowance.

92
00:04:58,189 --> 00:04:59,791
[CHOPPER laughing]

93
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,193
A polar bear, huh?

94
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:02,960
Panda.

95
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:07,098
[CHOPPER laughing]

96
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,401
Hey, Namifia.

97
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,969
I'm out of potato chips.

98
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:14,238
Would you mind getting
another bag for me, please?

99
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,777
[NARRATOR]
Champion of Justice, Chopperman.

100
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,114
He's a hero that protects
the peace of the world.

101
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:24,415
What did you expect?

102
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,988
That really hurt!
Why are you so mean to me?

103
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:32,824
This is no time to sit idly by,

104
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,093
watching TV and
eating potato chips!

105
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,160
It's a tragedy!

106
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,128
The world is at peace

107
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,063
and all the bad guys
are taking a day off!

108
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,865
Yeah, but isn't
that a good thing?

109
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:42,066
Not for us, it isn't!

110
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,035
If people don't call in
asking us for help,

111
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:46,471
then how in the heck are we
supposed to make any money?

112
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,106
Who cares how much cash
we have in the bank?

113
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,975
You can't put a price tag
on world peace!

114
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:52,777
But you can put a
price on potato chips,

115
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,911
which we can no longer afford.

116
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,079
No, I'm sorry!

117
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,114
Hm?

118
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:58,916
Next, we'll cover
local news stories.

119
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,051
Maybe we'll be lucky

120
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,986
and something really terrible
is going on right now.

121
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,122
Like a giant robot
going on a rampage,

122
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,758
or an army of space lizards
kidnapping the mayor.

123
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,226
[CHOPPER]
Hey! Gimme back the remote!

124
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,227
Not a chance.

125
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,195
[CHOPPER] But I wanna
watch my comedy shows!

126
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:11,963
--Pretty pretty please?
--No way.

127
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,997
[SHOUPAN] Yeek!

128
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,267
[USOPP laughing evilly]

129
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,902
Good evening ladies and gents!

130
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:19,437
There has been a
small change of program.

131
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,772
--It's Usodaba!
--It's Usodaba!

132
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,039
In case you haven't noticed,

133
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:25,476
my Evil Organization has taken
over your beloved TV station!

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,044
Sweet! Just what we needed!

135
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:28,813
[CHOPPER]
Did he get his own TV show?

136
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,747
As you might suspect,

137
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,449
this is part of one
of my genius schemes

138
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:33,084
to take over
the World Government!

139
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:34,152
Don't change the channel,

140
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,788
because I'm going to
give you every gory detail!

141
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:40,224
In order for the Usodaba
Gang to tighten its iron grip,

142
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,226
we are now taking
applications for new employees,

143
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,263
open to everyone free of charge,
for a limited time!

144
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,264
--Huh?
--Huh?

145
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:48,166
[USOPP] No pesky job interview!

146
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,834
No background check, either!

147
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,069
As an added bonus,
our first applicant will receive

148
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,538
a very special,
one of kind treasure

149
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,473
from my own personal collection!

150
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:57,542
[USOPP] It's fast! It's strong!

151
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,144
But it's still just a model,
so no, you can't ride it.

152
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,412
It's the awesome, super-rare,

153
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:04,916
Air Force C-Max Limited Edition
Pre-Painted Red Color Version!

154
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,150
I do hate to see it go,

155
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,519
seeing as I had to wait in line
a week in the freezing cold,

156
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,988
sleeping on the street
and peeing in a bucket,

157
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,191
but for my minions,
no cost is too great!

158
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,226
The Air Force
C-Max Limited Edition?

159
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,494
No way!

160
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,396
The phone lines
will be opening shortly,

161
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,499
so I look forward to seeing
you all in the Usodaba Gang!

162
00:07:21,532 --> 00:07:23,167
This looks like serious trouble!

163
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,569
Chopperman, are you ready to go?

164
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:25,436
Yeah!

165
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,038
[NAMI]
You know what your mission is?

166
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,039
Of course I do!

167
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,808
I have to hurry so I can
get the Air Force C-Max!

168
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,877
You've gotta be kidding me!

169
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,078
[CHOPPER] Sorry, can't hear you!

170
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,414
Joining the bad guys!

171
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,250
I think I need to
find a new line of work.

172
00:07:39,283 --> 00:07:40,351
Wait a sec!

173
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:43,287
The Giant Luffy Bomber!

174
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,857
All I have to do is use that!

175
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,859
It's gone!

176
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,093
Oh, I forgot.

177
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,696
I sold it to get
all these fabulous rings.

178
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,902
[USOPP laughing evilly]

179
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,403
[USOPP]
What do you think, Robiflowern?

180
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,305
I bet I made all the
ladies weak in the knees

181
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,074
in my first big TV appearance.

182
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,476
I wouldn't know.
I wasn't paying attention.

183
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,380
[NARRATOR]
Flower Monster, Robiflowern.

184
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,282
[NARRATOR] An evil
creature whose wickedness

185
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:14,185
can only be stopped by
Chopperman's Secret Technique.

186
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,987
The Cute Spark!

187
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,221
So what do you think, guys?

188
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:20,091
Is your boss
pretty awesome or what?

189
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,192
[SANJI] Huh?

190
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,160
When I get new minions,
you guys are totally fired!

191
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:24,028
More tea.

192
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,329
Sure! Right away!

193
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:28,499
Hey, you can't boss
your boss around like that!

194
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,301
Now pour me a cup.

195
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:35,072
[USOPP] Fine. Be jerks.

196
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:38,142
Soon enough I'll have
a whole army of admirers.

197
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:40,344
[MINIONS] We love you, Usodaba!

198
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,980
You're a genius, Usodaba!

199
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:45,616
Here's your tea, Usodaba!

200
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,553
[ROBIN] I admit, taking over
a TV station was a good idea,

201
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:50,421
even if you came up with it.

202
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,623
Could you tone down
the contempt a little bit?

203
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,893
Everyone and their dog knows
my plans are always perfect!

204
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:57,495
Soon, all the
people tuning in at home

205
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,264
will see how awesome and
powerful the Usodaba Gang is!

206
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,432
Then a whole sea
of new applicants

207
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:02,667
will come clamoring
over each other

208
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,368
for a chance to kiss my feet.

209
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:06,037
With my army of adoring fans,

210
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,372
taking over the World
Government will be easy!

211
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:11,042
And I can finally show
those ingrates the door.

212
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,243
Now that you have the station,

213
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,178
what kind of show
are you going to make?

214
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm glad you asked, my dear.

215
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,319
[USOPP] I'll steal their hearts

216
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,155
with the sound
of my sweet singing voice!

217
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:31,362
[SANJI] Not so fast!
Better leave this to me!

218
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:32,597
I have the face for TV,

219
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,232
and I'm sure all the lovely
ladies sitting at home watching

220
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,567
would agree with me.

221
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,036
Don't you think so,
too, Robiflowern?

222
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,904
[ROBIN] Sure.

223
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:40,805
I just hope you
won't mind sharing me

224
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:44,141
with my inevitable
legion of fangirls.

225
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:45,610
[ROBIN] I don't know about him.

226
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:47,478
[USOPP] Let him do
what he wants, Robiflowern.

227
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,647
Arguing with him
is a waste of time.

228
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,015
I need you on the phones,

229
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,249
'cause when those calls
start pouring in,

230
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:55,319
you're going to need all six
of those arms to answer them!

231
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,420
[ROBIN] Understood.

232
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,521
[chuckling]

233
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,724
[USOPP] The call center
will be plunged into chaos!

234
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:02,293
No amount of annoying
hold music or busy signals

235
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,729
will deter the masses
from worshipping me!

236
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:06,263
[laughing maniacally]

237
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:10,101
[SANJI]
Sanjiropus' 30 Hour Cooking!

238
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,135
[laughing maniacally]

239
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:13,004
Hello!

240
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,739
I'm the charming kitchen
creature of your dreams,

241
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,240
Sanjiropus!

242
00:10:16,273 --> 00:10:18,009
[SANJI] Today,
I'll show you a simple recipe

243
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,679
that transforms leftovers
from disgusting to delectable!

244
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,648
No matter what kind of
crap you have in your fridge,

245
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,583
I can turn it
into a masterpiece!

246
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,618
All it takes
is three quick seconds.

247
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,320
And voila!

248
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:31,255
Can we get that
in slo-mo, please?

249
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,758
All right,
that should do it for today!

250
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,394
For the next
29 hours and 59 minutes,

251
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,097
I'll be staring at you ladies
lovingly from inside the TV.

252
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,384
Are you stupid?

253
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,086
The food's gonna get cold
if you leave it out like that!

254
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,221
That's your complaint?

255
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,789
[USOPP] You leave me no choice.

256
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:15,725
I'll have to serenade
my adoring public--

257
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,360
[ZORO]
Not a chance!

258
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,461
Get outta here.

259
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:20,930
I'll put on a show the
audience won't soon forget!

260
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,198
You just sit there and watch.

261
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:23,232
[sobbing]

262
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:29,572
[PORCHE] Oh no!

263
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,041
Let's have some fun, missy!

264
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,275
Someone help me!

265
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,777
There's no use crying now!

266
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,145
[ZORO] Don't move!

267
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,085
And who the heck are you?

268
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,254
What does it matter?
Just cut him to shreds!

269
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,060
[YOSAKU, JOHNNY] He's a lot
stronger than he looks!

270
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:53,696
Ow...

271
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:00,736
Spare me, it isn't my fault!
I wasn't raised right!

272
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,737
Hey, pal.

273
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,173
You don't happen to have
any rice balls, do you?

274
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:07,643
What?

275
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,247
Make sure you
have some from now on.

276
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,115
Um, thank you?

277
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,990
That didn't make
a lick of sense!

278
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,992
If they keep crapping up
the airways with this trash,

279
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,393
my plan is going to backfire!

280
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:25,127
[CHOPPER] 'Scuse me!

281
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,363
I'm here to join
the evil empire!

282
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,898
Finally, someone showed up!

283
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,698
Hey, boss!

284
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:30,766
Are you mocking me?

285
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,368
No, I really
wanna join your gang!

286
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,602
Or I really want
the toy, at least.

287
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:36,739
You still have the Air Force
C Max Limited Edition, right?

288
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:38,207
What do you take me for?

289
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,209
If you think I'm going to
give my most prized possession

290
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,845
to my worst enemy,
you're out of your mind!

291
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,280
Wait a moment.

292
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:46,048
But I really really want it!

293
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:47,983
Would you like me
to escort him out?

294
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,418
No. Not yet.

295
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:50,886
Hey, runt.

296
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,188
You said you wanted this?

297
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,689
Yeah, a whole bunch!

298
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,224
Then here, I'll give it to you.

299
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:55,958
You mean it?

300
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,993
--Oh, yay!
--But in exchange,

301
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,830
you have to lose to me in a
televised pro wrestling match

302
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,998
in front of a
live studio audience!

303
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,467
It's that, or no deal!

304
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,202
I have to lose?

305
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,003
But the hero never loses.

306
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,306
You just have to
pretend that I beat you.

307
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:11,740
A small price to pay for the

308
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:14,777
Air Force C Max
Limited Edition, I think.

309
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,149
I'm good at pretending!

310
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:21,116
I'll do it!

311
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,318
Get him ready for the show!

312
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,486
He's going to be a star!

313
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,153
[UNDERLING 51] Right!

314
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:27,256
I'm gonna be on TV! Hooray!

315
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,091
Are you sure about this, sir?

316
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,459
[chuckling]

317
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,294
What better way to
show the world how awesome I am

318
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,129
than to beat Chopperman
in a wrestling match!

319
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,232
Pro wrestling is known
for its integrity and realism,

320
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,900
so there's no way
that anyone would suspect

321
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,134
that we were faking it!

322
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:41,136
Right, of course.

323
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,940
Just watch, the main event
is finally about to start!

324
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:00,689
[SHOUPAN] Ladies and gentlemen,

325
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:03,058
welcome to the
match of the millennium!

326
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,095
Tonight's main event
is Usodaba vs Chopperman!

327
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:09,131
We're broadcasting live from
atop this fantastic globe arena

328
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:11,901
where the audience
is wild with anticipation!

329
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,403
I'm Shoupan, your
ringside announcer for tonight.

330
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,372
And sitting next to me
providing commentary

331
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:18,507
is the impressive
Minoru "The Wind"!

332
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,075
Good to be here.

333
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,278
[SHOUPAN] It seems
our wrestling mad scientist

334
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,246
is putting on a show
before the fight.

335
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,114
Ladies and gentlemen,

336
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:27,216
before I smash
Chopperman's face in,

337
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,152
let me serenade you with
a song I wrote just for tonight!

338
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,420
Cue the music!

339
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,324
[SHOUPAN] Well, never mind that,
because here comes Chopperman!

340
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,459
Yay! Are you watching, Namifia?

341
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:40,496
[cheering]

342
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,831
All this cheering
doesn't make me happy,

343
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:44,833
you big buncha jerks!

344
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:49,905
The crowd has spoken,
cuteness beats evil any day!

345
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:53,242
[USOPP] This is the last time
you ever make a fool of me!

346
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,945
You'll be sorry when
I'm popular, just you wait!

347
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,979
[bell rings]

348
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,416
Usodaba Neck Breaker!

349
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,383
Ow, that hurts!

350
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,452
Hey, I thought this
was just for pretend!

351
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,321
You better hold up
your end of the deal!

352
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,856
You still want your
little prize, don't you?

353
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,858
My prize?

354
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,461
The Air Force C Max
Limited Edition!

355
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,500
Wow, Usodaba sure has spirit,
but Chopperman not so much.

356
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,501
Is something wrong?

357
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:22,004
Maybe Chopperman got a
bad grade on a math quiz

358
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,172
and he's feeling down.

359
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,974
I know that always
used to bum me out.

360
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,276
Well, whatever the cause,
it's a one-sided match.

361
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,143
Yahh!

362
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,345
Owowowowow!

363
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,489
I never knew
Usodaba had it in him!

364
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,425
He looks flabby, but he sure
does have some enthusiasm!

365
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:44,493
He's not bad.

366
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,629
I never knew Chopperman
was such a little weenie.

367
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:47,930
He is pretty lame.

368
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:49,531
I thought Usodaba
was a scientist,

369
00:15:49,565 --> 00:15:51,266
but he's got some
pretty smooth moves!

370
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,004
Go Usodaba! Go Usodaba!

371
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,006
--Go Usodaba!
--Go Usodaba!

372
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,441
[CROWD]
Go Usodaba! Go Usodaba!

373
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,343
And it seems the crowd
is turning around fast!

374
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,979
Even cuteness can only carry
you so far if you're weak!

375
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,215
[SANJI] Hello,
is this the wrestling arena?

376
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:07,349
Yes, Sanjiropus,

377
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,917
do you have any
news for our viewers?

378
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,085
Over here at the call center,

379
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,153
the phones are
ringing off the hook

380
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:14,189
with people just dying
to join the Usodaba Gang.

381
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,227
[USOPP] Finally!
Finally they see my greatness!

382
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,307
Haven't we done
this long enough?

383
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,309
I wanna get my
toy plane and go home!

384
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,277
[USOPP] Don't be a baby,
we're almost done!

385
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:29,680
I'll do my finishing move now!

386
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,516
[USOPP] I'm gonna
finish you for real, though!

387
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:35,252
[SHOUPAN] Uh-oh! Usodaba
has climbed to the top rope!

388
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,588
Chopperman's in
big trouble this time!

389
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,291
Could this be the birth
of a new dark hero?

390
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:43,060
[ROBIN] Farewell, Chopperman.

391
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,303
But before that,
how about a little song?

392
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:59,576
Gah! My precious Air Force
C Max Limited Edition!

393
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,512
Don't die on me!

394
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:03,781
Whew! It looks like
I can still fix it.

395
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,382
Thank goodness!

396
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,217
[CHOPPER] Thank goodness!

397
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:10,454
Gimme!

398
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,289
Yeah, right.

399
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,557
But you promised!

400
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,459
Oh, did I?

401
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,493
Well, that's too bad,

402
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,662
because I had no intention
of giving it to you.

403
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:19,663
I lied.

404
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:22,099
Bu--But that's so mean!

405
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,767
[laughing evilly]

406
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,103
I never wanted you
as a part of my evil empire

407
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,071
in the first place!

408
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,872
I just wanted to be
more popular than you!

409
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,841
But I tried so hard!

410
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:31,775
Forget the song!

411
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,378
Let's get that Usodaba
cheer going again!

412
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,246
[CHOPPER] Not so fast!

413
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,881
This fight isn't over yet!

414
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:40,284
Scoff! Don't make me laugh!

415
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,553
[CHOPPER] Special Attack...

416
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,254
...Try my Cute Spark!

417
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:45,756
Aww! How cute!

418
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,724
They don't call it
"Cute Spark" for nothing!

419
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:48,892
[CHOPPER]
Cute cute cute!

420
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:50,027
[NARRATOR] Let me explain.

421
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,729
Chopperman's "Cute Spark"
renders any enemy helpless

422
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:54,498
by melting their hearts.

423
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,133
Who can say no to those eyes?

424
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,401
Aww!

425
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,870
Vroom vroom! Vroom vroom!

426
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,005
What the whaaa?

427
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,607
How can anything
be that adorable?

428
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,775
It's just stupid!

429
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,311
Fight it, Usodaba, you're
walking right into his trap!

430
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:11,482
[CROWD] Chopperman!
Chopperman! Chopperman!

431
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:12,883
[USOPP] Stop it!

432
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,219
Aw, Chopperman is so adorable!

433
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:16,787
Suck on a lemon, Usodaba!

434
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,722
Chopperman's cuteness
has stolen their hearts

435
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:20,824
and Usodaba is old news!

436
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,893
Let's check in with
Sanjiropus at the call center

437
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:24,661
and see how things
are doing there.

438
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:25,896
Well, one fan wrote in,

439
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,298
"I hope Uso-dookie-da
has a heart attack".

440
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:29,500
That's not my name!

441
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,335
Hey, Long-Nose. Go get a job.

442
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:32,769
What is that supposed to mean?

443
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,371
This wrestling match
is finally starting

444
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,339
to get interesting!

445
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,274
Whose side are you on, anyway?

446
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:37,975
Curses.

447
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:40,310
[MINORU] Chopperman, tag me in!

448
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,378
Be like the wind!

449
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,079
[USOPP] Hey!

450
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,181
Who said this was a tag match?

451
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:48,785
How dare you hurt
Chopperman's feelings,

452
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:50,053
you heartless monster!

453
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,524
[SHOUPAN] Minoru rushes in like
the wind and blows Usodaba away!

454
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:55,225
[cheering]

455
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,427
It's time for
my secret weapon.

456
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,863
[distant rumbling]

457
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:01,331
Wha--What's that?

458
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,267
Hey! Look outside!

459
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,504
Cyber!

460
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:10,541
[NARRATOR]
The Giant Robot Frangasharn!

461
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,910
[NARRATOR]
Dr. Usodaba's latest creation!

462
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,613
He's so new, I can't even
tell you anything about him!

463
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,848
Go forth, Frangasharn!

464
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,817
Destroy whatever you like!
I'm not picky!

465
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:21,518
Yeah!

466
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:22,853
[screaming]

467
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:25,422
[CHOPPER] Leave it to me!

468
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,356
Why fight for myself

469
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,392
when I have giant
robots to fight for me?

470
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,927
[CHOPPER yelling]

471
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,228
[LUFFY] Careful.

472
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,763
No, it can't be!

473
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,437
[NARRATOR]
The giant robot, Luffybomber!

474
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,739
It's big! It talks!

475
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,943
And for better or worse,
it always does what it wants!

476
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,578
Sorry I'm late!

477
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:49,313
You better be grateful for this.

478
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:51,481
I had to sell
all of my rings back.

479
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:53,884
But as soon as this is over,
I'm buying them back!

480
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:54,818
Thanks, Namifia!

481
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:56,920
They're stealing
my spotlight, Frangasharn!

482
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:58,255
Go shut them up!

483
00:19:58,288 --> 00:20:00,357
[FRANKY]
Don't gotta ask me twice!

484
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,802
Banzai!

485
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:14,938
'Kay. Are you ready?

486
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,440
Yeah!

487
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,709
Crush those morons, Frangasharn!

488
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,545
No, stop it!
That's cheating!

489
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:23,747
What are you trying to do?

490
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,716
--He picked up the globe!
--He picked up the globe!

491
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:26,683
[USOPP] Are you crazy?

492
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,653
There's a ton of
innocent bystanders in here!

493
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,855
Oh. Wow, they
really got away fast!

494
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,991
[LUFFY] All right, here we go!

495
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:43,734
[FRANKY] Not bad.

496
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,740
[USOPP] I'm going to die!

497
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:53,944
[USOPP] Huh? Gahh!
Don't touch me! Let me go!

498
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:55,512
I mean don't let me go--
I mean...

499
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,446
[CHOPPER] You big meanie!

500
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,547
How dare you lie to me!

501
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:00,584
I'm gonna bust your face
with some Chopper Violence!

502
00:21:00,617 --> 00:21:03,420
[USOPP screaming]

503
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,858
--All in a day's work!
--All in a day's work!

[CROWD cheering]

505
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:12,896
Any words for your fans?

506
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:15,365
This cheering doesn't
make me happy at all,

507
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,867
you big buncha jerks!

508
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:19,770
[USOPP] This stinks.

509
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:22,506
All that work and now he's
more popular than before.

510
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,475
I'll get you next time!

511
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:31,315
This is a heavy price to pay,
even for peace, but anyway.

512
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,019
The public really does
seem to love him, huh?

513
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:37,721
I have an idea!

514
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,623
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

515
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:41,358
Yes, this is the
Chopperman Fan Club.

516
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,126
How can I help you?

517
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,462
[NAMI] Yes, we accept cash,
check, or fine jewelry

518
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,030
for the membership fee.

519
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,666
My gosh,
I'm such a genius!

520
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,501
How many of these
do I have to do?

521
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:52,769
My arm is tired!

522
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:54,838
Just that pile and
3 more in the closet.

523
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:57,074
If you finish
by the end of today,

524
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,775
I'll get you that
model plane you wanted.

525
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:00,510
Only a few thousand more to go!

526
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:02,879
Oh boy! I'll give it my best!

527
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,083
[NARRATOR]
So it's a happy ending at last.

528
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,884
For Namifia, at least.

529
00:22:07,918 --> 00:22:09,486
[NAMI]
Hello, Chopperman Fan club.

00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,987
[NARRATOR]
Keep fighting, Chopperman!

[CHOPPER]
Okay!

533
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:20,764
[LUFFY] Ooh!

534
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,400
It's the haunted sea
Granny Kokoro warned us about!

535
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,601
Bring on the ghosts!

536
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,571
I wanna see if they're as
scary looking as everyone says!

537
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:28,905
[MALE VOICE]
I bet they're incredibly scary!

538
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:31,441
[LUFFY] Awesome!
I can't wait!

539
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,577
Wait--Who are you?

540
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,112
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

541
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,914
The Mysterious Skeleton
Floating Through the Fog!

542
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:40,083
Venture into the Devil's Sea!

543
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,686
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
