1
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,541
Have they made the order
for the Buster Call yet?

2
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,510
We're still on standby.

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,712
Hurry!

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,648
Run to the evacuation ship!

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,787
So this is a Poneglyph, huh?

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,454
Yeah.

7
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,689
I heard even if we shoot it

8
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,358
with a cannon it won't leave
a single scratch on the thing.

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,126
I can't believe
these creepy things

10
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,728
are hidden all over the world.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,230
I don't like it.

12
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,089
Is that so?

13
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,323
Yes.

14
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,825
The evidence is clear.

15
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,494
This calls for nothing
short of the death penalty.

16
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,196
We're waiting for your order.

17
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,764
It's unfortunate.

18
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:46,400
But seeing as they've
broken the law so blatantly,

19
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,302
there's really no other option.

20
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,738
We must enforce our own rules.

21
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,340
We don't need your mock
sympathy, Elder Stars.

22
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,175
Save your breath.

23
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,112
You're talking to the leaders of
the world, you damned criminal!

24
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,346
Show some respect!

25
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,248
That must be Professor Clover.

26
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,585
Ohara's foremost authority
on archaeology.

27
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,553
I'm familiar with your work.

28
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,790
You've contributed much to
the world's cultural heritage.

29
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,793
It's sad to see a man of
your intellect go astray.

30
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,829
The history of this planet
belongs to all of mankind.

31
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,632
No matter what
that history may be,

32
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,635
you don't have the right to
forbid us from learning it.

33
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,270
No one does.

34
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,404
Professor.

35
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,674
If one can read the Poneglyphs,
then it's also possible

36
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,709
that they can revive
the ancient weapons

37
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,111
and place the
world in serious peril.

38
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,581
Even if you have
the best of intentions,

39
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:37,284
someone else could come along
and use your research for evil.

40
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,055
Be it good or bad, mankind
has the responsibility

41
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,058
to accept whatever
their history may hold.

42
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,527
As long as we don't succumb
to fear and ignorance,

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,163
we will be prepared for
anything that may come.

44
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,331
That's idealistic.

45
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,265
Is it?

46
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,233
Or are you just making
convenient excuses

47
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,701
to suit your needs?

48
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:59,073
In truth, there are two
mysteries left unsolved.

49
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:01,342
Of course we want to
read the Poneglyphs,

50
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,743
but the reason
why they were made

51
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:05,579
in the first place is
interesting as well.

52
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,481
Why was their
message so important,

53
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,717
that they had to inscribe
it on unbreakable stone

54
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,353
to pass on to
future generations?

55
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,356
Why were they hidden and
scattered across the world?

56
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,125
Why were they not
stored in a library?

57
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,295
The only logical conclusion is
that they feared their message

58
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,399
would be too easily destroyed
if they had written it on paper.

59
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,735
In other words,
they had an enemy.

60
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,737
Someone who was
afraid of the information

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,671
they wanted to pass on.

62
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,543
What are you trying to
imply, Professor Clover?

63
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,545
Since the Ancients
have disappeared,

64
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,482
we must assume that they
were defeated by this enemy,

65
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:45,385
and that whoever they were,
they survived through history.

66
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:51,358
It may be no coincidence, that
roughly 800 years in the past,

67
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,628
when the Blank Century came
to an end, the organization

68
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,365
we now call "The World
Government" was founded.

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,538
Therefore, if this unknown enemy
was indeed the World Government,

70
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,739
it might be in
their best interest

71
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,076
to "erase" this inconvenient
piece of information and let

72
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:13,113
the ancients disappear into a
fabricated "Blank Century".

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,583
By analyzing ancient manuscripts
and piecing together what we

74
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:19,153
could from the few Poneglyphs
we were able to find, we

75
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,656
discovered the existence of
a previously unknown country.

76
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,426
Although the details we
found were a bit scarce,

77
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,429
we believe it was a
grand and powerful kingdom.

78
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,665
And yet, despite their
strength, not a trace remains.

79
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,702
Or rather, those traces
were deliberately erased.

80
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,704
But they were prepared
for this possibility,

81
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,707
even as they faced
the threat of extinction.

82
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,675
And so they etched their
history in stone,

83
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,511
before their kingdom was
crushed under the might

84
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,548
of the allied nations now known
as the World Government.

85
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,550
Thus, the reason why
the Poneglyphs were made

86
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,619
becomes quite clear.

87
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,420
I see.

88
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,489
That's a bold hypothesis.

89
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,124
It's true that the
ancient weapons

90
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,193
would be a
threat to the world.

91
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,628
But more so than weapons,

92
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,163
what I believe the World
Government is afraid of

93
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,599
is the history surrounding
this lost kingdom.

94
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,469
Its existence and its ideologies
are so dangerous to you,

95
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,304
that you would kill
to keep them secret.

96
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,274
Although we still don't
know what makes you

97
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:16,210
fear this kingdom, we do
at least know its name.

98
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,811
Since we've gone so far already,

99
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,014
perhaps you'd like me
to share it with you now?

100
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,320
Kill him!

101
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,233
Professor!

102
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,372
You left us no choice.

103
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,275
You bastards!

104
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,510
How dare you!

105
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,445
Professor!

106
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,214
Ohara knows too much.

107
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,086
You may give
the order to attack.

108
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,587
Don't move an inch!

109
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,223
You mustn't let anyone escape.

110
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,734
Now then, with the golden
transponder snail entrusted

111
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,703
to me by Admiral Sengoku.

112
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,171
Professor!

113
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,673
Robin, you fool.

114
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,209
I told you to run. Hurry!

115
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,212
I invoke the Buster Call!

116
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,814
And, that's a wrap.

117
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,649
He pressed something!

118
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,818
What is that?

119
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,454
Get out of here! Go!

120
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,556
No! I don't want to be alone!

121
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,825
You have to stop
being so selfish.

122
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,060
This isn't the time!

123
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,063
Robin.

124
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,101
It's the Buster Call!

125
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,403
All battleships,
to your positions!

126
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,571
Prepare to open fire!

127
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,410
What? Hey, look!

128
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,580
The Tree of Knowledge
is on fire!

129
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,348
Damn it! What're you doing?

130
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,149
Are you insane?

131
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,085
Isn't it enough
to take our lives?

132
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,053
Hey, it's not my fault.

133
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,323
Must've caught fire when they
bombed your secret basement.

134
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,527
Stop this! Right now!

135
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,529
You can't replace
the documents in there!

136
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,463
Don't you realize that?

137
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,665
You! Don't move!

138
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,301
Whoa, we don't
need guns anymore.

139
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,738
Time for the government
agents to pull out.

140
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,440
Protect the books.

141
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,645
Let's put out the fire! Hurry!

142
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,323
Pass the water over here!

143
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,328
Carry as many books
outside as you can!

144
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,010
Bring that woman with you.

145
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,081
Get up.

146
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,216
There's still some info we
have to wring out of her.

147
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,718
She can't die yet.

148
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,587
Just make sure she
doesn't escape again.

149
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,593
Mommy!

150
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,200
Please Robin,
run while you still can!

151
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:30,471
You can't die here!
Not like this!

152
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,439
Funny nose!

153
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,511
Go! We're done for!

154
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,446
There's no point in staying!

155
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,118
Robin!

156
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,685
Robin, don't.

157
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,663
You're my mother, aren't you?

158
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,670
Make up your mind, Olvia!

159
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,672
Are you going to
board this ship or not?

160
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,707
Mommy!

161
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,775
I'm holding her back!

162
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,110
Just hurry and get on!

163
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,782
Mommy! Mommy! No! Mommy!

164
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,350
I'm sorry, Robin.

165
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,420
I can never call myself
your mother again.

166
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,323
After all these years,
after all I've done,

167
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,791
I don't have the right anymore.

168
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,635
Monster!

169
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,736
Monster!

170
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,539
She's so scary her mom ran away!

171
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,241
Hey, that's my daughter's dress!

172
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,175
You take it off!

173
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,409
I'm sorry, Aunt Roji!

174
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,278
I just wanted to try it on!

175
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,113
You sure eat a
lot for a freeloader.

176
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,524
Please, answer me.

177
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,095
Are you my mom?

178
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,369
Hm? Hold on.

179
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:11,171
That girl your daughter or what?

180
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,341
No.

181
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,575
Olvia.

182
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,646
I'm sorry, little girl.

183
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,016
You must be confusing
me with someone else.

184
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,452
Even if it comes to this,

185
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,522
I don't want you to be
the daughter of a criminal.

186
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,291
Olvia.

187
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:34,628
What a weird little brat.
Right, let's go!

188
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,745
It's me! It's Robin!

189
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:56,517
I've grown since the last time
so maybe you don't recognize me?

190
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,420
I've been waiting
for you all these years!

191
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,288
Are you sure?

192
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,423
You're really...

193
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,193
..not my mom?

194
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:12,600
Just once, someday,
I wanted to hold your hand,

195
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:16,237
and walk together like a family.

196
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,039
I studied hard to
become an archaeologist,

197
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,275
so I could go to sea with you!

198
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,077
I can read the Poneglyphs, too!

199
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,580
What did she say?

200
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,582
Robin! No!

201
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,485
So please, look at me!

202
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:36,190
Let me stay with you! Mom!

203
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,657
Robin!

204
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,061
I've waited so long.

205
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,163
We're finally together.

206
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,233
Don't leave me alone again!

207
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,224
Oh no! Now what's going on?

208
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,260
Now commencing the Buster Call.

209
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,828
All ships, fire at once.

210
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,831
Everything on the island
of Ohara is your target.

211
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,733
Let nothing remain.

212
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,101
The research conducted here

213
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,737
was far more extensive
than we anticipated.

214
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,340
Make sure that knowledge
is not passed on.

215
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,609
Do not allow it
to leave the island.

216
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,412
Annihilate the devils of Ohara!

217
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,513
Burn it to the ground!

218
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,181
In the name of justice!

219
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:39,553
Damn it!

220
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,455
What the hell?

221
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,057
Can't you wait 'til
we leave the island?

222
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,393
You're gonna kill us! Stop it!

223
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,263
The Tree of Knowledge
took a direct hit!

224
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:51,732
They're using their
highest power against us.

225
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,400
They stage their investigation,

226
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,402
but they were planning
this from the start.

227
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,237
Bastards.

228
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,204
Hey, chief.

229
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:59,473
That girl said she can
read the Poneglyphs.

230
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,475
Yeah, she did, didn't she?

231
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,110
I don't know if it's
true or not, though.

232
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,546
Probably safer to wipe
her out, just in case.

233
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,181
Don't let her leave the island.

234
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,283
Remember her face, all right?

235
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,484
We're retreating!

236
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,419
Then I'll grab Olvia.

237
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,454
Screw it!

238
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,590
The situation has
changed. Just run!

239
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,391
I'm not gonna
get blown up

240
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,393
trying to follow
some stupid order!

241
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,496
Our number one priority
is keeping me alive!

242
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,464
Retreat!

243
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,732
Everyone, back to the ship!

244
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,809
Put out the fire on that
side before it spreads!

245
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,712
Protect the library
at all costs!

246
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,601
I've been waiting a
long time to do this.

247
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,306
I'm glad.

248
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,478
Robin!

249
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,282
Mommy!

250
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,187
Robin, forgive me.

251
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,355
Please.

252
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,322
This is my fault

253
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,559
for not watching over
you with more care.

254
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,229
Is it really true that you
can read the Poneglyphs?

255
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,131
I had to learn.

256
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,500
Since, I wanted to be a scholar.

257
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,803
I never knew my little
girl was an archaelogist!

258
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,271
That's amazing!

259
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,608
You must've studied hard
while I was gone, huh?

260
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,410
These aren't things that just
anyone can do!

261
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,546
I'm so proud!

262
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,653
Fortunately, the
only ones who know

263
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:55,823
about this are the officials
who were here earlier.

264
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:58,392
We can't afford to
waste any more time!

265
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,694
Olvia! Take Robin and run!

266
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,364
If you can sneak her
onto the evacuation ship,

267
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:06,132
she might still be able
to leave the island!

268
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,070
Robin!

269
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:12,439
I've been looking
all over for you!

270
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,574
It's Saul!

271
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,509
So you met with
your mother after all.

272
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,510
Saul!

273
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,712
Why in the world are you here?

274
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,381
Guess it must be fate!

275
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,182
I just happened to wash up here

276
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,518
and your little girl was
the one who found me.

277
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,054
Anyhow, we ain't got
time to chat right now.

278
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,490
You gotta get off this island!

279
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,724
I'll be fine,

280
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,160
but I need you take care
of Robin for me, please.

281
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,396
Huh? But why? What about you?

282
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,265
Aren't you going
to come with me?

283
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,633
Olvia, are you?

284
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,168
I can't leave yet.

285
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,503
There's something left to do.

286
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,705
No, Mom! You can't leave me now!

287
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,740
I'll stay here with you!

288
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,809
I don't want to lose you again!

289
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,345
Robin, if you're
a scholar of Ohara,

290
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,181
you should know that history
is mankind's greatest treasure.

291
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,449
Now that it's been passed on,

292
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,285
it will illuminate
the path to your future.

293
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,355
However, you must
pass it on as well.

294
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,558
Or its light will disappear
with the next generation.

295
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,659
Save those books!

296
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,328
Someone take these!

297
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,130
We weren't trying to
uncover some dark secret.

298
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,064
We simply wanted to hear

299
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,801
the voices of the
past and protect them.

300
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,437
Unfortunately, our
research ends here.

301
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,106
But time marches on,
even if Ohara is destroyed.

302
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,277
And as surely as we
believe in the past,

303
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,413
we believe in the future
that you will inherit!

304
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,216
What does that mean?

305
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,588
Someday, you'll know.

306
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:39,793
Hurry. Take her and go, Saul.

307
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,296
Are you sure?

308
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,098
Yeah.

309
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:44,899
Stop it!

310
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:50,504
I wanna stay with you!
Mommy! No!

311
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,707
I was happy to hear
you call me that again.

312
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,579
Thank you. From now on,
for my sake as well.

313
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:01,348
You must live, Robin!

314
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,534
Vice Admiral Kuzan!

315
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,102
What now?

316
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,605
It looks like-- no,
wait, it's gotta be!

317
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:26,507
So are you gonna
tell me, or not?

318
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,309
Spit it out already, man!

319
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,410
It's the deserter.

320
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,744
Vice Admiral Saul!

321
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,414
Please, Saul, you
have to take me back!

322
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,381
I can't!

323
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,316
There's no way!

324
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,051
Don't cry, Robin!

325
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:39,820
Be proud! Your momma's
a wonderful woman!

326
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,755
Ohara's a wonderful place!

327
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,757
You gotta remember that!

328
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,160
It's up to you to
pass it on, okay?

329
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:50,130
Ohara was so brave they
fought against the whole world!

330
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,702
Are you crazy?

331
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:56,604
Capturing them is enough!

332
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,739
They ain't even pirates,
they're scholars!

333
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,775
Are you so weak you can't reel
'em in without blowing 'em up?

334
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,613
We shoot down these researcher
ships one after another,

335
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,549
but I still can't find any sense
in killin' these poor folks.

336
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,151
Vice Admiral Saul!

337
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,487
We found a survivor!

338
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,122
You're nothing but murderers!

339
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:17,791
You're scholars.

340
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,526
Why do you need ancient weapons?

341
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,828
You don't know a thing!

342
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:23,330
You don't even why
you're killing us!

343
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,732
That's a Vice Admiral
you're speaking to!

344
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,500
The weapons are just an excuse!

345
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,336
Why don't you try thinking about
what you're doing for once?

346
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:33,440
You're just afraid of a past
that you know nothing about!

347
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,577
This is a top-secret mission.

348
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,212
The Buster Call?

349
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,780
It's an all-out attack in

350
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,683
which Five Vice-Admirals
command ten battleships.

351
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,218
I want you to take part.

352
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,686
They're just scholars, right?

353
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:47,688
Why do we have to go so far?

354
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,357
Even the ones we've captured
before don't seem like

355
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,324
they care about weapons--

356
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,494
they just wanna learn
more about history!

357
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,362
If their research
is so dangerous,

358
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,698
why don't we help them
so nothing goes wrong?

359
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:01,101
Least you can do is give me some
proof that these folks are bad!

360
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,204
'Cause to me it seems like
we're the criminals here!

361
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,806
Are you questioning
the government?

362
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,375
Just follow your orders!

363
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,782
I got some questions for you.

364
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,317
You think we can talk?

365
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,485
This is an emergency!

366
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,654
Vice Admiral Saul has taken
the prisoner and deserted!

367
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,222
This won't do.

368
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,725
He knows too much
about our next operation.

369
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:25,425
After them.

370
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,661
Stop Saul and Olvia at any cost.

371
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,230
Open fire if necessary.

372
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,099
Troops'll be showing
up any minute now,

373
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:33,667
but I'll take care of 'em.

374
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,604
You know, you won't be able to
return to the Navy after this.

375
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:39,306
Fine by me. Now that
I got this doubt in my heart,

376
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,408
ain't no point
in staying anyway.

377
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,043
I know the law's the law,

378
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,779
but the way they're acting
this time is downright cruel.

379
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,315
So I'm following my
own sense of justice.

380
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,818
Now, you get to that island
and warn your friends.

381
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,419
I'm not going to thank you.

382
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,222
Well, good luck
to you, either way.

383
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,660
Fire!

384
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,131
They're not targeting the
island, they're targeting me!

385
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,538
Saul!

386
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,673
Ah! It hit him!

387
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm sorry!

388
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,109
Don't apologize!

389
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:17,244
He's a criminal's
accomplice now!

390
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,679
My apologies, Robin.

391
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:21,448
That musta scared you.

392
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,752
Wait here a sec.

393
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,387
Are you the one firing at us?

394
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,624
What if you'd hurt that poor
little girl, you damn fools?

395
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,226
Vice Admiral, please stop!

396
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,027
What're you doing?

397
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,561
I don't know about
justice anymore.

398
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:37,564
But I do know
I can protect my friend!

399
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,300
Stop it, Saul!

400
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,468
You're scaring me!

401
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:44,171
Hope you're ready 'cause if
you make an enemy outta me

402
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:48,608
there's gonna be hell to pay!

403
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,830
Robin, there's still something
I want to hear you say.

404
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,099
Tell me you want to live!

405
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,200
Robin.

406
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:20,768
Robin!

407
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:21,735
Robin.

408
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:22,770
Dear Robin.

409
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:23,671
Robin.

410
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:29,176
If I'm allowed to
say it, then I--I--

411
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:32,279
On the next One Piece:
"Say You Want to Live!

412
00:23:32,312 --> 00:23:33,714
We Are Your Friends!"

413
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
