WEBVTT

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.281
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.151
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.320
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.255
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:26.292
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.825
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.728
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:46.900
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.435
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.672
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.607
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.043
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.746
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.384
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.019
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:09.689
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.893
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.931
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.700
Luffy and his crew
arrive on Fishman Island,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.137
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.640
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.310
who were looking to destroy
the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.946
and instigated an all-out war.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.548
Luffy and his friends
thwarted their plans,

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.817
but soon became
wrapped up in the affairs

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.655
of another dangerous pirate:
Big Mom of the Four Emperors.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.193
[BIG MOM]
Forget Fishman Island.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.662
Now that you've chosen
to go against me,

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:53.766
I'll just have my
revenge on you instead!

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.103
Well then, Monkey D. Luffy.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.839
Now that I know who you are,

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.341
come here.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.676
Let's chat in the New World!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.747
Sure thing. Be there soon.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.650
I've got something I need
to settle with you, too.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:11.918
[BIG MOM]
Hm?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.388
I like this island.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.858
It's too risky to
trust you with it!

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.727
Once I get there,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.829
I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.166
And then I'll make
Fishman Island my territory!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.505
[BIG MOM growling]

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.507
[BIG MOM]
Little brat!

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.246
[LUFFY]
"Many Problems Lie Ahead!

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.049
A Trap Awaiting
in the New World!"

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:46.786
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Here.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.021
[USOPP]
Oh, thanks!

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.089
It's some of our
famous kelp tea.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.457
Please give it a try.

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:52.725
It helps with digestion,

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.428
so it'll do you good
after that big meal.

00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:01.334
It's great! Thanks for all
the hospitality, Minister!

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:03.136
Yes, you've treated
us so generously.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.971
I just hope we haven't
inconvenienced you.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.740
Oh, no. There are no words
to describe my gratitude

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.909
for what you all have
done for Fishman Island.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.644
This is the least I can do.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:16.482
Ahh. Man, it's too bad we have
to get outta here soon, huh?

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.654
[cries] Please don't talk about
leaving the island, Nose-opp!

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.590
I'm not ready to
say goodbye to you!

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.327
D-Don't cry! I'm sorry, okay?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.961
And it's Usopp.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.331
Oh, hey, where'd
Franky run off to?

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.833
He went to figure out something
with the ship earlier.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.902
Apparently there's some
trick he needs to learn

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.737
to get us back up
to the surface.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.372
Huh.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.808
Oh, yes. This must be
the list of valuables

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.210
that were stolen out of
the treasure chamber.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.244
My goodness.

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:46.946
This is more than I thought.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.949
The Tamate Box, too?

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.718
Wait, that means...

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.253
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT screams]

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.558
[CARIBOU panting]

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:01.527
Straw Hat, of course
he'd show up!

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.530
If not for him,
I would be rich by now!

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.165
[CARIBOU chuckles]

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.369
Oh well. It wasn't
a total loss, at least.

00:06:09.402 --> 00:06:12.138
Still got plenty
of treasure in me.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.474
Now I'll buy about a
hundred pirate ships,

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:15.808
so when I get to the New World,

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:18.444
I can wipe out those
damn Straw Hats!

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:19.846
Huh?

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:24.384
[CARIBOU]
What? It's gone!

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:27.387
How could someone
steal my stolen gold?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.188
I can't even afford
a piece of candy

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.157
to soothe my sorrows now!

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.494
My dear, sweet,
precious treasure!

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:38.197
Mark my words, I will find you!

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.004
[NEPTUNE]
By the way, Jimbei.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.707
Since we haven't
spoken in some time,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.010
might you tell me how the
Sun Pirates are faring?

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:53.379
Quite well. In fact,
they have so much energy,

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.782
I can scarcely keep up
with them sometimes.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.252
[NEPTUNE] Hm. If I may be
perfectly frank with you,

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.187
I never imagined
that the Sun Pirates

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.524
would align themselves
with Big Mom.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:07.226
I was quite taken
aback by the news,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.863
but perhaps that is
my ignorance speaking.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.366
Do you believe it's
a wise decision?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.602
Big Mom is ruthless,
but she lets us do as we please.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.070
It's fine for now.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.273
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm. I see.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:22.442
Then if I may be
frank once more,

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:24.377
it surprises me that
you're comfortable

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.647
taking orders from anyone
other than Fisher Tiger.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.248
No, it's all right.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.818
I'm not above working under
someone else's authority

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.419
by any means.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.555
That's the way it works
in the New World.

00:07:35.588 --> 00:07:38.791
If a captain wishes to guarantee
the safety of his crew,

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:43.162
allying with the Four Emperors
is the best way to do it.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.397
[NEPTUNE]
Is that all?

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.098
It seems to me that
you're doing it

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.001
for the good of
Fishman Island as well.

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:51.170
Even after Whitebeard's passing,

00:07:51.204 --> 00:07:54.307
our kingdom remained safe
under Big Mom's protection

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.242
because you connected
us with her.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:59.145
We can't thank you
enough for that, Jimbei.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:01.481
Oh, no. Please don't thank me.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.416
We have a responsibility
to make sure

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:06.018
Fishman Island is protected,

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:09.455
even if we are wanted criminals.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.257
[NEPTUNE chuckles]

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.825
Having said that...

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:13.759
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.495
...I believe that the
time may have come

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.531
for me to terminate my
partnership with Big Mom.

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:22.502
[NEPTUNE] Ah, so you're going
to accept Luffy's invitation?

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.671
[LUFFY]
Hey, Jimbei.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:29.208
What do you say, pal?

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:31.143
Will you join my crew?

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:35.214
Yes. I have made my decision.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.482
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.585
But the pirate world operates
through honor, not contracts.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:42.188
We'd much rather make a
verbal agreement over drinks

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.723
than sign documents.

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:46.459
Because of that, we mustn't
go breaking such agreements

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:48.361
without careful consideration.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:51.497
What concerns me the most
is the possibility that

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.700
Big Mom will direct her
anger at Fishman Island.

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.805
[NEPTUNE]
Honestly, Jimbei.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:03.342
You need not feel responsible
for every little thing.

00:09:05.244 --> 00:09:08.781
[NEPTUNE] If such an incident
comes to pass, then so be it.

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.983
I have a plan.

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:14.220
Why, just today
we took in 70,000

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:17.323
fierce newcomers
from Fishman District.

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:20.393
They'll make fine soldiers.

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:22.828
Do not worry about us, jamon.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.533
[NEPTUNE] And in the event
we lose the protection

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.802
of Big Mom's Jolly Roger,

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:33.673
there is another flag
I'd like to use instead.

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:34.707
[JIMBEI]
Hm?

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.276
[NEPTUNE] One with a
straw hat might look nice,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.278
don't you think, jamon?

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.081
[laughs] Couldn't agree more!

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:44.016
I'm partial to
that flag, myself!

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.653
[NEPTUNE, JIMBEI laughing]

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.326
[FISHMAN SOLDIERS chattering]

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:56.062
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Your Majesty!

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.632
Forgive me! But we
have a serious problem!

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:00.866
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:01.968
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
It's terrible!

00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.704
[NEPTUNE] What's the matter,
Minister of the Right?

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:07.039
I remembered something
from long ago!

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.342
With all due respect,
sir, we made a mistake

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:12.311
by letting the Straw Hat Pirates
keep that stolen treasure!

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.579
[NEPTUNE]
Hm?

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.381
I'm not certain if
they found it yet,

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.817
but if they do,
could you please ask them

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.485
to give the Tamate
Box back to us?

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:20.886
[NEPTUNE]
How dare you?!

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.722
I could never ask
them to return a gift

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.824
that we gave them for saving us!

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:26.225
I know, but...

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:29.595
[FISHMAN SOLDIERS chattering]

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.264
[NEPTUNE]
If they open it, it'll explode?!

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.567
Why would you do such a thing?!

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.335
I-I'm sorry.

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:40.239
But you see, after the Tamate
Box was stolen ten years ago,

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:42.241
I figured if another
thief were to take it,

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:43.976
we ought to teach them a lesson.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.312
I decided to rig the
box with explosives

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.547
that would detonate as soon
as the box was opened.

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.716
It seemed like a good
idea at the time.

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.254
But I was wrong!

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.223
And since I'm in charge
of the Tamate Box

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.125
and the rest of the
treasure chamber, I--

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.394
[NEPTUNE]
Very well, I understand.

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:04.397
If Luffy and the others
return with the treasures,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.067
please explain the situation
and take the Tamate Box back

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.935
before someone gets hurt.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.470
I do apologize.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.873
[NEPTUNE] Oh dear,
but there's still a chance

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.975
that they'll open it
before they get back.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:18.277
Yes, that concerns me as well.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.513
[FISHMAN SOLDIER C] Your
Majesty! Minister! An update!

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.448
Luffy and the others
have just returned.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:26.352
Ah! So they made it
back safely! That's excellent!

00:11:26.385 --> 00:11:29.021
It appears I was
worried over nothing!

00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:32.858
[NAMI, NEPTUNE, USOPP, CHOPPER]
What?!

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:33.993
[FISHMAN SOLDIERS]
Huh?

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.196
You gave the treasure...

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.098
[NEPTUNE]
...to Big Mom?

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.000
Luffy!

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.302
I had to! She was gonna
wreck the whole island

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.171
'cause she didn't get any candy!

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.505
What is her problem?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.741
I mean, if it was meat,
I'd understand.

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:51.343
But don't worry,
I already handled it.

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.280
'Cause I picked up that snail
and gave her a piece of my mind!

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:57.283
[ALL]
Seriously?!

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:59.518
Yeah, but no one
talks back to her!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.886
[ROBIN giggles]

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.257
My! That's wonderful! You sure
are brave, Luffy! [giggles]

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.693
Don't encourage him,
this isn't a good thing!

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:11.197
[SHIRAHOSHI cries] Please
don't yell at me, Nose-opp!

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.766
[USOPP]
I told you, it's Usopp!

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:16.435
Ah, whatever, I'm sorry.

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:19.004
[JIMBEI] Oh, Luffy,
what have you done now?

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:21.273
I'd better sever my
bond with Big Mom

00:12:21.307 --> 00:12:24.376
before this gets any
more complicated.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.078
I understand this
may be difficult,

00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:28.013
especially for your
hard-headed captain,

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:30.850
but please refrain from
agitating her any more!

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.118
No joke!

00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:34.787
She's one of the Four Emperors
and I'm way too young to die!

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.123
[NEPTUNE] This is even
worse than we feared!

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.991
What are we going to do now?

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:42.228
If Big Mom gets that Tamate Box
and she opens it herself,

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.730
it's going to blow up in her
face and then we're screwed!

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.799
She'll think Straw Hat's
trying to start trouble

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.300
and then there'll be
a war on our hands!

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.137
[NEPTUNE]
We mustn't let that happen!

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:56.008
[SANJI] Well, it's not like he
had any other choice, right?

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:58.244
Yeah, and it's
already been done now.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.412
Guess you kinda had to
stand up to her.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.882
I suppose I can't really be
upset at you over that.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:06.585
Exactly! I couldn't just let
her punish these guys for--

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:11.957
[FISHMAN SOLDIERS gasp]

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:13.592
[thud]

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.797
That's my girl.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.131
[NAMI]
Still.

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.600
I can't believe you gave
her all of the treasure!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.702
[BROOK, CHOPPER, USOPP]
Nami!

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:24.770
I'll punch you out!

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.939
You did that already!

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.241
[LUFFY]
Okay! Here goes!

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.476
To the New World!

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.845
[USOPP, CHOPPER, BROOK]
We're all gonna die!

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.548
[BROOK]
Well, I'm already dead, but...

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.555
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
not far from the candy factory.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:43.823
Dammit all!

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:46.091
Someone must've picked up
the treasures and ran

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.194
when I was knocked out
on the ground!

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:50.262
Whoever the thief may be,

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:53.098
I'll make sure they suffer
for what they've done!

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.701
All I have to do now is
confront those pickpockets

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:57.336
and take the riches back again!

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.804
With that and the
new information

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.139
about the Mermaid Princess,

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:02.474
I can make a good
impression for sure!

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.576
Wait a minute!

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:06.712
Who are they, and what have
they got in those bags?

00:14:07.713 --> 00:14:09.448
Straw Hat Luffy, huh?

00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:12.418
What makes that punk think
he can pick a fight with Mama?

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.921
Me oui, the monsieur does have
a certain je ne sais quoi.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.090
She must be furious.

00:14:18.123 --> 00:14:20.526
[PEKOMS]
The tea party's in four days.

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:24.163
I say we get her as many treats
as we can on the way back.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:27.399
We can't fix it, but hopefully
we can soften the blow.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:28.801
At least a little bit.

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.437
[TAMAGO] Indeed, hopefully
a détente a la sweets

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.872
will be adequate.

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:35.608
And I am sure the
treasures won't hurt.

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.877
I knew it! Those are mine!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.112
Just wait till I catch you two!

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.448
I'll bury you alive!

00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.617
I stole those treasures once.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.920
That means I can
steal them again!

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:48.988
Pardón?

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.058
I feel like I've seen that
ugly mug before, garrr!

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.593
There he is.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.428
It says here he's
an up-and-comer,

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:59.031
goes by the name
"Wet-Haired" Caribou, grr.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:02.034
Oh, so he's worth 200 million.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.236
Great! Just when we
thought this was over!

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:09.508
[CARIBOU chuckles] It's too
late for you to beg for mercy!

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.777
[laughs]

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.247
[CARIBOU]
Swamp-Swamp Gatling Gun!

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:25.557
[CARIBOU laughing]

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.759
Sorry, boys!

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:32.431
That's what happens
when you steal from me!

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:51.016
[laughing]

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:53.485
[FISHWOMAN A screams]

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.087
This is crazy!

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.623
[CROWD murmuring]

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.959
[CARIBOU laughs]

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:08.200
[laughs] Huh?

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.135
Wait, what?

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.910
[CARIBOU]
Huh? A turtle?

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.391
Devil Fruit power?

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:35.494
[PEKOMS] Of course!
What else would it be?

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:39.631
[chuckles] A turtle
Zoan-type, huh?

00:16:39.665 --> 00:16:42.368
Who cares! [cackles]

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:44.937
You don't scare me!

00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:46.705
[CARIBOU]
Huh?

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.108
[PEKOMS grunts]

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:53.712
[CARIBOU groans]

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:01.453
[CROWD gasps]

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:04.823
[CARIBOU groans]

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.358
[growls]

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.206
People with Logia
Devil Fruit powers

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.841
always end up dying young.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.578
You fools think that power
makes you invincible, grr.

00:17:26.612 --> 00:17:30.115
Half-boiled challengers
are tres disappointing.

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:33.318
Allons-y, Monsieur Pekoms.

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.454
Mama's waiting.

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:39.892
[FISHMAN C] That guy's worth
200 million, a-and he just...

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:44.396
If I remember, Pekoms has
a bounty of 330 million.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.998
That's pretty scary!

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:48.267
And Big Mom probably
makes what he just did

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.269
look like child's play!

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.272
[FISHMAN D] I sure hope Luffy
knows what he's doing.

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:10.422
[CROWD chattering]

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.458
This is quite a sendoff.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:17.229
[LUFFY]
There's the Sunny.

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.498
[USOPP]
Yeah, I see Franky!

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.467
He looks like he's
ready to set sail.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.503
Hey! Franky!

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.575
I can't wait!

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.119
[NARRATOR]
And, somewhere near the Red Line

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.821
in the waters of the New World.

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:48.393
[bell tolling]

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:50.129
[MARINE C]
Urgent report from headquarters!

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.231
Several coated ships are
ascending from the sea floor

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.233
at high speed!

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:56.335
[MARINE D]
All hands to stations, now!

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:59.738
I repeat, everyone get
to your posts, quickly!

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.147
[gasps] What the--?

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.993
Tha--That's a pirate ship!

00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.512
Fire!

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.383
[PIRATES yelling]

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:45.584
[MARINE E groans]

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.885
[ALL grunting]

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:47.719
[MARINE OFFICER A]
Hurry up!

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:50.189
There's another
one at two o'clock!

00:19:50.222 --> 00:19:51.356
[MARINE F]
Pirate ships are popping up

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.026
all over the place, sir!

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.028
What the hell is this?

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:06.838
[MARINES chuckling]

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:09.708
[G-5 MARINE A chuckles]

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.311
[G-5 MARINE B] Tryin' to get on
her good side, you suck-up?

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:15.347
Mind your own business!

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.649
They final set me free
from that living hell!

00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:20.185
I can't die now!

00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:22.387
[G-5 MARINE N]
Here comes a big one!

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:25.490
[G-5 MARINE D]
Captain, look out!

00:20:25.524 --> 00:20:27.593
[G-5 MARINE E] I'll shield
you from harm, Captain!

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:30.429
[G-5 MARINE F]
Outta the way, I wanna do it!

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:31.496
[TASHIGI]
Move!

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:33.765
[gasps, groans]

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:35.234
[TASHIGI]
I've got it!

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.041
[G-5 MARINES cheer]

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.277
Whoo! That's our captain for ya!

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.247
[G-5 MARINE H whistles] That was
really beautiful, Captain!

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.183
Yeah, and the swordplay
wasn't half bad either!

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.585
[TASHIGI] Are you taking
this seriously or not?

00:20:53.619 --> 00:20:55.621
[G-5 MARINES chuckle]

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:58.390
Every one of you should know
how to deflect a bombshell!

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:00.525
There was never a better
time to use that skill

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.426
than just now, so--

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.928
[G-5 MARINE J]
Um, that's a mast.

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:04.396
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.164
Here, I cleaned your
glasses for you.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.899
[TASHIGI]
Uh--uh, thank you.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:09.401
[G-5 MARINE K]
She's so cute!

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.536
She's like a flower
among this filthy crew!

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.239
You know, I'd die for you
in a heartbeat, Captain!

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.540
[G-5 MARINE O]
Yeah, me, too!

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:18.176
Don't fool around in
the middle of combat!

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.911
You'll get yourselves killed.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.014
The G-5 is such a joke!

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.149
And to think you're
all Navy soldiers!

00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:25.450
[G-5 MARINE A giggles]

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:27.052
You had better not
take me lightly

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:28.220
just because I'm a woman!

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:30.355
Aw, Captain Tashigi!

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.392
You're just so adorable,
how could I not respect you?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.861
That's exactly the kind
of treatment I mean!

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:38.096
There's a difference between
respect and whatever you--

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.598
Keep it down, Tashigi.

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.266
[ALL gasp]

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.001
[SMOKER]
I'm busy.

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.270
My apologies, sir!

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:48.473
[SMOKER] I see. So a
pirate from the seafloor

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:51.743
named Hordy Jones
took you captive?

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.445
That explains a lot.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.213
That must be why
there were no rookies

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.616
passing through
Fishman Island recently.

00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:59.785
Took us captive? I wish!

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.286
He made us his slaves!

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.790
Hordy stirred up some kind of
civil war on Fishman Island.

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.658
He made us fight for his side.

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:09.394
And then this group of
pirates set us free!

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.163
[SMOKER]
A group of pirates?

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:13.165
Yeah, but I'm not
telling you who!

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:15.367
[PIRATE C gasps]
Don't be stupid!

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.235
Can't you see who
we're dealing with?

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:20.972
They're not just Navy soldiers,
they're the G-5!

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.809
They use pirates as bait
when they fish for sharks,

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.311
or even as kindling
for a bonfire!

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:29.348
[PIRATE C] They're the
rogue unit of the Navy!

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.683
They don't even obey
orders from HQ!

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:34.820
Trust me, you have no idea how
ruthless these bastards are!

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:37.255
Of all the people
to be caught by,

00:22:37.289 --> 00:22:38.790
we had to end up in the hands of

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:41.927
the notorious
"White Chase" Smoker!

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:50.969
Well, Vice-Admiral? Can we
take over from here? [chuckles]

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.904
[PIRATE B screams]
No, I beg you!

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.473
[PIRATE C gasps]
I'll tell you everything!

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.707
Please! Have mercy!

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:57.275
[chuckles]

00:22:57.309 --> 00:23:00.212
The ones who defeated
Hordy Jones and his crew.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.017
It was the Straw Hat
Pirates, okay?

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:08.820
I know that already.

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:10.188
Idiot.

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:16.061
[NARRATOR] Filled with both
excitement and trepidation,

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:18.764
the crew finally sets
sail for the New World.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.532
After bidding their
fond farewells,

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:23.468
the Straw Hats leave with
a new Log Pose in hand.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:26.104
Luffy makes a promise
to the tearful Shirahoshi

00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:28.507
and recalls an old vow
he made to Shanks.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.075
Overcoming trials and tragedies,

00:23:30.108 --> 00:23:32.077
Luffy's dream is on
course once again!

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.712
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:37.082
"Finally Time to Go!
Goodbye, Fishman Island!"

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.851
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
