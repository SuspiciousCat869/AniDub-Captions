00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,540
Why, it reminds me
of the old days

175
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,625
when I was young and irreverent.

176
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,003
Uh‐oh. What'd they'd say?

177
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,631
Hey! There's no point
gettin' so worked up, fella.

178
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,967
Ha‐ha! Try to relax!

179
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,803
And who put us
behind schedule again?

180
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,430
You know what, he's right.

181
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,889
Being tense won't
get us anywhere.

182
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,100
We may as well enjoy ourselves.

183
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,811
I see your point.
Full speed ahead, men.

184
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,981
Anyone not relaxing
answers to me.

185
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,566
[SHOJO CREW sighs]

186
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,110
[LUFFY]
Ahh. That's better.

187
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,903
[MASIRA CREW sighs]

188
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,324
[ZORO]
This is ridiculous.

189
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,330
Wait. What's over there?

190
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,832
The sky! It's dark!

191
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,668
[MASIRA CREWMAN A]
Boss! Look!

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,753
What's wrong?

193
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,465
I see the cumuloregalis cloud!
To the southwest!

194
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,050
[MASIRA]
It can't be! What time is it?

195
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,468
[MASIRA CREWMAN A]
Ten o'clock!

196
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,637
They're a full hour early!

197
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,473
[MASIRA] Shojo! Do you
think we can make it?

198
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,475
[SHOJO]
Dispatch the Utan Divers!

199
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,560
Find me those currents!

200
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,774
[NAMI]
They're incredible!

201
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,568
What's going on now?

202
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,070
The cumuloregalis
clouds appeared

203
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,529
a lot sooner than expected,

204
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,698
so now everyone's scrambling
to find a current!

205
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,952
[screams]

206
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,124
Sonar waves detected!

207
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,043
There's a large current
at 12 o'clock!

208
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,170
[SHOJO CREWMAN B] Large creature
detected at nine o'clock!

209
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,047
It could be a Sea King!

210
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,550
There's wave activity
detected at ten o'clock

211
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,802
going against the current!

212
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,054
I believe it's a giant
whirlpool, sir!

213
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,391
That's it! Full speed ahead
directly for ten o'clock!

214
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,142
That's where the Knockup
Stream's gonna erupt,

215
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,102
I'm sure of it!

216
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,645
Now go!

217
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,900
Hold on!

218
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,902
[NAMI]
The waves are getting higher!

219
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,029
[USOPP]
We're gonna sink!

220
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,826
[MASIRA] Steady, men.
It's a pre‐eruption tremor!

221
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,119
[CHOPPER]
Eruption?!

222
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,872
Hey, Navigator! What
does the Log Pose say?

223
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,044
It's pointing straight
at those clouds!

224
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,922
[USOPP] You mean the sky
island's above that?

225
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,590
The wind direction's perfect.

226
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
The clouds are lining
up exactly over

227
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,136
the center of the whirlpool.

228
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,639
[LUFFY] What whirlpool?
I haven't seen anything.

229
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,932
Nice work, brother!

230
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,101
I think we hit the
jackpot this time.

231
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,563
Yes! And it seems we're in
for a nice‐sized explosion!

232
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,064
[LUFFY]
Do you think we'll make it?

233
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,733
[MASIRA]
Of course!

234
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,193
What's that?

235
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,654
We'll lead you
to the inner edge.

236
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,865
All right. But what
should we do?

237
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,951
Position yourself on the flow
and head towards the center.

238
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,620
Then you'll be fine.

239
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
[NAMI]
He wants us to go to the center?

240
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,733
[CRICKET] I've never met a group
of characters like them before.

241
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,651
You mean there's no sky island?

242
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,819
Are you for sure?

243
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,655
Cricket's gold! It's all gone!

244
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,783
I'll be back by morning, guys.

245
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,951
[chuckles]

246
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,287
[LUFFY]
See ya around, Pops!

247
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,251
[CRICKET]
Always yappin' about dreams.

248
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,213
[USOPP]
But I don't wanna get sucked in!

249
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,803
I don't remember
signing up for all this!

250
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,678
[SANJI]
Don't worry!

251
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,889
I'll make sure nothing
happens to you!

252
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,642
[ROBIN] I've never seen one
quite this big before.

253
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,394
[chuckles]

254
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,272
This is bad! I change my
mind! I wanna go back!

255
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,358
[ZORO]
Sorry, Usopp, too late for that.

256
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,485
"You know who"
is already excited.

257
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,570
Let's go! To the sky!

258
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,739
[laughs]

259
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,203
[CHOPPER, USOPP wheezing]

260
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,271
[MASIRA]
It's time for us to go!

261
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,858
The rest is up to
you now! Good luck!

262
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,026
Bye, guys! And thanks
a lot for everything!

263
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,319
Don't go!

264
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,530
Don't go! I don't want to die!

265
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,367
Please, take me with you!
Gimme a break, I'm scared!

266
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,035
Please don't make me!

267
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,413
[NAMI] No one said anything
about diving head first

268
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,873
into a giant whirlpool!

269
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,291
[USOPP]
Why's it getting dark?!

270
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,502
[CHOPPER]
Oh, no! We're being sucked in!

271
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,920
Don't be so unreasonable, Luffy!

272
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,755
Let's go back while
we still have time!

273
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,591
Don't you understand
this sky island stuff

274
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,925
is just a bunch of make‐believe?

275
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,511
It's not worth
getting us killed!

276
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,264
It's all make believe?
Is that what you think?

277
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,642
Usopp's right! I think
this is a really bad idea!

278
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,688
[LUFFY] It may be a stupid
dream, but I have to try.

279
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,399
It could be our
greatest adventure!

280
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,319
[USOPP, NAMI]
No. It's too late.

281
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,616
Instead of wasting
your time bickering,

282
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,701
you all might wanna take a look.

283
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,036
What do you mean?

284
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,749
[ZORO]
It's sucking us in.

285
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,293
[STRAW HATS yelling]

286
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,962
[SANJI] Hurry, Nami!
Let my arms protect you!

287
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,965
[STRAW HATS screaming]

288
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,927
[screaming]

289
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
[SANJI]
What happened? It disappeared.

290
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,808
[LUFFY]
What's goin' on?

291
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,478
[USOPP]
Wait. I‐I don't get it.

292
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,812
Where'd it go?

293
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,570
I feel it.

294
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,322
It's starting.

295
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,743
[NAMI] The whirlpool sunk
under the surface.

296
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,414
[USOPP]
You don't mean...

297
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,875
[BLACKBEARD]
Hold it right there!

298
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,338
Hey, uh, Zoro?

299
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,506
Look.

300
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:10,511
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

301
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,807
[BLACKBEARD]
Well, well, well.

302
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,018
If it isn't Straw Hat Luffy.

303
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,854
It's him. It's that
Mock Town guy!

304
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,524
What guy?

305
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,858
I've come all this
way to collect

306
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,860
on your hundred‐
million‐Berry bounty!

307
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,779
So don't be shy!

308
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,409
[BLACKBEARD laughing]

309
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,078
[SHOJO] Were those youngsters
expecting some company?

310
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,039
[MASIRA]
I don't know, brother.

311
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,878
Hm? Why's it getting
dark out here?

312
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,007
Hundred million?
What're you talkin' about?

313
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,718
Don't play dumb with me, kid.

314
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,011
It says right here.

315
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,639
Monkey D. Luffy wanted
for a hundred million.

316
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,060
And for Pirate Hunter Zoro:
60 million Berries!

317
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,063
It's true. He's got a different
poster for each of you.

318
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,483
Hey, Zoro. Congratulations
on your new bounty! Ha!

319
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,985
[SANJI]
Wait a minute, Usopp!

320
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,446
Come on. Do you see one for me?

321
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,905
[USOPP]
Uh, no.

322
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,782
Look closer.

323
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,992
Nothin'.

324
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,996
It looks like your bounties
must've gone way up

325
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,748
after the Alabasta incident.

326
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,916
But a hundred million?

327
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,084
[LUFFY]
This is great!

328
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,546
Hear that? My bounty
went up big time!

329
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,380
[ZORO chuckles]

330
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,716
Sixty million's not
too bad either.

331
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,760
It's not a good thing!

332
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:39,058
[SHOJO] Make sure to keep your
eyes open, Going Merry crew!

333
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,857
It's here. I hope
they're ready for it.

334
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,193
[SHOJO]
Brace yourselves!

335
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,405
[BLACKBEARD]
Huh?

336
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,699
[SANJI]
Everyone hold on or get inside!

337
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,409
[USOPP screaming]

338
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,246
[USOPP] Oh, no! The ship!
It's being lifted up!

339
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,708
[USOPP crying]

340
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,804
[ALL screaming]

341
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,329
[MASIRA CREWMAN B]
Help! We're gonna capsize!

342
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,626
Hold steady!

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,711
Don't let go, men!

344
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,717
[MASIRA, SHOJO]
Go sky island!

345
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,178
[STRAW HATS yelling]

346
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,763
[USOPP]
What's happening?!

347
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,266
[SANJI] We're sailing up
a huge pillar of water!

348
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,809
[LUFFY]
This is awesome!

349
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,311
[USOPP]
How are we doing this?!

350
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,981
Wind.

351
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,318
[LUFFY] All right! I can't
believe it's finally happening.

352
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,363
Let's go to Skypeia!

353
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,451
Hold on. It's not gonna
be that easy. Look!

354
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,411
Oh, what now?!

355
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,455
What's wrong? Did we
forget about something?

356
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,166
[SANJI]
The hull's starting to float!

357
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,417
[NAMI]
Huh?

358
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,794
[SANJI] If we don't stop it,
we're gonna fall into the ocean!

359
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,462
[USOPP] What do ya expect
us to do about it?

360
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,798
We're having a hard enough
time holding on as it is,

361
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,176
or haven't you noticed?

362
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,803
Oh, no! What is that?!

363
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,721
[ZORO]
The Sea King!

364
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,265
[CHOPPER]
Is that the one from before?!

365
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,979
See, it's only a matter of time

366
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,356
before the same thing
happens to the Merry!

367
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,692
I know! But what can we do?

368
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,943
We don't have a
whole lot of options

369
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,695
when it comes to mother nature.

370
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,779
We're at her mercy.

371
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,200
[SANJI] I guess we hold on
and hope for the best!

372
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,619
[screams]

373
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,913
Ships are falling from the sky!

374
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,248
We're gonna end up
driftwood, just like them!

375
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,542
[USOPP] We're gonna take a nose
dive to the bottom of the ocean

376
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,338
all because Luffy had to
follow some stupid dream!

377
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,592
[NAMI]
Spread the sails! Right now!

378
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,678
Sure it's a pillar of water,
but it's still part of the sea.

379
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,639
It's a rising current!

380
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,807
The wind from below is
a rising air current

381
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,228
produced by geothermal heat,
causing a steam explosion!

382
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,564
It may be packaged differently,
but it's still wind and water!

383
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,400
Trust me. I'm a
navigator, aren't I?

384
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,987
[SANJI]
Thank you, Nami!

385
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,907
All right, gang!
Nami's leading the way!

386
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,533
[STRAW HATS]
Yeah!

387
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,452
[NAMI] All right, guys,
catch the starboard wind

388
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,912
and align the ship
with the current!

389
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,580
[STRAW HATS]
Yes, ma'am!

390
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,918
Hey, we're rising up off
the water! Is that okay?

391
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,588
[LUFFY] Nami, do something!
We're gonna fall!

392
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,632
Come on. Do it!

393
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,887
[LUFFY]
We're flying!

394
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,976
Yeah! We're headed to the sky!

395
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,270
We made it.

396
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,771
[screams]

397
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,939
I did it!

398
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,440
Yes!

399
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,943
Nami! Good job!

400
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,612
I think I love you!

401
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,782
[CRICKET]
Go for it, kid!

402
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,493
Always remember
to keep dreaming!

403
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,959
[MASIRA, SHOJO]
Yeah!

404
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,502
[NAMI]
If the wind keeps this up,

405
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,547
we can sail as high as we want!

406
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,967
Hey, Nami! Are we
almost to Skypeia?

407
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,846
If it exists, it's
past those clouds!

408
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,015
[LUFFY]
Past the clouds!

409
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,351
I can't wait to find out
what's up in the sky!

410
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,895
Let's bust through
'em and find out!

411
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,982

[SANJI]
What is this place?

427
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,902
[LUFFY]
It's solid white!

428
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,821

It's like an ocean in the sky!

What a strange creature...

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,575
Is it a fish?

[USOPP]
What is that?!

00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,953
[ZORO]
What now?

434
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,579
[SANJI]
Look! Someone's coming!

435
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,206

the Gate in the Clouds!"
