1
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:38,225
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,096
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,399
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:50,370
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,239
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,340
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,179
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,416
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,653
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,055
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,227
[SPANDAM] I admit, it was
scary for a while there,

13
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,062
but I finally made it.

14
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,363
Once I step through those gates,

15
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,332
I'll be the government's hero.

16
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,135
No, I will be a hero
to the entire world!

17
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,638
[FRANKY]
Lucci, huh?

18
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,774
He givin' you a hard
time, or something?

19
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,109
By the way, I brought
you two keys.

20
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,678
Though I guess Robin's not here.

21
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,112
Should I lend you a hand?

22
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:32,713
No.

23
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,515
Leave this guy to me.

24
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,718
You should go after Robin.

25
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,420
You can get to the
Gates of Justice

26
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,622
through that door
behind the pigeon guy.

27
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,625
Robin left a while back,
so we're running out of time.

28
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,727
Keep going and don't look back.

29
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,231
You can super
count on me, brother.

30
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,238
Thank you for waiting.

31
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,276
[KAKU]
Never mind the neck.

32
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,579
If I can control the
reach of all four limbs,

33
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,048
my blades will be unstoppable!

34
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,120
[KAKU] Perhaps you were so
distracted by my Giraffe Powers,

35
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,590
that you forgot I'm a master
of the Four Sword Style!

36
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,125
You've done well thus far,

37
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,293
but this battle is over now!

38
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,634
[ZORO] Even if you have
the power of a wild animal.

39
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:30,371
Even if you can attack with
that long neck of yours.

40
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:34,241
Even if you can use
the Four-Sword Style.

41
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,713
What?

42
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,749
He deflected all four blades?

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,821
None of those
things will give you

44
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,156
the strength it
takes to defeat me!

45
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,319
You're all talk.

46
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,820
If you think you
can take me down,

47
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:22,222
then let's see what you've got!

48
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,061
Three-Sword Style.

49
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:31,298
Leopard Spinning--

50
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,501
[KAKU]
Is he flying at me?

51
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,203
[ZORO]
Shot!

52
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,779
[KAKU]
Impossible!

53
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,215
I thought for sure he missed me!

54
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,322
[KAKU]
What was that?

55
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,661
[KAKU] Did he somehow predict
which way I would dodge?

56
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,532
Oh, come on.

57
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,568
Don't look so surprised.

58
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,336
The way you fight,
I find it hard to believe

59
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,339
this is the first time you've
been touched by a blade.

60
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,508
Well, it seems you have

61
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,710
a little something
to back up your boast.

62
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,812
I won't underestimate you again.

63
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,649
But I'm afraid that one hit
is the best you're going to do.

64
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,050
I have four swords,

65
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,219
Six Powers and the
immeasurable strength

66
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,687
of a giraffe on my side.

67
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,623
That's an equation for victory
if I've ever heard one.

68
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:31,058
So don't blink!

69
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,260
This'll be over in a flash!

70
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,662
Tempest Kick Shuriken!

71
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,237
Now, Giraffe Blast!

72
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,642
[ZORO]
Dammit!

73
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:54,514
My neck's like a whip. Whiplash!

74
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,157
Even faster! Fierce Smash!

75
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,494
[KAKU]
How do you like this?

76
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,729
Still think you can defeat me?

77
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,103
And now for a taste
of my Four-Sword Style.

78
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,470
Prepare yourself.

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,341
[KAKU]
Fury Slash!

80
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:27,614
Here I come.

81
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,220
[ZORO]
Damn, I can barely keep up!

82
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,187
[KAKU]
Hey, what's wrong?

83
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,624
All you're doing is
blocking! Give it up!

84
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,226
You don't have what
it takes to beat me!

85
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,199
[KAKU]
You pirates were sorely mistaken

86
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,500
if you thought you could defy

87
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,702
the World Government
and survive.

88
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,171
In the name of justice,

89
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,474
a mistake that severe can
only be punished by death!

90
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,675
The same goes for Nico Robin!

91
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,084
[ZORO]
You bastard.

92
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,237
[KAKU]
What the hell was that?

93
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,238
He looked like a demon;

94
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:28,342
a god of war, with
three faces, and six arms!

95
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,110
That can't be possible.

96
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,078
Was I seeing things?

97
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,650
Your mouth just
crossed the line.

98
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,420
Now you're gonna pay,
you arrogant freak.

99
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,622
Oh, did I offend you?

100
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,324
Well, if you're tired
of hearing me talk,

101
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,325
I'll just end this now

102
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,193
with the same move
that crippled this tower.

103
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,333
This will be over in an instant

104
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,201
when I slice you in two!

105
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,369
It's the end of the line!

106
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,071
There's nowhere to run!

107
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,572
This time, I'll make my attack

108
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,774
twice as powerful as before!

109
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,250
Yeah, you're right.

110
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,218
It is the end of the line.

111
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,119
For you, at least.

112
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:26,466
Demon Aura Nine-Sword
Style Asura!

113
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,473
It's that demon I saw before!

114
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:35,776
Is he making that illusion
with his strength of will alone?

115
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,479
Nice try, but you're too late!

116
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,381
Is it too late for me?

117
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,616
Or for you?

118
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,385
[KAKU] Unless you
somehow manage to dodge

119
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,621
this Tempest Kick,
then nothing has changed!

120
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,422
You're all talk!

121
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,591
Sky Slicer!

122
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,049
That's impossible!

123
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,119
He slashed it into mist!

124
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,221
[ZORO]
You did well.

125
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,523
I commend you!

126
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,259
Suffering is welcome
on the path to bloodshed!

127
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:40,140
[ZORO]
Asura Silver Mist!

128
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,558
[ZORO]
I got a message for you,

129
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,594
from your other boss
over at Galley-La.

130
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,531
[PAULIE]
When you see 'em,

131
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,535
I want you to pass
on a message for me.

132
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,736
He said.

133
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,272
"You're all fired."

134
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,594
How could you do this?

135
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:07,661
You tricked me!

136
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,330
I thought you were my friends!

137
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:18,105
Paulie. I see.

138
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,473
Fired, huh?

139
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,475
Too bad. It'll be tough.

140
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,310
Assassination
skills don't really

141
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,280
come in handy in
other lines of work.

142
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,182
You can always get
a job at the zoo.

143
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,323
Nice. That's a good one.

144
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,354
Sorry.

145
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,537
[running footsteps]

146
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,040
Hey, Moss Head!

147
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,308
Did you get a key?

148
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,543
[ZORO]
Yeah. Just now.

149
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,412
Got it right here.

150
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,447
That's good news.

151
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,215
Seems like you two might have

152
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,617
overdone it a bit, though.

153
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,419
Tower isn't looking so good.

154
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:39,486
You think it's safe?

155
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,721
[ZORO]
Safe enough.

156
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,156
Who cares, anyway?

157
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,159
That's not important right now.

158
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,260
There you go.

159
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,494
That was the last one.

160
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,396
Now we have all of the keys.

161
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,036
Yeah.

162
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,638
We'd better hurry
and get them to Robin.

163
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,580
[ZAMBAI ]
Run! Full speed!

164
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,449
Don't stop!

165
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:11,685
Keep moving no matter what!

166
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,621
We need to save ourselves

167
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,756
and just trust that Bro and
the Straw Hats will be safe!

168
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,157
We're all gonna make it!

169
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,192
Gero!

170
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,260
[ZAMBAI]
So run for your lives!

171
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,628
Even if we break our legs

172
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,763
the Franky Family
ain't stopping!

173
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,531
Yeah!

174
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:28,068
[FRANK FAMILY]
Go! You can do it!

175
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,471
[FRANK FAMILY]
We're counting on you, giants!

176
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:31,605
[KASHII]
Listen, guys.

177
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,508
If you're just gonna ride,
then try to keep it down!

178
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,212
[OIMO]
Oi, I agree! Enough, already!

179
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,316
[ZAMBAI] Forward! Go,
in the name of Elbath!

180
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,717
[OIMO and KASHII]
Shut up!

181
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,189
Granny, hurry! Faster, faster!

182
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,791
Chimney, I'm an old woman!

183
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:53,394
Gimme a break, here!

184
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:58,432
Seriously, I'm gonna have
to refuel to keep this up!

185
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,434
Whoa! Granny!

186
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,304
He's gonna fall!
Pull him up! Pull him up!

187
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,238
[KOKORO]
Geez!

188
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,806
You sure are demanding today.

189
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,673
[CHIMNEY]
Granny!

190
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:09,476
[KOKORO]
I know, I know! "Hurry! Hurry!"

191
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,129
[SPANDAM]
Finally!

192
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,497
The bridge is connected!

193
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,701
Hahahahahaha!
I can't stop laughing!

194
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:08,535
Hey! Gate Guards!

195
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,371
[MARINE]
Is everything ready or what?

196
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:10,938
Yes, sir!

197
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,006
Everything is in order!

198
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,707
We're awaiting your
arrival by the third column.

199
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,608
That's not what I meant!

200
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,577
The crew should come
out to salute me!

201
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,479
Their hero,
Chief Spandam, has arrived!

202
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,546
[MARINE]
Oh, uh, yes sir!

203
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,814
We'll be right out!

204
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:21,514
[SPANDAM]
Idiots.

205
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,816
They can't do anything right!

206
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,152
Look, Nico Robin. There it is!

207
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,623
That little gate's
the real entrance.

208
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,092
Just a few more steps
and we're there.

209
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,227
Once you pass through it,

210
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,628
you'll be crossing the border

211
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,529
between heaven and hell.

212
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,498
There's no turning back!

213
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,133
And the moment
I drag you past it,

214
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,735
my name will be
engraved in history!

215
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,667
Hey-hey-hey there, witch!

216
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,169
Where do you think you're going?

217
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,473
I know you may not believe me,

218
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,676
but I do feel a
bit sorry for you.

219
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,079
Too bad I've got
no say in the matter.

220
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,114
There's no reason
for you to live.

221
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:30,150
Your death awaits.

222
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,287
You bitch!

223
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,160
[ROBIN]
I don't want to die!

224
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:45,031
I don't want to die!
I want to live!

225
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,713
[SPANDAM]
Stop delaying the inevitable!

226
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,382
You're wasting time! Get up!

227
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,653
Damn it all. She won't budge.

228
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,320
What's going on here?

229
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,293
You're kidding me!

230
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,697
She's holding on to
the bridge with her teeth?

231
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,333
She just doesn't know
when to give up, does she?

232
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,601
How annoying!

233
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,304
Why the hell are you
so desperate to live?

234
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,105
Don't be so damn greedy!

235
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,073
Listen to me!

236
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,474
You're a criminal, understand?

237
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,576
The only way you can make

238
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,611
the world a better
place is by dying!

239
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:32,246
Why must you be
such an annoyance

240
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,248
all the way to the bitter end?

241
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,617
[ROBIN] I never thought
I would be so afraid of death.

242
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:47,694
I want to live! Please! Save me!

243
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,430
Luffy!

244
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,168
Finger Pistol!

245
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,538
I told you, that won't work!

246
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,007
[LUCCI]
Yellow Lotus!

247
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,778
[FRANKY]
Straw Hat!

248
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,247
No. Wait.

249
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,481
I can't worry about him.

250
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,716
My only concern
is getting through

251
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,784
those doors, and fast!

252
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,588
It's no use.

253
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,091
There's no way you'll
ever get past me.

254
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:18,792
We'll just have to see
about that, won't we?

255
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,127
Have some Strong--

256
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,495
Iron Body.

257
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,330
Hammer!

258
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:39,113
No way.

259
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,547
He didn't even flinch!

260
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,752
That same punch sent that
"Chapapa" freak flying!

261
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,553
Ah, I see.

262
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,522
You beat Fukurou along the way?

263
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,157
Sorry to break it to you,

264
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,560
but my power level
is five times his.

265
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,806
Still, I'm impressed you
defeated Fukurou.

266
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,677
Bringing down any agent of CP9
requires super-human strength.

267
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,678
[FRANKY]
Whoa.

268
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,614
This guy's in a completely
different league!

269
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,683
Now. You die.

270
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,251
Gum-Gum...

271
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,752
...Jet Pistol!

272
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,467
What the hell? What happened?

273
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,470
And what's with all that steam?

274
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,245
[LUFFY]
Second Gear.

275
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,757
I can't keep my
body like this for long.

276
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,425
But I'll damn sure stop him,

277
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,794
so you go on ahead, and hurry!

278
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:03,530
Robin's waiting!

279
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:05,366
Right! You got it!

280
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:06,667
I have no idea
what you're doing,

281
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,735
but keep it up and finish him!

282
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,042
[LUCCI]
I said you'll never get past me.

283
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:18,612
Didn't I?

284
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:22,082
Another guy with
Devil Fruit Powers?

285
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,183
[LUCCI]
First thing's first.

286
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,218
Time to die, Franky.

287
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,258
Jet Whip!

288
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,167
[LUCCI]
Have you forgotten something?

289
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,635
Back in the Galley-La building,

290
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,037
this is the form I was in

291
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,040
when I defeated
you with a single blow.

292
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,042
Yeah. Sure.

293
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,310
But I was real hungry that day.

294
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:55,616
[LUCCI]
Shave! Finger Pistol!

295
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,351
Gum-Gum...

296
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,520
Iron Body!

297
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:02,756
...Jet Bazooka!

298
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,098
Franky! You gotta save her!

299
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,536
Just super leave it to me!

300
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,448
[SPANDAM]
Stupid woman!

301
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,383
Don't you get it?
This is useless!

302
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,518
How many times
do I have to tell you?

303
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:35,155
There's no hope for you
so just give it up now!

304
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,624
[ROBIN]
I'm not going anywhere!

305
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,392
They're coming!

306
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,328
They're all coming to rescue me!

307
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:16,730
[SPANDAM] Ahahahaha!
Watch carefully, men,

308
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,499
because you're about
to witness the first step

309
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:22,503
of a hero that is destined
to go down in history!

310
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:23,137
[MARINE]
Chief!

311
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,405
[SPANDAM]
Over there!

312
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,372
[MARINE]
What?

313
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,507
[SPANDAM]
Over where?

314
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,543
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

315
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,380
"Spandam Frightened!
The Hero on the Tower of Law."

316
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,049
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
