00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,282
Uh, can we hold
off a little while?

176
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,950
What, are we supposed
to hang around here

177
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,419
cooling our heels while you
play another game of chess?

178
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,488
I can't quit playing now, okay?

179
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,123
I lost so many games to Gramps

180
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,092
that I ended up pawning
the ship to him!

181
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,161
You what?!

182
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,097
What are pirates who lost their
ship supposed to do, huh?

183
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,600
Don't worry, guys,
I'm sure that I can get it back!

184
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,434
[ZENNY]
Checkmate!

185
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,535
[NAMI yells]

186
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,436
[GROUP yells]

187
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,437
[USOPP]
Stop playing!

188
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,605
[CHOPPER]
Earthquake!

189
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,373
[USOPP] If you don't stop
playing this stupid game now,

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,642
who knows what else
we're gonna end up losing!

191
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,311
[ZENNY] If you want
to get your ship back,

192
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,279
then you're just going to
have to work on this island

193
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,515
until you've paid me back
as much as it's worth.

194
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,986
By my reckoning,
you're gonna be working for me

195
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,521
for the next ten years.

196
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,989
So how's tricks with you?

197
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,958
[laughing]

198
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,661
‐‐[LUFFY] Nami!
‐‐[SANJI] Nami, sweetheart!

199
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,129
[NAMI]
I'm sorry!

200
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,298
I thought if I got lucky
I could get the old guy

201
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,701
to tell us where his
treasure's stashed away!

202
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,403
[USOPP] Are you still
going on about that?

203
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,472
Our only option now
is to leave the old man

204
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,140
and run away. Who's with me?

205
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,141
[LUFFY]
Uh‐uh, not me.

206
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,043
Come on, what are you
talking about, Luffy?

207
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,145
We're all just lucky that
Zoro was paying attention,

208
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,147
'cause if he hadn't been, we
might've spent the rest of

209
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,083
our lives on this island
waiting on that old man

210
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,150
hand and foot!

211
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,318
You just gotta accept it!

212
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,721
You're not gonna have any
adventures around here, Luffy.

213
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,222
It's time we were moving on.

214
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,590
‐‐No way.
‐‐Luffy!

215
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,260
A gambling wager is just
like a promise, isn't it?

216
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,428
I'm not going to do
anything to break a promise.

217
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,764
This is no time to
get hung up on details!

218
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,000
Zoro, what do you
think we should do?

219
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,369
Hey, the captain is
the one who decides this.

220
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,203
Luffy!

221
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,405
I said no and that's
what I meant!

222
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,673
That's checkmate.

223
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,741
[GROUP]
Hm?

224
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,512
Well I'll be.

225
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,514
Looks like we can
get the ship back.

226
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,715
[chuckles]

227
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,751
[GROUP chuckles]

228
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,686
Well, old man, give up?

229
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,023
You win.

230
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,591
[GROUP]
Hooray!

231
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,693
Looks like we can
always count on you,

232
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,061
right, Big Sister?

233
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,629
So how's tricks with you?

234
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,231
Don't rub it in.

235
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,434
[ZENNY laughing]

236
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,535
[ZENNY]
I've lived many years,

237
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,071
but I've never met pirates
as interesting as you!

238
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,539
I love you kids.

239
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,042
Let's have a party
tonight and celebrate!

240
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,044
[LUFFY]
Ah, yeah, let's celebrate!

241
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,712
Getting our ship back!

242
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:44,116
[GROUP laughing]

243
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,725
Gramps, you really
are just like a pirate.

244
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,327
You sure drink like one!

245
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,728
[ZENNY laughs]

246
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,497
Nami, do you think
that I'm a pirate?

247
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,266
Well, it would explain
why you can afford

248
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,568
to have such exquisite
glassware, right?

249
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,071
It does look like it's
from a treasure trove.

250
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,239
I see, you're trying
to get the old man drunk

251
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,508
so you can make him tell you
where he keeps the treasure,

252
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,309
is that it?

253
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,844
Well, don't spell
it out for him!

254
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,181
So goat man, do you have
a hidden treasure, huh?

255
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,651
Didn't I just ask you guys
to keep your mouths shut?

256
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,587
At least you could have a little
respect for the process!

257
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,822
You really wanna know?

258
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,090
[NAMI]
Mm‐hmm.

259
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:29,695
My treasure is what I've shared
all my joys and sorrows with.

260
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,863
My beloved goats.

261
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,598
[GOATS bleat]

262
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,667
What a beautiful story.

263
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,868
Ha! Gotcha!

264
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,770
Ha ha!

265
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,372
Oh, come on, Gramps.

266
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,606
Please tell me.

267
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,842
Okay, you asked for it.

268
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,677
Of all the great pirates who
have sailed the Grand Line,

269
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,379
I was known as...

270
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:47,380
I knew it!

271
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,481
[LUFFY, USOPP]
Hm?

272
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,283
The only moneylender who
would do business with them!

273
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,351
Moneylender?

274
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,788
I'm Zenny the Moneylender,
not Zenny the Pirate.

275
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,489
You are?

276
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,557
Well that's too bad, huh, Nami?

277
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,326
He may not be an actual pirate,

278
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,794
but it must've
taken a lot of brass

279
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,163
to lend money to them,
right, old man?

280
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:04,897
Why's that?

281
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,032
Hey, use your head!

282
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,401
Do you think most pirates
are gonna take out a loan

283
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,302
and then pay it back
with a smile?

284
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,804
Not to mention all the interest!

285
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,572
Your friend is right.

286
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,175
Every one of those seafaring
serpents tried to bilk me

287
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,176
out of my money.

288
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,244
They all broke their words,

289
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,413
went back on their contracts,
and did their best

290
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:23,182
to betray me when it
finally came time to collect.

291
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,550
Wow, Gramps, I guess it's true

292
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,752
that you really do
hate pirates, huh?

293
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,688
If I'd just sat back
and taken it from them,

294
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,657
my business would've been
wiped out in no time at all.

295
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,496
Every time I went out
to collect a debt.

296
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,900
I had to fight against pirates
at the risk of my own life.

297
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,773
So in order to stay in business,

298
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,675
you'd have to be stronger
than any of them,

299
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,543
wouldn't you?

300
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,845
Were you that strong,
old goat man?

301
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,214
Hell no, I was
weaker than a kitten,

302
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,250
but back in those days,
I had a dream.

303
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,351
[LUFFY]
A dream?

304
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,391
[NAMI]
You did?

305
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,145
[PIRATE CAPTAIN]
What?

306
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,347
Pay back the money?

307
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,049
Right, 'cause I'm
Zenny the Moneylender,

308
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,417
not Zenny the Money Giver!

309
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,552
I'd sooner see you and
your crew frying in hell

310
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,554
than let you skip out
on your debt!

311
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,423
Now what's it gonna be?

312
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,259
N‐Now hold on, Zenny! Here!

313
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,195
Well, how's tricks
with you? Heh.

314
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,330
Not so fast!

315
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,332
You think we'll just give up?

316
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,733
Nah, of course not!

317
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:54,006
[PIRATES yelling]

318
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,675
Zenny! You're dead! Y'hear?

319
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,678
[ZENNY] Hee hee!
Nice doing business with you!

320
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,182
I may have been weak,
but I had a dream to fight for.

321
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,518
Fight for it I did,
no matter what the risk!

322
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,219
What was your dream, exactly?

323
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,021
Ever since I was
just a little kid,

324
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,422
I wanted to be a pirate!

325
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,526
A real pirate!
The king of pirates!

326
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,395
That's why I first got started
in the moneylending business.

327
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,530
[GROUP]
Hm?

328
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,565
But instead of
realizing my dream,

329
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,700
I end up getting ambushed
by a bunch of pirates

330
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,203
out for revenge and marooned
on this deserted island,

331
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,738
fighting for my survival.

332
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,107
That was 20 years ago.

333
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,276
Are you telling me that you've
been making your grave

334
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,377
that whole 20 years?

335
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,113
At first, I planned to
build the ship near the sea,

336
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,282
but I realized rather quickly
that hauling the lumber

337
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,551
down from the mountain
was too much.

338
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,720
But I wasn't going to give up
over a little thing like that.

339
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,123
Instead I built it
in the mountains.

340
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,225
It was going to be
a great adventure.

341
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,228
But somewhere along
the way I wised up.

342
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,730
Before I knew it,
I was too old to set sail

343
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,733
for the Grand Line.

344
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:58,304
It's funny the way time can
sneak up on you like that.

345
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,073
So much for my dreams
of being a pirate.

346
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,677
Well. Dreams are just dreams.

347
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,280

348
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,851
I don't understand
why you gave up, goat man.

349
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,253
Age doesn't have
anything to do with it.

350
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,488
If you wanna be a pirate,
you should just do it.

351
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,292
Now hold on,
what are we gonna do

352
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,428
if he starts taking
you seriously?

353
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,330
Remember a pirate needs a ship,

354
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,599
and this guy's ship is a coffin
that's sitting halfway up

355
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,600
the side of a mountain!

356
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,468
Then all we have to
do is haul it down, right?

357
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,104
Don't say that like
it's gonna be easy!

358
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,506
[ZENNY]
That's true, there's still time!

359
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,142
I warned you,
he's taking it seriously!

360
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,444
Nonsense!

361
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,613
He's just a little bit drunk,
aren't you?

362
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,781
That's right, yeah,
I'm drunk, honey!

363
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,550
[laughing]

364
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,784
Really?

365
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,387
[ZENNY] This straw‐hatted kid's
got me absolutely intoxicated,

366
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,688
and not just with wine!

367
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,290
So here's looking
forward to the day

368
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,626
when the Zenny pirates
finally set sail!

369
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,794
[GROUP cheering]

370
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,533
[CORPORAL]
Can we really do this?

371
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,337
Lure the Straw Hat pirates off
the island all by ourselves?

372
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,840
[MINCHY]
They're just a bunch of kids.

373
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,375
As long as we don't
lose our heads,

374
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,543
we have nothing
to fear from them.

375
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,812
It's not like I'm gonna
fight them myself.

376
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,180
Now calm down.

377
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,715
But is the captain
really going to be able

378
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,417
to take the Straw Hat Pirates?

379
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,819
I don't really much
care one way or another.

380
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,188
While the big boys are
off fighting for justice,

381
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,858
we're just gonna be walking
off with a bunch of treasure.

382
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,827
And you needn't worry, Corporal,
I won't forget about you.

383
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,362
You'll be taken care of.

384
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,664
Uh, thanks.

385
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,532
[MINCHY chuckles]

386
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,611
[ZENNY] Age doesn't have
anything to do with it, huh?

387
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,346
He had to go and
say something to start

388
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,882
an old man dreaming
again, didn't he?

389
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,552
That straw‐hatted kid
sure is a sneaky son of a gun.

390
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,853
[laughs]

391
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,689
I agree.

392
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,790
Oh, hi.

393
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,693
[ROBIN] Our captain also
rescues people who want to die

394
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,862
without asking them,
and then lets them live.

395
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,864
And are you sorry
he let you live?

396
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,934
Don't know, it may be
too soon for me to tell.

397
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,204
No, you're not sorry.

398
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,272
You may not know it yet,

399
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,607
but I can tell by looking
at you that your life

400
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,777
is just getting started.

401
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,814
But in my case,
my dream's going to lie

402
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,582
buried here, forever.

403
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,225
[GOATS bleat]

404
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,460
[ZENNY]
What do you see?

405
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,428
[CHOPPER]
Emergency! Wake up!

406
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,433
I slept good. What's to eat?

407
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,602
The Marines!
The Marines are here, guys!

408
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,770
What's that?

409
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,076
[USOPP]
Just one ship?

410
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,445
[NAMI] They don't look like
they're about to attack, either.

411
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,281
Then what is it doing here?

412
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,484
[MINCHY]
Straw Hat Pirates, greetings!

413
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
I'm Sergeant Minchy
of the Marine Corps,

414
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,487
it's a pleasure!

415
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,688
[NAMI]
I bet it is.

416
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,457
[MINCHY] Hey, I'm really sorry
about the other day, okay?

417
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,760
Forgive us. If we'd had a
better idea of who you were,

418
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,429
we wouldn't have spent
all day chasing after you!

419
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,997
Please accept our apology.

420
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,632
Maybe I'm just paranoid,

421
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,501
but I always thought
the Marines were supposed

422
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,769
to chase pirates.

423
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,438
It's like he's campaigning for
the Miss Congeniality Award.

424
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,606
Stay sharp.

425
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,441
[MINCHY]
Now hold on! Let's not be hasty!

426
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,610
We know all about how
you guys defeated Crocodile

427
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,345
back in Alabasta, okay?

428
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,946
The last thing we want
to do is go up against

429
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,283
pirates as great as you guys
are without any back‐up!

430
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,217
Think about it!

431
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,819
I'd have to be dumb
as a bag of hammers

432
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,821
to come with just
one ship if I was planning

433
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,855
to take you on!

434
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,390
Well, what do you think of that?

435
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,626
Huh. This Marine's
actually afraid of us!

436
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,894
[laughing]

437
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,797
Assuming we were foolish enough
to risk our lives fighting you,

438
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,899
we wouldn't be earning
any money on the deal!

439
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,801
So then what are you doing here?

440
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,802
[MINCHY]
Oh, well, you know how it is,

441
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,371
this is a newly discovered,
uncharted island.

442
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,640
We're just here to,
uh, investigate it.

443
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,974
[NAMI]
What's to investigate?

444
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,343
There's just an old man
and his goats.

445
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,979
Hey, guys, where did
the old man get to?

446
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,147
A‐ha!

447
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,050
So Zenny is being taken good
care of here then, is he?

448
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
[NAMI]
Zenny?

449
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,753
[MINCHY]
Once our survey is done,

450
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,089
we're planning on
returning to our base.

451
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,724
I don't want to be pushy,
but I suggest you set sail

452
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,693
out of here as soon as possible.

453
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,728
No one would blame you,
considering what a frenzy

454
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,565
Marine headquarters
is in to eliminate you all.

455
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,499
He's got a point.

456
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,868
We should get away
now while we still can.

457
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,736
I'll go grab the supplies.

458
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,705
Gotta call Robin too.

459
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,316
Look there!

460
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,819
[ZENNY] It's a trap!
A dirty Marine trick!

461
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,824
[SANJI]
So what should we do, set sail?

462
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,994
[MINCHY] The weather's really
good when you get past the fog.

463
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,496
Gentle waves, a steady breeze,

464
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,532
and we won't lay so much as
a finger on you, I swear it.

465
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,501
I'll go when I'm good and ready!

466
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,536
You're not the boss of me!

467
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,104
Y'know, if I were a Marine,

468
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,073
I'd be fighting against
us no matter what

469
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,441
the odds were against me!

470
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,343
And there's another
thing that's strange!

471
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,378
How did you happen to
know his name was Zenny?

472
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,181
We didn't say a word about it,
but you came right out with it

473
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,516
like you knew he was here!

474
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,750
[MINCHY]
I was just...

475
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,353
And I'm getting just a tad bit
suspicious of this "survey"

476
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,021
you're planning to conduct!

477
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,424
You're not after Gramps's
treasure, now, are you?

478
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,126
That's it, right?

479
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,129
Don't trust this guy. He lies!

480
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,397
[MINCHY] Well, so much
for the innocent routine!

481
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,966
She sounds like she knows all
about the mountain of treasure

482
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,935
Zenny the Moneylender
received in order to settle

483
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,103
the pirates' debts!

484
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,137
[GROUP gasps]

485
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,305
[NAMI]
I just knew it!

486
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,940
See! There is a treasure!

487
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,442
I smell gunpowder!

488
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,211
Are his ship's cannons loaded?

489
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,413
Maybe. It's from
more than one ship.

490
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,382
It's from more ships
than I can count!

491
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,550
[NAMI]
What's that? Look!

492
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,219
[SANJI] If we'd set sail like
our friend here advised,

493
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,955
we'd have been caught in
a sneak attack by that fleet!

494
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,123
[ZORO]
That does it!

495
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,126
Just come and get me!

496
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,394
Wait! Please wait!

497
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,996
[USOPP whines]
Luffy!

498
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,231
Usopp, no!

499
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,566
Help me!

500
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,601
No one move,
not even one little twitch,

501
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,970
or the big‐nosed one gets it!

502
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,672
So they already had
a landing party in place

503
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,173
waiting for us, did they?

504
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,977
Excellent work,
Corporal, nice timing!

505
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,079
[ZENNY] Hurry up and take
a warning to them, guys!

506
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,281
[ROBIN] It's too late, they'll
never make it down in time!

507
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,417
But what other
alternatives do we have?

508
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,486
At this rate your fellow
crewmembers are done for.

509
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,523
This whole thing
stinks like dead fish.

510
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,024
What'll we do?

511
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,260
You're a pirate, old man,
think of something.

512
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,027
Come on!

513
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,529
Yeah, great,
maybe I am a pirate,

514
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,331
but this ship is my coffin.

515
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,132
It's stuck in the mountains.

516
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,436
And me... I wouldn't know
which way to sail.

517
