00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,596
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,781
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:25,950
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,380
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:42,384
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,095
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:47,389
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:52,644
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,521
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:59,442
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:01,486
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:07,242
<i>Every tear that we've cried</i>
<i>only helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:14,290
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:21,798
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,552
[WARRIOR A]
Another warrior has died.

25
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,263
[WARRIOR B] And there was
that terrible earthquake.

26
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:36,688
[WARRIOR C]
You are the evil spirits!

27
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:39,065
Now we will punish you!

28
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,483
[SAILOR Z]
This wasn't the agreement!

29
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,694
--[SAILOR AA] Look out!
--[SAILOR Z, SAILER BB] Stop!

30
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,326
[WARRIOR C]
Seto! Move aside!

31
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,494
[WARRIOR D]
What's the meaning of this?

32
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:52,746
[SETO]
This is pathetic.

33
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,332
The Shandoran warriors
I know and look up to...

34
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,586
They show a lot more
pride than you do.

35
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,629
Kid...

36
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:06,134
[LUFFY] "Free from the Spell!
The Great Warrior Sheds Tears!"

37
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,640
[KALGARA]
It won't be long now.

38
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:15,602
You should prepare yourself
for when the sun sets.

39
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,315
That's when the
lives of your men...

40
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:21,649
...will be an offering...

41
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,151
...unto the gods.

42
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:31,201
[grunting]

43
00:03:31,284 --> 00:03:32,285
Dammit!

44
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,247
[KALGARA chuckles]

45
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:37,582
My...

46
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:40,585
The earth certainly did
swallow you up skillfully.

47
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,754
It was truly an act of god!

48
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:45,965
The fact that you're still alive
is what's hardest to believe!

49
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:51,346
[NOLAND yelling]

50
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:52,555
[KALGARA]
Hm?

51
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,061
[KALGARA]
The ground!

52
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,480
[NOLAND grunts]

53
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:10,740
[NOLAND yelling]

54
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:14,786
[CLERIC]
Prepare for the ceremony!

55
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:17,539
Bring every sacrifice
to the altar!

56
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,082
[SAILOR CC]
Please, wait a little longer!

57
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:21,292
[SAILOR DD] The commodore'll
be back in a few more hours!

58
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:22,919
Give us more time! Please!

59
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,671
[SAILOR EE]
Why are they doing this to us?

60
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,633
[KALGARA]
The sun is setting.

61
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:31,011
The ceremony must
be starting soon.

62
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,973
[NOLAND panting]

63
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:36,641
[KALGARA]
How disgusting.

64
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:40,311
Is this the wreck of a man
who defied the gods?

65
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:43,523
[NOLAND] What exactly
are you so afraid of?

66
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:44,607
Afraid?

67
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,526
[NOLAND]
You fear what you do not know!

68
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:50,405
And you trade innocent people's
lives for false consolations!

69
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,615
[KALGARA]
What are you saying?

70
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,159
Sacrifices...

71
00:04:54,242 --> 00:04:55,952
...are pointless deaths!

72
00:04:56,036 --> 00:04:58,121
[KALGARA growling]

73
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,247
[NOLAND grunts]

74
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,795
[KALGARA] We have lived
this way for centuries!

75
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,631
[NOLAND]
That doesn't make it right!

76
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,091
[KALGARA]
Silence!

77
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,594
You don't know what
you're talking about!

78
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:14,804
[NOLAND] The lives of your
citizens are more precious

79
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:16,264
than gods.

80
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,474
[grunts]

81
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,560
They're real people!

82
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,146
[tribal drums]

83
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,732
[CLERIC] Take the
sacrifices to the altar!

84
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:29,152
Burn them at the stake and
send them to the Heavens!

85
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,115
[SAILORS yelling]

86
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,159
[SAILOR AA] Commodore!
Don't let them burn us!

87
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:40,663
[SAILORS yelling]

88
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:45,377
[NOLAND] You can send an
innocent girl to her death.

89
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,631
And have no remorse, so I doubt
you'd understand, but try.

90
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:51,841
What you're doing
is less than human!

91
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:53,301
Don't you see that?

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,598
[KALGARA]
No remorse, you say.

93
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,560
The innocent girl you speak of.

94
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,940
She was my daughter!

95
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,527
What?

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,571
You would tell your own
daughter to give up her life?

97
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:16,282
You're very wrong.
And you don't understand.

98
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,993
There is so much power
in the words of our gods.

99
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,788
And the people must obey.

100
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:24,499
The gods will not
hear our pleas!

101
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,836
Even if we ask them
to spare our children.

102
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,299
[SOUTHBIRDS call]

103
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,761
[KALGARA]
It's smaller than the last one.

104
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:39,806
It must be one of
Kashi's children!

105
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,893
The gods' blood has come
to pass judgment on you!

106
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:46,187
[NOLAND]
Judgment my ass!

107
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,565
[SNAKE hissing]

108
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:49,899
[NOLAND]
Let me explain.

109
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,359
Tree Fever is a plague.

110
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,778
A plague that wiped out
hundreds of thousands of lives

111
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,948
in my own village years ago
and now it is ravaging yours.

112
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,116
But it's gone.

113
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,076
No one's died in decades

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,788
as a result of this
awful disease. No one!

115
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,708
And do you know why?

116
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,502
Because we discovered
a cure for it!

117
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm holding in my hand
bark from the Cona tree.

118
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:16,718
This is the cure!

119
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,637
I only need to extract
the Conine from it!

120
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,681
If I can bring this
back to your people,

121
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,434
I can save all of their lives!

122
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:30,106
But you insist on
keeping countless masses

123
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,399
from their cure.

124
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,568
Do you realize how
many innocent victims

125
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,820
have already perished
because of you?

126
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,948
So I stand by what I said.

127
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:42,243
Your ceremonies are
an insult to my people.

128
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,496
You're too busy
blindly trampling over

129
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,624
great advancements to see how
much it could benefit you!

130
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,210
[SNAKE hisses]

131
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:53,963
I may die in judgment,
or I may die in an accident.

132
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,299
At least I'll stay
true to my people.

133
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,885
How will your village die,
by ignorance?

134
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,721
Is the pain you cause
your people worth it

135
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,640
to be true to your Gods?

136
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,684
[SNAKE hisses]

137
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:09,562
This is a man who
speaks earnest words.

138
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,147
I recognize that.

139
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:15,860
[KALGARA]
Answer this.

140
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,323
What is this thing?

141
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,866
What have I killed?

142
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,330
--[NOLAND] A snake.
--[KALGARA] No!

143
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,832
You're wrong!

144
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:32,293
I just broke one
of our commandments!

145
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,797
I just killed a precious god!

146
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,967
A god! Do you understand me?

147
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,890
But all you can see is a snake!

148
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:49,227
And you see our deadly curse
as some curable disease!

149
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,604
Tell me!
Can you save our village?

150
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:54,691
[NOLAND]
I can.

151
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:57,921
[SAILORS laughing, chattering]

152
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,348
[BABY SNAKE hisses]

153
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,516
[SAILOR FF]
A snake!

154
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,268
Wait just a minute.

155
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:14,521
Hey! Kalgara! Look at this!

156
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,272
[BABY SNAKE hisses]

157
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,524
What a shock.

158
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,819
I didn't realize that
snake had a grandchild.

159
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,321
"That snake," huh?

160
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,781
[laughs]

161
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,199
A snake!

162

[laughing]

163
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:28,952
[SAILORS]
Huh?

164
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,371
[SAILOR II]
Would you look at that?

165
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,248
It doesn't make any sense.

166
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:34,749
[SAILOR JJ] Those two were
trying' to kill each other

167
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,084
not too long ago.

168
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,211
Now they're laughing
together like good friends.

169
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:39,963
[WARRIOR E] Usually Kalgara
isn't very friendly

170
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,423
with the villagers either.

171

[laughing continues]

172
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,802
[WARRIOR E] I've never seen
him smile like that before.

173

[KALGARA]
All right, follow me.

174
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,434
[KALGARA]
We climb down here.

Climb down?

00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,063
[bell rings]

177
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,568
[KALGARA chuckles]

178
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:04,112
[bell rings]

179
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:08,324
That... ringing.

180
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:09,534
Kalgara.

181
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,287
Where is that beautiful
ringing coming from?

182
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,289
[KALGARA]
Follow me and I will show you.

183
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:17,417
[bell rings]

184
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:21,755
[SOUTHBIRDS call]

185
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,923
[ringing continues]

186
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,678
Ah...!

187
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,514
[SAILORS]
Ah...!

188
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,308
[ringing continues]

189
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,544
They're here!

190
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,006
[KALGARA] You're speechless.
I'm not surprised.

191
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,633
This is Shandora.

192
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:09,344
And we're the survivors
of this golden city.

193
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:12,389
[NOLAND]
A city of gold.

194
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:14,307
It's like I'm dreaming!

195
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:33,368
It's a city... full of treasure!

196
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,495
There's gold everywhere!

197
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:36,663
[cheering]

198
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,706
[NOLAND]
Hey!

199
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,417
Wait! Everyone stop!

200
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,710
[KALGARA]
It's all right.

201
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,295
Load up your ship with
all the treasure you can.

202
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,631
Just leave the golden bell.

203
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,425
[SAILORS]
Huh?

204
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:49,843
Seto!

205
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:52,887
Show these sailors where
they can find the treasure.

206
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:53,888
Right!

207
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,307
Kalgara, are you sure?

208
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:59,102
All the villagers here
agree that this is right.

209
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:00,270
It is a gift.

210
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:01,896
We want to thank you
for saving our tribe

211
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,940
from that terrible disease.

212
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,109
--This is nothing at all.
--[SAILORS yell]

213
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,777
[SAILOR LL] You're so
generous, Great Warrior!

214
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,529
[NOLAND]
But... I don't understand.

215
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:12,574
Haven't your people been working
hard to protect this city?

216
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:13,700
That's true.

217
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:16,244
We have worked
hard to protect it.

218
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:17,746
Although...

219
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,749
It's not necessarily
the treasure we guard.

220
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,500
Come!

221
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,877
Let me show you.

222
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,505
[SAILORS]
Ah...!

223
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,093
[cheering]

224
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,596
[KALGARA] The only thing
we guard is this stone.

225
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,680
[NOLAND]
Ah.

226
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,058
Look at that writing.

227
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,894
What's it mean?

228
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,312
[KALGARA]
We don't know.

229
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:48,068
It is a Poneglyph: writings
left over from ancient history.

230
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,903
[NOLAND] You mean this isn't
something that was written

231
00:13:49,986 --> 00:13:51,321
by your ancestors?

232
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,659
There is only one
thing we know for sure.

233
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,162
That the city of Shandora
fought and fell trying

234
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,540
to protect this stone,
and we will, too.

235
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:07,420
As descendants, we feel
it is our duty to continue

236
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:10,131
to protect it with
the same resolve.

237
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,259
This stone now represents
proof that our ancestors

238
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:17,972
not only fought a
vicious fight, but survived.

239
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:21,351
And we revere our ancestors
as we would our gods.

240
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,479
Still, when I heard
the bell ringing before,

241
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,065
I had no idea it
would be this huge.

242
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,320
[KALGARA] The bell's rings
have words to them.

243
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,738
[NOLAND]
Words?

244
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:34,989
[KALGARA]
Yes.

245
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,242
It speaks so that the
spirits of our ancestors

246
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:40,036
who have passed can
still return to this land

247
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,289
at any time
without getting lost.

248
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:46,167
We continue to ring the bell
as if to shout to them,

249
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:50,964
"We are here!" "Come home!"
"We are waiting for you!"

250
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,340
And the sound.

251
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:56,177
The sound itself proclaims
the glory of Shandora.

252
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:59,723
Making its existence known
to the ends of the sea!

253
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:03,727
It shouts:
"We will never run or hide!"

254
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,604
Because of this, we have
given the grand bell a name.

255
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,357
We call it the
"Fire of Shandora."

256
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,650
Makes sense.

257
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,986
That explains
the majestic sound!

258
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,029
You think so?

259
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,113
Yeah!

260
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,701
It was this fire
that reached out to us

261
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,370
and helped us arrive here.

262
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:26,499
I heard the ringing
during a terrible storm.

263
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,085
I heard it clearly when it
shouldn't have been audible

264
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:30,253
at all.

265
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:34,382
[BABY SNAKE hisses]

266
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,676
You like the bell's ringing too?

267
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,303
Yeah, I bet you do.

268
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,139
I bet someday,
you'll grow up just like

269
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,808
that other giant snake.

270
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,810

[KALGARA laughs]

272
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,357
But probably not for
another hundred years!

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,068
[ALL laughing]

274
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,528
[KALGARA] Noland,
I invite you to stay here.

275
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:56,696
Please.

276
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,407
It's been 400 years
since Shandora fell.

277
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,950
And you're the first
guests we've had,

278
00:16:01,034 --> 00:16:02,577
so I want to welcome you.

279
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,412
Won't you accept my offer?

280
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:07,665
[NOLAND]
Thank you, Kalgara.

281
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,001
And with your permission I
would also love the opportunity

282
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,795
to collect some
plants from the forest

283
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,755
and see this plague
all the way through.

284
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:14,923
[SAILOR OO]
Commodore!

285
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,758
Commodore!

286
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,009
[NOLAND]
Hold on, now.

287
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:19,177
What's with the clothes?

288
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,762
[SAILOR LL]
We found an Eternal Compass!

289
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:22,222
[SAILOR OO]
And look at this map, Commodore!

290
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,848
Just look!

291
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:27,769
[KALGARA] We took these items
from those who intruded upon us.

292
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:31,189
[SAILOR OO]
Is that a map of this island?

293
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,399
[KALGARA]
Yes.

294
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:35,151
That skull shape is
definitely our island.

295
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:39,155
The name "Shandora" means
"the skull's right eye."

296
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,533
The name refers to
the city's location.

297
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,784
Right here.

298
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,578
[door opens]

299
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,539
[DOCTOR]
Well, take care!

300
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:50,083
And make sure she
gets plenty of rest, okay?

301
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,252
I will, thanks! G'bye doctor!

302
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,172
[VILLAGER A]
Hey, look, everyone!

303
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:58,216
Noland brought us
some exotic crops!

304
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,637
[NOLAND] I have a greenhouse
on our ship with all kinds

305
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,097
of plant samples.

306
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,391
I'll leave some seeds and
sprouts here that are suited

307
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:07,726
for your soil.

308
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:10,395
Does it taste good?

309
00:17:10,478 --> 00:17:11,312
[NOLAND]
Very!

310
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,981
And it's full of nutrients!

311
00:17:15,483 --> 00:17:20,488

[SAILOR JJ]
All right!

316
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,671
Time to begin another
day of hard work!

317
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,172
[SAILOR II]
Hard work doing what?

318
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,715
Having a campfire party?

319
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,885
[SAILORS laughing]

320
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:31,101
But why?

321
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:34,062
Why would the doctor
and the others do this?

322
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,356
[crying]

323
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:39,859
[WARRIOR A]
Chief!

324
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:41,277
Noland and the
others are coming!

325
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:44,948
[ELDER] You are not to say
anything about last night!

326
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:46,282
Is that clear?

327
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:49,244
They said they are going
to set sail in a few days.

328
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,539
So until then,
don't do anything rash.

329
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:54,040
Do you hear me?

330
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,501
Fine, then. Our people will
never understand each other.

331
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,420
They've only done harm.

332
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,338
[WARRIOR G] I don't care
how good his medicine is.

333
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:01,881
He's still a god killer!

334
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,218
Do these people think
they can just show up here

335
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:06,803
and stomp all over our history?

336
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,179
They'll pay!

337
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,973
Silence!

338
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:15,020
We must endure it, and we must
wait quietly for them to leave.

339
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,146
[WARRIOR I]
They're here!

340
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,400
Hello, everyone.

341
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,277
I'm looking for Kalgara.

342
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,699
[doors closing]

343
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,246
[NOLAND] Why is everyone
acting so cold all of a sudden?

344
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,123
And where's Kalgara?

345
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:38,001
Turn around and leave now.
You're not welcome.

346
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,544
You're outsiders.

347
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,463
Kalgara doesn't want
to see you anymore.

348
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,089
Seto, stop!

349
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,303
When are you going
to leave, anyway?

350
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:49,596
Answer me!

351
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:53,224
[SAILOR II]
What's going on?

352
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,185
It seems like they
suddenly hate us.

353
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:57,604
Now, hold on!

354
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,314
You can't just start
acting like this!

355
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,815
It's not fair!

356
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:01,983
Let it go.

357
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:05,445
[NOLAND]
Let's continue our work.

358
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,783
We still have some
forest to inspect.

359
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,870
[WARRIOR F]
There you are, Kalgara!

360
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:15,997
Noland has been looking for you!

361
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,332
[KALGARA]
I know he has.

362
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,960
I have no desire
to speak to him.

363
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:25,757
If I see him right now,
I'm afraid I might kill him.

364
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,343
[KALGARA growls]

365
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:32,889
[SAILOR GG]
That's strange.

366
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,474
The bell didn't ring today.

367
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:35,809
[SAILOR HH]
Yeah.

368
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:36,976
It's the first time that's
happened in the month

369
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,269
that we've been here.

370
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,648
[DOCTOR]
Commodore?

371
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,651
[NOLAND] I'll be done exploring
the forest in two days.

372
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,111
Uh... Right.

373
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,905
[NOLAND] Let everyone know
we set sail in three days.

374
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:51,658
Tell them that this is their
last chance to enjoy dry land

375
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:52,992
for awhile.

376
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:57,831
Commodore,
to tell you the truth,

377
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:00,166
I can't wait to get
off this insane island.

378
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,836
Only after we've
finished our duties.

379
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,045
Goodnight.

380
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,966
[KALGARA]
You should stay here, Noland!

381
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,300
I have an idea!

382
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,219
Why don't you make
Mousse your wife?

383
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,429
[KALGARA, NOLAND laugh]

384
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:13,763
[NOLAND]
Don't be silly!

385
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:16,683
I have a family at home
and kids who are her age!

386
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,269
You're outsiders.

387
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:22,439
Kalgara doesn't want
to see you anymore.

388
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:24,691
When are you going
to leave, anyway?

389
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:25,984
Answer me!

390
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,582
[NOLAND]
I know you're here, Kalgara!

391
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,667
Come out, now!

392
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,252
I won't understand
what's going on

393
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,129
unless you talk to me!

394
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,714
This is ridiculous!

395
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,257
Not to mention unfair!

396
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,300
Hey!

397
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:53,053
Come on!
We set sail in a few days!

398
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,055
I don't want us
to part like this!

399
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,309
[NOLAND grunts]

400
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,988
[KALGARA] How dare you
show your face here!

401
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:14,866
Do you want your wife
to live her life as a widow?

402
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:18,036
[KALGARA grunts]

403
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:20,497
Kalgara!

404
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:31,716
<i>When you're lost and alone,</i>
<i>I can always hear your voice</i>

405
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,888
<i>While you wander far from home,</i>
<i>gazing up at the sky</i>

406
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>You are just like the moon</i>

407
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,437
<i>You never change as</i>
<i>you climb into the night</i>

408
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:52,904
<i>But your reflection wanes,</i>
<i>then you disappear,</i>

409
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:56,908
<i>fading so suddenly...</i>

410
00:22:56,991 --> 00:23:02,163
<i>Stay as you are,</i>
<i>don't lose your way</i>

411
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:11,089
<i>Let these words guide you,</i>
<i>don't ever look back!</i>

412
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

413
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

414
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

415
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

416
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

417
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,581
[KALGARA] The bell has
lost all its meaning!

418
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:45,915
[NOLAND]
I don't understand.

419
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,584
I only did what I had to!

420
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,419
[KALGARA] If these were
sacrifices for your

421
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,838
advancements, we should
have never accepted you!

422
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,423
[NOLAND] They have
every right to be angry

423
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,508
and we have no
reason to be forgiven.

424
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,552
We're returning to
the Lvneel Kingdom!

425
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:59,179
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

426
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,430
"Eternal Friends!

427
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:03,475
The Vowed Bell Echoes
Across the Mighty Seas!"

428
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:06,102
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
