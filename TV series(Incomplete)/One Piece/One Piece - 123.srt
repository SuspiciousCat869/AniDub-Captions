Do you remember the terms
of that agreement?

I was to bring you to the

233
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,423
you would hand over the
information on the weapon to me.

at all about Pluton.

of our partnership,

something as foolish as that.

I can tell from Cobra's reaction

that Pluton really does exist.

You see, this underground
temple was built

so that disturbing
just one small column

of the entire structure

There can't be many places

<i>a map of perfection</i>

345
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,575
<i>I secretly held in</i>

346
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,344
<i>the depths of my heart!</i>

347
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,246
<i>I aim for sky air</i>
<i>and follow my dreams there</i>

348
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,350
<i>although, there were times</i>
<i>I was lost and lonely</i>

349
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,651
<i>I know it's real too,</i>

350
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
<i>because when I met you,</i>

351
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,089
<i>you brought out the</i>
<i>finest me I could be</i>

352
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,025
<i>And when I overcame my fear,</i>

353
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>I gained something</i>
<i>so wonderful here</i>

354
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:49,368
<i>Now the time is at hand for my</i>
<i>wish to be turned to a pledge!</i>

355
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,237
<i>Shining Ray!</i>
<i>Find your brand‐new way!</i>

356
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,274
<i>We'll sketch out a tale of all</i>
<i>the stories yet to be told!</i>

357
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,277
<i>I fill the sails with all</i>
<i>that I'm feeling now</i>

358
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,346
<i>See how the winds are changing!♪</i>

359
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,383
<i>Shining Ray!</i>
<i>Find your brand‐new way!</i>

360
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,319
<i>A never‐ending journey</i>
<i>to be together!</i>

361
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:11,123
<i>I'm gonna go wherever you</i>
<i>go, my Shining Ray!</i>

362
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,364
[LUFFY]
I've got you cornered now!

363
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,600
[CROCODILE] Straw Hat!
How are you still alive?

364
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,368
How many times do
I have to kill you?

365
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,404
[USOPP] What? That's really
where the cannoneer is?

366
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,505
Are you sure?

367
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,606
[VIVI] Yes! That's the only
place I can think of.

368
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,474
[USOPP] Then we'll leave
a message for the others.

369
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,609
[VIVI]
I'm going on ahead.

370
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,577
[USOPP]
What? Hey, Vivi, wait for me!

371
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,346
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

372
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,047
"The Nightmare Draws Near!

373
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,717
This is the Sand‐Sand
Clan's Secret Base."

374
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,353
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
