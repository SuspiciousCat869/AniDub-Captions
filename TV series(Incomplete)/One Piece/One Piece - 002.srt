[RIKA]
No!

177
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,607
Sorry about this.
Try curling up into a ball.

[LUFFY grunts]

182
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,818
Thanks, mister!

183
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,454
[COBY]
Luffy! Are you two okay?!

184
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,655
What about you, little girl?

185
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,622
Are you all right?

186
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,125
I can't believe how
wretched a person he is.

187
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,793
Now where are you
hurt? Anywhere?

188
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,627
Damn you.

189
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,796

[HELMEPPO snorts, laughs]

191
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,635
You're just dead set on
staying alive, aren't you?

192
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,837
That's right.

193
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,638
And I'm gonna make it through
the month without any problems.

194
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,507
Right... Good luck with that.

195
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,710
[HELMEPPO laughing]

196
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,645
Only ten days left.

197
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,980
[HELMEPPO] Oh, you still
assume you'll make it

198
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,648
to the end of those ten days.

199
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,150
[HELMEPPO laughing]

How can that man be so cruel?

201
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,987
Luffy?

202
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,857
Uh! What the‐‐?
Where did he go?!

203
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,191
[ZORO gasps]

204
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,527
[LUFFY]
So, I hear you're a bad guy.

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,862
[ZORO]
Are you still here?

206
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,829
[LUFFY]
You're stuck out here

207
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,831
for all the world
to see and nothing.

208
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,066
Are you really all that strong?

209
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,567
[ZORO]
Mind your own business!

210
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,902
[LUFFY sighs]

211
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,507
If I were you, I'd probably
starve to death in three days.

212
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,543
[ZORO] I've got more spirit
than you could ever have,

213
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,013
which is how I'm gonna
survive this ordeal.

214
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,015
This I swear.

215
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,050
Hah, what a weirdo!

216
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,519
Wait, hold on.

217
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,189
Could you... pick
that up for me?

218
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,025
You're gonna eat this?

219
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,027
'Cause it's mostly
a ball of mud.

220
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,929
Shut up and give it to me, now!

221
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,030
[LUFFY]
Uh...

222
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,102
[ZORO coughing]

223
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,870
Should've listened to me.

224
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,939
[ZORO]
It was good.

225
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,874
Thanks for the food.

226
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,945
[RIKA]
Really?

227
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,879
That's right!

228
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,715
He ate every last
grain of rice there was.

229
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,050
That's great!

230
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
I wonder if Zoro
was really as evil

231
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,720
as everyone
thinks that he is.

232
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,556
He's not!

233
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,558
He's good... because...

234
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,059
He got himself punished...

235
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:20,893
...for us.

236
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,563
You're, uh... You're
making no sense.

237
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,564
Sorry...

238
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,266
It's that dumb Helmeppo.

239
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,902
He's the son of Captain Morgan.

240
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,972
[HELMEPPO]
Step aside! Step aside!

241
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,575
Make way for my
beautiful pet doggy!

242
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,244
Anyone who doesn't move,
I'll have executed!

You, little girl!

249
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,590
Is there some kind of problem

250
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,792
with how my beloved
dog is behaving?

251
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,093
Rika, put it down!

252
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,795

get us in trouble.

Wait! You're him... It's you!

You're the Pirate Hunter Zoro!

[ZORO]
And if I am?

261
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,317
What is a pirate hunter doing
defying the Marines, huh?!

262
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,953
[ZORO] Can it, and let me
finish my meal in peace.

on my nerves, pal.

mutt of yours.

You do realize...

273
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,314
...if my dad finds
out about this...

274
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,684
...he'll surely execute
the girl and her mother.

275
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,721
Ha, ha. So what do you say
to a little deal between men?

276
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,825
In place of the kid and her mom,
we string you up instead...

277
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,228
...for, uh, say one month!

278
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,829
You survive that one month,

279
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,699
and I'll be so nice
as to let you live, too.

Sound fair?

282
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,239
Then one month it is.

00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:20,046
[RIKA] It's been three
weeks since that day.

284

kicking him while he's tied up.

He's being so unfair!

I don't...

287
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,020

293
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,865
And bring me a bottle
of your finest moonshine

or whatever crap you serve.

295
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,370
And put some speed to it,
lady; I don't have all day.

296

Oh... That's more like it.

297
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,374
I'm trying to think of
something interesting to do

298
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,043
seeing as how I'm bored
out of my skull here.

299
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,045

Luffy, no!

304
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,092
You can't hit him!

305
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,793
This guy is scum!

306
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,895
You actually hit me!

307
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,298

son, you know!

executes you for this!

Why don't you just
be a man and fight?

311
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,239
Luffy, just ease off some.

312
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,408
Why are you trying to get
on the Marines' bad side?

313
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,743

Yes, sir!

You are right,
Captain Morgan, sir!

00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,761

we collect don't even compare

to my sheer degree of greatness.

323
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,831
Yes, right, sir.

324
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,299
I guess that the
citizens' wallets

325
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,435
just aren't very deep
these days, sir.

[MORGAN]
The issue at hand here

327
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,140
is their level of
respect for me.

Nothing ever changes.

[ZORO]
I made a promise to her...

die in a place like this.

Don't you have things to do?

I'll untie you, but only if
you promise to join my crew.

00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,516
I run a pirate crew, and I'm

00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,588
Screw that business.

352
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,723
And what's wrong
with being a pirate?

353
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:18,691
They're despicable!

354
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,059
Like I'd ever wanna
join up with one.

355
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,694
Oh, come on! Gimme a break.

356
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,862
Everyone already knows you

357
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,564
as some viscious bounty hunter
always out for blood.

358
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,900
People can say whatever
they want about me,

359
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,570
but I've never done a single
thing in my life that I regret.

360
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,873
I will make it through
this challenge.

361
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,876
And after that, I'll
accomplish what I want.

362
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,078
Yeah... That's great.

363
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,881
But I've already decided that
you're going to be on my crew.

364
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,215
What?! You can't do that!

365
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,251
I hear you're one of
the best swordsmen around.

366
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,218
[ZORO]
Well, I am!

367
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,221
But that idiot Captain's
son took mine away.

368
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,956
Guess I'll just have to
go get it back for you.

369
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:51,590
[ZORO]
What?

370
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,225
So if you want your sword,

371
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,927
you're just gonna
have to join my crew.

372
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,729
Now you're really
pissing me off!

373
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,230
[LUFFY laughing]

374
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,901
Wait... he's actually
gonna bust in there alone?

375
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,635
Hey, genius!

376
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,738
The base is in the
other direction!

377
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,406
[LUFFY]
Huh?

378
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,410
Gum Gum Rocket!

379
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,611
What...?

380
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,581
What the hell is this guy?

381
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,284
[MARINES]
Heave ho!

382
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,086
Heave ho!

383
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,423
Heave ho!

384
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,592
[MORGAN]
That's it! Stop right there.

385
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,162
Now stand it up
in one final pull!

386
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,263
Well, dad?

387
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,299
Are you gonna get revenge
on this guy or what?!

388
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,101
I mean he just outright
struck me in public!

389
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,771
You never hit me before!
Why should he be able to?

390
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,606
[MORGAN]
Do you have any remote idea

391
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,776
as to why I've never hit you?

392
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,643
Well?

393
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,113
Uh... Is it because
you think I'm great?

394
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,515
[MORGAN]
No...

395
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,283
It's because‐‐

396
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,286
[HELMEPPO screams]

397
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,321
[HELMEPPO groans]

398
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,626
[MORGAN]
You're a stupid fool...

399
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,795
...who isn't even worth hitting.

400
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,131
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea.

401
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,836
The only great one around here

402
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,839
is the man you call your father!

403
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,541
[HELMEPPO groans]

404
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,809
[MORGAN]
Which reminds me.

405
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,145
I heard a rat snuck into
the crucifixion yard.

406
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,380
[HELMEPPO gasps]

407
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,483
Yes. That's right, the little
girl, but I had her dealt with.

408
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,151
I hope that means killed.

409
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,189
No, I...I didn't kill her.
She's just a kid...

410
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,156
[MORGAN]
You there!

411
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,692
Go into town, find this
girl, and kill her!

412
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,194
But... sir!

413
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,662
You can't be serious...

414
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,330
She's just a little girl, sir.

415
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,399
[MORGAN] I don't care
if she's a child or not.

416
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,335
Anyone who disobeys
my orders is a traitor!

417
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,837
[LIEUTENANT]
No, sir...

418
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,505
I can't do it.

419
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,340
[MORGAN growls]

420
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,675
[MORGAN grunts]

421
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,876
[HELMEPPO screams]

422
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,678
[MARINES]
Lieutenant!

423
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,180
You... You killed him!

424
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,718
My strength was what I used
to rise to the rank of captain.

425
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,853
Listen!

426
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,522
In this world,
titles are what matter!

427
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,858
That means by being the
captain of this base

428
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,760
and the highest ranking officer,

429
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,531
I am the most superior person
as far as the eye can see!

430
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,199
This means...

431
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,403
that I do everything right!

432
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,904
Am I correct, men?!

433
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,906
[MARINES]
Sir! You are correct, sir!

434
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,742
Let's put killing the
girl on hold for now.

435
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:24,743
Observe,

436
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,213
the greatest symbol of
my unending authority.

437
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,383
It took years to
complete, but here it is.

438
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,552
‐‐Now stand it up!
‐‐[MARINES] Heave ho!

439
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,254
[MORGAN]
Display my greatness at

440
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,223
the top of this
base for all to see!

441
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
That's weird...

442
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,395
There's nobody here.

443
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,397
I gotta find that
crazy idiot son

444
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,566
and get Zoro's sword
back for him. Huh?

445
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,401
‐‐[MARINES] Heave ho!
‐‐[MORGAN] Pull men!

446
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,636
‐‐Heave ho!
‐‐Harder!

447
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:55,574
[MARINES]
Heave ho!

448
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,309
[MORGAN]
You there!

449
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,610
[MARINE E whimpers]

450
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,480
You bumped it.

451
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,781
[LUFFY]
Hm?

452
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,317
Sounds like something's
goin' on up there.

453
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,586
I'm sorry, sir!

454
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,288
I was reckless!
I didn't mean it!

455
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,957
[MORGAN] I consider the
slightest scratch on this...

456
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,258
...nothing less...

457
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,763
...than a traitorous activity
that's punishable by death!

458
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,265
Guess I should check it out.

459
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,935
Gum Gum...

460
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,769
...Rocket!

‐‐[MARINE E screams]
‐‐[MORGAN yells]

462
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,605
[LUFFY]
Huh‐hoo!

463
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,273
Wah... I jumped too far!

464
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:28,807
[MORGAN]
Huh?

465
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,275
What is that thing?!

466
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,277
It flew up from the ground!

467
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,812
‐‐[LUFFY] Got it!
‐‐[MARINES gasping]

468
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,614

[HELMEPPO, MARINES scream]

472
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,287
[LUFFY]
Uh...

473
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,492
[LUFFY]
Sorry 'bout that.

474
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,797
Seize him and hold him,
so I can kill him myself!

475
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,332
[MARINES]
Sir! Right away!

476
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,633
That's him! That's the guy!

477
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
He's the one

478
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,369
‐‐who punched me, daddy!
‐‐[LUFFY] Hey, it's you!

479
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,370
[screaming]

480
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,305
I've been looking for
you all over the place.

481
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,674
You have something that
I really need to get back.

482
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,709
‐‐[HELMEPPO] Let me go!
‐‐[MARINES] Helmeppo!

483
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,543
[HELMEPPO]
Someone help me!

484
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,812
[MORGAN]
Do not let that man escape!

485
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,679
[MARINE J]
Captain!

486
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,348
There's someone in
the crucifixion yard!

487
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,482
What?

488
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,657
I'm surrounded... by traitors.

489
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,494
[GIRL grunts]

490
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,030
[MARINE K]
After him!

491
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:25,697
Hurry!

492
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,366
[MARINE L]
Sir, yes, sir!

493
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,037
Someone's rocking the boat.

494
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,007
[HELMEPPO screaming]

495
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,909
Okay, so tell me where
Zoro's sword is.

496
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,677
[HELMEPPO]
I'll tell you! I promise!

497
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,380
Just please stop dragging
me across the carpet.

498
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,514
Fine, which way?

499
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,551
In my room. We just passed it,
behind you on the left.

500
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,519
Why didn't you say so earlier?

501
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,054
Now we gotta go
all the way back.

502
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,055
Don't move!

503
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,024
Except for letting Helmeppo go!

504
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,692
No way.

505
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,396
But you can try
shooting me if you want.

506
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,931
[HELMEPPO]
No! Please don't shoot!

507
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,700
Don't‐‐ Get the
hell outta the way!

508
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,735
[COBY] You have to
get out of here, Zoro.

509
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,572
That maniac's going to kill you
for what you're doin' right now!

510
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,773
[COBY]
I can't stand to watch

511
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,876
the Marines behave
like this anymore.

512
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,545
A true Marine
should be honorable.

513
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,080
Look, kid, I can't leave!

514
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,082
I got ten days left.
And, then they're‐‐

515
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,618
Well, not quite. They're
gonna execute you tomorrow.

516
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,752
They're what?

517
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,055
[COBY] Helmeppo never intended
to honor your agreement.

518
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
He planned on killing
you from the start.

519
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:29,094
Which made Luffy really angry,
so he just knocked him out.

520
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,396
He did?

521
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,564
Now that the Marines are mad,

522
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,967
they're dead set
on catching Luffy.

523
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,103
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask
you to become a pirate, though.

00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,938
But I hope you'll help him.

525
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,407
You have a lotta
strength you can offer.

526
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,112
[COBY]
Luffy's the only person here

527
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,949
who can actually save
you from execution.

528
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,584
And of course...

529
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,920
You're the only one
here who can save him

530
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,989
from a very similar fate.

531
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,592
[MORGAN]
End of the line!

532
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,130
[MORGAN] For the crime
of treason against me,

533
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,166
I sentence you both
to die where you stand.

534
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,635
[COBY yelps]

535
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
This looks like yours.

[LUFFY]
Bingo!

537
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,145
Hold on. There are three here.

538
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,180
Hey, weirdo, which one
of these is Zoro's?

539
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,951
‐‐[HELMEPPO whimpering]
‐‐[LUFFY] Guess he passed out.

[COBY whimpering]

543
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,996
You've been pulling some
interesting moves around here.

544
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,867
What is this? Some kind
of poorly executed coup

545
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,536
you two planned
with the straw hat?

546
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,039
[ZORO] I've always fought
alone like a real man does.

547
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,640
Not like a coward...

548
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,643
...who hides behind his
wall of expendable cronies.

549
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,512
[MORGAN]
Roronoa Zoro.

550
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,148
Don't you dare underestimate me.

551
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,518
You may be a strong fighter,
but under my authority,

552
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,187
you're just the rat we
throw out with the trash.

553
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,689
Take aim!

554
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,690
[ZORO]
No...

555
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,028
[ZORO]
I can't afford to die here!

556
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,835
You're weak, Zoro...
Nothing ever changes.

That won't work on me!
