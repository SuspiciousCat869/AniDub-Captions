WEBVTT

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.114
[cackles]

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.159
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.192 --> 00:01:38.330
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:42.905
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.922
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:46.232
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.704
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.737 --> 00:02:52.011
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.881
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:56.253
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:59.024
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.936
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.744
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:13.019
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:16.092
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.929
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:20.166
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.672
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.277
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.515
Now, Usopp, Robin
and Franky hear of

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.022
the horrors that Dressrosa
suffered ten years in the past.

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.794
Even if you've forgotten,
I have not.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:37.367
Thus, I've returned to
take my place as your king!

00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:41.844
I'll sell you this kingdom for,
say, ten billion Berries?

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:44.081
I need to borrow
all of your money,

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:46.418
and I need to do so immediately.

00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:53.199
Stop it! I'm begging you!

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.303
[SOLDIER BB]
King Riku, please wait!

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:56.641
[SOLDIER CC]
What are you doing?

00:03:56.674 --> 00:04:00.981
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:06.192
[DOFLAMINGO] Oh, Riku!
What a naughty king you are!

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.396
The night's still
young, soldiers!

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.200
Don't just stand there gawking!

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.772
Why don't you join the dance?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.586
[DOFLAMINGO]
Parasite String!

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:21.690
M-My arm! It's moving!

00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:23.727
What the hell is
happening to me?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.100
Why? What's causing this? [sobs]

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:30.273
This must be what happened
to the king, too.

00:04:30.306 --> 00:04:32.177
[DOLDO]
What could I possibly say?

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:34.047
Nothing can justify this.

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.921
We're done,
the kingdom is finished.

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:39.759
We fell right into
Doflamingo's trap!

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:46.272
[TREBOL] Hey, hey! Can we
do it already, please? Doffy!

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:50.814
[DOFLAMINGO] Now, now.
We can't rush things.

00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:54.990
I need them trembling with fear,
in the depths of despair.

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:58.631
And when this kingdom hates
King Riku with all its heart,

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:02.304
that's when the
heroes can appear.

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:15.063
[LUFFY] "A Nightmare!
The Tragic Night of Dressrosa!"

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.786
[MAN AA screams]

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:34.503
[sobs]

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:40.514
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.286
What in the world has happened
to our beloved king?

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.223
The whole kingdom's in disarray!

00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:47.863
[NOBLE A] He looked amiss when
he left the palace earlier,

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.766
but there's no way
anyone could have predicted

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.168
something like this?

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:53.740
[NOBLE B] I fear this is more
than we can handle on our own.

00:05:53.774 --> 00:05:55.578
I have already called
for Naval assistance!

00:05:55.612 --> 00:05:58.249
Captain Vergo has stated
he's mobilizing in response!

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.453
[NOBLE A]
Ah! Splendid idea!

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.426
Oh, Father!

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:22.397
What's going on? Father?

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:27.642
[VIOLET]
Why are you doing this?

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:46.345
It's snow?

00:06:59.238 --> 00:07:02.846
Monet! What's going on?
What are you doing in here?

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.947
You're just a servant!

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.051
Why are you manning
the palace gates?

00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:09.926
[MONET chuckles]
Princess Viola.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.632
I'm sure you're confused
about what's happening.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.703
Perhaps you should
use your Clairvoyance

00:07:14.736 --> 00:07:16.172
to get a closer look.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:18.844
You might be surprised
by what you see.

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:23.052
And while you're here,

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:26.226
why don't you welcome our new
royal family to the throne?

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.695
[gasps]

00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:56.854
Who are they? [gasps]

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:58.190
[MONET]
Just relax.

00:07:58.223 --> 00:08:01.963
You'll be coming with us,
Princess Viola.

00:08:06.305 --> 00:08:07.875
[SOLDIER A]
The east tower has been hit!

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:09.411
[SOLDIER B] Pirates have
breached the palace grounds!

00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:11.916
[SOLDIER C] They've taken
Princess Viola hostage!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.421
The place is bigger
than I expected.

00:08:14.454 --> 00:08:15.725
Not too shabby.

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.795
[BUFFALO] Yeah! I could
get used to this!

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:19.632
[MACHVISE] The Young Master
will love this place,

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.135
it's got everything.

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:22.738
Halt, intruders!

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.576
[SOLDIER E]
Are you Doflamingo's men?

00:08:24.609 --> 00:08:26.946
[SOLDIER F] Monet! Let go
of the Princess at once!

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.253
[SOLDIER D] Are you responsible
for King Riku's behavior?

00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:33.426
Move along, we've got
a busy day ahead of us.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.633
Let's start with "cleaning up"
the palace grounds.

00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:39.572
Be safe, Father!

00:08:43.412 --> 00:08:45.384
[MAN BB screams]

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:48.791
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:08:48.824 --> 00:08:50.493
[DOLDO screams]

00:08:56.506 --> 00:09:01.449
[DOLDO sobs]

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:04.556
[MAN CC] Why are you
attacking us, King Riku?

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.693
[MAN DD screams]

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:11.435
[DOLDO]
Please! I beg you! Stop!

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.748
[MAN EE screams]

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:24.127
[DOLDO]
Stop!

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.703
[DOLDO]
If there's no way to prevent me

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:04.040
from hurting my own people...

00:10:08.383 --> 00:10:10.587
[DOLDO]
...then I'd rather be dead!

00:10:11.656 --> 00:10:17.133
[DOLDO] Someone! Anyone!
Please! Kill me!

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:20.841
[DOLDO sobbing]

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.020
[WOMAN A]
Why, King Riku?

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:29.926
[WOMAN A]
Have we done something wrong?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.696
I don't understand.

00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:37.575
[WOMAN A]
How did it come to this?

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:44.087
[WOMAN A] You were always...
a fair and just king to us.

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.297
[WOMAN A] You told us that
you needed all of our money.

00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:54.542
[WOMAN A] And we brought
you everything we had.

00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:03.627
[WOMAN A]
We trusted you,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.603
because you always put your
people first, no matter what.

00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:29.779
[WOMAN A cries]
You were our pride and joy!

00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:41.235
[BOY A crying]

00:11:44.675 --> 00:11:49.552
[MAN A sobbing]
King Riku...

00:11:49.585 --> 00:11:52.223
I can't believe you've forsaken
your kingdom like that!

00:11:52.256 --> 00:11:53.359
How could you?

00:11:53.392 --> 00:11:56.298
He took our money and
he slaughtered our people!

00:11:56.332 --> 00:12:00.974
He tossed us aside to
satisfy his own desires!

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:03.445
[MAN C]
King Riku, you monster!

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:08.055
[MAN C]
I hate you.

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:11.596
[MAN C]
You're...

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:16.105
You're nothing but a
low-down dirty scum-bag!

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:23.152
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming, crying]

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:28.095
[MAN KK]
Here comes The King's Army!

00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:30.667
Hurry! Get out of there! Run!

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:34.742
[gasping] No! Help!

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.135
[ALL gasp]

00:13:12.483 --> 00:13:14.221
[MAN LL]
Who are you people?

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:20.935
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:23.907
We have come to rescue
this broken kingdom.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.183
So say hello to your new ruler,
Don Quixote Doflamingo!

00:13:28.216 --> 00:13:29.752
Th-Those are pirates!

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:31.355
[WOMAN F gasps]

00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:32.858
They're pirates?

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:35.230
[gasps]

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:39.772
[MAN MM] They came to rescue us?
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:50.159
[MAN NN] They're saving us
from the royal army. But why?

00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:00.379
[MAN J gasps]
King Riku's here!

00:14:00.413 --> 00:14:02.383
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:14.040
Here's where I
make my heroic debut.

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:22.758
Are you enjoying
this dance, King Riku?

00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:24.695
[DOLDO groans]

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.536
[DOLDO screams]

00:14:30.273 --> 00:14:34.148
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasping]

00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:36.887
Trebol! Pica! Diamante!

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.923
Come out, it's go time!

00:14:38.957 --> 00:14:43.465
Now, get out there and cleanse
this country of its trash!

00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:53.954
He saved us. He saved us all!

00:14:53.987 --> 00:14:55.022
He's a hero!

00:14:55.056 --> 00:14:56.593
We somehow survived!

00:14:56.627 --> 00:14:58.997
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:02.571
[MAN OO]
Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:08.617
[TOWNSPEOPLE] Doflamingo!
Doflamingo! Doflamingo!

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.023
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:12.057 --> 00:15:17.067
Look at that.
They embrace violence easily.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:24.113
[DOFLAMINGO cackling]

00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.131
[CROWD yelling]

00:15:49.164 --> 00:15:50.934
Fight!

00:15:50.967 --> 00:15:52.704
[COMPETITOR A]
You coward!

00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.881
[MAN QQ] I'll never forgive
your family for what they did!

00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:05.429
[MAN RR] Do everyone
a favor and drop dead!

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:07.133
[MAN SS]
Chop her into pieces!

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:09.673
[MAN RR]
You're a piece of crap! Boo!

00:16:09.706 --> 00:16:12.143
[MAN SS]
Go to hell!

00:16:12.177 --> 00:16:18.590
[cackling]

00:16:19.525 --> 00:16:22.496
In just a single night,
the kingdom fell

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:25.236
into the vile hands
of Doflamingo.

00:16:28.408 --> 00:16:31.616
That's a terrible story!
Oh man, what a nightmare!

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:33.118
How utterly ruthless.

00:16:33.152 --> 00:16:38.663
[cries] I already
hate that Doflamingo guy!

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.705
Regrettably we fell for it, too.

00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:45.677
Thinking that King Riku
had lost his mind,

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.246
we reached out to the new king

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.419
and were duped into our
current circumstances.

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:53.927
I'm so ashamed of myself
for ever trusting him.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.966
So sad! That's a real shame.

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:59.370
It must be so frustrating
to know the once beloved

00:16:59.404 --> 00:17:02.711
king of this country was set up
and tragically died a hated man.

00:17:02.745 --> 00:17:03.780
Not quite.

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:05.617
For King Riku is still alive.

00:17:05.651 --> 00:17:06.786
Huh?

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.427
Princess Viola had an
ability that Doflamingo was

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.965
particularly drawn to.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:15.504
So she made a bargain with him.

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:19.545
If you promise to let my father
live, then I'll submit to you!

00:17:19.578 --> 00:17:23.085
Please! Anything!
Just spare him!

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:29.064
Still to this day, she works
under Doflamingo's command.

00:17:29.097 --> 00:17:31.402
Only now she is
known as "Violet,"

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:33.874
one of the Family officers.

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:35.944
She's an officer?

00:17:35.977 --> 00:17:38.516
Then King Riku is still alive
thanks to her plea deal?

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:40.019
That's right.

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.556
He's still out there somewhere.

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:44.127
Perhaps in this kingdom even.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.767
But I cannot imagine the
anguish he's carried with him

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.904
these past ten years.

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:51.876
Nor how hard this must be
on the former Princess.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.551
Fear, anger, tears!

00:17:56.653 --> 00:18:00.392
[KYROS] I wonder how she has
fared over this past decade.

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:09.779
[KYROS] There is also the
lasting pain the soldiers

00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:11.682
have endured this whole time.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.454
Just like King Riku, they were
forced against their will

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:16.927
into violent acts against
their fellow citizens.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.532
[gasps] You mean Doflamingo
didn't finish off

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.536
the royal soldiers that night?

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.207
Some soldiers surrendered
to Doflamingo,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.413
while others weren't so lucky
and were slain in the chaos.

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:29.184
The known survivors
are currently serving

00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:30.319
as guards for him.

00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:32.892
[FRANKY]
Ugh! Good-fer-nothin' sell outs!

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:35.831
Perhaps so, but I
believe it must've been

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:37.868
an agonizing decision for them.

00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:39.739
[MAN TT]
Murderers!

00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:41.374
[DOFLAMINGO]
They were only following orders

00:18:41.408 --> 00:18:43.312
of a deranged king.

00:18:43.346 --> 00:18:44.748
Forgive them and
I will put these

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:47.621
blindly loyal soldiers
to good use.

00:18:47.655 --> 00:18:51.194
Oh man, this story is chock full
of betrayal and suffering!

00:18:51.227 --> 00:18:52.865
These tears are rusting me, bro!

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.303
[FRANKY sobs]

00:18:55.336 --> 00:18:56.471
Oh, the humanity!

00:18:56.505 --> 00:18:57.641
You poor people!

00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:59.377
The suffering!

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:03.219
[KYROS] While a good
number surrendered,

00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:05.490
many men lost
their lives that day.

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:07.728
But even when you
add up those numbers,

00:19:07.762 --> 00:19:10.165
it doesn't account for
a kingdom's full army.

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:13.205
[FRANKY] Hm? Wait,
what do you mean by that?

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:14.608
It sounds strange,

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:16.813
but it seems I've
lost some memories.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.349
Others have, too.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:21.254
And how does that work exactly?

00:19:21.287 --> 00:19:23.058
I have a theory.

00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:25.998
Fraland, do you recall
what I told you before?

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:28.035
When we are turned into toys,

00:19:28.068 --> 00:19:31.241
we retain all our memories
from when we were human.

00:19:31.275 --> 00:19:34.080
But people around us,
including our families,

00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:37.286
lose theirs and forget we
even existed in their lives.

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:38.489
What the heck?

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:41.194
They're completely unaware
they've lost a loved one.

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:44.167
Even we toys can forget
some details as well.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.741
This is the most heartbreaking
tragedy Dressrosa faces.

00:19:47.774 --> 00:19:50.413
You mean, it's possible
that even some of the toys

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.416
walking around town
may have forgotten about

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.387
their friends and family?

00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:58.228
[ROBIN] And that could
include you as well.

00:19:58.262 --> 00:19:59.364
Precisely.

00:19:59.397 --> 00:20:01.869
But I do believe, even with
their muddled minds,

00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:03.338
that everyone turned into a toy

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:05.678
must feel vengeful
towards Doflamingo.

00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:06.680
[TOY MAN A]
Damn it all!

00:20:06.713 --> 00:20:09.017
How the hell did I
get stuck being a toy?

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.823
[TOY MAN B] Get away from
my wife, you scum bag!

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:13.993
Why won't the words come out?

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:15.898
[TOY MAN C]
Damn Doflamingo!

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.068
[TOY MAN D]
I curse his name!

00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:21.275
[TOY MAN E] Isn't there anyone
who could beat his ass?

00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:24.147
[KYROS] Doflamingo attempted to
bury the will of the people,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.886
but that naturally only fueled
the rage and insurgency

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:29.123
dwelling within the
shadows of this kingdom.

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:31.094
They long for revolution!

00:20:31.127 --> 00:20:33.800
The key to our victory
lies with them.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.069
That unknown quantity of

00:20:35.102 --> 00:20:37.941
downtrodden and
silenced individuals.

00:20:41.248 --> 00:20:43.018
I'm on the same page now!

00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:44.354
So you're counting
on that advantage

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:46.058
to win this thing then, huh?

00:20:46.091 --> 00:20:47.628
While the folks
gathered here may not be

00:20:47.661 --> 00:20:50.967
enough manpower to take on
a Warlord and his lackeys,

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.270
you're betting that
if you can recruit

00:20:52.304 --> 00:20:54.374
all the downtrodden
toys to join you,

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:56.011
it'll give you that extra edge!

00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:57.447
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.752
Wait. Are you seriously
getting yourself pumped up

00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:01.756
to take down Doflamingo, too?

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:04.895
Our only objective here is
to destroy the damn factory!

00:21:04.928 --> 00:21:07.233
We're ditching this place
once it's mission complete!

00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.202
Back me up, Robin!

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:10.005
I'll crush you, Doflamingo.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.677
Yeah, what she said. Wha?!

00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:15.951
Today will go down as
the day of reckoning!

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.923
This morning's incident was
a challenge from our enemies!

00:21:18.957 --> 00:21:20.392
It is no mere coincidence

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:23.298
that brave Uso-land
came to us today!

00:21:23.331 --> 00:21:25.604
Divine intervention
is telling us to fight!

00:21:25.638 --> 00:21:26.271
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:21:26.304 --> 00:21:28.142
What "incident" again?

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:30.914
Doflamingo's brief
abdication from the throne.

00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:33.553
Oh. That? Well you see, uh...

00:21:33.587 --> 00:21:37.026
Can you imagine the joy we felt
when we heard word of the news?

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.263
We thought it was a miracle!

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:42.436
However, when we found
it was a false report,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.809
we felt as if we had dropped
from the edge of heaven

00:21:44.842 --> 00:21:47.213
into the boiling pits of hell!

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:50.921
And yet, instead of being
trapped in our despair,

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:53.793
we decided to take
the final stand today!

00:21:54.862 --> 00:21:57.934
[FRANKY]
Aw crap. That's on us, isn't it?

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:09.892
Despite being retired,
you led your crew here anyway?

00:22:09.926 --> 00:22:13.934
Regrettably, I've yet to find a
successor to the Happosui Army.

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:16.573
If only I had a grandson
to take my place.

00:22:16.606 --> 00:22:18.375
Unfortunate.

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:20.681
It's not easy
being a pirate, huh?

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.417
[DOLDO] Perhaps it's
just my imagination,

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.188
but I feel like I'm
forgetting something.

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:29.163
I experienced a phenomenon
like this about ten years ago.

00:22:30.733 --> 00:22:33.105
[BOO] Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, where am I going?

00:22:33.138 --> 00:22:36.077
Grandpa! Please, you gotta help!

00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:39.752
[ABDULLAH] Oh no, what have they
done to Abdullah, the lone wolf?

00:22:39.786 --> 00:22:43.526
[JEET] What have they done to
me, Jeet, the maverick warrior!

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.032
[ALL]
Help!

00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:50.206
[LUFFY]
Zoro!

00:22:50.239 --> 00:22:52.076
That stupid Rooster head guy!

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.483
He told me he was gonna show me
the way but then he passed out!

00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:57.286
Is Zoro even here?

00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:59.057
[LUFFY gasps]

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.293
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:05.369
Hey! Zoro! Yo, Kin'emon!

00:23:14.822 --> 00:23:17.794
[NARRATOR] Luffy reunites
with Zoro and the others.

00:23:17.827 --> 00:23:19.264
Meanwhile, the conflict between

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.869
the two mighty warlords
rises to a head.

00:23:21.902 --> 00:23:24.340
Law's thirst for
revenge is strong,

00:23:24.374 --> 00:23:27.046
but Doflamingo's indomitable
wrath is about to bring

00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:29.751
their epic battle to
a horrific conclusion.

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:31.555
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:35.864
"A Showdown Between Warlords!
Law vs. Doflamingo!"

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:38.703
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
