WEBVTT

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.506
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.476
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.212
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.514
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.749
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.850
You can have it!

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:19.719
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.988
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.125
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.061
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.625
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.861
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:47.100
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.269
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.637
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.906
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.807
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.210
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.913
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.584
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.152
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.856
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.993
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.865
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.634
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.338
which is located ten thousand
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:26.539
The Fishman Pirates,

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:29.943
led by Hordy Jones and
assisted by Vander Decken,

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.478
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.347
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.082
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:39.652
and find themselves in
the midst of an all-out war!

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:41.521
After a change of plans,

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:43.890
Hordy threatens to
crush the entire island

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:45.992
under the weight
of a massive ship.

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:46.926
[AMMO KNIGHT A gasps]

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.328
What's wrong?

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.897
It's... there. Look!

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.299
Hordy!

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.068
He can still stand?

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.042
[LUFFY gasps]
I can breathe.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.955
[HORDY grunting]

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.994
[HORDY chuckling]

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.270
[LUFFY]
"Coming to an End!

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.439
The Final Decisive
Battle against Hordy!"

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:48.288
[HORDY chuckles]

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.864
If he's this tough,
his bounty would be high...

00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:01.567
...like a 100 million.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.539
He must be hurt.

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:14.547
[HORDY yells]

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.216
I'm not letting you
interfere, Straw Hat.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.519
Not a chance in hell.

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.054
The Noah will fall.

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.757
Just try to get those
vile human hands on it!

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.093
There's nothing you can do now.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:30.363
This is the day
Fishman Island dies!

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.733
[LUFFY]
Second Gear!

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:37.570
Now, Gum-Gum... Jet Pistol!

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.081
[LUFFY gasps]

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.283
[chuckles]

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.418
[LUFFY gasps, grunts]

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.988
[LUFFY screams]

00:05:56.022 --> 00:06:00.193
Poor Straw Hat. You're too slow!

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:09.602
Oh, no, Luffy. Please don't die!

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:14.240
[laughs]

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:17.276
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.680
...Jet Bazooka!

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.885
[HORDY yells]

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:28.154
[screams]

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.889
That won't stop me!

00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:33.226
Armament Hardening!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.562
This is it!

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.633
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.001
...Red Hawk!

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:43.870
[HORDY groans]

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:54.213
[HORDY yelling]

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:05.458
[HORDY yelling]

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:08.928
[chuckles] Don't you worry.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.366
If those don't hurt enough,
I can always make another set!

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.303
[HORDY laughs]

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:19.172
[LUFFY groans]

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.808
[panting]

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:24.677
Damn! How strong
can this guy get?

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.079
That Red Hawk woulda wiped
the floor with him before!

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:32.652
[laughs] After all of this,
my power still surprises you?

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.353
Come now, Straw Hat!

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:37.523
It was granted to me by
heaven to vanquish humans,

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.293
especially the likes of you!

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.196
You were so confident you
could gain the advantage

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:47.366
once you were able to breathe
freely, but it wasn't enough!

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.237
No mortal can best
the power of the divine!

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.474
I've surpassed the strength
of man and Fishman!

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:56.943
No one can stop my revenge!

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.649
[FUKABOSHI]
Hordy.

00:08:03.683 --> 00:08:07.453
He must have mutated far beyond
his physical limit by now.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.955
His anger towards humans,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.590
combined with the
Energy Steroid,

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:13.292
has transformed him
into a true monster!

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:17.063
I hope Straw Hat knows
what he's up against.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.531
Be careful.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.667
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Luffy's losing.

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:26.906
Do you think, maybe,
Hordy is really undefeatable?

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.275
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
The situation with the Noah

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.710
is increasingly dire.

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:35.214
The ship continues to fall
steadily toward Fishman Island.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:36.883
And right now on the deck,

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:40.753
Luffy and Hordy are locked
in a fight to the death!

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:42.488
[FISHMAN A]
We're about to be crushed!

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.223
[FISHMAN B] There must
be something we can do!

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:46.659
[FISHMAN C]
C'mon, Straw Hat!

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.129
[ZEO chuckles]
Hear that?

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:53.432
Sounds like our captain's
got the upper hand.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.668
We really were
chosen by the heavens.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.137
Our cause was the
right one all along!

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.039
Your leader is
tough for a human,

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.908
but he's reached his limits.

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:04.544
His odds of pulling
through this are laughable.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.413
[ZEO chuckles]

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:08.281
[BROOK]
No.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.248
[ZEO]
Hmm?

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:13.185
As I told you...
I have faith in our captain.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:16.656
Luffy won't be beaten.
I can feel it deep in my bones!

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:18.824
[laughs]

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.561
[ZEO grunts] You can die
laughing if you like,

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.362
but you're still finished!

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:27.533
[USOPP]
Chopper!

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.735
Are you sure you're
okay over there?

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.305
Oh, yeah, I got it
all under control.

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.573
With just one Rumble Ball

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.275
I can fight in this
form for three minutes.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:40.313
Plus, I don't pass out at
the end or anything like that!

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:43.783
Now you guys don't have
to look out for me so much!

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.585
Don't sell yourself short!

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.720
If you can do this kind
of stuff whenever ya want,

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.356
you're gonna be the
one looking out for us!

00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.191
[CHOPPER]
Uh!

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:54.560
Flattery'll getcha
nowhere, buddy!

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:59.131
Doesn't work on me! Ha!
Nope, not at all. [laughs]

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:00.833
That's creepy!

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.737
Now you've really made me angry!

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.706
I don't care how big you are.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:10.209
All it takes is one good
dosun and you're outta here!

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.046
Dosun all you want.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.216
Sorry, but I don't
plan on going anywhere!

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:20.119
Now, bring it on!

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:21.787
Nice going!

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.889
[DARUMA] Kya! You think
you can just chat it up

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.958
with your friend in
the middle of a fight?

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.628
You're lucky I don't
gnaw straight through you!

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.463
I don't know why
your Straw Hat pals

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.698
bother putting up with
dead-weight like you!

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.968
I'm gonna do 'em a favor
and put you outta your misery!

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.872
[USOPP]
Hmph. You're welcome to try.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:42.408
But first I wanna
show you something cool.

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.110
Pay attention!

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:47.179
You're about to see a magic
trick you'll never forget!

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.415
Ha! A special move?

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:52.451
If that's your game,
I've got plenty of those myself!

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.187
Maybe the Squid
Spear didn't work...

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.024
[IKAROS]
...but I've got another weapon

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:01.460
that'll cut through anything
you can throw at me-hhi!

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.829
Huh?

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:08.467
[IKAROS] Say hello to
the Light Bright Spear!

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.038
It's powerful enough to cut
a hole through your cockpit.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:14.573
This battle will
be over in one shot,

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.043
but it'll be won by me-hhi!

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:20.780
That does look pretty sweet,

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.248
but if I'm being honest,

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:26.018
it's still way less ultimate
than my ultimate weapon.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.287
You're squid-outta-luck
now, dude.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.256
[HYOUZOU groans]

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.958
What's a swordsman
without his swords?

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:36.062
What should I do?

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:39.131
If you're just gonna croak
like a frog, I'm done.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.733
Waste of time.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:45.938
[HYOUZOU] Heh? Maybe
I am a little like a frog.

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.677
[HYOUZOU] The kind whose
poison's enough to kill a man.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:10.896
Wrap this up, you said?
Not till I'm good and ready!

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.398
You think I got all puffed up

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:14.567
just to deal with
a loser like you?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.669
Quit dreaming!

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:17.837
You know, all I gotta do

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.805
is roll around
this plaza a few times

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:23.008
and all your friends'll
be smooshed flat as pancakes!

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:30.883
Uh, are you even listening?

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.753
[SANJI]
Sorry. I was lost in thought.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:36.322
You were ignoring me?

00:12:36.355 --> 00:12:37.490
Uh-huh.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:41.694
Trying to think of recipes,
for big, hideous blowfish.

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.195
What'd you say?

00:12:43.229 --> 00:12:46.899
All right, that's it!
I'm rolling!

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:49.101
Blowfish!

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:53.806
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.342
Have at you.

00:13:04.984 --> 00:13:09.555
[LUFFY panting]

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.657
He's bleeding.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.992
Poor Luffy!

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:15.394
Ya don't know
when to quit, do you?

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:17.563
Here you are on
the brink of death,

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:20.266
yet you continue
to stand against me.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.903
Just surrender.
Spare yourself the indignity!

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:27.039
[laughing]

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:35.347
I told you before.
Didn't you hear me?

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:39.251
I'll save Shirahoshi
and this island.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:41.187
Oh, Luffy.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.023
Because I promised my friend.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.225
Straw Hat.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.594
[LUFFY]
I'll protect them--

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:51.263
every last one!

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:20.059
[HORDY chuckles]

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:24.630
[HORDY] You humans can be
so arrogant, it amazes me.

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:26.932
You're more likely to
get yourselves killed

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.401
than admit how weak you are.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:34.373
[HORDY] So I'll have to
beat some humility into you.

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:38.911
[laughing]

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:43.015
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Can we finish this up already?

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:46.485
If you think you
can, be my guest!

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.123
Weepyhoshi, get outta here!

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.158
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Ah! Right!

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.294
Fishman Jiu-Jitsu.

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:56.996
Water Heart!

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.133
[HORDY]
Shark Pack, go!

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.478
Not fast enough!

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:15.281
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:18.284
[LUFFY grunts]

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:20.019
[LUFFY screams]

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:20.686
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.955
[HORDY]
Now die!

00:15:23.822 --> 00:15:27.893
[thudding]

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:35.100
[SHIRAHOSHI]
It can't be.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.971
Please, no!

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:47.246
[HORDY cackling]

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:54.386
Luffy!

00:15:56.021 --> 00:16:01.961
[cackling]

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.598
[HORDY chuckles]

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:13.839
[LUFFY]
Third Gear!

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:15.040
[HORDY gasps]

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:22.014
[LUFFY]
Armament Hardening!

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:27.820
Tch! How much does
it take? Insolent fool!

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:32.624
Now, Gum-Gum... Elephant Gun!

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:39.565
[yelling]

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:43.002
[laughs] It's no use!

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.905
Human strength
will never stop me!

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.041
I will have my revenge.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:52.244
Even if it's the
last thing I do!

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:56.648
Shut up! I've had enough of you!

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:20.239
Crush them... Noah.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.078
Kill them all. They've forsaken
their pride as Fishmen.

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.680
They deserve to pay the price.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.917
[HORDY laughs]

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.052
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.929
[yelling]

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:46.331
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:50.469
...Elephant Gatling!

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:57.643
[ZEO] This is my space,
you washed up pile of bones.

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.711
Take one step
inside this circle,

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:03.682
and you'll be dead all
over again. I promise.

00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:06.919
[ZEO chuckles]
Your move.

00:18:09.488 --> 00:18:14.493
[BROOK humming]

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.066
[ZEO]
Huh?

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.669
[BROOK] I'm terribly
sorry, but I've already

00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:27.072
made my way inside
the circle and cut you.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.575
Also, as a fair warning...

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.076
...this will be cold.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.912
[ZEO]
Huh? When did you get in here?

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:37.583
Song of Scratches...
Blizzard Slice!

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:43.222
[ZEO groans]

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:46.158
And now, a haiku.

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.896
A blood-chilling wind howls
from the land of the dead.

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:54.633
Sets skirts aflutter! [laughs]

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.869
[laughs] Gotcha!

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.475
Huh? What is this?

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:07.112
My Green Star.
Humandrake technique!

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.313
[DARUMA groans]

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.415
[USOPP] Those plants have
arms and leg-shaped roots

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.818
that attack and latch onto
whatever flies over them.

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.286
[DARUMA yelps]

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.954
Good luck with that.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.491
[DARUMA yells]
Now what?

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:24.596
[USOPP] Green Star Trampolia!
It's pretty self-explanatory.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.666
Anyway, now that you've been
catapulted into the sky,

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:30.135
there's not much you can
do to defend yourself.

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:33.005
Here goes! Green Star.

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.179
[GREEN STAR WOLF A roars]

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.347
[DARUMA] I don't care
about your dumb dog.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.216
I'll rip it to shreds!

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:45.751
--[USOPP] I wouldn't.
--Huh?

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:47.653
[USOPP]
See that red bulb on its nose?

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:50.656
If you attack, that thing'll
release a devastating shockwave

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.925
three meters wide, like this!

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.560
[DARUMA groans]

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.163
[DARUMA yelling]

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.266
[USOPP]
Impact Wolf! Awesome, right?

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.504
[DOSUN]
Dosun! Whamsun! Slamsun!

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.339
Better watch out
or you'll get hit

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:11.076
by the dosun-est
dosun that ever dosun'd!

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:13.979
Papara-Hammer!

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:17.683
Cloven Roseo Palm!

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.718
[DOSUN groans]

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:26.959
It brokesun.

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:30.529
Ika, Ika, Ika! Too bad!

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:33.632
You won't make dried
squid outta me-hhi!

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:35.534
Franky...

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.536
Ika, Ika, Ika!

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.672
...Radical Beam!

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:46.044
[IKAROS]
I was wrong!

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.513
[CHOPPER]
Whoa!

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:52.484
Huh? It's got a laser beam, too?

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.653
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
Badass!

00:20:58.023 --> 00:21:03.128
[LUFFY yelling]

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:09.635
[LUFFY yelling]

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:14.773
[JIMBEI]
Fishman Karate! Vagabond Drill!

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:16.908
And begone!

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.314
[WADATSUMI grunts]

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.184
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES]
Huh?

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:29.488
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A] Hold on,
did he just spring a leak?

00:21:29.521 --> 00:21:31.690
All the air's gonna come out!

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:35.827
[WADATSUMI groans]

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:38.330
Enjoy the view, it's your last.

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:41.400
Ah! Wait, you know how to fly?

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.735
You scared the guts outta me!

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:48.674
[SANJI] The last two years
were a stain upon my soul.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:51.243
[ALL]
Ooh, Sanji!

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:55.580
[SANJI] I went through
hell! It isn't fair!

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:56.982
He's on fire!

00:21:57.015 --> 00:22:00.118
[SANJI] I wanna burn
those days to ashes!

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.920
Hell Memories!

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:06.591
[WADATSUMI yelling]

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.460
[SANJI]
Scared the guts out of you?

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:11.630
Good, that'll make
the job easier.

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:15.901
Blowfish guts are toxic.
You have to take that part out.

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:20.272
[HYOUZOU]
Let's see you block this!

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:22.641
Quit it, frog. This is over.

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.810
I told you, I'm not a frog!

00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:28.080
I'm the master
swordsman Hyouzou!

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:29.815
Fishman Island's champion

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.718
of the octopus
eight-sword style!

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.988
Purgatory... Onigiri!

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:39.458
[HYOUZOU groans]

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.126
[ZORO]
My mistake.

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:45.530
Maybe you're not a frog
after all, but you did croak.

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:50.569
[thudding]

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.906
[FUKABOSHI gasps]

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.241
[gasps]

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.810
Whoa.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:01.913
[ALL]
He did it!

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.382
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Straw Hat beat him!

00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:08.553
Finally! Hordy is down!

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:17.429
[NARRATOR]
Even if Luffy can defeat Hordy,

00:23:17.462 --> 00:23:19.064
the Noah will
continue its descent

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:21.533
as if possessed by
the Fishman's grudge.

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:25.237
As the islanders stare upon it,
they are seized with despair.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.738
Luffy puts his life on the line

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:28.907
to break apart the
legendary vessel,

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.743
but it will take more than
that to save the island.

00:23:31.777 --> 00:23:33.345
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.378 --> 00:23:36.481
"Stop, Noah!
Desperate Elephant Gatling!"

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:38.884
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
