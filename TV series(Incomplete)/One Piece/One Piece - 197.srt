1
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:50,749
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:52,208
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,878
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,546
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:00,050
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,226
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,068
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:22,697
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,869
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:32,916
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,300
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,011
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,305
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,560
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,437
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:21,715
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,305
[LUFFY]
"Sanji the Cook!

25
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,600
Proving his Merit at the
Marine Dining Hall!"

26
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:38,023
Is what they said
about this ghost ship

27
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:39,983
falling from the
sky really true?

28
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:41,401
I don't buy it.

29
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:42,986
But if Navarone
is supposed to be

30
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:45,030
this great
impregnable fortress,

31
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:46,823
how else could one
little pirate ship

32
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:49,117
have gotten in here if it
didn't fall from the sky?

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,912
I heard that there wasn't a
single crewmember on board.

34
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,542
[ALL]
Huh?

35
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,752
[MARINE E]
What the?

36
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,003
[MARINE D] But the table
was set for coffee,

37
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,338
and it was still warm.

38
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,049
Like people had been there
until that exact moment!

39
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:08,261
But that's not all.
Inside the cargo hold...

40
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,429
[BOTH]
They found gold?

41
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:10,555
[MARINE C]
Shh.

42
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,931
They found gold all right--

43
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:15,310
ancient gold dug up from
some old ruins somewhere.

44
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:16,561
[MARINE AA]
I don't know about you guys,

45
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,938
but that's the creepiest
story I've ever heard.

46
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:21,149
So--so it's a ghost ship?

47
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,485
[MARINE B] Those poor
saps must've been cursed

48
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,820
for stealing all that gold.

49
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:29,657
[MARINE H]
Attention units 4, 6, and 10

50
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,576
under Lt. Commander Drake!

51
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,745
Assume battle stations
for yellow alert...

52
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,955
[MARINE J] I don't care
what kind of a ship it is.

53
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,500
Nobody picks a fight
with our fortress.

54
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,918
--[MARINE I] Hurry it up!
--[MARINE J gasps]

55
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,420
[MARINE H] Commanding officers
of units 4, 6, and 10

56
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:44,214
are to report to Control Room 1

57
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:45,423
in the central building...

58
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,677
I think I know where we
are and it isn't good.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,303
If I'm right,
and I hope I'm not,

60
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,680
then we landed right
in the middle of

61
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:55,266
an invincible fortress the
Marines call Navarone.

62
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,477
So what's our
next move, Captain?

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,939
[LUFFY snoring]

64
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,149
As usual, our captain
could care less.

65
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:06,277
[MARINE K] On the double, men!
This is an emergency order!

66
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,371
[DRAKE] We'll moor the
pirate ship to Dock 88

67
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,040
and run a full forensic sweep.

68
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,836
[knocking]

69
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,337
We have a situation!

70
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:26,381
Sir, some Marine vessels
outside the sea gate

71
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,716
are demanding entry!

72
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,967
Demanding?

73
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,385
[MARINE L] Since we're
in a state of emergency,

74
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,303
I advised them
to standby, but...

75
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,347
[OPERATOR] Sir, we barely
made it out of that storm

76
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,557
in one piece!

77
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,142
Please allow us to dock!

78
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,936
I don't know how much
longer we can stay afloat!

79
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,689
I don't care how badly
their ships are damaged.

80
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,816
There is a possibility
that pirates have

81
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,776
infiltrated this fortress!

82
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,195
So they'll have to
find help elsewhere.

83
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,698
If we let them in now,
it'll cause confusion that--

84
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,574
[JONATHAN]
Open the gate.

85
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:53,825
Huh?

86
00:04:54,826 --> 00:04:56,202
[JONATHAN]
Permit their entry.

87
00:04:56,286 --> 00:05:00,373
And immediately assign a
medical team to them as well.

88
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,708
Yes, sir!

89
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,880
Commander!

90
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,007
[JONATHAN] What a terrible
thing it is to be helpless

91
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,384
in the middle of the Grand Line.

92
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,387
Even someone like you can
understand that feeling.

93
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,598
Can't you, Lt. Commander?

94
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:19,267
Of course I understand.

95
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,353
To tell you the truth,
it's been quite some time

96
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,688
since I've gotten this
riled up about anything.

97
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,065
They can't get out
of the fortress,

98
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,484
so the problem
becomes finding them.

99
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,737
But why did they even
come to Navarone

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,156
in the first place?

101
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,659
Monkey D. Luffy.

102
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:38,411
[MARINE M]
We got ships comin' in!

103
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,373
[MARINE N] Proceed with caution,
we are now at red alert!

104
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,875
[MARINE O] Ready the
boarding inspection bridge!

105
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,303
[ZORO]
This base is huge.

106
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:58,723
Anyway, where the
hell am I? I'm lost!

107
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,229
[NAMI] Who decided that this
fortress should also be a maze?

108
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:07,857
It's so big I can't map it out.

109
00:06:10,068 --> 00:06:13,405
[NAMI] We have to get
out of here, and soon.

110
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:16,866
But the more time that passes,
the more lost I get.

111
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,870
Now, where have all
the others gone?

112
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,665
[gasps]

113
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,167
[NAMI]
No way!

114
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,294
What in the world is that thing?

115
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:30,130
Jeez, it's enormous!

116
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:32,966
Hey, where's the Merry?

117
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,135
The Going Merry's gone!

118
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:36,970
What did they do with our ship?

119
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,888
And where's our gold?

120
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:41,891
All our precious gold is gone!

121
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,935
Gold, gold, gold, gold.

122
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,188
And after we went through
so much to get it.

123
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,734
[NAMI]
Battleships?

124
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,861
They weren't here before.

125
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,446
[MARINE O]
You must be unit 31!

126
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,865
Report to the
building in block 7!

127
00:06:56,948 --> 00:06:59,159
[NAMI] Hmm. If there are
new ships coming in,

128
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:02,579
it means that this place isn't
a gigantic lake after all!

129
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,415
It is connected to the open sea!

130
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,000
All right!

131
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,670
Now I just gotta find the guys
and take back the Going Merry!

132
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,840
If I could somehow go
undercover as one of them,

133
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,635
I could find the guys,
and gather more information!

134
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:20,013
[MURRAY]
Where is it?

135
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:23,558
Luffy and Zoro are known by
almost everybody in the Marines.

136
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,935
But nobody knows
what I look like.

137
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,228
[MONTY]
I bet this is it.

138
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,146
[gasps]

139
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,522
Crap!

140
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,152
This fortress has
a terrible layout.

141
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,905
[MONTY]
It's like a maze.

142
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:39,991
[MURRAY] Excuse me. Do you
know where the kitchen is?

143
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,117
What?

144
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,578
Oh, the kitchen, of course!

145
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:45,330
I know right were it is!

146
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:47,999
We just arrived on the
battleships down there.

147
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,627
And of course the first
thing we do is get lost!

148
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,337
I'm sorry to hear that.

149
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,255
I got lost a lot when
I first came here,

150
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,591
but that must've been
at least five years ago.

151
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,760
--[MONTY] Five years you say?
--[NAMI] Mm-hmm!

152
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,471
[MURRAY]
Please take us to the kitchen.

153
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,723
We beg you. It would be
such an embarrassment

154
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,101
if we had to ask any of
the cooks here for help.

155
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,560
[NAMI]
Maybe I can just say no.

156
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:09,104
We just came from Marie Jois.

157
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:11,481
It wouldn't hurt you to
do us one little favor.

158
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:12,774
[NAMI] Well, it wouldn't
help me either!

159
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:14,275
Please say you'll help us.

160
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,528
Oh, sure, no problem!

161
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,448
So, do you two know anything
about our little fortress?

162
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,617
My brother and I know
much of the culinary arts,

163
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,327
but nothing about
this fortification.

164
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,330
As a matter of fact, we are
Marine chefs of some renown.

165
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:29,040
Wow! Celebrity chefs?

166
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,459
[chuckles] My brother
and I have been assigned

167
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,962
to take over as head
chefs of this kitchen.

168
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:35,922
On Marie Jois,
we satisfied the palates

169
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,299
of generals who expect
nothing but the finest.

170
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:40,427
We brothers are far
from the kind of cooks

171
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,262
who excrete insignificant meals

172
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,055
on a boat in the
middle of nowhere.

173
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,642
And we must prove to them that
we are in a different league.

174
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,561
[NAMI]
Oh, gimme a break.

175
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:52,230
I gotta ditch these guys and
find a disguise right now,

176
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:54,774
or we'll never get outta here.

177
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,902
Well! I guess that attitude
makes you guys the best!

178
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,029
Now, all you have to do

179
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:00,572
is go straight ahead
and take a right,

180
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:03,575
then take two lefts and your
first right and you'll be there.

181
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,285
--[MONTY] Merci.
--[MURRAY] Okay.

182
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:06,494
[NAMI]
See ya.

183
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,956
[MONTY] Wait, is this
the first right? Hm?

184
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,291
[MURRAY]
Huh?

185
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,377
[BOTH]
Huh.

186
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:17,922
This'll do just fine.

187
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,299
--[OFFICER A] Roronoa Zoro.
--[gasps]

188
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,633
That so called ghost ship

189
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:23,219
actually belongs to Straw
Hat Luffy and his crew.

190
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:24,721
We have been given
a secret mission

191
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,557
to track down and
apprehend the infiltrators.

192
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,267
Among them is one who
is considered to be

193
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,894
extremely dangerous.

194
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:33,271
{\an8}You mean the Roronoa Zoro?

195
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,939
The great swordsman
who used to be

196
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:36,483
feared as a pirate hunter?

197
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:39,027
Doesn't he use the
Three Swords Style?

198
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,737
[OFFICER A] Well, we're gonna
make him and his friends

199
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,989
regret ever coming here.

200
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:45,367
[ZORO] You're gonna
make me regret what?

201
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,370
[groans] I'm definitely
going in circles.

202
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,039
[NAMI] How can you just stroll
around a hostile fortress?!

203
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,916
I am so gonna kick your--

204
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,084
Oh, hey, Nami.

205
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,585
You'll get caught in no time

206
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,463
if you keep walking around
wearing those things! [groans]

207
00:09:58,546 --> 00:09:59,506
Hey!

208
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,800
You'll probably
get me caught, too.

209
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:02,759
[footsteps]

210
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,094
[BOTH]
Huh?

211
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,138
C'mon, Zoro,
you gotta hide, now!

212
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,432
Hey, wait! My swords!

213
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,017
Na-- [groans]

214
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,602
[MARINE R]
'Bout time to eat huh?

215
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:14,979
[MARINE S]
Yeah, I'm starving.

216
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,315
[NAMI]
All right. They're gone.

217
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,110
[ZORO groans] I'm tired of
all this sneakin' around.

218
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,986
Tell me again why can't
we just fight 'em?

219
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,029
[NAMI]
You idiot!

220
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,531
We don't know where
the others are.

221
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,573
If we did--

222
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:27,242
[ZORO]
Then they would show up, right?

223
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:28,993
[NAMI]
Hey, now there's an idea--

224
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:31,371
No, no, no!
The Merry's missing, too!

225
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:32,706
[ZORO]
Calm down, would you?

226
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:34,416
No need to shout.

227
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,167
Whoa. Would you
check out that view?

228
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,128
We landed in the dark so
I didn't get to see much.

229
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:39,087
[NAMI groans]

230
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,630
[ZORO]
Nice.

231
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:42,340
Hey, I bet if we wait here the
others will show up eventually.

232
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,551
Stop being so stupid
and listen to me.

233
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,177
What you're gonna
do is stay put,

234
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,721
'cause if you go anywhere
or do anything,

235
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:48,680
you're just gonna get lost!

236
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:50,056
Hey, stop that!

237
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,516
What do you think you're doing?

238
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,519
[ZORO groans, gasps]

239
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,604
[NAMI] I'll put this in
simple terms for you, okay?

240
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,607
You have no sense of direction
so I'm gonna find the others.

241
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,109
After that I'll come back--

242
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,028
[CHIEF CLEANER] Hey, you!
What are you doing over there?

243
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,654
[NAMI]
Oh, no! Game over!

244
00:11:06,614 --> 00:11:08,283
{\an8}Enough with the
slacking off, little missy!

245
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,160
{\an8}Now get back to cleaning!

246
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,663
Aye, aye, sir!

247
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,167
I tell you what,

248
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,419
all those ghost ship shenanigans
have really got me beat.

249
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,796
[MARINE R] Better get some
chow and get back to work.

250
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,550
Ghost ship, huh?

251
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,093
[LUFFY] Did you find
us something to eat?

252
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,095
It sounds like the
dining hall is that way.

253
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,638
Dining hall!

254
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,640
[SANJI]
Hold on a second!

255
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:33,850
What are you doing?

256
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:34,809
Take it easy.

257
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,729
But my belly needs meat now!

258
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,106
[LUFFY groans]

259
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,067
I need meat now.

260
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,860
You just won't give up.

261
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:44,694
[MARINE T]
Who's there?

262
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,321
Halt!

263
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,155
[BOTH]
Huh?

264
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,615
[MARINE U]
Strange.

265
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:49,866
Just hearing things.

266
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,034
It's no wonder.

267
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:53,370
We've all been on
edge since yesterday.

268
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,954
[MARINE T]
Let's get some grub.

269
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,878
We almost got caught
because of you, you dolt!

270
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,129
[SANJI gasps]

271
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,009
They'll never find us now

272
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,929
'cause we're gonna blend in
like chameleons of the kitchen.

273
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,014
Something smells good.

274
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,726
I guess this is it.

275
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,895
Could be interesting.

276
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,316
Hey, I heard that a couple of
battle ships docked today.

277
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,193
What? That means those
pompous brothers

278
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:26,778
will have arrived then.

279
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,406
[TOM] Yep, as a matter of fact,
they should be here any minute.

280
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:32,492
First impressions are important.

281
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:33,451
Show no mercy!

282
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:34,953
[COOKS]
Yeah!

283
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,082
[LUFFY]
Meat! I smell meat!

284
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,209
Keep it together, man.

285
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,169
Have you ever heard
the term "self control"?

286
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,713
Self co-what? Never heard of it.

287
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,631
Have you ever heard of the
terms "all you can eat meat"

288
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:48,174
and "unlimited refills"?

289
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,218
[SANJI gasps]
Hey! Luffy!

290
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,345
{\an8}Need meat!

291
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,058
[COOKS]
Huh?

292
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:58,518
[LUFFY]
Uh...

293
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,438
[LUFFY chuckles]

294
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,897
So you're the new chefs.

295
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,275
Well, are you the
Murray brothers or what?

296
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:06,151
Murray?

297
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:07,777
[SANJI]
Aw, man.

298
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:27,672
Hi!

299
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,925
So you are those arrogant fancy
pants cooks from Marie Jois.

300
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:32,427
Huh?

301
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,220
You're the guys who said that
you were doing us a favor

302
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:36,473
by coming out to this crap
fortress in the boonies!

303
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:39,267
And you said that we were
excreting insignificant meals!

304
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,935
You've sure got a lotta nerve!

305
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,980
This entire kitchen has
mistaken us for some other guys.

306
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,857
I don't know what you're
complaining about,

307
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,900
and I don't care.

308
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:49,110
Feed me! Give me food!

309
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,488
So you're here.

310
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:53,490
The world famous kitchen snobs

311
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:55,742
who made million-Berry
meals every night

312
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:59,454
for all the big shots
over in Marie Jois.

313
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,081
[BOTH gasp]

314
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:03,333
[JESSICA] I don't care
that headquarters sent you.

315
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,378
This is the most sacred
place in all of Navarone!

316
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,462
[SANJI chuckles]

317
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,755
Huh?

318
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,049
And if I don't approve of you,

319
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,676
you will never set
foot in here again.

320
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,594
Do I make myself clear?

321
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,262
[TOM, SHINPACHI]
Aw, yeah! She told you!

322
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:17,806
Tell 'em how it is, Jessica!

323
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:20,517
There are no less than
1,000 brave Marines

324
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,227
stationed at this stronghold.

325
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,688
And we show our respect to
each and every one of them

326
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,232
by preparing their meals
with all our might!

327
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:29,693
So they can stay strong!

328
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:32,987
In order for us to
achieve this great feat,

329
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,489
we work day and night.

330
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,450
And we never, even for
an instant, lose focus.

331
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:41,079
We're not like those cooks
who depend on expensive food.

332
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:42,956
We rely on skill.

333
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,545
Please tell me I can eat those.

334
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,881
Around here we can't forget...

335
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:53,508
...that great food...

336
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:56,594
...comes from a special
place in all of our hearts.

337
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:04,936
In other words,

338
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,689
you would presume to tell me
what real cooking is. Right?

339
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,315
No, I'm not trying
to say anything

340
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,109
quite as dramatic as that.

341
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,318
I just want you and your brother

342
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:15,280
to show us that pride
you talk so much of.

343
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,282
I'll give anyone a chance
to prove themselves,

344
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,868
no matter how pretentious
they might be.

345
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,746
However, there will be
trouble if I think you lack

346
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,582
anything at all in
skill or attitude.

347
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,167
Let me make this clear.

348
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,960
Unless you satisfy me,

349
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,339
you will never be able to call
yourselves cooks in Navarone!

350
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,673
I see.

351
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:38,303
That sounds like a
challenge, mademoiselle.

352
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,263
[MARINE V]
What is it? What's going on?

353
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:41,473
[MARINE W]
Well it looks like the cooks

354
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:42,640
are gonna have a cooking fight!

355
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,142
[MARINE T]
I gotta see this!

356
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,394
[MARINE S] Is that the chef
that came from headquarters?

357
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,815
You are allowed to use
any ingredients you like.

358
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:51,983
The rules are simple.

359
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,569
Each will prepare
meals for 100 people.

360
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,781
And the Marines themselves will
decide the contest's winner.

361
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,075
Whoa! I have no idea
what's going on,

362
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,743
but it sounds exciting!

363
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,912
[SANJI]
Start whenever you're ready.

364
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:07,290
[horn blows]

365
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,542
We can't lose this one, boys!

366
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,711
Cook as if your
life depended on it!

367
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:16,174
We'll cook using only the best
parts of the ingredients we got!

368
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:17,300
Huh?

369
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,266
[JESSICA] Is he admitting defeat
by not preparing anything?

370
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,688
--Finished!
--One hundred meals!

371
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,439
Ya like that?

372
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,401
This food looks so good!

373
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,944
Keep you hands off!

374
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:39,364
Of course, we normally prepare
1,000 servings of each meal.

375
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:41,825
And we're fast,
like sharks darting for prey!

376
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,452
That is the essence
of being a chef here!

377
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,122
[JESSICA]
Hm?

378
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,416
How terribly wasteful
you all are.

379
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,626
What's that guy up to?

380
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:54,295
He can't be.

381
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,006
No way.

382
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:58,341
He's using all our
leftover parts. Whoa.

383
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,302
Pulverize the tuna's bones
along with it's head.

384
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,305
[SANJI]
Next mix in the guts.

385
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:09,394
[SANJI] Add veggie scraps
and roll the paste into balls.

386
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,440
Then they'll be deep-fried.

387
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:15,025
Boiling fat trimmed
from the meat

388
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,360
until it becomes
soft and tender...

389
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:20,405
[SANJI] ...provides the
perfect compliment

390
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,615
to a sauce made from shellfish.

391
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,411
The bitterness of the
guts whets the appetite.

392
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:30,957
And the powerful flavor gives
new life to a tired body.

393
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,292
This brings us
to the preparation

394
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,960
of the vegetable dish.

395
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:35,962
The skins of burdock
roots and potatoes

396
00:17:36,046 --> 00:17:39,174
contain more vitamins and
minerals that their insides,

397
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,760
which makes them an
ideal nutrient source.

398
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,636
Finally, broccoli
stems can be used

399
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,348
to create a soft,
sweet scented dressing.

400
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,974
[MARINES gasp]

401
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,601
[SANJI grunts]
Voila!

402
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,978
Cuisine, a la carte!

403
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:03,031
This is a battlefield, right?

404
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,241
It's important that
the food taste good.

405
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,368
But more important than that

406
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:08,578
is making sure your
food stores last.

407
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,372
[gasps]

408
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,333
It doesn't matter if you spend
1,000 Berries or a million.

409
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,586
You should never waste
even a single scrap of food.

410
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,630
It is our duty as
cooks to utilize

411
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:21,800
every bit of our ingredients
with love and skill.

412
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,678
Just like loving
everything about a lady.

413
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:28,306
A wise old geezer
once taught me that.

414
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,350
[MARINES gasping]

415
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,520
[MARINE X] I've never
tasted anything so good!

416
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,688
[MARINE Y]
This is delicious!

417
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,647
[MARINE Z]
Amazing!

418
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,148
How stupid of us!

419
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:39,192
We tried to impress the famous
cook and he turned around

420
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:41,069
and beat us at
working class cuisine!

421
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,822
We did exactly what we shouldn't
have and tried to show off.

422
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,281
The food in
Navarone is different

423
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,492
from the food prepared
for the officers.

424
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,036
It's food for Marines
who live day to day.

425
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,039
That was Jessica's
belief, anyway.

426
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,083
To think that we,
the cooks at Navarone,

427
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,918
were picky about
the ingredients!

428
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,838
[LUFFY]
...87! 88!

429
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,132
--[JESSICA] Hm?
--[LUFFY] 89! 90!

430
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:08,179
[LUFFY]
91! 92! 93! 94...

431
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,389
Incredible!

432
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:10,807
Have you guys ever seen anyone

433
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,519
with such an insatiable appetite
for the food we've made?

434
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:17,605
One hundred!

435
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,526
[ALL gasp]

436
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:24,529
Are you okay?

437
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:25,488
[LUFFY panting]

438
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:26,990
[SHINPACHI]
What's wrong?

439
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:28,491
Just hang in there!

440
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:30,368
[LUFFY grunts]

441
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,954
So good!

442
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,165
Heh. Man, I'm stuffed!

443
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:36,750
Satisfied!

00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,710
[JESSICA chuckles]

445
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,045
[SANJI]
Let's go.

446
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,089
Yeah. I guess it is
about time we leave, huh?

447
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,217
Thanks for all the
food. Sure was good!

448
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:47,677
If it had been up to me,

449
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:50,347
I never would have battled
a woman as beautiful as you.

450
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,266
Until we meet again,
mademoiselle.

451
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:56,227
Hold it!

452
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,439
[LUFFY] Hm? Did you think of
something else for me to eat?

453
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:02,567
[JESSICA] Were you planning on
leaving me humiliated like this?

454
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:05,904
I won't stand for it.

455
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:09,115
I like your spirit
and your appetite.

456
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,826
As of right now,
you two are part of the team.

457
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,037
[COOKS]
Yeah!

458

[LUFFY giggles]

459
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,998
My sweet Jessica.

460
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,542
Oh, thank you.

461
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:24,130
[JONATHAN yawns]

462
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,133
If there's one thing fishing
teaches, it's patience.

463
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:29,678
Patience. Right, sir.
A valuable attribute.

464
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,054
They may be ignorant pirates,

465
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,597
but don't you think
they would be hiding

466
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,683
somewhere a little
less conspicuous?

467
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,976
This place is in plain
sight of everything.

468
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,603
There are some who
would choose to hide

469
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:41,022
when there is no
possibility of escape.

470
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,816
But among pirates
of that caliber,

471
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:44,693
it is certain there
will be one or two

472
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,070
who find the act
of hiding cowardly.

473
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:48,446
[SERGEANT]
You think so?

474
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,906
[JONATHAN]
Hmm...

475
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,246
Well, it looks like we have
our first catch of the day.

[SERGEANT]
Huh?

Stupid navigator!
