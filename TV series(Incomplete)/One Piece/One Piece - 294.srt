1
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,558
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,095
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,732
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,703
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,106
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,207
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,443
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,046
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,283
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,519
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:08,722
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,302
Tempest Kick Lotus!

13
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:29,442
Cry out! Song of Willow!

14
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,608
What the hell--

15
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,175
--is that?

16
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,261
A voice?

17
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,035
Hey! Keep movin'.

18
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:31,071
I don't remember telling
you to stop, Nico Robin.

19
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,241
Are you listening to me?

20
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,577
Don't forget who's
the boss here!

21
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,179
Alright, Lucci. Just drag her!

22
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,481
Pull her by the
hair if you have to!

23
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,486
It's an order.

24
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,522
Now come on. Start walking.

25
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,061
You're delusional, aren't you?

26
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,197
Oh, my. You're
honestly convinced

27
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,266
that the Straw Hats are still
on their way to rescue you.

28
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:01,768
Moron!

29
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,605
I've never seen such a
weak-looking pirate crew.

30
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,607
If that's your only hope,
that's pretty sad.

31
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:11,612
The only feeling left
in your body will be

32
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,648
an overwhelming and
eternal sense of guilt.

33
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,318
You will spend your days
in ceaseless atonement

34
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,420
for your arrogant
crime of existing.

35
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,456
You know it's true, Nico Robin.

36
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:55,121
Robin! Robin! Robin!

37
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,730
Wh-wh-what was that?

38
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,598
I heard someone!
Did you hear that?

39
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,166
Who was it?

40
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,113
It's big in here. Where am I?

41
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,585
I found you, pigeon-bastard.

42
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,728
"Resounding Bad News!
Buster Call Invoked!"

43
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,037
I must admit,
I underestimated you.

44
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,273
I never imagined you could
have made it this far,

45
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,442
and by yourself no less.

46
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,245
Who says I'm by myself?

47
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,080
Hm?

48
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,717
I couldn't have made it
here without my friends,

49
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,653
and even if I could,
I wouldn't want to.

50
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,589
But you wouldn't
understand that,

51
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,658
because all you people
think about are yourselves.

52
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,461
Soon, my whole crew will be here
and we'll put an end to this!

53
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,042
Tempest Kick!

54
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,653
Shave!

55
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,555
I'm starting to get
the hang of this.

56
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,124
Yeah? 'Cause I'm
starting to get sick.

57
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:41,328
I don't wanna hear that
crap coming from a sailor!

58
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,764
What? I'm a hero
from Sniper Island--

59
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,233
you must be mistaking
me for someone else.

60
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,070
My good buddy Usopp
is the sailor, remember?

61
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,472
Well, you're a sword
now--so deal with it!

62
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,110
Nice dodge.

63
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,279
Scary!

64
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't let your guard down!

65
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,714
Yeah, uh, right!

66
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,549
And stop doing stupid stuff.

67
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,285
Uh, yes sir!

68
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,587
Wait, what do you
mean "stupid stuff"?

69
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,622
That's rude, you jerk!

70
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,529
No good.

71
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,265
My legs are too
slippery for me to stand.

72
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,232
I hope you're proud,

73
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,703
'cause this power of
yours sure is creepy!

74
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:26,440
Say whatever you like,
I know you're jealous.

75
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,043
After all, you scarcely
possess a fraction

76
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,211
of my beauty and power.

77
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,314
I thought, if only out of pity,

78
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,383
I could at least give you
a pair of silky smooth legs.

79
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,586
You should show some gratitude.

80
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:41,488
How considerate of
you to think of me.

81
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,758
But really, what
good are silky legs

82
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,527
if I can't even walk with them?

83
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,696
Well, sometimes you have

84
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,498
to make sacrifices
to be beautiful.

85
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,133
If that's how you feel,

86
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,269
then why don't you
try it on yourself?

87
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,138
Why? I'm not an
ugly duckling like you.

88
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,609
I'm plenty gorgeous
already! Isn't it obvious?

89
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,378
Whoa, what a bitch.

90
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,546
What was that?

91
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,783
Oh, nothing.
Please, brag all you like.

92
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,719
It'll just make my
victory that much sweeter.

93
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:21,362
Damn it. What the hell was that?

94
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,764
Stupid deer gorilla going nuts.

95
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:27,268
I'll deal with him
when this mess is over.

96
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,537
I still gotta get the key
from that secretary lady.

97
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,213
Hey wait, you dumb monster.

98
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,047
Stop stealing my thunder!

99
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,401
Emergency! Repeat--

100
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,103
We have an emergency at
the front of the courthouse--

101
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,272
all available units
please report here now!

102
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,442
Let's go!
Eliminate the traitors!

103
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,044
You call us traitors?

104
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,579
Ha! Don't make me laugh!

105
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,647
You guys've betrayed
us every single day

106
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,416
for the past fifty years.

107
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,652
Give us back our
freedom, you liars!

108
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,220
You had a leash
on us for so long,

109
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,522
that you forgot,

110
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,658
but we're pirates and
pirates hate the Navy!

111
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,099
Let's crush 'em, Oimo!

112
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,068
Sounds good to me, Kashii!

113
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:36,203
Here we go!

114
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,205
Focus your attack on
one giant at a time, men!

115
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:41,441
Take aim at Kashii's feet. Fire!

116
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:48,816
Good!

117
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,550
Now charge and bring him down!

118
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,154
We may lose in size,

119
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:55,055
but our numbers
give us the edge!

120
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,323
Keep it up!

121
00:10:56,724 --> 00:11:05,299
Oi! That's bad! Kashiii!

122
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,368
Move on to Oimo! Aim and fire!

123
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,214
Sounds like bad news out there.

124
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,448
Those giants have
been holding back

125
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,584
the Marine forces
for a long time.

126
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,685
I'm sure they're wearing down.

127
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,275
Hey, hurry it up, will you?

128
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,211
Damn it!

129
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,780
I never thought a pirate
would make it so far.

130
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,081
This has turned
into a real disaster!

131
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:00,120
Hey, CP9, this is
your chief speaking!

132
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,323
What the hell are you
morons doing out there?

133
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:05,058
I've got one of the
Straw Hats right on my heels!

134
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,095
Are you even listening to me?

135
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,096
You answer when I speak to you!

136
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,438
Wait!

137
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,308
You didn't press
that button, did you?

138
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:33,253
No! This is the golden
transponder snail!

139
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,670
The silver transponder snail
has received a signal!

140
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,572
It's an emergency!

141
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,207
A Buster Call has been requested

142
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,542
under the authority
of Admiral Aokiji!

143
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,144
What's the location?

144
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,712
Enies Lobby!

145
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:02,616
Contact the five Vice Admirals
closest to that location!

146
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,151
All things considered,

147
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,520
it may be faster to reach
there from headquarters.

148
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,788
How long, then?

149
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,490
No more than
thirty minutes, sir.

150
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:12,693
In that case, prepare ten
battleships for departure

151
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:16,063
and inform the Vice Admirals
of the situation.

152
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:16,797
Make it quick!

153
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,299
Yes sir!

154
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:19,767
A Buster Call
has been requested!

155
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,136
The destination is Enies Lobby!

156
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,005
Prepare ten battleships
for sail immediately!

157
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,242
Hello? Hello?

158
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,743
What is it, Chief?

159
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,412
Oh, now I get through.

160
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,314
This is the one
I was trying to use.

161
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,115
Not that it matters anymore.

162
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,717
There's no turning back now.

163
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,519
I pushed the button.

164
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,421
Of all things!

165
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:46,726
I triggered the Buster Call!

166
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:04,778
Of all things!

167
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,684
I triggered the Buster Call!

168
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,725
Did he say
"Buster Call"? No way.

169
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,593
Is he supposed to
be talking to us?

170
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,562
You have to cancel
it right away!

171
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,464
Don't you realize
what you've done?

172
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:26,267
Hey! That's Robin's voice!

173
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,302
Everyone is going to die!

174
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,437
Robin?

175
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,208
"Cancel it"? Are you kidding?

176
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,310
Who do you think
you're talking to?

177
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,312
You can't boss me around!

178
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,447
Why are they broadcasting this?

179
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,116
Hey! You! Don't move!

180
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,583
I can't--I'm tied up!

181
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,358
And so what?

182
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,629
I mean, what's wrong with
the Buster Call, anyway?

183
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,232
That's Chief Spandam
talking -- I'm sure of it.

184
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,040
There's no reason for me
to get worked up over this.

185
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,142
Making that call was
well within my power!

186
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,478
I'm the Chief of Cipher Pol
Number 9, after all!

187
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,615
To ensure that your transfer
goes over smoothly,

188
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,051
I requested a Buster Call.

189
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,820
There's not a thing
wrong with that!

190
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,489
Who cares if it's
a little overkill?

191
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,224
Better safe than sorry!

192
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,693
It's a small price
to pay to make sure

193
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,761
those pirates get eliminated!

194
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,831
You're a fool!

195
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:34,301
I told you before,
that won't be the end of it!

196
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,470
This is an attack without mercy!

197
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,505
Without humanity!

198
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,441
I know that's the chief talking,

199
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,610
but I don't recognize
the woman's voice.

200
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,411
The Buster Call
will burn everything

201
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,347
on Enies Lobby to the ground!

202
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,449
The people, the buildings,
even the island itself!

203
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,759
It will sacrifice anything
and everything in its path.

204
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,428
The nightmare won't
end until nothing remains!

205
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,530
That's the power
you're invoking!

206
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:07,167
If you had any idea what
happened in Ohara years ago,

207
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,269
you would not be doing this!

208
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,156
The government is well aware
of the sacrifices involved.

209
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,092
That's how important
this mission is!

210
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,662
Since Cutty Flam burned
the blueprints to Pluton,

211
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,163
we can't afford
to make a mistake.

212
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:54,048
You're the last hope we have
of reviving the ancient weapon.

213
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,683
We're talking about
a military power

214
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,652
that can turn this
whole era upside down!

215
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,089
Even if we have to sacrifice
a few thousand soldiers,

216
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:05,192
it's better than letting you
slip out of our hands again!

217
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,462
I know the consequences,
I just don't care!

218
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,130
Don't think of this as murder--

219
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,632
it's a sacrifice to
protect the future!

220
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,203
And speaking of
"protecting the future",

221
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,305
my promotion is
depending on this as well!

222
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,507
Hey, wait a second,
can we vote on this?

223
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,343
What does he
mean by "sacrifices"?

224
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,677
Are they gonna kill us?

225
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,045
Think about this!

226
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,647
Human lives are at stake!

227
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,482
Allow me to remind you,

228
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,552
CP9 can kill in
the name of justice.

229
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,520
Therefore, if we think
100 deaths are needed

230
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:37,057
to save 1000 lives,
then we will kill

231
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,460
those 100 people
immediately, without question.

232
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:51,104
For true justice, you
must be merciless at times.

233
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,442
Besides, if those idiot
soldiers couldn't even stop

234
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,578
a few pirates from invading
a government base

235
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,047
of this size, they're
better off dead anyway!

236
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,087
I think the line
is still connected

237
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,622
on your transponder snail.

238
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:13,060
Ah, you gotta be
freakin' kidding me!

239
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,695
Everyone heard all of that?

240
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,706
By the way, this is uh,
Straw Hat Luffy speaking.

241
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,775
Like we believe that!

242
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,643
Everyone get off
the island! Hurry!

243
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,346
A Buster Call has been
invoked on Enies Lobby!

244
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,215
If you don't get away from
here immediately, you'll die!

245
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,216
Hey!

246
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,418
Don't tell them things
they don't need to know!

247
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:50,331
Well, what should we do now?

248
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:54,568
I can't say I'm happy, but
there's nothing we can do.

249
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,638
Shoulda seen it coming
with that idiot in charge.

250
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,608
Sounds like they're
in some sort of trouble.

251
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,244
The one in trouble here is me!

252
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,546
You poor, miserable things.

253
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,349
All of your hopes
completely shattered.

254
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,184
I wouldn't worry too much.

255
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:12,152
When it comes down
to the wire like this,

256
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:14,254
we always pull together!

257
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,293
Poor Pirate Boy,
you musta been born

258
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,264
under a bad sign to
have luck like this.

259
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,531
But on the other hand,

260
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:27,200
you probably like
it this way, don't ya?

261
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,207
We're gonna get hit
with a Buster Call!

262
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,575
Battleships are coming!

263
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:38,245
Get away from Enies Lobby!

264
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,349
I get that battleships
are coming,

265
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,118
but why are the
Marines running away?

266
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,420
She said the island was
gonna be burned to the ground.

267
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,188
Why would they burn
down their own island?

268
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,124
I don't know! Don't ask me!

269
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:53,560
Hey, if you're gonna run,
at least untie us!

270
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,336
It's a Buster Call!

271
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,371
If you stay here, you'll die!

272
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:06,106
Bring as many ships as you can

273
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,608
and get ready to set sail!

274
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:11,545
The battleships could
be here any second!

275
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,384
Guess they left us behind.

276
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,186
Hey! This is dangerous!

277
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,554
Get us outta here, dammit!

278
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:21,755
Are you kidding?

279
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:24,291
It's been dangerous ever since
we set foot on this place.

280
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,593
What about our big bro?

281
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:27,394
What's gonna happen to Franky?

282
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,229
There's no way we're
leaving without him!

283
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,231
We'll wait as long as it takes!

284
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,766
The Straw Hats are coming, too!

285
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,700
W-wait.

286
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,169
Are you saying we
should just sit here?

287
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:36,570
Get blown up?

288
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,072
Come on, guys.

289
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,473
There's gotta be
something we can do!

290
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,812
We can't afford to
screw around anymore.

291
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,513
Then let's finish them off quick

292
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,383
and get to the Gates of
Justice while we still can.

293
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,618
I just thought of something.

294
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:51,819
Huh? Oh yeah?

295
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,621
Like a way to get
the handcuffs off

296
00:20:53,654 --> 00:20:55,155
without any blood?

297
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,358
Or maybe a way
to get out of here?

298
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,360
As a sword, you will be known

299
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:01,562
as the great blade "Nose Storm".

300
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,431
That's kind of awesome,
but now's not the time!

301
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,634
Chopper! Where are you?

302
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,449
Why couldn't you keep
your damn mouth shut?

303
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:26,787
Now the whole
island's in a panic!

304
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,823
What if those pirates
get away, huh?

305
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:34,227
You realize they're gonna
blame me for that, right?

306
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:40,367
Hey, wait a second!

307
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,771
If that was Robin talking,
then where is she?

308
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,673
Right behind these
doors, of course.

309
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,182
As you seem to have surmised,

310
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,450
you'll have to go
through me first.

311
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,331
Outta my way.

312
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:47,568
I'm not gonna let you keep
me from Robin any longer.

313
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,169
Say what you like.

314
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:53,039
This is the end.
You'll never see her again.

315
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,143
I made a promise, and
I'm not gonna break it.

316
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,786
I'm coming for you, Robin!

317
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,128
What did you do to me?

318
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,663
My whole body's slippery!

319
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,731
I'm sorry, but now
that the Buster Call

320
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:20,734
has been requested,
I'm afraid playtime is over.

321
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:21,802
Tempest Kick!

322
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,705
What? How did I miss?

323
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:28,042
I call that my "Mirage Tempo."
Pretty handy, huh?

324
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,643
On the next One Piece:

325
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:33,080
"Five Namis?
Nami Strikes Back with Mirages!"

326
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,415
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
