00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,689
[USOPP]
Are you sure you'll be okay?

177
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:04,624
Yeah, I'm sure.

178
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,093
I want to do whatever
I can to help out.

[gasps]

180
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,328
I should blend in fine
like this, shouldn't I?

181
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,199
[USOPP] All right! Now that's
what I call a brave reindeer.

182
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,667
[VIVI]
I really appreciate your help.

183
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,635
[SANJI]
Just leave it to us.

184
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,670
[VIVI] I made a list
of everything we need.

185
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,505
Oh, and we'll need
some clothes, too.

186
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,506
[SANJI]
Huh?

187
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,841
[VIVI] Normal clothes,
so we won't stand out.

Ah.

189
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,543

And perfume too?

Of course, Nami.

00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,711

194

Shut up with that!

And keep an eye out for Luffy.

Damn it... Where could that
idiot have run off to now?

[LUFFY sighs]

198
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,195
[LUFFY] Doesn't really
seem like there are any

I ended up, anyway?!

[LUFFY]
Oh well.

203
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,476
I guess I'll just
go back that way.

00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,643
Mm!

205
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,714
[LUFFY]
That's smoke.

206
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,150
If there's smoke, there's fire.

207
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,252
And if there's fire...

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,522
...there might be cooking!

That's what's great
about traveling around.

They have all sorts of
interesting ingredients to try.

Hm?

[SANJI]
What's wrong, Chopper?

215
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,213
There's a strange scent mixed
in with the smell of the food.

216
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,382
In what way?

217
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,252
Oh, what you're smelling
is just perfume.

218
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,219
[CHOPPER]
Perfume?

219
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,687
[SANJI] Yeah, that shop
over there sells it.

Uck...

221
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,223
I just don't like
that smell at all.

here to shop for supplies!

Yeah, I know that!

234
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,778
It's getting to be too much...
I can't stand the smell anymore!

Now, now. Relax, it's okay.

This isn't good.

I think I'm starting to get
symptoms of heat stroke.

243
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,473

it's cool and shady, quickly!

I'll just take a quick nap

[CHOPPER snoring]

00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,951
[VIVI] Nanohana is famous
for selling perfume,

258
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,886
but the perfume itself
is actually made at an

Hm...

00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,062
I dunno, this doesn't really
look like a restaurant.

Is anyone here?

It's not all that easy to get.

right now is temporary.

00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,076
It can be used to artificially
produce rain, right?

Good, all right.
Dance Powder works like this.

435
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,246
When you burn it, you
release it into the air,

436
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,981
and it's like planting a
type of seed, a rain seed.

even know the first thing

about this country, do you?

[LUFFY] Nope. I just
landed here by boat.

see here in Alabasta,

What do you mean?

when there is no water

[KOMANEGI] Anyway, our country
never gets much rain.

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,916

scarce in recent years.

That sounds bad.

[KOMANEGI] And most of
the oases have dried up.

458
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,421
[LUFFY] So just use the
mystery powder, then.

That's what you would think!

00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,658
But as I told you, the
World Government has now made

Dance Powder illegal.

00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,097

punishable by execution!

[LUFFY]
Mm.

464
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,200

is also supposedly what

much about that, though.

00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,039
Compared to the lovely ladies,

519
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,707
you two look like
sloppy bandits.

520
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,576
You might wanna
look in a mirror.

521
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,543
Hey Chopper!

It's that smell!

525
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,715
Oh yeah, where did
you run off to?

526
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,416
Just somewhere.

527
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,550
[NAMI]
Is he not feeling well?

528
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,554
Yeah, it's just the perfume.
Chopper can't stand it.

529

‐‐[NAMI] Perfume?
‐‐[VIVI] Oh, yeah...

530
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,226
Tony has an incredibly
sensitive nose.

531
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,160
This stuff?

532
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,062
Some of it does have
a really strong smell.

533
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,796
Oh...

534
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,730
[CHOPPER screams]

535
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,498
[SANJI] You smell
just like an angel in a

536
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,733
field of fresh flowers!

537
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:35,567
You're an idiot.

538
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,768
[SANJI yells]

539
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,836
At any rate.

540
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,105
At least we've managed to
gather all the supplies

541
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,807
that we're gonna need
to cross the desert.

542
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,808
Yeah...

543
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,677
This oasis... you said
it's called Yuba, right?

544
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,346
Yes, that's correct.

545
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,315
But first we'll have to
travel through the desert.

546
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,185
That trip... will most likely
be a lot more difficult than

547
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,687
any of you can even
begin to imagine.

548
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,257
There's no telling what
might happen out there.

549
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,593
One wrong step at any moment
in a desert land like this one,

550
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,263
and there's no guarantee
that we'll all survive.

551
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,365
I'm still a little reluctant
about asking you to

552
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,201
follow me into such
a dangerous place.

553
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,636
But more than anything,

554
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,639
I want to bring peace
back to Alabasta Kingdom.

555
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,340
So I guess...

556
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,210
I guess I don't really
have any choice but to ask.

557
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,148
Help me! Please, help me
bring peace back to my country.

558
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,850
Please help...

559
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,485

Well you finally said it.

It's about time.

562
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,622
There's no telling what might
happen on the sea, either.

563
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,457
We're used to it. Am I right?

564
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,526
Yeah, it'll be just
like any other day.

565

to see the desert.
