1
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,391
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:40,728
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,565
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:49,536
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:51,739
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:52,840
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,277
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,679
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,116
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,352
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,555
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,460
So, what's your plan now?

13
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,562
Just take me to shore already.

14
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,099
I wanna hurry up and knock you
out and get this over with.

15
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,435
That's it. I'm sick of your
talking.

16
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:22,402
Sick of it.

17
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,671
I'm gonna shut you up
right here and now!

18
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,678
Super cartwheel.
Iron Ball!

19
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,413
I'm gonna slam
you into the tower

20
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,247
and smash you to pieces!

21
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,217
That's your plan?

22
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,753
Well that would pulverize me,
gotta give you that.

23
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,089
Franky Centaur!

24
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,294
Chapa?

25
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,696
I've got both your legs.

26
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,431
As long as I've got
you bound like this,

27
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,832
you can't move around!

28
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,367
That doesn't mean anything.

29
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,368
At the speed we're going,

30
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,438
there's nothing you can
do to slow us down now!

31
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,406
Well let's just see about that.

32
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:04,311
70 mm Caliber Cola Cannon!

33
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,080
Just a little Coup de Vent!

34
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,784
He stopped our momentum!

35
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,053
We're not even rotating anymore!

36
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,822
Damn you!

37
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,190
That's far enough.

38
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,225
We're right above the shore.

39
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,526
Now, take this.

40
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,764
70 mm Caliber 1 point
5 Max Cola Power!

41
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,299
Coup de--

42
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:25,933
Stop it!

43
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,634
What're you trying to do?

44
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,775
Just give up already,
you bastard!

45
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,476
Coup de--

46
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,778
Vent!

47
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,788
Super!

48
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,069
Yoyoi!

49
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,272
There's no way.

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
He busted out of the fridge?

51
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,184
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

52
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:21,121
Thank you. Thank you.

53
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,489
Thank you!

54
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:29,363
I am so full!

55
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,831
Holy crap, he got fat!

56
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,167
You cannot be serious!

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,302
Did you eat every piece
of food in there?

58
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,772
What the--?

59
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,749
Shing!

60
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,386
Alright, Sniper King.

61
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,388
Just hold that posture.

62
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,557
You are now a sword.

63
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,392
Someone get me a lawyer!

64
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:03,063
There is no way I am not
gonna sue your ass off for this!

65
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,099
Whatever you say.
In the meantime.

66
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,267
I'd like my sword to shut up.

67
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,207
Wake up! Wake up!
This is a dream!

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,409
Oh, why won't the morning come?

69
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,343
Hmph.

70
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,212
They're good for a laugh,
if nothing else.

71
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:21,448
I love it!

72
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,589
Oni...

73
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,524
Wait!

74
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,625
Do you think we could start off

75
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,459
with a different move?

76
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,262
One that doesn't
use swords? Please?

77
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,696
...giri!

78
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,072
Ow. Ow. I'm seeing stars.

79
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,608
Don't move an inch! Tiger...

80
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,209
Let's just calm down.

81
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,411
No violence. Talk this over!

82
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,114
Damn!

83
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,618
Yep. I think my nose is broken.

84
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,620
I said not to move, didn't I?

85
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,822
If it's so easy, then you do it!

86
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,157
Are they making fun of us?

87
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,224
I'm not sure.

88
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,826
Maybe they're just that stupid.

89
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,596
Looks like we're back to the
rock-paper-scissors plan.

90
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,198
Better to lose a hand
than lose the fight.

91
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,366
No!

92
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,235
Can't you come up
with a better idea?

93
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,036
One that doesn't involve blood?

94
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,705
No. No, I can't.

95
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,407
You didn't even think
about it, did you?

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,677
Actually, maybe I don't have
a hand to spare after all.

97
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,618
Just give up yours, all right?

98
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,153
If CP9 doesn't
kill me, Zoro will.

99
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,223
Hurry Chopper!
You gotta save me!

100
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,227
"Uncontrollable!

101
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,395
Chopper's Forbidden Rumble!"

102
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,008
Yoyoi!

103
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,046
Yoyoi!

104
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,786
I don't think
I've ever seen anyone

105
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,788
with so little self-control.

106
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,724
You gained all that weight
in just a few minutes?

107
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:20,100
Thank you for your
concern, but I-I-I-I--

108
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,802
Who said I'm
concerned about you?

109
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,737
Okay! I get it!
You're just fine!

110
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,639
Don't talk with
food in your mouth!

111
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,809
Mmhmm.

112
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,446
"I'm just fine". Yes, thank you.

113
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,615
That is indeed what
I was trying to-trying to--

114
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,551
I don't know what you're
trying to do, but stop it!

115
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,054
You're okay, I'm okay,
everything's great.

116
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,322
Now get back here!

117
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,559
Ah, yes, yes, of course,
where was I again?

118
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,828
I shall solve this shortly.

119
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:53,633
Now observe. My "Life Return"!

120
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:03,677
Digest! Absorb! Complete!

121
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,815
What? What the heck are you?

122
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,416
What did you just do?

123
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,086
I mean, could you
do it again, please?

124
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,521
Yes. As you wish.

125
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:20,794
Life. Return!

126
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:25,733
Now Digest! Absorb!

127
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,534
Cool! One more time!

128
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,137
One more time?

129
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,375
Uh, Life Return!

130
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,277
Then Digest, and Absorb!

131
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,416
So awesome!

132
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,784
How do you do that?

133
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,785
Well!

134
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:48,355
How kind of you to ask!

135
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,491
A thousand years at sea,

136
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,493
a thousand years
in the mountains.

137
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,429
Breathing in the wind and
drinking the morning dew,

138
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,198
I lived as a hermit
to complete my training.

139
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,801
And lo! At long last,
the secrets of

140
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,204
"Life Return" revealed
themselves to me!

141
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,409
From your head,
down to your toes.

142
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,811
Every inch of the human body

143
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:14,114
can be controlled
with strength of will.

144
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,783
Why you can even command

145
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,454
your internal organs and
each hair to its very tip.

146
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,558
Using the mind to control
the workings of the body.

147
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,262
I've read about something
similar in a medical journal.

148
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,332
They called it "biofeedback."

149
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,167
Then you're able
to move your hair

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,703
around like an octopus
because of that power?

151
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,373
Yoyoi! An octopus?

152
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,675
How rude of you!

153
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:50,117
I am, as you say, a shishi!

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,622
A valiant lion, in other words!

155
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,657
Octopus. Lion. Whatever.

156
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,529
Life Return! And Hair Bind!

157
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,535
Yoyoi!

158
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,778
Yoyoi!

159
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,218
Oh no.

160
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,088
If I get caught by
his hair, it's all over!

161
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,290
Shave!

162
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,724
Where'd he go?

163
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,365
Finger Pistol Q!

164
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,304
He did that with a blunt stick?

165
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,744
Q! Q! Q!

166
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,713
Heavy Point!

167
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,248
Iron Body!

168
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,585
Yoi!

169
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,256
Ow ow ow ah!

170
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,391
What is the matter?

171
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,530
Damn it. I thought so.

172
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,599
Unless I can hit him
with Arm Point

173
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:13,366
or Horn Point,
he's not gonna budge.

174
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,739
But the rumble balls
are powerful.

175
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,642
One in six hours is
about all I can handle.

176
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:25,179
Any more than that will put
too much strain on my body.

177
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,781
Even worse, if I take another,

178
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:31,685
I might not be able to control
my transformations anymore.

179
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,288
If I still can't win and
I have to take a third,

180
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,391
I might completely
lose consciousness.

181
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,358
Is it worth it?

182
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,628
I don't think I can
damage him without it.

183
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:49,603
I shall skewer you,
and roast you alive!

184
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,439
Shishi Kebab!

185
00:12:56,843 --> 00:13:01,748
Yoi! Yoi! Yoi!

186
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,757
I don't have time
to think this over.

187
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,157
Rumble!

188
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,828
It's a risk, but it's
the only chance I've got!

189
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,163
Yoyoi!

190
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,097
This is do or die.

191
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,031
One way or another,

192
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,366
I have to settle this
in three minutes!

193
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,035
Take this! Horn Point!

194
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,240
Yoyoi!

195
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,776
Uh-oh! Hot hot hot
hot hot hot hot hot!

196
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,612
Shishi-Kebab!

197
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,747
Take this! Jumping Point!

198
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,484
Wrong one!

199
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:51,198
Yoyoi! Ah, yoyoi!

200
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,302
Damn it. Just like I thought.

201
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,538
My transformations
are messed up.

202
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:02,109
All I need is to
get to Arm Point.

203
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:03,243
One shot with a cloven
hoof should be enough.

204
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:06,213
If this fire keeps spreading,
I'll end up suffocating.

205
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,182
I can't waste time
fighting this guy

206
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,050
when he doesn't even have a key!

207
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:14,455
That's right.
I have to find key #2.

208
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,524
Zoro and Sniper King
are counting on me!

209
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,694
We can't save Robin
without their help.

210
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,267
Robin. Hold on!

211
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,402
I won't let you down. I--

212
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,307
I'm here, to save my friend!

213
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,476
And I'm not gonna let
anybody get in my way!

214
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:40,047
You're a stubborn
beast, aren't you?

215
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,350
Life Return!

216
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,630
His hair is pointing
at me. Who cares!

217
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,566
I don't have time to
think, I have to win!

218
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,202
I can't let my friends down!

219
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,170
Shishi Finger Pistol!

220
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:55,789
Yoyoi! A lion shows no mercy!

221
00:15:55,822 --> 00:16:01,695
It's fury relents
for no creature!

222
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:08,068
I knew taking that second
rumble ball was a gamble,

223
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,471
but I was hoping it
wouldn't be this bad.

224
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,172
Since I have seven
different forms,

225
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,508
that means I only
have a 14% chance

226
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,243
of getting Arm Point.

227
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,180
But as long as I can move,

228
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,383
I'll try as many
times as it takes!

229
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,351
That's right.

230
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,787
I have to keep fighting!
Arm Point!

231
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,690
Shishi Kebab!

232
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,233
I can't let them down.

233
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:40,800
C'mon, Arm Point!

234
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,637
Yoyoi!

235
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,039
Arm Point!

236
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,573
Yoyoi!

237
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,476
Wrong again!

238
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,346
How many times is
this going to take?

239
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,782
My body's about
to give out on me.

240
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,451
I have to get Arm Point now!

241
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,152
Yoyoi!

242
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,456
Yoyoi!

243
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,826
I got it! When did that happen?

244
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,695
Prepare yourself!

245
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:11,298
My final attack.
It's all or nothing!

246
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:12,833
Cloven--

247
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,368
Shishi Finger Pistol!

248
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:24,411
This is my only chance.

249
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:28,181
I can't hold back! Cloven--!

250
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,517
Iron Body Strength!

251
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:33,587
Roseo Metel!

252
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,494
That has to do it!

253
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,063
That was my strongest attack!

254
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,711
Splendid!

255
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:05,285
A beautiful cherry
blossom blizzard.

256
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:11,625
Not yet. Not y--

257
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:16,363
Did I win?

258
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,105
You have awakened
the wrath of heaven!

259
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:31,011
Feel the thunder of the
lion's roar! Yoyoyoyoi!

260
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:38,084
Tempest Kick Lotus!

261
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,223
This is it.

262
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,392
I don't have the strength
to fight back anymore.

263
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,064
Chopper! Chopper!

264
00:18:50,097 --> 00:18:52,499
What in the world
did you do out there?

265
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,002
I don't remember.

266
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,775
"I don't remember"
isn't gonna cut it.

267
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,811
This is serious, you know.

268
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:06,213
You're lucky no one died.

269
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,815
While you've been here sleeping,

270
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,050
the whole country's
been in an uproar

271
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,686
about what you did last night.

272
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,588
What am I supposed to tell them?

273
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,225
I did something really bad, huh?

274
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,594
An entire village
almost got wiped out!

275
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,497
I know you love your experiments
just like your old man,

276
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,399
but you have to plan
these things very carefully

277
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,734
before you jump in!

278
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,535
Those are the rules.

279
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,672
A whole village wiped out?

280
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:34,742
I know you weren't
doing this just for fun

281
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:37,177
and I'm sure you
didn't mean any harm,

282
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,248
but, that's exactly why
you need to be more careful.

283
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,550
Much, much more careful.

284
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,424
We doctors walk
on a narrow cliff.

285
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,493
People entrust us
with their lives,

286
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,828
but even the tiniest
error on our parts

287
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,064
can prove fatal for them.

288
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:00,401
It doesn't matter if our
intentions are good or not.

289
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,670
So imagine what kind
of damage you could do

290
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,271
by being careless!

291
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,673
If you aren't willing to weigh

292
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,575
the consequences
of your actions,

293
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,144
then you have no
business being a doctor.

294
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,419
You wouldn't think it at first,

295
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:21,589
but you're the spitting
image of that crazy quack.

296
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,491
You can't help but
cause a ruckus, can you?

297
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,598
I suppose that even
bad seeds bear fruit,

298
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,299
now don't they?

299
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,169
I- I'm sorry.

300
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:38,539
Please Doctorine, I promise
I won't do it again,

301
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,308
so don't kick me out, okay?

302
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,110
You fool.

303
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:45,579
Just hurry up and
get better already.

304
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,181
These chores aren't
gonna do themselves.

305
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:56,590
Life Return! Hair Bind!

306
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,796
Suffer as you must,
but do not cry!

307
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:07,367
For if you shed a tear, thy
name as a man shall suffer, too.

308
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,236
He's going to kill me.

309
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,572
Far behind you is the
peaceful mountain village

310
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,440
where the cicadas sing.

311
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,277
The sweet memories leaping
in your heart have given way

312
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,613
to the dancing flames of
hell, licking at your feet

313
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,383
with every step of
your final journey.

314
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,287
I give to you the
leaves of a willow tree.

315
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,757
Dyed in crimson to
honor your parting.

316
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,225
Now take it!

317
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,560
Take it, take it
and never look back!

318
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,630
See the leaves
fluttering in red!

319
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:40,300
Song of the Willow!

320
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:46,540
This is the end. Robin.

321
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:50,043
No, I can't give up yet!

322
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,283
He escaped from the Hair Bind?

323
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,684
Rumble.

324
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,187
I'm sorry, Doctorine.

325
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,089
I can't keep my word.

326
00:22:02,122 --> 00:22:05,159
Maybe I am just like
the Doctor after all.

327
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:08,395
If he put his life on the
line to save his country,

328
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,265
then I want to put my life
on the line to save my friends.

329
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:16,437
If I'm going to die anyway.

330
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,272
I have to try it!

331
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,708
Everyone, please stay away.

332
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:23,443
I'm about to lose control.

333
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,116
I used three Rumble Balls.

334
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,684
And then, I don't know.

335
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:32,519
I lost consciousness.

336
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,188
What happened?

337
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:38,124
I suppose you could say
your Devil Fruit went wild.

338
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,361
I don't care what happens,

339
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:43,264
you can't let yourself
go down that path.

340
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,332
A power that destroys your foes,

341
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,201
but turns you
against your friends

342
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,103
and your own body as well.

343
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:52,439
There's only one word
for a creature like that.

344
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,645
A monster.

345
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,192
Big news, boss! Big, big news!

346
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,794
Oh yeah? Well calm down
and tell me about it.

347
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,362
We're back!

348
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,097
After all this time,
we're finally back!

349
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,365
Ah, but Buggy is back, too,

350
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,733
and he's making a mess
out of everything,

351
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,435
so we gotta hurry
and--and--and--

352
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:24,405
Okay, okay. I said
"calm down" didn't I?

353
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:27,741
Uh, right, well, the point is,
this is big news, boss!

354
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,075
On the next One Piece:

355
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,081
"Boss Luffy Returns!
Is it a dream or reality?
Lottery Ruckus."

356
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,616
I'm gonna be a policeman!
