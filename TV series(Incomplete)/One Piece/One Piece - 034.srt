Now we get to leave

[PURINPURIN] So this is
the infamous Arlong Park!

[PURINPURIN]
Listen up, men!

155

Our noble mission today
is one of extraction!

We must rescue the survivors
of the town of Gosa,

which was savagely destroyed
by the Arlong Pirates!

But I am left to wonder...

159
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,966
Would our brand of
swift and terrible justice

160
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,036
allow us to simply overlook
the decadent fortress

161
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,171

00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,501
[FISHMAN M] Oh, no!
The Marines have opened fire!

174
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,903
Arlong! Watch out!

175
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,515
Whoa. He crushed a cannonball.

176
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,217
Those jaws are terrifying!

177
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,190
So what now?
Are the talks...?

178
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,627
‐‐Canceled.

179
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,262
[FISHMAN M]
All right! Let's do it!

180
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,963
[FISHMAN I] I've been
waitin' for a good fight!

181
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,099
[FISHMAN E]
It's gonna be a bloodbath!

182
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,269
Choo. Hold on guys, not so fast.

183
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,439
There's no need
to expend so much energy

184
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,209
just to take out
the trash. Choo.

185
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,977
Just leave it to us!

186
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,980
What foolish humans they are
to pick a fight with us.

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,649
In our own waters, too.

188
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,484
Those Marines
don't stand a chance

189
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,119
against three of our leaders.

190
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,388
[laughs]
I doubt that ship will make it

191
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,958
a full three minutes!
[laughs]

192
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,760
[PURINPURIN]
That's odd.

193
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,396
[MARINE A] Commodore.
Seems that cannonball was a dud.

194
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,497
[PURINPURIN]
Fire another!

195
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,566
This is a signal
of open hostility!

196
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,168
Never drop your guard when
you're dealing with fishmen!

197
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,570
[MARINES]
Sir!

198
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,840
[MARINE A]
Man down!

199
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,076
[MARINE B]
It's one of them! Attack!

200
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,678
[PURINPURIN]
Stand down, right now!

201
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,681
One of Arlong's men, yes?

202
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:46,252
I am Commodore Purinpurin
of Marines branch number 77.

203
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,453
Allow me to elaborate.

204
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:51,324
You see we are a somewhat
well‐known elite marine unit.

205
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,693
Do you understand
what I'm telling you, fishman?

206
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,629
If you wish to live,
surrender immediately and‐‐

207
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,697
[MARINES]
Commodore!

208
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,333
‐‐What have you done to him?!
‐‐You killed him!

209
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,602
[MARINE B]
What's all this shaking?!

210
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,669
[MARINE D]
Don't tell me there are

211
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,371
fishmen under the ship!

212
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,044
[CHOO] I really am sorry to
inconvenience you like this,

213
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,647
but we just took the liberty
of removing your rudder.

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,715
Is that okay?

215
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,384
‐‐Uh! You what?
‐‐Commodore!

216
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,486
[CHOO]
Choo. Don't worry,

217
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,456
I didn't hit any
of his vital organs.

218
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,558
Commodore, I have a question.

219
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,660
It's just hypothetical
of course.

220
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,562
If one were to
move a large reef

221
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,497
directly into a strong current,

222
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,033
what do you suppose
would happen to the ocean?

223
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,401
[PURINPURIN]
What?!

224
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,474
No. Moving a whole reef?

225
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,410
That can't be done,
it's just not possible!

226
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,212
[KUROOBI]
Put it down over there, Hachi.

227
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,047
[HATCHAN]
Right!

228
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,582
[MARINE C]
Uh‐‐! Commodore!

229
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,417
[MARINE C] A giant whirlpool
has just appeared!

230
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,752
[MARINE D]
The rudder isn't working!

231
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,686
What?!

232
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,722
[CHOO] I told you.
We removed the rudder.

233
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,424
So now this rudderless ship

234
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,360
is headed straight... choo...

235
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,262
...to the sea floor.

236
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:10,770
[MARINES screaming]

237
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,582
They're dead.

238
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,788
That's right. And so is hope.

239
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,589
Time to face the truth.

240
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,559
There's no way to escape
Arlong's control.

241
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,381
I'll bet you're tired.

242
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,316
No, I didn't even
break a sweat.

243
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,818
We know everything
about these waters,

244
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,554
from the winds to the depths.
It was quite easy.

245
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,656
With our expert knowledge
of these waters,

246
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,391
no one can beat us.

247
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,394
True, but let's not
forget Nami's charts.

248
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,463
I checked those
before I moved the reef.

249
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,832
It even tells the flow
of current and everything!

250
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,434
Indeed. They are
excellent charts.

251
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,969
If we could persuade
Nami to do this

252
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,637
for all the world's oceans,

253
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,674
we would be the undisputed
rulers of the sea forever.

254
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,342
[ARLONG sighs]

255
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,010
I know. Nami's brilliant.

256
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,012
In fact, she could be
critical in the creation

257
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,682
of the Arlong Empire.
It's just a shame!

258
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,850
A shame?

259
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,352
[CHOO] He promised to let Nami
and Cocoyashi Village go

260
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,855
once she saves up
100 million berries.

261
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,656
Oh, no! Seriously?!

262
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,692
Whatever you do,
you can't let her leave!

263
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,928
You can't!
Say it ain't so, boss!

264
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,363
I have to!

265
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,533
That's was what we
agreed upon eight years ago!

266
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,368
I'm the kind of man
who will always

267
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,538
keeps my promises
when it comes to money.

268
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,340
Always.

269
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,510
[JOHNNY]
Hey! Big Bro Zoro!

270
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,779
What on Earth
are you thinking?! C'mon!

271
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,548
Did you forget that
Arlong is out to kill us?

272
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,116
We should be running away!

273
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,051
Now that we know
what Nami's really like,

274
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,720
there isn't a single
good reason why

275
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,622
we should stay on this island.

276
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,858
My reason for
staying here is there.

277
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,727
I'm staying 'cause he's staying.

278
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,396
[YOSAKU chuckles]
Don't be stupid, Big Bro Zoro!

279
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,732
Are you saying you want
to bring her back, too?

280
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,001
[ZORO] What I want
has nothing to do with this.

281
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:26,405
I don't decide who
the navigator is, he does.

282
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,073
Big Bro.

283
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,013
Right. Understood.
You're not leaving.

284
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,515
Sorry to cut our reunion short,
but I won't stay.

285
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,083
My role as guide ends here.

286
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,718
Yeah, I'm with him.

287
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,555
I don't want to deliberately
get myself killed.

288
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,724
Fine. I'll see ya around.

289
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,560
[JOHNNY]
Until we meet again, Big Bro!

290
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,094
[YOSAKU]
Take care you guys!

291
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,696
[ZORO]
You, too!

292
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,749
[snoring]

293
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,192
[SANJI]
Hey.

294
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,461
Well. What do you think it is?

295
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,796
Why was she crying?

296
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,898
[ZORO]
I don't know. Was she crying?

297
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,867
[SANJI]
She was in her heart.

298
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,602
Tch! If there were,

299
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,937
they were tears of guilt
for killing Usopp.

300
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,073
[SANJI]
Yeah, right. Are you serious?

301
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,808
You really are dense.

302
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,109
[ZORO]
Hm?

303
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:41,814
Do you still honestly believe
that Nami could've killed Usopp?

304
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,425
[USOPP]
When she did that...

305
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,597
[NAMI]
It's for my business.

306
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,100
This was my only choice.

307
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,070
[USOPP]
When she did that...

308
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,605
...Nami stabbed
her own hand

309
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,674
to make it look
like she stabbed me!

310
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,913
I can't believe
she did that for me!

311
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,180
But it's a good thing she did,

312
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,183
otherwise I'd be fish food
right now for sure!

313
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,785
But, what do I do?!

314
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,654
A manly man like me
can't just turn tail

315
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,689
and run after being saved!

316
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,924
One step at a time!

317
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,159
Right now I gotta hurry
and find Zoro!

318
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,628
Is that him up ahead?

319
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,097
It is! It's Zoro!

320
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,000
So Nami didn't kill him.
Is that what you're saying?

321
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,635
[SANJI]
Am I wrong?

322
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,103
Huh. Well who knows?

323
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,673
I always thought of her as
kind of a small time crook

324
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,609
who wouldn't even watch
a guy die, let alone kill him.

325
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,110
But maybe she just snapped.

326
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,946
Wait. What'd you say?

327
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,281
She's not small time!

328
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,883
[ZORO]
Is she all you think about?!

329
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,718
[USOPP groans]

330
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,523
‐‐[USOPP groans]
‐‐[SANJI] He's alive.

331
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,824
‐‐[USOPP groans]
‐‐[ZORO] Well, he was.

332
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,693
I hope he still is.

333
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,830
Usopp!

334
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,732
Did Nami do all this to you?!

335
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,834
Sorry. Zoro and I did that.

336
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,736
No, you did!

337
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,172
Luffy. You're here now.

338
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,707
Yep. Sure am.

339
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,742
I'm here, too. Hi there.

340
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,911
[USOPP] One of
these days I'll kill you.

341
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh! You just made
a full recovery!

342
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,081
[USOPP]
Shut up!

343
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,082
Oh, and by the way,

00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,250
we kinda heard you were dead.
Killed by Nami.

345
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,252
‐‐[USOPP] Huh?
‐‐Stupid Johnny!

346
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,822
He was spouting nonsense
that entire time!

347
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,926
Well, in a way...
it is the truth.

348
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,595
But, I'm alive...
'cause you see,

349
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,864
she actually saved my life.

350
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,775

[distant clanging]

352
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,191
Jeez, Nami. You sure know
how to trash a place.

353
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,360
Hey. What's wrong?

354
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,364
[NAMI] Nothing. I'm just
resting a little, that's all.

355
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,800
You mean to tell me that
pouring over a treasure map

356
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,304
after wrecking a house
is how you relax?

357
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,973
You're not fooling me.

358
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,809
Now fess up already.
What's bothering you?

359
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,112
[NAMI] Something happened
to make me mad. It's nothing.

360
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,647
[NOJIKO exhales]

361
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,983
Those guys? Who are they?

362
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,117
You know?

363
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,820
Yeah. I met some captain guy.

364
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,322
He seemed kind of
liar‐ish though.

365
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,326
Nami, I heard that
you smiled with them.

366
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,096
We both know
that's rare for you.

367
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,631
As a matter of fact,

368
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:49,234
I haven't seen you
smile in years.

369
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,671
C'mon. Tell me
who these guys are!

370
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,745
It's okay. You can
tell me anything, remember?

371
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:10,255
[NAMI] I had planned...
to forget about them.

♪

373
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,296
[NAMI] I thought I could
just erase them from my mind.

374
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,864
And I'm out!

375
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,167
Aw, man! You gotta be kidding!
How did you win again?

376
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,269
And Luffy, how come you have
so many cards in your hand?

377
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,772
I don't know.
Seems like more is better.

378
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,875
Idiot! Learn the rules
like everybody else!

[LUFFY]
All right, here's the rules!

380
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
The one with the most wins!

381
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,814
[NAMI] But the more I tried to
erase them...

382
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,316
...the more I remembered.

[LUFFY screaming]

384
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,820
Holy crap! We sprung a leak!

00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,122
[NAMI]
Hurry up and fix it!

386
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,723
[LUFFY]
Leave it to me guys!

387
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,394
[USOPP]
No! Stop flailing around!

00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,963

00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:57,069
[NAMI screaming]

390
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,372
[NAMI] The truth is,
when I was with them,

391
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,809
the only thing I forgot about
was the pain that I bear.

392
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,986
Don't you have any honor?!
Those men are your friends!

393
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,377
[NAMI] If it were possible,
I'd join up with those guys

394
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,779
and sail around the world.

395
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,422
Now I see.

396
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,091
Yeah, that would hit her hard.

397
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,395
To think that someone
actually showed up for her.

398
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,236
[NAMI]
Friends.

399
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:09,107
That word... means pain.

400
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,909
It breaks her heart.

401
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,385
So that's it. That's how
Nami pretended to kill me

402
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,621
and make sure I could
escape from Arlong Park.

403
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,823
Looks to me like she's got
some sorta hidden motive

404
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,459
for hangin' out with
a bunch of renegade fishmen.

405
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,728
‐‐Obviously.
‐‐Fine. What next?

406
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,496

[USOPP]
Whoa! Hang on just a second!

408
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,233
Don't you think
we'd better find out

409
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,734
what's going on with Nami first?

410
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,237
[NOJIKO]
It's no use either way.

411
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,504
[NOJIKO]
No matter what you guys do,

412
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,140

won't come to an end.

00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,276
[LUFFY]
Who's she?

415
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,744
Nami's big sister.

416
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,847
What?! Nami's sister.
No wonder she's so hot!

417
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,083
What do you mean that
"it's no use"?

00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,252
Just trust me.
Don't get yourselves involved

419

in what's going on here.
And leave poor Nami alone.

‐‐Situation?
‐‐Do you mean that you can

00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,761
tell us why she joined up
with Arlong's group?

423
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,763
[NOJIKO] Yeah. And if that
doesn't get you to leave,

424

‐‐Hey, wait!

Where are you going, Luffy?

00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,476

For a walk.

gonna listen to this?!

gonna change anything.

It's branch 16's ship!

is finally taking action

after what happened
to branch 77!

I'm Colonel Nezumi of branch 16.

Now then. Genzo please step up.
And make it snappy.

I'm the one you're looking for.

Take me to Nami's house at once!

I don't understand
what's going on, colonel.

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,683
Lead the way. That is
all you'll need to do.

From the beginning then.

Nami and I will never forget her
as long as we live.

It's not food!

It's the person
Nami will never forget!
