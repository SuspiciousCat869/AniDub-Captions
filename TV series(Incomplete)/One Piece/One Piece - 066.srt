00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,278
learns what happened here,

175
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,213
agents will be sent
after you immediately.

176
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,715
And since they're aware
that you've learned

177
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,284
the Boss's true identity,
you must‐‐

178
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,254
Yes, knowing them, they'll send
a thousand agents after me.

179
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,288
[NAMI whimpers]

180
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,289
Thus my plan.

181
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,259
Disguised like this,
I will pretend to be you.

182
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,461
I'll take these three
dummies on board with me

183
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,797
and I will sail a straight
course to Alabasta.

184
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,299
So these things are us?

185
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,300
[ZORO]
A decoy.

186
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,602
While Baroque Works is
busy chasing after me,

187
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,138
the rest of you will head
with Vivi to Alabasta Kingdom

188
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,473
following a less direct route.

189
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,308
[NAMI] Hold on just a second!

190
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,645
Who said we were gonna
take her with us?!

191
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,314
We still haven't discussed
the matter of payment.

192
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,417
Wait a second, payment
for what? Take her where?

193
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,319
[ZORO]
Where have you been, Luffy?

194
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,821
The old man here wants us to
take the princess back home

195
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,056
to her kingdom.

196
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,159
Oh. Is that what all this
yelling is about? Sure thing.

197
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,728
Crocodile may already
be after us!

198
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,398
Is this Crocodile guy
really that dangerous?

199
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,567
One of the Seven
Warlords of the Seas.

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,502
He is a legally
recognized pirate,

201
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,238
and because of that fact,
there is no bounty on his head.

202
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,776
However, long ago his bounty
was worth 80 million berries.

203
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,843
[ZORO]
Whoa.

204
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,479
Eighty million?! That's four
times Arlong's bounty!

205
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,948
There's no way!

206
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,649
Will you do this for us?

207
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,686
Sure. It sounds like
it'll be fun.

208
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,020
[IGARAM]
We are forever grateful.

209
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,628
Ma, ma, ma! Now I, Vivi,
will leave from here.

210
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,830
[LUFFY laughs]
Great imitation, old guy.

211
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,699
[ZORO]
Imitation of who?

212
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,704
[IGARAM] Princess, please
give me the eternal pose.

213
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,941
What's an eternal pose?

214
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,776
[IGARAM]
Hm? You've never heard of it?

215
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,979
You could say that it's sort
of like a permanent version

216
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,848
of the log pose. Whereas
a log pose will always

217
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,017
lead sailors to the next
island on the course,

218
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,053
an eternal pose will forever
remember the magnetic energy

219
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,989
of the island that is
stored inside of it.

220
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,726
So it will always point to
that island and none other.

221
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,663
And this eternal pose is
set to Alabasta Kingdom.

222
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,733
And you're going to use
this to set your course home?

223
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,803
Princess Vivi, please
take the indirect

224
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,905
island‐hopping route
to Alabasta.

225
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,074
I have never gone
that way myself,

226
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,644
but you should only have to
pass two or three islands

227
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,579
if you follow the log.

228
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,816
Please. Take care of the
princess in my absence.

229
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,717
Yeah.

230
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,019
[VIVI]
Igaram.

231
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,891
I expect that your journey is
going to be a difficult one.

232
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,326
Please be careful.

233
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,194
Iga‐‐

234
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,836
See you soon.

235
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,943
[IGARAM] May we meet again
safely in our homeland.

236
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,785
[IGARAM] It's up to you to
save our country, Princess.

237
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,420
And off he goes.

238
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,022
Ha, ha! He was such
a funny old man.

239
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:34,026
What's more. He's a very
reliable old man.

240
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,982
[LUFFY gasping]

241
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,420
[NAMI]
Oh, no!

242
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:10,329
[NAMI] They're already after us?
That's impossible!

243
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,106
[LUFFY yells]

244
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,407
Nami, the log!

245
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,843
[NAMI] Uh, we're fine.
It's all set.

246
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,312
Get the girl, come on. Let's go!

247
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,580
[NAMI]
Vivi!

248
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:33,085
We have to leave. If they get us
now, it'll all be for nothing.

249
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,086
[NAMI gasps]

250
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,823
Don't worry. We are going
to get you home.

251
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,960
I know they don't look like
much, but they're strong.

252
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,764
They saved the East Blue!
Just the four of them!

253
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,932
Baroque Works?
Give me a break!

254
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,202
Crocodile...? Ha!

255
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:53,038
Those guys are the ones
who should be worried!

256
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,489
[LUFFY panting]

257
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,994
[USOPP]
Ahh!

258
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,495
Come on!

259
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,465
[USOPP]
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

260
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,735
[SANJI] Hey, what the hell are
you doing Luffy?! Stop it!

261
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,569
What's going on?!

262
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,037
[USOPP]
My nose is gonna fall off!

263
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,741
[SANJI] I said let go,
damn it! Put me down!

264
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,075
Hurry, Vivi!

265
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,844
[VIVI]
Coming!

266
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,814
[VIVI]
Karoo isn't here!

267
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,989
A decoy? That's almost cute.

268
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,892
[LUFFY]
Hey! I've got 'em!

269
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,928
[ZORO] Bring 'em up.
We're ready to go!

270
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,265
What? They're still asleep.

271
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,334
[NAMI] We don't have
time to look for him!

272
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,436
[VIVI] I'm not going
to just leave him here!

273
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,204
[NAMI]
But listen!

274
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,171
[ZORO]
Hey, what's the problem?

275
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,941
[NAMI] Apparently her
duck's gone missing!

276
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:06,011
And now she's refusing
to leave without him!

277
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:06,512
[ZORO]
This duck?

278
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,179
[KAROO squawks]

279
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:07,947
[NAMI, VIVI]
He's here?!

280
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,915
[ZORO]
Made it here before I did.

281
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,584
[VIVI] There's a tributary
just up the river.

282
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,220
If we take it, we can
get out to sea faster.

283
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,022
[LUFFY]
All right! Let's go!

284
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,958
[ZORO]
Hey.

285
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,960
[VIVI]
Mister Bushido.

286
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,062
How many people do you
think Baroque Works

287
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,864
will send after us?

288
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,298
I'm not sure.

289
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,968
I know that there are about
2,000 loyal employees

290
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,536
in Baroque Works, and
I've heard that there are

291
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,273
several bases like this one
that are set up in the area.

292
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,208
They really might send
a thousand people?!

293
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,977
[SANJI]
What? Huh?

294
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,879
[USOPP]
Hey! The ship's leaving!

295
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,313
You're finally awake.

296
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,582
Hold on a second, can't we
stay just one more night?!

297
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,550
One night!

298
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,485
This town's full of
amazingly cute girls!

299
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,988
Who knows if we'll ever
have this much fun again?!

300
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,990
Even pirates deserve a vacation!

301
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,558
Come on, it's not
even morning yet!

302
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,828
We should have just left
'em behind. Jeez.

303
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,497
[ZORO] Nami! Will you
explain it to them?

304
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,465
[NAMI]
I just did.

305
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,433
[ZORO]
Okay, that was fast.

306
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,169
[NAMI] I left out
the complicated parts.

307
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,006
[VIVI] We should be
reaching the sea soon.

308
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,475
[LUFFY]
Hey, cool! Look at all the fog.

309
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,977
[NAMI]
Finally, it's getting light out.

310
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,513
[MS. ALL SUNDAY] I'm just glad
we got away from the people

311
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,581
who were chasing us.

312
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,349
That's for sure.

313
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,584
[MS. ALL SUNDAY]
With all this fog,

314
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,086
we need to be careful
to avoid the rocks.

315
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,922
I'll take care of it.

316
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,425
Wait... did you...

317
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,093
[LUFFY]
Uh. No.

318
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,461
[NAMI chuckles nervously]

319
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,530
This ship is nice.

320
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,298
[NAMI yelps]

321
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,332
[gasps]

322
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,936
What?! Who's that?

323
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,505
It's... It's you!

324
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,706
[MS. ALL SUNDAY chuckles]

325
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,780
I just happened to run into your
dear Mr. 8 a little ways back.

326
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,982
He didn't look so good.

327
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,884
So you killed Igaram!

328
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,118
You?!

329
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,055
What are you doing on my ship,
and how did you get here?

330
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,022
Who are you?

331
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:57,990
[VIVI]
Answer him!

332
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,194
What are you doing here?!
Ms. All Sunday!

333
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,864
So you know who she is?

334
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,367
Which of the number guys
is she partnered with?

335
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,669
[VIVI]
Her partner is Mr. 0.

336
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,870
The Boss.

337
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,006
Ah! Crocodile's her partner!

338
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,207
She's a bad guy?

339
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,243
[VIVI] She was the only one
who knew the Boss's identity.

340
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,313
That's how we found out
who he actually is.

341
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,215
By following her back to him.

342
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,385
To be accurate, I allowed it.

343
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,053
So she's a good guy then.

I know you knew we were there.

the Boss what we knew.

would take to help her country,

You don't want me to come
up there and take it!

You are a bad person! I
demand you leave this instant!

Bad luck, picking up a
princess who Baroque Works

has already made up their
mind to see eliminated.

handful of pirates.

But your luck gets even worse,

You see...

...the name of the
next island is Little Garden.

We won't even need
to lift a finger.

You'll all be dead long
before you reach Alabasta.

My hat! Give it to me!

395

[USOPP] I told you to
leave now, evil... doer!

[ZORO]
Evil doer... Seriously?

397
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,480
You don't think
it's a little foolish,

398
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,982
allowing yourselves
to be wiped out?

399
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,484

Using that,

402
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,490
you can just skip right past
Little Garden without stopping.

403
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,059
Straight to an island
near Alabasta.

404
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,829
The pose points to a place
known as Nanimoniashima.

405
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,331
None of our agents
know that course,

406
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,333
so you won't be followed.

I don't want to accept a gift
from someone like her.

But these people have
taken me on their ship...

went out of her way

to help us get away!

through her head.

thinking about it, is there?
