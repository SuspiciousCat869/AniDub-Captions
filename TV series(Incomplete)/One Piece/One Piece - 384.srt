00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,827
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,365
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:50,637
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,439
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,843
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,879
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,416
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,519
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:10,123
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,461
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

48
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,931
It certainly is a
calm night, isn't it?

49
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,233
I've been on watch,
but nothing has happened.

50
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,435
So peaceful and quiet.

51
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,605
If I'm not careful, I might
fall asleep at the wheel.

52
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,574
This is what they
call "smooth" sailing,

53
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,841
no bones about it.

54
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,644
Though in my case,
I'm nothing but bones.

55
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,746
Yohohoho!

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,849
So bored.

57
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,588
Laboon.

58
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,190
Now I've joined
the Straw Hat Crew,

59
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,859
but I'm still making my way
back to you bit by bit.

60
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,229
Yohohoho!

61
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,532
You've met them.
They're good people.

62
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,835
And what's more,
I've discovered something.

63
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,538
Earlier today, I came across
a wonderful little treasure

64
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,939
they had hidden away.

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,579
[BROOK] It was a journal
recounting all the tales

66
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,981
of the crew's struggles,

67
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,451
their battles, and their
amazing adventures together.

68
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,419
And now, as their comrade,

69
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,288
I will become a
part of those tales.

70
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,423
I'll strive to be an
indispensable member

71
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,591
of the crew!

72
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,227
I shall do my best, Laboon!

73
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,662
Have faith!

74
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,797
[BROOK]
Good morning, everybody!

75
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,867
And now, a little something
to help start your day!

76
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,969
[BROOK (SONG)]
♪ It's a White Handkerchief!

00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,537

The sun's not even up yet!

00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,575
[FRANKY] Come on!
I'm trying to get some sleep!

80
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,609
[NAMI]
Forget about Brook.

81
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,245
Someone stop Luffy's snoring!

82
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,648
[LUFFY]
Brook's Great Struggle!

83
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,984
Is the Path to Becoming
a True Comrade Rigorous?

84
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,424
[seagulls cawing]

85
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,726
[FRANKY] We're not getting
anywhere in these calm waters.

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,862
So, if you like, Miss Navigator,

87
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,997
I can switch over
to paddles instead.

88
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,198
I don't think that's necessary.

89
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,968
Based on the weather, I'd say
we'll have wind tomorrow.

90
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:02,769
[FRANKY]
That works.

91
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,837
No need to waste
my precious cola.

92
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,506
[BROOK]
Yoho!

93
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,640
Yummy!

94
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,909
Sanji's food is the best!
I can't get enough of it!

95
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,411
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

96
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,613
Robin, dear,

97
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,882
would you care for seconds
on the seafood salad?

98
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,949
Yes, thank you.

99
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,551
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

100
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,054
Hey. What's wrong, Brook?

101
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,790
You've been acting all
creepy since you woke us up.

102
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,359
Did you see something
cool while you were on watch?

103
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,060
What was it?

104
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,294
While he was making his rounds

105
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,830
and keeping an eye on things,
he found our voyage journal.

106
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,098
Yes! That's right!

107
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,335
I happened to stumble across it
and couldn't help taking a peek!

108
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,836
To be honest, I was amazed!

109
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,071
Shocked, even!

110
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,939
[BROOK] My excitement after
what happened at Thriller Bark

111
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,040
had yet to subside.

112
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,310
But for you, that was merely
the tip of the iceberg!

113
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,079
You were responsible
for stopping a civil war

114
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,513
in Alabasta!

115
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,748
Your adventure on Skypeia,

116
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,351
a place thought by many to be
nothing more than a legend!

117
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,353
You made yourselves enemies
of the World Government

118
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,722
at Water 7 and Enies Lobby!

119
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,423
I got so excited
reading about it,

120
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,425
I thought my heart would pop!

121
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,894
Well, that is,
if I actually had a heart!

122
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,831
Yohohoho!

123
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,332
I see.

124
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,767
But now that we're headed
to the New World,

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,402
I wonder what we'll
write about next?

126
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,937
Everything that's
happened since we met Brook

127
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,106
will be added to the
journal, too, right?

128
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,907
[BROOK]
Precisely my concern!

129
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,009
Since you helped me and
I've become your comrade,

130
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,079
I don't feel I've done anything
useful to help you in return!

131
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,049
I understand why you're
so worked up, but take it easy.

132
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,450
Now that you're
part of our crew,

133
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,486
let me give you
a little piece of advice.

134
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,755
I shall listen carefully.
Thank you.

135
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,591
You must never, ever let
your guard down during a meal.

136
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,725
Not even for a second.

137
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,493
Right!

138
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,694
Understood, Nami!

139
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,095
I shall be ever vigilant!

140
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,830
When an enemy attacks,
"Quick Draw Brook"

141
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,832
will be there
to save the day!

142
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,100
It looks like you're
a little too late

143
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,702
to save this one.

144
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,970
C'mere, food!

--[BROOK] Yohoho!
--[LUFFY] Yummy!

148
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,012
Not as "ever vigilant"
as I said I'd be.

149
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,046
Nonetheless!

150
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,815
I will do whatever it takes
to prove my worth

151
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,784
as your new comrade
and crewmate.

152
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,685
I shall work myself to the bone!

153
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,422
Though I'm nothing
but bones to start with.

154
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,825
[BROOK]
Thank you, Sanji!

155
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,093
[SANJI]
No, thank you.

156
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,096
The less time I spend cooped up
in here washing those dishes,

157
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,733
the faster I can finish making
this tea and deliver it to Nami.

158
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,168
I'm looking forward
to proving my worth

159
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,803
when the chips
are down in battle.

160
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,838
But in the meantime,
I'll do my best to help out

161
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,072
in every little
way possible.

162
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,142
No matter the task, I want you
to know you can count on me!

163
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,944
Gotta admit,
that's a nice attitude.

164
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,447
I've washed so much,
my skin's getting all prune-y.

165
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,116
If I had any skin!
Yohohoho!

166
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:30,917
[SANJI]
All right.

167
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,852
I'm off to take
this tea to Nami.

168
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,487
Oh! Before you go...

169
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,622
Where should I put these?

170
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,124
Ah. Right over there.

171
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,895
If you drop 'em,
you're dead!

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,096
I'm doing my best not to!

173
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,466
But either way,
I'm already dead!

174
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,467
Bone!

175
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,168
[SANJI]
Don't say "bone"!

176
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,436
[SANJI]
Hold this!

177
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,678
Magnificent!

178
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,213
[SANJI] Don't say
"magnificent", either!

179
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,981
Why did I let you
wash the dishes?

180
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,850
Well, since your
hands are now full,

181
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,651
I'll take this tea
out to Nami myself.

182
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,652
[SANJI]
Get back here, dammit!

183
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,187
I wanted to do that!

184
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,193
[BROOK]
Oh, Nami.

185
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,828
I've brought you your tea.

186
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,463
[NAMI]
Come in.

187
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,464
And, while I'm here,

188
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,234
would you be so kind as
to show me your panties?

189
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,102
No! Stop asking me!

190
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,171
Oh.

191
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,106
Your map, huh? Updating?

192
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,709
Yeah. We've been
pretty busy lately.

193
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,879
And since the ship isn't moving,
it's a great chance to catch up.

194
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,948
If I remember correctly,

195
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,851
it's your dream to draw a map
of the world, isn't it?

196
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,754
Yep, I'm going to travel
across every ocean of the world

197
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,890
and draw this map
from what I see firsthand

198
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,658
with my own two eyes.

199
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,226
What a superb dream!

200
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,029
If there's anything at all I can
do to help fulfill your goal,

201
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,031
please do not
hesitate to ask me.

202
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,600
But in the meantime, would
you care for some more tea?

203
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,801
Yes, thank you.

204
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,537
For now, the thought
is more than enough.

205
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,104
Really.

206
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:58,971
You're such an amazing

207
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,207
and deeply
considerate person, Nami!

208
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,808
Nothing short of an angel!

209
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,643
Oh, stop.

210
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,011
You're embarrassing me!

211
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,013
No! It's the honest truth!

212
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,115
[BROOK]
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

213
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,116
Oh no! Are you okay?

214
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:10,983
Yes, thanks.

215
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,753
Wow. I almost
burnt my finger. Ouch.

216
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,056
Wait. That's impossible because
I don't have any skin to burn.

217
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,125
Yohohoho!

218
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,027
[NAMI]
Agh! My map!

219
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,694
Oh, my goodness!

220
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,130
I can't believe I did that!

221
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,565
Don't you worry!

222
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,966
There, good as new right?

223
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,701
There's no need to thank me.

224
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,103
[NAMI] Oh, yeah,
that's good as new.

225
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,706
Get out before I kill you!

226
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
[BROOK]
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

227
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,283
[BROOK] So far,
I haven't helped anyone.

228
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,152
In fact, I've caused
nothing but trouble.

229
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:46,886
Hey!

230
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,788
Hey, Brook!

231
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,189
[BROOK]
Yes, what is it?

232
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,390
I think Franky and Usopp

233
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,693
are about to do
something totally awesome.

234
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,761
You should come up here
and check it out!

235
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,997
Uh, okay.

236
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,199
[BROOK] What are
you doing, Chopper?

237
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,068
Taking advantage
of this nice sunshine

238
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,870
to dry out some
of my medicinal herbs.

239
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,207
Franky's got some kinda
new weapon he wants to try out.

240
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,043
All right!

241
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,045
Now that she's fueled up
with some cola,

242
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,148
it's time to unleash the high
power Super Franky Cannon!

243
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,050
It's way better
than a regular cannon.

244
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,820
It's the state of the art
in cola-powered weaponry.

245
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,722
[USOPP] Pair this cannon
with a masterful sniper

246
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,323
and weapons expert
such as me,

247
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,292
and you've got yourself
a lethal combination!

248
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,160
Amazing! I'm so excited!

249
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,428
My heart's beating so fast!

250
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,163
Mine, too!

251
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,931
If there's anything,

252
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,366
anything I can do
to help out,

253
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,500
please just ask me.

254
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,501
Hey, I know.

255
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,803
Why don't you grab us
another barrel of cola,

256
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,138
just to be on the safe side?

257
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,307
[BROOK] What a simple
request! I'm on it!

258
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,944
Yohohoho!
Yoho, yohohohoho!

259
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,946
[BROOK]
This must be it.

260
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,915
Your cola has arrived!

261
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,483
[FRANKY]
Super.

262
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,984
Just add it to the tank.

263
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,019
[BROOK]
Right!

264
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,788
Our target is that
outcrop right over there.

265
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,289
All right! You got it!

266
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,058
[USOPP]
Locking in on the target!

267
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,794
Fire!

268
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,995
Here we go!

269
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,231
Yoho!

270
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:09,502
What happened?

271
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,302
Now that's weird.

272
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,304
Try increasing
the cola pressure!

273
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,339
Sure thing.

274
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,280
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's
not supposed to happen.

275
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,317
Hit the deck!

276
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,123
Nice going!

277
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,958
That test run
almost got us killed!

278
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,460
I don't know
what happened!

279
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,398
This cola's sure salty.

280
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,335
It's like cola,
but not at all.

281
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,938
It tastes a lot
like soy sauce to me.

282
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,842
[BROOK] What is it?
What's wrong?

283
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,976
It'll tell you what's wrong,

284
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,079
that thick skull of yours
mixed up the cola barrels

285
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,346
and the soy sauce barrels!

286
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,182
Ah! So I did!

287
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,317
I guess that's what
caused the explosion!

288
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,285
What a mistake!

289
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,986
I am so sorry!

290
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,055
[FRANKY]
You moron!

291
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,523
You think this is funny,
you little punk?

292
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,094
Aw, man!
That skeleton's hilarious!

293
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,229
Now I'm soaked to
the skin in soy sauce.

294
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,030
Yech.

295
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,065
My medicinal herbs
are soaked, too.

296
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,200
Guess I'll wipe them down.

297
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,301
Hey!

298
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,269
This meat tastes even better
with all this soy sauce!

299
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,971
Way to go!

300
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,573
[USOPP]
Always "Mr. Brightside".

301
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,277
[BROOK] Every single thing I've
done today has backfired on me.

302
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,814
Uh, Zoro, what are you doing?

303
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,862
I shouldn't just be
sitting here admiring him!

304
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:43,929
I, too, am a swordsman!

305
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,498
I should act like one!

306
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,268
[BROOK]
Ah, meditation.

307
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,937
You control your mental state

308
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,140
and clear your mind
of distractions.

309
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,575
I shall accompany you
in this endeavor.

310
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,213
[BROOK]
Uhm, Zoro?

311
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,917
I know it's not appropriate to
speak at a time like this,

312
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,585
so I shouldn't disturb you
with unnecessary questions,

313
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,987
but, uh...

314
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,155
I don't care. What is it?

315
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,422
[BROOK]
Well, the thing is, uh...

316
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,557
Just spit it out!

317
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,591
My apologies,

318
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,360
but I'm afraid that I need
to go the bathroom.

319
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,028
You don't need my
permission for that!

320
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,229
Just go and do it already!

321
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,564
I would, but...

322
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,466
My legs fell asleep
and now I can't get up!

323
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,467
You don't have any muscle!

324
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,501
How can that happen?

325
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,569
Listen to me!

326
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,571
Any second now, it's gonna
leak right out of me!

327
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,072
No! Don't do it here!

328
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,275
Hold on! Hold on!
I'll take you!

329
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,043
[ZORO] Hang on!
You can make it!

330
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,080
No matter how much I try,

331
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,349
all I do is irritate everyone.

332
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,151
Oh, whatever shall I do?

333
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,421
[BROOK]
Hello, Robin!

334
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,256
So, uh...

335
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,959
I don't suppose that you have
anything I can help you with,

336
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,260
do you?
Anything at all?

337
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,962
Nothing in particular.

338
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,232
I assumed as much.

339
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,166
Tell me, Brook.

340
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,435
What has you so troubled today?

341
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,503
[BROOK]
Troubled?

342
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,006
It seems to me like
you're afraid of something.

343
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,408
Am I mistaken?

344
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,176
Yes. Indeed.

345
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,045
It's exactly as you say.

346
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,179
I am troubled.

347
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,983
I'm horribly afraid and
uneasy and all of those things!

348
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,420
[BROOK] When Luffy first
invited me to join this crew,

349
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,521
I was overjoyed.

350
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,690
I couldn't believe it.

351
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,227
His kindness,
it made me so happy.

352
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:23,662
[BROOK]
And back on Thriller Bark,

353
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,031
when we defeated
Oars together,

354
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,300
I felt such pride.

355
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,071
So does the offer to
join your crew still stand?

356
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,172
Yeah, welcome aboard.

357
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,274
[SANJI and USOPP]
What?

358
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,342
But now,

359
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,378
I wonder if it truly was
all right for me to join.

360
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,480
We're setting sail
towards the New World.

361
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,649
I've no doubt we'll
encounter dangerous foes

362
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,985
the likes of which
we've never seen.

363
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,386
What would happen if I--

364
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,222
If it turned out I couldn't
be of any help to anyone?

365
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,491
That I was only holding
all of you back?

366
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,028
I would feel obligated
to leave the ship.

367
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,064
[BROOK] I wouldn't deserve
to be among this crew.

368
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,568
I'd have no choice but to return
to the way I was living before.

369
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,404
Alone, year after year.

370
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,739
An eternity of solitude,

371
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,641
surrounded by nothing
but the waves.

372
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,675
[ROBIN]
I see.

373
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,454
I once felt the
exact same way.

374
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:33,248
[ROBIN]
I see.

375
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,886
I once felt the
exact same way.

376
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,957
I feared I wasn't good
enough to be their friend,

377
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,226
or to even be
a part of this crew.

378
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,196
That's why I was willing to
throw my life away to save them.

379
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,064
I thought it was the one
way I could be worthy

380
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,167
of their kindness,
loyalty, and friendship.

381
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,836
Oh, Robin, no.

382
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,473
Even now,
no matter how far we sail,

383
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,409
there's an enemy that
haunts me at every turn!

384
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:05,114
Because I'm facing the
world and all of its darkness.

385
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,081
Understand?

386
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,250
That's why I didn't
want you to rescue me!

387
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,386
If that's the
only future I have,

388
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,956
I'd rather die
to save me the pain!

389
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,892
I can't believe you would
think something like that.

390
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:17,893
Well, I did.

391
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,429
But soon after,
I realized I'd made a mistake.

392
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,264
Judging your worth
through others' eyes

393
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,500
isn't what friendship's about.

394
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,902
What do you mean by that?

395
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:27,870
Think about it.

396
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,972
I'm sure you'll find
the answer soon enough.

397
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:34,276
Hey, Brook!

398
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,077
It's time to eat!

399
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,112
--Food, food, food!
--Oh, Luffy.

400
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:38,113
Sanji went all out on this one!

401
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:39,982
We've been collecting
a buncha awesome stuff

402
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:42,851
from the waters here
and he made a big feast!

403
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:43,919
Luffy, wait!

404
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,922
Why are you
just standing there?

405
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,424
Come on! Food time!

406
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,826
Do you really think
I'm good enough

407
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,128
to be a part of this crew?

408
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:56,131
Do I honestly have what it takes
to be a Straw Hat Pirate?

409
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,332
[LUFFY]
Yep.

410
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:58,534
You didn't even
think about it!

411
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,069
I was asking a serious question!

412
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,271
I decided you should join
and then you said yes.

413
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,138
It's fine!

414
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,540
[BROOK]
Huh?

415
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,842
[chuckling]

416
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:10,879
Forget about that, okay?

417
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:11,980
Come on! It's time to eat!

418
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,283
Everyone's waiting for us!

419
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,918
Even an adventurous
crew like this one

420
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,521
deserves a calm and
relaxing day now and then.

421
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,069
[LUFFY]
Come on, Usopp!

422
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,237
Let's catch some dinner!

423
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:43,272
[USOPP]
Yeah!

424
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,475
[BROOK]
How many years--

425
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:47,709
No--

426
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,579
How many decades has it been
since I could just sit around

427
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:55,450
and take an afternoon nap in the
sun without a care in the world?

428
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,286
[RUMBAR PIRATE 380J]
C'mon, Brook, wake up!

429
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,687
Get with a program already!

430
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,354
[RANDOM RUMBAR PIRATE 380I]
Yeah pal!

431
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,123
Look! We sighted an island!

432
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:01,990
[RANDOM RUMBAR PIRATE 380J]
It's a summer island!

433
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:03,992
Check out the beach!

434
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,961
[BROOK]
While I wandered the seas alone,

435
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:09,097
I would lay my head down, not
knowing if it was day or night

436
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:12,634
and dream of my long lost
comrades and Laboon.

437
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,506
[BROOK] However, it was
precious little solace.

438
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,074
For when I awoke,
the fleeting joy

439
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,210
became oppressive loneliness.

440
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,479
Yet what could I do
but repeat the cycle again?

441
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:25,714
[BROOK]
In those days,

442
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:29,718
I could find peace neither in
slumber nor my waking hours.

443
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,488
But now, if I
listen carefully...

444
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:48,370
Oh, wow!
Look at that one, Robin!

445
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,571
Isn't it cute?

446
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,539
It is.

447
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:51,974
I think anything on this page

448
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,275
would look beautiful
on you, Nami.

449
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,978
I was thinking
exactly the same thing!

450
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:30,779
[snoring]

451
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,614
[stomach growling]

452
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:44,426
[BROOK] I can hear my new
friends all around me.

453
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:49,331
I know I died, and am now
nothing but bones, but...

454
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:52,534
...I'm so very happy
to still be alive.

455
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:16,825
[violin playing 'Binks' Brew']

456
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,061
[violin continues]

457
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:04,740
[snoring]

458
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:10,512
[BROOK] I've no doubt
that this time of quiet

459
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:13,815
will soon be replaced by the
roaring sounds of adventure,

460
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,685
a prospect I welcome
wholeheartedly.

461
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:20,655
But now, it's a moment
to rest one's bones.

462
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:22,791
Yohohoho!

463
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:26,461
[BROOK]
Laboon.

464
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:28,463
It seems that the
next time we meet,

465
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:32,134
I'll have quite a few stories
to share, old friend.

466
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,904
Until then,
I'll keep dreaming of you,

467
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,707
and I hope you'll
keep waiting for me.

468
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,421
[FRANKY] Look at that.
Finally got some wind.

469
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,256
Oh, hello.

470
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,227
Listen up!

471
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:03,131
It's time to get moving!

472
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,434
[ALL]
Yeah!

473
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,768
[BROOK]
You can count on me!

474
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,337
I'll give you my blood,
sweat and tears,

475
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,641
though I don't have any of those
things, being a skeleton.

476
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,183
[LUFFY] We finally
reached The Red Line!

477
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,684
[ROBIN]
Home of Fishman Island!

478
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:25,720
[SANJI] Mermaids!
Where are the mermaids?

479
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:26,922
[ROBIN]
I don't see any mermaids,

480
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,657
but there is a sea king.

481
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,392
[LUFFY]
That jerk! Wait--

482
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,494
Something popped out
when I whacked its stomach.

483
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,496
[SANJI] Hold on! Is that
what I think it is?

484
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,231
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

485
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:38,200
"Halfway Across the Grand Line!

486
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,202
Arrival at the Red Line!"

487
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,504
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
