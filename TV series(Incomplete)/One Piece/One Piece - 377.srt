1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,907
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,777
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,914
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:49,953
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,923
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:57,160
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:59,762
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:03,233
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,302
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,772
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,947
[ZORO] Thirty-Six
Caliber Phoenix!

48
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:22,385
He deflected Zoro's
attack with his bare hand!

49
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:25,321
I think I just figured
out what your ability is.

50
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:31,127
I possess the power
to deflect anything I wish.

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,032
You see, I ate the Paw Paw Fruit
and became a Paw-Palmed Human.

52
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,101
[FRANKY]
What the hell is he doing?

53
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,535
[NAMI]
Is that air?

54
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,805
It looks like a giant
bubble shaped like a paw.

55
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,074
[CHOPPER] And he keeps
making it smaller.

56
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,511
I think I know
what he's doing.

57
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,314
He's using his power to
deflect a giant air mass,

58
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,083
but he's compressing it
into a tiny ball.

59
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,185
The real attack will come

60
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,255
as soon as he releases all
of that compressed pressure.

61
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,323
That much air...

62
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:02,225
It'll send out a
massive shock wave.

63
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,060
Like an enormous bomb.

64
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,798
Did... I hear you right?

65
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,236
Like a bomb?

66
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,239
You mean he's gonna release
that and blow us all up?

67
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,574
This is bad.

68
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:34,157
I've thought it over
and I've made a decision.

69
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,192
I will spare your lives.

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,562
But on one condition.

71
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,898
In exchange for this
act of magnanimity,

72
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,934
you give me the head
of Straw Hat Luffy.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,342
If I return with him,

74
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
that should be enough
to satisfy the government.

75
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,916
We won't betray
our own captain!

76
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,051
[KUMA]
Now, then.

77
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,620
Hand him over
before I change my mind.

78
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,158
[CREW]
Never!

79
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,904
This was your choice.

80
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,342
[LUFFY] "The Pain of
My Crewmates is My Pain!

81
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,378
Zoro's Desperate Fight!"

82
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:48,297
Now suffer the Ursa Shock.

83
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,417
[ZORO]
Lion's Song!

84
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,933
[ZORO] Of course.
I should've known.

85
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,380
So you're a cyborg
like Franky, huh?

86
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,684
Not quite. You're made of
something tougher than he is.

87
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,488
That steel bar.
He melted it.

88
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,339
[KUMA] A cyborg? I suppose
you could say that.

89
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,343
But my metal parts
are all I have in common

90
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,045
with your friend Franky.

91
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,091
[KUMA] I'm a creation
known as a Pacifista,

92
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:09,061
an in-development human-weapons
project of the World Government.

93
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,264
A Pacifista, huh?

94
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,043
[KUMA]
I was created

95
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,378
by the Government's
most renowned scientist,

96
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,546
Doctor Vegapunk.

97
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,350
One of the greatest geniuses
this world has ever known.

98
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,085
To put that
into perspective,

99
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,087
his discoveries
are so sophisticated

100
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,489
that it's believed
it will take the rest

101
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,126
of the world 500 years
to catch up to him.

102
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,096
Technology that advanced,
and you have Devil Fruit powers?

103
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,633
I'm starting to think you
have an advantage over me.

104
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,737
[ZORO]
Well, this is embarrassing.

105
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,240
My body's shutting down.

106
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,775
It won't listen to me anymore.

107
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,148
[ZORO] And the only
way you'll back down

108
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,450
is if we give you Luffy's head?

109
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,818
[ZORO coughs]

110
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,088
That is the only compromise
I'm willing to offer.

111
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,468
You want a head?

112
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,403
Then I'll give you a head.

113
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,741
However, I can't give
you my captain's.

114
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,243
You'll have to
take mine instead.

115
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,412
Please settle for that.

116
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,549
[ZORO] I may not
have the same bounty

117
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,684
on my head as
Luffy at the moment,

118
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,719
but I swear to you
that I'm destined

119
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,290
to become the greatest swordsman
the world has ever known.

120
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,725
Surely that must
be worth something.

121
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,162
[KUMA] You possess
that much ambition,

122
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,598
and yet you're
willing to give it all up

123
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,734
and exchange your life for his.

124
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,636
[ZORO]
The way things are lookin',

125
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,173
I don't see any other way
to save the rest of my crew.

126
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,508
What's the point
of having ambition

127
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,710
if I can't even save my captain?

128
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,281
Luffy is the man who'll
become King of the Pirates!

129
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,376
[SANJI] Real cute.
Stop trying to show me up.

130
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,915
[SANJI] Ya got the right idea,
but what about your dream?

131
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,318
Ya can't accomplish
anything if you're dead,

132
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,887
ya stubborn fool.

133
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,356
Don't tell me...

134
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,361
[SANJI]
Listen, ya giant oaf.

135
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,662
[ZORO]
Hey!

136
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,464
Don't bother with
moss head here.

137
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,532
If you're takin'
a head, take mine.

138
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,935
The government
might not consider me

139
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,837
a serious threat right now,

140
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,939
but you'll regret not
taking my head over his

141
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,375
once I start making trouble.

142
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,244
Now's your chance to
take on Black Leg Sanji.

143
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,747
[ZORO]
You jackass!

144
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,190
Go on and get it over with.

145
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,361
The only head
you're taking is mine.

146
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,330
Forget about these fools.

147
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,231
Kill me and get outta here.

148
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,875
[SANJI] I'm just as ready
to sacrifice myself as he is.

149
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:45,713
I've fed people my whole life,
and now I'll feed the worms.

150
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:52,319
[SANJI]
Hey. Do me a favor.

151
00:16:54,788 --> 00:16:57,324
[SANJI] Tell everyone I'm
sorry I couldn't say goodbye.

152
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,965
[SANJI] I hate to
put you guys out,

153
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,401
but looks like you'll
have to find a new cook.

154
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,784
Mosshead, you son of a...

155
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,157
Now show me
you've got some honor.

156
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:34,888
You've made sure I can't
even touch Straw Hat.

157
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:37,324
Not unless I want
to shame myself.

158
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,060
Then you've got my respect.

159
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:45,899
[KUMA]
If that's what you want,

160
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:47,367
I give you my word.

161
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,470
I won't take Straw Hat's head.

162
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,508
[KUMA] But if you're
intent on taking his place,

163
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:00,781
you will experience
a living hell.

164
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,129
[KUMA] I've just repelled
all physical injury

165
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,031
from Straw Hat's body.

166
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:21,001
His exhaustion, his pain.

167
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,970
What rests before
you is the sum total

168
00:19:23,003 --> 00:19:26,240
of anguish he endured during
his battle with Moria.

169
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,108
If you truly wish
to take his place,

170
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:32,079
then you must accept and
inflict his agony upon yourself.

171
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,282
[KUMA] As close to
death as you are already,

172
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:37,618
not only will it
undoubtedly kill you,

173
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,487
it will do so painfully.

174
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,322
Why don't you have a taste?

175
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:16,990
[KUMA]
Do you still want it?

176
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,330
[ZORO] Just let
me pick the location.

177
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,945
[KUMA] To inspire such
loyalty in his friends.

178
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,514
He couldn't be
anyone's son but yours,

179
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,083
could he, Dragon?

180
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,560
[RISKY BROTHER MASK]
Hey, is everyone still alive?

181
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,362
Are you guys okay?

182
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,999
He must've just
assumed we were all dead

183
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,234
after that explosion
and left the island,

184
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,736
which means that we won!

185
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,337
Stupid Paw-Man!

186
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:38,338
This hurts.

187
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:39,606
[LUFFY cheering]

188
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,475
[FRANKY] Oh, c'mon,
you've gotta be kidding.

189
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,510
How're you bouncing
around like that?

190
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,445
[LUFFY laughing]

191
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,014
[LUFFY]
This is awesome!

192
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:49,650
My body feels as good as new!
I wonder why?

193
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,450
[USOPP]
Quit lying!

194
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:52,653
Calm down before
you hurt yourself!

195
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,354
[ROBIN] It's possible he
took so much damage

196
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:56,223
to the brain it
knocked him silly.

197
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:57,057
[FRANKY]
Let's hope not.

198
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,493
He was too damn
silly to begin with.

199
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,360
[LUFFY]
I feel great!

200
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:07,100
[CREW overlapping
concerned chatter]

201
00:22:32,592 --> 00:22:34,695
No way that guy
just let us go.

202
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,763
Damn it, Zoro, what'd you do?

203
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
[SANJI]
That's him.

204
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,638
You really freaked me out there.

205
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,207
So what happened to the Warlord?

206
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:55,248
Where the hell'd all
this blood come from?

207
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:57,517
Hey! Are you still alive?

208
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,352
Where'd that paw guy go?

209
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,455
What in the hell happened here?

210
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:08,028
What happened here?
Nothing at all.

211
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:22,209
[CHOPPER] I've never seen Zoro
injured this badly before.

212
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:23,477
What could've happened?

213
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,245
[BROOK]
I saw what transpired.

214
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,379
[CHOPPER]
What?

215
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,615
[BROOK] Isn't it wonderful
to have comrades like him?

216
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:30,317
Hey, our dear friends,

217
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,220
I must fulfill the promise
I made to my own.

218
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:34,654
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

219
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,556
"The Promise from a Distant Day!

220
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,192
The Pirate Song
and a Small Whale."

221
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:41,428
I'm gonna be King of the
Pirates!
