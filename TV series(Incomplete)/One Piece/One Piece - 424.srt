00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,591
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,394
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,230
in search of the One Piece,
the legendary treasure

40
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,433
left behind by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,236
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,071
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,741
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,744
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,412
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,447
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,783
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,620
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,090
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,227
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,863
the crew will cut a path
across the Grand Line

52
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,765
to the New World!

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,437
[NARRATOR] After his crew was
scattered around the world,

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,539
Luffy set off to rescue
his brother, Ace,

55
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,274
who had been
captured by the Navy

56
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,778
and sent to a massive prison
known as Impel Down.

57
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,648
On his way down to Level 5,
a closely guarded floor

58
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,251
where the most infamous
criminals were held,

59
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,621
Luffy encountered
an old acquaintance.

60
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,456
Time for my specialty.

00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,362
You picked the wrong clown
to mess with, monkey.

[BLUGORI groans]

87
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,532
No. Don't get up!

Damn, you got a lot
stronger, didn't ya, kid?

94
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,864
[LUFFY] I don't know,
these guys are pretty tough.

95
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,932
What are they?

96
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,901
[BUGGY] Sea Monkeys.
Blue Gorillas, they're called.

97
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,403
Or Blugori, for short.
But stay sharp,

98
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,739
should be four more of them
left to take the place of--

99
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,509
Well, never mind,
guess you got them already!

100
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,545
[LUFFY] Either way, I hope
that's the last of 'em.

101
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,780
I don't have time to
mess around right now.

102
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,283
That guy's a monster!
How did he do that?

103
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,918
You came here to
let us out, didn't ya?

104
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,754
We'll be your best
friend, pal! I promise!

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]
Ca-lick.

106
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,425
[SKINNY GUARD]
Something wrong?

107
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,927
[SURVEILLANCE 424A]
You bet there is!

108
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,730
I thought you said only
one prisoner escaped.

109
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,698
Yeah, it was just the clown guy.

110
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,433
[SURVEILLANCE 424A]
Pretty sure I saw two guys,

111
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,735
but maybe I'm crazy.

112
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,271
And speaking of crazy,
5 Blugori got taken down

113
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,906
in front of
Community Cell Number 10.

114
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,743
[SKINNY GUARD]
On Level 1? There's no way.

115
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,611
The prisoners down there
aren't strong enough

116
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,613
to take on even one Blugori!

117
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:26,085
What? You broke in
here to rescue Ace?

118
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,986
[LUFFY]
Yep.

119
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,456
[BUGGY gasps]
Shh! We gotta stay quiet!

120
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,325
Not really followin'
your own advice there.

00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,293
We could really use
the keys to our cell

--if you're not too busy--
--Would you shut the hell up?

Nobody gives a damn!

[LUFFY]
Wait, do you know Ace?

125
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,769
Yeah. And though I can
see the resemblance,

126
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,004
he made a much better
impression than you did.

127
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:49,442
[BUGGY PIRATES laughing]

128
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,478
[BUGGY laughing]

129
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,856
You really think this is
the time to throw a party?

130
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,659
How can you plan on beating
Luffy and the rest of his crew

131
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,995
when you don't have
any idea where they are?

132
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,964
Oh, come on, don't be such
a party pooper, Alvida.

133
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:16,135
We'll find Luffy when we
find him, so just calm down.

134
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,837
[ACE]
If you're looking for Luffy,

135
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,639
I can tell you where he is.

136
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,507
There you go, problem solved.

137
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,444
This fellow here can lead us
straight to Straw Hat, any time!

138
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,346
Hold on, who in
the hell are you?

139
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,716
[ACE] Oh, hello.
Sorry for crashing your party.

140
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,019
Anyway, the name's Ace
and as you might guess,

141
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,855
I was drawn here by the
delicious aroma of your feast.

142
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,156
Thanks for feeding me.

143
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,692
No need to be polite,
we're all friends here.

144
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,361
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, friend.

145
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,696
Just 'cause you
introduce yourself,

146
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,631
doesn't mean you get
to eat my food!

147
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,533
My ship, my banquet, my rules!

148
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,035
So you take that meat
out of your mouth!

149
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,538
Captain! Be careful!
That guy is Fire Fist Ace!

150
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,739
Just let the man eat.

151
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,410
He's from Whitebeard's Crew.
The Second Division Commander.

152
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,644
[BUGGY PIRATES]
Did you say "Whitebeard?"

153
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:00,146
What?

154
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,515
Oh! You guys know
the old man, huh?

155
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,051
That's nice, he's a real--

156
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,086
He's sleeping?

157
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,522
After he woke up,
we had a few drinks,

158
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,724
chatted it up and
became pretty good pals.

159
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,495
So yeah, I think it sucks your
brother got thrown in here, too.

160
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,563
Kind of stupid of
the Navy to do that.

161
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,065
I'm sure Whitebeard'll
give 'em hell.

162
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,100
I heard they're
keeping Ace on Level 5.

163
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,035
Could you show me
the way to get there?

164
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,171
Not a chance in hell--
Go by yourself!

165
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,573
What, do you think
I'm your friend now?

166
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,943
In fact, you can die
down there for all I care.

167
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,179
So long.

168
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,081
If you don't want
to break out of here,

169
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,849
I'll just do it on my own.

170
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,218
[LUFFY] Okay, but there's
ten battleships out there.

171
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,921
I hope you've got a good plan.

172
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,524
That's not good.

173
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,025
All right. I get it.

174
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,128
They must be expecting
an attack from Whitebeard.

175
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,533
Guess I picked a bad time.

176
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,769
Huh. Maybe I can just lay low.

177
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,606
I'll find someone else then.

178
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,875
So are we getting
the key, or not?

179
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,612
No, no, I must be
imagining things.

180
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,615
What would he be doing
with something like that?

181
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,553
[BUGGY]
Then again...

182
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,127
Well, good luck
with your escape.

183
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,962
I gotta get moving.

184
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,966
[BUGGY]
No, that's gotta be it.

185
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,902
Wait, Straw Hat, don't go!

186
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,237
[LUFFY]
What's your problem?

187
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,104
[GUARD]
Up there!

188
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,173
[BUGGY] They found us!
[LUFFY screams]

189
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,475
No kidding! 'Cause you
won't stop yelling so much!

190
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,611
By the way, that's a lovely
armlet you've got there,

191
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,080
Straw Hat, do you think you can
give it to me, pretty please?

192
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,649
[LUFFY] No, it was a gift from
Nami. What do you want with it?

193
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,184
[BUGGY]
If you let me have the armlet,

194
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,153
I'll tell you how to get to Ace!

195
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,689
That a promise?

196
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,824
Sure. Just fork it over, kiddo.

197
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,793
Okay. Then you got a deal.

198
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:58,264
Alright! First off,
let's shake those guards.

199
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,865
Grab onto my feet, okay?

200
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,667
Your feet?

201
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,936
[BUGGY]
Good, now start running!

202
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,839
[BUGGY cackles]
Be careful with those!

203
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,941
Can't have you drop them!

204
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,978
[NARRATOR]
Let's review how Buggy's

205
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,614
Chop-Chop power works, shall we?

206
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,215
When he chop-chops
his body to pieces,

207
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,818
he can control each
part however he likes,

208
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,953
but only within a limited area.

209
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,989
And if his feet aren't
close to the ground,

210
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,659
he becomes unable to levitate
the rest of his body.

211
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:34,700
[BUGGY]
Damn, I am one lucky clown!

212
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,869
[BUGGY] I got the treasure
of a lifetime and a ticket

213
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,722
out of this crap
hole in one shot!

214
00:10:50,474 --> 00:10:53,377
[MOHJI]
Captain. Captain.

215
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,548
[BUGGY]
What?

216
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,283
[MOHJI] I'm just starting
to have second thoughts

217
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,818
about this place, that's all.

218
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:02,386
You sure this is the cave where

219
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,388
Captain John kept
his hidden treasure?

220
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,857
And the crew he left behind
never found it this whole time?

221
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:08,826
It seems a bit too easy.

222
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:11,328
[BUGGY] Just hold the
lantern and keep walking.

223
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:12,863
[MOHJI]
Yes sir.

224
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,567
[BUGGY] Now look alive boys,
the treasure is near

225
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,636
but so is unspeakable danger.

226
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,705
If you let your guard down
even for a second,

227
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,540
then death will creep up on you.

228
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,209
There's no telling what
kind of monsters will appear

229
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:30,014
or what kind of vicious booby
traps await to kill us all.

230
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:30,748
Hm?

231
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,749
[MINER BOSS 424A]
Come on men!

232
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,485
Another fine day carving
out tunnels awaits us!

233
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,586
[MINERS]
Right-O, boss!

234
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,389
Oh! You three must
be the new guys!

235
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,326
[BUGGY] Nothing like working
up a sweat, right Boss?

236
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,261
All a man really
needs is a pick axe

237
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,730
in his hand and
a tunnel to dig!

238
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:46,997
[MINER BOSS 424A]
That's right!

239
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,766
And because of our good old
fashioned elbow grease everyone

240
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,367
who comes to this
tunnel will smile!

241
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,569
[BUGGY]
It's liberating!

242
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,871
You know, after all this hard
labor we ought to head over

243
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,407
to the Old Bilge Barge for a--
[BUGGY screams]

244
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,578
How dare you make me work
like one of your lackies!

245
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,880
[BUGGY] Unfortunately that
wasn't the first dead end

246
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,682
we hit and it
wouldn't be the last.

247
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:08,552
We ran all over the Grand Line
looking for that treasure.

248
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,454
As if that wasn't crappy enough,

249
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,790
my ill-fated treasure hunts
brought me straight to

250
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,760
a Navy Post one day and the
bastards threw me in this dump

251
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:17,762
when they captured me.

252
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,799
[BUGGY] But maybe it was
destiny all along guiding me

253
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,768
to Captain John's treasure.

254
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,270
[BUGGY] Step on it,
Straw Hat, time's a wasting!

255
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:27,438
[LUFFY grunts]

256
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,040
[BUGGY] Follow me and we'll
be at Level 2 in no time!

257
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:32,276
[LUFFY] Level 2?
Were you listening to me?

258
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,779
I said I wanted
to go to Level 5!

259
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,447
[BUGGY]
Don't you know how numbers work?

260
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,783
You gotta go through
2 to get to 5!

261
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,917
Let me explain.

262
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,886
Think of this as an
upside down tower.

263
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,622
The place we're at right
now is called Level 1,

264
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:46,323
which is the
first basement floor.

265
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,059
After that you go to
Level 2 and 3 and so on.

266
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:53,097
The deeper you get, the more
infamous the criminals are.

267
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,066
They tortured me in the
fires of Level 4 a few times

268
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,302
but that's as far as
I've gone, myself.

269
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,071
Everything else is just things
I've heard from other people.

270
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,908
[BUGGY] Level 5 is where they
take all the big shots, though.

271
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:07,111
So with a bounty as high as your
brother's, he's gotta be there.

272
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:10,014
[BLUGORI D panting]

273
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,515
[LUFFY panting]

274
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,684
As for what's
below Level 5, well,

275
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,453
I've heard some rumors,
but the details are scarce.

276
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,455
The theory is, the criminals
they send down there

277
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,491
are so dangerous that
they've been completely

278
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,592
wiped from history.

279
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,994
Now that I think about it,
there's a good chance

280
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,796
that's where they
took your brother.

281
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,332
But the furthest I can
take you is Level 4,

282
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,934
so you're on your
own after that.

283
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,035
Thanks, Buggy!

284
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,504
I thought you were a real jerk,
but I guess I was wrong!

285
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,940
[BUGGY cackling]
A deal's a deal!

286
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:38,108
And if that armlet leads me
to Captain John's treasure,

287
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:40,778
I'm getting a real bargain, kid!

288
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,718
[BUGGY] I shouldn't have
opened my big mouth.

289
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,153
Hey, you know what?

290
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,888
[BUGGY]
Uh, what?

291
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,857
If you got caught,
you're a pretty crappy pirate.

292
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:56,026
What the hell, man,
gimme a break!

293
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,962
[BUGGY]
The idiot didn't even hear me.

294
00:13:57,995 --> 00:13:59,830
I'm lucky he's so stupid.

295
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:00,831
[LUFFY]
That's awesome.

296
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:03,868
This is a treasure map?
I didn't have a clue.

297
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,870
Bet that'll be really fun, huh?

298
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:07,838
[BUGGY gasps]

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
Sorry kid, but if
you know the truth,

300
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,078
I'll have to kill ya!

301
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,547
[LUFFY] You better take this
now in case I forget later.

302
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,719
[BUGGY gasping]

303
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,888
[BUGGY] You... You know
that's a treasure map

304
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,923
and you're still gonna
give it to me?

305
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,024
[LUFFY]
Yeah, of course.

306
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,093
Treasure's cool and all,
but Ace is more important.

307
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,861
But if you give it to me now,

308
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,663
what's to stop me
from running off with it

309
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,031
and leaving you
down here to die?

310
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:35,432
Nothing, I guess.

311
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,001
But you gave your
word you'd help out,

312
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,869
and that's good enough for me!

313
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:44,608
[BUGGY] Those trusting eyes,
boring into my soul!

314
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,012
I'm a scoundrel,
Straw Hat, can't you see?

315
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,680
Don't do it!

316
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:55,586
You deserve better than this!
I'm no good for you!

317
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,924
[BUGGY] After all this time,
I finally have the key

318
00:14:59,924 --> 00:15:02,960
to Captain John's secret
and I owe it all to you!

319
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:08,766
Thanks, buddy,
you're a real champ.

320
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:12,703
[BUGGY] Now how do I ditch you
and get the hell out of here?

321
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:17,207
[BUGGY groans]

322
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,943
Oh, if we break through
the walls here,

323
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,145
is it like a shortcut?
I can do that!

324
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,479
[BUGGY]
What's wrong with you?

325
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,914

326
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:30,471
[BUGGY groans]

327
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,178
[HANCOCK]
I do hope Luffy is safe.

328
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,214
I warned him to
stay out of trouble

329
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,016
but that may have been in vain.

330
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,385
Breaking your brother out
will be challenging enough,

331
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:11,353
but if you get captured as well,

332
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,722
who knows what
horrors you might face.

333
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:18,027
One wrong step and you may never
see the light of day again.

334
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,730
I know you want to save Ace,
but this is dangerous.

00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,900
Please, take care
of yourself, too.

336

[HANCOCK gasps]

337
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,903
I won't let you down,
you have my word.

Thanks for everything, Hancock--
you're the best.

Oh, my love.

00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:37,546
I can hear your angelic voice,

343
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,116
echoing through the
chambers of my heart!

344
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,452
[HANNYABAL]
Okey dokey, almost there.

345
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,090
[PRISONER screams]

346
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:51,393
[HANNYABAL] Whew, that was
a good one, wasn't it?

347
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,128
[DOMINO] Our jailers
are certainly skilled

348
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,396
at what they do.

349
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,398
[HANNYABAL]
Did you hear that, empress?

350
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,935
No? Well worry not, milady,
there are plenty more

351
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,271
blood-curdling screams
where those came from.

352
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,907
If you don't have a
taste for sadism yet,

353
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,141
we'll do our darndest

354
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:10,446
to change your mind before this
little visit has come to an end.

355
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,481
[HANCOCK]
Silence, you accursed fool!

356
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,817
You interrupted my
romantic reverie!

357
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:17,920
I thought I was being polite,
but she's stepping on me.

358
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,088
This might require
a new approach.

359
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,090
[DOMINO]
Please, empress, he means well!

360
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,591
Actually, this is kinda hot.

361
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,459
[DOMINO]
Huh?

362
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,295
Oops! I said that
out loud, didn't I?

363
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,001
[LUFFY yells]

364
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,238
[BUGGY groans]

365
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:39,174
[LUFFY grunts]

366
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,311
What the hell is going on here?

367
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,947
That clown is Buggy,
the escaped prisoner.

368
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,815
But who is the other guy?

369
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:48,584
[BUGGY]
Oh no, this is the guard room!

370
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,420
If we keep going this way,
I'm in trouble.

371
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,989
For crap's sake, please stop!

372
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,362
[BUGGY screams]

373
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,598
This place is crazy!

374
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:05,534
I mean there's a
forest in the prison?

375
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:11,373
And why's everything all red?

376
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,442
[LUFFY]
Who are those guys down there?

377
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,043
They're prisoners, stupid!

378
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,013
This so-called "forest"
is a torture chamber!

379
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,215
[BUGGY] Every leaf is
as sharp as a razor.

380
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,285
That's why they call
them "Blade Trees."

381
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:26,455
And the grass is made of spikes
that prick you like needles!

382
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:30,025
It's called "Spike Needle
Grass." Original, I know.

383
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,161
The jailers release
venomous spiders

384
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,564
and chase the prisoners up and
down the forest all day long.

385
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:39,067
Deadly pitchforks behind them,
piercing needles beneath them

386
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,236
and cutting razors
everywhere else.

387
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,505
They run until they're
drenched in their own blood,

388
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,974
suffering agonies they
never thought possible.

389
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,210
This is Level 1,
otherwise known as

390
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:51,346
the Crimson Hell!
The true face of Impel Down!

391
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,916
[RANDOM PRISONER 424B]
Haven't I suffered enough?

392
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:57,052
[RANDOM PRISONER 424C]
You're gonna kill me!

393
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,321
Wow, this place
really is like hell!

394
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,523
Are they doing this
kind of stuff to Ace, too?

395
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,059
Don't think about it!
Just keep falling!

396
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,895
That's dumb!
We're gonna get cut!

397
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:11,033
[BUGGY]
Oh yeah? Ha! Watch this!

398
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,201
Listen up, kid.

399
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,203
Now take my feet
and throw 'em down

400
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,537
on the ground right below us!

401
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,905
Are you sure?

402
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,173
Okay.

403
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,086
Holy crap. You don't
see that every day.

404
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,187
Whoa! Careful!

405
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:35,190
[BUGGY laughs]
Are you kiddin' me?

406
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:36,291
This is a cinch!

407
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,027
[BUGGY] And the good news is,
we don't need to go down

408
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:40,529
any stairs to get
to the next level.

409
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:43,565
No stairs, no gate, no key--
just free falling.

410
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,434
The normal prisoners
wouldn't want to take it,

411
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,636
but there is one way to get
out of the Crimson Hell

412
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,571
that'll be perfect
for our little plan!

413
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,974
Okay, I'll take
your word for it.

414
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,584
[BUGGY]
See? We're already here.

415
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,453
[LUFFY]
A hole?

416
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,657
[LUFFY]
Whoa! I can't see a thing!

417
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:11,960
[BUGGY laughs]
Like I said, there's a way out,

418
00:20:11,994 --> 00:20:13,562
but nobody wants to take it.

419
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,763
Can you guess why?

420
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,466
It's not 'cause it's
dark and scary.

421
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,468
It's because this hole
is a one way trip

422
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:23,138
down to Level 2. And if you
think things are bad here, well,

423
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,640
you ain't seen
nothing yet, kiddo.

424
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,241
When people get sent to hell,

425
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,610
you better believe they'll
try to claw their way out.

426
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,646
But no one in their right
mind would ever dream

427
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,148
of diving further into
the abyss.

428
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,784
Yeah, I get it. Then it's
good thing we're crazy!

429
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,685
Just jump down, huh?

430
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:38,520
[BUGGY] Yeah, but be
careful, there's a--

431
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,088
[LUFFY grunts]
[BUGGY screams]

432
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,990
[BUGGY]
Are you kidding me?

433
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,592
Wow, it's deep!

434
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,494
What do you think's down there?

435
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,533
Jeez! Would you
give it a minute, kid?

436
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,469
You got huge balls
or just a tiny brain?

437
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,772
Well, this works out for me.

438
00:20:56,805 --> 00:21:00,275
Now I can blow this joint
and he can't say a damn thing.

[BUGGY cackling]

440
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,519
I got the key to the treasure,

441
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:13,522
I got that chump off my back
and soon, I'll be free!

442
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,657
I'd say "see you
in hell," buddy,

443
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,526
but I've been there
and done that!

444
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,663
I robbed you, got my revenge,
and you thanked me for it!

He and Buggy both
fell to Level 2.

Hey.

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,856
Is it just me, or do the beasts
seem kind of restless today?

[RANDOM PRISONER 424E]
As long as they're not hungry!

461
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,593
Anything but that!

462
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,537
I'm too tired to be
afraid anymore,

463
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,105
I don't even care.

464
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,307
I'm going to be their
dinner sooner or later--

465
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:42,144
it might as well
be today, I suppose.

[NARRATOR] Luffy and Buggy
make their way to Level 2

where the wild beasts
of Hell dwell.

And they soon find that
the strange creatures

471
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,784
live up to their reputation.

472
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,253
Meanwhile, Hancock reaches
the heart of the prison,

473
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:28,690
and is greeted by none other
than the warden, Magellan.
