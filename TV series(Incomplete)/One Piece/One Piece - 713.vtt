00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.816
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.722
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:45.397
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.469
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.604 --> 00:02:51.710
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:53.614
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.747 --> 00:02:56.119
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:58.991
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.200
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.836
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:13.252
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:17.061
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:18.698
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:24.709
and launched an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:27.816
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.755
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.193
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:35.263
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:35.396 --> 00:03:37.334
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.374
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:44.916
[DELLINGER] "Sense of duty"
is a shackle for the weak.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.567
[IDEO gasps]

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:19.018
The strength of a Fighting Fish
courses through every muscle.

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.654
[DELLINGER gasps]

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:24.863
[GLADIUS gasps]

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:47.675
Oh man, that guy's
freaky as hell!

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.313
What is up with that face?

00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:26.853
[ROBIN]
Why don't you calm down?

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:29.057
You're not going
anywhere on my watch.

00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.897
That's quite a wicked
look on your face.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.538
Poor Cabbage.
D'you need something?

00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:46.425
[LUFFY] "Barrier-Barrier!
Homage Holy Fist Strikes!"

00:05:55.243 --> 00:05:58.216
I'm sorry, but I don't
have time to play.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.521
Rebecca needs me.

00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:14.415
[BARTOLOMEO]
Whoa! She stopped him!

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.654
What a move!

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:20.661
Miss Robin is so cool!

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:22.565
[BARTOLOMEO]
What was I thinking,

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:24.703
saying I would protect you,

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:28.877
when I so clearly pale
before your brilliance?

00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:39.097
Seems like you're not
interested in behaving.

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:44.709
[gasps]

00:06:45.477 --> 00:06:47.615
Damn it, Hakuba!

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:49.418
[ROBIN gasps]

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.471
I didn't give you
permission to do this--

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:02.812
You cannot come out right now!

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:14.903
I didn't mean to do that.

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:16.906
Forgive me for attacking you.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.080
I've heard word of
your deadly alter-ego.

00:07:20.214 --> 00:07:21.550
Hakuba, right?

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:25.189
[pants] That was him.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:27.895
He's quite the monster.

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:31.035
He goes after anyone he sees.

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:34.041
[snores]

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:38.249
First, I'll take
your arms and legs!

00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:42.925
Then, I'll chop your whole body
into tiny pieces, Nico Robin!

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:43.894
[ROBIN gasps]

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:46.231
No one can escape my blade!

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:50.473
[groaning]

00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:59.893
Would you go away?
Now is not the time!

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:03.934
Shut up! Why don't you
go back to sleep?

00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:06.406
You don't understand
the importance of this fight!

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.877
I have a personal debt to repay!

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.982
I'll turn this place
into a sea of blood!

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.286
This battle is
my responsibility!

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:16.258
[HAKUBA] I don't care!
I'll rip this woman to shreds!

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:19.932
[CAVENDISH] See! You're not even
attacking the right people!

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:22.070
[BARTOLOMEO] He must have
a split personality.

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:24.408
Unless this is just how
he makes decisions.

00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:25.476
My body!

00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.546
My body!

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.782
Let me fight!

00:08:27.916 --> 00:08:28.517
No, me!

00:08:28.651 --> 00:08:29.719
No, me!

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:31.823
Me, me, me, me, me, me!

00:08:31.957 --> 00:08:33.961
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:08:34.094 --> 00:08:35.497
--[HAKUBA] Yes!
--[CAVENDISH] No!

00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:36.466
--[HAKUBA] Yes!
--[CAVENDISH] No!

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.568
[HAKUBA]
Yes!

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:39.071
[CAVENDISH]
Hakuba!

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:41.108
[HAKUBA, CAVENDISH]
This fight is mine!

00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:44.882
Now he's half Cabbage
and half psycho!

00:08:46.118 --> 00:08:49.992
[groans] I have had enough!

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:55.237
This body belongs to me!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.275
[BARTOLOMEO] You was
half-and-half just a second ago!

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:02.919
[panting]

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:04.522
[BARTOLOMEO]
Hey! Come on!

00:09:04.656 --> 00:09:07.528
I didn't just
imagine that, did I?

00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:09.364
All right, I think
he's gone now.

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:13.740
Please, Robin, could you
release me from your grip?

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:17.247
Let go you?
After what I just saw?

00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:18.249
[gasps]

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:19.719
[CAVENDISH gasps]

00:09:22.357 --> 00:09:25.931
[GLADIUS]
You're fine right where you are.

00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:28.904
[BOTH gasp]

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:39.391
[GLADIUS] I'll take my revenge
on both of you at once!

00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:41.095
Even if you try to fly away,

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:45.203
you can't escape the blast
radius of the entire wall!

00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:48.209
Cut that out!

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:51.248
There's no way we'll
survive up here.

00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:53.286
You need to abandon
the plan for now.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:54.221
Let's get down!

00:09:54.355 --> 00:09:55.858
I can't!

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.262
In the time that takes,
Rebecca could be badly hurt.

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:01.335
[BARTOLOMEO]
Don't worry, I got this!

00:10:01.468 --> 00:10:05.376
You keep your damn explosions
away from Miss Robin!

00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:08.149
[GLADIUS] That's a surprisingly
sound judgement.

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:11.956
If you defeat me, it will
indeed cancel the rupture.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.061
[yells]

00:10:14.194 --> 00:10:17.133
[GLADIUS]
Pop Hair!

00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:25.918
Like that'll stop me!

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:30.260
I'm all numb! What'd you do?

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:32.765
[GLADIUS]
Those hairs are poison needles.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:34.368
--[BARTOLOMEO] What?
--Hey, are you all right?

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:35.505
Rooster, oh no!

00:10:35.638 --> 00:10:38.844
He got me! That was tricky!

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:45.156
[GLADIUS] This is the power
of the Pop-Pop Fruit.

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:54.141
[GLADIUS] From head to toe,
I am a Rupture Man.

00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:55.945
[gasps]

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:59.519
[GLADIUS] If you do harm to me,
my whole body will burst.

00:10:59.653 --> 00:11:02.324
And thousands of those
poison needles that handily

00:11:02.457 --> 00:11:07.233
thwarted you will pierce
your two friends, up above.

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:12.411
[GLADIUS] Of course,
if you don't harm me,

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:15.518
the wall will explode.

00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:18.055
So? Which shall it be?

00:11:18.188 --> 00:11:20.460
Keep in mind that
the explosion of my body

00:11:20.594 --> 00:11:22.197
will kill you as well.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.934
[BARTOLOMEO]
That's a crap deal!

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:25.604
I'm not worried about
me getting wrecked,

00:11:25.738 --> 00:11:28.242
but it seems like Miss Robin
gets hurt either way.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:32.952
[GLADIUS] Well, look at you!
Such a fast learner!

00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:35.257
[BARTOLOMEO] C'mon, don't let
him get under your skin.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.394
Keep your eyes on
the prize, Barto.

00:11:37.528 --> 00:11:39.699
What's your priority right now?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.010
[BARTOLOMEO] That's obvious.
I gotta protect Miss Robin!

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:46.980
I can't let her
fall that height,

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:49.552
and I sure can't
let her get blown up.

00:11:49.685 --> 00:11:51.823
If wanna stop the explosion,

00:11:51.956 --> 00:11:55.330
I gotta bust up this
fatass hedgehog dude.

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:57.868
But then there's
the poison needle thing,

00:11:58.002 --> 00:12:00.406
which'll hurt Robin, as well.

00:12:02.043 --> 00:12:03.947
[BARTOLOMEO] I gotta think
outside the box here.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.989
C'mon brain, think.
No, think harder!

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:09.625
Go up or down, your choice!

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:13.600
Either way, you have to
release me and run for it!

00:12:13.734 --> 00:12:15.036
[gasps]

00:12:15.904 --> 00:12:18.409
Wait a sec! What if
there's some way I can

00:12:18.543 --> 00:12:21.850
sacrifice Cabbage
to save Miss Robin?

00:12:21.984 --> 00:12:23.687
I got an idea, Cabbage!

00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:27.260
I'm gonna beat up the hedgehog
guy to stop the explosion,

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:28.997
then when the poison
things shoot out,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.068
you act as a human
shield and make sure

00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:32.538
none of them hit Miss Robin!

00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:33.507
[HAKUBA]
Idiot.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.776
Did you hear me?

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.411
[HAKUBA]
Shut up, Rooster!

00:12:36.546 --> 00:12:39.217
[BARTOLOMEO]
Cabbage got all evil again!

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:42.123
[BARTOLOMEO groans]
We got an emergency here

00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.162
and he can't keep
his head on straight!

00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:50.006
Miss Robin's in danger
from Bad Cabbage, too!

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.945
I need a plan right now!

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:56.151
[BARTOLOMEO]
That's it!

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:05.937
[yells]

00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:11.215
[yells]

00:13:11.348 --> 00:13:13.319
[GLADIUS]
Decided to attack me?

00:13:13.453 --> 00:13:16.458
[BARTOLOMEO] I can only
put up one barrier at a time,

00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:19.832
but that's okay, that's all
I need to pull this off.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:23.841
[BARTOLOMEO yells]

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.911
[BARTOLOMEO] As long as
I can save Miss Robin,

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:29.885
I won't think twice!
I got no regrets!

00:13:32.323 --> 00:13:35.262
[BARTOLOMEO]
Barrier Ball!

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:38.269
[GLADIUS]
Huh?

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.311
You can blow up
all you like, Fatso!

00:13:42.444 --> 00:13:44.481
Nothing's getting
past that barrier!

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.185
It's just you and me!

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:48.422
--[GLADIUS] You fool!
--It's time to finish you off!

00:13:48.557 --> 00:13:52.030
[yells]

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.468
[GLADIUS groans]

00:13:55.203 --> 00:13:58.442
Rooster, stop! What're you--

00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:05.022
[GLADIUS] Going to sacrifice
yourself, are you? Fine, then!

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:13.272
[GLADIUS]
Fashion Pop!

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:19.985
Rooster, no!

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:23.560
[BARTOLOMEO] Suck on that,
you stupid hedgehog.

00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:28.937
I shut you down and
I shut down your wall bomb.

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:34.414
Keep going, Miss Robin...

00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:11.523
[panting]

00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:14.294
[BARTOLOMEO]
I saved Miss Robin.

00:15:14.427 --> 00:15:18.001
What more could I ever ask for?

00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:29.123
[GLADIUS groans] Nice try,
but your aim needs work.

00:15:31.328 --> 00:15:34.034
[GLADIUS] You missed
by just a few centimeters.

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.706
In other words, it was
my shoulder you stabbed,

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.342
not my throat.

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:41.716
[BARTOLOMEO]
No, I was so close!

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.954
Since he was so big and round,

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:47.628
I couldn't tell
what was what! Damn it!

00:15:47.762 --> 00:15:50.066
[GLADIUS]
You're a Power Holder as well,

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.903
so you know how this works.

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:53.372
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:15:53.506 --> 00:15:56.278
[GLADIUS]
As long as I'm conscious...

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:01.021
[GLADIUS] ...the effects
of my ability persist.

00:16:01.154 --> 00:16:02.457
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]

00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:04.327
[GLADIUS]
Now, since you can't move,

00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:06.398
you can sit there and
watch your friends explode!

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:09.104
[BARTOLOMEO]
How did I screw this up so bad?

00:16:09.238 --> 00:16:12.376
Damn it! I'm so stupid!

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:17.153
[CAVENDISH] Forgive me
for that lapse just now.

00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:18.557
This is Cavendish.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.828
I brought Hakuba
under control again.

00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:24.267
But I have allowed him
to borrow half of my body.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.276
Now let go of me!
So that I can kill you!

00:16:28.409 --> 00:16:30.012
I'll use Hakuba's
speed to help you

00:16:30.146 --> 00:16:31.783
escape to the Sunflower Field!

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:34.855
Otherwise, we'll all explode
when the bomb goes off!

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.358
There's no other option left!

00:16:36.492 --> 00:16:40.233
Please, let go!
You have to trust me!

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.703
[ROBIN]
Which one?

00:16:41.836 --> 00:16:43.974
[CAVENDISH]
There's no time to think!

00:16:44.107 --> 00:16:45.577
Hurry!

00:16:53.827 --> 00:16:55.864
[GLADIUS]
It's over.

00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:57.500
No! You bastard!

00:16:57.635 --> 00:16:59.672
[GLADIUS]
Pop Rock...

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:05.550
[GLADIUS]
...Super Arena!

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:12.363
[BARTOLOMEO]
Miss Robin!

00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:23.720
[GLADIUS] Your barrier
was useful after all.

00:17:23.854 --> 00:17:30.065
[crying]

00:17:32.805 --> 00:17:37.347
[GLADIUS] Look. Both of them,
gone without a trace.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.183
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:17:42.691 --> 00:17:47.199
Why'd you stop me?
You're hurting your own body!

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.905
If I'm willing to
take things this far,

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:53.178
maybe you should listen to me.

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:59.090
Cien Fleurs! Spider Net, hurry!

00:18:04.267 --> 00:18:06.071
You protected me.

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:08.810
Your hand stopped
Hakuba's sword.

00:18:10.046 --> 00:18:12.383
What a complicated man.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:22.470
[GLADIUS] Absurd! How could they
escape from a rupture that size?

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:26.712
[BARTOLOMEO] Miss Robin.
I'm so glad you're safe.

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:40.674
[BARTOLOMEO] But it's pathetic
that I couldn't protect you.

00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:43.311
I had one job!

00:18:44.615 --> 00:18:46.351
[BARTOLOMEO]
If it was him...

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:50.727
If it was Mister Luffy,
things woulda been different.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.263
Now listen!

00:18:52.396 --> 00:18:55.637
I'm the man who'll be
King of the Pirates!

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:16.311
[laughs]

00:19:16.445 --> 00:19:20.386
Still alive after all!
That's nice!

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:31.007
[BARTOLOMEO] Monkey D. Luffy!
The Straw Hat Pirates!

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.212
His bounty went up again!

00:19:33.345 --> 00:19:35.784
He's going places fast, man!

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:39.725
[panting]

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:44.535
[BARTOLOMEO] His Gum-Gum moves
are kinda like this, right?

00:19:46.305 --> 00:19:51.214
[BARTOLOMEO yelling]

00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:59.431
[BARTOLOMEO]
Mister Luffy!

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.236
Here, let me help ya!

00:20:13.827 --> 00:20:17.467
[BARTOLOMEO] It's gotta
be him. It's Mister Luffy!

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:22.109
[LUFFY] Get ready for
my Gum-Gum... Thor!

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:24.214
[CHIN JAO]
Non-Drill Dragon!

00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:27.253
Elephant Gun!

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:29.992
[CHIN JAO]
Non-Nail!

00:20:30.125 --> 00:20:36.304
[LUFFY grunting]

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.247
Heck yeah!

00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:44.655
[laughs]

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:48.596
[BARTOLOMEO] I knew it!
Mister Luffy is the real deal!

00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:51.636
He's strong, he's cool,
and one day,

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:55.042
he's gonna be the King of
the Pirates, for sure!

00:20:56.612 --> 00:20:59.718
[BARTOLOMEO grunting]

00:20:59.852 --> 00:21:02.056
I should be ashamed of myself,

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.298
thinking that I was good enough
to stand beside his Luffy-ness.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.870
Homage Holy Fist!

00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:14.313
[BARTOLOMEO]
Mister Luffy.

00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:16.552
I know I've still got
a long way to go,

00:21:16.686 --> 00:21:20.527
but I swear, I'll get
stronger and stronger.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.431
Barrier-Barrier...

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:31.247
[BARTOLOMEO]
Then, when I'm strong enough,

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:36.926
maybe someday, I'll be a man
who's worthy of helping you!

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:41.334
[BARTOLOMEO]
...Pistol!

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.870
[BARTOLOMEO]
Had to borrow a little of

00:21:59.004 --> 00:22:00.840
your strength there,
Mister Luffy.

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:02.142
Thanks.

00:22:02.276 --> 00:22:04.715
[sighs] Man, what a pain.

00:22:04.849 --> 00:22:08.155
I'm never teaming up
with Cabbage again.

00:22:08.289 --> 00:22:10.492
That dude's annoying as hell!

00:22:16.305 --> 00:22:17.908
[DIAMANTE chuckles]

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:20.747
[DIAMANTE] Sounds like they're
having a real party down there.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.052
Speaking of parties,
it seems like all this

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:27.795
rocking and rolling is too much,
even for seasoned gladiators.

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:29.297
Right, Rebecca?

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:30.432
[gasps]

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:32.403
Vipera Glaive!

00:22:32.538 --> 00:22:34.642
Look out! Run, Rebecca!

00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:36.879
You can't block that!

00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:39.785
Swift petals to sway his blade.

00:22:39.918 --> 00:22:41.522
Mil Fleurs now.

00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:44.194
Butterfly Orchid!

00:22:44.327 --> 00:22:45.295
[REBECCA gasps]

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:47.500
Just in time.

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:49.003
You saved me!

00:22:49.137 --> 00:22:50.840
[groans] Son of a--

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:52.276
Robiland!

00:22:52.409 --> 00:22:56.552
You finished your mission,
Rebecca. I'm grateful.

00:23:00.058 --> 00:23:02.698
Now it's my turn
to lend you a hand.

00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:06.037
Stand back. Let me
take care of him.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.692
[NARRATOR] With their Executives
falling one after another,

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:19.096
the Don Quixote Family
begins to lose ground.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.368
However, Giolla has
a secret plan

00:23:21.502 --> 00:23:23.405
that will revive
her fallen allies.

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.142
With precious
little time to spare,

00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:27.614
the tiny warrior Leo
leaps into action

00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:30.721
and his courage is put to
the test one last time!

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.456
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:35.597
"The Healing Princess!
Save Mansherry!"

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.936
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
