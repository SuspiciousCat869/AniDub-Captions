WEBVTT

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.013
[laughing]

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.818
My darkness will
swallow the world,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:34.222
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.225
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:38.363
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.672
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.049
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:46.166
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.369
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:52.011
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:53.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.319
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:58.824
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:03.801
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.470
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.978
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.119
Iâ€™m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.762
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:21.168
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:24.408
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made Devil Fruit

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:26.847
Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.786
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by a tournament

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.491
with the Flame-Flame
Fruit as a prize.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.698
Meanwhile, Sanji raids an
unknown villain's hideout

00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:38.871
at the request of Violet, with
whom he has fallen in love.

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:40.073
But then...

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:43.380
[VIOLET] If I could ask
just one more favor.

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:45.050
Uh...

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.287
[VIOLET]
Here is my final request.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.526
You must give your life to me.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.697
Every last drop of it,
"Black Leg".

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.841
Whoa. Let's back up here.
I mean, what're you saying?

00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:00.481
[VIOLET chuckles]
You really are a fool.

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:03.453
[NARRATOR] On a nearby bridge,
Law proceeds to Greenbit

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:06.760
with Robin and Usopp in
order to hand over Caesar.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.666
[FIGHTING FISH D growls]

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.969
What stopped it?

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:12.706
[FEMALE OLD DWARF A]
Looks like we bagged one!

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.909
[FEMALE DWARF A]
Then hurry and reel it in!

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.754
[USOPP] You don't actually
expect us to go in there?

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:38.189
So. This must be... Green Bit!

00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:41.930
Gotta say, the landscaping
leaves a lot to be desired.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.037
Hey! Joker, I'm here!

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.877
Come and get me!

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.746
[LAW]
Save your breath.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.588
You see that beach on the
southeast side of the island?

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.927
We're gonna leave you there at
three o'clock this afternoon.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.203
[LAW]
He'll be here shortly.

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:22.344
[USOPP yelps]
Do you guys see what I see?

00:05:22.378 --> 00:05:25.116
There! Looks like
a Navy battle ship!

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.323
[USOPP]
And it's not just beached,

00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:30.995
it's actually stuck in
the island somehow.

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.832
How is that even possible?

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.817
[ROBIN] The cuts on
those plants look fresh.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.852
[USOPP]
Hm?

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:44.957
It appears that the
ship has only arrived

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.960
on the island recently.

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:49.633
Its body doesn't
look all that damaged.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:51.335
[USOPP] So they would've
had to survive those

00:05:51.368 --> 00:05:53.807
Fighting Fish-infested waters!

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:58.450
I'm sure the Marines who
were on it aren't far away.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.053
We should be careful.

00:06:00.086 --> 00:06:03.528
What? Do they know
what we're doing here?

00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:05.396
This changes everything!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.502
Dammit, Caesar, I knew I
should have gagged you!

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.173
Quiet down! Shh! Shh!

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:13.012
Quiet!
I'm a wanted man, remember?

00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:15.150
And now that my boss
Joker's officially resigned

00:06:15.184 --> 00:06:18.991
from the Seven Warlords, there's
no authority that'll protect me!

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:20.661
If you leave me
here in handcuffs,

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.901
then those Marines are sure
to find me. And then--!

00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:27.074
[USOPP grunts]
Shh! I said, be quiet!

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:28.711
[CAESAR CLOWN]
If Joker gave up his status,

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:31.550
that put him back on
their wanted list, right?

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:35.290
Oh, what's the difference?
I'm history either way!

00:06:35.323 --> 00:06:37.361
It's over for me!

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:38.664
We're all wanted!

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.099
And if you're scared
of them catching you,

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:42.572
then you'd be better off
keeping your fat mouth shut!

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:44.842
[ROBIN]
Why is the Navy here?

00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:49.853
I think you're hiding something.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:52.191
Of course not.

00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:55.698
What would I do?
I don't control the Navy.

00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.004
By the way, after we leave here,

00:06:59.038 --> 00:07:01.644
I'm thinking about
heading over to Green Bit.

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:04.081
Who knows? The Straw
Hats may be useful,

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:06.987
or maybe I'm the one
who's useful to them.

00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:11.830
[LAW]
Hm?

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:14.736
We can not do the
transaction here! Rethink this!

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.640
Well, they're my enemy too.

00:07:16.674 --> 00:07:18.342
Look I'm with these guys.

00:07:18.376 --> 00:07:20.146
Come on, what do
I stand to gain

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.084
from the Straw Hats
getting captured?

00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:23.621
If we're all on the same side,

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:26.425
why don't you take
off my handcuffs?

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:28.029
[LAW]
We have 15 minutes.

00:07:28.063 --> 00:07:28.764
[CAESAR CLOWN, USOPP gasp]

00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:29.966
Here's the plan.

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:34.375
You two go hide somewhere,
and be prepared to snipe.

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:35.945
Stay on guard, though,

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.416
they may be in the
forest as we speak.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.757
If you find anything, let me
know as soon as you can.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.493
Sounds simple enough.

00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:45.029
Now hold on, Law!

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.402
I didn't sign up for a
military operation here!

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:02.865
[ROBIN grunts]

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:09.646
[USOPP]
R-Robin!

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:10.848
[ROBIN gasps]

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:13.521
[USOPP chuckles nervously]

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:18.597
It's dangerous! Wait! A-Ah.
Don't get too far ahead of me!

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.066
[ROBIN chuckles]
Wow, Usopp,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:22.572
you're really making
me feel safe. So brave!

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:24.643
[USOPP]
Oh, real helpful!

00:08:24.676 --> 00:08:25.611
Whoa!

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.716
[USOPP grunts]

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.351
I said, don't leave me!

00:08:33.493 --> 00:08:35.496
What's the hurry, anyway?

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.400
Eh? Ah...

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.906
[USOPP grunts]
If you're gonna stop, say so!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.343
[MARINE A] Show yourselves!
Are you the Straw Hats?

00:08:42.377 --> 00:08:44.248
[USOPP yelps]
They're here!

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:45.784
[ROBIN]
Shh!

00:08:50.093 --> 00:08:53.066
[MARINE A grunts]
Damn it! Where'd they go?

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.903
It's over! Come quietly!

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:57.809
We know you're on the island,
so just surrender now!

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:00.881
Right! Come out!
We've got you, Straw Hats!

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.585

That's not my name! I'm Leo!

[MARINE A]
Where's that voice coming from?

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:13.541
There they are...
But who are they talking to?

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:17.381
[ROBIN] Somehow they anticipated
we'd be on this island.

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:20.521
[LEO] Tell the truth, are you
good guys or bad guys?

00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:21.890
[MARINES gasp]

00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:23.293
[MARINE A]
We're Marines!

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:27.301
We keep the public safe,
so we're definitely good guys!

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.138
[LEO]
Then, hand over your weapons!

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:29.939

Uh?! We can't
give you these!

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:34.181
We have a job to do here!

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:35.818

Tell us who you are!

That's all I needed to hear.

00:09:45.369 --> 00:09:46.005
Where'd he go?

[USOPP, ROBIN gasp]

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.918
What happened? I can't see!

00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:10.788
I'd rather not see this.

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:13.560
[MARINES yell]

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:14.763
[MARINE A]
What kinda forest is this?

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:15.831
[MARINE D]
It's haunted!

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.868
[MARINE C] Least we still
got our underwear!

00:10:17.902 --> 00:10:20.473

Big People to cross us!

Yeah!

[DWARVES gasp]

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:34.334
I caught one!

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:36.840
[gasps]
Caught one what?

00:10:36.873 --> 00:10:38.677
It's a... person!

Oh no!

She got me!

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:50.166
[ROBIN]
I knew it.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.836
Let me go!

Turn Right...! I said right!

[WICKA]
Why did you turn left?

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:16.419
[ZORO] Put a sock in it, tiny!
I can't concentrate!

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:17.855
Okay...

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:20.326
Mom, who's he talking to?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.397
No one. Don't look at him.

00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.804
Come on, I'm in a hurry, here!

00:11:25.837 --> 00:11:27.809
[WICKA]
Not as much as I am!

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:31.215
If I get there late,
it's all your fault!

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:33.352
Now, take me to the
Flower Field already!

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:35.924

I'm going, just shut up!

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.572
[WICKA] Owie, ow ow.
Dang it! I really messed up!

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:01.577
That human's gonna see me!

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.179
[coughs]

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:06.018
[WICKA]
Run you dummy! Come on, hurry!

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:06.987
[gasps]

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.188
[WICKA gasps]

00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:12.865
[grunts]

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.671
[WICKA whimpers]

00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:21.649
Heh. I beg your pardon, sir.

00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:24.488
What're you, tell me!

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:27.896
[WICKA whines]

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:31.068
Oh, no! I'm so stupid!

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.005
I'm stupid and dumb and stupid!

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:36.412
I knew I would screw
this up somehow!

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.217
You must be one of those
fairy things, huh?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.153
That or a toy?

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:42.023
I'm not a toy at all!

00:12:42.056 --> 00:12:44.696
I'm Wicka and I'm from
the Tontatta tribe!

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:48.737
Now, please promise you won't
tell anyone you saw me!

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:50.039
[ZORO]
Uh...

00:12:50.073 --> 00:12:51.543
I beg you!

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:54.916
Whoa, shorty, none of this
is making any sense.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.157
Ah! The longer I stay here, the
worse everything's gonna get!

00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:05.771
Look, it's not like I was
gonna eat you or something.

00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:07.374
Start from the top.

00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:09.512
I... I can't tell you!

00:13:09.545 --> 00:13:10.681
[ZORO gasps]

00:13:10.715 --> 00:13:15.123
I'm sorry, but I can't tell
you Big People anything!

00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.961
I must leave, bye!

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.101
[WICKA yells]

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.738
[ZORO]
What now?!

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:24.141
[WICKA]
I can't walk!

00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:27.749
I think I must've twisted
my ankle back there.

00:13:27.782 --> 00:13:29.351
I'm so dumb!

00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:31.789
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:34.996
[ZORO gasps]
Wow, uh. You're strong.

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.733
Look what you're doing!

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.135
[WICKA]
Please, sir!

00:13:38.168 --> 00:13:39.906
I need you to take me
to see my commander

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.044
as quickly as possible, okay?

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:43.780
I mean, this whole
thing's kinda your fault

00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:45.618
when you get right down to it.

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:48.122
You stole my sword!
What was I supposed to do?

00:13:48.155 --> 00:13:50.392
Stole it? Of course not!

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:53.867
It's my people's job to protect
the greenery of this land!

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.403
The Big People call us fairies

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:58.376
and give us gifts in return
for the hard work we do!

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:00.279
I took the sword as a present!

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:03.554
Present? No way!
You're just a thief!

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:06.760
[whines]
Bad choice of words, I guess.

00:14:06.793 --> 00:14:10.033
Look, I gotta go!
I'm s'posed to be scouting!

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:12.738
My orders are to report to my
commander on the whereabouts

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:14.474
of the Don Quixote Family!

00:14:14.508 --> 00:14:15.376
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.347
Please, we're running
out of time!

00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:19.017
I saw them, honest!

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.988
I know for a fact they're
on their way to attack

00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:23.827
the Straw Hats' ship right now,
so we gotta hurry!

00:14:23.861 --> 00:14:25.096
[ZORO]
What?

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.401
Look, I gotta go!

00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:46.405
I was supposed to
be out scouting!

00:14:46.438 --> 00:14:48.510
My orders are to report
back to my commander

00:14:48.544 --> 00:14:51.616
on the Don Quixote Family's
whereabouts, and quick!

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.520
Please, we're running
out of time!

00:14:53.554 --> 00:14:55.223
I saw them, honest!

00:14:55.256 --> 00:14:57.193
I know for a fact they're
on their way to attack

00:14:57.226 --> 00:14:59.965
the Straw Hats' ship right now,
so we gotta hurry!

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:00.835
[ZORO]
What?

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:02.037
[gasps]

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.709
Oh, dummy! You just told
this guy everything

00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:06.245
you weren't supposed to say!

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:08.550
Hey! You're not pulling
my leg, right?

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:10.954
I'm one of the Straw Hats.
I really need to know!

00:15:10.988 --> 00:15:14.695
[WICKA]
Ah! Dumb, dumb, dumb!

00:15:14.728 --> 00:15:17.635
I'm so dumb! Stupid and dumb!

00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:20.073
And stupid!

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:24.783
Whoa, easy! You're wrecking
the whole town!

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:27.955
Calm down. Once more.
This is important.

00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:30.360
Is the Don Quixote Family
seriously getting ready

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:32.364
to attack the Sunny or not?

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:34.033
I can't tell you that!

00:15:34.067 --> 00:15:36.506
But they're not not
going to do it!

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.411
Aww. I did it again, huh?

00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:41.381
[ZORO grunts]

00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:43.152
I don't have a
Transponder Snail,

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:45.958
so there's no way for me
to warn them about it.

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:49.765
Those four, huh?
That's not a strong team.

00:15:51.803 --> 00:15:55.209
[ZORO]
All right. I'm off to the Sunny!

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:57.413
[WICKA]
W-Wait! Don't leave me here!

00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:59.919
I need you to take me
back to the Flower Field!

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:02.925
If you do, I promise I'll show
you the way back to the sea!

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:06.432
[ZORO] Forget about it,
I can find my own way back!

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:10.306
[gasps] You can? Then why are
you going the wrong way?

00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:12.544
[shouts]

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:14.148
[WICKA]
I knew it! You're lost!

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.618
You'll never get there!

00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:17.554
[gasps]

00:16:17.587 --> 00:16:21.763
[ZORO grunts] So. If those
guys knew where to find us,

00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.299
they must have been
following our movements

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:24.936
for a while now, is that right?

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:26.138
Uh-huh!

00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:29.177
But we've been keeping a
pretty close eye on them, too!

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:32.117
[ZORO] You mean you fairies
have a beef with Doflamingo?

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.258
That's right! Ah! Just forget
I told you that, okay?

00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.799
Dammit. It's not just the ship.
The whole crew's in danger.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.168
This is bad.

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:43.607
Hey, how far is
this Flower Field?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.442
[WICKA]
Go up those stairs there!

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.084
[WICKA]
I said go up the stairs!

00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:50.921
[ZORO gasps]

00:16:50.954 --> 00:16:53.292
[WICKA]
Wow, and I thought I was stupid.

00:16:53.326 --> 00:16:55.530
[ZORO]
Shut up!

00:16:55.563 --> 00:17:00.574
[CROWD cheers]

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:19.745
[CHIN JAO laughs]
Where's that coward hiding?

00:17:19.778 --> 00:17:21.449
I'll find him.

00:17:21.482 --> 00:17:23.920
[COMPETITOR A]
Hey, Don Chin Jao's here!

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:25.991
[COMPETITOR B]
I don't believe this!

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.326
How long must I wait?

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.199
Start the accursed
tournament already!

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:31.235
[COMPETITOR A gasps]

00:17:31.268 --> 00:17:33.840
[COMPETITOR B]
Dude, let's get outta here!

00:17:33.873 --> 00:17:35.911
Listen well, Garp's grandson.

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:38.650
That gong is the last
sound you're going to hear

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.087
before you die!

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.425
[COMPETITOR B]
Run away, hurry!

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:46.331
Get ready!

00:17:46.364 --> 00:17:49.037
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.541
[grunts]

00:17:50.574 --> 00:17:52.010
[COMPETITORS gasp]

00:17:52.043 --> 00:17:53.847
You need to calm down!

00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:57.253
Fight before the match again and
they'll kick you out for sure!

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:59.291
Don't forget why
we're here, grandpa.

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:00.927
Come on. Let's go.

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:05.369
[grunts]
I suppose you're right.

00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:07.908
[COMPETITOR B]
Whew, that was close.

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:18.128
Whoa, that guy.
He's gonna be trouble.

00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:23.439
[PIRATE A shouts]

00:18:23.472 --> 00:18:25.243
[SANJI groans]

00:18:25.276 --> 00:18:28.015
[VIOLET chuckles]

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:30.120
[VIOLET] I've read your every
thought since the moment

00:18:30.153 --> 00:18:32.290
we met, Black Leg Sanji.

00:18:32.323 --> 00:18:35.697
No one can hide from
my all-seeing eyes.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.740
[SANJI pants]

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.084
[PIRATES laughs]

00:18:46.117 --> 00:18:48.723
[VIOLET] I'd heard you had
a soft spot for women,

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:52.330
but I didn't expect it to
be that soft! How pathetic.

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:53.767
[SANJI grunts]

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.637
[VIOLET] You look
like a mess, by the way.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.676
Some prince charming,
covered in his own blood.

00:19:02.618 --> 00:19:04.621
[VIOLET]
I almost pity you.

00:19:06.225 --> 00:19:09.799
[VIOLET] You're nothing but
a failure, Black Leg Sanji.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:11.134
Be reasonable.

00:19:11.168 --> 00:19:14.909
How would a worm like you win
the heart of a woman like me?

00:19:14.942 --> 00:19:17.514
Ha! You're such a joke.

00:19:17.547 --> 00:19:19.519
[PIRATES laugh]

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:22.023
Yeah, you should've known
our Sis was way too pretty

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:24.661
to waste her time
with you, dumbass!

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:27.299
How did you not
know it was a trap?

00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:33.279
Violet. Tell me it's not true.
You wouldn't do this!

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:34.681
[gasps]

00:19:36.284 --> 00:19:38.255
[PIRATE A]
Dude, get over it already!

00:19:38.288 --> 00:19:41.328
She played you for a sap,
that's all there is to it!

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:43.733
[grunts]
They're lying.

00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.171
Deep down, you have
a beautiful, good heart.

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:47.574
I can tell.

00:19:47.607 --> 00:19:49.043
[VIOLET gasps]

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:54.755
How could you say such
a thing? After all this?

00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:56.025
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE B]
On your feet!

00:19:56.058 --> 00:19:59.397
[SANJI grunts, pants]

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:02.237
Someone must have
put you up to this.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.378
You don't... even want to be
a part of it. Do you, Violet?

00:20:06.412 --> 00:20:08.750
You still think this is
some kind of love story?

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:10.152
Gimme a break!

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:26.485
Idiot.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:27.588
[PIRATES laugh]

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.559
[PIRATE B]
Damn! That was pretty cold!

00:20:29.592 --> 00:20:31.629
[PIRATE C]
She kicked the crap out of him!

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:35.904
You're only pretending
to care about me,

00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:38.810
when really you're looking
for a chance to escape.

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:41.683
[SANJI grunts]

00:20:41.716 --> 00:20:44.855
[VIOLET] Do you honestly think
you can fool me with your lies?

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:50.399
Ha! I ate the Glare-Glare fruit.

00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:55.009
Thanks to that, I've become,
well, quite observant.

00:20:55.042 --> 00:20:57.982
I can see through anything now.

00:20:58.015 --> 00:21:00.419
You men are all liars.

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.726
[VIOLET]
Let me see inside your mind.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.964
Not that anything in it
will be worth a damn.

00:21:05.997 --> 00:21:07.066
[SANJI grunts]

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:09.237
Why did Straw Hat
join up with Law?

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.208
What do they hope to do?

00:21:11.241 --> 00:21:13.079
What brings you to Dressrosa,

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:16.552
besides the Caesar
tradeoff in Green Bit?

00:21:16.585 --> 00:21:21.128
Answer my questions,
and don't you dare lie.

00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:23.600
You don't have to speak.

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:27.708
If you won't tell me,
I'll just look inside your mind.

00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:30.814
We'll locate all your
crewmates as well.

00:21:30.848 --> 00:21:32.551
Hey, she's doin' the pose!

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:35.055
She's about to use her power!

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.537
Now! Peeping Mind!

00:21:43.773 --> 00:21:44.942
[VIOLET gasps]

00:21:56.464 --> 00:21:58.401
[VIOLET yells]

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:01.141
Wh-What's the matter?
Sis, what did you see?

00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:02.176
Yeah, what's wrong?

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.314
[gasps]
So dirty!

00:22:04.348 --> 00:22:06.619
[PIRATES]
Dirty?

00:22:06.652 --> 00:22:10.994
[VIOLET gasps]
His mind is totally pink!

00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:12.731
I've never seen
anything like it!

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:14.200
[PIRATES]
Huh?

00:22:14.233 --> 00:22:15.970
[VIOLET]
What are you up to really?

00:22:16.004 --> 00:22:17.374
What's your purpose here?

00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:19.110
What could you possibly
be thinking about

00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:20.814
at a time like this?

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:23.051
I can't begin to fathom.

00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:25.790
[SANJI grunts]
I'm thinking of you.

00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:26.626
[VIOLET]
Huh?

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:29.665
[grunts]

00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:32.738
About the way you looked at me.

00:22:32.771 --> 00:22:35.677
There is a man there
I need you to kill for me.

00:22:37.914 --> 00:22:41.188
I knew that...
you weren't lying!

00:22:41.221 --> 00:22:43.894
[SANJI grunts]
No matter what you say.

00:22:43.927 --> 00:22:47.868
No matter what anyone says,
I believe in you.

00:22:47.902 --> 00:22:52.877
For me a girl's tears
are always enough proof!

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.793
[gasps]

00:23:14.287 --> 00:23:16.257
[NARRATOR] Sanji's relentless
passion turns his

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.230
precarious situation
upside-down.

00:23:19.263 --> 00:23:21.836
Meanwhile, Usopp and Robin
are captured when they learn

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.441
that the fairies are
really miniature people.

00:23:24.474 --> 00:23:26.512
Once they awake,
they're introduced to the

00:23:26.545 --> 00:23:29.050
curious world of a lively
civilization known as

00:23:29.084 --> 00:23:30.787
the Tontatta Tribe.

00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:32.456
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:35.630
"The Unknown World!
The Tontatta Kingdom!"

00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:38.301
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
