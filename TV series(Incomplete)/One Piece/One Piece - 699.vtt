[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:40.722
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:45.832
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:48.403
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:53.547
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.052
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.466
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.969
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.785
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.492
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.664
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:21.168
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.708
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.479
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:29.553
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.690
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:33.961
Amidst the chaos, he also
put prices on the heads

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.502
of Luffy and his allies, turning
the entire kingdom against them.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:38.871
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:41.475
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.547
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.019
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:46.052 --> 00:03:48.356
I think it's time!

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.195
He's pissing me off!

00:03:51.228 --> 00:03:54.836
You moron.
That's our secret plan!

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.406
You never listen, do you?

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.615
I'm calling it! Now, Gum-Gum...

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:02.484
Ready? Shambles!

Damn it, Straw Hat!

00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.717
You really are
the worst, aren't you?

00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:23.827

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:29.271
Heh.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.885
How do ya like that, huh?

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.487

00:04:37.522 --> 00:04:41.797
[gasps] Doffy,
you okay? Answer me!

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.936
[TREBOL] You've got some
thick sludge between your ears

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.544
if you think you can
get away with this, Law!

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:53.419
[BELLAMY]
Straw Hat...

00:05:07.982 --> 00:05:12.257
[DOFLAMINGO groans] I'll admit
that was quite a blow.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.363
You see? I told you
it wouldn't kill him!

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:18.604
Now we wasted our only
chance to use that trick!

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.182
That's all you had planned out?

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:26.118
You need your egos checked.

00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:28.624
I'm not to be toyed with.

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:37.073

[yells]

00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:16.118
[FUJITORA] You might say this is
an all-or-nothing gamble for me.

00:06:17.955 --> 00:06:20.026
[FUJITORA] And the stakes
are as big as they get.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.232
I'm laying my life on
the line for this one.

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.740
I have to get my dice
in order to make my roll.

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:31.683
'Cause if I lose them, the game
is over before it even starts.

[KOALA]
Hello? Knock, knock?

00:06:34.187 --> 00:06:37.161
Can Sabo please
come out to play?

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.263
I heard you.

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.166
You liar! You were zoning out!

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.173
Your eyes have been
glossed over this whole time!

00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.979
Also. Remember,
you have a position now!

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:48.183
You can't go picking fights
with Navy Admirals

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:50.454
over personal grudges, 'kay?

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:53.459

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:00.107

cause problems for me, too!

[FUJITORA]
When all is said and done,

00:07:09.458 --> 00:07:13.501
the Navy and Doflamingo
are both unneeded here.

00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:16.138
We're birds of a
feather, if you will.

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:19.679
The Navy and I can never play
the hero for this kingdom.

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:21.683
It's simply not our place.

00:07:21.717 --> 00:07:24.522
What if someone catches
on to your rationale?

00:07:24.556 --> 00:07:25.991
[FUJITORA]
They won't.

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:29.666
All they'll see is that I hit
a snag getting' past you.

Why are you always so stubborn?

00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:55.050
Don't you realize that you're
always making Hack and myself

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:57.020
clean up after your
self-indulgent messes?

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.660
Don't you even have the tiniest
bit of sympathy for us?

Okay, it's done.

[TOWNSMAN D] We'll lure

with the ones we already caught.

00:09:00.079 --> 00:09:01.983
Wait a sec! We're using
them as hostages

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:04.354
so we can end this game
without any more killing!

We don't want them to die!

[PIRATE B] Doflamingo will
murder 'em in the end!

We've had a decade-long
grudge against King Riku,

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:13.145
but how could we do this to him

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:16.084
when he's a victim
of Doflamingo, too?

00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:20.326
We're all ashamed we
participated in this awful game.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.332
I can't believe we
praised that evil pirate.

00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:26.272
And even after we learned
the truth about what he did

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:31.115
to our loved ones,
and how he enslaved them...

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:32.986
[TOWNSMAN P]
We were still seeking salvation

00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:35.490
from that deceitful bastard!

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:37.261
We're all so confused.

00:11:37.294 --> 00:11:40.734
We still don't know
what we're supposed to do.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:43.807
[TOWNSMAN P]
What's gonna happen to us?

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:46.445
What's gonna happen
to our kingdom?

00:11:52.491 --> 00:11:56.733
Please save us, King Riku!

00:11:58.436 --> 00:11:59.539
[USOPP]
What in the heck?

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:00.842
A change of heart, I presume?

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.411
They have taken knee?

00:12:02.444 --> 00:12:03.880

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:08.557
[TOWNSMAN P] King Riku! Please
tell us what we should do!

[TOWNSMAN Q] If you propose
we fight, we shall take up arms!

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:13.098
[TOWNSMAN R]
Please, King Riku!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.434

[TOWNSPEOPLE crying]

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:28.429
In that event,
I say we stay put.

00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:30.399
Huh? Why's that?

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:37.113
If it's necessary, we can brace
ourselves for death later.

00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:41.222
[DOLDO] Why place your faith
in them? They're criminals.

00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:42.424
That's fine.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:45.731
Our kingdom must be broken
down and its lies exposed.

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.668
They'll do that.

00:12:47.702 --> 00:12:50.707
I trust them to end
this false peace.

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:53.613
So, I'm betting everything
on the Straw Hats.

00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:54.816
Their leader.

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:57.020
He acts on the goodness
inside his heart.

00:12:57.053 --> 00:13:00.560
Even though he's a pirate,
he hasn't lost his humanity!

00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:06.205
[DOLDO] Without realizing it,
it seems that I have come to

00:13:06.238 --> 00:13:09.177
believe in Luffy's
victory as well.

00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:23.005
[ALL gasp]

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.343
[TOWNSMAN T]
It's Admiral Fujitora!

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.030
[FUJITORA] Historically,
Dressrosa has stood

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:36.599
as a symbol of peace.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:40.507
I'll be damned if I see this
kingdom fall into war again.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.643
Why is he here?

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:44.314
We can't catch a break, huh?

00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:03.285
[FUJITORA]
King Riku, sir.

00:14:04.454 --> 00:14:06.693
[FUJITORA] It seems like
we're both about to "go all in"

00:14:06.727 --> 00:14:09.197
on this high-stakes game.

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:24.528
One for Straw Hat.

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:28.268
[FUJITORA]
All or nothing.

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:36.384
[yells]

00:14:41.896 --> 00:14:44.935
[LUFFY yells]

00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:58.228
[LUFFY] Did you even
think of the kingdom?

00:14:58.262 --> 00:15:01.268
If we chicken out now,
what'll happen to it?

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:05.945
Special! Long-Range
Attack! Bag Worm!

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:07.815
Cien Fleurs!

00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:10.788
Here comes another
"Strong Right"!

00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:12.390
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style!

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:15.731
One Thousand Eighty
Caliber Phoenix!

00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:17.233
[ZORO grunts]

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.888
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:30.761
Keep laughing. I'll mess you up!

00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:33.533
Mingo!

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.803
Keep laughing. I'll mess you up!

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:54.208
Mingo!

00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.646
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:15:58.182 --> 00:15:59.752
[DOFLAMINGO]
Bullet String!

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:03.058
[yells]

00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:04.562
Have another.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:06.900
[screams]

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.469
[TREBOL gasps]

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:12.578
Serves 'em, right!
Yeah! Go, Doffy!

00:16:14.314 --> 00:16:18.957
Hey! We know all about how
your ability operates, Law.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.830
Heh. You must have forgotten
that we had our eyes

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:25.469
on the Op-Op Fruit
for quite some time now!

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.780
You can chop me up
into a million pieces,

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:32.819
but I'm gonna
turn back to normal.

00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:35.322
Now I'm ready for round two!

00:16:35.356 --> 00:16:36.492
Huh?

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:39.264
[gasps] Oh no, no, no!

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:41.434
[TREBOL gasps]

00:16:43.138 --> 00:16:46.044
What the hell? What'd you do?

00:16:46.077 --> 00:16:47.815
[LAW]
You finally noticed.

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:49.552
The Radio Knife
doesn't work the same

00:16:49.586 --> 00:16:51.722
as my regular Amputation.

00:16:51.756 --> 00:16:52.824
For the next few minutes,

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:55.163
you'll be unable
to use your ability.

00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:57.200
You might as well relax.

00:16:57.234 --> 00:16:58.503
You're not going anywhere.

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:01.241
[TREBOL]
Seriously? Trebol's in trouble!

00:17:01.275 --> 00:17:05.182
[yells] My nose is runny!

00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:08.924
Come on, wait! At least
let me get a tissue!

00:17:08.957 --> 00:17:11.830
I'm in a sticky situation here!

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.600
Dammit, you!

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:19.745
Gum-Gum Pistol!

00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:27.426
[LUFFY gasping]

00:17:29.866 --> 00:17:31.836
Hey hey, have mercy
on me here, Law!

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.844
Don't you remember all the nice
things we did for you as a kid?

00:17:35.878 --> 00:17:37.313
[LAW]
Room!

00:17:38.449 --> 00:17:39.853
[TREBOL]
Stop, you ungrateful traitor!

00:17:39.886 --> 00:17:42.558
Don't you dare come near me!

00:17:42.592 --> 00:17:44.294
Injection.

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:48.468
Snot Blade-Catcher, A-choo!

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.012
[LAW]
Shot!

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.014
[TREBOL screams]

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.684
[LAW]
And the finisher.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.261
[TREBOL laughs]

00:18:02.898 --> 00:18:04.601
Fallbright!

00:18:10.613 --> 00:18:12.249
[gasps] Traffy!

00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:13.820
[DOFLAMINGO]
I won't forgive anyone

00:18:13.854 --> 00:18:16.291
who messes with my Family!

00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:20.133
[DOFLAMINGO]
Do you recall what I hate

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:23.472
more than anything else
in the world, Law?

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:29.819
It's being looked
down on, remember?

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.656
Don't you dare!

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.366
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:18:41.842 --> 00:18:43.780
[LUFFY gasps]

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.953
[gasps] What happened?

00:18:46.986 --> 00:18:49.625
What's going on with my body?

00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:54.434
[gasps]

00:18:57.139 --> 00:19:00.079
[groans] Please,
Doflamingo, stop!

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:02.450
[chuckles]

00:19:05.456 --> 00:19:08.863
[BELLAMY gasps]
I'll cut you! Stay away!

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:11.202
Please listen to me!

00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:13.239
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:16.078
I can't stop!
I don't wanna hurt you!

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:17.647
You've got to dodge me!

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:18.517
[LUFFY]
Bellamy!

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.121
No. No!

00:19:21.154 --> 00:19:22.858
[LAW]
Dammit, Straw Hat!

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:36.919
[TREBOL laughs]
You beat them all!

00:19:38.489 --> 00:19:40.393
[DOFLAMINGO]
Knowing what I'm capable of,

00:19:40.426 --> 00:19:43.165
did you really believe
you could beat me?

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:44.903
The fact that you
wretched little brats

00:19:44.936 --> 00:19:46.405
thought I was so weak

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:50.013
that I would fall to you and
your pathetic surprise attack.

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.248
Well, I find that to be

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:54.555
the highest form of
disrespect imaginable.

00:19:56.726 --> 00:19:58.563
You're so screwed.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.434
Let me tell you,

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:05.643
I descend from the noblest
of bloodlines in the world.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.852
The Celestial Dragons!

00:20:09.886 --> 00:20:11.221
[LUFFY]
Huh?!

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.325
[gasps]

00:20:14.294 --> 00:20:18.235
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Just the fact I exist

00:20:18.268 --> 00:20:20.740
makes me deserving
of admiration.

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:25.049
I possessed the rarest
of powers known to man.

00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:31.729
[COMMONERS laughing]

00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:43.519
[DOFLAMINGO screams]

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:52.136
[DOFLAMINGO] However,
my worthless father abandoned

00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:55.209
the greatest birthright
in the world.

00:20:55.242 --> 00:20:57.881
Our priceless divine nobility.

00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:00.453
Then our fate was sealed.

00:21:00.486 --> 00:21:02.490
My whole family was
sentenced to suffer

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:06.064
among the commoners
in this rotten cesspool.

00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:11.074
[DOFLAMINGO] "Live like
a human," he would squawk.

00:21:11.107 --> 00:21:13.044
Well, screw that!

00:21:14.882 --> 00:21:17.855
[DOFLAMINGO] My father was
nothing but an imbecile.

00:21:17.888 --> 00:21:22.664
Come on, kids. Let's go.
We'll live humbly.

00:21:33.018 --> 00:21:36.391
[DOFLAMINGO] What did he
think was going to happen?

00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:39.364
Hiya, Daddy!

00:21:39.397 --> 00:21:41.000
Where did all the slaves go?

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:43.038
Hey! Let's buy some more?

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:44.473
Um, Daddy?

00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:47.581
Why are they not
kneeling before me?

00:21:47.614 --> 00:21:51.623
Daddy, why? Everyone
is coming after us!

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:53.894
[COMMONER A] They're a family
of Celestial Dragons!

00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:56.832
Don't kill 'em! Let's make
them suffer instead!

00:21:56.865 --> 00:21:59.872
[COMMONERS yell]

00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:07.119
[DOFLAMINGO cackling]

00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:09.859
At the young age of ten,

00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:13.332
I experienced both Heaven
and Hell, firsthand.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:16.672
I took it upon myself
to end my suffering,

00:22:16.706 --> 00:22:21.047
by bringing the head of my own
father back to Marie Jois!

00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:26.458
[DOFLAMINGO] But can you believe
that the Celestial Dragons

00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:28.729
would tell a ten-year-old boy
they wouldn't take back

00:22:28.763 --> 00:22:31.502
someone from
a "line of traitors"?

00:22:31.535 --> 00:22:35.510
It was then that I found
there was no escaping this hell.

00:22:35.544 --> 00:22:38.617
From that moment
forward I swore

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.456
that I would destroy
everything they held dear.

00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:46.832
To put it frankly,
every damn thing in the world!

00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:55.583
The lives you've led
cannot possibly

00:22:55.617 --> 00:22:59.056
be compared to what
I've been through.

00:23:00.794 --> 00:23:02.964
I'm not wasting my
time screwing around

00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:05.035
with brats like you.

00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.106
It's below me!

00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:16.358
[NARRATOR] Facing Doflamingo,
a villain cunning enough

00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.562
to manipulate the
World Government itself,

00:23:18.596 --> 00:23:20.333
Luffy and Law
find their situation

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:22.069
going from bad to worse.

00:23:22.102 --> 00:23:23.807
As their execution draws near,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.077
the history of the
Op-Op Fruit is revealed,

00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:29.718
along with the tale of how Law
acquired it so many years ago.

00:23:29.752 --> 00:23:31.487
[LUFFY]
On the Next One Piece!

00:23:31.522 --> 00:23:35.162
"The Ultimate Power!
The Secret of the Op-Op Fruit!"

00:23:35.195 --> 00:23:38.068
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
