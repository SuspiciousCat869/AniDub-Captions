WEBVTT

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:45.631
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.203
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.442
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.346
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:55.852
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.918 --> 00:02:58.658
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.932
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.435
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:08.442
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.662 --> 00:03:20.400
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats formed
a pirate alliance with Law

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.973
and defeated
the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.477
who had seized
control of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.518
Now, at last,
the kingdom is at peace.

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:31.222
However, in the
aftermath of the battle,

00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:33.794
the Navy Admiral Fujitora
sweeps in to capture

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:37.635
every pirate on the island
before they can escape.

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:41.442
[LUFFY]
"No way Out!

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.949
Admiral Fujitora's
Ruthless Pursuit!"

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:51.296
[gasps]

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.600
Look! There he is, Hajrudin!

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:58.342
[LUFFY yells]

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:04.689
[LUFFY]
Hey! Put me down!

00:04:04.756 --> 00:04:06.726
[CAVENDISH]
Take him to the ship!

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:13.040
Nice try, Luffy.
Now it's my turn.

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:14.208
We're done with that!

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:16.378
It's time to run away,
Mister Zoro!

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:18.951
We got this whole operation
we're pullin' off here!

00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:20.521
Oh yeah?

00:04:21.322 --> 00:04:22.725
[FARUL neighs]

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.665
So, uh, are we all cramming
onto one ship at the port,

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:26.967
because that's
kind of dangerous.

00:04:27.034 --> 00:04:30.106
Not the port.
Our destination is further out.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.943
Just look ahead.

00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.049
[USOPP]
Huh?

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:39.324
Whoa. What the heck?

00:04:43.466 --> 00:04:46.105
[USOPP] You've got like a whole
fleet forming a line!

00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:47.942
How far out does this go?

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.478
[ORLUMBUS]
Over three miles!

00:04:49.546 --> 00:04:53.352
The ships that we'll be taking
are hidden in the fog ahead.

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:58.730
We'll cross this
connecting bridge

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:02.237
made by my Yontamaria Fleet,
and board the ships at sea!

00:05:02.304 --> 00:05:03.875
[USOPP]
You made your own dock?

00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.376
[ORLUMBUS]
In a sense, yes.

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.551
Those are 50 Nitamaria
vessels you see before you.

00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:10.555
They've extended ropes
to a bridge sturdy enough

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.257
to support even
our most sizeable

00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:14.596
of allies in their escape.

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:26.820
[YONTAMARIA FLEET cheering]

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:30.193
Hey! I'm not done
fighting the old guy yet!

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.563
Let me go!

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.501
[CAVENDISH] Can you be
reasonable just this once?

00:05:33.568 --> 00:05:36.373
[LUFFY] I said I
wouldn't run! I gotta fight!

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:39.846
We have a mission.
You can fight next time.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.855
[FUJITORA] If you think
I'll simply let you escape,

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:03.025
you're mistaken.

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:36.727
[FUJITORA]
Whether you fight or you flee,

00:06:36.794 --> 00:06:40.466
it's already too late
for you, Straw Hat.

00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:17.040
You guys hear that, right?

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.237
[USOPP gasps]

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:08.409
That admiral really
wants our asses dead!

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:10.347
[JEET]
Move it or lose it, everybody!

00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:12.852
[ABDULLAH laughs]

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:39.772
[gasps] The rubble seems
to be floating out to sea!

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:49.659
But why?

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:52.097
[VIOLET]
It's following after Straw Hat.

00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:53.767
[gasps]

00:08:58.176 --> 00:08:59.879
There's no way.

00:09:13.439 --> 00:09:17.214
[FUJITORA] I know how you must
feel right now, Straw Hat.

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:20.555
Although I cannot see
the havoc I have wrought,

00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:23.694
I know it looms heavily
before your eyes.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.504
A dark sky that suffocates
any hope for escape.

00:09:28.571 --> 00:09:30.574
The moment you try to set sail,

00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:33.146
this rubble will fall
like an endless rain,

00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:37.187
sinking every ship
into the abyss below.

00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:40.594
[FUJITORA]
Surely you must know.

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:43.834
Even if, by some miracle,
you do escape me,

00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.174
the Four Emperors will
hound your every step.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.915
By defeating Joker, you've put
a target on your back.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:52.819
Your life will be a living hell,

00:09:52.886 --> 00:09:56.258
until at last,
they claim your neck.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.233
[FUJITORA] You took pity on me
for my blindness,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.636
but the truth is,

00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:05.912
this was an injury that
I brought upon myself.

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:09.084
These eyes were closed
by my own actions,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.791
because they saw too many things
that I didn't care for.

00:10:12.858 --> 00:10:16.666
Things that I
wished they hadn't.

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:22.912
All right.

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:33.720
Are we gonna be able to
outrun this or what?

00:11:33.787 --> 00:11:36.993
I don't want to be
crushed to death by trash!

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:45.343
If you're so intent on
making your way to hell,

00:11:45.409 --> 00:11:48.015
then allow me to guide you.

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:05.049
[FUJITORA]
This is the end of your story.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:19.111
Huh?

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:21.883
[TOWNSMAN A]
Give us back Rebecca, Lucy!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.787
[TOWNSMAN B] We thought
you were our hero, damn it!

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:26.259
What happened?

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:27.528
Is that...?

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:29.900
[TOWNSMAN C] This kingdom
has made her suffer enough!

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:33.005
Whatever you're planning,
we're gonna stop it!

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.715
I'm sorry to say,
there are only criminals ahead.

00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:40.186
You fine people are making
a terrible mistake

00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:41.422
by coming here.

00:12:41.488 --> 00:12:43.392
Allow me to handle this.

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:44.394
If you don't stop, they--

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.164
[TOWNSMAN D]
Move it, Navy!

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.670
[TOWNSMAN E]
We don't need your help!

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:50.006
This is our kingdom!

00:12:50.072 --> 00:12:53.112
We'll take care of
the pirates ourselves!

00:12:58.022 --> 00:12:59.157
Huh?

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:02.497
Huh? It's not falling!

00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:40.774
Father. They townspeople,
they're--

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.212
[DOLDO]
Hm? What is it?

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.983
[VIOLET]
They're running to Straw Hat.

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:47.353
There are thousands of them.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.455
[DOLDO]
What?

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:50.661
[JEET] What's all that
commotion back there?

00:13:50.727 --> 00:13:53.900
The people of Dressrosa!
But what do you think they want?

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.704
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:59.477
That's weird.
C'mon, Giant! Let me go!

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.752
Would you just
give it up already?

00:14:02.819 --> 00:14:05.423
I'm not gonna fight him, okay?

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:10.901
Huh?

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:20.621
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:14:20.688 --> 00:14:23.225
What's everybody yellin' about?

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:43.265
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:45.670
[TOWNSMAN F] You better
prepare yourself, Lucy!

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:47.173
[TOWNSMAN G]
Don't let 'em escape!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.944
[TOWNSMAN H] You're gonna
pay for this! Damn pirates!

00:14:49.011 --> 00:14:51.148
[TOWNSMAN I]
We're taking Rebecca back!

00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:53.018
Lucy!

00:14:56.491 --> 00:14:58.028
[TOWNSMAN J]
Lucy!

00:14:58.095 --> 00:15:00.299
[TOWNSMAN K]
We're gonna get you!

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:03.439
[TOWNSMAN J] Get the ships!
Chase him out to sea!

00:15:09.885 --> 00:15:11.989
[FUJITORA]
What is this?

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:19.371
[TOWNSMAN L]
Lucy!

00:15:19.438 --> 00:15:21.943
[TOWNSMAN M]
You can't get away!

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:23.412
[FUJITORA]
Despite their words,

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:26.118
I don't sense
a hint of animosity.

00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:29.725
[TOWNSMAN N] Give back Rebecca,
or we'll give you a wallop!

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:30.894
[TOWNSGIRL A]
Hey, you guys!

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.032
I saw Rebecca
at the top of the hill!

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:35.637
She's safe with Kyros!

00:15:37.274 --> 00:15:40.881
[TOWNSMAN O chuckles] Don't
worry, we know! Just have fun!

00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:42.450
[TOWNSGIRL A]
Huh?

00:15:42.518 --> 00:15:44.087
[TOWNSMAN P]
Nobody talks about it,

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:46.358
but Kyros is Rebecca's father.

00:15:46.425 --> 00:15:49.532
She's probably going to
live with him from now on.

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:53.105
[TOWNSMAN P] They used to
live together as a family

00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:56.111
with Scarlet in that
little cottage on the hill.

00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:57.982
All the adults in the kingdom
have known that

00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:00.988
for 16 years now.

00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:02.157
[TOWNSMAN O]
Of course, we knew the truth

00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:03.760
about the fairies, too,

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:05.998
but we kept the secret
to protect them.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.668
[TOWNSGIRL A]
Really?

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:10.005
[TOWNSMAN P] Anyway, those
pirates saved the kingdom,

00:16:10.072 --> 00:16:13.111
so now it's our turn
to save them!

00:16:14.982 --> 00:16:16.418
[TOWNSMAN P]
If we stick close to Lucy,

00:16:16.485 --> 00:16:20.026
Fujitora won't be able to
drop the rubble from the sky!

00:16:20.794 --> 00:16:24.034
[TOWNSMAN Q] We're coming, Lucy!
You better get ready!

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.706
[TOWNSMAN R]
You're in real trouble now!

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:29.679
[GYATS]
All right, everybody!

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:31.281
Let's get to that east port!

00:16:31.348 --> 00:16:33.185
We have to give the heroes
who saved our kingdom

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:35.524
a proper sendoff!

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:36.560
Let's hurry!

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:39.565
This is your last chance.
Make it count!

00:16:39.632 --> 00:16:42.470
Run to the sea!

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.818
Wouldya look at that!

00:17:05.885 --> 00:17:08.556
It's like the whole city
came out for us!

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.369
[USOPP chuckles]

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:25.724
[FUJITORA] You're a fool,
Straw Hat, but an honest one.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.495
[FUJITORA] I suppose
I shouldn't be surprised

00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:31.669
that everyone wants
to take your side.

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:38.415
[FUJITORA] What kind of
a man are you, I wonder?

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:41.923
[FUJITORA]
What's the color of your hair?

00:17:41.989 --> 00:17:44.628
The shape of your eyes?

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:51.474
[FUJITORA]
What does your smile look like?

00:17:54.748 --> 00:17:55.851
What a pity.

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:59.124
Wish I could use
these eyes one last time

00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:03.533
to see the face
of a man like you.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.375
[FUJITORA] I'm sure it's
filled to brim with kindness.

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:24.073
[FUJITORA]
Now, what shall I do with

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.245
this unsightly weapon
I've raised?

00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:28.783
I look like quite the fool.

00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:35.330
[MARINE A]
All Marines have retreated,

00:18:35.396 --> 00:18:37.601
but the citizens are
running to the port!

00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:40.741
[BASTILLE] What the hell
is Issho doing down there?

00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:44.114
Are you gonna keep that
rubble in the sky all day?

00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:47.020
Check this out!

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:49.658
[ALL]
Aw man, it's huge!

00:19:08.596 --> 00:19:10.466
[BARTOLOMEO] Is that an
awesome ship, or what?

00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.270
[CAVENDISH]
It's not even yours!

00:19:12.337 --> 00:19:13.540
[BARTOLOMEO]
Okay, we better get aboard

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:16.145
before the sky falls
on us or whatever.

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:17.748
I'll show you my ship later.

00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:19.852
You're gonna flip out.

00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:23.960
[LUFFY, USOPP]
It's like a castle!

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.333
Straw Hat.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.038
I have four friends who are
Giant mercenaries like me.

00:19:30.105 --> 00:19:31.475
I want to reach out
to all the other

00:19:31.543 --> 00:19:33.780
giant tribes and form a crew.

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:36.586
Then, we'll shake the
foundations of this world.

00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:41.261
Just like the famous Giant
Pirates did in the past!

00:19:41.328 --> 00:19:42.497
Remember, Luffy?

00:19:42.564 --> 00:19:44.367
That was Master Dorry
and Brogy's crew,

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:45.737
in their glory days!

00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:47.007
Oh, that's cool.

00:19:47.073 --> 00:19:48.442
He'll be a good rival, then!

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:50.647
Well, I can't wait to see
your crew when it's done.

00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:53.619
Yeah, and I can't wait
to see Elbaph someday!

00:19:53.686 --> 00:19:56.191
My Yontamaria Fleet
is at your call.

00:19:56.258 --> 00:19:58.897
Our forces number
56 ships, y'know!

00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:00.400
Should come in handy!

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.769
[ROBIN]
Is that so?

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:04.575
Luffyland! We just got
permission from our chief!

00:20:04.642 --> 00:20:06.979
We want to join up
with you, too!

00:20:07.046 --> 00:20:08.215
[LUFFY]
"Join up"?

00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:10.119
I won't lose to anyone
in a boxing ring,

00:20:10.186 --> 00:20:13.359
but if I can't take on pirates,
I'll never be a true champion.

00:20:13.426 --> 00:20:15.229
I agreed, so we're teamin' up.

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:16.766
We'll see where
the waves take us.

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:18.503
[ABDULLAH, JEET]
Hey, don't forget about us!

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.640
We've got your back, pal!

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:23.378
This idiot is letting me
on his ship for some reason.

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:25.750
I'm helping you out.
Call me "Captain" at least!

00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:29.390
As for you, I still have
more experience as a pirate.

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:32.430
So when we team up,
I'm sure to be the popular one!

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:35.069
I'm not asking for
help from anybody.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.006
You guys can do
whatever you want.

00:20:37.072 --> 00:20:39.512
[JEET] Well, that's the thing,
we kind of hit it off

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:41.415
while we were all
staying at the palace

00:20:41.482 --> 00:20:43.686
and decided to run with this.

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:44.420
[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:46.391
Let me introduce the team.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:49.631
We chose the order
by drawing straws.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:56.311
[ORLUMBUS] First, the Beautiful
Pirates, with 75 members.

00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:59.751
Their Captain is Cavendish
of the White Horse!

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:09.572
[ORLUMBUS] Next, the Barto Club,
with 56 members.

00:21:09.639 --> 00:21:14.380
Their captain is
Bartolomeo the Cannibal!

00:21:16.553 --> 00:21:21.294
[ORLUMBUS] Then, the Happosui
Army, a thousand men strong!

00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:25.737
Their 13th leader is Don Sai!

00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:30.346
[CHIN JAO chuckles]
Has a nice ring to it.

00:21:30.412 --> 00:21:32.150
You're looking good, honey!

00:21:32.216 --> 00:21:34.521
Oh, I can't help myself!

00:21:35.556 --> 00:21:37.928
[ORLUMBUS] Next, The Triple X
Gym Fighting Alliance,

00:21:37.995 --> 00:21:40.734
with four members!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.608
They're lead by
"Destruction Cannon" Ideo!

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.423
[ORLUMBUS] Then we have the
Tonta Corps with 200 members.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.663
Their leader is Leo the Warrior!

00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:02.577
[ORLUMBUS] Then we have
the soon-to-be Giant Pirates--

00:22:02.644 --> 00:22:05.416
Five members and growing!

00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:08.421
Their captain is Hajrudin!

00:22:11.862 --> 00:22:13.465
[ORLUMBUS]
Last, but not least,

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:19.144
Commodore of the Yontamaria
Fleet, with 4,300 members.

00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:22.316
The "Adventuring Pioneer,"
Orlumbus!

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.788
That's me!

00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:28.597
Uh, what's wrong?

00:22:28.663 --> 00:22:31.536
A force of 5,600 total!

00:22:31.603 --> 00:22:35.276
Mister Luffy, exchange cups
with the leaders of each crew!

00:22:35.342 --> 00:22:38.381
We'll drink ritual saké
as father and son!

00:22:38.448 --> 00:22:40.285
'Kay, how does that work?

00:22:40.352 --> 00:22:42.056
[BARTOLOMEO] In a crew,
the boss is the father,

00:22:42.123 --> 00:22:43.660
and his men are the sons!

00:22:43.727 --> 00:22:45.664
As leader of the
Straw Hat Pirates,

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.235
we humbly ask you to
take us under your wing.

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:50.138
So, do you accept?

00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:01.528
[USOPP gasps]

00:23:14.722 --> 00:23:16.725
[NARRATOR] Luffy and the
fighters from the coliseum

00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:20.099
have overcome Doflamingo
and formed a powerful bond.

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:21.335
The formidable leaders

00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.305
from seven different
trouble-making crews

00:23:23.372 --> 00:23:25.810
raise their cups in honor
of their new boss,

00:23:25.877 --> 00:23:29.283
forming an alliance that will
surely go down in history.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.854
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:34.293
"Sons' Cups!
The Straw Hat Fleet is Formed!"

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.534
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
