WEBVTT

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.548
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:45.765
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:48.403
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.610
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.677 --> 00:02:53.547
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:55.986
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.052 --> 00:02:58.825
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.299
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:04.702
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.644
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.219
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:17.361
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:19.231
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.801
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:24.442
and launched an attack
on Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.549
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:31.322
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.794
Locked in battle with
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:36.700
the Straw Hats take
them down one by one.

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.374
Meanwhile, Luffy and Law's
final showdown with Doflamingo

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.315
is gearing up for
a climatic conclusion.

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:45.552
[KYROS]
The kingdom has long suffered

00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:47.522
under Doflamingo's clutches.

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:50.862
It shall either be liberated
and returned to King Riku

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.901
or once again fall into despair.

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:59.880
[KYROS] Our last line of hope
lies among a pirate crew now.

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:02.051
Is that so?

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.687
Lucy.

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:09.498
[BELLAMY] I ain't gonna turn
my back on him even if I croak!

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:12.371
If that's what it takes
to get him to respect me,

00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:14.543
then I'm gonna do it!

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.952
You big liar!
This isn't about loyalty!

00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:21.322
It's about your pride!

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:25.130
If you have it all figured out,

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:27.435
then shut up and
fight me already!

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.606
You'll die for nothing!

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:30.841
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:36.654
[BELLAMY] This is the
end of the road for me.

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:39.860
[BELLAMY]
No, this is what I want.

00:04:39.927 --> 00:04:42.331
To be killed...

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:45.605
...by the only other man
I ever respected.

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:48.944
One last chance
to do this, Straw Hat!

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:51.448
[BELLAMY]
Thank you.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:54.822
Thank you for
calling me a friend.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.733
[panting]

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:32.063
[LUFFY yelling]

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:38.109
Doflamingo!

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.457
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:49.031
I can hear the howling
of a wild cur.

00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:52.772
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why don't you limp on up here?

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.882
[DOFLAMINGO] Hey, Law,
your buddy's on his way.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.983
[VIOLET] He can proceed.
He has taken down Bellamy!

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.352
Well done.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.223
Now there're only two
higher-ups left remaining.

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.960
Keep strong, Straw Hat.

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:22.164
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:23.835
[VIOLET]
He's making great strides.

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:26.607
However, the final
obstacles awaiting him

00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:30.046
are Trebol and, of course,
Doflamingo himself.

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:33.754
As Roronoa Zoro told us,
we can't be at ease yet.

00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.192
However, it does feel
as if the tides

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:37.996
may be turning in our favor!

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:39.131
I hope!

00:06:39.197 --> 00:06:43.039
We're almost there!
When he wins, we're free.

00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:51.156
[VIOLET gasps]
No!

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:54.696
Viola? Something wrong?

00:06:58.937 --> 00:06:59.973
[USOPP]
Viola?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.812
I have terrible news.
We're down a man, too.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.215
[USOPP, KIN'EMON, HACK]
Huh?

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.222
What's that mean?
Is someone in trouble?

00:07:11.362 --> 00:07:14.001
Who's hurt? Say it.

00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:16.874
[VIOLET]
It's Trafalgar Law!

00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.848
-[USOPP gasps]
-Impossible! Sir Law?

00:07:51.977 --> 00:07:55.585
[laughing]

00:07:55.651 --> 00:07:58.122
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:03.867
Your buddy's on his way, Law.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.771
This'll be good.

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.210
He'll be surprised to see you.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:10.881
Or rather, your corpse.

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:21.870
Sticky Launcher!

00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:22.938
[groans]

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.919
[DOFLAMINGO]
Take it easy, Law. Rest.

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:40.908
Clearly, you've lost this.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:42.812
Even your cheap tricks
can't give you

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.350
the edge you need
to challenge me.

00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.692
Fight both of us?
What were you thinking?

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:53.165
C'mon! I'm more than
enough for you.

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:58.175
[groans]

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:00.648
And Straw Hat?

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:04.288
He's a bit busy. Still.

00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:05.791
Shame he doesn't have the guts

00:09:05.858 --> 00:09:09.031
to put that so-called "friend"
of his out of his misery.

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:12.605
Otherwise,
he might've saved you.

00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:17.615
[TREBOL laughs]
What a poor naive dolt!

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:20.187
You can't catch that break, huh?

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:22.358
Tough luck! Tough luck!

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:25.764
Your life is a tragedy.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.338
Born into the hell
known as White Town.

00:09:29.906 --> 00:09:33.847
[DOFLAMINGO] A bleak future
awaited you since boyhood.

00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:36.787
[DOFLAMINGO]
Then, in a twist of fate,

00:09:36.854 --> 00:09:40.193
you were led to
my younger brother, Corazon.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.700
Which managed to draw your
life out a bit longer.

00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:46.973
But now you're nothing more
than his vindictive ghost-

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.315
a revenge-driven fool,
kept alive by hatred alone.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:54.923
So sad! Boohoo!

00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:57.662
Though, for a man
on borrowed time,

00:09:57.729 --> 00:09:58.964
I'll hand it to you.

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:00.901
You've really made
the most out of

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.173
the rotten hand fate dealt you.

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:06.713
Still, all things must end.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.721
Your tenacity
won't save you now.

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:13.193
Thirteen years down the drain.

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:15.998
I do pity you, in a way.

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:17.902
A wasted life.

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:21.643
[laughs]

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.883
Within moments,
you'll be food for the worms.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.022
You worked hard, but for what?

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:32.998
Well, it doesn't
have to be for nothing.

00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:39.077
[DOFLAMINGO]
Trafalgar D. Water Law.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:45.056
C'mon, don't let
that power go to waste.

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:48.897
This is your final shot.
So listen.

00:10:48.964 --> 00:10:52.805
You've been given a chance
to change this world.

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:56.713
So. Do the Perpetual
Youth Surgery.

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:02.458
Put that Op-Op Fruit to
good use, then you die. And...

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:04.294
Since I'm a fair man,

00:11:04.361 --> 00:11:08.402
in exchange, I'll grant you
whatever you desire.

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:11.174
[TREBOL]
Now that's generous!

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:21.461
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:27.340
Anything?

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:29.946
That's right.

00:11:30.012 --> 00:11:32.751
I mean, that would be...

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:38.462
...a tough deal for me to pass.

00:11:41.368 --> 00:11:43.840
[LAW]
All right. I'm in.

00:11:43.907 --> 00:11:48.082
[TREBOL laughs] You're smarter
than I thought, Law.

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:49.017
Helping us out.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.357
Doffy's gonna be
eternally grateful!

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:53.960
[LAW]
Whatever.

00:11:54.027 --> 00:11:58.169
My wish is for you
to bring back Cora.

00:11:59.004 --> 00:12:01.876
[LAW] And when you're done,
I want you to lick the asses

00:12:01.943 --> 00:12:04.849
of every last person
in this kingdom.

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:07.454
You think I'm no match for you?

00:12:07.522 --> 00:12:11.128
It's all in the bag?
What a joke.

00:12:11.195 --> 00:12:13.900
Here's the truth, Doflamingo.

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:17.373
When you lose,
don't act shocked.

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:19.311
[LAW] The Straw Hat
Pirates have performed

00:12:19.377 --> 00:12:22.484
countless miracles
along their journeys.

00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:27.394
[LAW] Someone like you never
had a chance of stopping them.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:33.473
Also, you're wrong if you think
you can get Caesar back!

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.145
Hey! Law! Show respect!

00:12:36.212 --> 00:12:39.084
That's Doffy you're talking to!

00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:40.821
[LAW]
And what you don't realize

00:12:40.888 --> 00:12:43.392
is that it's your head
on the chopping bl-

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:53.412
[panting]

00:12:56.552 --> 00:12:58.456
Just had to run your mouth.

00:12:58.524 --> 00:13:01.294
A wise-ass, to the bitter end.

00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:08.175
[groaning]

00:13:10.882 --> 00:13:12.952
Law, your jacket.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.022
It says "Corazon."

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:17.529
Are you mocking me?

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:19.397
And the "Heart Pirates"?

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.135
You think I didn't notice?

00:13:21.202 --> 00:13:23.507
What're you trying to say here?

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.380
[DOFLAMINGO] You refused
to accept the heart seat.

00:13:27.447 --> 00:13:31.455
Then you bear the mark
of the heart anyway?

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:33.560
Why?!

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:49.391
[DOFLAMINGO panting]
How insufferable.

00:13:55.036 --> 00:13:57.641
Law. Corazon.

00:13:57.708 --> 00:13:59.846
That's enough.

00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:01.916
This ends here.

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:06.626
Your crusade is dead and gone.

00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:16.512
I'm finally free of
this burden! I'm free!

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:22.558
Traffy... is dead?

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:25.496
[VIOLET]
After getting shot like that,

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.102
there's no chance he survived.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.350
King Riku?

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.155
Despite our victories,
the kingdom is in great danger.

00:15:28.222 --> 00:15:31.763
Let's go. Citizens may
still require our aid.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.567
We can't rest yet!

00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.470
Sir! I'm coming!

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:36.506
Uh, me too!

00:15:36.573 --> 00:15:38.744
I'm joining! Count me in!

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.046
Me, too!

00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:42.585
[TANK] Very well!
Let us descend into town.

00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.624
It is not too late to minimize
the casualties further!

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.030
True! Even if we can't fight,
we can still help out!

00:15:49.097 --> 00:15:51.168
[TOWNSMAN E]
Yeah! Let's go!

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:05.997
[DOFLAMINGO panting]

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.210
Doffy?

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:19.390
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:16:20.827 --> 00:16:22.230
I'm fine.

00:16:22.297 --> 00:16:25.805
Someday we'll get our hands
on the Op-Op Fruit again.

00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:30.012
Yeah, you're right! [laughs]

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:33.218
So. What's the next step?

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.899
[DOFLAMINGO]
Let's wrap this up.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.237
Sound good, Trebol?

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:45.409
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:16:51.054 --> 00:16:53.325
[laughs]

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.328
Doflamingo!

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.677
I found you!

00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:43.960
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
Took you long enough, Straw Hat.

00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:46.565
How's dear old Bellamy doing?

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:50.974
Now that he has his freedom.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:54.515
[LUFFY] Don't play dumb!
You set this all up!

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.967
You knew he'd never run away!

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:09.646
Gum-Gum Elephant Gun!

00:18:09.712 --> 00:18:11.682
Spiderweb spread out!

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.293
Interesting.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.933
So I guess Bellamy didn't
high tail it after all.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:22.003
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.307
What's so funny?

00:18:28.048 --> 00:18:29.251
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:36.231
Now, Gum-Gum Hawk Gatling, go!

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.957
[yells]

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:52.764
[panting]

00:18:57.073 --> 00:18:58.275
[gasps]

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:05.155
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:09.565
And now, Break White!

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:17.948
[LUFFY]
Whoa!

00:19:18.015 --> 00:19:20.219
[LUFFY gasps]

00:19:22.824 --> 00:19:24.428
[gasps]

00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:26.532
[LUFFY]
Hey. Traffy!

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.037
Where's all this
blood coming from?

00:19:29.104 --> 00:19:30.473
Where'd your arm go?

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.613
Hey! Traffy! Hang in there!

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:36.652
Hey! Traffy!

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:43.766
[DOFLAMINGO]
What, you can't tell? He's dead.

00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:46.171
Liar!

00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:47.473
Just look at him.

00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:50.146
"Traffy" was holding out
for you to come through.

00:19:50.213 --> 00:19:52.349
What a damn shame.

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:55.657
[DOFLAMINGO]
He did mention that you're

00:19:55.724 --> 00:19:59.732
quite the miracle
worker, Straw Hat.

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:05.242
I dunno, you didn't impress me
much in our first fight.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:08.348
And I doubt you stand a chance
against both of us.

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:11.321
You'll pay for this,
you bastards!

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:13.693
[TREBOL laughs]

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.363
Let's go! Gum-Gum...

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:17.667
Pentachromatic Strings!

00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:20.574
...Battle-Axe!

00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.513
[LUFFY yells]

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:37.106
Now Gum-Gum Giant Whip, go!

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:39.745
Armament Hardening!

00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:47.594
[TREBOL]
What the hell is that?

00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:57.279
And Gum-Gum Spring Bullet!

00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:03.626
[yells]

00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:23.165
Very close! Wow. [laughs]

00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:30.445
[panting]

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.465
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:21:43.238 --> 00:21:45.442
[TANK]
Is something wrong, sir?

00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:47.647
No.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.179
Wait! Hold you positions!

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:04.548
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Huh?

00:22:09.825 --> 00:22:15.269
[grating]

00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.672
What is that?

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:18.208
Huh? I dunno!

00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:19.477
[MARINE A]
Hm?

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:21.782
What's wrong?

00:22:26.993 --> 00:22:29.831
No, it's nothing.

00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:34.708
No way. It moves?

00:22:36.912 --> 00:22:37.848
Oh, no.

00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:39.651
Let's back up.

00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:45.964
[TOWNSMAN L]
It's shrinking!

00:22:50.138 --> 00:22:52.912
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
You'll be joining your pal, Law,

00:22:52.978 --> 00:22:54.715
in no time.

00:22:57.486 --> 00:23:00.627
And now, we end this game.

00:23:00.693 --> 00:23:01.929
Mingo!

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:05.202
-[LAW] Wait.
-[gasps]

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:08.408
[LAW]
Listen carefully, Straw Hat.

00:23:14.187 --> 00:23:17.561
[NARRATOR] Doflamingo's plan to
wipe out Dressrosa is in motion.

00:23:17.627 --> 00:23:19.463
With the Birdcage
shrinking in on itself,

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:20.734
there's only one hour left

00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:23.338
as it slices through
everything it passes.

00:23:23.405 --> 00:23:25.342
Just as it seems
all hope's lost,

00:23:25.409 --> 00:23:26.679
a desperate attack is unleashed

00:23:26.745 --> 00:23:29.651
to stop Doflamingo
before it's too late.

00:23:29.718 --> 00:23:31.622
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:35.463 --> 00:23:38.468
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
