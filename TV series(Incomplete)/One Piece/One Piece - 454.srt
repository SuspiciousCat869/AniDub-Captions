1
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,575
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:41,411
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,146
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,015
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:47,483
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:50,320
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,055
after eating the
Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,225
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,194
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,596
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,197
of the World Government,

12
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:05,668
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:08,071
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,140
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,210
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

16
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:20,250
The crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,254
[NARRATOR] Separated from
the Straw Hat crew,

18
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,489
Luffy has broken
out of Impel Down,

19
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,191
the world's greatest prison,

20
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,526
and is currently headed
to Navy Headquarters

21
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,795
to rescue his brother Ace.

22
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,633
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, after being scattered

23
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,235
across the globe,
the rest of the Straw Hats

24
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,138
are locked in the midst
of their own adventures.

25
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,242
[LUFFY]
"The Friends' Whereabouts!

26
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,646
The Chick of Giant Bird
and a Pink Showdown!"

27
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,185
[LUFFY] I get ya.

28
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,289
So it's gonna be even harder
to break into Navy HQ

29
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,357
than Impel Down.

30
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,526
[JIMBEI] They're anticipating
Whitebeard's assault

31
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:07,463
at any moment, so they're
prepared for all-out war.

32
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,832
And there's no doubt that
they've manned the place

33
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,769
with the most formidable
and infamous figures known

34
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:16,439
to the world today.
None of us here want

35
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:18,641
to get ourselves caught
up in a full-blown war,

36
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,811
but I'm afraid that might
be inevitable now.

37
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,754
[NARRATOR]
A short time before any of this,

38
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,756
positioned deep
in the Grand Line,

39
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,528
we find Peachy Island, home
of the Kamabakka Kingdom.

40
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,867
[SANJI panting]

41
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:56,512
[SANJI] Dammit. I run and I
run, but they never give up!

42
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,183
[ELIZABETH] What's wrong,
pumpkin? Aren't you one of us?

43
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,485
[QUEENS]
Wait!

44
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,555
[ELIZABETH]
Wait!

45
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,126
[SANJI]
Crap! Quit chasing me!

46
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,198
[QUEENS laugh]

47
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,301
[SANJI]
What?!

48
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,907
[SANJI] This is messed up!
They're freakin' strong as hell!

49
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,276
They may be wearing dresses,

50
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,313
but there's nothin' sissy
about these punks!

51
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,824
Oh, Nami and Robin!

52
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:46,295
How I long to see your
beauty once more!

53
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,314
[CAROLINE]
Is that so?

54
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,717
There have been some
candy boys in the past

55
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,820
who have had trouble accepting
themselves after washing ashore

56
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,689
on the banks of our
paradise. No matter.

57
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,359
We simply need to extend
an elegant helpin' hand

58
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:20,263
to the lost soul. I suppose
I should ask if he's strong.

59
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,365
He won't win any
bodybuilding contests,

60
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,300
but his kicks aren't
a total mess.

61
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,602
[CAROLINE] Well, it's been
ages since we've done so,

62
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,572
but I think the traditional
method of the Kamabakka Kingdom

63
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:33,976
would be best employed
here. [laughs]

64
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,950
[SANJI] Don't you have anything
better to do? Go away!

65
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,521
Quit chasing me! Why won't
you leave me alone?

66
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:47,824
[QUEENS]
You'll see!

67
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:50,993
[SANJI]
Like hell, I will!

68
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:52,995
[SANJI panting]

69
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:06,008
[SANJI pants]
Where am I?

70
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,743
I wasn't even looking.

71
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,946
Am I safe in here?

72
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,715
What the hell is wrong
with you psychos?!

73
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:13,783
[laughs]

74
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,885
[SANJI screams]

75
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,865
[groaning] Ow.

76
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,766
[CAROLINE]
I've been waitin' for you.

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,968
[SANJI]
Uh...

78
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,480
Hey, hold on. Who is
this bastard?

79
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,649
You do not disrespect
her like that.

80
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:49,318
Her name is Lady Caroline.

81
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,489
[SANJI]
You the queen here or something?

82
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:57,560
Me? The queen? Oh, please!

83
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,595
[QUEENS laugh]

84
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,870
[CAROLINE] To be exact, I'm
the queen substitute! Caroline!

85
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,575
[QUEENS]
Oh!

86
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,544
Caroline!

87
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,915
[SANJI]
Uh. You're just a stand-in?

88
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:22,351
Kamabakka Kingdom is
ruled by one alone,

89
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,820
the legendary Queen Ivankov!

90
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:26,822
It'd be presumptuous
to call myself queen

91
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,057
just because she's away.

92
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,927
I couldn't give two turds if
you're the actual queen or not.

93
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,797
You've clearly got their ear, so
get it straight! I'm done here!

94
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,534
This is hell! Now get
me off of this rock!

95
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,904
[laughs] Very well. I hear you.

96
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,139
Huh?

97
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,508
[CAROLINE] However. If you're
so desperate to leave, first

98
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,078
you must fight the strongest
of our kingdom and win.

99
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:49,779
Deal?

100
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,514
You're damn right it's a deal!

101
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,982
Anything to escape
this nightmare!

102
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,016
[QUEENS]
Ooh....

103
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,052
[ELIZABETH chuckles]

104
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,853
Okay!

105
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,555
Let's get you changed
into one of our

106
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,725
traditional Kamabakka combat
outfits before the match.

107
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:07,004
What? A costume? Seriously?

108
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:15,096
[QUEENS laughing]

109
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,012
[SANJI]
Your "combat outfit," huh?

110
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:33,681
And I fell for it, too!

111
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,950
[ALL]
Aw, you look cute!

112
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,785
Shut up! I do not!

113
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,922
I've had just about as much
as I can take of this crap.

114
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,392
Just fight me. I'll finish
you off with a single blow.

115
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:48,663
Once I do, I can forget all
about this idiotic island.

116
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:55,336
[ALL]
Ah! Gorgeous!

117
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:59,840
Really? You're the
strongest one on the island?

118
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:01,108
[CAROLINE] Well, how
do you think I became

119
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,145
the substitute queen
of Kamabakka Kingdom?

120
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,847
My prowess in the
Kamabakka style!

121
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:12,019
I am the New Kama Kenpo
Grandmaster... substitute.

122
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,088
Would you stop doing that?!

123
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,430
Come on. Let's just
get this over with!

124
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:25,399
[CAROLINE]
Gladly! I'll show you my moves!

125
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:28,336
Yeah, I don't plan on givin'
you the chance to get that far.

126
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:33,774
I hate to burst your bubble, but
you're goin' down with one kick!

127
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,380
And Concassé!

128
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,786
Now let the dust settle.

129
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,722
Wha...? Where is he?!

130
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,458
[CAROLINE]
Right behind you, candy boy!

131
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:56,397
[SANJI groaning]

132
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,836
Oh!

133
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,904
[SANJI grunts]
Fine!

134
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:11,412
[SANJI] What the hell? Why
can't I land a single attack?

135
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,815
And his eyes. Why does
he keep looking down?

136
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,485
And what's up with these
weird ducking moves?

137
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:21,188
Ah... aw, don't tell me
he's looking at...

138
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,324
[CAROLINE]
Oh! Nice up-skirt, honey!

139
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:26,027
[SANJI]
Ah! Hey, don't look, you perv!

140
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,237
[SANJI panting] Not that
I care! I mean, I'm a dude!

141
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,439
Why would I be embarrassed if
you see my stupid underwear?

142
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,540
'Cause I'm not!

143
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,343
Sounds like your maiden-like
modesty is comin' out!

144
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:44,245
[SANJI] That's the stupidest
crap I've ever heard!

145
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:46,113
You're not getting
under my skin!

146
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:48,983
What the hell do I care
if you see my underwear!

147
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,053
[CAROLINE]
Are you sure about that?

148
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,155
You're certainly not
kicking quite as high.

149
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:58,492
Seems like proof that you
really are embarrassed. See?

150
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:01,095
Hey, don't measure
my deadly kicks!

151
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:04,098
I'm only trying to show you that
you have doubt in your heart.

152
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,834
Shut up! You don't know
what you're talking about!

153
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:10,137
Oh, don't I?

154
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,373
Whoa, n-n-n-n-no, stop that!

155
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,510
As I thought. You're
wearin' your masculinity

156
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,146
as a shield, hiding
your true feelings.

157
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,381
[SANJI]
What?

158
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:24,852
[CAROLINE] There's no greater
freedom than being yourself.

159
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:28,456
[CAROLINE] So? Are you
done with your kicking?

160
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:31,425
I take it that you're inviting
me to attack you now?

161
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,163
New Kama Kenpo Technique!
Awakening Inner Maiden!

162
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:37,865
[SANJI]
Uh!

163
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,943
[SANJI]
Why? It's just stupid underwear!

164
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,880
Right? So why am I paralyzed
with embarrassment?

165
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,915
[SANJI]
Whoa! Stop!

166
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:59,019
[SANJI] What? Did I really
just scream like a girl?

167
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,988
What's happening?

168
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:04,492
Why do I... Why do
I feel this way?

169
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:07,361
I'm so confused right now.

170
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:09,897
Am I...?

171
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,365
I am.

172
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:16,437
I feel like I'm losing
myself. I'm letting go.

173
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,940
And I'm... becoming
somebody else!

174
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:34,088
[SANJI] "Dear Nami and
Robin. How are you?

175
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,223
I hope this finds you well.

176
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:40,127
I do so look forward to seeing
the two of you again.

177
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:42,396
I'm certain when
that time comes,

178
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:46,367
we'll be better friends
than ever before!"

179
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,321
[NARRATOR] Deep in the South
Blue lies Birdie Kingdom,

180
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:11,091
where a race of giant
birds reign supreme.

181
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:29,677
[sighs] Oh, man, I really
want off this stinking island.

182
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,513
This place is
seriously the worst.

183
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,451
[CHOPPER] Birds treating
me like I'm their toy.

184
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:41,388
And humans constantly trying
to eat me in a hot pot.

185
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:48,128
[CHOPPER] If that's not
bad enough, and it really is,

186
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:52,132
the birds and the humans won't
stop fighting each other.

187
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:58,505
There's gotta be
a way out of here.

188
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,275
[chirps]

189
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,014
Calm down. I gathered
up a nice dinner for you.

190
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,950
[BIRDIE chirps]

191
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,089
[CHOPPER]
How are your legs feeling today?

192
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,458
Did they get any
better overnight?

193
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:21,962
Here, let me take a look.
Quit movin' around, now.

194
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:26,133
[CHOPPER]
Hey. They're all healed up!

195
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,470
All right. Better eat these
to get your strength back.

196
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:31,672
[BIRDIE chirps]

197
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:35,376
You're sure lucky I was
around. Just imagine.

198
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:39,013
What if I'd been out searching
for herbs or something?

199
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,025
[CHOPPER] This should fix
an upset stomach right up.

200
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:57,464
[CHOPPER gasps] Ah! What in
the heck was that noise?

201
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,466
Are the humans after me again?

202
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,069
Please! Please don't let them
throw me in a hot pot!

203
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:04,405
They're gonna eat me!

204
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:14,348
That's a big cheeper. [gasps]

205
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:23,057
[CHOPPER] I guess she must've
fallen out of the nest.

206
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,392
[BIRDIE cries]

207
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:27,728
[CHOPPER] She's way too young
to communicate with me,

208
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:31,498
although I can tell she's
hurt. That much is obvious.

209
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,269
[gasps] Wow,
that's really bad.

210
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,806
Not that I'm all that surprised,
just look how far she fell.

211
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,541
Hey, try not to move!

212
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,177
C'mon, stop, you're only
gonna make it worse!

213
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,247
Hey! Calm down
and do what I say!

214
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,716
Trust me, I'm a doctor!

215
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:51,251
[BIRDIE coos]

216
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:57,157
[BIRDIE chirps]

217
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:59,293
[CHOPPER]
Ah, jeez, you sure do eat a lot.

218
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:00,494
You're gonna wear me out

219
00:17:00,527 --> 00:17:04,064
if I have to keep collecting
this fruit for you all day!

220
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,667
But she needs all
the food she can get

221
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,570
so she can grow up strong
and be able to fly someday.

222
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:13,340
And then she can return
to the nest. Oh, yeah!

223
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,515
You gotta do me a favor
when you learn to fly.

224
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,317
You can get me off
this crazy island

225
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,487
and take me to the
Sabaody Archipelago!

226
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:33,260
Luffy! Here I come!

227
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,831
[laughs] Awesome, huh?

228
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:39,500
I mean, it's almost
like I planned it

229
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,667
when I helped you out!

230
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:43,670
You gotta promise me, okay?
And don't forget about it!

231
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:44,471
[chirps]

232
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,541
[CHOPPER laughs]
Hey! Knock it off!

233
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,743
That tickles, you
little monster! Stop!

234
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,912
[laughs, groans]

235
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,715
Oh, c'mon! You, too?

236
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:59,286
Do I really look that much
like a damn bird toy?

237
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,402
[sighs] So warm.

238
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,986
It's great to see
you guys again.

239
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,524
Not that I actually missed
your ugly jerk faces.

240
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,969
[CHOPPER] Uh. Hang on.
I wonder where she went?

241
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,372
Oh well. Her legs are
all healed up by now.

242
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,443
She must've gone
out for a walk.

243
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,078
Whoa, what?!

244
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,554
[CHOPPER] This is really bad.
I better find her fast.

245
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,423
Judging by these prints,
she can't be far.

246
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,025
[TRIBESMAN A]
I starving, you guys.

247
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,226
[SHANBA]
We know.

248
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,329
We all starving, tha why we
try to find escaped raccoon,

249
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,899
you dummy, why you
think we here?

250
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,601
That was reindeer,
you the dummy!

251
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,270
--Shut up.
--Who cares what is?

252
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,338
We going to catch and
make some hot pot!

253
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,406
[TRIBESMAN A]
Now you talking!

254
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,241
[SHANBA]
Me salivating!

255
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,846
Oh, no. Not good.
Not good at all!

259
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:02,234
[CHOPPER] Hey, I found you!
I'm so glad you're okay!

260
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,869
[TRIBESMAN A]
I don't think it here, guys.

261
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,904
[CHOPPER gasps]
Shhh!

262
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,907
So we check out another
part of jungle, right?

263
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,576
Yeah, you right.

264
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,178
Good, they didn't see us.

265
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,380
So, you went wandering
and got lost, huh?

266
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,916
--[BIRDIE chirps]
--[CHOPPER laughs]

267
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,618
I guess it's safe to
say you're better now,

268
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,588
but you gotta be quiet, okay?

269
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,023
Those guys'll find us if
we make too much noise.

270
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,024
[chirps]

271
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,328
--[chirps]
--Uh! No! Shut up!

272
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,329
[TRIBESMEN]
Huh?!

273
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,297
[CHOPPER]
Aw, dammit!

274
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,967
Right there! I see reindeer!

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,568
I see bird, too!

276
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,570
[panting]

277
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,109
[TRIBESMAN A] Double hot
pot for dinner tonight!

278
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,346
Chicken hot pot and
reindeer hot pot!

279
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,593
You're kidding me!
They've got us cornered!

--Uh...
--[chirps]

281
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,199
Nowhere left to go.

282
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,468
[TRIBESMAN B]
Give up, dinner.

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,509
Big birds comin' to
save the cheeper!

287
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,645
We shoo them away!

288
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,285
Awesome! Are you guys
really coming to help us?

289
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,022
[CHOPPER] Your baby got
hurt but don't worry,

290
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,690
I've been takin' care
of her for you,

291
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:35,961
but you don't need to thank me
or anything, you big bastard.

292
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,598
[CHOPPER]
Huh?

[CHOPPER groans]

294
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:47,339
[CHOPPER] I totally knew you
were gonna do that!

295

[TRIBESMEN scream]

297
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,664
And they're right back
to fighting again.

298
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,199
Of course.

[gasps]

300
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,603
I guess she must be the mother.

301
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:23,675
Take care! And don't
forget the promise you made!

302
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,278
As soon as you get big
enough and know how to fly,

303
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,779
you gotta take me
to see my friends

304
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,315

Uh! But, how long
is that gonna take?

to death of this stupid place!

What is wrong with the humans
and the birds on this island?!

Can't they just
try to get along?!

[NARRATOR] Robin is captured in
a place known as Tequila Wolf.

A young girl named Soran,
whom she befriended,

318
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,272
seeks to help her, but
she can't do it alone.

319

Meanwhile, Usopp trains to
become a hero of the forest

to be a distraction.
