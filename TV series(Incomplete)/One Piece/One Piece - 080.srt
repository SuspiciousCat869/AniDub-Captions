So sorry about that.

175
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,489
[OWNER]
It's... you.

176
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,491
So, are you kids... happy?

177
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,627
[KUREHA cackles]

178
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,662
[ALL yell]

179
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,996
[ALL]
Doctor Kureha!

180
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,832
[KUREHA] Anyone want my
secret to staying young?

181
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,667
[ALL]
No, were fine, thank you!

182
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,903
I can't believe she's really a
hundred and forty years old!

183
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,473
I'll have you know
I'm only 139.

184
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,375
[TAMACHIBI cries]

185
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,543
Shall I treat the boy?

186
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,712
Wait... what...? He's fine!

187
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,816
He isn't sick or hurt
or anything, really!

188
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,521
[KUREHA] Oh, well then.
Excuse me... doctor.

189
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,089
[gasp]

190
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,059
[KUREHA]
Let's go, Chopper.

191
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:18,097
Wait... Please come back!

192
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,733
I'm sorry. This is my mistake.

193
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,934
[USOPP, VIVI gasp]

194
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,769
[DALTON] I was aware that the
doctor had come into town

195
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,705
from the mountain
in the last few days.

196
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,573
But I assumed that she had
left and wouldn't be back

197
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,708
for quite some time.

198
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,077
[USOPP] Don't worry about it.
This isn't your fault.

199
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,179
The problem here is
how abnormally strong

200
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,714
Luffy and Sanji are.

201
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,549
Even if we go up the
mountain after them,

202
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,018
there's no way we'd be able
to catch up to them.

203
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,754
If we are able to find the
witch in this Cocoaweed place,

204
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,756
we just need to tell her
to get back up the mountain

205
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,792
as quickly as
she possibly can.

206
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,030
You're right... That's true.
We have no other choice.

207
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,064
[DALTON]
Forgive us.

208
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,232
[VIVI, USOPP]
Huh?

209
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,468
[DALTON] Forgive this land
for not having more doctors.

210
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,737
Don't say that. This isn't
something that you

211
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,639
need to be
apologizing for, Dalton.

212
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,440
[USOPP]
She's right about that.

213
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,809
[DALTON]
Let's hurry.

214
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,323
[TAMACHIBI groans]

215
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,060
[TAMACHIBI]
It's my hands... they hurt.

216
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,298
Your hands? All right...
how's this?

217
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,599
Ow, my leg!

218
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,102
You see? Now you've forgotten
all about your hands hurting.

219
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,138
What was that about?
What did you do to him?!

220
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,272
[KUREHA]
Are you happy?

221
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,174
You're happy. Good.

222
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,275
Now, stay nice and quiet.

223
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,276
Hey!

224
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,111
And you should calm down.

225
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,114
I only touched his leg,
and I did it very lightly.

226
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,283
[OWNER]
I heard a terrible noise!

227
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,652
He has pain in his
hands and legs.

228
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,454
He doesn't have a fever.

229
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:52,091
The swelling here on his leg is
from a purulent inflammation.

230
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,960
And it doesn't look good.

231
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,329
By now, the bone is
surely infected.

232
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,032
Chopper, bring me
some antibiotics.

233
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,368
Um, doctor? Is he all right?

234
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,636
The key to curing this disease

235
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,038
is treating it before
it can get too strong.

236
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,707
Don't worry. He'll live.

237
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,709
However he did almost die.

238
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,978
[OWNER]
What?! Almost died?!

239
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,146
[KUREHA] We're going to
do a little operation, okay?

240
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,149
[OWNER] Wait! Aren't you
going to use any anesthesia?

241
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,118
[KUREHA]
This is the anesthesia.

242
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,053
What the hell?!

243
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,390
[KUREHA]
Now, see how easy that was?

244
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,691
That's it for the treatment,

245
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,727
or the part you need
me for, anyway.

246
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,495
The rest is up to you.

247
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,000
Just make sure he rests and keep
his legs tightly bandaged.

248
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,235
Once they're bandaged,
keep them iced down.

249
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,536
Do you understand?

250
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,204
[OWNER]
Yes...

251
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,705
[KUREHA]
Now, about my fee.

252
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,241
I'm all out of trash
bags and toilet paper,

253
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,210
so I'm taking all of
those that you have,

254
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,679
along with all your
food and plum wine.

255
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,682
In addition to that, I'll be
taking 50 percent of this

256
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,150
restaurant's assets.

257
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:51,851
[gasps]

258
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,687
Chopper? Take it
all to the sled.

259
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,155
[OWNER]
This is outrageous!

260
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,690
You can't take half my assets!

261
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,259
Don't even think about giving
her all that; it's too much!

262
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,427
It's just crazy!

263
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,498
[CUSTOMERS shouting]

264
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,234
[CUSTOMER B] How dare you take
advantage of a sick person?!

265
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,536
[CUSTOMER E]
You should be ashamed!

266
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,373
[ALL] You aren't a real doctor
at all! You're just a witch!

267
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,111
[CHOPPER growls]

268
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,546
It's all right, Chopper.

269
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,215
They're just a bunch of
blabbering children.

270
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,284
[TAMACHIBI]
Old lady.

271
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,252
[OWNER gasps]

272
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,689
The pain... it's all better now.

273
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,723
Thanks so much!

274
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,392
[gasps]

275
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,730
Well, it looks like your son
just gave me a nice tip.

276
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,233
So I'll reduce my
fee to 49 percent.

277
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:47,740
[OWNER gasps] I'll pay
your price. Thank you.

278
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,709
[KUREHA]
Oh yeah... Hey, kid.

279
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,776
Huh?

280
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,547
This happiness you feel.
Don't you ever forget it.

281
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:01,253
‐‐[KUREHA cackles]
‐‐[TAMACHIBI] Okay!

282
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:20,473
[ZORO]
Burr...

283
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,408
[ZORO]
It's freezing out here!

284
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,443
My whole body is
beginning to go numb.

285
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,346
I feel more like a popsicle
than a human at the moment.

286
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,348
Looks like I have a
lot more training to do.

287
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,617
But if I really concentrate,
I shouldn't be bothered by

288
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,619
even the coldest temperatures.

289
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,623
[ZORO] Hey, Karoo!
Want to come in with me?

290
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,825
It's a great way to get your
little bird body in shape!

291
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:44,363
[KAROO grumbles]

292
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,435
[KAROO shouts, whimpers]

293
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,773
[KAROO shouts]

294
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,511
[gasps] I didn't expect to
see this many fish here.

295
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,212
Well, I've got more to do.

296
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,282
[LUFFY grunts]

297
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,483
They coming?

298
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,452
[SANJI]
No. It doesn't look like it.

299
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,555
All right. I guess
we lost 'em, huh?

300
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,158
[SANJI]
Nope. We haven't yet.

301
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,793
[LUFFY]
They don't give up!

302
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,335
Why are they
jumpin' up and down?

303
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,644
[SANJI grunts]

304
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,512
[LUFFY] Maybe they're
grouchy cause they're hungry.

305
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,181
[SANJI]
I don't think so.

306
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,183
W‐Wait a second...

307
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,353
Don't tell me... Oh, no...

308
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,700
Dalton. You haven't
told us who you are yet.

309
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,370
Doesn't really seem like you're
just an ordinary villager.

310
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,406
You have this certain way of
speaking that makes me think

311
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,541
of a military officer.

312
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:08,347
[DALTON] You're correct.
I did serve this country.

313
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,216
Under our former tyrant, Wapol.

314
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,851
[BOTH gasp]

315
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:17,289
[WAPOL laughs]

316
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,558
[DALTON] I became the captain of
this country's security guard

317
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,896
long ago, during the time
that Wapol's father ruled here.

318
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,399
However, the time came
when the king died

319
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,603
and his rule was then handed
down to his son, Wapol.

320
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,972
When that happened,
this country changed.

321
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,308
[WAPOL] I have come up with
yet another brilliant new law!

322
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,745
I've decided that I'm going to
exile the country's doctors!

323
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,312
[CHESS]
What?

324
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:40,946
[KUROMARIMO]
Exile?

325
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,114
[DALTON]
The doctors?!

326
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,584
[WAPOL] Yes! I'll keep the
20 best doctors in the land,

327
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,786
and they will be my
private physicians.

328
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,722
I'll call them the Twenty MDs.

329
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,390
[CHESS]
The Twenty MDs?

330
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,625
[WAPOL]
That's right.

331
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,728
The Twenty MDs will be just for
me, and the rest will be exiled!

332
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,430
[KUROMARIMO] What a great idea,
Wapol! You're so smart.

333
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,965
[DALTON]
No! If you do this,

334
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,568
then who will the people go to
when they're sick or injured?

335
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,336
[WAPOL] Why should I
care about what happens

336
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,005
to those useless people?

337
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,909
If anyone needs a doctor, they
will have to grovel before me.

338
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,779
Anyone who disobeys me will be
refused any treatment at all.

339
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,483
This way, no one in the entire
country will dare defy me!

340
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,587
[WAPOL laughs] I'm such a
genius sometimes, it kills me!

341
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,623
[laughing continues]

342
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,025
[DALTON growls]

343
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,259
Wow, So from then on,

344
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,029
anyone who got sick had no
choice but to throw themselves

345
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,632
on Wapol's mercy and hope that
the Twenty MDs would treat them.

346
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,669
Yes and pay the excessive
medical fees.

347
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,305
So basically, Wapol was
ruling the country by taking

348
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,474
the citizens' lives
and health hostage?!

349
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,778
That's not ruling! What sort
of king would do that?!

350
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,446
That's tyranny.

351
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,483
[VIVI whimpers]

352
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,985
[DALTON]
It's just as I thought.

353
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,454
There can be no
mistaking it now.

00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,538
[ZORO]
Burr...

355
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,474
Damn it! I got carried away
and swam for too long!

356
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,710
Where am I now?
And where's the ship?

357
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,713
This is great. I have no
way of telling where I am

358
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,548
with all this
snow everywhere.

359
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,849
[ZORO]
Huh?

360
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,920
[ZORO]
Tsk.

361
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,524
[ZORO gasps]
I'm saved! Hey, old lady!

362
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,693
Sorry to bother you, but do you
think you could drop me off

363
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,695
at a village nearby
or something?

364
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,598
[ZORO]
Whoa!

365
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,667
What are you doing dressed
like that in this weather?

366
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,537
I've seen some weird old ladies
in my day but, but you, your‐‐

367
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,872
Huh? Uh...

368
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,675
Careful how you talk
to me, little boy.

369
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,377
[ZORO shouts]

370
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,012
At a hundred and
thirty‐nine years old,

371
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,213
I'm still young and strong.

372
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,850
Let's go, Chopper. That boy
is clearly some kind of freak.

373
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,085
[ZORO]
Come back here!

374
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,455
The hell was her problem?
Dumb old hag!

375
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,058
[whimpers]
That's cold!

376
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,394
I'll freeze to
death before long.

377
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,763
All right. I guess for now
I'll do some strength training

378
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,732
to get myself warmed up a bit.

379
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,402
[WAPOL laughs]

380
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,404
[WAPOL]
We've arrived at last!

381
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,740
After all this time,
I've returned to Drum Kingdom.

382
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,642
I'm finally home!

383
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,712
[WAPOL laughs]

384
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,983
[CHESS] Huh! Were they trying to
pretend to be a real military?

385
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,718
[KUROMARIMO] Bunch of
idiots and amateurs.

386
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,887
What were they thinking,
shooting at us like that?

387
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,424
[WAPOL]
Hm... Oh, my dear Drum Island.

388
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,126
Your towering majesty has
grown even more beautiful

389
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,928
in my absence!

390
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,930
Chess, is the castle all right?

391
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,735
Yes. It looks just as good as
when we left it. It's perfect.

392
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:54,139
[WAPOL laughs] What are we
waitin' for? Lets go home, boys.

393
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:59,011
I'm done being a pirate. Ha!
I'm going to be king again!

394
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,779
Onward, Robson!

395
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,616
[laughs]

396
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:09,822
[WAPOL] Huh? Robson move!
Why are you just standing here?

397
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,091
Hey! Get moving already!

398
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,460
[SUBORDINATE]
Wapol! We have a problem!

399
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,961
[WAPOL]
Hm. What's the matter now?

400
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,097
[SUBORDINATE]
The pirates...

401
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,766
The ones from the other day!
Their ship's over there!

402
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,000
[WAPOL]
What?!

403
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:26,805
Not them! What are the Straw Hat
Pirates doing in my country?!

404
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,773
How dare they come here

405
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,809
after pretending to not
even know about it!

406
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,547
[LUFFY]
Leave!

407
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,651
Does he not even care?!
I had a very painful recovery!

408
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,554
You! Go kill those
pirates now. I demand it!

409
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,023
[SUBORDINATE] Um, actually,
the ship is empty, sir.

410
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,024
Empty?

411
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,625
[SUBORDINATE]
We don't know where they went.

412
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,161
You want to be executed?

413
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,697
Our apologies, Wapol.
Please forgive him.

414
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,799
This man is just a
useless subordinate.

415
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,633
[WAPOL]
Hm.

416
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,169
Chess... Kuromarimo?

417
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,171
We took the liberty of
inspecting the footprints

418
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,007
that led away from the ship,
and we have some information.

419
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,208
Indeed.

420
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,811
It looks as if the footprints
were headed toward Big Horn.

421
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:10,015
Very good. That was
absolutely brilliant.

422
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,585
In that case, we're
headed on to Big Horn.

423
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,155
We'll stop there to fire a
salute to the restoration

424
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,556

Wait. What are you telling us?

427
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,201
You mean the witch left this
town just a few moments ago?!

428
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,904
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

429
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,272
This is ridiculous!

430
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,276
She left after she made
my sickness all better.

431
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,577
[DALTON grunts]

432
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,580
[OWNER] If you're looking for
the doctor, she's already left.

433
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,215
We have to find her.

434
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,250
Can you tell us where she was
headed when she left here?

435
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,052
[CUSTOMER D]
I think I know.

436
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,255
I heard from somebody else that
she was headed for Gyasta.

437
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,256
Gyasta?

438
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,224
So where is that?

439
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,226
If we were going to
Gyasta from Big Horn,

440
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,427
we'd go in the
opposite direction

441
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,395
than we went to come here.

442
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,463
Oh great! We already passed her?

443
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,232
Ice skating is very
popular there.

444
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,201
[USOPP] What does that have
to do with anything?

445
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,469
‐‐Who cares about that?
‐‐[VIVI] Calm down, Usopp.

446
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,371
We need to get
going to that town.

447
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,974
At this point, we really don't
have any time to lose.

448
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,310

Yeah, you're right.

[GUARD grunting]
I found you at last!

451
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,050
Yes, guard. But I thought you
were standing watch today.

452

[GUARD groans]

453
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,588
What's the matter? I can tell
that you've been badly injured.

454
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,389
Tell me what went wrong.

455
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:28,427
Every watchman except for me.
They've all been killed, Dalton.

456
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,328
What?!

457
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,597
This thing...
This submarine sailboat...

458
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,967
it came out of nowhere,
and it attacked us.

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,468
They killed every one
of the watchmen.

460
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:37,970
We couldn't stop them.

461
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,471
Who are "they"?
I don't understand.

462
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,106
Please explain this.

463
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,976
Please Dalton!
You have to help us!

We aren't strong
enough to fight them!

465
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,280
You have to do something!

466
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,648
What's wrong?

467
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,251
It was them?

468
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,655
It was Wapol! Wapol and
his men. They came back!

469
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,623
[CUSTOMER A]
What did he say?!

470
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,657
[CUSTOMER B]
Wapol's back?!

471
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,758
[CUSTOMER C]
That can't be true!

472
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,326
[CUSTOMER D]
Why's he here?

473
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,129
Hey wait!

474
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,631
Dalton, wait!

475
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:14,172
[DALTON] I'm going to settle
this once and for all.

476
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,443
In the end, I don't know if it
can really be called justice.

477
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,679
I may be just as
guilty as you are,

478
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,315
but you're the one
who will be punished.

479
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:31,123
[DALTON] Just wait!
I'm coming for you, Wapol!

They've done it now!

This isn't good.

Uh... Wait, what are
you talking about?

00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,376

00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,837
[LUFFY shouts] The bunnies
are still following us!

512
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,472
[VIVI]
I wonder if Dalton is all right.

513
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,142
Can he take on Wapol and
his men all by himself?

514
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,644
[ZORO] Whoa! Look at that sword!
He's really good!

515
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,413
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

516
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:38,150
"Dalton's Resolve! Wapol's
Corps Lands on the Island!"

517
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,652
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
