1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,727
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,398
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:50,436
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,340
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,710
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,180
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,583
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,553
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,455
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,559
[BROOK]
Yohohoho!

48
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,360
It's such a
pleasure to meet you!

49
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,562
Hello and good day to you all!

50
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,596
Are you kidding me?

51
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,730
What the heck is this thing?

52
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,532
Yohohohoho!

53
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,701
Oh my, what a
tough crowd you are!

54
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,736
[chuckles]

55
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,206
My goodness, and what
a lovely young woman--

56
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,774
perhaps you would like
to show me your panties?

57
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,243
That's enough
sexual harassment!

58
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,445
What is this thing and
why is it on our ship?

59
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,746
That's our new
crew member!

60
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,614
Isn't he funny?

61
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,383
Who cares?
He's not joining our crew!

62
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,886
[BROOK] Now, now,
let's be civil, everyone.

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,789
Why don't we go inside?
You can treat me to dinner!

64
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,757
You don't get to decide that!

65
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,659
Hahahaha!

66
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,461
I love this guy!

67
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,897
[NAMI] The Revive-Revive Fruit?

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,732
The Revive-Revive Fruit...

69
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,467
[slurping]

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,404
...allows a person to be
reanimated after they have died.

71
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,240
[slurping]

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,741
Even among devil fruit powers,

73
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,477
the ability to live two lives
is indeed quite strange.

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,145
So you're a "revive man!"

75
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,448
Look at his feet!

76
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,283
He doesn't even have a shadow!

77
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,818
[CHOPPER] Aaaaah!
You're right!

78
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,320
What kind of creature are you?

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,759
I suppose that I should
tell you the rest of the story.

80
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,629
About what happened while
I was drifting in this evil sea,

81
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,164
and the second tragedy
I was forced to face.

82
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,799
Aaaaahh!!

83
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,870
Hey, what's wrong?
You're freaking out!

84
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,507
A g-g-ghost!

85
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:40,513
[CHOPPER] Ah! He's right!
Get out! Go away!

86
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,282
[LUFFY] This is too cool!

87
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,616
[ZORO] It's leaving.

88
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,653
[rumbling]

89
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,821
Wha-- Something's
happening to the ship!

90
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,624
[BROOK] No, it can't be.

91
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,869
What in the world is that?

92
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,707
[LUFFY] Where the heck did
that creepy island come from?

93
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,528
[BROOK] This is the ghost island

94
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,596
that wanders
throughout these seas.

95
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,832
They call it "Thriller Bark."

96
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,841
Thriller Bark. I see.

97
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,015
[LUFFY] "One Unnatural
Phenomenon After the Next!

98
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,017
Disembarking on Thriller Bark"

99
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:52,952
Hey, this is strange.

100
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,888
The Log Pose isn't reacting
to this island at all.

101
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,290
Nor should it.

102
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,359
Because originally,
this island came

103
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,927
all the way in from
the The West Blue.

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,562
[NAMI]
The West Blue?

105
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,896
Indeed.

106
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,767
[SANJI] Hey, where're you going?

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,570
[BROOK] Truly, this has
been a fortunate day for me.

108
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,638
Not only was I able to meet you,

109
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,608
but now my wish has
been granted as well.

110
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,647
Yohohoho!
Yohohohooo!

111
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,549
[SANJI] That's a hell of a jump!

112
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:24,917
Yes!

113
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,720
There's no pesky
flesh weighing me down!

114
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,389
Please do not follow me.

115
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,757
You must break through that gate

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,892
behind you and
escape this place.

117
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,928
Whatever you do, you cannot
drop your anchor in here.

118
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,996
That being said,

119
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,832
it truly was a pleasure
meeting all of you today.

120
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,803
I won't forget your
kindness so long as I live!

121
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,737
Farewell.

122
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,340
I hope we meet again
on the high seas!

123
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,674
[LUFFY] Hey Brook, wait!

124
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,942
Isn't he a Devil Fruit User?

125
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,078
Then he's gonna
sink like a rock!

126
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,981
[BROOK]
Yohohohoho!

127
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,849
[USOPP] He's running
on the water!

128
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
[LUFFY] That is too cool!

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,324
Uh... Anyway, Luffy.

130
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,360
We should listen to
him and get moving.

131
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,462
I don't really understand
the situation here,

132
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,798
but I do know this
island is bad news.

133
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,966
Huh? You guys
say something?

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,835
He totally wants to go!

135
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,503
I've had enough
ghosts for today.

136
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,338
I don't need a
whole island of them!

137
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,306
Wait a sec.

138
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,775
What about that ghost
we saw before, huh?

139
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,110
Is it still here on the boat?

140
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,113
No. Looked like it was
flying to the island.

141
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,981
I'm guessing that's where
the thing came from.

142
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,049
[ROBIN] Interesting.

143
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,819
Like Brook said, the loud
noise we heard earlier

144
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,621
was from that gate
over there closing shut.

145
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,457
So it's not that we ran into it,

146
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,126
but that we were
"eaten" by the mouth.

147
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,031
It ate us?

148
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,066
[ROBIN] The fog
makes it difficult to tell,

149
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,035
but I imagine that the
walls we see here extend

150
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,971
all the way around
the island in a circle.

151
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,640
[ROBIN] That means that we
were intentionally pulled in

152
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,577
and now that the gate is
closed, we're trapped inside.

153
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,578
I see!

154
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,580
That's why the skeleton
told us to run away--

155
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,683
it's because we're stuck
inside some kinda trap!

156
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,518
Wait, then that would
mean the people here

157
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,688
are capturing sailors on
purpose, right? But why?

158
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,922
If this is a moving island,

159
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,158
that means we're still
technically out at sea.

160
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,693
Guess we won't be able
to anchor down here.

161
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,896
Hold on! That's the
last thing we want to do!

162
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,931
We gotta get outta
this place right now!

163
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,999
Bad news, you guys.

164
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,069
I think I have "I Can't
Go on that Island" Sickness.

165
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,605
Me too! I'm real sick!

166
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,940
No problem!
You two watch the ship!

167
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,010
And you've got "Stupid
Adventure Sickness," again !

168
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,046
Come to your senses!
C'mon! Look at that!

169
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,181
That creepy looking building

170
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,618
is a bona fide haunted
mansion if I've ever seen one!

171
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,621
And I'm not talking
about the fun kind, either.

172
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,056
The kind where you
never make it out alive!

173
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,458
[LUFFY] You worry too much!

174
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,626
I'm not going there
to pick a fight--

175
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,760
I promise I'll be careful!

176
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,696
I just wanna catch that
ghost and keep it as a pet.

177
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,964
You're gonna
get us all killed!

178
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,966
Either way, Brook's a
part of our crew now,

179
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,434
so I have to bring him back!

180
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,036
Sanji! Gimme pirate lunchbox!

181
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,437
He's a part of our crew?

182
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,939
Hey, I did not vote for that!

183
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,874
If we have a living skeleton
wandering around this ship,

184
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,143
I won't be able
to sleep at night!

185
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,145
[ROBIN] Here.
I've got the lunchboxes.

186
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,313
Luffy. Franky.

187
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,449
It's up to you to take care of
Robin while I watch the boat.

188
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,751
Nothing gets
my cola pumping

189
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,086
like an adventure on
a crazy new island!

190
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,488
Robin, you aren't
seriously going

191
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,222
with them, are you?

192
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,758
It does sound exciting.

193
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,993
Right. Now listen up!

194
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,828
Obviously, we're gonna
use a smaller boat

195
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,764
to pull us close to the shore.

196
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,731
And the Soldier Dock System

197
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,467
has something pretty
damned super for that.

198
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,469
I've been keeping
this one a surprise.

199
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,938
It's "Channel 2."

200
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,506
What's that?

201
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,574
Good question.

202
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,676
The system has six channels.

203
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,910
Two of them are zero,

204
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:44,817
then there's one,
two, three, and four.

205
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,987
Naturally, each dock
has its own set of capabilities.

206
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,089
[NAMI] We know the
zeroes are for paddling,

207
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,825
and we've already seen
one and three, but--

208
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,793
[USOPP] Didn't you tell us

209
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,695
a while back that docks
2 and 4 were empty?

210
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,630
[FRANKY laughs]

211
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,466
I just told you that so
I could surprise you later!

212
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,983
[FRANKY] Soldier Dock System,
Channel 2! Launch!

213
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,785
Ooooh! I can't
wait to see what it is!

214
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,025
[FRANKY]
A paddleship shopping boat!

215
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,894
Not bad, huh?
I call it. Mini Merry 2.

216
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,529
[USOPP] It's really Merry!

217
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,566
Our Merry's been reborn
as a landing craft!

218
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,168
She may be tiny, but I'm
happy to ride her again!

219
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,918
All right! Hold on
to your seats, boys!

220
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,766
Wait a second,
turn back! Stop! Stop!

221
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,734
Don't you worry!
I got this!

222
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,749
Now this is one surprise

223
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,751
that was definitely
worth the wait!

224
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,920
Thanks, Franky! I love it!

225
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:28,954
With a ship like that,

226
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,691
I can go shopping for food
in style any time I want!

227
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,192
Hurry up and
let me ride it!

228
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,960
Hurry up and let me ride it!

229
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,230
Gotta say, that was
pretty thoughtful of you.

230
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,267
Heh! Hold your horses, pal.

231
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,036
We'll have our chance to take
her for a ride soon enough.

232
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,706
For now, how 'bout we let those
three have a little fun?

233
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,041
[LUFFY] So, is that all
the dock stuff, or what?

234
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,243
Mm-hmmm.
Including channel 1 and 3,

235
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,947
that I showed you before,
now you've seen it all.

236
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,616
Channel Zero. Support Paddle.

237
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,086
Channel One.
A single-seat waver.

238
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,221
The White Hobby Horse!

239
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,825
Channel Three. A triple-seater
scouting submarine.

240
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,827
The Shark Submerge Three.

241
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,129
And then, Channel 2.

242
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,833
A four person shopping
boat, the Mini Merry 2.

243
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,835
For now at least,
those are all the features

244
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,837
of the ship's
Soldier Dock System.

245
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,972
If you think of the Sunny
as our "mother ship,"

246
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:20,906
then these guys are

247
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,675
all the little soldiers
that help her out.

248
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,909
Yeah! I love it!

249
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,311
You're a genius, Franky!

250
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,012
Keep it up! Good boy!

251
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,914
Good! Good! Good!

252
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,683
Hell yeah!
What can I say?

253
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,352
I guess I'm extra
awesome this week, huh?

254
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,821
Super!

255
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,655
[NAMI screams]

256
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,790
Nami?

257
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,193
Nami! What's wrong?

258
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,995
You're not in trouble, are you?

259
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:47,666
Hm? Can't see a
damn thing out there.

260
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,368
It's just fog and more fog.

261
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,707
It sounded like it
came from the island.

262
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,308
No fair!

263
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,878
You gotta come back so
I can ride the Mini Merry, too!

264
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,813
What? That's all
you're worried about?

265
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,214
What about Nami?

266
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,316
[FRANKY] Chopper and Usopp
are out there too, you know.

267
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,051
Just sayin'.

268
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,186
I wonder.

269
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,989
Perhaps they fell victim
to a curse from that ghost.

270
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,057
C'mon, that's not funny.

271
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,899
[SANJI] What was that?

272
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,067
[LUFFY] That's crazy--the
anchor just dropped on its own!

273
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,402
I just built it,

274
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,404
so there's no way that
the gears got loose.

275
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,906
Well either way, pull it up!

276
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,074
We can't have the ship
lose its balance now!

277
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:32,845
That's weird.

278
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,914
Did somebody touch the hatch?

279
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,683
[SANJI] No. We were
right here the whole time.

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,372
Hey! Now is
not the time for this crap!

281
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,408
Could you take things
seriously for once?

282
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,410
Wait! It's not me!

283
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,278
I-I swear I'm not doing this.

284
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,053
Look out!

285
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,893
You nuts? What're
you trying to pull here?

286
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,230
No! I just-- it
moved on its own.

287
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,799
This is strange.

288
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,470
I got a hunch.
We're not alone here.

289
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,405
[growling]

290
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,907
[gasps]

291
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,885
Then there's
an enemy on this ship.

292
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,618
So you think it's a
ghost doing this stuff?

293
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,087
Or is it someone with
a Devil Fruit power?

294
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,758
Who, or whatever it is,
at least we know they're close.

295
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,926
Just now.

296
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,194
I heard what sounded like
some sort of beast growling.

297
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,930
A beast?

298
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,765
Right now, I'm more
concerned about Nami.

299
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,633
You guys take care of the boat.

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,768
What're you gonna do?

301
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,269
I'm gonna swim
over to the island

302
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,004
and rescue her, of course!

303
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,013
Whoa! That was lame!

304
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,382
[LUFFY] Sanji!
I didn't know you could fly!

305
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,717
[FRANKY] He can't, can he?

306
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,955
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!

307
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,358
Hey, you, uh,
havin' problems?

308
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,025
Shut up, damn it!

309
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,827
You saw what happened to me!

310
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,129
Whatever it is, it wants
to keep us on the ship.

311
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,898
We can't see
this bastard at all.

312
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,132
It could take us out one by one

313
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,134
and we couldn't do
a damn thing about it.

314
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,035
[ROBIN gasps]

315
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,037
What's going on, Robin?

316
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,373
Something is grabbing me.

317
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,407
[slurps]

318
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,208
You bastard!

319
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,010
Get your invisible
hands off her!

320
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,183
[growls]

321
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,318
[LUFFY] It really does
sound like some kinda animal.

322
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,089
[loud rumble]

323
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,256
[LUFFY] What is it now?

324
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,324
[FRANKY] Look!

325
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,158
I dunno what's going on,

326
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,194
but we've got
waves inside the wall!

327
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,268
They're pushing
us away from the island!

328
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,004
I got you. You okay?

329
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,339
I think so.
It seems to be gone.

330
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,675
Quick! Raise the anchor--
if you think you can do it

331
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,076
without falling
on your face again.

332
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,212
At least I'm not
throwing swords!

333
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,781
Usopp! Chopper! Say something!

334
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:57,516
Crap!

335
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,251
We're gonna get
separated from them!

336
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,219
[LUFFY] Hey, Franky.

337
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,754
You've gotta have some
kinda secret weapon

338
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,188
for a time like this!

339
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,023
[FRANKY] All right!

340
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,924
I'll bust out the
surprise hot tub!

341
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,360
[LUFFY] Whee!
Sounds like fun!

342
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,362
Wait, no!

343
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,955
That was quite the fall.

344
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,925
That wall must be
6 or 7 meters high.

345
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,994
We're lucky we're still okay.

346
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,997
What is this place?

347
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,765
[NAMI] It's that
ghost island, of course.

348
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,067
Ghost?

349
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,967
Aaaaah!!

350
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,969
What? Don't act like
you're surprised!

351
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,272
We've already been
over this, haven't we?

352
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,509
But if we were up there
how did we get down here?

353
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,344
We got excited
about the Mini Merry

354
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,780
and before we knew it,
we hit the shore.

355
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,248
We didn't notice it,

356
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,284
but the wall up there
is the edge of the island.

357
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,187
When we ran into it, we were
all thrown off the boat.

358
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,958
Then, we landed
in this moat here.

359
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,294
Now I admit that was
100% my fault, but--

360
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,463
I'm cute, so you'll
forgive me, right?

361
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,865
Yeah, right after I smack you!

362
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,935
Anyway, what I don't get
is why they have a moat

363
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
on the other side of the
wall right at the entrance.

364
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,038
What's the point?

365
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,273
From the looks of things,
it's some kind of trap.

366
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,475
If you think of it that way,

367
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,444
we're lucky we didn't fall on
any spears or giant spikes.

368
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
You're right.

369
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,280
It's a good thing we had
all these skeletons here

370
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,016
to cushion our fall, huh?

371
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:38,984
Aaaah!!

372
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,186
Would you stop
that already?

373
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,522
Hey, but we're still
near the entrance, right?

374
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,959
If we stay put for a while,
Luffy will come and find us!

375
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,961
[CHOPPER] He might try,
but we're below sea level.

376
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,230
Doesn't that put us
in a bad spot?

377
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,231
[USOPP] Good point.

378
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,833
If we stay here,
then they might not notice us.

379
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,902
In that case, we should
find a way out of this pit

380
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,537
and wait for them by the shore.

381
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,541
I guess so, but which
way should we go?

382
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,976
It all looks bad!

383
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:10,883
[growling]

384
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,986
What the heck
is that thing? A dog?

385
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,992
That's no dog.

386
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,394
Huh? Then what is it?

387
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:28,567
Oh no. It can't
be--C-C-Cerberus?

388
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:29,935
Ruff!

389
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,335
Roof!

390
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,004
Rawr!

391
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,510
Wait. What the
heck's a Cerberus?

392
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,344
You don't know?

393
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,079
It's the guardian
of the underworld!

394
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,447
Oh, come on,
there's no way that's real!

395
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,217
Look at it! You got
a better explanation?

396
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,354
So did we die
and go to the underworld?

397
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,957
No! Don't
even say that!

398
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,863
[USOPP] If we stop,
it'll eat us! Keep running!

399
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,038
Ruff! Ruff!

400
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,307
Roof! Roof!

401
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,609
Rawr!

402
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,310
Hmm?

403
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:11,610
Ruff!

404
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:12,211
Roof!

405
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:12,611
Rawr!

406
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,145
Ruff!

407
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:13,478
Roof!

408
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,146
Rawr!

409
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:14,446
Ruff!

410
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:14,980
Roof!

411
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,048
Rawr!

412
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,882
[CHOPPER] Hm?

413
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,151
Did you notice
something, Chopper?

414
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,152
What is it?

415
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,220
[CHOPPER] That bark.

416
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:21,553
Ruff!

417
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:21,887
Roof!

418
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,487
Rawr!

419
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:22,788
Ruff!

420
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,088
Roof!

421
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,456
Rawr!

422
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,424
[CHOPPER] Hey! I'm onto you!

423
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,327
One of your heads is
a fox head, isn't it?

424
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,664
[USOPP] I think it's depressed.

425
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,234
Guess it's
sensitive about it.

426
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,507
[USOPP] I liked it better
when it was yelping!

427
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,243
[NAMI] See! It is sensitive!

428
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,578
[CHOPPER] I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

429
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,014
[NAMI] Look! I see stairs!

430
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,616
Now we can get up to the shore!

431
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,518
[CHOPPER and USOPP]
We're saved!

432
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,665
[NAMI] What now?
They won't stop!

433
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,034
[CHOPPER] I thought
the stairs would help!

434
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,604
[USOPP] Smoke Star!

435
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,046
For a dog,
its sense of smell sure is bad!

436
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,648
It's gone.

437
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,483
But what now?

438
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,586
It chased us all the way
into this creepy forest!

439
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,989
That monster is still
roaming around down there!

440
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,357
If we climb to the ground
and wait for help,

441
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,758
it could find us again!

442
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,994
[VOICE]
Quite the quandary, isn't it?

443
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:11,496
Aaaahhh!!!

444
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,031
Who are you?

445
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,334
Pardon my manners,
the name's Hildon.

446
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,336
Oh, and speaking of bad manners.

447
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,171
I was spying on all of you.

448
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,406
That dog really
seemed to scare you.

449
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,175
[USOPP] I wasn't scared!

450
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,347
[distant howling]

451
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,783
[HILDON] The night
has just begun,

452
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,120
but already the shadows
in the forest are deep.

453
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,423
Soon, it shall be transformed
into a world of terror,

454
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,226
far beyond your
worst nightmares.

455
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,397
[laughs]

456
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:50,202
[HILDON] Might I
recommend you take a ride

457
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,703
with me in my carriage?

458
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,306
We could go to the
mansion together.

459
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,640
Mansion?

460
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,075
[HILDON] Of course.

461
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:00,412
Dr. Hogback's abode
is just up the way.

462
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,646
Huh?!

463
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,048
Huh? What?

464
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,783
Do you know him Chopper?

465
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,052
Doctor Hogback?

466
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,724
[USOPP and NAMI]
I don't get it.

467
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,166
[CHOPPER] I never thought
I'd get to meet Dr. Hogback!

468
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,601
I mean, he's a legend!

469
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,269
[NAMI] Never heard of him.
What does he do?

470
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,237
[CHOPPER]
He's saved as many lives

471
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,506
as there are stars
in the sky, of course!

472
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,674
[NAMI] Then what's he
doing at this creepy place?

473
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,410
[CHOPPER] Do you think
I can get his autograph?

474
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,744
Or is that too forward?

475
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,646
[NAMI] I think you
need to calm down!

476
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,581
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

477
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,252
"The Man Called a Genius!
Hogback Makes His Appearance!"

478
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,354
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
