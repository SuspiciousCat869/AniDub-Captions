1
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,022
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,759
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,327
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,330
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:44,864
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,668
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,369
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,305
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,175
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,811
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,345
of the World Government,

12
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,848
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,252
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,355
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,792
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:16,529
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,102
[NARRATOR]
After the Navy's victory

18
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,471
and the loss of both
Ace and Whitebeard,

19
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,540
the war at Marineford
has finally ended.

20
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,309
But this is a story
from another time.

21
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:34,715
Ten years ago, in the East Blue,
when Luffy first met Ace.

22
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,217
I won't do it.

23
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,386
We're finished here, brat.

24
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,758
Let him go!

25
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,661
[LUFFY]
"I Won't Run!

26
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,897
Ace's Desperate
Rescue Operation!"

27
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,244
Porchemy!

28
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,545
It's that damn kid!

29
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,813
He's got the money!

30
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,815
That brat!

31
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,615
[growls]

32
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,617
Huh?

33
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,319
Ace! You're here!

34
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,655
[ACE roars]

35
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,792
[PORCHEMY]
Thanks for showin' up, kid.

36
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,028
You saved us some trouble.

37
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,229
Your friend ain't squealin'.

38
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,464
He's pretty tough.

39
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,165
But I think you'll talk!

40
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,933
Ace!

41
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,369
S-Sabo... Do it!

42
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,609
Boss, are you okay?

43
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,113
Ace. Sabo.

44
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,682
[PORCHEMY]
That kind of hurt.

45
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:42,983
Who hit me?

46
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:43,984
You?

47
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,721
You punks don't get
who you're messing with!

48
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,356
Yeah.

49
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,090
You're all dead meat!

50
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,959
[ACE]
Shut your mouth and fight!

51
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:52,660
Sabo!

52
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:53,560
Help Luffy!

53
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,262
You guys.

54
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,664
One thing.

55
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,465
That ugly dude has a sword!

56
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,100
Be careful!

57
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,147
No way!

58
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,482
Porchemy, that other
kid got our knife--!

59
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,854
[SABO]
Quick, make a run for it!

60
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,088
[ACE]
You go ahead!

61
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,757
What? Ace!

62
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,258
Let's just leave!

63
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,361
[ACE]
I don't run from my enemies.

64
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:28,162
Ever!

65
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,796
Got it?

66
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,399
[PORCHEMY] And I don't
go easy on my enemies!

67
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,167
Come on!

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,468
These guys aren't just thugs!

69
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,836
They're Bluejam pirates!

70
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,604
Yeah, you got that right!

71
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,541
Now, I'm done
playing games here.

72
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,809
You've got something
that belongs to us.

73
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,879
Be good and give
it back, you brat!

74
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,782
You're just a kid and I don't
blame you for actin' stupid,

75
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,551
but fork over the cash
or you'll regret it.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,056
We've got
better plans for it.

77
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,090
That's our money now.

78
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,695
Then you are dead!

79
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,997
Hold on a sec,
I'll be right back.

80
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:06,767
Oh, great, not this again!

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,470
Really like to dig
your heels in, don'tcha?

82
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,471
Shut up.

83
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,605
Let's fight!

84
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,874
That's enough of this crap!

85
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,881
I'm not gonna lose, ya hear?

86
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,850
I'd rather just kill myself!

87
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,820
Not if we do it first!

88
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,787
Come at me, ya pricks!

89
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:46,307
I heard the whole
damn story, Porchemy.

90
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,108
You should be ashamed.

91
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,177
[BLUEJAM PIRATE]
Did you seriously get beaten

92
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,446
by a couple of kids?

93
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,447
Yeah.

94
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,916
Forgive me, Captain.

95
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,150
The money--

96
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,887
I've heard enough of this!

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,555
You're not fit for my crew!

98
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,257
[two gunshots]

99
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:11,131
Now then, which one of you
will get my money back?

100
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,768
We gotta show those punks
we're not letting it go

101
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,536
without a fight, got it?

102
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,870
Yes, Captain.

103
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,772
We'll have it back right away.

104
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:28,615
[sobs loudly]

105
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,051
Ace, that was really not cool.

106
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,987
Those guys were actual pirates!

107
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,655
Next time, we run.

108
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,892
Whatever your deal is,
it's not worth dying over.

109
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:38,959
This sucks.

110
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:42,196
I liked my old one better.

111
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,197
[sighs]

112
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,831
We made a huge mistake.

113
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,900
Pissing off pirates
like that, man.

114
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,702
They probably
told their captain.

115
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,571
What are we supposed to do now?

116
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:51,838
That was scary!

117
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,975
I thought I was gonna die!

118
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:57,945
[yells]

119
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,112
Would you shut up?

120
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,348
You're not hurt that bad!

121
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,982
So, stop crying already!

122
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,884
When're you gonna
stop being a baby?

123
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,419
Don't you want to be pirate?

124
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,757
[LUFFY]
Th-Thank you!

125
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:16,396
You...

126
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,299
You saved me!

127
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,099
Stop it!

128
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,234
[SABO]
Calm down!

129
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,502
He's just happy, okay?

130
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,307
All right.

131
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,341
What gives?

132
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,142
Why didn't you tell
them what they wanted?

133
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,678
You think they wouldn't kill
you 'cause you're a kid?

134
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,114
Those guys don't give a damn!

135
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:38,618
I was afraid... that you
wouldn't be my friend.

136
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,020
Yeah? Well, so what?

137
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,555
That still beats dying, right?

138
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,958
Besides, why do you
want to be my friend?

139
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,526
That's dumb!

140
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,362
Because...

141
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,963
[ACE] It's not like
I've been nice to you!

142
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,499
In fact, I've been giving
you hell ever since we met!

143
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,534
It's been months!

144
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,335
Why haven't you just given up?

145
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,342
[LUFFY]
Well...

146
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,344
'Cause...

147
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,446
'Cause I... I got no
one else to turn to!

148
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,016
I can't go back
to Windmill Village!

149
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,285
I don't like the
mountain bandits, either!

150
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,588
I'd be alone all the time
if I didn't follow you!

151
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:18,892
Getting beat up hurts,
but being lonely hurts more!

152
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,595
Alone? Why?

153
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,964
Gramps is all I have.

154
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,068
[ACE]
You feel better around me?

155
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,669
Uh-huh.

156
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,404
[ACE]
Otherwise you feel lonely?

157
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,972
Uh-huh.

158
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,944
[MAN A]
Do I think Gold Roger had a kid?

159
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,345
[laughs]

160
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,081
If he did, then too bad
for that poor runt!

161
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:41,882
No kidding!

162
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,250
They'd put him to death!

163
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,219
He'd probably deserve it too!

164
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,620
I bet!

165
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,096
[ACE]
Do you think I deserve to live?

166
00:09:58,398 --> 00:09:59,132
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

167
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,002
Of course I do!

168
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:06,073
I see.

169
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,407
But you're still annoying.

170
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,143
Weak little
crybabies piss me off.

171
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,279
[LUFFY]
Nuh-uh.

172
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,347
I'm not weak!

173
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,848
I'm really strong!

174
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:15,716
Ha!

175
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,117
You think you're really strong?

176
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:19,720
You were crying your eyes out
the whole time you were tied up!

177
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,622
Have you ever gotten hit
by a spiky thing that big?

178
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,091
I'm just seven years old!

179
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,126
Wait till I turn ten
years old like you guys,

180
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,963
and then I'll be stronger
and won't cry anymore!

181
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,498
Age has nothing to
do with it, you brat!

182
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,500
Hell, when I was
seven I was tough!

183
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:34,435
[LUFFY]
So what?

184
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,269
I'm gonna be so
tough you're gonna cry!

185
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,372
I promised Shanks I'd be
a great pirate someday

186
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,074
and that means way
greater than you!

187
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,841
[ACE]
Ha! You'll be a crappy pirate.

188
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,442
[LUFFY]
Nuh-uh!

189
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:42,976
[ACE]
Yeah-huh!

190
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,010
[LUFFY]
Nuh-uh!

191
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,781
Okay, enough of that!

192
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:49,183
Jeez.

193
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:50,250
Now, listen.

194
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,719
In case you guys forgot,
we got a problem here.

195
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,720
A problem?

196
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,221
[SABO]
Mm.

197
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,491
Bluejam and his buddies are
bound to come looking for us

198
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,959
after what
happened back there,

199
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,260
and like you said,
they don't care if

200
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,462
we're kids, they'll kill us
without a second thought.

201
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,231
Yeah. Probably.

202
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:05,799
[SABO] This forest
where I've been living

203
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,834
is awfully close
to their hideout.

204
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,336
the Cove of Pirates.

205
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,439
What if one night
I'm a little too tired,

206
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:13,040
sleep a little too hard,

207
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,909
and they sneak up on me?

208
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:15,909
You're dead.

209
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:16,643
[LUFFY]
Mm.

210
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,911
Yeah, way dead.

211
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:20,247
[SABO]
Right.

212
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,616
So, I need your help.

213
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,417
Here, I've got an idea.

214
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,606
[DOGRA]
What's with all the bandages?

215
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,275
Have they been fighting
bears or something?

216
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,013
That's not the problem.

217
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:57,985
[DOGRA]
Hey! Boss!

218
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:58,952
Come quick!

219
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,387
This isn't good!

220
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,222
[DADAN]
Hmm?

221
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,090
Gimme a sec, it's early.

222
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,591
Huh?

223
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,227
What have those brats
been up to now?

224
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,061
One.

225
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,430
Two.

226
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,531
Huh?

227
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,566
One.

228
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,134
Two.

229
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,235
Huh?

230
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,103
Ace.

231
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,437
Luffy.

232
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,573
Huh?

233
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,174
Wait a sec.

234
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,513
Ace, Luffy. Huh?
Ace, Luffy. Huh?

235
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:26,813
Okay.

236
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,349
Okay. Let's work this out.

237
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,119
Ace, Luffy, Huh?
Ace, Luffy, Huh?

238
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,588
Ace! Luffy! Huh?

239
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,925
Ace! Luffy! Who's
that other kid with you?

240
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,126
[groans]

241
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,027
Who's what now?

242
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,763
Come on!

243
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,766
It's too early for questions,
pipe down, will ya?

244
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,406
[DADAN] Ugh!
Two brats is already too many!

245
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,808
Who the hell are you?

246
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,811
You mean me?

247
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:58,446
Ah.

248
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,580
Right!

249
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,348
Hi! I'm Sabo!

250
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,182
Huh?

251
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:03,350
Ace's friend?

252
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,484
I see.

253
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:05,385
Oh, good!

254
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,854
It's like I'm
already living here!

255
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,522
And you must be Dadan, right?

256
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,057
Hiya!

257
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,958
"Living here"?

258
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,059
Listen up, kid.

259
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,794
Nobody said you could stay.

260
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,095
[farts]

261
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,230
Don't answer me with a fart!

262
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,166
[chuckles]

263
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,167
[farts]

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,536
Hey, quit farting in my house!

265
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,603
You're just as worthless

266
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,139
as those other two
low-lifes moochin' off me!

267
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,407
[SABO]
Oh, yeah?

268
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:29,944
Well, I heard that you're
a worthless old hag yourself!

269
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,745
[farts]

270
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,615
Pull that crap one more time
and you're out of here!

271
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,516
Actually, you're out anyway!

272
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,686
I ain't watchin'
any more brats!

273
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,721
I also heard that
you're a nice old hag

274
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,156
that wouldn't leave a kid
like me to die in the woods.

275
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,924
Huh?

276
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,492
And you're a tough old hag too,

277
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,761
so I'll be sure
to mind my manners.

278
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,663
Okay, the tough
part is true, but...

279
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,565
..stop calling me a hag!

280
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,200
You stupid brats.

281
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,168
[SABO chuckles]

282
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,938
[DADAN growls]

283
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,507
[SABO chuckles]

284
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,280
[DADAN growls]

285
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,181
[sighs]

286
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,018
[DADAN]
Luffy! Ace! Sabo!

287
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,619
There aren't any free rides!

288
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,388
You twerps better be grateful
and get to work this instant!

289
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,657
[chuckles]

290
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,326
You got it! Thank you!

291
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,547
[ALL THREE]
See ya!

292
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,916
[DADAN]
Hey! Get back here, Luffy!

293
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,853
This house ain't
gonna clean itself!

294
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,923
Cleaning is boring! Nyaaah!

295
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,692
Hey, Ace! Sabo! Wait for me!

296
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,227
Ugh! Damn brats.

297
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,028
I shoulda known!

298
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,963
Oops, hold it!

299
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,001
Forgot to tell them!

300
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,002
Hey, Dadan!

301
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,771
You might get some guests later!

302
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,773
We pissed off Bluejam,
so he probably wants us dead!

303
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,575
Play it cool, okay?

304
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,378
Hold on--is this
supposed to be a joke?

305
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,546
I'm lost.

306
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,149
It's true!

307
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,517
We beat his crew up!

308
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,653
And that's why
I had to move here!

309
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:21,588
Later!

310
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,590
Wha?

311
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,361
Dadan's cool!

312
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,529
I really like how she just
lets us do whatever we want!

313
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,999
Meh, she's still
a worthless old hag.

314
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:32,599
Yeah!

315
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:33,801
And she's real ugly!

316
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:34,835
Like a butt!

317
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:35,736
[laughs]

318
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,038
Anyway, now what?

319
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,607
Well, first off.

320
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,976
Let's eat!

321
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,144
[sighs]

322
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,612
Haha! 'Kay, time to eat!

323
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,189
Gotta keep our strength up.

324
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:09,770
[SABO]
Hey, Luffy.

325
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,438
I heard you ate a Devil Fruit.

326
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,372
Is that true?

327
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,240
[LUFFY]
Yep!

328
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,140
I see.

329
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,911
So, that means
you can't swim, huh?

330
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,312
Here, you can have the tail.

331
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,382
Thanks, Sabo!

332
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,918
You're too nice.

333
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:24,752
Yeah?

334
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,520
What's wrong with that?

335
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,889
So, which fruit did you eat?

336
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,091
Gum-Gum Fruit!

337
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:31,425
Gum-Gum.

338
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,260
What's that?

339
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,429
[LUFFY]
Like rubber!

340
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,031
Who wants to be made of rubber?

341
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,498
And you can't even swim?

342
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,566
That's so lame.

343
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,368
No, it's totally awesome!

344
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,236
'Cause I've got all
these cool special moves

345
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,638
that only I can do!

346
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,339
Fine.

347
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,475
You win. You win.

348
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,144
But if your "special moves"
are so cool,

349
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,178
why don't you make one

350
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,480
that'll catch us some fish,
you freeloader?

351
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,151
His whole body really
is made of rubber!

352
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,218
That's neat!

353
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,753
Leggo of my face!

354
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:07,060
Huh, you know, if you got in
a fight, stretching or bouncing,

355
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:10,430
it might actually
be kinda handy.

356
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,532
Huh?

357
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,666
Uh-huh!

358
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,867
It is!

359
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,036
And I just made up
my best move yet!

360
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,138
I call this one the
"Gum-Gum Balloon"!

361
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:21,108
It can bounce back cannonballs
and bullets and lots of stuff!

362
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:21,942
Whoa!

363
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,344
Can you show me right now?

364
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,412
[LUFFY]
Sure, I'll do it just for you!

365
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,581
That meanie
doesn't get to see it.

366
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,049
Don't peek!

367
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,450
Here we go!

368
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,953
Gum-Gum...

369
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,358
[gasps]

370
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,260
Dude, that's nuts!

371
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:40,661
You keep getting bigger!

372
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,629
You're not gonna pop, are you?

373
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,564
[LUFFY]
...Balloon!

374
00:17:44,598 --> 00:17:45,532
Cool, huh?

375
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,634
Everything bounces right off!

376
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:51,572
[SABO] Well, not sure
I'd use the word "cool."

377
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:54,541
[ACE] And you bounce
right off my foot!

378
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,177
[LUFFY]
What are you doing?

379
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,843
Sabo!

380
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:58,345
Kick him back here!

381
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,614
Oh. Uh-huh.

382
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,618
[LUFFY]
Stop it you guys!

383
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,721
You're right Luffy, your
Gum-Gum moves are pretty neat!

384
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:09,690
[LUFFY]
Stop it!

385
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,459
Hey, if you can
block cannonballs,

386
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,226
then try blocking this!

387
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:21,602
[yells]

388
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:22,936
[scream]

389
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,742
[scream]

390
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,211
[ACE, SABO]
Wait!

391
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:33,880
You can't just eat a guy
then run away like that!

392
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,850
Spit him out!

393
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,356
[ACE, SABO]
Die!

394
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,398
Yeah, sometimes
that happens, right?

395
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,399
No, it doesn't!

396
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,900
I almost got eaten back there.

397
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,069
Don't try to play it off!

398
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:56,403
[ACE]
Get over it.

399
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,505
We got lots of crocodile meat
for dinner, so it worked out.

400
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,508
Good point!

401
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,911
That was fast.

402
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:07,147
[LUFFY] But I wanna have
some crocodile right now.

403
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,116
I can't wait till dinner.

404
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:09,950
[SABO]
Ace!

405
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,984
[ACE]
Hmm?

406
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,520
Uh, before we get back
to the hag's place,

407
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,255
I wanna check something.

408
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,089
Can you come with me?

409
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,834
[HOODLUM AA]
See anything in there?

410
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,769
[HOODLUM BB]
Look carefully!

411
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:29,870
[SABO]
Man.

412
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,938
It's a good thing we moved
our pirate savings.

413
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,106
[ACE]
Yeah.

414
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,408
While we're at it, you wanna
check Gray Terminal too?

415
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,810
Good idea.

416
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,046
Ace, Luffy, you two head back.

417
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,847
I'll catch up.

418
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,748
Nuh-uh!

419
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,953
He won't listen to anyone.

420
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,527
Good grief.

421
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:57,198
This place is swarming with the
usual punks and Bluejam's guys!

422
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:59,566
And they mean business!

423
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,035
Well, what did you expect?

424
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,070
Bluejam's gotta be
super pissed right now.

425
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,308
Huh?

426
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:09,576
Hey, guys!

427
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,512
Those kids that you've been
looking for are right here,

428
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,046
all three of them!

429
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:15,816
[HOODLUM A]
He's right! Grab 'em!

430
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,083
Give it up!

431
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,786
There's a bounty on your head,
and I'm gonna cash it in!

432
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,690
[SABO sighs]

433
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:26,159
Well that just sucks.

434
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,896
Bluejam's got all of
Gray Terminal hunting us down.

435
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,464
We'd better lay low for now.

436
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:31,765
There's too many of them.

437
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,601
Here's hoping they get bored
and move onto something else.

438
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,170
Why should we hide?

439
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,539
If they find us,
then we can just fight them.

440
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,574
That's no reason
to pick a fight, though.

441
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:44,077
What, are we gonna beat up like
a hundred guys just because?

442
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:44,678
Yeah, Ace!

443
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,746
Sabo's right!

444
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,415
Nobody asked you.

445
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:52,953
[BANDIT BB]
Bluejam?

446
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,089
The kids sure know how
to screw us over!

447
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,323
I'm sure those pirates
are gonna find out

448
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,159
about this place pretty soon!

449
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,226
Aw, man.

450
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,628
We're gonna be in big trouble!

451
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,798
We're tough, but no way
we can beat Bluejam's men.

452
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,568
[DOGRA] Maybe this is
the end of the Dadan family!

453
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,636
We've had a great run guys.

454
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,341
but it's time to say goodbye
to the mountain bandit's life!

455
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,943
[BANDIT AA] All of our
crimes are coming back

456
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,511
to bite us in the ass!

457
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,379
Live by the sword,
die by the sword!

458
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,381
We should've known!

459
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:23,818
"Had a great run"?

460
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,985
"We can't beat them"?

461
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,355
How pathetic can
you numbskulls get?

462
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:28,622
Don't you take any pride

463
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,458
in being mountain bandits
all these years?

464
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:33,594
This is simple!

465
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,729
If they come by
asking for the brats,

466
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,698
we'll just hand Ace and Luffy

467
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,967
and that stupid
new kid right on over!

468
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,236
Yeah, but, Boss, there's Garp.

469
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,338
He'll get angry at us
if we do that!

470
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,807
Plus, that Bluejam
guy's a monster.

471
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,709
If he finds out we
even know those kids,

472
00:21:48,743 --> 00:21:52,479
he'll kill us just
for the hell of it.

473
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,215
Well... then...

474
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,950
[BANDITS]
Yes?

475
00:21:58,419 --> 00:21:59,720
Then we'll play dumb!

476
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,989
Yeah! Just pretend
we don't know them!

477
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,523
Now, let's try it!

478
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,659
Be real dumb!

479
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:06,393
Hey, guys.

480
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,728
Have you seen Ace and Sabo?

481
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,262
They staying here?

482
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:10,430
Spit it out or else!

483
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,666
We don't know.

484
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,870
That was bad.

485
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:17,671
[BANDIT C]
Boss!

486
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,605
Boss!

487
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,141
Ace and those
other brats are back!

488
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:37,224
[NARRATOR] Fearing for his life,
Sabo left Gray Terminal

489
00:22:37,258 --> 00:22:42,196
and found a home with Ace and
Luffy, much to Dadan's dismay.

490
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:46,266
For the three unwanted guests,
it was a never-ending party.

491
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:49,270
Making any excuse to get
out of their daily chores,

492
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:51,738
they hunted wild
animals in the mountains,

493
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:53,807
tussled with
hooligans in the city,

494
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,944
and dueled with
pirates at the cove.

495
00:22:56,977 --> 00:23:01,215
Within time, news of their wild
exploits reached far and wide,

496
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,683
even over the high walls

497
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,517
surrounding the center
of the kingdom.

498
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,162
[NARRATOR]
Luffy, Ace, and Sabo

499
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,099
make a name for
themselves in Gray Terminal.

500
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:20,367
While celebrating
their latest victory,

501
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,069
a surprising truth
about Sabo is revealed,

502
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,405
and the boys make
a promise to one another

503
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,874
that will shape their future.

504
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,676
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

505
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,647
"To the Sea Someday!
The Pledge of the Three Brats!"

506
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,016
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
