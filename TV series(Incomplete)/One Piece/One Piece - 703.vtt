00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:34.308
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:36.947
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.289
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:41.322 --> 00:02:44.295
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.865
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.371
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:49.405 --> 00:02:53.680
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:57.187
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.125
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.195
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.734
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.272
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:07.709
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:07.743 --> 00:03:10.146
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.151
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:14.288
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.562
And for Law, it turns out
the fight was personal.

00:03:17.595 --> 00:03:20.267
Law has had a complicated
past with Doflamingo,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.770
and his brother Corazon.

00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:26.345
Their connection began with
a twist of fate 16 years ago.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.855
[LAW]
It's Trafalgar D. Water Law.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.491
The "D." is secret.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:35.598
My true name is Water.
For generations, my family...

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.504
[LAW gasps]
H-Hey, what are you doing?

00:03:38.537 --> 00:03:41.008
What's the big deal, Corazon?

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:45.986
What you just said. Was it true?

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.456
Your secret name's "D."?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.964
If that's right, you need to
get the hell outta here.

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:53.834
Away from Doffy.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:56.305
Law! Listen.

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.110
You cannot be around him.

00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:00.480
You have to get out of here!

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.290
[LUFFY]
"A Rocky Road!

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:08.697
Law and Corazon's
Journey of Life!"

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:24.596
You're talking?
Since when can you speak?

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.639
Always could.

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:36.587
You mean, you've lied to
your brother this whole time?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.793
I never once indicated
to him that I became mute.

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:42.599
That is a crazy assumption
the guy made on his own.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:44.769
That's lying!
What's wrong with you?

00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:46.507
You're being deceitful
by not correcting him!

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.548
[ROSINANTE]
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Silence, now!

00:04:56.894 --> 00:04:59.766
[inaudible]

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.974
[LAW gasps]
What the hell happened?

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:11.155
[gasps] All the sound stopped!

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:14.261
Where'd it go? How?

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.165
It looks like
people are talking,

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.868
but I can't hear anything!

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:21.108
[ROSINANTE] You were being loud,
so took a counter measure.

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:22.779
They can't hear us.

00:05:22.812 --> 00:05:26.186
Just like how you can't
hear a peep from outside.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.124
I put up a sound-proof
wall to cover us.

00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:33.700
You won't see it.
It's invisible.

00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:44.055
I ate the Calm-Calm Fruit
and became a silent man.

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:45.390
[gasps]

00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:52.037
[LAW]
You have Devil Fruit powers?

00:05:56.613 --> 00:06:00.220
[LAW] Y-You're insane!
It's all been a lie?

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:03.694
Wait a sec. You faked the
accidents, too, didn't you?

00:06:03.727 --> 00:06:08.604
[ROSINANTE chuckles] That's
right. You're a sharp cookie.

00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:11.576
The whole clutz thing is an act.

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:14.582
You caught on fire
again, you liar!

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.405
I've been clumsy my whole life,
that won't change.

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:27.775
There. Y'happy now?

00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:28.944
Gimme a break!

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.816
You mean to tell me,
that's the only truth to you?

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.722
Why are you hiding all this
crap from your friends?

00:06:34.756 --> 00:06:36.593
[ROSINANTE]
They're not my friends.

00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:39.766
I'm with them,
but not by choice.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.339
Someone's gotta curb
my brother Doffy's rampage.

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:45.176
It's hard to believe
we're related.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.884
Our parents showed us
nothing but love, after all.

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.037
[ROSINANTE] But that monster
has no humanity.

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:15.470
[ROSINANTE crying]
Help me!

00:07:15.504 --> 00:07:18.276
Please, my boys are innocent!

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.282
Direct your arrows
at me, not them!

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:22.685
I beg you!

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:25.123
Please don't harm
my children anymore!

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:26.693
[ROSINANTE cries]

00:07:26.727 --> 00:07:32.170
Help, Daddy, it hurts
everywhere! I wanna die!

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:42.123
[TOWNSMEN gasp]

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.273
[DOFLAMINGO]
You'll pay for this.

00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:53.212
I'll get even. I swear it!

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:54.414
[HOMING gasps]

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:55.483
Doffy, no.

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:59.257
You wretches!
I won't die today!

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:07.509
I swear to survive whatever
torment you throw at me!

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.646
Remember my words!

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.685
I look forward to the day
that I hunt you down

00:08:12.718 --> 00:08:16.258
and murder every
single one of you!

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.070
[ROSINANTE]
He's dangerous.

00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:25.911
My brother's innately wicked
nature knows no bounds.

00:08:27.782 --> 00:08:29.719
[ROSINANTE] The only people
who have seen the full extent

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:34.194
of his brutality are the
four Executives, including me,

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:37.902
and the first Corazon, Vergo.

00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:38.937
Who's Vergo?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.209
An extremely
powerful individual.

00:08:41.242 --> 00:08:44.916
Right now he's away from the
Family on a secret operation.

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:47.755
But the details of that
are between him and Doffy.

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:51.563
That guy has nothing to do
with you, so forget about him.

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:53.534
[ROSINANTE]
Listen, Law.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.005
You can't turn into
a monster like my brother.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.608
Now scram. Quickly.

00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:59.345
[LAW]
No way! I'm not leaving!

00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:02.083
That's exactly what I wanna be!

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:05.791
[inaudible]

00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:07.796
Hm?

00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:11.202
[ROSINANTE] Look. You possess
the secret name of "D."

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:12.638
You realize what that means?

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:14.375
You're a part of a fateful few.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:17.948
Growing up, when children
misbehaved, we were told,

00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:22.090
"If you don't fall in line,
you'll be eaten alive by D."

00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:26.031
[ROSINANTE]
Every so often, another person

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:29.137
with "D." in their name
would gain public attention.

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:34.749
And you'd overhear the elderly
making passing comments like,

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:38.223
"D. will surely
bring a new storm."

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.660
The hell's that mean?

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.298
You're trying to say
I'm a monster, then?

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.834
[ROSINANTE]
Perhaps.

00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:48.076
The details are still unknown,

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:50.547
but that name's
survived for centuries

00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:53.486
and has been muttered
across the entire world.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.855
One more thing.

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:56.827
Those who fear
the inheritors of D.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.331
have given them another title.

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:04.643
"Sworn enemy of gods"!

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:05.911
[LAW gasps]

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.890
[LAW]
Gods?

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:14.729
[ROSINANTE] If Celestial Dragons
are "gods" in this analogy,

00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:16.900
the purpose of
your people might be

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:19.872
the "destruction of this world."

00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:23.078
But look.

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:26.853
This meaning of "destruction"
is different than Doffy's.

00:10:26.886 --> 00:10:30.827
It's a force that opposes
the order of heaven itself.

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:38.577
Why're you spouting
this crap at me?

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.982
I joined your dumb Family
for one purpose.

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.885
To kill people before I die!

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.956
Don't assume I wanna
work for you!

00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:47.360
I only answer to Doflamingo.

00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:48.864
What would I wanna leave for?

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:51.302
I'm just gonna die
in a year anyway!

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:53.473
There's gotta be a cure
out there somewhere.

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:57.816
Shut up! I'm so ratting
you out, sucker!

00:10:57.849 --> 00:10:59.685
Doflamingo'll be angry!

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:01.623
Hey, wait!

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:03.827
Bet he freaks out when
he learns you can talk!

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.365
[ROSINANTE]
You damn brat!

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.835

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:09.170
[ROSINANTE gasps]

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:14.716
I'm way stronger than
two years ago! Later, jerk!

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.118
[ROSINANTE shrieks]

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:20.894
You moron! You broke the
"Blood Law" a second time!

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:22.699
Hey. Why were you
moving your mouths,

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.936
but not saying anything?

00:11:26.105 --> 00:11:28.242
[LAW] I'll buy you both ice
cream if you shut up about it.

00:11:28.276 --> 00:11:31.616
[BUFFALO] Really? I'll take
a 500-Berry, King size cone!

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.420
[LAW]
Baby 5, can you spot me?

00:11:33.453 --> 00:11:35.958
[BABY 5]
Huh? O-Okay!

00:11:35.992 --> 00:11:40.199
Oh my gosh, he really
needs me for something!

00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:54.027
[ROSINANTE]
My time's up.

00:12:01.943 --> 00:12:05.450
[ROSINANTE] Dammit! I shouldn't
have trusted that kid.

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.588
I screwed up, royally.

00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:11.061
[ROSINANTE] I don't think
Doffy's made it back yet.

00:12:11.094 --> 00:12:14.869
I should have just enough time
to pack my crap and book it.

00:12:16.606 --> 00:12:18.577
[DOFLAMINGO]
Corazon!

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:19.879
[ROSINANTE]
What?

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:28.863
[ROSINANTE]
Dammit. He's already here.

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:37.749
Took ya long enough.

00:12:37.782 --> 00:12:39.418
We're about to set sail.

00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:41.422
The Navy's on our tail again.

00:12:41.455 --> 00:12:43.860
Tsuru's on her way. We gotta go.

00:12:43.893 --> 00:12:46.031
C'mon, haul ass!

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.273
[ROSINANTE]
Hasn't he said anything yet?

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:52.945
[LAW chuckles]

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:59.158
Heheh. I decided not to tell.

00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:01.428
I gave it some thought
and remembered

00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:05.069
that I owed you for keeping
quiet back when I stabbed you.

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:07.340
I'd call that about even.

00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:09.845
[LAW chuckles]

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.297
[DOFLAMINGO]
Hey! I said hurry it up!

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.068
What are you doing?

00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:34.028
[DIAMANTE]
Corazon's missing! Corazon!

00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.465
Anyone seen him or Law?

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.202
[LAO G]
What?

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.340
[GLADIUS] I swear I
saw them board together.

00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:41.543
They aren't here?

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:43.880
What are we chatting about?

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:49.091
We need the extra fire power
and I can't find either of them!

00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:51.428
And I looked everywhere!

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:56.071
Young Master! Found this
in Corazon's hammock.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.746
[SEÑOR] Looks like they
took off together.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:02.350
What the hell is he thinking?

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:07.360
[LAW grunting]

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.031
Untie me right now!

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:11.836
Do you realize you
