1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,704
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,506
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:10,243
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,314
In the Tower of Law,
Robin learned that Luffy

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,149
and the others had
come to rescue her.

6
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,170
Hold on!

7
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,171
That wasn't part
of our agreement!

8
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,406
In exchange for my
cooperation and surrender,

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,642
you promised that you'd let
the Straw Hats escape safely!

10
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,791
After allowing them
to leave Water 7 safely,

11
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:01,461
as promised, the Straw Hats
decided to come here.

12
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,398
These dirtbags are
the lowest of the low.

13
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,434
Not a shred of decency
in any one of 'em!

14
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,602
Huh?

15
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,071
What did you say?

16
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:13,574
Shut up, you
filthy piece of trash!

17
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,175
We're not under any obligation

18
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,378
to keep our promises
to a bunch of criminals!

19
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,445
You hear me?

20
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,215
Take that, and that, and that!

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,349
You, too!

22
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,486
Don't get cocky
with me, understand?

23
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,693
You coward.

24
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,100
The receiver is off the hook.

25
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,570
There's a Sea Prism Stone
lock on her restraints.

26
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,071
Make sure it's secure.

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,073
Cutty Flam goes to Impel Down

28
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,208
and Nico Robin to
Navy Headquarters.

29
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,476
As soon as the ship's ready,

30
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,412
we'll set sail through
the Gates of Justice.

31
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,149
You can return to
your quarters for now.

32
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,150
Thanks to this catch,

33
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,320
CP9 will be the toast
of Navy Headquarters.

34
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:02,289
And they're very
good at what they do.

35
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,391
Quite dependable.

36
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,427
As long as I have
them working for me,

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,395
there's nothing
I can't accomplish!

38
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,463
I'm invincible!

39
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,740
Meanwhile, with the help of
the Franky Family's King Bulls,

40
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,443
the Straw Hats pushed toward the
courthouse in pursuit of Luffy.

41
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,814
Get outta here!

42
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,815
Beat it!

43
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,183
Smooth sailing.

44
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,618
These two make it easy.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,321
Keep going until we reach
our Captain, King Bulls!

46
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,364
He said, "By the way,
the masked guy

47
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,499
that was with you never
made it on board my back.

48
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,000
Is that okay?"

49
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,742
He's talking about Sniper King!

50
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,577
Where is he?

51
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,711
Lieutenant Commander!

52
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,513
Terrible news!

53
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,481
What is it?

54
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,716
It's Straw Hat Luffy, sir!

55
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,454
We can't find him anywhere!

56
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,022
He gave us the slip!

57
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,592
Go!

58
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,695
We must find Straw Hat
at any cost, men!

59
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,397
After finally
evading the Marines,

60
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,266
Luffy reached the
roof of the courthouse.

61
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,370
This is the last building.

62
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,205
She's gotta be here.

63
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,410
Right.

64
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,613
What the heck?

65
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,414
Air Door.

66
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,292
Hey!

67
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,261
You're the bull who's working
with that stupid pigeon guy!

68
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,697
To be honest, it did
seem a little suspicious.

69
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,199
No way you only
took out 5 marines.

70
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,268
Man, you really surprised me!

71
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,770
An invasion like
this is unprecedented.

72
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,807
This is the furthest
anyone has infiltrated

73
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,110
into the mouth of the World
Government but that ends here.

74
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:10,617
Tell me.

75
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,553
How long do you
plan to keep fighting?

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,468
Until I die.

77
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,455
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

78
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,002
What're we gonna do?

79
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,739
It's too late now.

80
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,740
Even if we wanted to,

81
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,142
it's not like we could
go back and pick him up.

82
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,414
I'm sure he'll figure out
something or other.

83
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,050
But the whole island
is swarming with Marines.

84
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,518
He's not Luffy, after all.

85
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,353
He can't fight
them off on his own!

86
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,555
Even if we don't
realize it at first,

87
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,225
we've gotten stronger with
every challenge we've faced.

88
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,227
You may not think he's tough,

89
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,697
but he's survived as
well as anyone else.

90
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,133
No one from our crew would
die at a time like this.

91
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,068
Don't worry.

92
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,736
"From our crew?" Huh?

93
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,072
What're you talking about, Zoro?

94
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,676
Sniper King may be here to help
but he doesn't replace Usopp.

95
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,146
You don't know if he's
gonna be okay or not!

96
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,348
He'll be fine.

97
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:31,284
He is a super hero, after all.

98
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,121
You're right.

99
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,228
Sniper King would never
let evil triumph over good.

100
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,029
He can't lose!

101
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,504
Why'd I have to not
land on that King Bull?

102
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,206
What am I gonna do?

103
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,207
I'm way behind
everyone else now.

104
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,644
Battleship Cannon!

105
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,455
These shipwrights are awesome,

106
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,492
but I should probably
catch up with the others.

107
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,728
Then again, I did
leave the crew, didn't I?

108
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,596
Maybe I should just run away.

109
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,371
No, running is the
last thing I should do!

110
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,074
It doesn't matter whether
I'm a part of the crew or not.

111
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,276
I put on this disguise so
I could help my friends.

112
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,312
If Robin is willing to
sacrifice herself to save us,

113
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,080
it's the least I can do!

114
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,683
My manhood is on the line, here!

115
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,451
All right, there's only one way

116
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,686
to get back to the
others at this point.

117
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,756
I call it
"Operation Disguise Myself

118
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,426
as One of the Government
Agents and Walk Straight

119
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,128
to the Courthouse
Without Anyone Noticing."

120
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,063
Okay, let's do this.

121
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,073
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

122
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,140
They're flooding the island!

123
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,708
We're all gonna sink!

124
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,611
Huh?

125
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,015
The giant woke up!

126
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,753
We tried for
50 years and blew it.

127
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,488
We let our bosses down!

128
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,323
You mean the government?

129
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,126
We're a disgrace to
all the giants in Elbaf!

130
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:28,302
Elbaf. Giants?
Bosses? Wait a sec!

131
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,037
Are you saying
you're from Elbaf?

132
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,073
Like, the
Warrior's Village, Elbaf?

133
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,276
Who the hell are you, runt?

134
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,711
I'm Sniper King
from Sniper Island.

135
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:41,482
I'm interested in your story,
by all means, continue!

136
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:44,585
Never heard of you, and never
heard of Sniper Island either.

137
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,121
I don't gotta tell
you anything, okay?

138
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,455
Hey, calm down.

139
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,389
The warriors from Elbaf

140
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,592
are the proudest men
in the world, right?

141
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,561
I know you wouldn't be crying
if it wasn't a really big deal.

142
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,397
So tell me what's going on.

143
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,165
I won't judge, I promise!

144
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,635
Take your time.

145
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,771
There's not much
point in telling you,

146
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:06,273
but I guess it can't hurt.

147
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,779
Kashii and I used to
be pirates 100 years ago.

148
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,214
Our crew traveled
the whole world.

149
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,550
Back then, no one could stop us.

150
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:21,455
But everything changed when
we visited a certain island.

151
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,190
Cheers!

152
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,293
It's not every day someone
bags a huge Sea King!

153
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,428
And they each got one!

154
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,562
Now that's impressive!

155
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,096
Yeah!

156
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,629
Take us for example!

157
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,098
We're Elbaf giants!

158
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,700
No greater warrior exists!

159
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,634
But even we don't come close

160
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,303
to taking down one
of those massive beasts!

161
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,305
Wouldn't you say
that's fair, men?

162
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,709
I bet no one's ever slain
a bigger Sea-King than us!

163
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:47,581
A conquest destined
to become legend!

164
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,220
Awesome, so which
one was bigger!

165
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,054
Which?

166
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,323
One?

167
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,564
Look at them
side-by-side, Broggy!

168
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:05,299
Mine is slightly bigger, see?

169
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,266
Keep dreaming!

170
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,069
Mine beats yours by
three whole centimeters!

171
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:09,603
What?

172
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,038
You're joking!

173
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,439
You wish!

174
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,141
Bosses, please!

175
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,109
Stop bickering!

176
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,245
Since they couldn't
come to an agreement,

177
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,381
our two bosses started a duel.

178
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,815
They put their pride on the line

179
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,351
and would keep fighting
'til it was settled.

180
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,152
Who were we to stop them?

181
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,089
The signal for the duel.

182
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:32,826
We had to split up the crew.

183
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,328
We were at a loss.

184
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,797
All we could do was go
back to our hometowns.

185
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,199
He's gotta be talking
about Little Garden.

186
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,068
What else could it be?

187
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,038
A warrior's battle is
life-or-death but as soon as

188
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,207
it's over the winner is supposed
to come back to their village.

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,045
We waited for fifty years and
never heard from either of them.

190
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,780
Something was wrong.

191
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:56,116
So Kashii and I set out to
sea to go back to the island

192
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,784
and find out what
happened with the duel.

193
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,189
But on our way there, we got
captured by some Marines.

194
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,056
They forced us to answer

195
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,225
all kinds of questions
about our crew.

196
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,227
Then we found out the truth.

197
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,430
Even though our bosses
were strong fighters,

198
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,565
they got caught by
Marines just like us

199
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,068
and were stuck in
some big government jail!

200
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,102
Huh?

201
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,672
All of that stuff happened
about 50 years ago.

202
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,208
The government
made a deal with us.

203
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,444
They said if we would work
for them for 100 years,

204
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,613
they'd set our bosses free.

205
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:29,216
All we had to do was protect
this gate from intruders.

206
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,352
As long as we didn't
let anyone through,

207
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,220
when our time was up, our bosses

208
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:36,223
and us could all go
back to Elbaf together.

209
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,559
Since giants live
to be 300 or so,

210
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,294
we didn't think it was so bad.

211
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,328
So we agreed to the deal

212
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:44,431
and kept our end of
the bargain for 50 years.

213
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,400
But then those pirates
came through the gate

214
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,768
and ruined everything.

215
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,470
That's why I'm so ashamed!

216
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,771
That's why I'm crying!

217
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,306
It's not fair.

218
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,642
Now our bosses are gonna
be stuck in that dumb prison

219
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,576
for the rest of their lives!

220
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,346
Hey, hold on, wait a second.

221
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,081
There's something
funny about that story.

222
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,183
You think this is funny,
you little jerk!

223
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,586
How dare you laugh at our pride?

224
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,488
I don't mean like funny "ha ha."

225
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,290
I mean funny "weird."

226
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,458
And what's so weird about it?

227
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:14,061
Before we came here, my crew
met those bosses of yours.

228
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,529
And we saw them
fighting their duel!

229
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,468
Their names are
Dorry and Broggy, right?

230
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,170
The warriors from Elbaf.

231
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,406
Fighting in an
evenly-matched duel,

232
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,708
over and over again,
for 100 years!

233
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,714
How?

234
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,583
How do you know their names?

235
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,318
You must be lying.

236
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,686
If you need more
proof than that,

237
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,720
I can tell you
anything you want!

238
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,661
And then...

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,142
You still don't believe me?

240
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,177
What do I have to tell you?

241
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,017
Their weapons, maybe?

242
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,889
How they fight?

243
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,293
Seventy-three thousand, four
hundred and sixty-six duels.

244
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,794
I know everything about them!

245
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,632
Seventy-three thousand, four
hundred and sixty six draws.

246
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,200
We really met them.

247
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:30,270
I swear it!

248
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,563
Every one of you
fought like true warriors

249
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,099
in order to protect
the pride of our duel.

250
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,601
And because you
were willing to do that,

251
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,503
no matter what enemy
you may face--

252
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:05,506
We will never let them
destroy your pride, friends!

253
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,074
You must go straight ahead.

254
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,775
Have faith in what we say!

255
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,748
Let's meet again someday.

256
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,252
Absolutely.

257
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,792
Go straight!
Go straight! Go Straight!

258
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:25,693
What does it matter?

259
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:26,727
We've already been eaten!

260
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,595
Straight, okay?

261
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:28,762
Keep going!

262
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,006
Hakoku!

263
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:47,047
We're flying!

264
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,485
They cut the sea itself.

265
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:56,356
The strength of Elbaf
is just too amazing!

266
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,328
Friends!

267
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,731
Take care!

268
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:06,467
I looked to them as
my teachers, my masters,

269
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,769
and I swore to myself that
I would become a great man

270
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,372
of pride like them someday!

271
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,441
And you still don't believe
me when I tell you this?

272
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,478
They weren't
captured 50 years ago.

273
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:22,616
That's nothing
but a big fat lie!

274
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,625
Then our bosses
are still out there?

275
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,160
They're still
fighting their duel?

276
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,134
I'm so glad.

277
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,468
They're still okay.

278
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,538
Even after all these years.

279
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,594
Look! We're almost
to the courthouse!

280
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,698
This oughta stop 'em.

281
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,308
We've been hit! No!

282
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:21,842
All right!

283
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,476
We finally got one!

284
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:27,581
Sodom!

285
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,418
No. This is bad!

286
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,720
He needs my help!

287
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:35,122
Grit those teeth
and hold on, Sodom!

288
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,023
You can't fall yet!

289
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,793
Guys, you're gonna have to jump!

290
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,629
Get off him, quick!

291
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,697
Sodom can't go on!

292
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,534
That mortar hit him
square in the chest!

293
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,503
He's about to go down!

294
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,505
You gotta keep moving
no matter what!

295
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,640
You're the only
ones who can do this!

296
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,188
He says "go!"

297
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,470
He's coming down!

298
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:44,791
Nobody's riding it!

299
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,661
Where'd they go?

300
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,463
C'mon.

301
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:55,735
Let's go, Gomorrah!

302
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:01,208
So Robin is in that
building behind you, huh?

303
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,144
Outta my way, bull guy!

304
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,113
Listen boy.

305
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,550
Perhaps you haven't realized
this, but what you're doing

306
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,622
right now is nothing short
of a world-class crime.

307
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,356
Hm?

308
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,602
Just get to the point already.

309
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,340
The power of the World
Government stretches across

310
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,543
more than one hundred
and seventy nations.

311
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:40,047
This island is a symbol
of our strength and resolve.

312
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,150
Attacking it is not simply
an act of rebellion,

313
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:47,554
but a declaration of war against
every country in our alliance.

314
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,724
We are bound by our
honor to strike you down.

315
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,193
You will not only
face a merciless death,

316
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,196
but serve as an example
to the entire world.

317
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,032
You're, at most,
a few dozen men.

318
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,303
You should have thought
this out more carefully.

319
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,672
I said "outta my way."

320
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,307
So you gonna move, or what?

321
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,309
It doesn't matter
if I move or not.

322
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:09,543
The point is that
you condemned yourself

323
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:13,213
to a death sentence the second
you set foot on Enies Lobby.

324
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,648
You understand that?

325
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,417
Fighting is a waste of time.

326
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,553
You got a taste of our
strength at Iceberg's mansion.

327
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,689
You cannot defeat
our Six Powers.

328
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,759
The difference between
us is simply too great.

329
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,397
Yeah, maybe that's true.

330
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,299
But y'know, for some reason,

331
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,135
I have a feeling
I'm gonna win this time!

332
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:40,006
Here we go!

333
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,610
Iron Body.

334
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,744
Gum-Gum Rifle!

335
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,624
This doesn't make any sense!

336
00:20:57,658 --> 00:21:00,594
He wasn't like this at all
when I fought him before!

337
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,230
How is it that he's so
much stronger now?

338
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:06,267
Gatling!

339
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,267
Shave!

340
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,200
I don't care about your honor,

341
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,169
or your Government,
or any of that.

342
00:21:42,202 --> 00:21:44,638
You do what you
want with that crap.

343
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,780
All that matters is
getting Robin out of here!

344
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,629
Gomorrah's down!

345
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:16,563
This is bad.

346
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,066
We've got marines
closing in on all sides!

347
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,467
There's gotta be
like a million-bajillion

348
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,036
of those guys out there!

349
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,738
If we let them surround us,
we'll never break through!

350
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,807
Wait! What is it, Chopper?

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,443
Gomorrah! Gomorrah's
trying to say something!

352
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,312
On the next One Piece:

353
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:34,415
"Don't Stop! Hoist the
Counterattack Signal!"

354
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:36,683
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
