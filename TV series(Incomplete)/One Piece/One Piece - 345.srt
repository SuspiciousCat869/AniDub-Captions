1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,869
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,540
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,545
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,465
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,844
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,263
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,725
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,686
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,564
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,735
You know, I only have
eyes for girls like you.

48
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,821
Or I would, if I had any
eyes in the first place.

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,907
Nyohohohoho!

50
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,408
That said, perhaps
you would like

51
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,618
to show me your panties?

52
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,745
Yeah right!

53
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,496
I know that line.

54
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,541
[NAMI thinking] This can't
just be a coincidence!

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,755
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,633
There's nowhere to run!

57
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,278
[RYUMA] Cindry,
if you would, my dear,

58
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,863
please open that door for me.

59
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,991
And if you have a moment,
I'd like a sandwich as well.

60
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,618
Wait. What happened?

61
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,620
I thought he was
going to cut us.

62
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,955
Yeah, so did I.

63
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,748
He looked really
scary just then.

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,999
Whatever, you guys! Come on!

65
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,918
Let's get out of here
while we still can!

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,628
Look, the door is wide open!

67
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,629
Good point.

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,798
[CHOPPER] Uh, right!

69
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,014
[RYUMA] Three-Verse Humming:
Arrow Notch Slash!

70
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,978
They must've nabbed him

71
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,063
and taken him away
while we weren't looking.

72
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,816
Goodbye Sanji.
Rest in peace.

73
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,984
That ain't cool.

74
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,653
Eh. No biggie. It's Sanji.

75
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,946
I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

76
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,948
Hahahahaha!

77
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,491
Yes, guide them!

78
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,659
Go ahead.

79
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,328
If you want to die so badly,
then challenge our master.

80
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,329
It's your funeral.

81
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,832
He's so frightening,
I can't speak his name.

82
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,585
But here, let me try.
Gecko Mori--ah!

83
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,839
Just as I thought.
It's too scary.

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,007
That's right.

85
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,092
He's one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea, you know!

86
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,844
Those missing friends of yours

87
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,013
are probably dead,
or even worse!

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,890
Consider yourself lucky
that you've lost so few.

89
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,144
I'd save my own skin,
if I were you.

90
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:14,022
If you face Gecko Mori--I mean,

91
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,608
if you face our master,
none of you will survive.

92
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,029
You'd do well to leave
before you incur his wrath!

93
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,032
[LUFFY] Sorry, but I don't
take advice from paintings.

94
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,702
You wanna help, give a message
to that stupid master of yours.

95
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,874
Tell him if he
lays a single finger

96
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,667
on any of my friends.

97
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,755
I'll kick his ass so hard, this
whole island will split in half.

98
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,887
[ABSALOM] Now awaken,
Zombie Generals!

99
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:52,393
[ABSALOM] The fallen warriors
shall pick up their swords anew!

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,083
Zombie Generals!

101
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,461
March forth and teach
them the meaning of fear!

102
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,176
[LUFFY] "A Bunch of Animals?
Perona's Wonder Garden."

103
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,597
[ABSALOM] Hunt them down
wherever they may run

104
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,557
and bring them
before your master!

105
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,852
A few miserable pirates are
no match for your strength!

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,816
Hey, could you pull it
together for once, Captain John?

107
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,901
At least try to live up
to the reputation you had

108
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,944
when you were alive.

109
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,781
Aye aye, sir. On my way.

110
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,950
[ABSALOM] Hmph.
Insufferable lout.

111
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,994
[LOLA] Master Ab.
Let's get married.

112
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,831
[ABSALOM] Lola! Damn it.

113
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,749
Get over there and fight
with the other zombies!

114
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,042
Your commander orders you!

115
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,460
[LOLA] You have
to marry me first.

116
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,753
Hell no!

117
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,258
[LOLA chuckles]

118
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,551
[ABSALOM] Come on now, Lola.

119
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,803
Let's not be rash.

120
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,264
Do as your master commands
and play nice, all right?

121
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,890
Sure, if you marry me.

122
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,643
Are you insane?
I'm a human, you fool!

123
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm marrying another human--
that's the end of it!

124
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,480
Gah!

125
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,692
[ABSALOM] Come on!

126
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,068
Think about this
for a second, Lola.

127
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,278
You're a warthog.

128
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,946
Also you're dead and rotting.

129
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,031
Not exactly a match
made in heaven, here.

130
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,740
[LOLA] Look!

131
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,741
[ABSALOM] Huh?

132
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,996
Whoa! That was close!

133
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,999
Okay! Let's calm down
and stop touching.

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,001
And that's a marriage
certificate, isn't it?

135
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,669
You... You take
that thing back

136
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,504
wherever you got it from!

137
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,884
I don't care what you're saying,
but keep moving those sexy lips!

138
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,762
Kiss me. I love you, baby!

139
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,723
You behave!

140
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,100
I'm not letting some
animal carcass haunt me

141
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,143
the rest of my life!

142
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,188
[LOLA] Bridal Martial Arts!
Marital Vow Kiss!

143
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,028
How about this?
Sweetie Pie Hug!

144
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,615
I love you to death!

145
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,782
Well. You're
already dead,

146
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,659
so that takes care
of that, doesn't it?

147
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,621
I may be dead and
rotting away, Master Ab,

148
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,040
but I swear, my love
is eternal, baby.

149
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,541
Now marry me!

150
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,585
I've told you
a thousand times.

151
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,544
You're a beast!

152
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,254
[LOLA] I'll take that
finger, thank you!

153
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,888
You are not going
anywhere, honey!

154
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,142
Bridal Martial Arts.
Love Sign Attack!

155
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,687
Certificate Seal!

156
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,819
All right, Lola, you have
got to listen this time.

157
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,738
I've already found my bride.

158
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,282
She may have a sharp tongue
and some bothersome friends,

159
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,786
but at the end of the day,
she's human and she's alive,

160
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,246
and that's all
that really matters.

161
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,915
Hahaha! You're just going
to get rejected again.

162
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,124
[ABSALOM] Oh? Look!

163
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,002
She's one of the pirates that's
running amuck on the island.

164
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,713
I'll capture her when we
capture the rest of the crew!

165
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,923
Not if I can help it.

166
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll find her.
And finish her off!

167
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:20,560
[ABSALOM] Ohhh!! No!
Stop ruining my life! Lola!

168
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,440
[FRANKY] I bet that
old guy was right

169
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,859
and Moria's been watching
us this whole time.

170
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,319
We gotta keep our
eyes peeled for traps,

171
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,862
or we'll end up like our cook.

172
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,948
We're already missing
half our damn crew.

173
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,492
Wouldn't surprise me if Moria
was trying to split us up.

174
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,119
[OINKCHUCK chuckles]

175
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,870
Probably just Sanji's fault.

176
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,205
He is pretty dumb.

177
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,957
Still... can't
believe we found

178
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,251
one of the Seven Warlords
of the Sea out here.

179
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,419
My question is:

180
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,005
What're we gonna do if one
of our shadows gets stolen?

181
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,464
Now that would
be interesting.

182
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,092
Well, don't look at me!
I'm not squealing.

183
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,344
I know I promised
that old guy I'd beat up Moria,

184
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
but maybe that should
be second on the list.

185
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,308
Gotta look out
for my crew first.

186
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,268
[chuckles] I can't tell you
where your friends are,

187
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,979
but wherever it is, they're
in for a world of pain.

188
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,397
But I wouldn't
worry about them--

189
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,524
you're not much
better off yourself.

190
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,067
You'll see.

191
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,987
Okay, Wall Pig,
you're gonna stop oinking

192
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,113
and start guiding us.

193
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,531
Got it?

194
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,158
Yes, sir.

195
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,084
Hm? Something wrong?

196
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,587
No. Just my imagination.

197
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,350
[PERONA] Hey, Kumacy? Kumacy!

198
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,893
[KUMACY]
Huh? Hmm?

199
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,186
[PERONA] The Risky Brothers
should be delivering

200
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,063
the coffin as we speak.

201
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,397
Pick it up from them
and take it straight

202
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,566
to our Master over
at the Dance Hall.

203
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,567
Got it?

204
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,363
Did you hear me?
Don't just stare.

205
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,072
[KUMACY] Yes.

206
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,239
Ugh, that's gross!

207
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,200
I told you not to talk!

208
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,410
I'm heading to the Straw Hat's
ship to clean out their treasure

209
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,454
collection while they're
busy with all the zombies.

210
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,456
Let me know if anything
strange happens.

211
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,874
Okeydoke?

212
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,669
There you go.

213
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,380
You're much cuter when you
keep that ugly mouth shut.

214
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,256
[KUMACY] Um.
Take care out there.

215
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,926
[PERONA] Hey! Did you just
mumble something at me?

216
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,470
[KUMACY]
Uhhh.... Ummm...

217
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:26,519
[RISKY BROS.] Heave-ho!
Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

218
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,020
Coming through
with a delivery

219
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,397
for our master!

220
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,648
Yep yep, uh-huh!

221
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,904
Oopsie! We dropped it!

222
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,489
Oh my! That's bad!

223
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,700
Whatever will the Master
think if it's broken?

224
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,534
[creaking wood]

225
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,535
Ahh!

226
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,912
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Oh no, the lid came off!

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,415
[CHOPPER] Huh? What happened?

228
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,541
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Crap! They're awake!

229
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,625
We're screwed! Kill 'em!

230
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,460
Beat 'em to death! Hurry, hurry!

231
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
[RISKY BRO. BROWN HAIR]
Killing is bad.

232
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,588
[RISKY BRO. MASK]
Okay, half kill them half dead!

233
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,059
[CHOPPER] Usopp!
Nami! Guys, we're okay!

234
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,352
Wake up!

235
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,234
But wait.
That guy, he cut us.

236
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,116
[USOPP] He must've used
the back of his sword.

237
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,410
Looks like it rained
while we were knocked out.

238
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,122
The ground's a bit wet.
Where are we?

239
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,457
All I know is
we're outside now,

240
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,292
and those little squirrel
guys dragged us here

241
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,668
in that coffin we were just in.

242
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,420
[USOPP] Holy crap,
it is a coffin!

243
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,005
I didn't notice!

244
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:36,756
Aw turds.

245
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,090
All three of them
are awake now!

246
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,008
Let's book it!

247
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,384
We need backup!

248
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,099
[NAMI] I see.

249
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,100
They brought us to
the back of the mansion.

250
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,519
I think Hogback's lab
was on the top floor,

251
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,271
so they took us pretty far.

252
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,273
It's probably good
we woke up when we did.

253
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,235
[CHOPPER] Look! Behind us!

254
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,155
There's an even bigger
building on the other side!

255
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,993
[USOPP] I wonder what it's for.

256
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,994
Kind of crazy.

257
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,662
That huge building was
here the entire time

258
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,040
and we didn't even notice it.

259
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,333
[NAMI] Usopp! Chopper!

260
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,126
Hmm?

261
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,712
[NAMI] I know exactly
what this place is.

262
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,339
[USOPP]
Oh yeah?

263
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,008
Well, let's hear it then,
'cause I'm lost.

264
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,218
[NAMI] Look.

265
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,637
This is a bridge that connects
one building to the other,

266
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,472
or more like a passageway.

267
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,389
[USOPP] A passageway?

268
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,350
It's kinda wide for that,
don't you think?

269
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,684
There's even a forest.

270
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,394
[USOPP] Well,
it's kind of a forest,

271
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,271
and kind of a
bedroom or something.

272
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,023
But anyway, if they were
dragging us through here

273
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,150
while we were passed out,
then they must've been taking us

274
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,736
to that other building for
some reason or another.

275
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,155
It's probably better
that we don't know.

276
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,032
[NAMI] Don't be a baby.

277
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,410
They were turning us into
zombies and you know it.

278
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,787
[CHOPPER]
Then what're we waiting for?

279
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,871
We gotta get outta here!

280
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,706
[USOPP] Yeah! I'm not
going back in that coffin!

281
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,124
Not so fast, guys.

282
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,376
Huh?

283
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,545
Let's calm down
for a second here.

284
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,088
We were running
scared for so long,

285
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,091
I feel like we're
forgetting something. Think.

286
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,717
I don't want to think,
I want to run!

287
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,719
I know! My "something's
freaky" detector's

288
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,388
detecting something freaky!

289
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,472
[USOPP] Mine too!

290
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,390
Let's get out of here, Nami!

291
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,558
There could be zombies
coming any second!

292
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,810
[thinking] There was something
that Jack-in-a-box said.

293
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,061
What was it?

294
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,234
Sorry suckers, but there's
no treasure in this room!

295
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,403
[USOPP] Whatever it is,
it doesn't matter!

296
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,737
Figure it out later!

297
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,239
[CHOPPER]
C'mon Nami, I'm scared!

298
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,240
I know!

299
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,533
I'm just trying to
come up with a plan here.

300
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,742
I'm as scared as you are!

301
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,245
[USOPP and CHOPPER] That's not
what your eyes are saying!

302
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,788
Then which way are we running?

303
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,748
Forward? Or back?

304
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,458
That's a good question.

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,210
If we head back to the mansion,

306
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,130
we might run into that
zombie samurai again, huh.

307
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,548
[CHOPPER] Yeah, but the
other place might have

308
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,426
even tougher, even scarier guys!

309
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,430
[USOPP] Whoa! Ah! Huh?

310
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,389
I don't think penguins

311
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,100
are normally forest
animals, but whatever.

312
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,352
[PENGUIN ZOMBIE BLONDE]
Count off! One!

313
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,145
Two!

314
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,438
Oh! Three!

315
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,441
[STRAW HATS] Uh. Hm.

316
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,901
Howdy folks, they call us--

317
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,278
The Penguin Zombie Duo!

318
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,571
Wait. That's not right.

319
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,323
Trio! We're a trio!

320
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,115
I'm the new guy!

321
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,576
Who cares?
Not me, that's for sure!

322
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,619
[PENGUIN ZOMBIE BLONDE]
And behind you is

323
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,870
the rest of the crew.

324
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,454
Huh?

325
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,580
[STRAW HATS]
What?

326
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,624
[PENGUIN ZOMBIE BLONDE]
Our friends, the Wild Zombies!

327
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,336
Welcome to Mistress
Perona's Wonder Garden!

328
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,929
Those things
are seriously freaky!

329
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,915
Now, let's beat them
to a bloody pulp!

330
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,212
[NAMI] Chopper!

331
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,422
[CHOPPER] Run!
I'll hold them off!

332
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,590
[NAMI] But where are
we supposed to run to?

333
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,384
There's zombies
all over the place!

334
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,469
[USOPP] Plus, these
guys are wild animals,

335
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,514
so they can probably run
faster than us anyway!

336
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,271
He looks like a human,

337
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,440
but he's really
an animal like us!

338
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,358
How fascinating!

339
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,027
That's right!
I'm a reindeer-- so what?

340
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,654
You must have
Zoan Devil Fruit powers.

341
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,948
We'll cut you some slack
since we're animals, too.

342
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,533
If you get on your
knees and beg for mercy

343
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,201
we'll only bloody
you up a little bit.

344
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,245
You're nuts!
I'm nothing like you!

345
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,956
That so? Then I look
forward to crushing you!

346
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,461
Nami! Get outta here! Hurry!

347
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
Okay!

348
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,179
What's up?
You wanna fight?

349
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,223
Well, bring it
you zebra kangaroo.

350
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,684
Or uh, kangaroo zebra, maybe.

351
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,103
Uh... Which one
do you like better?

352
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,107
Uh... Um.

353
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,443
Lemme warn you about
something before we start.

354
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,111
I'm not just some nobody--

355
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,030
I've won the gold medal
in every single

356
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,491
Pirate Boxing Championship
in the last 50 years!

357
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,955
Okay buddy,
you're asking for it,

358
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,499
just don't come crying to me
when I knock your teeth out!

359
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,753
Eat this!
Phantom Right Punch!

360
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,135
[USOPP] Heh. You'd better
quit while you're ahead.

361
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,184
I'll hunt you down
wherever you go!

362
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,561
You can't hide from
a dog's sense of smell!

363
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,689
Dogs don't talk! No!

364
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,699
[USOPP] Oh no. Hell no.

365
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,042
Yeah! Just like I planned!

366
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,715
[USOPP] Oh no!
Please don't hurt me!

367
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,133
I love animals, I promise!

368
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,095
[Auuuggh!
No no no no no no no!

369
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,678
[NAMI] This way!

370
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,272
[USOPP] That was close.

371
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,484
Nyah Nyah! If you want some,
then come over here and get it!

372
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,902
What's that, you can't?

373
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,238
I gotta keep all
this booty to myself?

374
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,157
And a booty says...

375
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,491
[farts]

376
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,129
Aaaah!!

377
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,630
No, no, stay over there!

378
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,560
[USOPP] Too slow!
Hahahaaha!

379
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,728
How's that?

380
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,564
I'm even better at sniping
than I am at boxing, right?

381
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,317
Hahahahaha!

382
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,334
Damn it. There's too many.

383
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,669
Even if I'm stronger,
I can't keep this up.

384
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,174
[screaming]

385
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:17,758
[CHOPPER] Huh?

386
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,509
Huh?

387
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,472
Usopp! Nami!

388
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,640
Chopper!

389
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,268
[USOPP] I don't know how,
but this is all your fault!

390
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,272
Hurry, Usopp! Fire!

391
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,607
[USOPP] Fire? Huh?

392
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,318
Burn them! These guys
are zombies, too!

393
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,655
Don't let them bite me! Hurry!

394
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:40,656
Nami!

395
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,950
I said get off me! Get away!

396
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,826
My Exploding Star should work!

397
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,204
Zombies hate fire!

398
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,082
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340A] Dude! Fire!

399
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,875
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 340B] Get back,
man, that'll burn you!

400
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,629
I figured it would work,
but I wasn't expecting this.

401
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,466
Eat this, you freaky undead rug!

402
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,425
Huh?

403
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,719
I can't believe you
threw a candle at me!

404
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,722
Seriously--who does that?
Hot, hot, hot!

405
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,432
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 341A] We've
got a fire in the dining room!

406
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,225
The rug-manity!

407
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,893
That guy on the
chandelier did it!

408
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,521
Throw lit candles at him!
See how much he likes it!

409
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,984
[thinking] Oh yeah!
How did I forget that?

410
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,820
Special Attack. Gunpowder Star!

411
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,240
Like that? Then here's another!

412
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,411
[CHOPPER] Are you okay?

413
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,498
Behind you!
Chopper! Look out!

414
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,960
No! Chopper!

415
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,795
Perhaps you should worry less

416
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,673
about your friends and
a bit more about yourself.

417
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,813
[DOGGUIN] Don't you dare!

418
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,902
[ZOMBIE BULLDOG] Hey, stupid!
Who's side are you on, anyway?

419
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,990
[ZOMBIE RAM] I know you're new
here, but that girl's a pirate!

420
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,658
Kick her ass!

421
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,953
[DOGGUIN] I don't care who this
lady is or where she came from.

422
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,957
I don't even care if I have to
disobey our Master's orders.

423
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,711
'Cause even if it kills me,
I'll never kick a woman!

424
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,592
If you got a problem with
that, then bring it on!

425
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,011
You piece of crap zombies.

426
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,777
[LUFFY] Hello? Sanji? Anybody?

427
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,778
Stupid pig!

428
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,863
Just tell us where you
hid our friends already!

429
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,989
C'mon!

430
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,948
Like I said before.

431
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,993
Ask all you like--
I don't know a thing!

432
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,330
When we get our cook back,
we're making bacon out of you.

433
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,415
Perhaps, they were strangled,

434
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,459
and so they can't
call out for help.

435
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,002
No more predictions out of you!

436
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,088
They're way too depressing!

437
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,839
[LUFFY]
Hey, wait a second.

438
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,800
When did we last see Zoro?

439
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,774
[FRANKY] Whoa! What's going on?

440
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,402
We're losing one crew
member after another here!

441
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,028
[ROBIN] They're
vanishing into thin air.

442
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,154
Lost forever.

443
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,073
[LUFFY] Does that
mean we're next?

444
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,867
[ROBIN] So it shall be.
Until no one remains.

445
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,662
[FRANKY] C'mon, this is
creepy enough already!

446
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,913
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

447
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:39,042
"The Vanishing Straw Hat Crew!
A Mysterious Swordsman Appears!"

448
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,378
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
