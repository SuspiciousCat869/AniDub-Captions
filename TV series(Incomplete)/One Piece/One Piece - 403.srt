1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,324
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,660
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,297
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,766
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,068
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

42
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,538
turned to rubber after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,507
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,377
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,078
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,114
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,449
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,420
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,690
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:13,760
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,464
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,136
[NARRATOR] In search of
a ship-coating craftsman

53
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,738
to help them reach Fishman
Island, the Straw Hat crew

54
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,675
landed on the
Sabaody Archipelago.

55
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,343
This mission led
them to Rayleigh,

56
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,078
a craftsman and
former vice-captain

57
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,080
of the Roger Pirates.

58
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,316
On the run from the Navy,
Luffy and the crew

59
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,085
decided to lay low while
Rayleigh modified the Sunny

60
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,687
for underwater travel.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,455
Then, suddenly,
they were ambushed

62
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:46,159
by the Warlord of the Sea,
Bartholomew Kuma.

63
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,265
[ZORO]
Three-Sword Style!

64
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,367
Alright! Now, Gum-Gum!

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,136
How about some Diable!

66
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,305
[SANJI] Mouton!
[LUFFY] Jet!

67
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,107
[ZORO]
600-Caliber!

68
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,842
[ALL yell]

69
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,510
[SANJI yelling]

70
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,545
[ZORO growling]

71
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,480
[LUFFY growling]

72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:13,186
[ALL yelling, grunting]

73
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,864
[NARRATOR] But Zoro wondered
if this was the real Kuma.

74
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,500
[SANJI]
Well, he's plenty strong as-is.

75
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,901
And what's worse...

76
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,872
The real one might
be after us as well.

77
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,742
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, several
of the Supernovas squared off

78
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,243
against Admiral Kizaru,

79
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,646
an assassin sent by
Navy Headquarters.

80
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,498
[KIZARU]
This is Borsalino.

81
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,732
[SENTOMARU]
What the heck, Uncle?

82
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,368
You do have a baby
transponder snail!

83
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,370
Why didn't you contact me?

84
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,607
[KIZARU]
Huh? Oh! Is that you, Sentomaru!

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,942
[SENTOMARU] Don't give me
that "Is that you" business!

86
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,278
Where are you?
What are you doing?

87
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,846
I tried contacting you before,

88
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,782
but I couldn't get
a hold of you.

89
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,251
[SENTOMARU]
Ugh, It's fine, forget it.

90
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,752
It's time we get to work now.

91
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,322
It seems the culprits
have split up.

92
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,326
Straw Hat Luffy, Captain
Eustass Kid, and Trafalgar Law.

93
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,560
Which one do we start with?

94
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,564
Huh. Split up.
In that case, well...

95
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,667
[ZORO grunting]

96
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,538
[ZORO groans]

97
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,676
[SANJI] This bastard wants
us dead, but if he's not

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,878
Bartholomew Kuma,
who the hell is he?

99
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,348
Either way, we don't
have time for this crap.

100
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,683
If we don't get out of here,
we're gonna be even

101
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,552
worse off than we are now.

102
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,290
[LUFFY]
An Even Stronger Enemy Appears!

103
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,792
The Battle
Axe-Carrying Sentomaru.

104
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,442
Listen, Trafalgar.
You're in my damn way.

105
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,513
Now get outta here. I've got
this. I'm takin' him down.

106
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,483
Ya got it backwards.
You're in my way.

107
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,884
Now run along.

108
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,461
[LAW]
Room!

109
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,508
Nothin' but laser beams.

110
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,676
I expected more from
a Warlord of the Sea.

111
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,944
[MARINE 403A]
There they are!

112
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,281

Heart Pirates and Eustass Kid,

captain of the Kid Pirates!

114
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,850
Don't let 'em escape!

[MARINES]
Yes, sir!

116
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,821
Crap! We got a whole mess
of marines comin' up on us!

117
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:02,989
We're boxed in!

118
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,892
If this situation can get
any worse, I don't know how!

119
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,694
Quick. Come with me, Bepo!
We're bustin' through!

120
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,996
Hey, you're the new guy!

121
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,898
You can't just go
givin' me orders!

took all the fun for himself.

Repel!

129
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,941
Something's wrong. He can't
be Bartholomew Kuma.

130
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,709
That guy ain't no Warlord.

Hey, you don't need
to punch so hard!

154
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,077

Good luck dodging this!
I dare say, you're in for it!

Wait.

[BROOK screams]
I'm stuck!

161
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,029
That was not my plan!

162
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,866
Hold on! No! Please, sir!
Let's be reasonable about this!

163
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,836
I'd rather you not
kill me right now!

164
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,739
Although, you know,
I am already dead, but,

165
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,075
I feel like that's
beside the point!

Huh? Hey, check
it out. He's down.

[USOPP panting]
What the--

174
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:40,264
Wait, so explosives work
on him all of a sudden?

175
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:45,169
[FRANKY panting] You sank
one of 'em into his mouth.

176
00:10:45,202 --> 00:10:48,472
It must've shorted out
something inside of him.

His body may be hard as steel,
but his skin still bleeds.

178
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,611
[FRANKY]
He's just like me.

179
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:56,113
He's got a normal
old human body,

180
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,650
but it's been modified and
stuffed full of weapons.

181
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:02,386
[NAMI panting]

182
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,458
[NAMI panting]

183
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,561
Nami, look out!
He's got a lock on you!

184
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,432
Holy crap!

185
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,602
[ROBIN]
Ochenta Fleurs! Cuatro Mano!

186
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,770
And Shock!

187
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,708
Nice one!

188
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,277
Who needs to fight when we can
just make him blow himself up?

189
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,112
We shoulda thought
of this before!

190
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,454
[NAMI] Hey. You might
wanna sit somewhere else.

191
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,056
That spot is under
a storm warning.

192
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:43,260
[NAMI] From the dark clouds
to my Clima Takt.

193
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,330
Thunderbolt Tempo!

194
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:01,078
[BROOK]
So, did it work, or not?

195
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:06,283
[ALL scream]

196
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,721
That attack didn't
slow him down at all!

197
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:13,124
The only thing it
did is piss him off!

198
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:25,102
[CHOPPER] What's he aiming at?
He's firing everywhere!

199
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,605
[FRANKY]
He looks desperate to me.

200
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:30,608
Desperate? He's lost
his damn mind!

201
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:37,181
Desperation's the same

202
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,316
as admitting you've
lost the fight.

203
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:44,655
[ZORO]
Hey, knock his ass over here.

204
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:47,458
[SANJI] Gotta have a
piece of the action, huh?

205
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,326
[SANJI]
Diable Jambe!

206
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,529
Flambe Shot!

207
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,636
[FRANKY pants]
Nice!

208
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:01,572
We're finally starting
to wear him down!

209
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,307
[ZORO]
Demon Aura.

210
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,476
Nine-Sword Style.

211
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:07,211
Asura!

212
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,547
What? Is my vision blurred?

213
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,182
So many Zoros!

214
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,619
[ZORO]
Nine Lightning Strikes!

215
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,864
[LUFFY]
Third, Gear!

216
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,899
Here goes!

217
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,335
Luffy! Smash him!

218
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:33,370
[FRANKY]
Just one last push!

219
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,873
And Gum-Gum...

220
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:41,278
[BOTH]
Luffy! Go!

221
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,683
Giant Rifle!

222
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:22,753
I'm shrinking!

223
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:26,957
[LUFFY screaming]

224
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:46,677
[panting]

225
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:57,421
[panting]

226
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,490
That do it? Is he done?

227
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,525
[USOPP]
Seems like it.

228
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,493
About time.

229
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:07,531
[NAMI panting]
Jeez. He looks fine. Creepy.

230
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:12,903
[USOPP panting] If he's fine,
then we are screwed.

231
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,605
I'm too tired to move anymore.

232
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:18,342
You know, maybe we should've
run instead of fighting.

233
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,510
[ROBIN]
No.

234
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,079
It's best to take them on
as they come, one at a time.

235
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,748
We're being chased.
We can't get cornered.

236
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:27,985
[ZORO]
True. But still, he wasn't Kuma.

237
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:28,919
Who was he?

238
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,355
We know he's a cyborg,
so he must've been

239
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,856
a person at some point.

240
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,060
But, if this guy isn't the
real Bartholomew Kuma,

241
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:39,029
then why the heck does
he look just like him?

242
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,898
[FRANKY]
Maybe the guy's got a twin?

243
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,534
If not, they must've
modified the crap out of him

244
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,905
to make them look the same.
Can't imagine why, though.

245
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,974
He couldn't have been
created from scratch.

246
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,543
You can't do that
with a living person.

247
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:58,115
[SANJI]
PX-4? Huh.

248
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,851
[LUFFY sighs]
We need to get some rest.

249
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:04,455
I was up for a fight, but that
guy was way too much for me.

250
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:05,823
I'm exhausted.

251
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:08,726
[SANJI] A break would be nice,
but we've gotta find

252
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,461
a place to hide first.

253
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:14,398
If they find us now, there's
no way we can fight 'em off.

254
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,100
Yeah, I know.

255
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:22,473
But, let's just sit here
for a few minutes.

256
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:24,408
[SENTOMARU]
You guys got some real nerve!

257
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,576
Look what you've done!

258
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,143
Huh?

259
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:27,177
[ALL gasp]

260
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,446
[USOPP] What the--
Another enemy! Where is he?

261
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:32,750
[CHOPPER]
There he is! Up there!

262
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,917
[BOTH gasp]

263
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,853
[SENTOMARU]
Hoisa!

264
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,828
Who are you?

265
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:48,866
[SENTOMARU] I'm disgusted.
You're an utter disgrace, PX-4.

266
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,901
The Navy's not made of money!

267
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,103
Building just one
of you Pacifistas costs

268
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,439
as much as an entire warship.

269
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,807
[ALL gasp]

270
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,775
[SENTOMARU]
Seriously.

271
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,977
You know how this is
gonna look in my report

272
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,413
to that lousy Vegapunk?

273
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:14,825
[ALL scream]

274
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,827
[CHOPPER] He's got
another Warlord with him!

275
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,129
You've gotta be kidding me!
Is that the real one?

276
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,799
Does it really matter
if it's the real one or not?

277
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,501
We've already gotten a taste
of how strong the fakes are.

278
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:27,004
We can't take another
fight. Not with him.

279
00:17:27,037 --> 00:17:30,140
Wait. Pacifista?

280
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,775
[NAMI]
Yeah, that's what he called him.

281
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,178
He didn't seem like much
of a pacifist though.

282
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,914
So, you think that's
his name or something?

283
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,450
Alright, axe boy, just
who the hell are ya?

284
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,086
[SENTOMARU] I've got an identity
outside of my axe, you know.

285
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,154
And there's no point
asking questions.

286
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,090
I have no reason to answer you.

287
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:48,992
I am the most well-guarded
and tight-lipped man alive.

288
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,629
Nobody can break down
my impenetrable defenses.

289
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:55,599
[USOPP] Oh, c'mon! You could
at least tell us your name!

290
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:58,469
[SENTOMARU] Did you hear
a single thing I just told you?

291
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,571
My lips are sealed. Trust me.

292
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:02,973
There's not one person
more secretive than me,

293
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,842
Sentomaru.

294
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,244
Gotcha. So you're Sentomaru.

295
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:11,014
Uh, to be clear, I
wanted you to know that,

296
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,483
that's why I told you.

297
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:15,519
And not because you
wanted to know, okay?

298
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,889
PX-1. Let's get started.

299
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:28,532
[ALL scream]

300
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,269
[SANJI]
Still no paw bubbles.

301
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,671
This guy shoots beams
from his hands too.

302
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:37,107
Starting to look like they've
got a whole army of these guys.

303
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,642
What is this crap?

304
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:40,644
I'm more concerned
with staying alive.

305
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:42,546
The mystery can wait.

306
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,581
We're too worn down.

307
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:47,084
There's just no way we can
make it through another fight.

308
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:49,653
And we haven't even
met the admiral.

309
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,188
[LUFFY panting]
Yeah.

310
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:59,229
We can't win. Let's run,
but not all together.

311
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,807
We need to split up!

312
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,242
[USOPP whimpering]

313
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,285
[CHOPPER, USOPP]
Sounds good to me! Run!

314
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,888
We're the toughest.
We'll each lead our own group.

315
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,590
Right. Are you gonna
be okay on your own?

316
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,992
[ZORO]
Hey, shut up.

317
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,928
[SANJI] Wait up, Nami!
We should stick together!

318
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,663
I'll protect you no matter what!

319
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,965
Even if it means
sacrificing my life!

320
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,701
[NAMI]
Fine! Thanks! Now run, faster!

321
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,904
If you're really willing
to sacrifice yourself,

322
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,273
why don't you hang back
and act as a decoy?

323
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,308
[SANJI]
It's a ladies only offer, idiot.

324
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,612
You can take care of your
own damn self, panty man.

325
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,947
[USOPP yelps]

326
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,416
[USOPP screaming]

327
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,919
Zoro! Don't let me die!

328
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,388
Protect me with all
your might, okay?

329
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,457
[ZORO] Usopp! I'm already
in enough pain as it is!

330
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,559
[BROOK]
Fret not, my friend!

331
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,328
I'll proudly supply the
strength you currently lack!

332
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,298
I can only imagine how much
healing you've left to do.

333
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,867
I happened to witness your
act of selfless bravery

334
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,036
on Thriller Bark when
you offered your own life

335
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,971
in place of Luffy's.

336
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,907
All right. Thanks.

337
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,410
[LUFFY] Up there! Head that way!
[ROBIN] Got it.

338
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,878
[CHOPPER]
No more laser beams!

339
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,446
Hey! Guys!

340
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,615
Meet back on the
Sunny in three days!

341
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,883
[SENTOMARU]
They're splitting into groups!

342
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,585
Go after them, PX-1!

343
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,920
Make sure you don't let
'em out of Grove 12.

344
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,922
We don't need that headache.

345
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,090
[USOPP]
Special Attack,

346
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,959
Super Smoke Star!

347
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,431
Now's our chance, run for it!

348
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,466
[BROOK]
You really are quite dependable!

349
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,635
[ALL gasp]

350
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,004
[SANJI]
Crap! He took out the bridge!

351
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,439
Here he comes!

352
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,609
[NAMI]
No! Why's he after us?

353
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,578
[FRANKY] Look, I don't know,
but will you quit pushing me?

354
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,547
[FRANKY]
Cut it out!

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,849
He's over there!
Are you guys okay?

356
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,886
I'd worry about
myself if I were you.

357
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,390
I've got no grudge against you
pirates, but a job is a job.

358
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,892
Now Gum-Gum...

359
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,929
Gatling!

360
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,764
[SENTOMARU]
Hoisa!

361
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,732
What the--?

362
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,834
What? How'd he even do that?

363
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,370
[SENTOMARU] Your offensive
skills are impressive.

364
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,373
But they're useless
against my defense!

365
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,509
Ashigara Dokkoi Shove!

366
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,510
Luffy!

367
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,979
Oh boy. This guy is strong!

368
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,614
[SENTOMARU]
Just so you know.

369
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,117
I don't even have
Devil Fruit powers.

370
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,853
[LUFFY groans]
That makes it worse.

371
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:28,787
Man, this is weird.

372
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,824
[ZORO panting]

373
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,594
[USOPP groans]
Thanks for the warning!

374
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,996
I thought you were supposed
to be protecting me, you jerk!

375
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,464
[ZORO]
Get back!

376
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,832
[BROOK gasps]

377
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:45,771
[USOPP]
Zoro!

378
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,738
[LUFFY gasps]

379
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,874
[USOPP screams]

380
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,811
[ZORO groans]

381
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,647
[BROOK, USOPP gasp]

382
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,684
[USOPP] Who-Who are
you? Or what are you?

383
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,953
Whatever! Just get the
hell away from Zoro!

384
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,789
[BROOK]
Oh, no, no, Zoro!

385
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,825
He got hit by one
of those laser beams!

386
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,828
[USOPP]
Hang in there, buddy! Come on!

387
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,030
[SENTOMARU]
It's about time you got here.

388
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,600
Took you long enough.
Uncle Kizaru.

389
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,036
Kizaru? Hey, Usopp! Be careful!

390
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,172
That man's a Navy admiral!

391
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,108
An admiral? Uh-oh!

392
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,643
[ZORO grunting]

393
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,946
[KIZARU] Your time is up,
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

394
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,216
Last I checked, you had
a 120 million bounty.

395
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,819
So, this is not
what I was expecting.

396
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,689
Your reputation as a swordsman
is known far and wide.

397
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,993
But one hit and you're down?
That's a real shame, ain't it?

398
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,897
You must be pretty
worn out, hm?

399
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,135
[ZORO]
Damn. The admiral found us.

400
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:53,705
[KIZARU] Well, you'll have
plenty of time to rest up now.

401
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,977
Zoro!

402
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,661
[NAMI] A Warlord, that
weirdo with the big axe

403
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,729
and now an Admiral, too?

404
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:20,198
[KIZARU] I know you're
having a real tough time,

405
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,968
but what can I say?
I'm good at my job.

406
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,870
[LUFFY] I hate to
admit it, but these guys

407
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,172
are too strong for us.
Everyone, run for it!

408
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,774
Just don't die!

409
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,275
On the next One Piece.

410
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,744
"Admiral Kizaru's
Fierce Assault--

411
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,013
The Straw Hats
Face Certain Death!"

412
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,182
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
