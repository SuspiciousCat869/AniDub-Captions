1
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,383
[NARRATOR] Luffy
accepted a challenge

2
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,052
from the Foxy Pirates
and wagered

3
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,720
his own crewmates in
a "Davy Back Fight."

4
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,427
[NARRATOR] However,
thanks to Foxy's trickery,

5
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,729
the Straw Hats lost the
first round, the Donut Race.

6
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,501
[FOXY] My first selection
is none other than...

7
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,738
...you! The doctor!
Tony Tony Chopper!

8
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,506
Boil me or cook me alive!

9
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,741
Give me your worst,
you bastards!

10
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:26,313
[NARRATOR] Now, an
unlikely duo must win

11
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,250
the second round, the Groggy
Ring, to get Chopper back.

12
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,052
Disappointed?

13
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,186
Not at all.

14
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,498
[CHIRP CHIRP]
Chirp, chirp!

15
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,367
[ITOMIMIZU] Our mighty
Groggy Ring combatants

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,635
have taken the field!

17
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,170
Opposing them, on
the Straw Hat's team.

18
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,140
Their meddlesome sidelined
supporter from the first round.

19
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,409
The savage chef Sanji!

20
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,411
I think you mean "stylish chef."

21
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,679
Puh-puh-puh...

22
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,348
[ITOMIMIZU] And beside him, with
a bounty of 60 million berries,

23
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:05,219
Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro!

24
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,453
[PICKLES] Hardly
worth our time to squash

25
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:11,491
a couple of pipsqueaks like
these! Hehehe. Right, Big Pan?

26
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,061
Huh?

27
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,729
Puh-puh-puh...

28
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,830
He can't hear you.

29
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,399
Man, what do these guys eat?

30
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,767
[REFEREE] We'll start
this out with a coin toss.

31
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,704
Tails.

32
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,172
What about you?

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,707
[SANJI] Uhh... Kind of
has to be heads, right?

34
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,279
[REFEREE] Tails.
Hehehe...

35
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,648
[REFEREE]
Field or ball?

36
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,749
Ball please.

37
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,716
[ITOMIMIZU]
You heard them!

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,753
Our Groggy Monsters
have chosen the ball!

39
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,122
The Straw Hat's ball
man will now enter

40
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,691
the other team's mid circle!

41
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,558
[REFEREE]
Left or right?

42
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,492
[ZORO]
Doesn't matter.

43
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,627
[ITOMIMIZU] In case
you were wondering,

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,594
the ball men
are the players

45
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,296
with the silly little
hats on their heads.

46
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,231
Knock your opponent's
ball man into the ring

47
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,334
on their side of the field
and the game is yours!

48
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,101
[RANDOM FOXY C]
Just get on with it!

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,539
Hey ball man get
in position already!

50
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,276
Now listen. I never agreed to
be the ball in the first place.

51
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,143
You better shut your mouth

52
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,679
unless you want a
boot to the teeth.

53
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,148
How am I supposed to look cool
with this thing on my head?!

54
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,116
You gonna cry over a hat?

55
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,154
Hey! That looks good on you!

56
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,823
You think I'm gonna
fall for that, stupid?!

57
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,660
Zoro! Sanji!
I'm counting on you!

58
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,162
I'm sorry we lost the
last round, you guys!

59
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,430
It's up to you now!

60
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,133
Please get Chopper
back! You gotta!

61
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,236
Wow, would you look at
that! It's a real Wotan!

62
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,305
They aren't as large
as pureblooded giants

63
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,473
but he's still pretty big.

64
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,075
Feh-feh-feh!

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,279
Don't bother cheering for
your friends it's no use!

66
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,347
Those guys are more
than just muscle

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,549
they're Groggy Ring experts!

68
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,285
Oh, hey Split Head.
Did you want something?

69
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,290
He said it again.

70
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,059
Aw, Poor Boss!

71
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,295
[PORCHE] Why would you be so
cruel to this sweet, gentle man?

72
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,598
What's with that face?

73
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,300
If you're afraid
I'm gonna interfere again,

74
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,301
then don't worry!

75
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:03,671
I won't even need to in
this round! You babies!

76
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:06,240
Don't tell me you can
butt in on this game, too?!

77
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,143
Yep! It all depends on
how the captain feels!

78
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,111
Naturally some
pirates like to fight fair

79
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,414
and square so they can test
the strength of their crew.

80
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,082
Others will cheat
any way they can

81
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,784
to make sure they
never lose a match.

82
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,686
But I just do
whatever I want!

83
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,355
Feh-feh-feh!

84
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,790
I don't see why
you're complaining

85
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,525
about a little foul
play here and there.

86
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,659
If you're a real pirate,

87
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:29,129
you should be used to
these sorts of things, right?

88
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,497
The sea is treacherous.

89
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,700
Oh yeah. You would know.

90
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,400
[ZORO and SANJI] Three.

91
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,201
By the way,
your team looks

92
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,303
to be playing a
game of their own.

93
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,370
[ZORO and SANJI] Three.

94
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,373
They do know the match
is about to start, right?

95
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,174
[ZORO and SANJI] Three.

96
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,308
[NAMI]
Laugh while you still can!

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,577
They're just laid back,
'cause they know they can win!

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,045
I saw that, cheater!

99
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,747
You went too early
on that last one!

100
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,750
Shut up! You're just
mad 'cause you lost.

101
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,118
Like you always do.

102
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,287
What?! I always lose, huh?!

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,122
We'll just see about that!

104
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:56,590
Let's do best three out of five!

105
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,491
You'll just lose again.

106
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,327
So is the chef your
ball man, or what?

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,561
Hurry up!

108
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,698
[NAMI thinking] Is that what
those idiots are arguing about?

109
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,468
Sanji! That hat
looks great on you!

110
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,570
All right! Let's rock!

111
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,372
Ball Man's here
to kick some ass!

112
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,641
Gotta admit,
it does suit you.

113
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,076
You look like
a real prince.

114
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,346
From the kingdom
of lameasses.

115
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,321
You're wasting time!
Start the match!

116
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:27,921
[SANJI]
You suck.

117
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:28,522
[ZORO]
No, you suck.

118
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:28,956
[SANJI]
No, you suck.

119
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:29,690
Hey, hold it!

120
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,324
No weapons on
the field, pal!

121
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,093
You gotta lose the swords!

122
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,495
Huh? Those the rules?

123
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,398
Yep! 'Cause this
is a ball game!

124
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,734
Can't have you slicing
each other up, now can we?

125
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:45,439
Fine! My fists
are all I need!

126
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,408
[SANJI] You sure you're
gonna be okay out there?

127
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,210
A swordsman without
his swords is just, well...

128
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,713
[ZORO]
What?

129
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,615
A normal guy. Only lamer.

130
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:05,292
That wasn't even a
good burn! Get over it!

131
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,727
[ITOMIMIZU] It certainly
took long enough,

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,662
but it looks like the
Straw Hat's Ball Man

133
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,532
is finally making his way
to the opponent's circle!

134
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,534
[ZORO] Hey cook, I hope
you get trampled out there.

135
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,235
[SANJI]
Up yours.

136
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,438
[CROWD cheers]

137
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,673
[ITOMIMIZU] The crowd
is hungry for action today!

138
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,376
Big Pan, are you ready to
make some grown men cry?

139
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,380
Huh?

140
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:30,584
Puh-puh-puh!
He can't hear you!

141
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,588
Eh... Heh heh heh...

142
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,691
Come on, man!
Hahahaha!

143
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,361
Pay attention for once!

144
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:41,494
Huh?

145
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,502
It's not that funny,
stop laughing!

146
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,603
[ITOMIMIZU]
What can I say?

147
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,473
The Groggy Monsters are
always up for a good laugh!

148
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:56,043
Now why don't we go
over a few quick rules?

149
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:59,379
There's no time limit, and
the first team to score wins!

150
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,516
[ZORO thinking] So all we gotta
do to win is knock jumbo's head

151
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,119
into the ring on
their side. Simple enough.

152
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,421
Hahahahaha!

153
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,659
[ZORO thinking] Hard part
is gonna be stopping them

154
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,794
from planting the
cook's head in our ring.

155
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,330
[swallows]

156
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,833
[ITOMIMIZU] Can
Team Straw Hat win back

157
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,302
the reindeer they
lost in Round 1,

158
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,737
or will they lose
another member?!

159
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,573
As you can see,
Foxy's returning champs

160
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,309
are laughing in the
face of their competition.

161
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:31,045
But will they be the
ones to laugh last?

162
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,513
The whistle is
about to sound!

163
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,755
[whistle]

164
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,425
[ITOMIMIZU]
Let the game begin!

165
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:48,162
We start with Ball Man
Sanji deep in enemy territory!

166
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,763
Will he retreat or attack?!

167
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,132
Let's do this!

168
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,801
[ITOMIMIZU] Tackle
Machine Pickles takes off

169
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,536
with a heavy charge!

170
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,806
Okay, just gotta head for their
ball man and finish them off.

171
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,774
Sling Tackle!

172
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,776
Get outta my way!

173
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,745
Let's see what
you got, big man.

00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,350
[SANJI thinking] If I attack
him where his skin's exposed

345
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,486
I'll just end up slipping
around like last time.

346
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,290
That leaves his hands, his feet,
his mask, and his underwear.

347
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,692
Loach Scooping Slide!

348
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,264
Loach Racing Circus!

349
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:16,337
Uh-oh! Here comes
Big Pan's signature move!

350
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,639
Things are about
to get slippery!

351
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:22,776
Ha! Bring it on! Who's afraid
of a little skating, right?

352
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,278
[ITOMIMIZU]
Now, there's no escape!

353
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,579
[SANJI]
I'm gonna lose my lunch!

354
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,616
C'mon! Pull it
together guys! Really!

355
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,417
[ITOMIMIZU] It looks
like Pickles and Hamburg

356
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,720
have finally recovered
from their earlier accident!

357
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,221
[RANDOM FOXY D]
Yeah! They're back in it!

358
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,056
[RANDOM FOXY E]
Slaughter them, guys!

359
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,057
[ITOMIMIZU]
And what's this?

360
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,393
It seems that they've
updated their wardrobe!

361
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,428
Their leader Hamburg is
sporting some iron knuckles

362
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,398
and elbow guards!
Where did those come from?

363
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,434
Meanwhile, Pickles has donned
spiked shoulder protectors!

364
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,237
Those clearly violate
the "no weapons" rule!

365
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,672
But by complete coincidence,

366
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,441
the referee seems to be doing
some stretches right now.

367
00:17:54,474 --> 00:18:00,114
Oh well, you can't expect him
to catch everything, right?

368
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,116
Time for revenge
my friend. You ready?

369
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:09,122
Here goes! Loach Coaster!

370
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:12,493
Won't stop spinning.

371
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,694
Now we'll bring the pain!

372
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:16,430
Let's do it!

373
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,666
Spinning Tackle!

374
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,234
[ITOMIMIZU] The Groggy Monsters
launch a counter attack!

375
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,802
But this time, their
target isn't the ball man,

376
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:25,139
but his partner, Zoro!
This is about to get ugly!

377
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,107
Hamburger Hammer!

00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,679

00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,148
No! Zoro!

00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,050
[ITOMIMIZU] But the
assault isn't over yet!

381
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,719
Big Pan readies yet
another brutal attack!

382
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:41,088
Hamburg is brandishing
his mighty elbow guards

383
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,524
and preparing for an
air-to-ground strike!

384
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,391
Oh no.

385
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,659
This is bad.

386
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,827
[ITOMIMIZU]
The Straw Hats are about

387
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,229
to learn the
power of teamwork!

388
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,365
[pained grunting]

389
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:55,169
[ITOMIMIZU] Like an
arrow raining from the sky.

390
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,436
Hmm? Ahh!

391
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,705
[BIG PAN]
Punk Attack!

No!

395
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,089
[ITOMIMIZU]
A direct hit!

396
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:17,157
He won't be
walking that one off!

397
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,226
By the way, fatalities
are a common occurrence

398
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,362
in the Groggy Ring,
in case you didn't know.

399

[SANJI]
So dizzy.

400
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,764
[ITOMIMIZU] And now
the Foxy Team turns

401
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,500
their attention to the
Straw Hat's ball man!

402
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,704
Human... Cannon!

403
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,208
[ITOMIMIZU] Pickles and
his spikes are closing in fast!

404
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,810
Sanji! Move!

[ITOMIMIZU] What,
you thought that was it?

00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:45,352
They're just getting started!

[HAMBURG]

410
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,491
[ITOMIMIZU] Hamburg
sends him flying back!

411
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,127
They don't even care
about scoring anymore!

Get up, Zoro! C'mon Sanji!

420
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:02,263
[ITOMIMIZU] Both balls
are still in play,

00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:05,432
but it looks like Team Straw
Hat is down for the count!

[ITOMIMIZU] In fact, you
might say they're "Groggy"!

424
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,540
Now all that's left is to stuff

425
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,243
the ball man in his
coffin, I mean, goal

426
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,480
and it'll be two wins in
a row for the Foxy Pirates!

427
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:23,617
It just goes to show, you
can't keep a good monster down!
