00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,800
we'd go out of business!

177
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,302
[SANJI]
Are you really this stupid?!

178
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,237
Just how is my
soup any different

179
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,139
from the stuff you make? How?!

180
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,308
You think they're the same?

181
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,110
[SANJI grunting]

182
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,914
[ZEFF growls]
Don't flatter yourself!

183
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,148
[COOKS gasp]

184
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,783
[PATTY]
The Boss punched him!

185
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,285
[CARNE]
He didn't kick him!

186
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,320
[grunts]

187
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,390
You think you can lecture me
on the art of cooking, do ya?

188
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,291
Fat chance!

189
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,793
I'm a man who has
cooked on more seas

190
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,762
than days that
you've been alive!

191
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,130
[SANJI grunts]

192
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,002
[growls]

193
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,774
[SANJI]
Damn it!

194
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,114
[SANJI]
That worthless old man...

195
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,787
[SANJI]
I'm not a little brat, anymore!

196
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,459
[LUFFY slurps]

197
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,995
Gah! What's all the fuss about?

198
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,164
This soup's totally awesome!

199
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,865
All of us know the soup is good.

200
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:00,600
[LUFFY]
Huh?

201
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,835
I know he's an outstanding chef.

202
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,338
Everyone here on
the Baratie does.

203
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,039
Yeah, he's great.

204
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,842
Aside from Chef Zeff,
he's the best we got.

205
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,210
[COOK D]
That was scary wasn't it?

206
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,878
He seriously snapped.

207
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,180
[COOK O]
Yeah...

208
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,387
[ZEFF] But that
thick skulled idiot

209
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,724
wouldn't listen to us if
we tried to reason with him.

210
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,126
[growls]

211
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,227
Hey, listen.

212
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,328
[LUFFY]
Hm?

213
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,863
[ZEFF] You were saying
that you needed

214
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,865
a cook for your ship, right?

215
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,801
Well, this isn't something I
want to be asking anyone,

216
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,072
but... would you mind taking
that little brat along with you?

217
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,974
Take him to the Grand Line.

218
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,142
[LUFFY]
Hm?

219
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,344
That would be best for him.

220
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,080
The Grand Line is his dream.

221
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:52,985
Geez, Boss, you sure made
us put on a hell of a show.

222
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,421
Oh man, I was worried he
was gonna figure it out

223
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,056
'cause of your bad acting!

224
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,324
[laughing]

225
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,826
C'mon, Your acting was
way worse than mine!

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,495
[COOK D] I'm gonna get
some more of that soup!

227
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,897
[COOK O]
Yeah, that stuff is good!

228
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:19,111
[SANJI grumbles]

229
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:25,851
[SANJI] I can hear
everything, Dumbasses.

230
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,070
[ZEFF]
So, what do you say, Kid?

231
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,471
No way.

232
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,610
But earlier, you mentioned you
needed a cook for your ship.

233
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,112
Just what are you trying to say?

234
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,881
That he's suddenly not
good enough for ya'?

235
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,049
Oh, he's good.

236
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,886
And I'd love it if he joined
my crew and came with us.

237
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,122
But, it seems like he
really wants to stay here

238
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,390
and cook with all of you guys.

239
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,594
You can ask me all you want,
but I'm just not gonna take him.

240
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,763
So you're saying you
can't agree to it

241
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,566
until he tells you
himself, s'that right?

242
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,434
That's right! More food, please!

243
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,137
Well, I suppose
that's fair enough.

244
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,606
But, who knows if that
hardheaded little brat

245
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,942
will ever agree to
join up with you.

246
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,478
[PATTY] Yeah, Once that
guy makes up his mind,

247
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,947
there's nothin' anybody
can do to change it.

248
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,582
[LUFFY]
More, please!

249
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,661
[gasps]

250
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,531
[YOSAKU screams]

251
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,969
[screaming continues]

252
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,471
[SANJI yells]

253
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,148
[SANJI grunts]

254
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:02,982
Sanji!

255
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,117
What is that? A fishman?

256
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,119
[COOK D] Did he come all the
way from the Fishman Islands

257
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,487
‐‐to eat here?
‐‐ [COOK E] You dolt!

258
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,489
It's a human and a panshark!

259
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,991
[LUFFY]
Huh? What's this?

260
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,726
Whoa! It's Yosaku!

261
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,529
Oh, hey... Big Bro Luffy.

262
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,230
How come you're alone?
Where are the others?

263
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,900
‐‐Did you find Nami?
‐‐[YOSAKU groans]

264
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,008
[YOSAKU] We never
actually caught up to her,

265
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,843
but, from the direction
Big Sis is headed,

266
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,578
we think we've figured
out where she's going

267
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,013
and what she plans to do.

268
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,683
[LUFFY] I see.... Then we
can bring her back.

269
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,685
Maybe... It's just...

270
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,587
IF our suspicions
turn out to be true,

271
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,923
then the place she intends to
go could mean certain death

272
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,025
for all of us, if we follow her.

273
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,326
[LUFFY grunts]

274
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,095
[YOSAKU] The point is, we really
need your help, Big Bro Luffy.

275
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,831
Please! Come with me!

276
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,033
Okay... I don't really get it,

277
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,168
but I got it. Let's go.

278
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,545
[SANJI]
Wait.

279
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,047
Your dream is foolish.

280
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,583
Then again, so's mine.

281
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,054
Now is as good a time as any.

282
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,257
Why not start my
quest, right now?

283
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,793
[LUFFY]
Sanji...

284
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,695
I'll be joining
your little crew,

285
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,231
on your journey to be
King of the Pirates.

286
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,566
[gasps]

287
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,634
[SANJI]
You hear me?

288
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,936
I want to be the
cook on your ship.

289
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,705
[PATTY, CARNE]
Huh?

290
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,244
All right, whadya' say?

291
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,645
Yeah!

292
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,946
Of course!

293
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,915
[YOSAKU]
This is great, Big Bro Luffy!

294
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,049
[BOTH]
Woo hoo!

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:44,950
We got a cook!

296
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,252
Now we'll get the tasty food!

297
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,920
We got a cook!

298
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,723
[SANJI] Are you guys
happy now, or what?

299
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,325
Sorry. Really, I'll leave now.

300
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,261
Ha! I don't like it!

301
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,061
To tell ya' the truth,

302
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,763
I was hopin' to
give you the boot

303
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,265
from this restaurant personally.

304
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,100
But, it seems that you
don't have a problem

305
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,636
with straight up abandoning us.

306
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,737
I'm especially sorry

307
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,640
for making the lot of
you resort to bad acting.

308
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,675
Hey, wait! How'd you know?

309
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,776
[SANJI]
I heard everything!

310
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,144
You bunch of jerks!

311
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,612
What?!

312
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,947
Was stomping on my pride

313
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,815
the best plan that you
could come up with?

314
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:17,816
Was it?

315
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,618
You damn geezer.

316
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,820
Every little thing has
to be a fight with you!

317
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,255
Well, I'm sick and tired of it!

318
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,257
Bring it on! Huh?

319
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,794
[ZEFF] Hmph. I never
have liked children.

320
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,630
As a matter of fact,
I hate children.

321
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,632
There wasn't a day passed
when I didn't regret

322
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,835
letting a useless little
brat like you live, Sanji.

323
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,872
Ha! Fine by me,
you rotten old man.

324
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,841
Enjoy the rest of
your miserable life.

325
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,350
[YOSAKU] Whoa!
This is a nice ship!

326
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,985
You sure it's okay to use her?

327
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,854
[COOK A] Of course!
It's Sanji's ship!

328
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,823
[COOK B]
You still need more?

329
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,391
[LUFFY]
Yup! Gonna need more meat!

330
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,661
All right, well how many days
are you gonna be out at sea?

331
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,330
[LUFFY]
I don't know...

332
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,364
[ZEFF]
Kid?

333
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,899
[LUFFY]
Hm? Hey, Pops!

334
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,000
Would you like this?

335
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,234
It's my logbook,

336
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,405
a detailed record of my one
year journey to the Grand Line.

337
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,174
No thanks.

338
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,076
He. He. I knew it!

339
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,345
[laughs]

340
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,349
[LUFFY] Oooh‐ ooh! I want
some more of that marbled meat!

341
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,684
That's enough meat for you!

342
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,260
[SANJI] It's the nicest sea
restaurant I've ever seen!

343
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,196
That's for sure!

344
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,720
[ZEFF]
Hey, Sanji, listen...

345
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,889
[SANJI]
Hm? What is it?

346
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,891
[ZEFF] It doesn't matter
what sort of person

347
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,393
walks through our doors.

348
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,927
