WEBVTT

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.447
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.354
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.657
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.866
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.435
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.510
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:17.094
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.127 --> 00:03:18.731
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:20.601
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:24.509
and launch an attack on
Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.751
With the kingdom in chaos,
the final battle begins at last.

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.290
And for Law, it turns out
the fight was personal.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:34.963
I'm grateful to you, too.

00:03:34.997 --> 00:03:38.971
You gave me the power I need
to kick your ass, after all.

00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:40.373
What's the Op-Op Fruit do?

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.645
It let's you modify
someone's body!

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:44.415
You can perform
miracle operations

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:46.620
and cure any nasty diseases!

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:49.392
Listen, we'll get
the jump on Doffy!

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:53.166
We'll steal the Op-Op Fruit
before anybody else can have it!

00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.406
[NARRATOR] Traveling to
Minion Island along with Law,

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.111
Corazon raided the hideout
of the pirate Barrels

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:00.648
and stole the Op-Op Fruit.

00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:03.888
However, his escape
did not go as planned.

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:08.263
[ROSINANTE] I got it, Law!
Just like I said I would!

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:11.670
We're gonna cure that
disease of yours right up!

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:18.450
That freaked me out!
Who's that?

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:22.091
Hey! A guy in a black coat
just stole the Op-Op Fruit

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:24.361
and he was coming this way!

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.666
[BARRELS PIRATES]
It's him!

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:08.651
Don't let your guard down.

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:11.957
Doflamingo is quite formidable.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.492
[FEMARINES]
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.670
[TSURU]
I wonder, Sengoku.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.044
Where did you find this intel?

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:23.981
Who do you work with?

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:26.954
[MARINE B]
Vice Admiral Tsuru!

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.022
[TSURU]
Hm?

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:29.526
[MARINE B] We got a call
from the lookout ship

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.395
on Minion Island!

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:43.220
[TSURU]
Barrels' hideout is on fire?

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:46.025
Yes! We're going to
investigate it now.

00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:47.562
[TSURU]
Call them back!

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:50.200
If the pirates find out
we sent battleships,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:51.603
then the deal is off!

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.607
Check the coastal area instead!

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.079
Report to me if you
see anyone suspicious.

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:57.648
Yes, ma'am!

00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:29.812
[BARRELS PIRATE A]
How are we gonna put this out?

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:43.874
[BARRELS PIRATE B gasps]
Captain Barrels! You okay?

00:06:45.177 --> 00:06:46.947
[BARRELS]
Get off me!

00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:50.286
We can worry about
our injuries later!

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.794
This is a five-billion
berry deal!

00:06:53.827 --> 00:06:58.169
We have to get that
fruit back right now!

00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:08.724
[LAW]
Cora...

00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:10.762
[chuckles]

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:14.202
[LAW] Good. You made it
back after all.

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.005
[ROSINANTE]
Silence.

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.113
Look, Law!

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:22.785
I brought a surprise with me!

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.929
[LAW] I heard gunshots and
saw the building burning,

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:31.770
so I thought something
might've happened to you.

00:07:32.972 --> 00:07:36.513
Hey! Can't I get a smile
and a "thank you"?

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:38.717
We did it, pal!

00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.320
I'm gonna save your life!

00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:42.525
You should be happy!

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:46.165
Yeah, but even if I eat
that Devil Fruit, I...

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:48.670
I might not get better, right?

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.042
You'll get better!

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:52.879
So open wide, Law!

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:57.087
Eat up and heal up!
What're you waiting for?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.858
[LAW]
It's gross!

00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:02.164
I don't care!
Just eat the damn thing!

00:08:02.197 --> 00:08:04.902
You chew and swallow!

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.276
No fair! Cora!

00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:26.647
I wasn't ready!

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.982
Now I have weird powers?

00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:30.821
I didn't even ask
for this, you know!

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.639
[LAW]
Uh, hey... Cora?

00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:45.483
It's fine, okay? I did my part.

00:08:45.517 --> 00:08:47.822
And now you can
go cure yourself.

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:50.695
We just outsmarted Doflamingo.

00:08:50.728 --> 00:08:53.032
I'd call this a victory.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.538
Don't lay in the snow.
You'll get sick!

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:58.677
Are you worn out,
or what? [gasps]

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.781
Lemme turn you over.

00:09:05.323 --> 00:09:07.662
[LAW gasps]

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.565
[LAW screams]

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:11.102
[LAW]
You're covered in blood!

00:09:11.135 --> 00:09:14.943
What happened?
Did someone shoot you?

00:09:14.976 --> 00:09:17.147
[ROSINANTE]
Yeah, I got clumsy.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.821
[LAW] Damn it! Why didn't you
say something sooner?

00:09:21.723 --> 00:09:23.392
[LAW]
Wait a sec!

00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:26.131
Get better! Come on!

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:29.839
Get better!

00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:34.348
Stop bleeding! Stop bleeding!

00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:37.421
[chuckles] Don't be silly!

00:09:37.454 --> 00:09:41.797
Like I said, you need knowledge
to make the Op-Op powers work.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.434
Help me! Tell me what to do!

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:46.205
You got shot 'cause of me!

00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:48.844
I have to fix this!

00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:51.215
I just got clumsy, like I said.

00:09:51.248 --> 00:09:54.589
Same as always, right? Heheh.

00:09:54.623 --> 00:09:58.096
Law. Don't worry about me.

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:01.001
I won't die from something
like this. [coughs]

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.471
[LAW]
Cora!

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:05.645
[ROSINANTE] But we still
need to staunch the bleeding,

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.649
or I'll be in bad shape.

00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:09.853
Listen carefully, okay?

00:10:09.886 --> 00:10:13.927
We got the Op-Op Fruit,
just like I said we would,

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:15.330
but it's gonna
take more than that

00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:17.935
to stop Doffy in his tracks.

00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:20.473
This isn't over just yet.

00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:24.215
I know you're in bad shape,
but I need to ask a favor.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.385
[ROSINANTE]
There's a Navy lookout ship

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.891
on the west coast
of this island.

00:10:29.793 --> 00:10:33.834
[ROSINANTE] Take this
and hand this over to them.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.640
It's not a trick.
If a Marine sees this,

00:10:36.673 --> 00:10:39.111
they would know exactly
what to do with it.

00:10:39.144 --> 00:10:42.719
This one little package
will save a country.

00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:45.658
A faraway kingdom
called Dressrosa.

00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:47.361
I don't get it.

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:50.366
Besides, I told you before
how much I hate the Navy.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.972
[ROSINANTE] Your father
was a great doctor, right?

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:54.074
[gasps]

00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:56.646
But you have a power
even greater than that now

00:10:56.679 --> 00:11:00.621
to heal more than
sickness, okay?

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:03.527
Trust me. It'll all work out.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.433
As soon as you deliver this,
we'll get off this island.

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:16.251
And then we can travel the world
together, just you and I.

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:29.779
[gasps]

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.093
[LAW]
Marines.

00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:01.074
[LAW]
Okay, he's alone.

00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:16.539
[LAW]
Hey, take this.

00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:20.480
[VERGO]
Hm. A secret message?

00:12:20.514 --> 00:12:24.287
I don't know who gave this
to you, but I'm grateful.

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.697
I'll take good care of this.

00:12:28.731 --> 00:12:30.934
So don't you worry.

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:34.842
But you sound kind of
sick, kid. Are you okay?

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:39.117
I can trust you, can't I?

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.190
Uh-huh. Like I said,

00:12:42.223 --> 00:12:43.894
I'll make sure that letter
gets to the right hands.

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:47.602
No, listen, I need you
to help someone.

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:48.837
He was shot.

00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:50.975
He's in really bad shape!

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:54.215
Please! You have to save him!

00:12:54.248 --> 00:12:58.288
I don't know what I
would do if he died!

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:03.199
[LAW]
He got hurt because of me!

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.138
[LAW crying]

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.755
[gasps] Cora, hey!

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:19.965
I found someone to
give you first aid! Cora!

00:13:23.807 --> 00:13:25.577
Hang in there!

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:27.715
Vergo!

00:13:27.748 --> 00:13:30.320
Corazon? What are you
doing out here?

00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:32.457
Hm? Did you just talk?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.626
[ROSINANTE]
Aw crap!

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.231
So that was his
secret mission, huh?

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:45.483
[LAW gasps]
You know each other?

00:13:45.517 --> 00:13:48.455
Wait, did you call him Vergo?

00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:50.995
[LAW]
Who's Vergo?

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:53.265
[ROSINANTE] An extremely
powerful individual.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.903
Right now he's away
from the Family

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:56.940
on a secret operation.

00:13:56.973 --> 00:13:59.612
But the details of that
are between him and Doffy.

00:13:59.646 --> 00:14:03.352
That guy has nothing to do
with you, so forget about him.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.407
Don't you dare! That's--

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.590
[ROSINANTE] He was infiltrating
the Navy all this time.

00:14:21.623 --> 00:14:24.327
I see. What a sick joke.

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.398
There are probably
thousands of Marines here

00:14:26.431 --> 00:14:29.471
and somehow this bastard
gets the letter?

00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:33.646
[VERGO] I get the message
loud and clear.

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:41.963
Give it back!

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:50.012
[gasps] Cora!

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:12.056
Cora!

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.741
You listen to me.

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:22.678
He's hurt enough!

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.753
[LAW]
Damn it! Go away! You bastard!

00:15:26.787 --> 00:15:28.757
[panting]

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.629
You work for Doflamingo, huh?

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:37.240
And how would you
know that? I get it.

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:40.948
You must be that new boy Law,
from the "White Town."

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:43.085
Doffy told me all about you.

00:15:43.118 --> 00:15:46.760
About how you two
ran off. Traitors.

00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:49.633
You need to learn
some respect, kid.

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.035
If you know my position,

00:15:51.068 --> 00:15:54.542
then you should have the sense
to call me Mister Vergo!

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:56.612
[groans]

00:16:01.188 --> 00:16:02.457
Law!

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.531
You really spilled the beans
in this secret report of yours.

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.436
If the Navy got a hold
of info like this,

00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:11.275
that would be the end
of the Family.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.550
But we have so much
unfinished business.

00:16:18.322 --> 00:16:22.230
[VERGO] You would betray
the Family over one child?

00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:25.737
You're nothing but a rat!

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.045
[grunts]

00:16:31.415 --> 00:16:34.521
[VERGO] A disgrace
as the Second Corazon!

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:39.464
[grunts]

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.971
You think I didn't suspect you?

00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:45.109
I remember when you were
eight and went missing,

00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:47.748
only to show up again
14 years later.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:52.592
If it was up to me, I would've
turned you away on the spot.

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:54.294
But Doffy trusted you.

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:57.300
Because you're
his brother, after all.

00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:01.308
You earned this fate, Rosinante.

00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:12.397
[LAW]
No... Cora...

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.367
He's gonna die!

00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:15.904
[groaning]

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:19.946
[VERGO grunting]

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.616
[cries]

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:26.091
Stop, Vergo! That's enough!

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:38.783
[gasps]

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:49.404
[VERGO grunts]

00:17:56.217 --> 00:17:57.988
[DOFLAMINGO]
Whoa, hold on.

00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:00.326
You didn't kill them, did you?

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:03.498
[VERGO]
They're still breathing. Barely.

00:18:08.175 --> 00:18:11.281
[DOFLAMINGO] All right,
so what did you find out?

00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:13.686
[VERGO]
Corazon was a spy for the Navy.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.593
He's been working with them on
a plot to take out the Family.

00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:18.663
[BARRELS PIRATES yell]

00:18:18.696 --> 00:18:20.634
[VERGO]
Careful. They're probably onto

00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:24.341
our Devil Fruit plan.
Where are you right now?

00:18:24.374 --> 00:18:26.044
[DOFLAMINGO] I was watching
the rendezvous spot

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:27.715
on Swallow Island earlier,

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:30.820
but I noticed two warships
approach from a distance.

00:18:30.854 --> 00:18:34.260
After that, I couldn't hide
from the truth anymore.

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:38.503
My sweet little brother was
baring his fangs at me.

00:18:40.273 --> 00:18:42.277
[DOFLAMINGO]
Although that's unfortunate,

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.216
it did remind me of
something important.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.821
You guys are my real family.

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:51.194
I suppose I had to face
reality sooner or later.

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:53.700
At any rate, we're at
Minion Island right now.

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.770
Close to you, I'd think.

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:01.348
Pity we didn't arrive
here a bit sooner.

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.085
The first thing we saw
when we got here

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:05.256
was a bunch of Barrels
Pirates screaming about

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:07.961
the Devil Fruit being stolen.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:10.166
Corazon's work, I'm sure.

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:12.638
In other words,
don't let him go anywhere!

00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:14.407
He has the Op-Op Fruit!

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.048
Okay. I'll make sure-- Damn it!

00:19:18.082 --> 00:19:20.520
[DOFLAMINGO]
Oh, ran away already?

00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:21.355
[VERGO groans]

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:23.492
[DOFLAMINGO]
Well, no worries.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:28.636
[DOFLAMINGO] I'm sure they're
still on the island, after all.

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.675
We'll hunt them
down soon enough.

00:19:51.014 --> 00:19:52.885
Hey, uh. Y'seein this?

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:54.420
That's not snow!

00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:55.223
Huh?

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:57.294
What now? That's creepy!

00:19:57.327 --> 00:19:58.462
[BARRELS PIRATES gasp]

00:19:58.496 --> 00:20:00.733
[BARRELS PIRATE G]
This can't be good!

00:20:06.344 --> 00:20:08.282
[BARRELS PIRATE H] Those things
are sharp as a knife!

00:20:08.316 --> 00:20:09.785
[BARRELS PIRATE I]
And rock solid, too!

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.891
[BARRELS PIRATE H] Damn it!
Someone trapped us in here!

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:20.874
Where am I? What happened?

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:24.748
Where's Vergo?

00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:26.886
What are those?

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:30.392
[ROSINANTE] One of Doffy's
abilities, I would imagine.

00:20:30.426 --> 00:20:32.931
I've never seen it myself,

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.103
but one thing is
perfectly clear.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:37.607
There's nowhere to run.

00:20:47.527 --> 00:20:51.301
I'm so sorry!
Somebody stop me!

00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:54.440
[BARRELS PIRATES yelling]

00:20:56.745 --> 00:21:00.353
[ROSINANTE] He's using the
Parasite String, of course.

00:21:00.386 --> 00:21:02.858
We're locked in cage.

00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:05.463
This is a living hell.

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:11.675
[BARRELS PIRATES screaming]

00:21:13.412 --> 00:21:17.386
[LAW]
Cora, what's going on out there?

00:22:06.953 --> 00:22:09.658
[ROSINANTE] I don't think
I can save myself,

00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:12.129
but maybe I can still save him.

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:16.371
[ROSINANTE]
This may be the end of the road,

00:22:16.405 --> 00:22:19.645
but I hope you'll
remember me when I'm gone.

00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:23.853
[ROSINANTE] I promise I'll
go out with a smile.

00:22:32.772 --> 00:22:35.242
[ROSINANTE]
Maybe it's not worth much,

00:22:35.275 --> 00:22:37.948
but if you do think back
on me someday...

00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:44.160
[ROSINANTE] ...I'd rather
you remember me smiling.

00:22:54.982 --> 00:22:57.587
[ROSINANTE]
We gotta get moving, buddy.

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:04.801
[gasps, screams]

00:23:04.835 --> 00:23:06.471
Let's go!

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.226
[NARRATOR] Backed into a corner
by the Don Quixote Family,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.030
Corazon faces his brother.

00:23:19.063 --> 00:23:21.669
Making one final gamble,
with his life on the line,

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:24.474
a single bullet decides
Corazon's fate.

00:23:24.508 --> 00:23:25.778
And in a sudden instant,

00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:28.583
Law begins on the
path towards freedom.

00:23:28.617 --> 00:23:30.419
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.722
"Advance, Law!

00:23:31.756 --> 00:23:34.494
The Kindhearted
Man's Final Fight!"

00:23:34.528 --> 00:23:37.433
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
