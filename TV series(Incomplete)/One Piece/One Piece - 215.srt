00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,051
[ITOMIMIZU] The Straw Hat
Dangers have managed

2
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,321
to pull off a
come-from-behind victory!

3
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,289
The final round of
the Davy Back Fight

4
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,591
comes to a dramatic end!

5
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,262
It's over, my
Slow-Slow Beam failed me...

6
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,332
We won! We won!
We won! We won! We won!

7
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,236
I'm begging you please
pick me this time!

8
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,770
Looks like it all worked out.

9
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,071
Seems so.

10
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,576
[ITOMIMIZU] Now it's time to
choose your new crewmember!

11
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,079
Who do you want,
Straw Hat Luffy?!

12
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,081
C'mon Chopper, get over here!

13
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,484
[sobbing hysterically]

14
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,286
[LUFFY chuckles]

15
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,321
I'll miss you, Choppy!

16
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,325
I was so scared!
I'm so happy you won!

17
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,392
Are you kidding?

18
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,829
Buncha suckers like that
could never beat my crew!

19
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,431
[ITOMIMIZU] We've seen blood,
sweat, and plenty of tears today

20
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,534
but the Davy Back Fight
has finally drawn to a close!

21
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,536
With the Straw Hats
reclaiming their doctor,

22
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,173
Tony Tony Chopper, I'd say
this match ends in a draaaaaw!

23
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,576
[FOXY]
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

24
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,377
Huh?

25
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,378
Hmm?

26
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,280
Any captain worth his
weight in seaweed knows

27
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,548
that there are no "draws"
in the pirate world!

28
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,584
It's plunder or be plundered!

29
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,753
You won't let it end
like this, will you?

30
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,592
Wait is he saying
what I think he is?!

31
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,228
C'mon how 'bout
another three-coin game

32
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,364
to decide which one
of us is really the best.

33
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,766
Yeah, like we'd agree to that.

34
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,833
After all the cheating,

35
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,169
you'd have to be an idiot
to go for another round.

36
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,304
[gunshot bang]

37
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,140
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no, no, no.

38
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

39
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,346
You're on, Split Head! Hahaha!

40
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,348
What if we lose Chopper
again--or worse yet--

41
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,216
what if you lose me and
I get stuck with those weirdos

42
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,320
while you and all of our friends
get lost at sea and die?!

43
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:43,691
Okay, this is the last time.
I won't do it again, I promise.

44
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,692
You're kidding.

45
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,528
I don't know if I have
any tears left to cry.

46
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,197
He already agreed, so it's
not like we can back out now.

47
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,332
I doubt he would
go to the trouble

48
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,200
if he didn't have
something in mind.

49
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,469
Eh, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

50
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,271
Well, unless he's
thinking he can nab us

51
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,206
a shipwright from Foxy's Crew.

52
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,284
[ITOMIMIZU] It's time for
the second three-coin game!

53
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:13,153
The events this time are a
team-wide dodgeball showdown;

54
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,356
a brutal new twist on
a childhood favorite;

55
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,591
and a one-on-one
boxing beat down!

56
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,460
Like the previous game,
each crewmember

57
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,161
can only participate twice!

58
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,195
In other words,

59
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,831
last minute lineup changes
will not be allowed!

60
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,366
No two ways about it,

61
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,167
this time they're
gonna pick me for sure.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,103
Yeah right, I know they've
got their eyes on me.

63
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,306
I'm doomed to spend the rest
of my life as their poster girl.

64
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,774
[FOXY PIRATE A and B]
Keep telling yourself that,

65
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,776
but we don't want
either of you on our crew.

66
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,811
You're too scary
and he's too weak.

67
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,447
With our second Davy Back Fight
of the day about to start,

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,549
I'm back in the announcer's
seat to explain the rules

69
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,351
of our first match!

70
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,087
The name of the game
is "Hit and Dead Ball!"

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,389
The balls in question
are the two you

72
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,057
see on the field right now.

73
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,159
If the opposing team hits
you with one of those babies,

74
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,627
you're out of the game!

75
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,830
The teams are divided into
on-court and off-court members.

76
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,465
They're free to choose
which ones go where

77
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,399
in whatever number

78
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,834
but once you run out
of on-court members,

79
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,336
you lose the match.

80
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,305
Keep in mind that although
the off-court members

81
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,473
can throw the ball around
just like anyone else,

82
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,808
they are not allowed
to enter the court

83
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,610
under any circumstance!

84
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,211
They make it
sound all fancy,

85
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,714
but it just seems like
regular old dodgeball to me.

86
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,516
[ITOMIMIZU] There are some
other miscellaneous details,

87
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,351
so be sure to read
the rulebook carefully!

88
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,121
That's the rulebook?

89
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,224
You wouldn't expect
it to be so thick.

90
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,093
[ITOMIMIZU] Hit and Dead
Ball is one of the greatest

91
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,262
and most time-honored
Davy Back Fight games!

92
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,297
Because it has been played
so many times over the years,

93
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,532
more and more
rules have been added

94
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,467
to balance and
perfect its form!

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,269
Only by strict
adherence to those rules

96
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,171
can the game truly be enjoyed!

97
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:38,739
What's the point in preaching
to us about the rules

98
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,075
if you're gonna end up
breaking them all, anyway?

99
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,276
Did you just give
us the rulebook

100
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:44,078
so we'll know how
bad you're cheating?

101
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,446
No, no, no!

102
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,715
Take a look at the
first page, mademoiselle!

103
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,218
"Referee Regulations. He who
makes a judgment contrary

104
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,121
to the rules written here
shall be beheaded on the spot."

105
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,223
Beheaded?! Scary!

106
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,658
And there you have it.

107
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,793
On that topic, this
game will be officiated

108
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,529
by a team of five
referees, headed by a vet

109
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,834
with fifty years of
experience, Rokuroshi!

110
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,935
With any luck,

111
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:10,271
we might actually get a
fair fight this time around.

112
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,307
[ITOMIMIZU] Team Foxy has a
veritable armada of players!

113
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,377
Truly a stupendous
spectacle to see!

114
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,079
Sadly, the Straw Hats
pale in comparison

115
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,781
with their diminutive showing.

116
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,483
Sporting a measly
seven members,

117
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,485
I must wonder if
they're even trying!

118
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,753
Okay, we get it!

119
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,821
[ITOMIMIZU] Let's get
this show on the road!

120
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,690
We'll start the match off
with the double opening tip!

121
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:35,061
Each team bring two players
to the center of the field.

122
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:40,334
Hey, do you mind if I do this?

123
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,770
Hm? Yeah, be my guest.

124
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:45,105
Go jump your
heart out, little guy.

125
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,206
All right!

126
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,412
[ITOMIMIZU]
Chopper has transformed!

127
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,614
It looks like he's not
just fluff after all!

128
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,249
He could turn out to
be a powerful player

129
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,283
for the Straw Hats!

130
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,621
Oh no! What's that?!
Now he's not cute at all!

131
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:03,089
Ready, set and go!

132
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,539
Nice catch! Now give 'em
a good spike to the face!

133
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,542
Aim straight for
Split-Head! C'mon Chopper!

134
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,210
Let's go!

135
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,112
Right!

136
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,185
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh no!
Our boss is in trouble!

137
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,660
What, he's already
out of the game?!

138
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,363
Yeah! You really showed
their boss who's boss!

139
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:43,697
Safe! Safe!

140
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,832
What do you mean "safe"?!

141
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,067
That was a clean hit,
you old fart!

142
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,069
It's a violation of Article 23!

143
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,105
Blows to the
face do not count!

144
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,439
You're kidding!

145
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,808
Now what?

146
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,744
Wow, Boss, that
looked like it hurt!

147
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,845
Puh-puh-puh!

148
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,547
Don't laugh, Hamburg,
you're gonna make Boss cry.

149
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,186
Get them while
they're distracted!

150
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,055
Give 'em a good
one for me, Sanji!

151
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,426
Yeah! I'll show them the
power of our sweet love!

152
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,527
Here they come!

153
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,495
You might wanna
clear out of here!

154
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,107
Hey take it easy,
we're still warming up here!

155
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,823
Eighteen members
of Team Foxy

156
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,292
are hereby eliminated for
getting knocked out of bounds!

157
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,259
Way to go!

158
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,795
[ITOMIMIZU] What a show
from the Straw Hats!

159
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,762
The chef and the swordsman

160
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,332
both blew nine players
right off the field!

161
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,734
Damn, I thought
I'd get more than you.

162
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:57,137
Yeah! Knock 'em dead, Sanji!
Knock em' dead, Zoro!

163
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,340
Pardon me.

164
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,279
Wow, do you think we can
take out nine people, too?

165
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,380
Nine? I'll do ten!

166
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,019
Gum-Gum Slingshot!

167
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,263
Out of bounds!

168
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,732
Ten members from
Team Foxy are eliminated!

169
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,202
Oh, yeah! That's a new record!

170
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,671
[ITOMIMIZU] Yet another strong
showing from the Straw Hats!

171
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,172
They're thinning
out the competition,

172
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,675
but Team Foxy
finally has a ball!

173
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,277
Let's see how many
I can knock out!

174
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,080
Go on Chopper! Even the
score! 9, 10, 11, or more!

175
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,048
Sure you got it!

176
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,665
[ITOMIMIZU]
Oh!

177
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,067
A last minute catch from
Hamburg saves the day!

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,536
Now Team Foxy has both
balls in their possession!

179
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,805
Could it finally be
time for a comeback?

180
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,806
Puh-puh-puh!

181
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,675
Nice work as always Hamburg.

182
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,777
Now why don't you pass
those balls to Big Pan?

183
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,344
Roger, Boss!

184
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,784
Right! This is it!
Take 'em all out in one shot!

185
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,561
Not me! Please not me!

186
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,410
Usopp! No!

187
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,714
[ITOMIMIZU]
What happened?! I can't see!

188
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,117
Out of bounds!

189
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,819
Mister Long Nose and 22 members

190
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,288
of Team Foxy are
hereby eliminated!

191
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,326
That looked bad.
Are you okay?!

192
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,162
Yeah It takes more
than that to kill me.

193
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,331
Hey, and look, I got the ball!

194
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,367
[ITOMIMIZU] Big Pan's
devastating dodge ball smash

195
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,802
eliminated the Straw Hat's
long-nosed sniper,

196
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,738
but caused a crushing
amount of collateral damage

197
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,872
to his own team!

198
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:15,709
Now Foxy and Hamburg are
the only ones left on the field!

199
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,478
At this rate,
the Foxy Pirates may be

200
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,414
undone by their own strength!

201
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,649
The match is now two to four!

202
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,287
What's next?
Who will reign supreme?

203
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,545
Hey, Boss. What now?

204
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,813
What do you mean "what now?"

205
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,780
I can't use my Slow-Slow Beam

206
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,517
as long as that
archeologist chick is here.

207
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,520
So, there's only
one choice left.

208
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,723
You mean "you-know-what"?
Puh-puh-puh!

209
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,425
"You-know-what" indeed!

210
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,393
Feh-feh-feh!

211
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,267
[ITOMIMIZU]
What a turn of events!

212
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,502
Now Hamburg is out
of the game, too!

213
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,405
Hahaha! Good one, Robin.

214
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,708
Hamburg is safe!

215
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,776
You sure?
Article 54 states that

216
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,245
while the face doesn't count,

217
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,248
the top of the head
is still fair game.

218
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,216
If I were you, I'd start
using my head fast,

219
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,751
before somebody chops it off!

220
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,753
The girl is right.
Hamburg is out!

221
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,720
I'm sorry, Sir.

222
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,190
The Straw Hat's
archaeologist has memorized

223
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,092
the massive rulebook
in only moments

224
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,828
by flexing the mighty
muscles of her mind!

225
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:43,430
You read all that?! Awesome!

226
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,498
Thanks for the compliment,

227
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,567
but I'm only about
halfway through.

228
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,535
Well either way,
they've only got one left,

229
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,470
so let's finish 'em off quick!

230
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,674
You got it!

231
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,509
Hey, Sanji? Tee-hee!

232
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,312
Yes, ladies?

233
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,081
Please don't hit our boss...
Tee-hee!

234
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,284
Just give that
ball to us, okay?

235
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:04,651
Of course!

236
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,519
You're so sweet!

237
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,189
Now would you mind getting
knocked out of the game?

238
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,758
As a favor? For me?

239
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,292
Aaah!!

240
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,461
Why, it would be
my pleasure, Ma'am.

241
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,763
You can hit me
wherever you like!

242
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,734
If you don't get up,
I'll knock you out!

243
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,474
[ITOMIMIZU]
Oh!

244
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,510
Love hunter Sanji has
been blissfully bludgeoned

245
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,079
and endearingly
eliminated from the game!

246
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,781
Now he'll be joining his
long-nosed companion

247
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,583
on the sidelines!

248
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:37,083
Bye-bye!

249
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,420
You make me sick.

250
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,788
We should've seen that coming.

251
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,757
On the upside, their
boss is the only one left.

252
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,359
We can't celebrate yet.

253
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,128
You never know what might
happen until the very end.

254
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,330
Yes, good point.

255
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,201
Huh? No way.

256
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,435
What the?!

257
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,937
[ITOMIMIZU]
There it is!

258
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,139
Hit and Dead Ball's
top secret weapon

259
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,041
finally makes an appearance!

260
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,812
Say hello to the
Mr. Accu-Cannon!

261
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,716
Feh-feh-feh!

262
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,085
Hey ref, are you
really gonna allow this?

263
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,187
That thing's obviously
against the rules!

264
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,588
So that's Mr. Accu-Cannon?

265
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,223
Wait, why are you
acting like you know

266
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,459
all about this doohickey?
Did I miss something?

267
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,761
I ran across an article
about it in the rulebook,

268
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:23,397
but I hadn't actually
seen the device until now.

269
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,599
Rule number three
hundred twenty-two.

270
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,102
The only weapon allowed
is Mr. Accu-Cannon.

271
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,471
Why would you make a rule
just for that dumb thing?

272
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,740
I dunno. Seems
pretty awesome to me!

273
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:33,707
What's the point?

274
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,709
Listen, I don't care
how big your Mr. Cannon

275
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,112
whatever is, you're
still gonna lose!

276
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,380
I wouldn't be so sure.

277
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,748
Feh-feh-feh...

278
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,217
Hey Porche, you ready
to finish them off?

279
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,054
I thought you'd never ask,
Boss! Better not blink!

280
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:50,124
Flower Hypnosis go!

281
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:50,824
Not again!

282
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,294
Hurry up and close your eyes!

283
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:54,261
[LUFFY]
Oh.

284
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,497
Can you play without
dirty tricks for once?

285
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,065
Now's your chance! Fire!

286
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,501
Oh, I will! Like
shooting fish in a barrel!

287
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,107
[thinking] I don't
have to see I can feel.

288
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:14,381
Even without my swords,
I'm still a swordsman.

289
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,618
[ITOMIMIZU]
What power!

290
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,421
The swordless swordsman
not only sliced the ball

291
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,324
in half with his bare hands,
he did it with his eyes closed!

292
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:24,558
Oh no.

293
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,727
Zoro of Team Straw Hat is out!

294
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,162
Why?! What'd I do?!

295
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:28,862
Huh?

296
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,165
[RUKOROSHI]
Rule number 645!

297
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,267
Even with hands,
no slicing the ball!

298
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,469
Rules also state that
Foxy gets a new ball!

299
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,603
What?!

300
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:42,409
Oh well, better luck next time!
Feh-feh-feh!

301
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,243
[ITOMIMIZU]
What a shame!

302
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,079
It was an impressive
move from Zoro,

303
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,680
but the rules are the rules!

304
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,248
You okay?

305
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,618
I don't think he's
taking this too well.

306
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,520
Hey--

307
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,521
Whatever you're about to say,
I don't want to hear it,

308
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,624
especially after that
stunt you just pulled.

309
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,426
Wow! The match
is now two to one!

310
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,162
And Mr. Accu-Cannon
is ready to go!

311
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,533
Feh-feh-feh!

312
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,402
Time to pick up
where I left off!

313
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,037
Yeah? Then let's
see what you got!

314
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,041
Bring it on!

315
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,644
Ultra-fast Level 5, go!

316
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:20,480
Let's see you dodge
this, you brats! Ha!

317
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,699
No! Choppy!

318
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,402
[ITOMIMIZU] The doctor makes a
noble sacrifice for his captain!

319
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,170
But is this the end for him?

320
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:47,274
Hey! They said hits to the
face don't count, right?

321
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,410
Was that his face?

322
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,811
Huh... Now that
you mention it,

323
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,746
I'm not sure where
that is, exactly.

324
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,683
With all that fluff,
it's sort of hard to tell.

325
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,817
He's so brave!

326
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,687
Hey ref, can't you see a
pirate's honor is at stake here?

327
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,221
I'm telling you,
that was his face!

328
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,756
That's right!
Any real man knows

329
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,160
to show some respect when a
pirate takes one for the team!

330
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:11,632
Hit in the face! Hit in
the face! Hit in the face!

331
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,367
What the?

332
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,405
Hit in the face! Hit in
the face! Hit in the face!

333
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,341
A pirate's honor is at stake?

334
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,109
Then the choice
is obvious, isn't it?

335
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,477
The ball hit him in the face

336
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,579
and blows to the
face do not count!

337
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,415
Yeah! You're the best!

338
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,716
However...

339
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,552
However?

340
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,388
Even if blows to
the face don't count,

341
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,257
you're out of bounds,
so you're still eliminated!

342
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:43,163
[ITOMIMIZU] Say it ain't so!
This is a real tragedy!

343
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,431
Even after the
ref acknowledged

344
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,034
his captain-saving-face-block,
he's still out!

345
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,803
The brave little doctor
will surely be missed by all!

346
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:54,141
Even so, he will be remembered
as a true man of the sea!

347
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,576
Choppy!

348
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,379
[LUFFY]
Hey, you still hanging in there?

349
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,447
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.

350
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,582
I'm out of the
game, either way.

351
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:07,121
Don't worry.
Leave the rest to me.

352
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,823
Oh and thanks,
Chopper. Nice save.

353
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,293
Eh-heh. What makes you
think I want to hear that?

354
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,794
That doesn't make me
happy at all, you big jerk!

355
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,565
Feh-feh-feh!
Not too bad, Choppy!

356
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,569
I can't wait till I win
and you're back on my crew!

357
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,070
Gotta go through
me first, Split Head!

358
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,338
[ITOMIMIZU]
Heh heh heh...

359
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:27,474
Both teams are backed
against the wall as

360
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:31,245
our courageous captains face off
in a climactic confrontation!

361
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,746
Feh-feh-feh!

362
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,448
I'll warn you,
this is gonna hurt.

363
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,184
I think I'd give up
now if I were you!

364
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,619
Ha! Why would I give up

365
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,287
when you're the one
who's gonna lose?!

366
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,222
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

367
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,657
Why don't you take
a good look around

368
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,627
before you start
spouting nonsense?

369
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,298
[ITOMIMIZU] Here it comes!
The Omni-Directional Shift!

370
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,667
[PORCHE]
Say your prayers, rubber boy!

371
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,169
[USOPP]
What're they doing now?!

372
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:56,470
Hey! What's up
with all those balls,

373
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,672
old man that's gotta
be against the rules!

374
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,708
The rulebook clearly
states that players can use

375
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:03,043
as many fake
balls as they like.

376
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,679
You talk big, but you're
just as bad as the last ref!

377
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,648
Damn unless we can
get a ref of our own,

378
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,350
we're never gonna
see the end of this.

379
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,685
Don't pay any attention
to those guys, Luffy,

380
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,288
you and Foxy are the only
ones with a real ball!

381
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,789
Just keep your eye on him!

382
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,591
Oh! How did she know?!

383
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,059
What's wrong with this guy?

384
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,629
I'm starting to think
his brain is split, too.

385
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,197
[FOXY thinking]
If they call me "Split-Brain,"

386
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,599
I swear I'm gonna cry.

387
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,601
Sorry, pal. It looks
like I'm gonna have to

388
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,604
break your
Mr. Whatchamacallit thing!

389
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,239
Ahh!

390
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,773
Here goes!

391
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,443
Hello!

392
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:39,179
Take this!

393
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,022
[PORCHE]
Oh my! Where'd this come from?

394
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:52,793
Better watch where
you stretch that arm!

395
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:56,196
C'mon boys, let's shuffle!

396
00:19:56,229 --> 00:20:06,206
Shuffle time, Shuffle time,
Shuffle time, Shuffle time.

397
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:10,177
This is bad. If he can't
tell which ones are real

398
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,746
and which ones are fake,
he won't be able to dodge!

399
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:21,088
Feh-feh-feh!
All right Mr. Smart guy,

400
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,790
do you know which
balls are real now?

401
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,359
Better figure it out
fast before they hit you!

402
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,661
Shut up! I'll just
catch all the balls,

403
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,063
and then it won't matter!

404
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:31,265
Don't you get
snarky with me, boy!

405
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:34,034
Just sit back and accept
your defeat with grace!

406
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,103
Now, time to
let those balls fly!

407
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,305
[CROWD]
Yeah!

408
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,717
Hmph! Nice try
but you're finished.

409
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,018
Hey, look out behind you!

410
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,257
Luffy! Don't dodge.
Let it hit your face!

411
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,325
Right, easy for you to say!

412
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,563
He did it!

413
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,369
All right!

414
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,515
Straw Hat Luffy, you're out!

415
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:25,085
Why?! I thought it didn't count
if you got hit in the face!

416
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,355
Rule 999! Ingesting
any part of the ball

417
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,457
results in instant
disqualification!

418
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,660
Check the rulebook yourself
if you don't believe me.

419
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:38,632
Unfortunately, he's correct.
It's on the very last page.

420
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:42,469
What, why does
that rule even exist?!

421
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:48,109
[ITOMIMIZU]
It's over!

422
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:50,444
Straw Hat Luffy
has eaten his way

423
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:54,781
to defeat as Team Foxy claims
victory in the first round!

424

[USOPP] I remember playing
this game when I was a kid!

427
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,164
[FOXY] A kid wouldn't
last 5 minutes here

428
