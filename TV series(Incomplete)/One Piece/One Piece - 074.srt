00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,502
Why are they still there?

179
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,872
[panting]

180
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,240
We're okay now.

181
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,275
[sighs]

182
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,077
We didn't die.

183
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,911
We're still alive

184
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,347
but that really
didn't help at all.

185
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,515
That was a close one!

186
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,583
But why didn't
you guys run away?

187
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,951
[VIVI, NAMI]
Because we're stuck here!

188
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,219
Isn't that obvious?!

189
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,287
Oh, really?

190
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,889
So that's what's going on?

191
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,257
The only thing
you guys kept saying

192
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,092
was that I needed to
break the pillar...

193
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,293
So that's what I did.

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,427
Mister Bushido!

195
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,196
Do you really think it's
a good idea to put our lives

196
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,898
in that guy's hands?

197
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,534
Well, we don't exactly have
much of a choice, do we?

198
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,768
I don't know about you,

199
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,937
but I'm having a little bit
of trouble moving right now...

200
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,806
And you don't seem to be
bothered by it, somehow!

201
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,044
I... can't move...

202
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,549
What's happening?
My body... I don't know...

203
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:15,321
It... It won't move...
I can't move at all...

204
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,092
[MR. 3 cackles]

205
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,327
[MR. 3]
You fools!

206
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,896
All you did was move
the candles closer!

207
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,166
And by doing so, you only sped
up the solidifying process.

208
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,502
You'll become wax figures
even sooner, now!

209
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,137
Well done!

210
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,172
Ugh! That guy!

211
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,608
I wanna punch him,
right in his smug little face!

212
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,776
[squaks]

213
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,512
[LUFFY] Wait! You guys are
gonna turn into wax figures?

214
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,014
[NAMI] That's what we've
been trying to tell you!

215
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,617
[VIVI] Please just hurry up
and destroy this thing, Luffy!

216
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,519
[LUFFY]
Right, yeah, I'm on it!

217
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,354
[MR. 3]
I don't think so, Straw Hat!

218
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,189
Now, get out of my way!

219
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,458
Wax‐Wax... Harpoon!

220
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,659
Exploding Star!

221
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,194
[gasps]

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,101
[MR. 5 gulps]

223
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,936
[LUFFY yelps]

224
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,951
That's not very flavorful.

225
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,187
Your gunpowder must
not be too good.

226
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,223
There's no way! He ate it!

227
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,892
[squaks]

228
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,963
[ZORO] This isn't really
looking good for us, ladies...

229
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,965
This damn thing is speeding up.

230
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,900
Good thing I've
got my pose ready.

231
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,735
Moron!

232
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,205
Come on, Luffy!
You have to hurry!

233
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,075
Right! So the pumpkin
thing has to go.

234
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,077
I'm on it now! Gum‐Gum...

235
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,414
[MR. 3]
It's no use! Candle... Wall!

236
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,551
Bazooka!

237
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,356
Hey! Outta my way!

238
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,592
I was just thinking
the same thing.

239
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,428
I would greatly appreciate it
if you would quit interfering

240
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,998
with my creative
activities. Candle Lock!

241
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,603
I got a mallet...

242
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,570
[MR. 3]
Huh?

243
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,673
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum...

244
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,075
No you don't! Candle Wall!

245
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,943
[LUFFY]
Mallet!

246
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,287
[MR. 3 whimpers]

247
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,190
[MR. 3 screams]

248
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,363
M‐Mr. 3?!

249
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,964
No way!

250
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,403
[NAMI] Luffy! Hurry up
and break this thing

251
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,372
before we die up here!

252
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,075
Um, no...

253
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,610
Quit joking around and hurry.

254
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,411
[LUFFY]
Nuh‐uh.

255
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,380
[ZORO gasps]
Quit being an idiot!

256
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,449
Now's not really a good time!

257
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,318
[VIVI]
Luffy! Please just do it!

258
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,559
Not now... I...

259
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,428
...just don't feel
like saving you.

260
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,132
[pants]

261
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,134
Luffy, what's wrong?

262
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,004
My Colors Trap.

263
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:56,008
[panting]

264
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,444
[ZORO]
Hey, Luffy!

265
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,112
There's no time
to space out now!

266
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,047
Do somethin' about this already!

267
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,549
[LUFFY]
Yeah... I know.

268
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,484
[VIVI] Then quit just
standing there, will you?

269
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,020
[NAMI]
Come on, Luffy!

270
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,222
I know what I should do.

271
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,061
But... I don't feel like it...

272
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,130
Damn it! Why do you
keep saying that?

273
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,332
We're about to be
turned into wax statues!

274
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,368
Do you understand me?
We're going to die!

275
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,502
[LUFFY]
Yeah...

276
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,006
But for some reason, I can't
get motivated to help...

277
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,575
[ALL] What do you mean,
"can't get motivated"?!

278
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,881
What's going on here?
What is wrong with him?

279
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,316
Our friends are gonna
die if he doesn't

280
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,418
do something to help them soon.

281
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,055
I'll snap him out of it.

282
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,190
Let's go, Karoo.

283
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,558
[squaks]

284
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,027
Huh?

285
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,529
[USOPP, KAROO shriek]

286
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,565
[USOPP]
Where did you two come from?!

287
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,666
Just give up.

288
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,403
Your friend has already
fallen into a nasty trap.

289
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,370
That's right.

290
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,506
Haven't you noticed
what he's standing on?

291
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,074
Standing?

292
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,910
[USOPP]
Let me take a look.

293
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,048
[USOPP]
What's that? There's a strange

294
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,350
black pattern on the ground.

295
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,251
I don't get it.

296
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,420
What's so important
about that thing?

297
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,287
Yeah, you're right.

298
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,423
You really don't get it
at all, do you?

299
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,259
[laughs]

300
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,194
What's funny?

301
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,397
Paint... That's what's funny.

302
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,032
It's just paint...

303
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,269
You and your friends don't
stand a chance of escapin' now.

304
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,606
[USOPP screams]

305
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,442
[screaming]

306
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:42,047
[laughs]

307
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,648
[USOPP]

308
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,616
[KAROO screaming]

309
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,618
Karoo! Let's make a run for it!

310
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,453
[squaks]

311
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,655
Oh, great, now
they're running away.

312
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,956
Lets get 'em.

313
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,329
Full speed ahead, Karoo!

314
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,131
[squaks]

315
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,968
Hey, wait! I'm not on yet!

316
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,770
Slow down, Karoo! Let me on!

317
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:06,138
Hey, bird, do you hear me?

318
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:06,739
Let me on!

319
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,474
[squaks]

320
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,076
Just let me on, now!

321
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,248
[USOPP panting]

322
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,483
[USOPP]
Why are you afraid of me?

323
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,685
I thought you were
a duck, not a chicken!

324
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,688
Slow down, will you?!
Please, Karoo!

325
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,796
Miss Golden Week's responsible!

326
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,265
I know that this is your doing!

327
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,502
It's my Colors Trap.

328
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,637
Betrayal Black.

329
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,471
If you touch the paint,

330
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,173
you'll want to
betray your friends,

331
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,042
no matter what they might say.

332
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,811
Even if they beg
and plead for help.

333
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,179
What's she talking about?

334
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,315
I don't understand
what's going on here.

335
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,349
She's a painter.

336
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,518
She uses her paint to
create different emotions.

337
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,186
Each color is a feeling.

338
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,688
[NAMI]
Huh?

339
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,323
Her sense of
color's so complete,

340
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,691
she can manipulate your mind.

341
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,359
Just a splash of
one of her colors,

342
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,628
and you'll be
under her control.

343
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,564
Under her control?!
Well, that's not good.

344
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,534
That simpleminded oaf is
already too easy to control.

345
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,236
The last thing we need is
someone messing with his mind.

346
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,238
Does that mean that all
he needs to do is get away

347
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,240
from the paint
and he'll be okay?

348
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,476
Luffy! Move away
from there, quickly!

349
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,645
[VIVI]
No, don't! Luffy, listen!

350
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,647
Whatever you do,
please don't step outside

351
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,416
the black circle,
all right? I'm begging!

352
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,053
[NAMI]
What are you saying?!

353
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,389
[VIVI] We don't want
you to save us, Luffy.

354
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,524
Please, stay away from us!

355
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,430
No way.

356
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,732
[ZORO]
I get it now.

357
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,767
We just needed to say
the exact opposite

358
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,269
of what we wanted him to do.

359
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,571
Oh, hey!

360
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,209
What... What just happened?
I was acting really strange.

361
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,277
[VIVI]
Luffy! Help us now!

362
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,214
[LUFFY]
Okay! I'm on my way right now!

363

365
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:08,260
Never mind. I just
wanna laugh right now!

366
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,228
Luffy!

367
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,396
Moron!

368
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,231
What now?!

369
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,437
Colors Trap again.

370

stepped out of the circle.

374
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,548
Now it's on his clothing!

375
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,618
Luffy! Quick!
Take off your shirt.

376
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,653
[LUFFY]
I'd love to, really.

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,423
But right now,
I'm too busy laughing.

378
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:41,126
[laughing]

379
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,229
[ZORO grunts]
It's getting bad.

380
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,298
If the wax keeps
falling at this rate,

381
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,934
we'll be lucky to stay
alive for five mintues.

382
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,403
[USOPP, KAROO screaming]

383
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,474
[USOPP, KAROO screaming]

384
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,143
[ZORO] Did you guys come
here just to play tag?!

385
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,247
[USOPP, KAROO scream]

386
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,951
[NAMI]
Look! When Usopp ran into Luffy,

387
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,619
the paint smudged!

388
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,621
[LUFFY panting]

389
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:14,193
[LUFFY] Jeez! What's going on?!
I felt all weird again!

390
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,496
Hey, painter girl!

391
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,465
Would you stop messin'
with me already?!

392
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,333
[MISS GOLDEN WEEK] But you
were having such a good time.

393
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,301
Wasn't it funny?

394
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,703
Well, yeah...
it was kinda funny.

395
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,472
But stop!

396
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,208
I've gotta see about
breaking that pumpkin now.

397
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,676
Gum‐Gum...

398
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,511
[MISS GOLDEN WEEK]
Another Colors Trap!

399
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,379
Time for Bullfight Red!

400
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,816
[LUFFY]
Bazooka!

401
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,518
[ZORO]
What were you aiming at?

402
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,853
I just can't let you break it.

403
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,955
Mr. 3 wouldn't be
happy about that at all.

404
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,623
What'd you do?!

405
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,858
During a bull fight,
a bull can't

406
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,893
control his urge to
attack the red cape.

407
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,695
Likewise, you can't
do anything now

408
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,296
but attack that red circle.

409
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,698
That's what I did.

410
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,699
[screams]

411
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,534
'Kay, that does it!

412
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,369
I'm mad now!

413
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,537
Gum‐Gum...

414
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,340
Bazooka!

415
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:03,909
Having fun?

416
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,245
Aw... Oh, great...

417
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,814
At this rate, he's never
gonna be able to beat her.

418
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,416
Now all of his
strength is useless.

419
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,384
[MISS GOLDEN WEEK]
Now to finish up!

420
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,386
We'll mix the Laughter
Yellow on your back

421
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,688
with some Sadness Blue!

422
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,225
The last Colors Trap:
Tranquil Green.

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,267
Ah... That's some good tea!

00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,836
[NAMI, ZORO, VIVI]
Luffy!

426
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,238
So... What happens now?

427
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,740
See, I told you,
you should have posed,

428
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,875
but you wouldn't listen to me.
And now it's too late.

429
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,377
You're gonna die like that.

430
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,212
Are you really still
talking about that?

431
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,032
Damn. How can they just
keep runnin' like that?

432
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,439
Nose Fancy Double Cannon!

433
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,609
[KAROO squaks]

434
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,446
[USOPP laughs] You missed us,
jerk! Way to go, Karoo!

00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:15,948
[KAROO squaks]

436
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,318
My turn now!

437
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,386
Special Attack: Lead Star!

438
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,291
[USOPP] We need to get back
to Luffy and the others now.

439
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,426
[KAROO squaks]

440
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,797
Chasin' them around
isn't gettin us anywhere.

441
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,232
I noticed.

442
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,572
I hate to use this on
useless pests like them,

443
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,575
but it looks like we may
not have a choice now.

444
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,510
This little beauty
should be quite handy.

445
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,614
A .44 calibur, six‐shot
flintlock revolver.

446
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,783
It's a new model out
of the South Blue.

447
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,785
Continuous fire.

448
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,521
And when I shoot it,
the bullets are invisible.

449
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,259
[USOPP] When Luffy was acting
so strange back there,

450
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,694
those two agents mentioned
something about paint.

451
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,697
The paint must have something
to do with Luffy's behavior!

452
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,599
There was also some
yellow paint on his back

453
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,501
when we crashed
into him earlier.

454
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,969
That's gotta be the key!

455
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,771
We just have to do
something about the paint

456
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,273
before it's too late!

457
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:14,873
