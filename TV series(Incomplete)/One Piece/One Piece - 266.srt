1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,804
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,606
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,343
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,718
That's why I think you should
stay behind once we get there.

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,852
Give us five minutes,

6
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,388
then charge through to the
main island in Rocketman.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,524
The Franky Family and
Galley-La will go in first

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:26,093
and break open the Main Gate
and the Main Island Front Gate

9
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,528
so the train can
pass right through.

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,797
Our best chance is for you
Straw Hats to concentrate

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,133
on CP9 and leave the
rest of the marines to us.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:33,667
Right.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,001
I got it.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,376
What?

15
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,778
Why the hell is he
going in on his own!

16
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,415
That crazy Straw Hat didn't
understand the plan at all!!

17
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,016
Bring it on, pirate!

18
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,636
I'm in a hurry.

19
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,538
But you'll have more
people to fight later!

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,572
See ya!

21
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,461
Don't let them open that gate!

22
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,396
Fire!

23
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,163
Shut up!

24
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:40,134
Move it!

25
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,168
All right men, let's go!

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,009
We made it through
the main gate!

27
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,551
By the way, Sniper King.

28
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,322
Hey!

29
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,523
That hurt!

30
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,757
You think you could
teach me how to use

31
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,293
the cold air feature
on this thing?

32
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:06,827
Sure.

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,262
It's simple--I mean.

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,763
Why are you asking me?

35
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,436
I hate waiting.

36
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,171
I hope everyone's okay.

37
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,041
All we can do is
be patient, Chopper.

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,576
Even if Luffy jumped the gun,

39
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,212
we gotta sit tight
and stick with the plan.

40
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,634
These pipsqueaks
don't look like much.

41
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,535
C'mon.

42
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,203
You wanna get back
to bed soon, right?

43
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,272
Let's make this quick.

44
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,339
Sounds good.

45
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:52,873
Whoa.

46
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,009
They-they're giants!

47
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,412
Hey, Straw Hat Luffy.

48
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,548
How many friends did
you bring with you, huh?

49
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:07,187
We've got 10,000 soldiers
here at Enies Lobby!

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,223
Sorry, but it's just me.

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,395
Now get out of my way!

52
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,119
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

53
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,587
[LUFFY READS ALOUD]

54
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,039
This is a dead end,
little twerps!

55
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,114
This is your last chance to
turn around and go home.

56
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,649
One more step
and we'll stomp you!

57
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,799
We can't turn back now!

58
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,601
Just remember,
our Big Bro's waiting

59
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,203
on the other side of that gate!

60
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,779
Our bro Franky wouldn't
give up at a time like this,

61
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,715
and neither will we!

62
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,322
Don't give in!

63
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,657
We gotta clear the
way for Rocketman!

64
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,366
Bust down those doors!

65
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,240
Forget about it--I won't even
let an ant through this gate!

66
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,149
The Destroyers!

67
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,684
What happened?

68
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,785
You bastards.

69
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,321
Took out our strongest guys
before I even got here!

70
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,589
You'll pay!

71
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,132
What is that?

72
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,233
Zambai!

73
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:13,734
Kiwi!

74
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,468
Mozu!

75
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,203
Galley-La!

76
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,508
Sorry we're late!

77
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,710
Took a little longer
than I thought

78
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,646
to get Sodom and
Gomorrah ready for land!

79
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,714
Zambai!

80
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,316
They beat the Destroyers!

81
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,385
Yeah, I know.

82
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,821
But we don't have time
to patch them up right now.

83
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,590
The only thing that matters
is getting through that gate.

84
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,225
We came here to
rescue our big bro

85
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,727
and that's just
what we're gonna do!

86
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,472
Let's rock.

87
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,373
Yeah!

88
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,610
We'll send those
big lugs crashing down!

89
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,544
Come on!

90
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,512
You got it, Kiwi!

91
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,622
Here we go!

92
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,723
Hull Dismantler.

93
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,725
Slash!

94
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,496
Rope Action.

95
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,564
Timber Hitch Tug!

96
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,712
Kashii no!

97
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,352
Tilestone!

98
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,202
Treenail Lock!

99
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,504
It's a job well done!

100
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,217
Little runts!

101
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,319
I'll crush you!

102
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,394
Kashii!

103
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:30,003
All right!

104
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,609
How dare you.

105
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,044
Don't let up, men!

106
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,746
We got one more to go!

107
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,614
Yeah!

108
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,623
What's the current status?

109
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,557
Sir.

110
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,725
Well, Kashii and Oimo
should be dealing

111
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,095
with the intruders at the
main island gate right now.

112
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,097
I don't suspect they're
having any trouble.

113
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,365
Naturally.

114
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,067
But what about Straw Hat?

115
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,635
Where are we at on that one?

116
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,771
"Where are we at?" Ah.

117
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:08,375
This is just an estimate,
but I'd say about four hundred?

118
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,144
Four Hundred?

119
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,545
What're you talking about?

120
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,713
Our casualties, sir!

121
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,589
You're not making
any sense, man!

122
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:25,326
You're telling me Straw Hat
has defeated 400 of our guards?

123
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,462
Looks like we lost about
a hundred more just now.

124
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,763
No, that number's wrong.

125
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,365
I'll correct it, sir.

126
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,466
You'd better!

127
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,401
Our guards are well-trained.

128
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,271
I'll be damned if one man
could take that many out!

129
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,241
If we have casualties,
at least report them properly!

130
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,180
Right.

131
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,083
Then allow me to report again.

132
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,418
I'd estimate our current
casualties at five--

133
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,457
Five men?

134
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,659
We've only lost
five of our guards?

135
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,860
Jeez!

136
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,329
How in the world could you
make such an obvious mistake!

137
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,664
Five hundred.

138
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,203
Seems Straw Hat's
no threat after all.

139
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:12,506
He's just running around the
island, making a lot of noise.

140
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,041
Well, that's no surprise.

141
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,309
Even he's not stupid enough

142
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,711
to take on that many
guards on his own.

143
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:21,248
Either way, it's only a matter
of time before he's captured.

144
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,585
Good to see you all back.

145
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:27,554
Chief, Mr. Lucci's
party has arrived.

146
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,590
Excellent!

147
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,058
Well, what are you waiting for?

148
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,592
Show them in already.

149
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,070
It's been quite a while, Chief.

150
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,404
Hasn't it?

151
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,643
As promised, we've
brought Cutty Flam--

152
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:24,445
the criminal responsible
for assaulting

153
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,648
government officials in
Water Seven, 8 years ago.

154
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:28,649
And of course.

155
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:30,451
We also have Nico Robin,

156
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,553
the last surviving
resident of Ohara.

157
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,689
Who we've been trying to capture
for the past two decades.

158
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,460
They're both waiting outside
if you would like to see them.

159
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:42,296
In short, the mission
was a huge success.

160
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,565
It's good to have you back.

161
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,466
Lucci.

162
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,367
Kaku.

163
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,334
Blueno.

164
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,502
Kalifa.

165
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,436
That's harassment.

166
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,504
All I did was say your name!

167
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,512
Just like old times, huh, Lucci?

168
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,682
Actually, I think that you might
be even more smug than before.

169
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,819
But sadly, you're
not any smarter, Jabra.

170
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,255
What?

171
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,189
Oh, come on!

172
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,257
We've hardly even
gotten off of the train

173
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,693
and the first thing you
two do is start bickering?

174
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,594
Yoyoi!

175
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,462
Kaakuu is riiiiight!

176
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:20,067
Can't we alllll
just get aloooong?!

177
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,507
Fooor fiiive loooong years we've
awaaaaited theiiir reeetuuurn!

178
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,087
Chapapa.

179
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,289
Cha -papa cha-pa.

180
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,429
Ow.

181
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:52,733
I had a feeling you were going
to test us right away, Fukurou.

182
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:56,303
Six Powers Skill-Competition!

183
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,206
I'll use an armed guard as
reference for the ranking.

184
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,808
Let's say they're about a ten.

185
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,277
So your power levels are.

186
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,146
Ohhh, interesting,
very interesting.

187
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,281
Let's see here.

188
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:08,449
First is Kalifa.

189
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:10,417
Power level six hundred thirty.

190
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,787
Blueno is eight-hundred twenty.

191
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,091
Kaku is two-thousand,
two hundred.

192
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,226
And Lucci.

193
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,164
Power level 4000!

194
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,299
4000?

195
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,134
You gotta be making
these numbers up!

196
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,270
There's no such thing as
a power level that high!

197
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:30,738
Cha pa pa!

198
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:35,209
Well, maybe not before now,
but they've gotten stronger!

199
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,811
Since I measured
Jabra and Kumadori too.

200
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:42,148
I can finally rank all of CP9!

201
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,622
No way, Fukurou,
I want a recount!

202
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,391
Even if I ignore
the whole Lucci thing,

203
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,326
why the hell am
I weaker than Kaku!

204
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,794
'Because Cha pa pa!

205
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:57,364
Kaku got stronger
too, that's why!

206
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,733
I don't want you getting
a big head over this Kaku.

207
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,735
Just remember, the
"Competition" technique

208
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,637
only measures your
physical strength!

209
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,704
In a real battle,

210
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,308
I have my devil fruit powers
to help me out, too.

211
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,344
I can trash a guy like you
any day of the week, got it?

212
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,545
I don't care.

213
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,782
If it makes you feel better,
keep telling yourself that.

214
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:15,916
Exactly.

215
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,753
Don't pay any heed to the
yapping of that mangy dog.

216
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:23,591
So, I'm a mangy dog, am I?

217
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,526
Screw you, cat bastard.

218
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:35,135
Honestly!

219
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,804
Both of you, stop it!

220
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:39,540
Jabra certainly is
touchy today, isn't he?

221
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,108
Did something happen to him?

222
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,777
All the guards on the
island are talking about it!

223
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,779
Jabra's been in a bad mood
'cause he got dumped

224
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,083
by that waitress,
Gatherine the other day.

225
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,417
So that's it.

226
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,052
Hey, now hold on a sec!

227
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,355
That's a secret-why do
people know about that!

228
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:57,691
'Cause I told everyone here
how sad and lonely you are!

229
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:58,626
Chapapa!

230
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,361
I should've known!

231
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:05,633
Geez!

232
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,334
This is what you get for doing

233
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,737
that stupid ranking
nonsense right off the bat!

234
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,338
There's hardly any
point in bickering

235
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,641
over who's strongest when
your Six Powers training

236
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,143
has made you all superhuman.

237
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,680
Power Level 500 should be
more than anyone needs, right?

238
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,650
He's saying that
cause he's level 9.

239
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:25,052
Even weaker than
a guard, chapapa!

240
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,119
Who cares!

241
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,489
You guys are the muscle--I
just give the orders!

242
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:31,525
Besides, I have my special
sword to use in a pinch.

243
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,392
It's all right, Chief.

244
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,661
We've always known
how weak you are.

245
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,698
Come on now, Kalifa.

246
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,801
There's no need to
be so blunt about it!

247
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,136
That's sexual harassment.

248
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:42,770
What?

249
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,738
Because I replied to you?

250
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,641
By the way.

251
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,776
Huh?

252
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:49,777
What now?

253
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,112
That's sexual harassment.

254
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,681
My existence?

255
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:54,648
Yoiyoi!

256
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,683
Kalifa!

257
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:59,620
You are showing very poor form!

258
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:03,557
Allow me to apologiiize,
deaaar chiiief.

259
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,560
By putting this
blade to my belly!

260
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,062
Seppuku!

261
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,596
Iron Body!

262
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:13,099
I can't even die right.

263
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,104
If you wanna die that bad,
I'd be happy to help!

264
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,441
Or perhaps it is your
love that protects me.

265
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,077
Dear mother in heaven.

266
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,412
Is it not my time?

267
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,614
I see now.

268
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,116
I never knew you
lost your mother.

269
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,318
We have long fought,

270
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,622
but now we can find solace
in each other's plights.

271
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:35,489
Yeah.

272
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,491
Despite all the
cruel things I've said,

273
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,059
I understand your pain!

274
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:43,530
I know what it feels
like to lose a loved one!

275
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,165
Oh, Mother, dear!

276
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,800
Gatherine!

277
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,336
Am I not good enough for you?

278
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,238
I miss you!

279
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:56,644
Chief.

280
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:57,311
Uh.

281
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,480
Yes?

282
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,382
Their play is over.

283
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,616
We can continue.

284
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,784
Oh, right.

285
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,527
Although it's been a long time
coming, needless to say,

286
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,830
I'm extremely pleased with your
performance in this mission.

287
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:19,800
Of course, it's fantastic
that you've caught Nico Robin,

288
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,635
but catching that
bastard Cutty Flam

289
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,238
is the icing on the cake for me.

290
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,774
It's no exaggeration when
I say that the entire world

291
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,678
will praise your efforts when
word of this finally gets out.

292
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,080
Let me tell you, as your
Commander in Chief,

293
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,816
this is one of the proudest
moments in my life,

294
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,786
and I mean that.

295
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,020
By the way.

296
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:43,290
Although it isn't exactly a
reward for all your hard work.

297
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,260
I do have something
I want to give you.

298
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:49,530
Well, we can take
care of that later.

299
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:53,133
For now, let's
meet them, shall we?

300
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,569
The hope of the entire world.

301
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,629
You ready, ladies and gents?

302
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,831
The time has finally arrived.

303
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,833
If they don't have
those gates open by now,

304
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,268
it ain't gonna happen!

305
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,104
Hurry up and go!
Hurry up and go!

306
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:05,306
Meow!

307
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:06,607
I'm gonna need you to take out

308
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,543
that iron fence,
okay Samurai Man?

309
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:11,244
Just leave it to me.

310
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,585
That hurts!

311
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:18,552
Hurry up!

312
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,687
There's no time!

313
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,022
We gotta open that gate!

314
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,227
Keep moving!

315
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,628
Go!

316
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:38,572
Wait, where am I?

317
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,107
This street sure is
a pain to walk on!

318
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,745
Ah!

319
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,317
Damn it, Robin, I'm coming!

320
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,253
Just you wait!

321
00:20:52,286 --> 00:20:55,522
I'm not gonna let you
leave my crew that easy!

322
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,424
Look! He's over there!

323
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,525
Gum-Gum...

324
00:20:58,558 --> 00:20:59,559
Capture him!

325
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,063
Yo-yo!

326
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,352
The Commander in
Chief will see you now.

327
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,621
Both of you go inside.

328
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,496
Hey, Moss-for-Brains!

329
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,064
What's going on out here?

330
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,800
They uh... They
closed the main gate.

331
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,669
They what??

332
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:23,637
This is bad! We're gonna crash!

333
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,372
Don't worry. I have a plan.

334
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,107
All right, Zoro!

335
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,742
We'll Just leave it to luck.

336
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,144
We're gonna die!

337
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,645
On the next One Piece:

338
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,647
"Find A Way Out!
Rocketman

339
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,484
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
