00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,835
Are you telling me you
don't need the Navy's aid?

179
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:05,770
Yes.

180
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:08,439
This whole prison is
a labyrinthine hell.

181
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,441
If you don't know
your way around in here,

182
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:12,243
you'll be of no help to us.

183
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,311
[SADIE]
That being said,

184
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,782
if you wish to serve us,
you can guard the outside.

185
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:19,984
[SADIE] This drawbridge
is the only entrance.

186
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,386
We'll secure ourselves
inside, raise it and...

187
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,057
[SADIE moans] ...seal off
Impel Down completely!

188
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,825
We'll do our job.

189
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,194
And as long as you
do yours, nobody...

190
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:33,965
{SADIE moans] ...will escape
from this prison alive.

191
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,133
Fair enough.

192
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,502
We'll remain here and
guard the gate, then.

193
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,072
There. That's a good boy.

194
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:45,276
Is that a...?

195
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,980
No way...

196
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,514
Koala?

197
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,351
A koala?

198
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,052
Sure is.

199
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,546
[DAIGIN] Impel Down is
now completely sealed off.

200
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,983
Huh?

201
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,724
[DAIGIN]
A koala?

202
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,594
[footsteps]

203
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,204
[PRISONER 432A]
Hannyabal?

204
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,072
Yeah, and Magellan's here, too.

205
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,574
What's goin' on?

206
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,475
Hmm...

207
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,754
[HANNYABAL] You've got
a special visitor, Ace.

208
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,288
Behave yourself.

209
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,492
You'll never guess who it is.

210
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,127
Jimbei.

211
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,395
[HANNYABAL]
You know her well,

212
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,430
but even you've never met her.

213
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,732
Maybe I should give
Ace here a hint?

214
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:10,102
Her name is notorious,
but she never shows herself.

215
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,139
She leads a tribe of
warriors called the Kuja.

216
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,208
And she's one of
the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

217
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,245
Strong, noble, and the most
beautiful woman in the world!

218
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,314
The Pirate Empress, Boa Hancock!

219
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,050
Hmm?

220
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,287
Yay! It's Hancock!

221
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,722
Check her out!

222
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,491
Hey, quick question:
When I become Warden

223
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,394
will you do me the honor
of being my beautiful bride?

224
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,463
Marry me!

225
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,198
Ouch!

226
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,833
When I'm warden,
I'll hit on her all I want.

227
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,402
I mean, sorry Warden,
you can hit me all you want.

228
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,671
That's enough of
your tomfoolery!

229
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,840
Wooo! Holy crap!

230
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,742
Guys, am I seeing things?

231
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,876
She's gorgeous!

232
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,878
[PRISONER 432D] So she's
the Snake Princess of the Kuja?

233
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,780
Hey! Move a little closer!

234
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,716
[PRISONER 432E]
Turn around, Hancock!

235
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,485
[PRISONER 432F]
Yeah, That is some choice meat!

236
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,554
[PRISONER 432G]
Hey, hot stuff!

237
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,621
Come to our cell!

238
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,123
We'll give you
some tender lovin'

240

[PRISONER 432H]
Damn! She smells amazing!

241
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,563
If I ever get out of here,

242
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,898
I'm goin' straight
to Amazon Lily!

243
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,768
[PRISONER 432I] I heard
it's full of hot naked chicks!

244
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,437
Count me in!

00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:25,745
[PRISONERS chanting]

246
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,447
What is it?
What do you want from me?

247
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,749
Nothing, really.

248
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,451
I simply wanted to take
a good look at you.

249
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,888
To see the cause of the war
I will take part in first-hand.

250
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,523
That's all.

251
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,259
[ACE] Am I everything
you'd hoped for?

Come on, Hancock!

254
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,832
Don't ignore us like that!

[PRISONER 432L]
Get over here and gimme some!

[PRISONER 432L laughs]

257
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,272
In the past, you've
always been the empress

258
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,908
who stood her ground
and disobeyed every summons.

259
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,744
Yet you're going to
take part in this war?

260
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,849
[JIMBEI chuckles] I hope your
title is worth your dignity!

261
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,417
A pleasure to meet you, too.

262

Now mind your foolish tongue.

lick her everywhere!

Can it, Magellan!

267
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,428
Or should I say "Diarrhea Man"?

Nice one!

I bet the women on your island
are hungry for guys like us!

with those coarse voices.

you "Diarrhea Man."

with it? It's disgraceful.

00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,239
Huh? You mean Luffy?!

352
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,775
The one with the straw hat that
you're always talking about?

353
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,277
That fool.

354
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:07,553
[LUFFY panting]

355
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,754
Aw, man!

356
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,923
When the heck did
I start going upstairs?

357
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,691
I wanna go downstairs!

358
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,359
Well, if it started going up,

359
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,528
it'll probably go back down
again sooner or later.

360
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,030
I'm getting hungry!

361
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,665
[GUARD 432A]
I've got an image of him!

362
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,467
And it appears he's about
to enter District C!

363
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,435
[LUFFY panting]

364
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,003
Right. We see him.

365
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:29,942
[LUFFY panting]

366
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,743
[LUFFY yells]

367
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,785
They're using
Sea Prism Stone nets again!

368
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,489
Oof!

369
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,623
[LUFFY grunts]

370
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,858
Ahh!

371
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,593
Close one!

372
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,629
[LUFFY gasps]

373
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,997
[LUFFY grunts]

374
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,567
[SPHINX grunts]

375
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,669
[LUFFY] Aw crap!
It's that lion-thing!

376
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,771
[LUFFY grunts]

377
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,741
--[SPHINX roars]
--[LUFFY yells]

378
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,844
Hey! Let him go!

379
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,655
[SPHINX]
Huh?

380
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,391
Need a hand, pal?

381
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,694
Hey! Zoro!

382
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,672
Ha-ha! Fooled ya!

383
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,542
[BON CLAY]
Swan. Arabesque!

384
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,077
[SPHINX grunts]

385
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,415
[BON CLAY giggles]

386
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,318
Swan! Swan!

387
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,053
Huh?

388
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,461
That is not Zoro.

389
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,497
But he does sound familiar.

390
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,833
Been a while, Straw Boy!

391
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,403
Did you miss me, old pal?

392
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,706
[LUFFY yells]

393
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,043
[BON CLAY]
And twirl open plie!

394
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:15,080
Well, did everyone enjoy
my very special secret talent?

395
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,114
[ALL]
Oh, yeah!

396
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,684
[ALL singing]

397
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,452
[BON CLAY]
Running now would go against

398
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,688
everything Bon Clay stands for.

399
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,490
If we abandon allies
who are risking their lives

400
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,461
to pick up a friend, could we
live with ourselves tomorrow?

401
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,031
[MARINE A] Miss Hina! The
enemy ships are splitting up!

402
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,133
[BON CLAY] You must be feeling
pretty stupid right now,

403
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,668
falling for such
a simple trick!

404
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,571
See, we're masters
of disguise!

405
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,009
As well as friends
to the Straw Hats!

406
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,412
Bring it on, sister!

407
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,148
[LUFFY crying]
I promise you, Bon Clay!

408
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,385
We will never forget you!

409
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,422
It's Bon!

410
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,490
I'd still rather have Zoro,

411
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,494
but I'm glad you're alive
after all that happened!

412
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,630
Take aim!
Open fire on Straw Hat!

413
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,864
[BON CLAY]
Piss off!

414
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:06,832
[GUARDS]
Huh?

415
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,767
[GUARDS yell]

416
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,468
Bastards!

417
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,836
You stay away from my friend,

418
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,872
or things are about
to get very ugly!

419
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,113
Good boy, Sphinx!
Now, take them out!

420
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,219
[SALDEATH yells]

421
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,820
[LUFFY] There.
After a beating like that,

422
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,123
he shouldn't be
bothering us anymore.

423
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,158
[BON CLAY] Sometimes when
you're dealing with an animal,

424
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,794
you have to teach it
the law of the jungle!

425
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,962
[BON CLAY giggles]

426
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,897
Fried noodles.

427
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,033
[LUFFY cries]

428
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,801
You really bailed
us out last time,

429
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,603
and I thought for
sure you were dead!

430
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,905
Am I ever happy to see you!

431
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,907
[BON CLAY cries]

432
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,143
Oh, stop pulling my tail!

433
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,712
You know swans never die!

434
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,147
Unless that isn't true.

435
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,585
[BON CLAY crying]

436
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,623
[NARRATOR] And now a reminder
of how Bon Clay's power works.

437
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,058
He ate the Clone-Clone Fruit,

438
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,060
allowing him to
transform into anyone

439
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,595
whose face he's touched
with his right hand.

440
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,064
He was able to turn into Zoro

441
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,799
because he had
touched him before,

442
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,068
but he is not able
to mimic his strength.

443
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,172
[BON CLAY crying]

444
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,841
Now there's another
escapee to deal with.

445
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:23,975
The deeper the
Straw Hat descends,

446
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,112
the more friends he seems
to pick up along the way.

447
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,982
Blugori!

448
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,652
I don't care what it takes,
don't let them escape!

449
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,188
[BLUGORI grunt]

450
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,023
Hmm?

451
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,862
Oh, and by the way.

452
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,199
I heard that you wanted to go
all the way down to Level 5!

453
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,068
That's the plan, but I could use
a guide if you're not too busy.

454
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,204
[BON CLAY] Wouldn't have it
any other way, my friend.

455
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,338
As fate would have it,

456
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,975
there's someone down on Level 5
I'd like to see, too!

457
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,143
Really?

458
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,713
Now, then. Shall we go?

459
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,849
[LUFFY]
Let's do it!

460
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,118
[BON CLAY]
Uh-huh!

461
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,761
[NARRATOR]
Teaming up with Bon Clay,

462
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,296
Luffy races from
Level 3 to Level 4

463
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,833
pummeling every Blugori that
dares to stand in their path.

464
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,136
But all good things
must come to an end,

465
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,937
and a powerful
demon guard, Minotarus,

466
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,607
is ready to do some
pummeling of his own.

467
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,841
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

468
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:34,146
"Warden Magellan's Strategy
Straw Hat Entrapment Completed!"

469
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,548
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
