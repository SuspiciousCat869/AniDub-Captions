Board!

178
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,989
[hammering]

179
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,489
[USOPP]
Board.

180
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,324
[CHOPPER]
Board!

181
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,577
[hammering]

182
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,077
[USOPP]
Board.

183
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,662
[CHOPPER]
Board!

184
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,788
[USOPP]
Argh!

185
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,457
Bo...

186
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,171
Seriously.
I know say this all the time,

187
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,715
but one thing I am not
is a ship repairman.

188
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,507
[CHOPPER]
But you're really good

189
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,675
at doing this sort
of thing, Usopp.

190
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,471
I know! It's quite amazing.
I'm incredibly versatile.

191
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,640
I say we trash this
and buy a new ship instead.

192
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,766
[USOPP]
Are you out of your mind?

193
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,685
Do you have any idea how
we got our hands on this ship?

194
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah, yeah.

195
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,355
I've heard it a thousand times.

196
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,397
It was given to you

197
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,566
by the most gorgeous girl
in your village, right?

198
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,692
Who cares?

199
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,736
It's just plain dangerous
to keep relying on a ship

200
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,695
in this condition.

201
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,781
[USOPP] That's why
I'm repairing it, idiot!

202
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,158
Now get down here
and give us a hand!

203
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,159
Repairs, huh?

204
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,327
This?

205
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,371
It won't hold.

206
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,538
Bite me!

207
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,582
Ha! That face is
hilarious, Usopp!

208
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,292
[USOPP]
Oh, you mean this one?

209
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,252
Bite me!

210
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,130
What a couple of idiots.

211
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,715
You guys have any
ideas about dinner?

212
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,801
Bite me!

213
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,469
[SANJI]
Fine, no food for you.

214
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
[USOPP]
No, we wanna eat!

215
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,264
[SANJI] I better check to see
how that seagull soup is doing.

216
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,184
I wonder if I could use
the feathers as a garnish.

217
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,060
That could be interesting.

218
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,399
[PIRATES]
Salvage! Salvage the sea!

219
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,860
Salvage!

220
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,196
Huh. There's something
strange with that ship.

221
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,535
[USOPP, CHOPPER]
I know that song!

222
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,777
[USOPP]
L‐Luffy! Zoro!

223
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,863
What happened?
Why are you bleeding?

224
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,322
[SANJI]
Nami! Oh no!

225
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,741
Are you all right?

226
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,284
[CHOPPER]
Doctor!

227
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,410
[USOPP]
You're the doctor!

228
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,661
Go check them out already!

229
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,371
[CHOPPER]
Ow! Right.

230
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,417
[USOPP]
So what happened to you guys?

231
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,296
It looks like you were mauled
by a pack of rabid wolves.

232
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,505
It was pirates.

233
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,423
But we're okay.

234
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
Just some scratches.

235
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,633
Yup.

236
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,552
You guys seem to be
okay with everything,

237
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,512
but I certainly am not.

238
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,680
What's wrong with you two?

239
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,598
You are men, right?

240
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,807
When someone provokes you,

241
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,642
the only logical response
would be to pummel their faces

242
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,561
and wipe up the blood
with their friends' faces!

243
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
Or better yet,

244
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,939
you should have blown up
the entire, annoying town!

245
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,233
What happened to
all the pacifist talk?

246
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,736
Ugh! Shut up, Zoro!
What's past is past!

247
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,363
We're not talking about
ancient history here!

248
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,282
Hey, why is she
in such a bad mood?

249
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,992
She didn't get a
single scratch on her.

250
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,453
Huh. Beats me.

251
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,496
Oh, yeah!

252
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,790
Did you get any information
about sky island?

253
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,417
Sky island...?

254
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,295
Does it even matter anymore?

255
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,506
All I did was say
the words "sky island."

256
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,257
And they all laughed at me.

257
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,552
What the heck was so
funny about me saying that?

258
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,887
Bunch of jerks.

259
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,514
I am the ketchup star.

260
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,766
Guard Point!

261
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,976
It sounds like I missed out
on some excitement here.

262
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,269
How's everyone doing?

263
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,396
[SANJI]
Robin! Welcome back my love!

264
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,565
I can draw a bath and
prepare a fruit plate for you

265
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
if you're interested!

266
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,526
Hey there, Robin.

267
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,694
Where have you
been all day, huh?

268
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,239
Well, I went shopping
for clothes

269
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,949
and found some
information on Skypiea.

270
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,617
That's right. You're
the one who brought it up!

271
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,453
I was made to look like an
idiot thanks to your big mouth!

272
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,413
Trust me, if this place
turns out to not exist,

273
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,291
I'll throw you overboard
with rocks in your pockets!

274
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,836
Robin, I'd kind of keep
my distance if I were you.

275
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,754
At least for the next two hours.

276
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,590
Just don't rock the boat,
know what I'm saying?

277
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,510
[ROBIN]
Here you go, Captain.

278
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,762
Ooh, thanks, Robin!

279
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,930
Looks like a normal map.

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,931
So what's the big deal?

281
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,641
[ROBIN]
It's this island.

282
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,727
On the left side is Mock Town,
which is where we are now.

283
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,271
And if you look
on the other side,

284
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,981
you'll see an X on the coast.

285
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,692
Supposedly a man lives
there that was banished

286
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,777
from this town because
he didn't blend in.

287
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,529
"Didn't blend in"?

288
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,991
[ROBIN]
His name is Montblanc Cricket.

289
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,411
Apparently, Mr. Cricket talked
about his dreams too much.

290
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,746
Sounds like you have
something in common.

291
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,458
We need to pay this guy a visit.

292
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,626
Wait a second, Luffy.

293
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,879
It might not be such
a good idea to do that.

294
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,547
At least not now.

295
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,799
Wouldn't you agree, Chopper?

296
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,846
What the heck
happened to you two?

297
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,806
I thought I was a goner!

298
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,766
[ZORO]
You are such a pain.

299
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,894
[CHOPPER]
But Nami was freaking out!

300
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,936
[NAMI]
What did you say?

301
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,647
Wait a second, you better
not be laughing at me!

302
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,066
[CHOPPER]
No! Of course not!

303
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,448
[DIVER A] Captain! All undersea
preparations are operational!

304
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,657
[DIVER B]
Microphone ready!

305
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,869
[SHOJO] Excellent.
Initiate the search sonar!

306
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:20,002
[wails]

307
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,821
[DIVER C] This is
Utan Diver Number 27!

308
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,406
Sonar response confirmed.

309
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,825
We've detected a
school of fish at nine o'clock!

310
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,828
Judging from their speed,
we're looking at saury fish!

311
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,123
Yeah! Time for a fish fry!

312
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,416
[DIVER D]
Diver four here!

313
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,876
Sonar response confirmed!

314
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,880
A small sailing vessel has
been detected on the surface!

315
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,757
Excuse me? A vessel?

316
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,593
Determine the exact
direction it's traveling!

317
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,095
[DIVER D]
It's dead ahead, sir!

318
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,888
Twelve o'clock!

319
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,725
[SHOJO] It's already close
enough for visual contact?

320
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,895
Cancel the search and
return to the ship at once!

321
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,782
Well, it didn't take us long
to run into something weird.

322
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,868
Do you think it's that same
salvage boat from before?

323
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,744
Or...

324
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,579
Nah, it might look
like a similar ship,

325
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,415
but it's not Masira's group.

326
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,792
Yeah, cause Chopper
and I saw those guys.

327
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,459
Right?

328
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
Right. We saw them docking.

329
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,879
Turns out they port
at Mock Town the same

330
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,506
as most ships in these waters.

331
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,591
They're greedy slime
just like all the others.

332
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,718
You know those
guys better hope

333
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,970
we don't run into them again.

334
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,472
[SHOJO]
Hey‐ey‐ey, you guys!

335
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,766
Shut your traps
and pay attention!

336
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,019
[DIVERS whoop]

337
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,730
[SHOJO]
Ha!

338
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,149
Can you believe I actually
got all worked up wondering

339
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,984
who you people were?

340
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,320
[LUFFY]
Your face looks weird.

341
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,989
What species are you?

342
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,532
I'm human, moron!

343
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,993
Are you telling us you
don't know who Shojo is?

344
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,870
He's only the captain
of the Shojo Pirates

345
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,164
and the world's leader
in undersea search!

346
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,958
I wouldn't make our boss
angry if I were you!

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,877
Hey! Now, now.

348
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:25,961
Hold on.

349
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,339
Huh.. It looks like we're
in the same profession.

350
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,342
Were you aware that Crocodile,
who is one of the Seven Warlords

351
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,012
of the Sea,
was defeated recently?

352
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,264
When you consider
my dominating abilities,

353
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,475
that open spot is
as good as mine.

354
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,477
I've been doing
my best to stay patient,

355
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,189
but lately the anticipation
has gotten the best of me.

356
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,231
[LUFFY]
So your goal is to become

357
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,358
one of the Seven
Warlords of the Sea?

358
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,568
[SHOJO]
Didn't I just say that?

359
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,196
In any case, since you're
obviously not a threat to me,

360
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,031
so let's get to know
each other personally.

361
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,199
I'll start.

362
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,534
Did you know I haven't had
my hair cut in my entire life?

363
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,328
That's over 25 years!

364
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,204
You're impressed?

365
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,206
And jealous. Admit it!

366
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,332
That's lame.

367
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,167
[gasps]
How dare you!

368
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,293
Watch your mouth, kid!

369
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,253
[SHOJO]
Settle down, my faithful divers.

370
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,589
I'm not going to let
these foul‐mouthed punks

371
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,549
get away with insulting me.

372
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,759
Take this to heart.

373
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,179
Sail through the tunnel that is
my rage and you will be met

374
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,058
by a sea of blood from
which you'll never escape!

375
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
[LUFFY]
Yeah, whatever.

376
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,229
Move aside, we have places
to go and people to meet.

377
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,356
You just don't get it, do you?

378
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,316
This is my turf,
and if you want to pass,

379
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,360
you'll either pay
the toll or be sunk!

380
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,152
Got it?

381
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,154
What's this guy
mean by his turf?

382
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,406
He's starting to sound
like our old friend Masira.

383
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,659
Huh? Masira said
stuff like that?

384
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,119
[SHOJO]
What? Masira?

385
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,579
What about Masira?

386
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,499
[LUFFY] If you must know we
kicked his butt off our boat,

387
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,083
but we didn't think‐‐

388
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,418
You what? Kicked him?

389
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,586
[DIVERS]
Easy, boss!

390
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,089
No! How dare you lay

391
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,590
‐‐a hand on my brother!
‐‐Wait, hold on.

392
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,758
Listen to me.

393
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,387
Sure we threw him off our boat,
but I bet he's alive.

394
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,180
[SHOJO wails]

395
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,934
Havoc Sonar!

396
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:13,360
[wails]

397
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
[LUFFY gasps]

398
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,618
The ship!

399
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,251
So... what are they doing?

400
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,129
[LUFFY]
Who knows? But it's amazing.

401
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,631
He's destroying his
own ship with his voice.

402
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,757
Back to work everyone!

403
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,259
Let's use this to our advantage

404
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,303
and put some distance
between them and us!

405
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,138
[SANJI]
Great idea!

406
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,056
[LUFFY] Look! Nami's
not a demon anymore!

407
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,099
Really?

408
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,058
Well, I would hope
she'd be calmer

409
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,187
after letting off all
that steam earlier.

410
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,563
Huh?

411
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,150
Luffy! We've got trouble!

412
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,151
This isn't good!

413
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,486
The waves are moving
faster than I thought!

414
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,613
Oh great!

415
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,156
The ship's starting
to break apart

416
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,200
right where I made all
those repairs today!

417
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:01,909
Argh!

418
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,702
She's beat up enough already!

419
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,663
If we stay here any longer,
we'll start taking on water!

420
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,165
Full speed ahead!

421
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,750
We need to get out
of his voice's range!

422
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:15,464
[wails]

423
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,078
[PIRATE D] I'm telling you,
it was the strangest thing.

424
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,830
This gorgeous woman walks in,
I mean she was a knockout.

425
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,791
She comes up to me,
and leans over the table

426
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,710
and says, "Tell me where
this man named Cricket lives."

427
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,546
[PIRATE E chuckles]
Sounds like a bold woman.

428
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,258
Bold? No, she was
more like a maniac!

429
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,093
All of a sudden, these
hands started popping out

430
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,220
from her body and knocking
out everyone in the joint.

431
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,639
I'm telling ya,
it really messed with my head.

432
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,436
[PIRATE G]
I'm confused.

433
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:14,147
What does tearing up the bar
have to do with Old Man Cricket?

434
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,190
The sea around here

435
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,609
is the unofficial turf of
those monkey brothers.

436
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,820
But if someone actually
wants to have something

437
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,281
to do with that geezer,
then they must have caught

438
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,490
some of his own stupidity.

439
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,658
[laughs]

440
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,077
[PIRATE G]
And no one wants that.

441
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,247
I bet you what that lady's
really after is his gold.

442
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,456
[PIRATE F]
His gold?

443
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:33,583
[PIRATE G] I heard
they found some recently.

444
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,294
Yeah? Where at?

445
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:35,919
Well‐‐

446
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,838
[BELLAMY]
Hey, guys!

447
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,715
Bellamy!

448
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,093
[BELLAMY] What did
you just say about gold?

449
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,721
This old man that
goes by Cricket.

450
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,765
I'd like to set up
a meeting with him.

451
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,189
What do you know of him?

452
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:00,444

The one we're supposed to see?

468
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,899
[ROBIN]
Montblanc Cricket.

469
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,610
[NAMI] And this book called
"Noland, the Liar" factors

470
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,695
into what we have
to do, I suppose.

471
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,696
[USOPP]
Sounds good.

472
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,948
I sure like the title.

473
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,367

read it a lot when I was a kid.

474
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,701
[NAMI]
Was he a real guy?

475
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,579
[SANJI] Real enough
for a storybook I guess.
