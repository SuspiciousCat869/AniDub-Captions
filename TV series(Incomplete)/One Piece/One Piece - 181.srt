1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,097
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,007
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,972
[ENERU]
What?

25
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:32,434
[WYPER] Are you familiar with
the "Sea Prism Stone", Eneru?

26
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:35,979
[WYPER]
Die!

27
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:37,564
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

28
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:39,941
You're aware of the
consequences, are you not?

29
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:43,069
Your body will pay a
heavy price as well.

30
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:46,614
Why sacrifice yourself for a
homeland you will never regain?

31
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:51,369
If I must... I'll die. Gladly.

32
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:54,080
[WYPER] If it means I
can take you with me!

33
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,123
[gasps]

34
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,916
[ENERU]
Don't do it.

35
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,254
[WYPER]
Reject!

36
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,511
[CHIEFTAIN] Hold our true
ambitions in your heart

37
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:10,263
and speak not of them.

38
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:13,224
We are the weavers of history.

39
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,268
Those are the words
that were written on

40
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:19,439
a Poneglyph 800 years ago.

41
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:21,024
[WYPER]
Poneglyph?

42
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:24,402
[CHIEFTAIN] Yes. And when those
who sought to steal the stone

43
00:03:24,486 --> 00:03:27,572
revealed themselves,
the Shandorian Warriors

44
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:32,452
of the City of Gold fought
bravely to protect it.

45
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,162
[WYPER]
Did they succeed?

46
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,624
Yes. They did. However...

47
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,584
...the battle took its toll.

48
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:43,004
A great many warriors
died that day.

49
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,758
Those few who survived vowed to
become guardians of the stone.

50
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:49,886
They kept watch over the city
and the sacred Poneglyph

51
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,847
they swore to
defend to the death.

52
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:57,560
[WYPER] And you say that's the
true story of our ancestors?

53
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:00,063
But then the island and City
of Gold were taken away

54
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:02,691
to Skypiea 400 years ago.

55
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:05,694
Since then, it's been
under Skypiean control.

56
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,445
[WYPER] Our ancestors
fought to their last breath

57
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,655
to defend that island.

58
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,990
And then it was taken away!

59
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:14,869
The Upper Yard.

60
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,622
That is our homeland,
but at the same time,

61
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:20,291
it alone holds a history
that has disappeared

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,544
into the darkness of time.

63
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:25,630
Even though it's is under the
control of the Skypieans now,

64
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:29,217
we must never allow the fire
of the proud city of Shandora

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,677
to die out.

66
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,974
[WYPER breathes heavily]

67
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:40,562
[LUFFY] "Ambition Toward the
Endless Vearth! The Ark Maxim!"

68
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:51,072
[grunting]

69
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,543
[NAMI gasps]

70
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,211
Robin.

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,674
[NAMI]
Gan Fall!

72
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,134
Oh no...

73
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,762
[gasps]

74
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:22,854
[grunts]

75
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,904
[NAMI]
It can't be.

76
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,325
[NAMI]
He's restarting his own heart!

77
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,083
[gasps]

78
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:53,093
[groans]

79
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:04,312
[ENERU]
It's not that people fear God.

80
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,776
Rather, it is God
who is fear itself.

81
00:06:14,155 --> 00:06:16,282
[ZORO]
What the hell is with this guy?

82
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,576
[chuckles]

83
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,247
[ENERU]
Wyper. I warned you, did I not?

84
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,875
I warned you of
the consequences.

85
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,669
[WYPER grunts]

86
00:06:27,752 --> 00:06:29,504
[WYPER groans]

87
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,715
[ENERU]
And now look where you are.

88
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,263
[ENERU]
How pitiful.

89
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:42,017
[ENERU]
You call yourself a warrior?

90
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,437
[WYPER]
Don't address me...

91
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,063
[ENERU]

92
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:50,025
...as if you know
anything about me!

93
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:58,450
[WYPER]
Eight hundred years ago,

94
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:02,579
proud Shandorian warriors fought
for the fate of this city.

95
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,582
They fought to their
death to protect it.

96
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:09,502
I am a descendant
of those warriors.

97
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:12,797
One day, our homeland
was taken away from us.

98
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,134
For 400 years we've carried
The Great Warrior Kalgara's

99
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:17,510
injured pride.

100
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,554
We've sought to return
our homeland to its

101
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,931
rightful place for generations.

102
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:23,308
And now that...

103
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,769
...I've finally made it...

104
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:32,859
...you're standing...

105
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:36,821
...in... my... way.

106
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,954
[ENERU] I must admit
you landed a good blow.

107
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:50,502
But what a cheap trick,
using that Sea Prism Stone.

108
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:52,379
And on top of that,

109
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:55,965
using a Reject dial should
easily kill the ordinary user.

110
00:07:56,049 --> 00:07:59,636
But you shot it twice and
you're still breathing.

111
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,681
[ENERU scoffs]
Quite impressive.

112
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,267
[grunts]

113
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:10,105
[ENERU] However, you're still
no match for me.

114
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:14,693
[gasps]

115
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:19,698
Is that... a bird?

116
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,912
[ENERU]
Thirty million volt Hino.

117
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,498
[ENERU grunts]

118
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,419
[WYPER gasps, shouts]

119
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:39,509
[yells]

120
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:42,929
[ZORO grunts]

121
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:46,891
[ZORO] So this has a Sea
Prism Stone in it, huh?

122
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:50,979
And now it's your turn,
Swordsman of the Blue Sea.

123
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,232
The only choice now is
to kill or be killed!

124
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,360
[ENERU]
Kiten!

125
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,824
[ZORO grunts, shouts]

126
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,910
[ZORO yells]

127
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:07,912
Zoro!

128
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,470
[NAMI]
I don't believe it!

129
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,430
Even Zoro!

130
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,902
[NAMI]
Everyone... has fallen to him.

131
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:48,745
[gasps]

132
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,663
How could he?

133
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:05,345
[NAMI]
Unreal.

134
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,765
[NAMI]
Even as hurt as he is...

135
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,395
[NAMI]
...he still intends to fight.

136
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:17,273
[ENERU]
What do you hope to prove?

137
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,775
You're going to die anyway.

138
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,486
Why not make it
easy on yourself?

139
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:26,241
Did you say it's been 400 years?

140
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:29,119
For all that time you and the
Shandorians have been fighting

141
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,121
to take back your homeland?

142
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,748
And yet, you are the only
warrior who was managed

143
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,793
to make it here. No wonder
this nation will soon fall

144
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:39,587
to the Blue Sea and be
lost for all eternity.

145
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,381
[NAMI]
How could he do that?

146
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:45,593
[ENERU] You're fighting
for a lost cause.

147
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:48,430
Can't you see that you'll never
regain your homeland?

148
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:49,806
[NAMI]
He's unstoppable!

149
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,267
[ENERU]
So why get back up?

150
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:58,023
For my ancestors.

151
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,866
I must confess I was hoping for
a better answer than that.

152
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,286
But then again, I doubt you're
even completely conscious.

153
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,916
[gasps]

154
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,712
[NAMI]
Look out!

155
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,217
El Thor!

156
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,226
[NAMI shouts]

157
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,915
[gasps]

158
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:09,094
[ENERU] Of all who stood before
me, you are the only one left.

159
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,223
[gasps]

160
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:23,149
[gasps]

161
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,952
[NAMI]
I.... Just hear me out.

162
00:12:35,245 --> 00:12:37,414
[NAMI whimpers]

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,919
[NAMI] I want to....
I want to go with you.

164
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:50,677
I've always wanted to
go to Endless Vearth.

165
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,096
To your dream world.

166
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,519
Can I come with you?

167
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,287
[CHIEFTAIN]
Wyper...

168
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,706
Wyper, come here.

169
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,208
[WYPER]
What is it?

170
00:13:25,545 --> 00:13:27,213
[CHIEFTAIN] Since you
are a descendent of the

171
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:31,634
Great Warrior Kalgara, I feel
I must impart this to you.

172
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:34,971
Not many know the real reason
Kalgara wanted to regain

173
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:38,391
the homeland, and why he would
stop at nothing to do so.

174
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,936
[WYPER] So tell me.
What's the real reason?

175
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,565
[CHIEFTAIN] You see. Kalgara
felt that the loss of his

176
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,485
homeland was his
greatest failure.

177
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:53,531
The problem was, he lost
something else important to him.

178
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,327
[footsteps]

179
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:04,626
What's the matter? Are you
having second thoughts?

180
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,004
[NAMI] I haven't changed
my mind. I'm coming. Hold on!

181
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,217
[NAMI grunts]

182
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,721
That thing? Are you sure you
want to bring it along?

183
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:22,394
[NAMI] Uh, so... you don't
think I'll need it?

184
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,604
Honestly, I'm not certain
you'll be able to use it

185
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:26,189
where we're going.

186
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:29,317
It's up to you.
Do as you please.

187
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,778
[NAMI] Huh. Thanks for
letting me bring it.

188
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,322
I just really like this thing.

189
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:41,079
[NAMI whimpers]

190
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,047
[ENERU] Do you mourn them?

191
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,341
[NAMI gasps]
Uh, no, sir.

192
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,095
Heh. You don't have to put on
such a formal act, you know.

193
00:14:57,178 --> 00:15:00,765
Express yourself, but don't make
the same mistakes as those fools

194
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,144
who couldn't comprehend
the true power of God.

195
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:06,646
They took me too lightly and
so forfeited their lives

196
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,108
in the process. Their failure
was that their minds were not

197
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:11,651
controlled by fear,

198
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,154
and so they were not
prepared for battle with me.

199
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:15,530
Do you understand?

200
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,949
[NAMI]
Yes. I-I suppose so.

201
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:27,125
[NAMI]
I can't let him onto my plan.

202
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,420
I have no choice but to
obey everything he says.

203
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:34,090
An opportunity for escape will
present itself at some point.

204
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:36,468
But until then...

205
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,927
[gasps]

206
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,310
[gasps]

207
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:59,199
[NAMI]
Where is he taking me?

208
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:04,329
[NAMI gasps]

209
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:06,206
Excuse me.

210
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,667
Keep your mouth shut
and follow me.

211
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,878
[gasps]

212
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:31,147
[gasps] What's this?

213
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:39,572
[ENERU] What do you think?
Amazing, isn't it?

214
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:42,117
It's the only ship of
its kind in the world.

215
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,995
And it can only be
controlled by me.

216
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,040
In other words, it's powered
purely by lightning.

217
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,584
[gasps]
Is that even possible?

218
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,546
[ENERU] It's only natural
for you to be skeptical.

219
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:58,425
But I assure you it is possible.
I channel my abundant energy

220
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,260
through a material that
can handle the power

221
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:03,555
and automatically transmit
it throughout the ship.

222
00:17:03,638 --> 00:17:07,017
What material could possibly
withstand that much power?

223
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:11,312
[gasps]

224
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:13,231
That's right.

225
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:16,735
The gold I have harvested from
this island works perfectly.

226
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,863
And I'm sure it will make many
inhabitants of this island

227
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:23,283
happy to see a flying ship
before their demise.

228
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:26,119
The sight of this
magnificent ship in flight

229
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,996
will be the last thing they see.

230
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,664
[ENERU laughs]

231
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:33,626
[NAMI] A flying ship?
I don't believe it!

232
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,086
If it really flies,

233
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,173
I might not have a chance
for escape after all.

234
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,054
Behold the Ark Maxim.

235
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:47,849
With this ship we will reach the
land that knows no boundary.

236
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:50,477
We will travel to the
Endless Vearth.

237
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,272
[ENERU laughs]

238
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:34,437
[AISA, LUFFY, PIERRE scream]

239
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:44,739
[AISA] We're outside.
We finally escaped.

240
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,576
The ground is made
of stone. Where are we?

241
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,039
[LUFFY yells]

242
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:56,167
[AISA grunts]
What going on, Luffy?

243
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,380
Hey, wait up!

244
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,425
[AISA]
Luffy!

245
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:04,968
[PIERRE groans]

246
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,433
We're free!

247
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,602
We made it out!

248
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,565
Woo-hoo! Where are we?
What are these old buildings?

249
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:21,151
It looks like this could be the
place that huge golden bell

250
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,653
is supposed to be.

251
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:28,575
What is this place? Wait.
Could this be our homeland?

252
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:31,411
[LUFFY]
Your homeland? Hey, not bad!

253
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,955
But where'd that
big hole come from?

254
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,707
[LUFFY gasps]

255
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,420
[AISA] Luffy! Wait!
Where are you going this time?

256
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:46,301
[AISA]
Wait for me!

257
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:49,804
[LUFFY gasps] Hey, Zoro!
What's wrong with you?

258
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,349
Come on, say something!

259
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:54,809
How could this have
happened to you?

260
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,687
How could any of this have
happened with you here?

261
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:01,274
[PIERRE yells]

262
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:07,447
[LUFFY] Nami! Where's Nami?
She's not here!

263
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,828
Wyper...! Wyper, no!

264
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,957
Bazooka guy was really strong.
But even he fell in this fight.

265
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,960
Who could possibly
have done all this?

266
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:23,046
It was Eneru!

267
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,305
[AISA] He's the only one who
could do something like this.

268
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:33,473
[LUFFY grunts]

269
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,019
Eneru, huh? That God guy?

270
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,270
[AISA]
Mm-hm.

271
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:42,023
My Mantra didn't work
at all the whole time

272
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,566
we were in the snake.

273
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,819
So I don't know
what happened here.

274
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:48,613
But I do know that it was
Eneru who did this.

275
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:49,948
[LUFFY gasps]

276
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:51,241
[LUFFY]
Robin!

277
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:57,539
Our Navigator.
She went with him.

278
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:01,126
[gasps]
Just hang in there.

279
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,419
It'll be okay.

280
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,587
So you're saying Nami
was taken away from here

281
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:07,424
by that God guy? Where?

282
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,009
[ROBIN]
I don't know.

283
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:16,766
Listen carefully. If we
don't do something, Skypeia...

284
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,393
...will disappear.

285
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,812
What? It'll disappear?

286
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:25,567
[gasps] My homeland will
be completely gone?

287
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,403
Everything will fall.

288
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:32,365
He said this nation in
the sky was unnatural.

289
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,577
He said he'd send it
crashing to the ground.

290
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:46,296
[LUFFY] Eneru is definitely
going after the golden bell.

291
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:47,964
[gasps]

292
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:51,176
He won't destroy this
place until he's found it.

293
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,928
Right, and you have to stop him.

294
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,806
But you must hurry because
there isn't much time left.

295
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,225
You can't let Eneru
find that bell.

296
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,478
[AISA]
Don't worry.

297
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,146
I know where they are.

298
00:22:03,229 --> 00:22:06,524
There are only two voices
left on this island.

299
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,778
It has to be Nami and Eneru.

300
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,450
[LUFFY]
Aisa.

301
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,208
I need you to take me
to them right now.

302
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,881
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

303
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:33,468
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

304
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:37,472
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

305
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:41,059
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

306
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,354
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

307
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:48,858
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

308
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,945
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

309
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:57,158
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

310
00:22:57,617 --> 00:23:00,203
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

311
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,122
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

312
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:05,709
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

313
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,502
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

314
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:09,421
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

315
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,173
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

316
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,591
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

317
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,468
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

318
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:19,305
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

319
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,141
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

320
00:23:21,224 --> 00:23:24,978
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

321
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:28,148
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

322
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,416
[ENERU] I'm truly annoyed at the
non-fulfillment of my prophecy.

323
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:47,500
[NAMI]
Luffy!

324
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:49,794
[LUFFY] I guess
you're this Eneru jerk.

325
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,797
Wanna tell me what you think
you're doing to my friends?

326
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:56,051
[ENERU] Watch your mouth
when you speak to God!

327
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,428
[LUFFY] You're nothing
at all like a god!

328
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,138
On the next One Piece!

329
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:04,184
"They Finally Clash!
Pirate Luffy vs. God Eneru!"

330
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:07,020
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
