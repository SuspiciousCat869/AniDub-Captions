1
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,525
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,359
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

3
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,795
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,563
the legendary treasure
left behind

5
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,399
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,069
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose
body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,804
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,773
set sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,610
As Luffy and his crew conquer
numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,212
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,780
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:03,783
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,453
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,890
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,093
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:15,929
the crew will cut a path
across the Grand Line

17
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,864
to the New World!

18
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,769
[NARRATOR] Encouraged
by Dark King Rayleigh,

19
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,204
Luffy overcame his sorrow

20
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:27,073
and returned to the site
of his brother's death.

21
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,243
While there, he both
paid respects

22
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:32,045
and delivered a secret
message to his crew.

23
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:35,382
One by one, they received it
through the newspaper.

24
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,452
Normally, Luffy wouldn't
do something like this.

25
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,388
There's gotta be a catch here.

26
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:43,357
[CHOPPER]
I got it, Luffy! Don't worry!

27
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,928
A change of plans, then!
Yeah, okay, okay!

28
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,097
So that's it. Very well, then.

29
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,102
Roger that, Captain!

30
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,138
Yes, Luffy! Yes!

31
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:59,506
[crying]

32
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,141
[NAMI]
But honestly, Luffy.

33
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:05,012
How 'bout how I feel, huh?
You're so selfish!

34
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,580
I gotcha, boss.

35
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,849
Ah-hah. How very clever of you!

36
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,486
No need to worry, Luffy.

37
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,195
[STRAW HATS] See you at
Sabaody in two years!

38
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,633
[LUFFY]
"Luffy's Training Begins!

39
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,803
To the Place We Promised
in Two Years!"

40
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,181
[JIMBEI]
There he is.

41
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,555
Hey, Jimbei! Thank
you for everything!

42
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,623
No, Luffy.

43
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,759
Please, it is I who
should be thanking you!

44
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,668
When we met at Impel
Down, I begged you.

45
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,670
I said I would put my life
on the line for Ace.

46
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,408
And yet, your brother died,
while I still live.

47
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,644
Please forgive me!

48
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,214
You did all you could've done.
Don't beat yourself up.

49
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,950
If it weren't for your help,
I probably wouldn't have made it

50
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,621
into Marineford
in the first place.

51
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,522
You can be proud.

52
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,202
You're right as always.

53
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,470
And who can say,

54
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,672
one day there may still
be something I can do

55
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,007
to help you on your journey.

56
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,779
Until then, see you on
Fishman Island in two years!

57
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,381
Be sure to bring your
entire crew along.

58
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,417
I look forward to
meeting everyone!

59
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,884
[LUFFY]
You got it!

60
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,722
Take care, Jimbei!

61
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,661
[HANCOCK] Luffy, I'm so
glad that you're back

62
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,062
to your old self.

63
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,831
A twinkle in your eye,
that smile--

64
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,967
charming, confident,
and carefree!

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,704
Just seeing your face has
put my heart aflutter!

66
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,138
I'm weak in the knees!

67
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,274
My goodness, I could almost die!

68
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,513
I'm dizzy.

69
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,582
Hey, Hancock, you okay?

70
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,116
[gasps]

71
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,751
[clears throat]

72
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,721
Yes. Yes, of course I am.

73
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,490
Pardon my manners, but could
you take us to the island now?

74
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:33,293
I'd like to begin Luffy's
training as soon as possible.

75
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:35,463
[HANCOCK]
Y-Yes, certainly!

76
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,898
Kuja! Set sail for Ruskaina!

77
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,534
[AMAZONS]
Aye-aye, Snake Princess!

78
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,444
[RAYLEIGH]
This island will be perfect.

79
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,513
It has 48 seasons a year,

80
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,083
so you'll constantly have to
adapt to the harsh conditions.

81
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,718
[LUFFY]
Whoa. Sounds neat!

82
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,354
[LUFFY chuckles]

83
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:03,123
Oh, Luffy?

84
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,091
While you're here,
I'll be sure to bring you

85
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,329
the most delicious food from
Amazon Lily every day.

86
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,796
Doesn't that sound nice?

87
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,699
Yeah! Thanks, Hancock! You rock!

88
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,034
Let's see, could
you start off with

89
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,369
that specialty
gorgon-somethin' or other?

90
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,905
That stuff's really good!

91
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,840
Wh-Why, yes, of course!

92
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,443
[AMAZONS]
Yay! That's our princess!

93
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:27,014
I'll bring anything you desire.
And as much of it as you want!

94
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,281
Oh, my.

95
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,851
I do believe he's uttered my
name at least ten times now.

96
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,521
[sighs]

97
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,390
That must mean we're engaged!

98
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,691
[NYON]
No, it doesn't!

99
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,460
And didn't you say
a little while ago

100
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,928
that you were married?

101
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,531
Foolish girl doesn't even know
the proper order of things.

102
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,735
No, Hancock. Sorry, but I just
can't have you spoiling him.

103
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,805
His sole purpose
here is to train.

104
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,173
He can't let distractions
get in the way.

105
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:53,907
[HANCOCK]
What?

106
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,042
Huh?

107
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:56,943
You have got some
nerve, old man!

108
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,780
Luffy has the right to
decide that! You got it?

109
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,849
And be careful how you respond.

110
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,350
I can turn you to stone!

111
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,386
There are plenty of
things to eat here.

112
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,955
Luffy needs to hunt for himself.
That's part of the training.

113
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,391
[NYON] You'll ruin his
nyose, Snake Princess!

114
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,861
If he can't get by with
roughing it for a while,

115
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,296
then maybe he
shouldn't be a pirate.

116
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,965
This is all for Luffy's benefit!

117
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,937
Luffy. Then, this will
help him become stronger?

118
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,306
Yes, it will.

119
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,807
If this is all for Luffy...

120
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,344
...I'll be patient!

121
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,812
[grumbles]

122
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,849
[HANCOCK] But, Rayleigh, this
island is truly dangerous!

123
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,751
If anything should
happen to him--

124
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,420
[RAYLEIGH] That's why it's
an ideal place to train him.

125
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,758
If you're that worried,
make a wish on a star.

126
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,925
Are you ready, Luffy?

127
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,327
Sure am!

128
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,562
[chuckling]

129
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:52,165
Goodbye, Luffy! It's been fun!
Don't get killed, okay?!

130
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,568
Bye!

131
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,237
[HANCOCK]
Luffy, take care of yourself.

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,275
[LUFFY laughing]

133
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,481
[RAYLEIGH]
You'd better remember this tree.

134
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,748
[LUFFY]
Hm?

135
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,318
[RAYLEIGH] Even the most savage
beasts stay away from it.

136
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,455
It's the only safe
area on this island.

137
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:15,922
[LUFFY]
I don't think I'll forget it.

138
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,624
It's pretty funny lookin'.

139
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,925
[LUFFY laughs]

140
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,303
And another thing to note.

141
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,437
You may have guessed,

142
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,175
but we're the only humans
on the entire island.

143
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,143
Behold the vast wilderness.

144
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,179
Supposedly there was a country
here a long time ago.

145
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,850
But as you can see, the humans
lost the struggle for survival.

146
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,920
The land is rough and
nature relentless.

147
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,054
[gasps]

148
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,773
[laughs]

149
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,876
This place smells
like adventure!

150
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,477
[LUFFY laughing]

151
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,882
[creatures roaring]

152
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,320
The island is crawling
with vicious creatures.

153
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,555
Far too many to be counted.

154
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:25,059
Now, by my estimation,
there's about 500 animals

155
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,728
you don't stand a
chance of defeating yet.

156
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,096
Unless you become stronger,

157
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,399
you might even get
killed in your sleep.

158
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:33,767
How do you know so much
about this place?

159
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,402
Did you used to live here?

160
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,970
Yes, as you will.

161
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,040
And you'll obtain the
same power I did then.

162
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,341
[LUFFY]
Huh?

163
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,244
[RAYLEIGH]
The power known as Haki.

164
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,614
Haki?

165
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,121
[MAMMOTH A roars]

166
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,659
Hey, watch out! There's a...
a huge thing behind you!

167
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,561
What are you doing?
Don't just stand there!

168
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,129
[RAYLEIGH]
Listen to me, Luffy.

169
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,531
Believe it or not,
Haki is a latent power

170
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,600
that everyone has
within themselves.

171
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,369
Wow. I think it's
a giant elephant!

172
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,839
Like, five times
the normal size!

173
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,308
[RAYLEIGH] Observation,
fighting spirit, intimidation.

174
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,045
Haki is really no different
from any combative instincts

175
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,880
normal humans have.

176
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:24,017
[RAYLEIGH] However,
most of them live their lives

177
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,420
without tapping into
their true potential,

178
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:29,723
because they don't have a
teacher like you do now.

179
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,760
You mustn't have any self-doubt.

180
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,363
Only then will you
become stronger.

181
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,298
[roars]

182
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:39,833
Run away!

183
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,571
Time for... Second Gear!

184
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:45,539
Jet Pistol!

185
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,640
[gasps]

186
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,215
Damn it. This guy's no joke!

187
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:58,185
He's super fast for
as big as he is!

188
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,587
[yells]

189
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,822
[roars]

190
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,624
Now watch very carefully.

191
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:07,628
There are two prominent types
of Haki used in battle.

192
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,229
[LUFFY]
Get outta there!

193
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:10,564
[RAYLEIGH]
Don't worry.

194
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,666
The elephant will try to
hit me with its trunk

195
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,369
coming in from the right side.

196
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,536
[gasps]

197
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,375
First is the power to
feel the presence

198
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,010
of others more strongly.

199
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,512
This is known as
Observation Haki.

200
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,551
No way.

201
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,018
[RAYLEIGH]
If you enhance this power,

202
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,889
you can even tell where
unseen enemies are located.

203
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,491
You can determine
how many there are,

204
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,827
and predict what their
next moves will be.

205
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,727
Really?

206
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,696
That left kick won't work.

207
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,531
[LUFFY gasps]

208
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,965
Mantra.

209
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,271
On Skypiea, it has
a different name.

210
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,974
There it's called Mantra.

211
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:54,909
Huh?

212
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,043
Uh! Damn it!

213
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,213
[RAYLEIGH]
Next, the Armament Haki.

214
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,216
Think of it as covering
yourself in invisible armor.

215
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,154
[MAMMOTH A roaring]

216
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,155
Rayleigh, no!

217
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:09,289
[chuckles]

218
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,235
That move, I've seen it before.

219
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,505
Ashigara Dokkoi... Shove!

220
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,408
[MAMMOTH A groaning]

221
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,576
[RAYLEIGH]
Armor that's hard enough

222
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,212
can even be used as a weapon.

223
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,380
Huh?

224
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:36,016
Hey!

225
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,452
I shouldn't be able to feel
that! I'm made outta rubber!

226
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:42,756
Consider it another benefit of
knowing how to use this Haki.

227
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,058
Unless they have a
specific weak point,

228
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,461
those with Devil Fruit
powers are hard to hit.

229
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,498
Armament Haki provides the only
other effective countermeasure

230
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,867
against such enemies.

231
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,201
[gasps]

232
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:58,105
Take those with
Logia-type Devil Fruits.

233
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,341
Their body composition makes
them seem impossible to touch.

234
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,077
But Armament Haki has
the power to strike them.

235
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,780
Ah. So that's how you
were able to hit Kizaru.

236
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,082
Interesting!

237
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,516
With that kinda Haki,

238
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,553
I'd be able punch Smokey
or Aokiji or anybody!

239
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,494
[RAYLEIGH] You can also transfer
Armament Haki to a weapon.

240
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,631
Have you ever seen the
Kuja Pirates' arrows?

241
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:24,965
I have.

242
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,470
It was like they were
made out of steel.

243
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,440
Observation and Armament.

244
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,076
They're the main
two types of Haki.

245
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,179
However, there are some
people in this world

246
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,715
who can use another
type of Haki.

247
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,384
[roars]

248
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,988
[RAYLEIGH]
Watch closely.

249
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,289
[LUFFY gasps]

250
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,746
[gasps]

251
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:51,184
The power to intimidate your
enemies into submission.

252
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,887
This is Conqueror's Haki.

253
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,059
[RAYLEIGH] The most well-known
legends of the Grand Line,

254
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,295
they often have the
rare Conqueror's Haki

255
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,962
at their disposal.

256
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,667
However, although you can
control the Conqueror's Haki,

257
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,302
unlike the other types,
there's no way

258
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:10,103
to train yourself to use it.

259
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,374
The Conqueror's Haki embodies
the spirit of the owner himself.

260
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,309
Strengthen your spirit,
and you strengthen its power.

261
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,879
Hey! That's what you did
at the auction house.

262
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:21,181
Everybody just passed out!

263
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:25,152
Ah. So you already
know what it is.

264
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,621
Then again, that's
not very surprising.

265
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,090
You have the power as well.

266
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:31,024
[gasps]

267
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:38,298
[LUFFY]
Don't you dare!

268
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:51,178
Here's a tip, don't
use Conqueror's Haki

269
00:16:51,212 --> 00:16:54,180
until you can handle it,
as in fully control it.

270
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,050
Or otherwise, you'll end up
overwhelming innocent people

271
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,119
who get caught in the action.

272
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:04,024
Huh? What's the matter?

273
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,296
Amazing!

274
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,332
No wonder you were
his first mate.

275
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,832
You can knock out
half your enemies

276
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,836
without even laying
a finger on 'em!

277
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,372
[laughs]

278
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,907
I guess I was tougher
than you thought!

279
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,044
Actually, wait.

280
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,448
I just realized, I've seen all
sorts of people use Haki.

281
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:33,687
There's Shanks, Grandpa,
Eneru, Aisa, and Hancock,

282
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,323
plus her sisters and
all the Kuja warriors!

283
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,925
This is true.

284
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,128
But still, learning how to
use Haki is no easy task.

285
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,041
Usually, we'd need a lot
more time to train right.

286
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,510
But thankfully,
you're qualified.

287
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:59,680
Here's how it'll work.
Start with the basics.

288
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,983
In two years' time, I'll teach
you how to use all three types,

289
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:04,985
even Conqueror's Haki.

290
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:08,856
Most users, tend to
focus on one type.

291
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:10,391
Or rather, they play
to their strengths,

292
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,727
if they don't have the talent
to master every single art.

293
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,163
That's fine for them, but
I think you'll want to aim

294
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,265
much higher than that.

295
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,033
And if you can
develop all three,

296
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,502
you'll have so much
more at your disposal.

297
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,238
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh. Sounds like fun!

298
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,439
[RAYLEIGH]
Well, then.

299
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,109
I'm now officially your trainer.

300
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,646
Don't think for a second
I'll go easy on you!

301
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,916
Yeah? Give me
everything you've got!

302
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,117
Huh.

303
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,228
[RAYLEIGH]
All right, let's begin.

304
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,030
[LUFFY]
Oh! Just one last thing.

305
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,164
[RAYLEIGH]
Huh?

306
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:57,070
[LUFFY]
If I remember right,

307
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,707
the old man said this tree
is the only safe place.

308
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,146
For two years, I'll
disappear from the world

309
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,614
and hang up my hat here.

310
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,408
[SABO]
Ace, Luffy, listen.

311
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,878
The three of us, we're
gonna leave this country.

312
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:40,981
We're gonna sail the seas,
and see the world.

313
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,217
And we're gonna have
lots of adventures.

314
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,751
We'll be pirates!

315
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,319
[chuckles]

316
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,155
[ACE] I'll be so tough that
all the other pirates

317
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,890
and all the Marines
will bow at my feet!

318
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:52,026
Everyone in the whole
world will know my name!

319
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,362
That's gonna be the legacy
I leave behind when I die!

320
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:56,396
[chuckles]

321
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,899
[LUFFY] Then I know
what I'm gonna be, too!

322
00:20:01,402 --> 00:20:05,438
The King of the Pirates!

323
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,441
[BOTH]
Uh.

324
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,545
[laughing]

325
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,889
[LUFFY]
Oh, almost forgot.

326
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,590
The Vivre card.

327
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:31,699
[LUFFY]
Everybody.

328
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:32,633
Luffy.

329
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:33,868
Luffy.

330
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,035
Luffy!

331
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,036
Luffy.

332
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,104
Hey, Luffy!

333
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,239
Luffy.

334
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,072
Luffy!

335
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,941
Oh, hey, Luffy!

336
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,010
[STRAW HATS]
Luffy!

337
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:48,349
[laughs]

338
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,050
[RAYLEIGH]
C'mon, Luffy, hurry it up!

339
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,419
Let's get started!

340
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,987
[LUFFY]
Be right there!

341
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,766
'Kay, Old Man. Let's do it!

342
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,766
[RAYLEIGH]
Hm.

343
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,903
First off, don't
call me old man.

344
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,570
Call me "Sir Rayleigh."

345
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,606
Or how about
"Professor Rayleigh"?

346
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,375
Maybe "Master Rayleigh."

347
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:16,777
[LUFFY] Gotcha!
Thanks, Old Man Rayleigh!

348
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,246
[RAYLEIGH]
Ugh. Fine.

349
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,740
Hey, Zoro! And Usopp!

350
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,309
Sanji and Nami!

351
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:58,112
Chopper! Robin! Franky! Brook!

352
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,880
And Ace and Sabo!

353
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,214
[LUFFY laughs]

354
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:03,617
I'm making you guys
another promise.

355
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,686
I'll get stronger no
matter what it takes!

356
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,130
[NARRATOR] Two years after
the War of the Best,

357
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,065
the Straw Crew finally
returns to Sabaody.

358
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,368
However, the archipelago
has changed

359
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,004
and with dangerous pirates
lurking around in droves,

360
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:26,173
their departure to the
New World may not go

361
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:28,008
as smoothly as they hoped.

362
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,710
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

363
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,711
"The Beginning of
the New Chapter!

364
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,747
The Straw Hats Reunited!"

365
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,249
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
