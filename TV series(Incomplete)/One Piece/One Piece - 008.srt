attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

countless souls to the seas.

[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

You can have it.

I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

Enemy ships are just like

So, what do you plan to do?

I'm gonna get my own ship,

then gather a reliable

00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,493
I'm gonna take my time. Heh...

108
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,994
...All as a pirate, of course.

109
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:58,865

Say what?!

00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,635
[BUGGY] I do admire your
fighting skill, though.

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,006
If you weren't such a softy,
I'd make you one of my henchmen.

Your henchman?

00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,809
Heh, I don't think so.

[BUGGY]
Huh?

116
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,513
We have completely different
outlooks on life,

117
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,848
so I think we should just
follow our own paths.

118
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,916
That's what pirates do.

119
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,086
Heh! You think you're such
an expert on pirates.

120
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,854
But if we ever
meet on the ocean,

121
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,490
and we'd have to have
a fight to the death.

122
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,360
Yeah... Pirates do that, too.

123
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,029
You never make sense.

124
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,264
Anyways,

125
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,666
you said something about finding
some interesting loot, right?

126
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,868
Huh? Oh yeah, We
found a Devil Fruit.

127
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,103
A Devil Fruit?

128
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,738
I heard that the
different fruits

129
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,606
are incarnations
of the Sea Devil.

130
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,908
Supposedly, if you eat one,

131
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,043
you gain devil powers
but the sea will hate you

132
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,713
and take your ability to swim.

133
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,849
You'd have to be stupid
to eat that thing!

134
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,551
[BUGGY]
I'd never get that treasure

135
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,754
on the ocean floor
if I couldn't swim!

136
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,888
[SHANKS]
But still...

137
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,757
I bet you could
sell that fruit for

138
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,859
at least a hundred

I can't believe I was able to
trick them so easily. [laughs]

00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,835
Now, to jump ship before
they find out the truth!

158
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,071
With the money I get from
selling this Devil Fruit

159
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,139
and finding the sunken treasure,

160
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,509
I'll easily be able to form
my own crew. [chuckles]

I can't move.

that Shanks saved your life?

No, that's not the point
I'm trying to get across!

191
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,852
Because of what he did to
me I was unable to swim,

192
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,321
and therefore unable to
obtain my sunken treasure!

193
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,022
Then, I had a revelation!

194
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,591
If I couldn't go underwater,

195
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,660
then I'd just obtain all
the treasure on dry land!

Using my brand new

who touches my treasure live!

pilfer my hard earned treasure!

Don't run off yet,

00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,785
What's wrong? The mayor's never
been gone for this long before.

I hope he's all right.

It sounded like a battle
was going on in town.

There's been a lot more
cannon fire than usual, today.

I'll go to town
to check it out.

No way.

221
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,600
There are still pirates in town.

It's too dangerous

349
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,606
Hurray!

350
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,174
Oh, does this also mean

351
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,776
you'll be joining me
and my pirate crew?

352
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,281
I told you, no matter what,
I'll never join a pirate crew!

353
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,282
But, okay...

354
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,251
Hanging around with you
seems profitable enough.

355
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,319
Just remember this,

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,589
I'm only joining you...
cause it's in my interest.

357
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,291
Sure!

358
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,326
[ZORO snoring]

359
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,495
[LUFFY]
Hey, Zoro! Wake up!

360
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,629
Zoro!

361
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,264
We're leaving!

362
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,499
[ZORO grunts]

363
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,667
[ZORO]
Did we take care of everything?

364
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,502
Yeah! And we got a Navigator

365
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,537
and we got a chart
of the Grand Line.

366
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,205
[ZORO]
Huh?

367
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,607
[ZORO]
Hmm.

368
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,375
[NAMI gasps]

369
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,612
I'm not sure about this.
I feel light headed.

370
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,548
[NAMI] Of course you do. It's
always something with you two.

371
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,783
Honestly!

372
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,518
Hey, wait a minute.
What did I do?

373
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,720
Are you kidding me?
You're the worst of them all!

374
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,489
Anyways, let's go
help the mayor.

375
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,724
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah.

376
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,493
I guess we should wake the old
guy up, now that it's all over.

377
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,695
‐‐[CITIZEN D] You there!
‐‐[NAMI, LUFFY] Huh?

378
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,830
You're not residents
of this village!

379
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,032
[LUFFY]
Nope. And who are you?

380
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,134
What was all that
cannon fire we heard?

381
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,737
It sounded like there may
have been a battle here earlier.

382
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,306
If you know anything,
please tell us.

383
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,208
Oh good, they're just citizens!

384
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,477
I thought that maybe
they were more pirates.

385
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,712
Oh, Mayor!

386
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,313
[CITIZEN A]
Oh, no! Say something!

387
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,314
[CITIZEN B]
Can you hear me?

388
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,248
[CITIZEN C]
He's out cold.

389
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,150
[CITIZEN E]
The pirates definitely did this.

390
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,518
[CITIZEN F]
How horrible!

391
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,722
No, I'm the one who
kicked that old man's ass.

392
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,523
[CITIZENS]
What?

393
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,692
Hold on! You didn't have
to tell them that, did you?

394
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,927
It's true.

395
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,429
Maybe you should explain to them
so they don't get angry! [gasps]

396
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,731
[CITIZENS grumbling]

397
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,400
Tell me, Why exactly
did you knock our

398
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,402
mayor out and leave him
in the street to die?

399
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,436
You better explain yourselves!

400
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,240
[CITIZEN E] Who are you?
Are you with the pirates?!

401
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,442
[NAMI] They're getting
really bloodthirsty.

402
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,178
We can't let them know that
we're thieves and pirates.

403
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,346
We're pirates.

404
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,084
[CITIZENS]
Just as we thought!

405
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,686
[laughing]

406
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,421
‐‐Idiot!
‐‐But it's the truth!

407
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,389
[CITIZEN E]
Pirates!

408
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,791
How dare you ravage our town!

409
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,094
[CITIZEN D] We won't show you
any mercy for what you've done.

410
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,129
[ZORO]
What now?

411
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,398
Doesn't look like they're
up for a discussion.

412
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,432
[LUFFY laughs]

413
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,701
‐‐[NAMI gasps]
‐‐[LUFFY] Run!

414
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,770
[CITIZENS yelling]

415
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,739
[CITIZEN D]
There's no escape!

416
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,641
[CITIZEN F] How dare you
hurt our beloved mayor!

417
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,112
[yelling continues]

418
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,282
[NAMI gasps] How do you
always make things worse?!

419
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,283
[LUFFY]
This is a good town.

420
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,451
[NAMI]
Huh?

421
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,652
[LUFFY]
Everyone's so mad,

422
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,821
just because of
the old mayor guy!

423
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,257
[yelling continues]

424
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,325
[NAMI gasps]

425
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,427
Something tells me

426
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,763
they're not gonna listen
to our side of the story.

427
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,497
We're turning here.

428
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,632
[NAMI gasps]

429
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,834
[NAMI] Wait, hold on!
You gotta let me know sooner!

430
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,169
[CITIZEN F]
They ran into the alley!

431
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:50,803
[LUFFY]
Ha!

432
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,637
[NAMI]
Huh?

433
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,671
[LUFFY grunts]

434
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,675

Hey! Move, Chouchou!

438
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,583
Get outta here!

439
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,952
[CITIZEN D]
Those three are pirates!

440
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,454
[CITIZEN F] You're barking
at the wrong people!

441
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,656
[barking continues]

442
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,924
Why isn't he letting
us pass through?!

443

Chouchou, get outta here!

Later, doggie! [laughs]

450
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,722
[NAMI]
That was close.

451
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,991
We only made it
because of Chouchou.

452
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,060
Why do we have to
put up with this?

453
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,496
[LUFFY] Does it matter now?
We're done here anyway.

454
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,498
[NAMI]
\Yeah, Maybe so, but...

455
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,500

Hey! Is this your boat?!

456
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,834
It's great!

457
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,504
It's nothing special,
but I guess it'll do.

458
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,873
I stole it from some dumb
pirates a few days back.

459
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,674

That's a big mouth you got!

We been waitin' for
ya, ya little thief.

462
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,014
Never thought you'd run into
us here, now didja, girlie?

463
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,150
[NAMI]
He.He.He.He....

464
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,518
You know these guys?

465
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,819
[NAMI]
Yeah, sort of...

466
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,587
[HENCHMAN A]
Hey, It's not just sort of!

467
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,156
We're bound together by fate!

468
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,724
So, these are your friends.

469
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,593
I guess we'll have to punish
the two of them as well.

470
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,195
It's time you
learned what happens

471
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,697
when you steal other
people's stuff.

472
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,935
Hey, you. Ya' hear me?
Time for your medicine. He. He.

473
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,437

478
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,219
[CITIZEN D] Ah...
Thank goodness he's fine.

479
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,921
[CITIZEN B]
What happened here, Mayor?

480
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,122
[BOODLE sighs]

481
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,624
[BOODLE]
What in the...

482
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,460
[CITIZEN B] It was like
this when we got here...

483
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,730
There were a few pirates when we
arrived, but they all ran off.

484
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,867
Can you tell us what happened?

485
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,236
[gasps] Where are
the young ones?

486
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,873
What's that? Are you talking
about those three kids?

487
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,777
So they're... still alive?!

488
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,113
Those fools. Treating a
senior citizen like that.

489
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,081
How rude.

490
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,785
We drove those pirates
out of town, Mayor.

491
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,787
You don't have to worry
about them anymore.

492
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,255
But it's not enough.

493
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,590
We have to make them pay

494
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,058
for what they've
done to our village.

495
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,560
They deserve to be punished
for destroying the peaceful

496
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,262
town we all worked
so hard to build.

497
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,130
[CITIZEN E]
Yeah! She's right!

498
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,799
[CITIZEN F] There's still
time to go after them.

499
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,833

‐‐[BOODLE] Shut your mouths!
‐‐[CITIZENS gasp]

501
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,171
I'm the only one who's allowed
to complain about those kids!

502
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,140
I won't let anyone else
bad‐mouth them! You hear me?!

503
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,244
What? Why are you protecting
those pirates, Mayor?

504
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,680
Damn it! They think they can
just disappear and that's that?

505
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,781
Where did they go?!

506
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,151
Well... I think they were
running toward the port.

507
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,620
[BOODLE]
Damn kids!

508
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,622
[BOODLE grumbling]

509
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,825
[BOODLE]
They can't just leave like that!

510
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,629
I have a lot of things I
want to say to you all!

511
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,635
[LUFFY]
All right! Let's get going!

512
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,136
[ZORO]
Can I ask you somethin'?

513
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,639
Isn't that Buggy's
mark on your sail?

514
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,307
Well this did used
to be Buggy's boat.

515
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,808
Think I should change it?

516
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,979
[BOODLE]
Hey! Wait!

517
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,314
Young ones!

518
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,882
It's the old mayor guy.

520
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,660
[BOODLE]
I was ready to die.

521
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,829
I was ready to die,
filled with despair...

522
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,200
Thanks! Thank you!

[LUFFY]
Don't worry about it!

525
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,840
Take it easy!

[BOODLE]
Damn you, young ones.

527
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,712
Damn you, young ones.

528
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,249
Damn you, young ones...

529
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,184
I have no words...

530
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,357
[BOODLE]
Huh?

531
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,259
What'd you do, Luffy?! Huh?!

532
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,594
Don't tell me you left that
bag of treasure back there!

533
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,829
Yeah...

534
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,031
That bag was worth around
five million berries, you idiot!

535
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,100
That's right. And they're
gonna need that money

536
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,768
to repair their destroyed town.

537
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,004
But that was my treasure, jerk!

538
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,708
Do you know how hard
I worked to steal it?!

539
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,076

[LUFFY]
Stop! I can't swim!

541
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,379
[NAMI]
That's the whole idea!

542
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,881
[LUFFY] If you want it,
just go back and get it, then!

543
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,883
[NAMI] I can't do that!
You go get it!

544
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,785
‐‐[LUFFY] No! That's dangerous!
‐‐[ZORO laughing]

545
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,853
I could die, you know?!
‐‐[ZORO laughing]

546
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,389
[NAMI] I don't care!
And if you do that again,

547
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,791
I really will throw
you in the ocean!

548
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,362
[ZORO]
Well, for better or worse,

549
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:46,732
looks like we finally have
a navigator in our crew.
