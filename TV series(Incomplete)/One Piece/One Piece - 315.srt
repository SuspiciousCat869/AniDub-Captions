1
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,555
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,460
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,663
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:48,034
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,537
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,705
You can have it!

7
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,142
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,311
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,614
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,017
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,487
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,761
[GARP] The name of your
father is Monkey D. Dragon.

13
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,462
The revolutionary.

14
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,832
What's the deal, you guys?

15
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,768
Why's everyone
freaking out so much?

16
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,202
But there is one group

17
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,038
that is directly
opposing the authority

18
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,940
of the World Government.

19
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,607
The Revolutionary Army.

20
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,511
And the man at the head
of that group is Dragon.

21
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,582
[GARP]
Ah, that was a mistake, huh?

22
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,250
I probably shouldn't
have said all that stuff.

23
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:45,592
[GARP laughing]

24
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,860
[GARP] I take it all back.

25
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,629
Forget it, okay?

26
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,232
[ALL] What?

27
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,070
Anyway Luffy,
since you're my Grandson,

28
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,438
I won't capture you and
turn you over to the Government.

29
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,606
It's fine.

30
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,475
If I tell 'em that,
I'm sure everyone'll understand.

31
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,744
Can't put work
before family, right?

32
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,112
That's not an excuse, sir--

33
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,648
Let's just say they got away.

34
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,682
[GARP] I mostly just came here

35
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,718
as a favor to Coby and Helmeppo.

36
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,753
You boys take your time
and chat it up all you like--

37
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,723
I'm heading back
to my ship for now.

38
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,291
[LUFFY] All right, so long.

39
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,493
Is that all you're gonna say?

40
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,962
[GARP] At least
pretend like you care!

41
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:24,331
I'm your grandpa and you
haven't seen me in ages!

42
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,132
[LUFFY]
But I'm happy you're leaving!

43
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,801
All you've done
is yell and hit me!

44
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,604
[GARP] I still want my
grandson to love me, you idiot!

45
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,606
I'm not as heartless as you!

46
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,707
[CHOPPER] Uh...

47
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,909
[NAMI] I see stubbornness
runs in the family.

48
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,244
Immaturity, too.

49
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,645
[SANJI, CHOPPER] Mhm.

50
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,751
[LUFFY]
Its Name is the New World!

51
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,119
The Fate of the Grand Line.

52
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,559
[SANJI] That old man blew in
and flew out like a storm.

53
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,163
I admit, the part about
Dragon certainly surprised me.

54
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:59,533
And here I thought my
family history was odd.

55
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,567
Where's Luffy?

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,237
He's out front with Coby
and that other guy.

57
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,871
You don't wanna see him, too?

58
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,239
You're old friends, right?

59
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,642
Well, this does
bring back memories.

60
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,945
But Luffy's the one
who saved Coby, not me.

61
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,180
Huh. I wonder
where Nami ran off to.

62
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:17,217
She said something about
getting info from the Navy,

63
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,786
but I guess
she changed her mind.

64
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,855
She said she went to the pool
with Kokoro and the others.

65
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,990
The pool?

66
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,625
Galley-La has a
company pool in the back

67
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,560
for all of its employees to use.

68
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,262
Does that mean
Nami's in a swimsuit?

69
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,464
I'd better bring her a drink!

70
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,799
[LUFFY] So you guys
went over that mountain

71
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,802
to get to the Grand Line, too?

72
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,303
[COBY] "That mountain?" Oh!

73
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,805
You mean Reverse Mountain.

74
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,073
No, we went a different way.

75
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,908
I thought everyone
who came to the Grand Line

76
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,610
was supposed to go
over that mountain.

77
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,811
Like it was the only way.

78
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,380
I swear I read that
somewhere before.

79
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,482
Yeah, but that's actually a lie.

80
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,449
Hey! Coby!

81
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,852
Don't tell him that!
It's a secret!

82
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,187
[laughing]

83
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,355
But it's just Luffy--
It'll be fine!

84
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,024
[HELMEPPO] Wha--What do
you mean "it's just Luffy?"

85
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,793
He is a pirate, isn't he?

86
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,428
[COBY] What harm could it do?

87
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,598
Stop arguing
and tell me already.

88
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,266
Uh... Well, it's top secret,

89
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,568
but there is another
way for the Navy, at least.

90
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,838
That is to say,
they have ships at headquarters

91
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,473
that can sail through
the Calm Belt.

92
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,508
What? That's not fair!

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,945
Of course, the method
isn't 100 percent guaranteed.

94
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,513
Yeah, but what's the trick?

95
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,315
How the heck is anyone
supposed to get through

96
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,484
when the whole ocean there
is packed with Sea Kings

97
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,485
as big as battleships?

98
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,060
That place gave us a lot
of trouble, you know!

99
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,529
The catch is the hulls
of the Navy ships

100
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,663
that sail through there

101
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,865
have a bunch of sea prism
stone strapped to them.

102
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,134
[LUFFY] What does that do?

103
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,502
Uh, I'll try to explain it.

104
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:46,307
The sea prism stones put off the
same "energy" as the sea itself,

105
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,776
so when the fish see
the bottoms of the ship--

106
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,744
The same energy as the sea.

107
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:51,946
So that's it!

108
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,613
That way, even if
they go straight through

109
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,848
a nest of Sea Kings,

110
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,049
the monsters won't attack,

111
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,351
because they won't
notice anything!

112
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,090
[NAMI] So even if they
didn't take the entrance

113
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,591
at Reverse Mountain,

114
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,728
they can still slip into the
Grand Line without any trouble.

115
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,229
Interesting.

116
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,400
Those Navy scientists
are really something else!

117
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,368
Keep talking guys, this is good.

118
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,238
Hey, Pirate Lady,
are you gonna swim or not?

119
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,907
--Huh? Huh?
--Meow! Meow!

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,408
[CHIMNEY] Hello?

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,377
Could you can it
for just a second?

122
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,146
A chance like this
doesn't come very often!

123
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,282
I thought you were cool,
Pirate Lady,

124
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,652
but you're nothing
but a big, stupid jerk!

125
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,755
I'm trying to wiretap here!

126
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,658
[KOKORO] Is that something
you wanna yell out loud?

127
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,461
[COBY] The Navy has the
greatest inventor in the world

128
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,194
working for them.

129
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,130
His name is Dr. Vegapunk.

130
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,731
He's the one who came up
with this plan.

131
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,334
[HELMEPPO] And that's only
the tip of the iceberg for him.

132
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,503
You know that Devil Fruit
you ate, Straw Hat?

133
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,538
He's the one who
identified its power.

134
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,608
He also figured out how
they transfer their abilities.

135
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,675
He even developed a way

136
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,145
to "feed" devil fruits
to inanimate objects!

137
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,214
That was his
biggest project last year.

138
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,382
[NAMI] Dr. Vegapunk...

139
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,285
[LUFFY] I don't get it,
but that sounds pretty cool.

140
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,688
[COBY] The world is
full of amazing people!

141
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,092
You know,
if I had never met you,

142
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,628
I'd probably still be living
in a narrow little world.

143
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:17,764
I wouldn't know a thing
about the Grand Line.

144
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,433
It seems like forever ago

145
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,202
when you burst out of
that barrel on the ship.

146
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,074
[COBY] But who knows
how long I would've been

147
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:30,677
swabbing decks for Alvida
if you didn't show up.

148
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,379
[laughing]

149
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,280
I forgot!

150
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,082
You were on her ship,
weren't you?

151
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,349
Man, that's really funny!

152
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,918
And the reason you were
there in the first place

153
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,985
is even funnier!

154
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,720
[laughing]

155
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,022
I haven't heard this one!

156
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,124
You gotta tell me
the story, too!

157
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,493
Oh, uh,
really, it's nothing.

158
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,128
He was gonna
go on a fishing trip,

159
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,230
but got a
pirate ship by accident!

160
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,499
[HELMEPPO laughing, snorting]

161
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,535
[HELMEPPO] Who does that?
What a dumbass!

162
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,339
I didn't have the courage
to do anything back then.

163
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,374
I wasn't even brave
enough to run away!

164
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,344
But if I hadn't
been on that ship,

165
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,045
I never would've met Luffy,

166
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,215
so when I look back on it,
I think of it as fate.

167
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,350
So even if it was
kind of embarrassing,

168
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,751
since I made a friend that day,

169
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,254
I shouldn't have
any regrets, right?

170
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,225
[HELMEPPO]
Huh. So that's how it is.

171
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,629
Well, something like that. Mhm.

172
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,033
It hasn't been long, but it
seems like you've grown up.

173
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,202
[laughing]

174
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,504
Actually, people
tell me that all the time.

175
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,405
[HELMEPPO] Well,
we owe it to your Grandpa.

176
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,875
That guy puts us through
the ringer every single day!

177
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,577
[LUFFY]
Yeah, I know what that's like.

178
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,747
Sure, but I think the
Vice Admiral's an amazing guy.

179
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,549
We--We had
nowhere else to go,

180
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,917
but he took us in
and made us stronger.

181
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,252
I'll always be
grateful for that.

182
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,789
Learning from him
at Marine Headquarters

183
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,457
is an incredible opportunity.

184
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,127
Who knows what might
have happened otherwise...

185
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,162
I mean, the training
is pretty tough, but--

186
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,343
Really tough, but still,

187
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,846
I'm glad the Vice Admiral
is looking out for us.

188
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,180
[COBY] That's why we
have to try our best

189
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,815
no matter what we do,

190
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,350
so we can pay him back someday.

191
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,085
[HELMEPPO] Yeah, I'd like
to pay him back all right.

192
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,088
Pay him back for all
those punches to the head.

193
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,455
[LUFFY] Good luck with that one!

194
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,624
[HELMEPPO] Maybe not today,
but give it some time!

195
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,708
I don't think
I'll ever get used

196
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,342
to seeing her like that.

197
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,979
Not that I'd really
want to, I guess.

198
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,547
Hey, Pirate Lady!
Let's play volleyball!

199
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,449
[GONBE] Meow! Meow!

200
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:58,992
[LUFFY] What? You guys're
going back already?

201
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,195
Stick around for
dinner, at least!

202
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,932
[COBY] At the end of the day,
we're still enemies.

203
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:07,200
We can't be too
friendly with each other.

204
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,237
By the way,

205
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,206
I was wondering if you've
ever heard the name

206
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,275
they use for the second
half of the Grand Line...

207
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,015
[COBY] On the other
side of the Red Line,

208
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,151
at the far reaches of the ocean,

209
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,755
is a place that few pirates
or marines have ever seen.

210
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,324
They call it--The New World.

211
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,765
The New World.

212
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,471
[COBY] There's a new era coming,

213
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,108
and the people who can guide it
are gathering on those seas.

214
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,711
They say the one who
can master those waters

215
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,179
will become King of the Pirates!

216
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,024
And I believe
that one of these days

217
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,393
you and I will meet
on those waters!

218
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:09,229
[COBY] When that time comes,
I'll be even stronger!

219
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,365
Strong enough to capture you!

220
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:17,204
Because I promised myself
that I'll keep trying 'til--

221
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,407
'Til I become a Marine Admiral!

222
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,113
[COBY] No...

223
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,683
[COBY] I--I'm sorry,
I got carried away!

224
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:29,950
This is so embarrassing.

225
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:32,152
I just wanna dig a hole
and bury my head in it!

226
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,554
That was really arrogant of me.

227
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,423
I got worked up after
seeing you again and I just--

228
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,925
[LUFFY] Coby.

229
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,893
You said you're
gonna fight me, right?

230
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,962
Then you will
become that strong.

231
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,663
You'll have to.

232
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,568
Yeah, but a Marine Admiral?

233
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,506
Next time I see you,
we're gonna be stronger, too.

234
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,441
A whole lot stronger.

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,414
[COBY] I don't get it.

236
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:12,325
[COBY] I just blurted out
some ridiculous dream,

237
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,295
something I don't even
have a right to follow,

238
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,398
but he didn't laugh.

239
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,835
He believed in me.

240
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,137
Look at that--

241
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,539
Turns out you're still
a crybaby after all.

242
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:27,007
Huh, Coby?

243
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:34,681
[COBY] I'm truly grateful that I
was able to see you again today!

244
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,822
[COBY] Keeping up with them
is going to be a real challenge.

245
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,357
I can't kid myself about this.

246
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,061
Just you wait!

247
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,897
We're gonna get
tougher and tougher!

248
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,131
You'll see next time.

249
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,533
When we all meet
in the New World!

250
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,501
Farewell!

251
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:55,803
Hey, wait!

252
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,339
You two better
prepare yourselves,

253
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,774
'cause Coby and I
are gonna blow you away,

254
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,942
you hear me?

255
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,110
[HELMEPPO] Coby, slow down!

256
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,377
[COBY] I can't slow down!

257
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,213
I'm gonna run all the way
to the New World!

258
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,481
[HELMEPPO]
What? You've lost your mind!

259
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,719
Well, Luffy,
you've done it again.

260
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:15,589
You've found another powerful
rival for our crew to fight.

261
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,559
[LUFFY] If Coby says he
can do it, then I believe him.

262
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,230
[chuckling]

263
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,355
I'm glad those two are okay.

264
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,425
But now, after what
happened at Enies Lobby,

265
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,028
I wonder how
the world will react.

266
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,831
It might get messy.

267
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,132
As far as I'm concerned,

268
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:00,300
the island's gone
and that's the end of that.

269
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,102
Though I gotta admit,
I was pretty surprised

270
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,505
when I found out
they decimated CP9, too.

271
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,139
We won't be seeing
that part of the story

272
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:09,009
in the news, since CP-9
was a secret organization

273
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,744
to start with.

274
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,979
[COBY]
It just doesn't seem right

275
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,480
that the Navy burned
down their own island

276
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,617
with the Buster Call and now
they're blaming the Straw Hats.

277
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,185
Luffy would never
do something like that!

278
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,523
[SPANDAM] I had the
power of Enies Lobby--

279
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,324
The power of CP9!

280
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,060
I even had the power
of a Buster Call!

281
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,996
They practically burned
the whole island down!

282
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,299
[SPANDAM] And yet,
even after all that,

283
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,301
even after all I've done,

284
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:38,605
I can't take a single woman away
from a tiny band of riffraff!

285
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:42,242
It's not fair!

286
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,747
Even if it was
only to uphold justice,

287
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,082
nothing good can
ever come of this.

288
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:52,186
If I were you,

289
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,621
I'd be happy those guys
made it out alive at all.

290
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah, I guess you're right.

291
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,996
[HELMEPPO] But seriously,
what were those idiots thinking?

292
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,799
Starting a war with the
whole World Government

293
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,566
just to save one crewmember?

294
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,735
Now what'll they do?

295
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:08,702
I knew it--

296
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:09,937
You're worried about them, too!

297
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,505
You can't fool me!

298
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,374
No, that's not what I
was trying to say at all.

299
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,410
What do I care if they
get themselves killed?

300
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,877
[GARP]
What're you yapping about?

301
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,647
I didn't give you numbskulls
permission to come up here!

302
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,715
[COBY and HELMEPPO screaming]

303
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:22,949
[GARP]
I do you one little favor

304
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,952
and you get all
full of yourselves!

305
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,087
Training resumes right now!

306
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,222
Get down here
and gimme 500 pushups!

307
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,057
[HELMEPPO, COBY] Yes, sir!

308
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:36,997
[NAMI] Here ya go!

309
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,131
Nami-Sweet!

310
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,768
The water-water meat
is all ready!

311
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,168
'Kay!

312
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,607
Granny, that was awesome!

313
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,909
Meow, meow!

314
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,678
That meat sure smells nice!

315
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:53,747
I know! Now say "ah!"

316
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,688
--Hey Sanji, this is yummy!
--Yummy!

317
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,756
Yummy!

318
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,225
Water-water meat barbecue!

319
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,661
Sniper King--
Where'd you come from?

320
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,096
Eat all you want.

321
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,830
I don't care anymore!

322
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,600
What the hell're
you crying for?

323
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,534
[SANJI] I'm not crying!

324
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,137
I just got smoke
in my eyes, that's all!

325
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,839
So how is it, Robin?
Nice and juicy, huh?

326
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,273
[ROBIN] Yes, it's heavenly.

327
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,109
[ZAMBAI] Look, it's them!

328
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,912
Hey Straw Hat!
Are you finally awake?

329
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,580
Oh, it's the Franky Family!

330
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,649
Get over here and eat!

331
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,317
Barbecue time, boys!

332
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,219
[FRANKY FAMILY SILVERHAIR]
My favorite!

333
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,555
[LUFFY] We got too many guys
and too little meat!

334
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:36,489
Someone get some more!

335
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,494
It's Sodom and Gomorrah!

336
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,600
Hey, save some for me!

337
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,668
Me, too!

338
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,604
Guys, over here! Hey!

339
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:51,638
[TILESTONE] Straw Hat!

340
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,707
Feeling better now?

341
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,442
[LUFFY] Galley-La's here, too!

342
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,779
Who said you could use
the company pool, anyway?

343
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:00,881
Put on some clothes! Jeez!

344
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:03,350
Have you never seen
a swimsuit before?

345
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,619
Well...

346
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,388
--Something smells delicious.
--[PAULIE] Don't look, sir!

347
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,657
This perverted harlot
is going to corrupt your eyes

348
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,592
with her filthy body!

349
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,793
Really, now.

350
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,761
We can't take a break
once we start building the ship.

351
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,830
[FRANKY] That's why we're
gonna get all our partying done

352
00:18:16,864 --> 00:18:18,032
right now!

353
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:20,000
I know you got a seat
set aside for me!

354
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:22,603
'Cause big bro's
the star of the show!

355
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,137
[FRANKY] Wow!

356
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:27,040
We're glad you
could make it, bro!

357
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,511
[USOPP] All right, let's rock!

358
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:34,347
How would you like to
hear Sniper King's #1 hit?

359
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,586

[AOKIJI] Stay where you are
and listen, Nico Robin.

375
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,505
[ROBIN] It can't be.

376
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,273
Aokiji?

377
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:40,747
Why didn't you try to
escape like you usually do?

378
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:45,252
If you'd acted on your own, you
could've gotten away from CP-9.

379
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,957
Even you should know
that this time was different.

380
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,192
I couldn't just abandon my crew.

381
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,661
I couldn't leave them to die.

382
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,898
You might not know this,

383
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,133
but your friend, Jaguar D. Saul,

384
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:04,070
that I was forced to kill
in Ohara, was my friend, too.

385
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,074
[SAUL] Kuzan, wake up.

386
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:11,511
You can't tell me
this nonsense is justice!

387
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,448
[SAUL] Can you take pride
in something like this?

388
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,023
[AOKIJI]
Although I carried out my duty

389
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,591
as a Marine that day,

390
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:26,794
I also honored his
wishes by sparing you

391
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:28,628
and helping you escape.

392
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,701
After that, I still felt
responsible for your life.

393
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,935
But when 20 years had passed

394
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,971
and you still
hadn't found a home,

395
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:40,040
I began to fear Saul
had made a mistake.

396
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,408
[AOKIJI] In the end,

397
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:45,412
even I had decided you were
too dangerous to live.

398
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,014
[AOKIJI]
I was certain that Enies Lobby

399
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,384
would end the story
of Ohara once and for all.

400
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,186
[AOKIJI] Of course,
I never anticipated

401
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:56,456
that Straw Hat's little gang
would have defeated all of CP9.

402
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,830
[AOKIJI]
So, have you finally found

403
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,098
the place where you belong?

404
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,100
[ROBIN] Yes.

405
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,238
In the end, I don't
know if Saul was right.

406
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,443
I don't know if what I've done
is right or not, either.

407
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,610
So now,

408
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:19,379
I need you to show me
the answer to that question.

409
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,850
I intend to.

410
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:25,786
[AOKIJI] Then live
your life with courage,

411
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,656
and prove that
Ohara is still alive.

412
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,164
[ROBIN] Aokiji!

[CHOPPER and USOPP laughing]

418
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:58,252
[CHOPPER]
That's the best ever, Luffy!

419
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,721
[NAMI] Seriously,
could you guys grow up already?

420
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,022
[LUFFY] Whatever.

421
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,991
You were stuffing
your face a second ago, too.

422
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:04,825
You wanna try?

you've been searching for.

ain't no one born into
this world to be alone!

430
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,749
[ROBIN] You were right, Saul.

431
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:39,559
[SAUL] Share your life with
them, and never let them go.

432

[RANDOM CITIZEN 315A]
Here! Check it out!

434
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:56,476
[ROBIN]
Maybe I should try that myself.

435
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,544
[LUFFY] Yeah, Robin!

436
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,013
Do it! Do it!

437
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:00,781
[SANJI]
You're a bad influence, Luffy!

438
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:01,949
Don't encourage her!

439
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:03,117
[LUFFY] You just cook the meat!

440
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,585
Don't tell us how to eat it!

441
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:14,294
[SHANKS]
Pardon the big entrance,

442
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:17,230
but this is an
enemy ship, after all.

443
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,532
Anyway, Whitebeard,

444
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:21,235
there's something
I need to discuss with you.

445
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:24,905
[SHANKS] It's about your
Second Division Commander, Ace.

446
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:27,074
I want you to stop him.

447
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:29,076

The Linchpin
to the Reckless Era.

450
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:35,649
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
