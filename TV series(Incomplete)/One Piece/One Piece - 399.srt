Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18

Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540

And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,402

by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,544
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

42
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,946
turned to rubber body after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:54,949
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:57,785
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,521
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,589
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:04,292

That's a negative.

Our orders are to secure the

00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,084
[KILLER] Huh. Awful
impatient, aren't they?

179
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:53,594
What's up with your body,
Straw Hat? Not a cool finish.

180
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,729
It isn't?

181
00:10:54,762 --> 00:10:56,063
Doesn't matter what they do.

182
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:58,933
Their formations don't
amount to crap now.

183
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:03,504
Brigadier General! It appears
the remaining pirates

184
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,840
have exited the
auction house. Sir!

185
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,675
Hm...

186
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:20,588
They wanna escape. I won't let
them make a mockery out of us!

187
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,123
We've got plenty
of reinforcements!

188
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,891
The three hostages
are accounted for

189
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,559
and secured at the
back entrance, sir.

190
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,729
Aim the mortars at the crew
members without powers!

[MARINE OFFICER 398B]
Firing squads to the rear!

192
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,201
We are now commencing
an all-out attack!

193
00:11:37,104 --> 00:11:39,573
Move in! Now! Take them down!

You see?

197
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,884
They've broken rank and
they're totally disorganized.

198
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,585
They're running in
for a blind attack.

Heh. Hey, Straw Hat.

00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:01,562
I'm glad I had this little
chance to meet you.

203
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,899
But the next time, I won't show
you any mercy, understand?

204
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,611
Mm...

205
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,281
Fair enough, but I'm the one
who's gonna find the One Piece.

What are you
standing around for?

[KILLER]
Hm?

215
00:12:48,943 --> 00:12:52,346
[KID] On our journey up to this
point, we've been ridiculed

216
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,648
whenever we mentioned
the One Piece.

217
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,985
They said we were on a fool's
errand searching for it.

218
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,887
[KID]
And each time that happened.

219
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:03,791
I slaughtered everyone
who even snickered.

220
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,293
What lies ahead is a sea
of death for those who think

221
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,364
the One Piece is
something to laugh at.

222

Nope. Not even close.

all set to help you guys

252

you ready to do this, men?

Yes! Life is rosy and beautiful!

Wasn't really looking for help
from those goofballs again.

255

in a hurry, so--

351
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:30,761
[KILLER]
Wait. Is that?

352
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,531
What's he...

353
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:38,101
...doing out here?

354
00:19:40,837 --> 00:19:43,440
[BEPO yelling]

355
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,546
That bear's a maniac!
How are we gonna stop him?

356
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,949
What I want to know is:
how can a bear talk?

357
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,450
[BEPO]
Yeah, I'm sorry.

358
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,551
[MARINES]
He's shy about it?

359
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:55,953
We don't have time
for this, Bepo!

360
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,888
[BEPO gasps]

361
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:03,994
[MARINES screaming]

362
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,063
[MARINE 399QQ] Dammit!
They destroyed the bridge!

363
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,564
[BEPO grunts]

364
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,138
You're the new guy, so
you rank under me, okay?

365
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,674
Long as I'm not a
slave, fine by me.

366
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,817
It looks like we
managed to lose them.

367
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,585
Awesome! That means we
can go straight back

368
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,487
to the amusement park
and have more fun!

369
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,155
[USOPP, SANJI]
What the hell's wrong with you?

370
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,156
[LUFFY]
Huh?

371
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:44,101
[motor churning]

372
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,569
[DUVAL]
Yahoo!

373
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:48,672
[RAYLEIGH laughing]
Good work there, son!

374
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,741
You must be pretty skilled
to be able to remodel

375
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:53,076
this craft in such a
short period of time!

376
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,112
[DUVAL]
I'll say! You're amazing!

377
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,180
It's so fast now!

378
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,181
[FRANKY]
No biggie.

379
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,517
[CAMIE, PAPPAGU laughing]

380
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:08,959
Hm. I'm pretty sure
Peterman's hideout

381
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,695
is supposed to be
somewhere around here.

382
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,064
Peterman, huh?

383
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,868
[SHACHI]
Captain! Look there!

384
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,805
Huh? Eustass...

385
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,540
and...

386
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,908
Is that--?

387
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:41,658
Well, damn.

388
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,728
What's one of the
Seven Warlords doing here?

389
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,912
Trafalgar Law.

390
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:07,284
Would you look at that.
He knows my name.

391
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:11,621
[LAW gasps]

392
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:16,927
Captain!

393
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,164
This archipelago is next
to Navy Headquarters

394
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,766
and Marie Jois!

395
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:25,602
Just about anybody can
show up here at any time!

396
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,038
Marine forces are coming
up from the rear!

397
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,378
Really can't predict this guy.

398
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:37,981
Hey, Trafalgar! Don't
get involved with this.

399
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,321
Would you give it up already?

400
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:47,157
You should know by now you
can't tell me what to do.

401
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,626
Anyway, big guy, we've
had enough ugly surprises

402
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,628
for one day. I'm not
about to wait around

403
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,797
for an Admiral to show up.

404
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:58,001
So I suggest you
let us pass through.

405
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,178
[LAW]
Bartholomew Kuma!

406
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,687
[LUFFY]
What? Are you for real, old man?

407
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,322
You were on the
Pirate King's ship?

408
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:20,924
[USOPP] But they caught
him and executed him!

409
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:21,992
How'd you get away?

410
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,694
[RAYLEIGH] Actually, no
one "caught" Roger at all.

411
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:26,029
He turned himself in.

412
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,164
[USOPP]
What?

413
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,832
[RAYLEIGH] I can teach you
the secrets of this world,

414
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,900
if you would hear them.

415
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,401
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

416
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,870
"Roger and Rayleigh --
The King of the Pirates

417
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:35,205
and His Right Hand Man."

418
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:37,707
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
