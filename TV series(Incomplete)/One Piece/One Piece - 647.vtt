WEBVTT

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.047
[cackles]

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.355
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.092
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.296
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.039
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:37.548
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.582 --> 00:02:40.420
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.370
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.480
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:55.886
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.924
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.194 --> 00:03:03.199
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.232 --> 00:03:04.836
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.476
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.511 --> 00:03:12.819
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.062
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:21.235
of the New World, the Straw Hats
form an alliance with Law.

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.041
Their current objective is to
destroy a man-made

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:26.880
Devil Fruit Factory in the
kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.152
Soon, Luffy becomes
sidetracked by

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:32.558
a tournament with the
Flame Flame Fruit as a prize.

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:48.156
[CROWD cheering]

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.661
[GYATS] The arena has been
completely littered with

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.001
the unconscious bodies
of once-mighty warriors.

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:58.310
All thanks to the clashing wills
of these final two fighters!

00:03:58.343 --> 00:04:03.152
But it begs the question,
what did we just witness?

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:07.327
[CHIN JAO chuckles] So you wield
the Conqueror's Haki as well?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.537
But what sort of king could
you ever hope to be, huh?

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.306
[LUFFY]
King of the Pirates!

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.077
[CHIN JAO]
What a bunch of rubbish!

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.114
Don't you know there
are countless souls

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:19.385
in the New World who
can wield such power?

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:21.791
The only way to determine
who deserves the title

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.028
is a battle amongst you all.

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:26.733
And at the end of it, you'd
find the strongest warrior

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.737
amongst a legion of Conquerers!

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.010
Only then can one be
called King of the Pirates!

00:04:33.814 --> 00:04:35.183
[LUFFY grunts]

00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:39.926
Now, tell me before I kill you.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.130
Who taught you Haki?

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:45.303
Rayleigh did!

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:49.145
[CHIN JAO]
So, he's still alive.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:51.248
How irksome!

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.023
[CHIN JAO]
Enough talk!

00:04:55.057 --> 00:04:57.895
I'm sick of
dredging up the past!

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:02.237
[GYATS] Chin Jao manages to land
a powerful kick against Lucy!

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:05.410
Even though he's retired, the
strength of the Happosui Army's

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:08.684
12th commander hasn't
diminished with age!

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:12.091
Huh? What?!

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:15.129
[CHIN JAO crying]

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:20.742
[CHIN JAO] Give me back my
treasure, Straw Hat!

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:23.547
Indeed, I may gaze
upon its splendor,

00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:27.388
but it lies forever waiting,
just beyond my reach.

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.358
So close, yet so far!

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:31.262
A living hell!

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:34.636
[wailing]

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.339
[GYATS]
What's going on?!

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:39.646
It appears this legendary pirate

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.852
is bawling his eyes out!

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:48.162
[BOO]
Sai.

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:50.968
I thought the plan was
for you to win the match.

00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:53.473
I wasn't worthy enough
to move to the finals.

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:54.709
But trust me,

00:05:54.742 --> 00:05:57.248
once Grandpa gets going, no
one can stand in his way!

00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:00.420
[crying]

00:06:02.124 --> 00:06:05.230
They called me, "Chin Jao the
Drill" because at one time,

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:08.402
my head possessed an
extraordinary shape.

00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:10.908
And so I ask you,

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.716
do you have any clue what
pain Garp inflicted on me?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.121
For the millionth time,
how should I know?

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:18.690
Maybe you truly are ignorant

00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:21.061
and don't know the
sins of your family,

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:24.703
but since you're his grandson,
I can't let you walk away!

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:26.907
[CHIN JAO growls]

00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:29.546
[CHIN JAO] It may have
been thirty years ago,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.021
but I'm filled with rage
like it was yesterday!

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:35.891
[CHIN JAO yelling]

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.835
[GYATS] Don Chin Jao's
tears have stopped

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.672
and his fists are flying!

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.576
I want to hear you say it!

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.982
Admit that I was wronged
with your dying breath!

00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:54.562
That fiend!
He took away my treasure!

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:57.333
[wailing]

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.608
[GYATS]
And the waterworks are back!

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.946
I wish this geezer
would make up his mind.

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.287
You can be mad or you can cry,
but pick one and stick with it!

00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:10.326
[KIN'EMON, SANJI panting]

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.468
[TOWNSPEOPLE shouting]

00:07:14.503 --> 00:07:16.974
[MAN C] Take him out,
Lucy! Now's your chance!

00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:19.813
[KIN'EMON]
Uh. It's Sir Luffy!

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:22.619
Why can't that boy ever seem to
keep his nose outta trouble?

00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:24.823
All right, Sanji.
I say we go to the Toy House,

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:28.196
rescue Kanjuro, and deal
with this situation later!

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.365
And I wanna help you with that,

00:07:29.398 --> 00:07:31.503
but I'm afraid it's
gonna have to wait.

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:33.741
Looks like we got
a minor setback.

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:35.644
[KIN'EMON]
Hm?

00:07:35.677 --> 00:07:36.914
Tons of Marines.

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:39.418
Looks like they're trying
to surround the coliseum.

00:07:39.451 --> 00:07:41.857
[KIN'EMON]
So many! To what end?

00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.361
[SANJI] Seems like there's an
issue of pirates and criminals

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.533
openly competing in the
tournament.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:50.841
The Navy's gonna scoop 'em up
as soon as they leave the arena.

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:52.812
Well, a society can
only properly operate

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:54.482
if criminals are apprehended.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.518
[KIN'EMON groans]

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.220
You do realize you're
working with pirates

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:58.824
and of them is
standing right here?

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:00.695
Ah, yes. Forgive me.

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.598
We have to find
some way to warn Luffy

00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:04.401
about the situation out here.

00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.372
But the entrance gate
is so heavily guarded

00:08:06.405 --> 00:08:09.946
there's no way
we can get in! Uh!

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:13.587
[BASTILLE] What're you all
doing standing around?

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:18.797
[BASTILLE]
You mean to tell me

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.970
not a single contestant
has left the Colosseum?

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:23.172
No, Sir! Not yet!

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:24.876
[BASTILLE]
I find that hard to believe

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.283
since there were hundreds
of losers from Block A and B.

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:30.921
They should have
already poured out by now.

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:33.627
[MARINE A]
It's very strange.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.531
[MARINE OFFICER A] Vice
Admiral Maynard went undercover

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:36.767
as a competitor,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.138
but we haven't been
able to contact him.

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.610
He just had to
charge in on his own.

00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:44.181
A rookie mistake.

00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:46.318
Whatever's going on inside,

00:08:46.352 --> 00:08:49.892
it's got the stench of
corruption all over it.

00:08:55.003 --> 00:08:58.042
There are two special
laws here in Dressrosa.

00:08:58.075 --> 00:08:59.712
Rules that have
been strictly observed

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:03.220
since Doflamingo's
reign began a decade ago.

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:04.956
What makes 'em special?

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.291
I'll tell you.

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:09.297
First, there's a kingdom-wide
curfew at midnight.

00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:12.204
No citizen is allowed
outside after twelve.

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:15.143
[FRANKY]
What?! Not even grownups?!

00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:17.515
[TOY SOLDIER] Humans have
to return to their homes

00:09:17.548 --> 00:09:20.020
and toys back to
the House of Toys.

00:09:20.053 --> 00:09:22.758
No one is allowed
outside late at night!

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:24.863
Not even to go out
and buy a drink?

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:27.736
[TOY SOLDIER]
Everything's closed anyway.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.037
Second rule.

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.309
Toys must not
enter human houses,

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:34.983
and humans are to
never enter a toy house!

00:09:35.016 --> 00:09:36.686
That's crazy!

00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:39.258
It looks like everyone's
friendly with each other.

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:43.265
So I don't get why there's
a law against it. Ugh.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:44.803
But I guess
there's gotta be some

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:47.509
kind of distinction
between people and toys.

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:50.614
Though anywhere else,
that would go without saying.

00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:52.751
I've only been
here a little while,

00:09:52.785 --> 00:09:56.059
but, really, I've gotten
used to things here already.

00:09:56.092 --> 00:09:58.063
What kind of toys
are you guys, though?

00:09:58.096 --> 00:09:59.532
It's kinda confusing.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.570
You have free will and can talk.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:03.006
I mean whoever created you all

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:06.980
would have to be some sort of
genius like Doctor Vegapunk.

00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:08.449
[ESTA shrieks]

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:11.222
[ESTA]
Somebody! Call the police!

00:10:11.255 --> 00:10:12.357
[FRANKY]
What's goin' on?

00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.627
[ESTA]
Please! Let go of me!

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.063
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND]
Esta! It's me!

00:10:15.097 --> 00:10:17.801
It's got Humanitis!
This toy's broken!

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:20.073
Don't you recognize
my voice, Esta?

00:10:20.107 --> 00:10:22.712
Why don't you remember
who I am? I'm not a toy!

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:25.316
Get away, you disgusting
little creep!

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.653
[MAN A] What's your issue?

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:28.556
You've never acted like this
around her!

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.464
Please, remember me,
Esta! [groans]

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:34.535
Get away from her, you freak!

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:38.577
[GUARD A]
You're comin' with us.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.649
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND grunts]
Dammit!

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:46.192
My Esta! How could you forget
your boyfriend so quick?!

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:49.733
I'm begging you, don't
hook up with that bastard!

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:52.470
You know who I am!

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:56.813
Let go of me!

00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:02.491
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND]
No! Don't!

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:04.528
[clang]

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:10.240
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND] This is
absurd! Unhand me, you fiends!

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:12.545
I'm a human!

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:26.471
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND screaming]

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:30.080
[ESTA]
What a nightmare!

00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:31.382
[MAN A]
It's over now.

00:11:31.415 --> 00:11:34.387
I still can't believe that
toy thought he was human.

00:11:34.421 --> 00:11:35.991
[ESTA]
I know.

00:11:38.028 --> 00:11:40.399
That was weird. What's the deal?

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.838
[MILO'S SON laughing]
Gimme a ride, Onepoko!

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.545
[MILO] Not a chance!
You're way too heavy for me!

00:11:45.578 --> 00:11:47.815
Onepoko!

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:51.488
[MILO'S SON] No, I'm not!
Just one ride, come on!

00:11:51.522 --> 00:11:52.190
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:54.261
I'll have a word with him.

00:12:05.918 --> 00:12:07.387
Don't worry about him.

00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:09.124
He's a toy, just like us.

00:12:09.158 --> 00:12:11.361
Well, half of me is.

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:14.803
Woo! Well, that's
good enough for me!

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:21.583
Tell him who you are.

00:12:21.617 --> 00:12:23.921
I'm the father of
that boy over there.

00:12:23.954 --> 00:12:26.191
That woman with him is my wife.

00:12:26.224 --> 00:12:28.797
My name is Milo, not Onepoko.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.232
[FRANKY]
Huh?

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:34.207
[TOY SOLDIER] Young man,
is your father around?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.080
Nuh-uh! I never had one, sir!

00:12:37.114 --> 00:12:38.750
[TOY SOLDIER]
May I ask if you have a husband?

00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:41.723
[MILO'S WIFE] I don't.
You see, I never married.

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:44.294
Uh, is that so unusual?

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.433
[MILO'S SON]
Bye!

00:12:51.475 --> 00:12:52.978
Hey, soldier.

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:56.085
What were you trying to prove
to me back there with the dog?

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:58.055
What's goin' on here?

00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:03.399
Simple. This kingdom's divided.

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:06.138
A country filled
with the forgotten.

00:13:06.172 --> 00:13:08.342
And those who forget them!

00:13:08.375 --> 00:13:09.545
[FRANKY grunts]

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:14.321
Every toy you see was
at one point a human!

00:13:14.354 --> 00:13:16.793
What?!

00:13:16.826 --> 00:13:19.699
Someone came to our
island ten years ago...

00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:21.903
...courtesy of Doflmaingo.

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:25.644
They turned us into toys
with their Devil Fruit power!

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:29.051
Wait! If you're
a toy that means...

00:13:29.084 --> 00:13:30.821
Look!

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:32.859
We're approaching Flower Field!

00:13:32.892 --> 00:13:35.162
I'll tell you everything
once we arrive!

00:13:57.941 --> 00:13:59.512
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:01.783
[LUFFY grunts]

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:06.559
[CHIN JAO growls]

00:14:06.592 --> 00:14:08.362
[CROWD cheers]

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.201
[GYATS] Although he's
enjoying his golden years,

00:14:11.234 --> 00:14:14.542
that Eight-Impact Fist
is still as sharp as ever!

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:19.217
Chin Jao's fighting
spirit hasn't aged a day!

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.088
Gramps has been
fighting nonstop!

00:14:21.122 --> 00:14:24.328
But his Haki hasn't weakened
once this entire match!

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:27.133
The old man's too
stubborn to tire out!

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:32.678
I'm going to avenge my head
by using it to pummel you!

00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:34.882
[LUFFY] Avenge your head?
What're you talking about?

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.522
[CHIN JAO] Feel free to
suffer before you die--

00:14:37.555 --> 00:14:38.957
it's better that way!

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.228
Now Head-Arms!

00:14:41.262 --> 00:14:43.734
Gum Gum... Balloon!

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:45.036
What?!

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:47.240
[CHIN JAO yells]

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.450
[GYATS] Lucy has managed
to deflect Chin Jao's attack!

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:55.189
[LUFFY grunts]
That was a close one.

00:14:55.222 --> 00:14:58.362
[GYATS] Ah! But he's still
not down for the count!

00:14:58.395 --> 00:14:59.632
You got lucky!

00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.404
If I were still "Chin Jao
the Drill" like the old days,

00:15:02.437 --> 00:15:07.280
you would have been struck dead
by my cranium, most assuredly!

00:15:07.314 --> 00:15:09.151
He took my treasure.

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:11.055
Stole away my vast fortune!

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:13.593
But the worst thing
was stunting my strength!

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:17.802
And after waiting 30 years, I'll
finally have my peace of mind!

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.707
[yells]

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:28.489
[LUFFY grunts]

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.965
[LUFFY]
Like I already told you,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.405
if you gotta problem
with my grandpa...

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:37.106
[MAN B gasps]

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.576
[GYATS gasps]

00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:43.018
...leave me out of it!

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:57.180
[CROWD cheers]

00:15:57.214 --> 00:16:00.186
[GYATS]
Did it work this time?

00:16:00.219 --> 00:16:03.326
Did Lucy knock him out?

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.732
Chin Jao isn't moving!
This could be it!

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:11.275
[CHIN JAO grunts]

00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:12.978
[gasps]

00:16:16.986 --> 00:16:19.391
[GYATS]
N-No! He's still in the match!

00:16:19.424 --> 00:16:21.361
The battle continues!

00:16:22.632 --> 00:16:26.205
[CHIN JAO groans]
Straw Hat!

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:28.442
Let's finish this!

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:30.614
[CHIN JAO yells]

00:16:30.648 --> 00:16:33.252
[GYATS gasps]
What the hell?!

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:37.895
[GYATS gasps]

00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:39.098
[GYATS]
Unbelievable!

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:41.469
Is this some sort of
new fighting stance?

00:16:41.503 --> 00:16:44.642
Doesn't seem very
practical, I must say!

00:16:52.624 --> 00:16:53.527
[LUFFY grunts]

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.466
[CHIN JAO]
Hasshoken! Head-Arms Spin!

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.151
Finish him off, Grandpa!

00:17:06.184 --> 00:17:08.857
Do it in the name of
Hasshoken! He's done for!

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.061
We believe in you, Grandpa!

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:12.765
[CHIN JAO]
Vengeance will be mine!

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:16.038
I'd like to see you
try to stop this attack!

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.111
I don't think I'm ever gonna
get why you're so mad at Gramps.

00:17:19.144 --> 00:17:21.683
But that ain't gonna
stop me from winning this!

00:17:21.716 --> 00:17:23.620
Here I come!

00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:28.764
Gum-Gum... Gatling!

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.166
[GYATS]
This could be it!

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.535
The final test of strength

00:17:31.569 --> 00:17:33.673
between the only
remaining fighters.

00:17:33.706 --> 00:17:35.611
Which one will go all the way...

00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:36.478
[LUFFY yells]

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:39.785
[GYATS]
...and win Block C?

00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:56.318
[LAW panting]

00:17:56.351 --> 00:17:57.822
Run as much as you like,

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:00.293
you're just delaying
the inevitable, Law.

00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:03.231
Do you think one of your
friends is going to save you?

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.653
[LAW groans]

00:18:15.557 --> 00:18:18.930
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:22.403
Come on, pick up!
Nami! What happened?

00:18:35.797 --> 00:18:37.433
[grunts]

00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:41.909
[LAW groans]

00:18:41.943 --> 00:18:44.682
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
No mercy for the wicked!

00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:47.287
[FUJITORA] It'd be quicker
if I wasn't all thumbs.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.395
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:53.465
[LAW panting]

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:57.073
[ringing]

00:18:57.106 --> 00:18:59.678
What're you waiting for, Nami?

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:02.416
You were attacked,
weren't you? [gasps]

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:06.725
[DWARVES scream]

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:09.197
[YOUNG DWARF A ]
It's Usoland's Haki!

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.502
[DWARF A]
He truly is a legend!

00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:15.543
[LEO grunting]

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:21.354
We need tension rods to keep all
the shelves from falling down.

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:23.993
Say, Leo. You should
get going soon.

00:19:24.027 --> 00:19:25.196
Do you need a lunch?

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.532
Thanks, Grandma, but I'm sure

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.870
there'll be something to
eat over at headquarters.

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:30.306
[GRABBA]
If you're sure.

00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:32.410
[LEO yelps]

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:34.080
Careful!

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.422
I know! I'm gonna sew
everything that might fall over!

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.077
There! Safety's been restored!

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.250
[GRABBA] Boy, that Usoland
sure is something, isn't he?

00:19:52.283 --> 00:19:54.789
So much power he can
shake the entire kingdom

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:56.793
only using that
strange ole' Haki.

00:19:56.826 --> 00:19:57.961
That's right!

00:19:57.995 --> 00:20:00.968
'Cause Usoland's a hero
straight outta the legends!

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.671
Oh, and by the way, Leo.

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:05.610
I know I look old,
but I'm not gonna topple over.

00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:08.616
[DWARVES chattering]

00:20:10.887 --> 00:20:13.058
So this is Tontatta Kingdom.

00:20:13.092 --> 00:20:14.628
What kind of
relationship do you think

00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:17.835
these guys have with the
Warlord Doflamingo anyway?

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:21.141
No clue. But I know they're
dead serious about fighting him.

00:20:21.174 --> 00:20:21.909
[USOPP gasps]

00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:24.113
Hey there, Usoland and Robiland!

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.917
Have you two gotten
enough to eat?

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:29.290
[USOPP grunts] Oh, yeah,
I totally pigged out.

00:20:29.324 --> 00:20:30.828
Um.

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:33.767
That is, I'm full
and ready for action!

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.769
[LEO yelps]

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:37.307
[USOPP chuckles]
See, what did I tell ya?

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.477
My body's trembling
with so much excitement

00:20:39.511 --> 00:20:41.649
it's making the earth
shake all around us!

00:20:41.682 --> 00:20:42.551
[DWARVES cheer]

00:20:42.585 --> 00:20:43.920
[YOUNG DWARF A ]
How awesome is that?

00:20:43.954 --> 00:20:45.891
[DWARF A]
His power is off the charts!

00:20:45.924 --> 00:20:47.962
[gasps]

00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:49.431
One question, Leo.

00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:51.536
Your people keep mentioning
some "final battle"

00:20:51.569 --> 00:20:53.205
involving yours truly.

00:20:53.238 --> 00:20:56.779
But... what reason do you
wanna fight Doflamingo?

00:20:56.813 --> 00:20:58.215
Huh?

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:03.458
[DWARVES laughing]

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:05.362
Not just a hero,
but a comedian, too!

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:08.937
It's because we wanna rescue
500 of our closest friends!

00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:11.308
Over at the secret
factory in Dressrosa

00:21:11.341 --> 00:21:13.278
where they're being
enslaved, of course!

00:21:13.311 --> 00:21:15.584
What?! Did you say a factory?

00:21:15.617 --> 00:21:18.523
You mean the one Luffy and
the others want to destroy?

00:21:18.557 --> 00:21:19.625
Hey, wait a minute.

00:21:19.659 --> 00:21:22.296
The same one that's
producing SMILE?

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.600
Huh?

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:26.071
I don't know what they're being
forced to manufacture there.

00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:28.710
But they've imprisoned
an important Tontatta:

00:21:28.743 --> 00:21:31.214
Our obnoxious, selfish,
fickle, despicable,

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:35.356
mean-spirited Princess Mancherie
is being held inside that plant.

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.692
So we've gotta hurry!

00:21:36.726 --> 00:21:39.932
Yeah? The way you describe her
makes her sound kind of awful.

00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.334
Oh, she is!

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:44.542
But she's still one of us!

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:47.581
And Noland himself would
rescue anyone who needed saving,

00:21:47.614 --> 00:21:48.348
wouldn't he?

00:21:48.381 --> 00:21:50.687
[USOPP]
What?! Uh, right...

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.058
That's totally what
a real hero would do!

00:21:53.091 --> 00:21:56.164
I mean I am his
descendant after all!

00:21:56.197 --> 00:21:57.367
[DWARVES cheer]

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.105
[YOUNG DWARF A] Let's hear
it for our legendary hero!

00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:03.112
[FLAPPER panting]

[FLAPPER panting]

00:22:05.917 --> 00:22:07.922
[LEO]
Do you have important news?

00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:09.124
You bet!

00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:11.629
I heard the Don Quixote family
is leaving the palace!

00:22:11.662 --> 00:22:12.631
[LEO grunts]

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:14.334
[FLAPPER]
Probably beneath the Coliseum!

00:22:14.367 --> 00:22:15.504
[DWARVES gasp]

00:22:15.537 --> 00:22:17.541
[FLAPPER] The Yellow Kabus
and Bian's Pink Bees

00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:19.879
are ready to fly anytime!

00:22:19.912 --> 00:22:20.814
Understood!

[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:22:31.735 --> 00:22:33.438
We've got nothing
to worry about!

00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:36.445
Not with the legendary
hero, Usoland, beside us!

00:22:36.478 --> 00:22:38.583
He's the strongest ally
we could ever hope

00:22:38.616 --> 00:22:40.286
to have in our struggle!

00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:42.791

a miracle! It's destiny!

[USOPP]
Eh?

00:22:43.526 --> 00:22:44.628
We'll win today's battle

00:22:44.661 --> 00:22:47.466
and rescue every one
of our missing friends!

00:23:00.026 --> 00:23:01.862
Inside the factory!

00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:02.864
Everyone!

00:23:02.898 --> 00:23:04.668
Go!

00:23:04.702 --> 00:23:07.540
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:23:14.555 --> 00:23:17.226
[NARRATOR] As thrilling battles
unfold in every direction.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.199
Usopp and Robin accompany
the Little People of Tontatta

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.871
in their mission to
destroy the evil factory.

00:23:22.905 --> 00:23:24.641
Now, after four centuries,

00:23:24.675 --> 00:23:27.515
the world will experience the
tale of a brand-new hero,

00:23:27.548 --> 00:23:29.885
the incredible Usoland!

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:31.823

On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.856 --> 00:23:35.530

I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
