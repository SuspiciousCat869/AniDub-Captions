1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,824
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,493
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,964
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:50,003
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,907
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,477
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,712
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,349
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,319
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,290
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,294
Kushishi!

48
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,296
This little guy is just
what I need to bring me

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,631
one step closer to becoming
King of the Pirates.

50
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,866
Right, Doctor Hogback?

51
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,834
Fasfasfasfas!

52
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,671
Since the time I met
you ten years ago.

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,940
I've put all of
my time, resources,

54
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,908
and energy into
making number 900!

55
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,876
With that shadow,

56
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,445
it will make the
greatest zombie of all time!

57
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,347
With that power
at your fingertips,

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,616
nothing will be
beyond your reach!

59
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,519
[ABSALOM] That means it
will only be a matter of time

60
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,289
before I become the Cemetery
King of the entire world!

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,526
[PERONA] And I'll transform
all the cute creatures

62
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,527
of the world into zombies.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,429
Then I'll have an entire
adorable kingdom full

64
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,564
of servants that
never talk back!

65
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,600
[SPIDER MICE]
Heave ho! Heave ho!

66
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,234
Luffy!

67
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,736
[USOPP] Idiot! Keep quiet!

68
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:57,804
[USOPP] He lost his shadow!

69
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,439
That doesn't mean
that he's dead!

70
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,441
Remember? Brook said so!

71
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,909
[BROOK] Both of you. Take this.

72
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,547
[ROBIN] What is it?

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,415
[BROOK] The weakness
of these zombies.

74
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,817
Their weakness, huh?

75
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,585
What is this stuff, anyway?

76
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,754
It's ordinary salt.

77
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,956
So, in summation, in order
to defeat the zombies,

78
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,392
simply throw salt
into their mouths.

79
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,561
That's the trick! Salt! Mouth!

80
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,629
Deader than dead!

81
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,796
Make no bones about it!

82
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,064
[ROBIN] Pardon me, Brook.

83
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,767
But how do know so much about
this island and its residents.

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,902
And how do know
the zombie's weakness?

85
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,704
[BROOK] It all relates
back to an incident

86
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,073
on this island 5 years ago.

87
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,843
I was sent out to sea,
just like all the others.

88
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:40,847
Luckily, I awoke and was able to
retrace my path and return here.

89
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,857
[BROOK] Once I did, I went
ashore and began my battle.

90
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,694
[BROOK] Unfortunately, the
outcome was a crushing defeat.

91
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,667
[BROOK] I'm in a hurry,
so please excuse me.

92
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,635
I'll be on my way now.
Good luck to you.

93
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,970
[FRANKY] Hold on a second!

94
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,938
While you're still
in a mood to talk,

95
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,440
there's one more
burning question

96
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,409
I still need an answer to.

97
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,513
Kiiiishiii!

98
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,114
[HOGBACK] I'm looking
forward to this!

99
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,684
When I first came across
this corpse in the Land of Ice,

100
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,185
I couldn't stop shaking!

101
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,853
Honestly, I was trembling!

102
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,988
I can't believe
that I'm going

103
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,090
to revive that
extraordinary creature!

104
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,793
This will go down in the
books of Zombie Creation as...

105
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,162
Cindry, why do keep blocking me?

106
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,964
[MORIA] Another legend
will be brought back to life!

107
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,634
Kushishishi!

108
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,972
It's been quite a
while, hasn't it, 900?

109
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,781
The time for his
revival is finally here!

110
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:53,152
Behold! The only warrior
in history, who was ruthless

111
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,656
and powerful enough to
be given the name "Devil"!

112
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,158
This is Oars!

113
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,697
[LUFFY] "Awakening
After 500 Years!!

114
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,733
Oars Opens His Eyes!!"

115
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,930
[MORIA] Shall we begin?

116
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,939
[USOPP thinking] Wha...
What the heck is that?

117
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,641
A giant's, corpse?

118
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,710
Even for a giant,
that thing's huge!

119
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,216
Chopper, they'll
hear you! Be quiet!

120
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,125
[MORIA] I see you're just

121
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,261
as energetic as your
master, little shadow.

122
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:51,971
But now I am your
new master. Kushishiii!

123
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,575
[MORIA] Yet fear not,
for I shall grant you both voice

124
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,845
and body so you may
live on as a zombie.

125
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,946
Abandon your memories

126
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,348
and abandon your
remnants of humanity,

127
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,785
so you may serve me
as an undying soldier!

128
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,253
[NAMI] Huh?

129
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,187
[MORIA]
Kiiishii...

130
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,323
Contract completed!

131
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,359
It works like this, Cindry.

132
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,228
You're supposed to give
up all your memories,

133
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,630
all the ties to your past life.

134
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,200
That means, we should be
able to eat on plates, right?

135
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:22,735
If you say that again,

136
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,971
I'm going to break the
plates in your knees.

137
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,206
Aaaah! You're scary!

138
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,908
Please Cindry. Stop!

139
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,278
Cindry is way too harsh
on Doctor Hogback.

140
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,881
Doctor Harshback.

141
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,290
[MORIA] Now, awaken!

142
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,927
[CHOPPER] His shadow.

143
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,598
Your 500 years of
slumber has come to an end!

144
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,113
This is weird!

145
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,251
Fasfasfas!

146
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,899
[NAMI] The shadow's gone.

147
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:36,842
[MORIA]
Kushishishi!

148
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,044
It went in.

149
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,256
Whoooooooa!

150
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:53,077
Ah... Ah...

151
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,212
[NAMI] Stop it! Don't scream!

152
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,801
Auuugh!

153
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,037
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
The corpse moved!

154
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,773
Who's there?

155
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:58,743
Ah! Crap! We're
screwed! He found us!

156
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,444
Can you blame
me for screaming?

157
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,347
We're all going to die!

158
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,148
[PERONA] Kumacy!

159
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:04,949
Don't tell me you
were conspiring

160
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:08,119
with those pirates
behind my back?

161
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,355
My soon-to-be bride!

162
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,691
But, what are you doing here?

163
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:14,725
[ZOMBIE TRIO]
You can't escape!

164
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,260
Aaaaah!

165
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,596
[loud rumble]

166
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,803
Fasfasfas! Beautiful!

167
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:01,605
A work of art.

168
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,775
A masterpiece. Just great!

169
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:11,315
OOOUUUUUUUU!

170
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:19,456
Meat!!!

171
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,307
What the hell?

172
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:46,550
I'm hungry!

173
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,422
[PERONA] Kumacy, don't let go!

174
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:06,837
[NAMI] Run!

175
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:07,638
[USOPP] Right!

176
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,213
What happened to
my bride, damn it?

177
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:17,147
Where are the pirates?

178
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,350
[GYORO] They ran away!
Like, super fast!

179
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,252
[NIN] They're long gone!

180
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:24,488
Rgh! Come back!

181
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,629
Sanji! Food!
Wait, who's Sanji?

182
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,897
That's weird.

183
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:56,587
[USOPP] Okay, someone
wanna explain this to me?

184
00:14:57,621 --> 00:14:59,390
[CHOPPER] When Luffy's
shadow entered that thing,

185
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:00,824
it started moving!

186
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,893
[NAMI] At least we know
how the zombies work now!

187
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,730
[CHOPPER] It really.
It really came back to life!

188
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,234
There's only one
explanation for all of this.

189
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:13,804
That big guy must
have Devil Fruit powers.

190
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:18,275
The first thing that giant
monster said was "meat."

191
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,544
That means it doesn't
just have Luffy's shadow,

192
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,813
it has part of his
personality, too.

193
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,281
[USOPP] I guess so, huh?

194
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,250
[NAMI] This is all
starting to make sense now.

195
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:28,419
It's just like with
that penguin we ran into

196
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,487
that was acting like Sanji.

197
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,424
[DOGGUIN]
'Cause even if it kills me.

198
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:35,326
I'll never kick a woman!

199
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,627
I see!

200
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,828
So you're saying they put

201
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,997
Sanji's shadow
inside that thing?

202
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,433
[NAMI] That seems
to be what happened.

203
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:44,835
Then the samurai who hit us
with the back of his sword.

204
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,870
Nyohohoho!

205
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,439
That said, perhaps
you would like

206
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:49,573
to show me your panties?

207
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,275
Yeah right!

208
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:56,981
[USOPP] That was Brook!
Of course!

209
00:15:57,014 --> 00:15:59,450
All the weird stuff that's
happening on this island,

210
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:01,618
it's all his fault, isn't it?

211
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,790
[CHOPPER] This isn't giving
people a second chance at life.

212
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,459
No one would ask for this!

213
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:09,560
No one would want it!

214
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,863
He's just playing God,
using humans as his puppets!

215
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,802
[CHOPPER] Doctor Hogback
is an amazing man,

216
00:16:18,836 --> 00:16:19,903
and a medical titan!

217
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,505
I think that he's incredible!

218
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,540
He's not trying
to save anyone!

219
00:16:23,574 --> 00:16:25,542
He lied to all of us!

220
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:28,412
He's nothing more
than another villain!

221
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,514
Chopper...

222
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:31,648
Now's not the time
to get depressed

223
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,017
over something like that.

224
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,817
The only people we need

225
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:35,586
to worry about are
our crewmembers.

226
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,789
I hate to say it, but it's
up to us to save them now.

227
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:40,491
We can't just run
and hide anymore,

228
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:43,093
we've gotta go to wherever
they were taking Luffy's body!

229
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,094
[NAMI] Right.

230
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,963
I think they said it was
going back to the ship.

231
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,431
They must mean the Sunny.

232
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,601
If the same thing
happened to Zoro and Sanji,

233
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,102
then they might
be waiting there, too.

234
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,470
That's most of
the crew, at least.

235
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:55,072
I still can't believe
they got caught!

236
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:57,007
They're supposed to protect us!

237
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,398
Usopp! Chopper!

238
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,061
[NAMI] What happened?

239
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,498
[NAMI]
No! Let me go! Stop it!

240
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,207
[panting heavily]

241
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,343
[NAMI] I can't move,
he's too strong.

242
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,184
Well, boys say goodbye.

243
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,122
Because today,
I'm gonna marry her.

244
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,195
[USOPP] Don't be stupid.

245
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,997
If I can't even
protect one woman.

246
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,436
Then I have no right
to call myself a man!

247
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,539
Usopp. So cool!

248
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,843
[CHOPPER] Wait, why does
Usopp have that weapon?

249
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,885
[USOPP] Take this!
Viper Star Six!

250
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:50,295
He's disappearing!

251
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,197
No.Not me too?

252
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,899
What's going on here?

253
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,337
Now Nami's disappearing?

254
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,172
[CHOPPER] Nami!

255
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,844
Where? I lost her

256
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,214
Huh?

257
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,317
I'm getting another
smell it's really strong.

258
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,020
[NAMI] Help me! Usopp! Cho--

259
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,588
Wait. Where,
where are you?

260
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,223
I can't tell!

261
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,060
[USOPP]
Answer me! Please!

262
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,498
[ABSALOM laughs]

263
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,668
The rest is up to you,
my loyal zombies!

264
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:34,139
Capture the intruders and
deliver them to Master Moria!

265
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,314
Damn, I still can't tell
where he's coming from.

266
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,019
[CHOPPER] Say something!
Nami! Usopp! Behind you!

267
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,091
Wha-whoa!
It's an armored zombie!

268
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,431
Oh crap! There's a
whole bunch of 'em!

269
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,935
What now?

270
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,503
Oh, no. This is bad.

271
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,206
A bunch of zombies are
coming from upstairs too!

272
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,374
[ZOMBIES] Hey, pirates.

273
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,311
Give up your shadows already!

274
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,379
Remember, Chopper,
we're the heroes here.

275
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,615
We can't have our shadows
taken away like the others!

276
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,916
Right!

277
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,256
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 351A]
Your shadows. Your shadows.

278
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,525
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 351B]
Shadows for our master.

279
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,497
Ah! Not painting zombies too!

280
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,536
[USOPP] You guys are cheating!

281
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,638
You can't die and
there's too many of you!

282
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:44,710
You gotta fight me
one at a time! No fair!

283
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,413
[ZOMBIE 351A] We just want your
shadow, man, don't freak out.

284
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,251
Hahaha!

285
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,053
[CHOPPER]
Ah, lemme go! You suck!

286
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,626
[USOPP] I'm the hero.
I'm the hero.

287
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,010
[ZOMBIES] Come back.

288
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,547
There's more?

289
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:26,418
[ZOMBIES] Just fork
over the shadows already!

290
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,542
[ZOMBIES] Shadows
for our master!

291
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,714
[USOPP] It's over!
We're done for!

292
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,484
[CHOPPER] But I like my shadow!

293
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,560
[ZOMBIE 351B] Whoa!
Hold up! Who's that?

294
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,099
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 351E]
Uh-oh, dude!

295
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,801
They just purified them!

296
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,414
[FRANKY] Get your filthy,
rotting hands offa my bros!

297
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,151
I ain't gonna warn
you again, got it?

298
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,053
[ZOMBIES] Yes sir!

299
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,698
These guys know our secret!

300
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,301
Who are they?

301
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,171
[CHOPPER] Big Bro!

302
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,539
[USOPP] Robin!

303
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,807
[FRANKY]
Hm?

304
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,215
[FRANKY] Damn. We're too late.
Lost Nami, huh?

305
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,551
It's okay. We'll save her.

306
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,186
Right, you two?

307
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,700
[BROOK] Even though
you are my shadow,

308
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,536
you don't understand the
importance of this afro?

309
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,572
You don't understand
why I must protect it?

310
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,709
I've lost my skin,
my eyes, my shadow,

311
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,744
but I can never give up my afro!

312
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,346
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

313
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,615
"A Belief Worth
Begging to Live For!

314
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,550
Brook Defends His Afro!"

315
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,752
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
