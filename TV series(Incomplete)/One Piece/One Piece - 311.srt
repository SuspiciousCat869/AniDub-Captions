1
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,829
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,332
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,303
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,306
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,407
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,810
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,213
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,650
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,686
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,155
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,559
The sea!

13
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,494
[ZORO] Usopp?

14
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,296
[USOPP] We're gonna be saved!

15
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,331
She came to rescue us!

16
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,099
Jump! It'll be okay!

17
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,101
We've still got
one more friend here!

18
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,637
Chopper! Did you see?

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,671
Yes!

20
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,076
Now. Cien Fleurs!

21
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,080
[ROBIN] Delphinium!

22
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,618
[LUFFY] I'm moving!

23
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,519
Is Robin doing this?

24
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,557
To the sea!

25
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,225
To the sea!

26
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,527
To the sea!

27
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,536
[USOPP]
Jump! Follow Luffy!

28
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,105
[NAMI, SANJI] Go!

29
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,674
[ZORO, CHOPPER, FRANKY]
Go!

30
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,210
[KOKORO, CHIMNEY, ROBIN]
To the sea!

31
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,813
All of the pirates
are jumping into the sea!

32
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,680
Ha!

33
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,182
There's no way
that they'll survive.

34
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,283
Those idiots are done for!

35
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,522
[MERRY]
Let's go back, everyone!

36
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,134
[MARINE 310T] Fire!

37
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,444
[MERRY] Back to
the seas of adventure!

38
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,582
[USOPP] Everyone!

39
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,786
Get onboard the Merry!

40
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,289
Merry!

41
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,528
[LUFFY]
Everyone Makes a Great Escape!

42
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,564
The Road to Victory
is for the Pirates!

43
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,534
[MARINE 311A]
What are they thinking?

44
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:03,704
If they jump in the ocean,
they're just gonna drown!

45
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,105
And they have
Devil Fruit users

46
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,273
with them, as well.

47
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,242
It's suicide!

48
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,076
Hold on.

49
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,678
Look at that!

50
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,047
Is that their ship?

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,048
[MARINE 311B]
It's gotta be!

52
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,784
See? It even has
Straw Hat's pirate flag on it!

53
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,252
[MARINE 311C]
How the hell did it sneak past

54
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,153
all our battleships?

55
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,309
I dunno who you are, pal,
but I sure owe you one.

56
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,084
This is weird.

57
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,498
What's going on, Sanji?
Something wrong?

58
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,433
Not wrong, just strange.

59
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,068
The rope ladder
got dropped down,

60
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,037
but it doesn't look
like anyone's here.

61
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,272
[NAMI] What?

62
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,473
[CHIMNEY] Yay!

63
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,641
[GONBE] Meow!

64
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:14,842
[USOPP] Merry!

65
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,678
[FRANKY] Seriously, can't
you swim on your own, brother?

66
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,715
Alrighty, up you go!

67
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,184
Hope you enjoyed the ride!

68
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,553
[SANJI]
Robin! Yoohoo!

69
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,056
Leap into my arms, darling!

70
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,157
Over here!

71
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,464
We're on the Merry!

72
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,832
We're back on the Merry!

73
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,702
I love you, Merry!
I love you so much!

74
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,737
Thank you!

75
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,373
[USOPP] Merry...

76
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,511
My sweet Merry is still alive!

77
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,079
[USOPP] I don't understand!

78
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,248
How did she make it here? How?

79
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,382
[CHOPPER] I wish--

80
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,385
I wish I could give
you a hug, Merry,

81
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,054
but I can't move!

82
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,222
This doesn't make sense.

83
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,025
I saw this ship
drop into the ocean myself!

84
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,808
The question is,
who sailed it here?

85
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,710
We'll figure it out later.
Just get us out of here.

86
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,245
Right. Let me think.

87
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,479
[ZORO] Everyone ready?

88
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,514
[NAMI] Sanji, get up!
What're you doing?

89
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,252
[SANJI] Whatever you
want me to do, Nami sweet!

90
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,486
That was a close one!

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,823
I thought those battleships
were gonna blow me up for sure!

92
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:36,690
[LUFFY] Hey, Robin!

93
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,592
You saved me! Thanks a--

94
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:51,338
From now on,
leave everything to us!

95
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:05,585
[ROBIN]
Luffy, everyone, thank you.

96
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,490
Sure.

97
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,594
[GONBE] Meow! Meow!

98
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,498
Don't worry 'bout it.

99
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,706
That's nice,
but save the sappy stuff

100
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,142
til after we escape, okay?

101
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,544
[SANJI] You take that back,
you heartless bastard!

102
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,646
[CHOPPER] Yeah, you bastard!

103
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,215
[ZORO] If we sit around, we're
just gonna end up dead, stupid!

104
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,351
[SANJI] I don't care!
Apologize to Robin!

105
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,152
[CHOPPER] Yeah!

106
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,787
That's enough--
Both of you, stop!

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,487
Hey, wait.

108
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,256
Chopper! You're moving again.

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,726
Now that you mention it,

110
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,261
I guess I am moving!

111
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,331
I was afraid
I'd never get better!

112
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,200
Now apologize to Robin already!

113
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,501
Give up yet?

114
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,670
[ZORO] No! Never!

115
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,439
Okay! Let's go!

116
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,174
You guys ready to move?

117
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,675
[ALL] Yeah!

118
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,410
[SPANDAM] Pull it
together, you idiots!

119
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:06,313
Are you gonna just stand
there and let them get away?

120
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,514
If they're gonna
escape anyway,

121
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,650
we might as well
blow up Nico Robin, too!

122
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,185
But--But we're supposed to

123
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,786
capture her alive, sir!

124
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,088
[SPANDAM] Tragic, I know,

125
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,123
but that's what
Aokiji said to do.

126
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,226
Now all ships prepare to fire!

127
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,195
Admiral Aokiji said that?

128
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,163
All right, men! Take aim!

129
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,266
[MARINE 311D]
All ships, prepare to fire!

130
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,235
Repeat, prepare to fire!

131
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,639
[SPANDAM] Okay, so I lied,

132
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,507
but that's better than
letting them get away!

133
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,508
I'll make them pay
for what they've done!

134
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,580
[SPANDAM] Can't you load
those cannonballs any faster?

135
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,748
Do you want them to get away?

136
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,616
[FRANKY] So Spandam's
still alive, huh?

137
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,784
That sucks.

138
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,918
[USOPP] They're gonna fire!

139
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,354
[NAMI] Catch the wind
from starboard and head east!

140
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,223
[ZORO] We can't!
We're completely surrounded!

141
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,491
[USOPP]
All those big, scary cannons

142
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,359
and they're
aimed straight at us!

143
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,094
At this range,
with that many ships,

144
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,796
there's no way
they're gonna miss.

145
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,397
[MARINE 311D] Fire!

146
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,335
[USOPP screaming]

147
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,369
[USOPP] Help!

148
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,176
[USOPP] Wait, are they
firing at each other?

149
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,145
Their aim can't be that bad.

150
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,246
[DOBERMAN] What was that?

151
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,447
Where the hell are you aiming?

152
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,548
Something's wrong!

153
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,417
It's like the cannons
just did that on their own!

154
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,685
Don't make such stupid excuses!

155
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,322
[MARINE 311E]
Change course!

156
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,423
[MARINE 311F]
We can't! It's too late!

157
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,562
[yelling]

158
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,800
[MARINE 311G]
They're coming straight at us!

159
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,101
We're gonna crash!

160
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,504
[panicked yelling]

161
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,505
This is madness!

162
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,307
What the hell is going on here?

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,075
Look over there, sir!

164
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,480
[MARINE 311H]
The Gates of Justice

165
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,249
are closing for some reason!

166
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,184
[MARINE 311I] The gate can't
block the current anymore!

167
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,418
With these whirlpools around,

168
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,220
we won't be able
to control the rudder!

169
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,256
[MARINE 311H] So that's
why our aim was so bad.

170
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,757
[CAPTAIN 311A]
Don't get sucked in!

171
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,060
Ugh, this day keeps
going from bad to worse!

172
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,165
[MARINE 311J]
Put out the fire! Quick!

173
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,634
[MARINE 311K]
We're gonna have to jump ship!

174
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,668
We're finished!

175
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,237
Those damn fools!
Why did they close the gate?

176
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,373
Hurry the hell up
and open it again!

177
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,474
[MARINE 311H]
We can't, sir.

178
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,277
The operation lever is
on the Bridge of Hesitation.

179
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,345
It wasn't our fault!

180
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,047
[SANJI] That turned out
better than I thought!

181
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,981
Sanji!

182
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,316
Is that what you did
while you were gone?

183
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,118
[SANJI] Mm-hmm.

184
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,619
I figured it'd take
more than just guts

185
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,487
to get out of here alive.

186
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,727
Bingo!

187
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,198
You're like
my hero forever, Sanji!

188
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,667
Are you a genius or what?

189
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,569
It's a little early
to be kissing his ass.

190
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,771
These whirlpools
are a problem for us, too!

191
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,406
[USOPP] Oh great,
thanks a lot, Sanji!

192
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,473
Would you shut up?

193
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,208
It's not a problem.

194
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,177
[NAMI] As long
as we're together,

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,648
there's no sea that the
Going Merry can't cross, right?

196
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,617
[SANJI] You're so cool, Nami!

197
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,484
[USOPP] That's right!

198
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,386
Go for it, Navigator!

199
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,522
[NAMI] Just hold them off
while I find a path for us!

200
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,189
[CHOPPER, USOPP, SANJI, ZORO]
No problem!

201
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,633
[ZORO] One-Sword Style...

202
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,101
...Thirty-six Caliber Phoenix!

203
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,308
Since I lost a sword,
I can't do a full 108 Phoenix.

204
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,110
Why don't you
go cry about it?

205
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:24,712
--I'm gonna make you cry!
--Hey guys,

206
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,346
here they come again!

207
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,784
[SANJI] Collier Shoot!

208
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,690
[ROBIN]
Cien Fleurs! Defense!

209
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,296
[FRANKY] We don't want 'em!

210
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,630
Take 'em back!

211
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,801
It's my turn!

212
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,738
Triple... Flame... Stars!

213
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,541
I sure hope the guys
are okay up there.

214
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,409
Me, too.

215
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,310
Meow!

216
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,112
[NAMI] It's fine, Chopper.

217
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,147
After all we've been through,
they won't lose now.

218
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,815
Just focus on
steering the ship, okay?

219
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,516
Uh, right.

220
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,019
Yah!

221
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,298
[SPANDAM] Damn it!
Why do you idiots keep missing?

222
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,532
It's right there!

223
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,802
We've got like a million cannons
firing at that stupid thing!

224
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,138
It's just one little ship!

225
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,639
[ZORO]
They're coming your way, Usopp!

226
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,574
[USOPP] I got it!

227
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:27,775
No, wait, I missed one!

228
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,376
Sanji, help!

229
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,744
[SANJI] Basses Côte!

230
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,347
Ah, guys!
Save some for me!

231
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,282
I wanna fight 'em, too!

232
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,417
Oh really?

233
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,518
Are you gonna
squirm them to death?

234
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,588
[SANJI] Hate to break
it to you Captain,

235
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,222
but I think this one
is our battle.

236
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,090
Take a nap!

237
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,492
We'll be done soon!

238
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,732
[LUFFY] You go take a nap!

239
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:55,469
I'm gonna beat
these guys, you'll see!

240
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,470
I just gotta get there!

241
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,275
I'll give a medal to
anyone who can hit them!

242
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,676
One shot is all it takes!

243
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,713
All ships, concentrate
attacks on their back deck!

244
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,748
Damn it, Luffy,
get out of the way!

245
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,782
[CAPTAIN 311D] Fire!

246
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,621
Shut up, Zoro!

247
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,223
You can't tell me what to do!

248
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,238
You ready?

249
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,505
Let's go!

250
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:34,908
[MARINE 311L] Uh-oh!

251
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,643
I think they're coming back!

252
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,485
You never let us down,
huh Captain?

253
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,620
I guess we needed you after all!

254
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,389
You people are monsters!

255
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,489
Uh-huh!

256
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,230
[NAMI] I've got it.

257
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,132
The path to victory!

258
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,700
[NAMI]
Chopper, helm hard to port!

259
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,634
9 o'clock!

260
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,135
[CHOPPER] All right, you got it!

261
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,239
[MARINE 311M] They're pulling
towards the waterfall!

262
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,240
What should we do?

263
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,608
[SPANDAM] Just shoot them!

264
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,443
What the hell do you think?

265
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,111
How hard can it be?

266
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,746
Sink that damn ship!

267
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,747
[MARINE 311M]
They're riding the current

268
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,514
of the whirlpool!

269
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:17,084
It's no use!
We can't keep up!

270
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:17,651
All right!

271
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,486
I get to be useful, too!

272
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,488
You can do it,
reindeer dude!

273
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,489
Meow!

274
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,391
Let's go!

275
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,561
Full speed ahead!

276
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,751
[SPANDAM] Damn it!

277
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,554
Damn it! Those bastards!

278
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:55,422
[SPANDAM] I have the
power of Enies Lobby--

279
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,157
The power of CP9!

280
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,660
[SPANDAM] I even had the
power of a Buster Call!

281
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,496
They practically burned
the whole island down!

282
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,665
And yet,
even after all that,

283
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:07,034
even after all I've done,

284
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:11,338
I can't take a single woman away
from a tiny band of riffraff!

285
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:16,009
It's not fair!

286
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:41,068
[SPANDAM muffled screaming]

287
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,136
[CAPTAIN 311E] Chief Spandam!

288
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:46,239
[SPANDAM muffled screaming]

289
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,215
[SPANDAM] You get to play a part
in the rebirth of this world!

290
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,518
Isn't that enough for you,
you insolent witch?

291
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:03,691
[SPANDAM] There's no hope for
you, so just give it up now!

292
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:06,060
[SPANDAM]
Sad enough to make you cry, huh?

293
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:11,464
[laughing]

294
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,038
[SPANDAM] Help me!

295
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:23,343
Please, someone help me!

296
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,246
[ROBIN] Clutch!

297
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,019
Hey! Chief Spandam!
Are you okay?

298
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,560
[CHIMNEY]
Yeah! Go!

299
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:40,494
--Yeah! Go!
--Well...

300
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,528
--Yeah! Go!
--I guess that settles that.

301
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:44,765
All right, Franky.
It's time to do your thing!

302
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,199
[FRANKY] You got it!

303
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,742
Get ready kids,
'cause this is gonna be wild.

304
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,676
[CAPTAIN 311F]
Block their path!

305
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,545
Don't let them get
out of the whirlpools!

306
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,346
Just so you know,

307
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,415
this might bang up
your ship a bit.

308
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,117
Sorry 'bout that.

309
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,186
Coup de Vent!

310
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,455
Wait, what?

311
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,424
The pirate ship is flying?

312
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,426
[MARINE 311N] How are
we supposed to top that?

313
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,661
[MARINE 311O] Our cannons
can't reach that high!

314
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,431
If you think the Merry's
an ordinary ship,

315
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,499
then you're wrong!

316
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,600
She's flown through the air once

317
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,769
and she can do it
again no problem!

318
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:25,038
Special attack--
Super Smoke Star!

319
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,710
[MARINE 311O]
It's a smokescreen!

320
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,414
[USOPP laughing]

321
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,118
Damn pirates!

322
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,154
Go! Don't let them get away!

323
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,188
We can't, sir!

324
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,756
It's taking all we've got
just to stay afloat!

325
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,191
We gotta get out
of this whirlpool first!

326
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,134
Maintain fire! Don't stop!

327
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:06,046
[ZORO] Hmph.

328
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,401
[ZAMBAI] Looks like the
Straw Hats are safe and sound!

329
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,235
Good!

330
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,670
Now let's get
the hell outta here!

331
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,438
All of your men
are onboard, right?

332
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,439
Of course!

333
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,108
We packed the injured
people into the cars,

334
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,110
so they're nice
and snug right now!

335
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:37,344
Okay!

336
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,613
It's gonna be a rough ride for
you folks outside the train,

337
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,514
so you better hang on tight!

338
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,098
It's all over.

339
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,167
We're still alive.

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,068
Yeah.

341
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,670
We survived the Buster Call.

342
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,172
It's strange,
watching their island burn

343
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,341
from the fire
of their own ships.

344
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,510
[LULU] But now that
Enies Lobby is gone,

345
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,479
maybe the Govnerment won't get
in our business quite as much.

346
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,048
That should be good for Iceberg.

347
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:15,282
[TILESTONE] I hope you're right.

348
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,051
[PAULIE]
Hey! Hey! Stay out!

349
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,085
Get away from me!

350
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:20,120
We never would've made it
without your ropes!

351
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,289
I didn't know you were
such a hero, Paulie!

352
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:24,058
If there's anything
we can do to repay you,

353
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,326
just say it, okay?

354
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,293
Yeah?

355
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:28,295
You can start by getting
your hands offa me!

356
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,564
He's so innocent!
Isn't it the cutest thing?

357
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,600
It just makes
you wanna cuddle him!

358
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:36,102
That's enough, you perverts!

359
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:40,140
[KIWI] Aw, are you
having a hard time?

360
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,508
[MOZU] You poor thing!

361
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,475
We'll take care of you!

362
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,113
[PAULIE] I'm beggin you,
please, have mercy!

363
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:50,551
[cheering]

364
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,353
[ZAMBAI] Let's go, Puffing Tom!

365
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,222
We're heading home!

366
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,098
[DOBERMAN] I didn't
realize you were here, sir.

367
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:06,333
We haven't given up
the chase yet.

368
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,569
[DOBERMAN] I swear
it won't end like this!

369
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,205
[MOMONGA] We must maintain
our dignity as the Navy--

370
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,307
No, as the World Government!

371
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,476
[STRAWBERRY] We'll bring down
the Straw Hats at any cost!

372
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,611
Nico Robin is in
the palm of our hand.

373
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,447
We can't let her escape
again after all we've done!

374
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,716
[ONIGUMO] Admiral, allow us
to call in reinforcements

375
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,085
and we'll overtake them
as quickly as possible!

376
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,053
[AOKIJI] Don't bother.

377
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,054
[ONIGUMO]
But sir--

378
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,089
The force that we command
with a Buster Call

379
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,126
is as powerful as an
entire nation's military.

380
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,094
And yet, look at
the state of our fleet.

381
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,430
Look at Enies Lobby,
burning to the ground.

382
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:39,333
The situation
is obvious, isn't it?

383
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,235
The day is lost, men.

384
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,204
We've been utterly defeated.

385
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:47,174
[KOKORO] You sure you wanna sit
up on top of that sheep head?

386
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,275
[LUFFY] Of course I do.

387
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,277
That's the Captain's seat.

388
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,412
[KOKORO] Well, there you go.

389
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:52,680
Careful not to fall.

390
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,148
[KOKORO laughs]

391
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:55,249
Sure.

392
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,384
Thanks for the help, Monster
Granny, you're the best.

393
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,322
And thank you, Merry.

394
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,691
We never would've
made it if you weren't there.

395
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,293
[LUFFY] I was pretty
surprised when you showed up,

396
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,194
but when I think about it,

397
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,597
you've always been
there to protect us.

398
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,799
We've always counted on you.

399
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,400
Anyway, I'm just
happy you've been

400
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,169
part of the team, Merry.

401
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,638
You're a good friend to have.

402
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,140
[FRANKY] I don't
mean to spoil the mood,

403
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,310
but damn, you guys did
some crazy stuff back there.

404
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,278
[FRANKY] I don't
think the government's

405
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,080
gonna let you off that easy

406
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,514
after you burned
down their flag.

407
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,383
[LUFFY] Eh, whatever.

408
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,386
It doesn't feel
like a big deal to me.

409
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,355
The only reason
I did any of that

410
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:38,292
was 'cause they took our
friend and I wanted her back.

411
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,460
And we couldn't
have done what we did

412
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:42,429
without your help,
so thanks a lot.

413
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,132
Well, like you said, it
wasn't really that big o' deal.

414
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:46,800
I just did what I had to do.

415
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,504
[LUFFY] The point is
we're all together,

416
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,506
we're coming back in one piece,

417
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:57,211
and this fight was our victory!

418
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:59,713
[ALL] Yeah!

419
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,396
[LUFFY] Merry.

420
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:17,464
Merry.

421
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,199
Merry!

422
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,468
Your name is the Going Merry,

423
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:26,774
and you're one of us,
once and for all!

424
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,676
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

425
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,110
Thank You, Merry!

426
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,346
Snow Falls over the Parting Sea.

427
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:35,048
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
