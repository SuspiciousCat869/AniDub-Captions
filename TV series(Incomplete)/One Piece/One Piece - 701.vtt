00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:34.743
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:37.414
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:37.447 --> 00:02:41.389
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:44.395
Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:45.898
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.338
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:53.680
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:57.889
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:02:57.922 --> 00:02:59.593
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:01.697
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:04.268
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.574
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:09.546
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.449
and challenged all
present to a game.

00:03:11.482 --> 00:03:12.785
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.156
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.161
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.264
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.302
Now, the relationship
between Law

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:24.274
and Doflamingo's brother,
Corazon, is unveiled.

00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.335
[stomach grumbles]

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.009
[BUFFALO]
Everyone, it's time to eat!

00:04:21.657 --> 00:04:24.563
That blond bastard's crazy!

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:27.200
Hey, we were looking for you.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:28.403
If you'll follow me,

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:30.140
Doffy would like to
have a word with you.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:32.712
I got some words for him, too!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.219
What in the hell?!

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:40.360
[LAW screams]

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.342
Man, you really hate kids.

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.614
Show a little compassion.

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:57.460
[LAW]
I'll kill him!

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:09.752
I was thinking Rakesh
should be our next target.

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:11.523
They think I'm blind
to the fact that

00:05:11.556 --> 00:05:13.092
they're allying
with us one minute

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:17.400
then shaking hands with another
crew when I turn my back.

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.374
Breaks my heart,
but I might have to

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:22.879
make an example of them.

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.452
Huh?

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.794
Yes, boy? We're enjoying dinner!

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:37.007
Show that tramp the door.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.942
[DOFLAMINGO]
Have a seat.

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:39.312
[ALL]
Hm?

00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:40.515
[DOFLAMINGO]
I called for him.

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.917
You did what now?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.491
[laughs] Hey, hey, Law.

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:47.394
It's been about a week, bud.

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:49.566
Bet you're here to
call it quits, huh?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.069
I can't really blame you.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:55.578
You've been Corazon's personal
punching bag since ya got here.

00:05:57.081 --> 00:06:00.555
I'm shocked a runt like you
stuck it out so long.

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:01.656
When things get tough,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.128
we usually see
the weaklings bail.

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.531
You've gotta have
some big stones

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.967
if you wanna run with us.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.469
Well I'm not going anywhere!

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.674
[PICA]
That's what they all say.

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:13.714
Remember, Squirt.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.653
We have a "Blood Law"
around here.

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:18.991
If Executives aren't
shown proper respect,

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:20.695
the Family falls apart.

00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.299
This one time, I cracked up
at Mr. Pica's voice

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:25.070
and they nearly
tortured me to death.

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:26.506
[BABY 5 laughs]

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.512
If you're trying to
scare me off, it won't work.

00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:31.950
I've already
experienced true hell.

00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:35.423
[chuckles] You play
a good hand, kid,

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:37.394
but I see through your bluff.

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:41.803
Regardless, Corazon is
my dear brother by blood.

00:06:41.837 --> 00:06:44.609
Should I find out anyone
lays a scratch on him,

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:48.517
let's just say,
it's curtains for them.

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.226
Look at his skin!

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.129
Keep away from us, boy!

00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:56.465
That's White Lead Disease!

00:06:56.498 --> 00:06:59.338
[gasps] I heard
that really hurts!

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:00.708
Is it contagious?

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.380
Leave before you infect us all!

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:04.983
[gasps]

00:07:05.016 --> 00:07:06.251
Stop, Giolla.

00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:08.691
You should know better than
to spout nonsense as facts.

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:11.262
Shame on you. Look at that.

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:13.534
You've wound Buffalo up.

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:15.303
It's caused by a toxin.

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.374
It can't spread
person to person.

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:18.544
Just stay away!

00:07:18.577 --> 00:07:20.213
I don't care how you get it.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:22.819
I'm not catchin'
your gross ass cooties!

00:07:22.852 --> 00:07:25.925
[DOFLAMINGO] Tell me.
Are you the last one left?

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:28.830
Or are there any other
survivors of White Town?

00:07:28.864 --> 00:07:32.203
Hell if I know.
I was busy escaping.

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.141
And how did you
manage to get away?

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:38.517
I hid in a mound of dead bodies
and snuck over the border.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.754
[GLADIUS]
C'mon, we're eating!

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:47.468
I bet you have an ax to grind.

00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:51.075
These days, I don't
believe in anything.

00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:52.210
Huh...

00:07:52.243 --> 00:07:54.616
And I'm not even afraid to die.

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:57.622
So, don't you go pressing
your luck with me, Corazon!

00:07:57.655 --> 00:07:59.091
I have nothing to lose.

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:01.997
And before my time comes,
I plan on taking you down.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.170
Are you that dumb?
Weren't you listening?

00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:08.811
We're not above torturing
kids here! So don't try it!

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:11.181
You should never
mess with pirates!

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:12.952
And crying won't save you.

00:08:12.985 --> 00:08:16.191
'Cause we're living in
a grown-up's world, okay?

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:26.800
Hey. So what's the deal

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.937
with that "White Town"
thing anyway?

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:31.676
[GLADIUS] It's another name
for the Kingdom of Flevance.

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:33.213
What do you want
to know about it?

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.516
[BABY 5]
What was it like?

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:36.118
[GLADIUS] It was a wealthy
place and everything

00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:38.957
from their soil to their
foliage was pure white.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.326
Visiting was like stepping into

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.132
a snow-filled
fairy tale kingdom.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:46.840
It was often described as
having an unusual beauty to it.

00:09:47.908 --> 00:09:49.713
[GLADIUS] One day,
they unearthed a type of metal

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:53.319
called "White Lead" just beneath
their kingdom's surface.

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:54.556
It was discovered that this was

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:57.494
the source of their
breathtaking landscape.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:58.997
They harvested this
metal and used it

00:09:59.031 --> 00:10:01.469
to make tableware,
paints, sweeteners,

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:04.141
cosmetics, and even weapons.

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:05.945
These unique products
drew attention

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:09.753
from all over the world
and became high in demand.

00:10:09.786 --> 00:10:13.861
This in turn made
Flevance's economy boom.

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:16.064
Even the World Government
took notice and profited

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:18.302
by helping to
export their goods.

00:10:18.335 --> 00:10:22.711
White Lead was a cash grab
for all those involved.

00:10:53.707 --> 00:10:55.578
[LAW'S FATHER]
Law. For this kind of surgery,

00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:57.682
you should focus on
these blood vessels.

00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:01.154
I get it! Thanks for
helping me out, Dad.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:05.029

Aww! Come on! That's no fun!

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:12.076

I said, later.

00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:18.723
Law. Listen to your sister.

00:11:18.757 --> 00:11:21.461
Taking a break can help
push you even further.

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:24.000
Sometimes you need to go out
and have a little fun.

00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:26.138
Maybe you should take
your own advice, Mom.

00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:27.575
You work too hard.

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:28.911
Oh, I know!

00:11:28.944 --> 00:11:31.415
What if we all went to
the festival as a family?

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:33.452
I'm not so sure.

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.423
What if you two took him?

00:11:35.457 --> 00:11:37.193
Huh?

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:38.229
I can't fight that.

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.233
Sound like fun?
Just 30 minutes though.

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:43.205
I still have a fair number
of patients to see today.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:45.010
Aww, yeah!

for your family.

[LAO G]
At one point in time,

00:11:54.996 --> 00:11:57.869
White Town was the
fascination of the entire world.

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.307
[BABY 5 gasps]
I wanna go there, too!

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:06.385
Regrettably, it's gone!
With a capital G.

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:07.387
Huh?

00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:25.023
[LAO G] A century ago, when the
White Lead industry first began,

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:28.897
the World Government surveyed
the land scrutinously.

00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:33.707
The truth is,
Flevance held a secret.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.043
What's the secret?

00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:37.313
[GLADIUS]
White Lead's toxic.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:40.486
If left intact underground,
it posed little harm.

00:12:40.521 --> 00:12:45.363
But once handled, it slowly
poisoned its victims.

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:47.467
People got sick?

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:50.841
It was worse than sick.

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:53.513
It caused erosion
to the human body.

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:54.916
[BABY 5 gasps]

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:56.954
[GLADIUS] Sadly, both the
government and the royalty

00:12:56.987 --> 00:12:58.824
were so blinded by
the incredible wealth

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:00.260
they were accumulating,

00:13:00.293 --> 00:13:03.299
that they brushed the
dangerous truth under the rug.

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:06.104
The citizens continued
to excavate the White Lead

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:07.841
without knowing the risks.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:10.881
So that means all those
poor people musta died?

00:13:10.914 --> 00:13:12.417
[GLADIUS]
That's right.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.558
And appallingly, the suffering
of Flevance's population

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:17.493
doesn't end there.

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:19.833
[GLADIUS]
Let's say a young man has even

00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:22.137
a trace amount of
lead in his body.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.408
If he eventually has offspring,

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:25.944
that child's life expectancy

00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:28.883
would already be
shortened at birth.

00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:32.157
[GLADIUS] And when that
child grew into an adult

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.127
and had children of their own,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.933
their lifespan would be
even shorter still.

00:13:37.735 --> 00:13:40.574
[GLADIUS] The life expectancy
kept reducing until eventually

00:13:40.607 --> 00:13:42.444
it reached Law's generation.

00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:44.749

making it to adulthood.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.557
[GLADIUS] Unfortunately,
by the time the world caught on

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.061
that White Lead was dangerous...

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.334
[GLADIUS]
...it was already too late.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:24.328
[LAMMY] Come on, this way!
You're falling behind! Hurry!

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.933
Now, Lammy. You don't
have to rush Law.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.839
But the festival
might end though!

00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:32.276
It's not going anywhere.

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:36.117
[LAW'S MOTHER]
Lammy?

00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:40.994
Lammy! What's wrong?
Are you okay?

00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:44.736
[gasps] She's pale!

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:46.371
[gasps]

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.048
[GLADIUS] Slowly their
population started to collapse,

00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:52.852
one after another.

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:56.192
Grandparents, mothers,
fathers, children.

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:59.064
The shifting life expectancies
caused the generations

00:14:59.097 --> 00:15:01.736
to fall ill around
the same time.

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:03.740
They all showed
similar symptoms.

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:08.884
Their skin and hair tuned white
as their bodies writhed in pain.

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:12.123
No doctor could
stop their suffering.

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:13.392
[LAW'S FATHER gasps]

00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:27.822
[BABY 5] So that means every
single person from his kingdom

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.357
died out then?

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.927
That's so sad.

00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:33.399
[SEÑOR] But then,
the real misfortune began.

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:34.668
[BABY 5]
Huh?

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:37.340
Thing is, the neighboring
countries watched this unfold.

00:15:37.373 --> 00:15:40.146
And with White Town's
population dropping like flies,

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.650
they made an assumption.

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:45.290
That White Lead Disease was
a highly contagious disorder.

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:48.630
They cut them off
in all directions.

00:15:48.664 --> 00:15:52.538
Isolating them, while ignorantly
turning a blind eye.

00:15:57.615 --> 00:15:59.485
[SEÑOR] With help from
the World Government,

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.591
their royals all safely
fled the country,

00:16:02.624 --> 00:16:04.929
leaving their citizens behind.

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:08.469
And when people from White Town
tried to escape that hell hole,

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.342
be it in search of treatment
or their own safety,

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:14.982
they were treated like monsters
breaking out of their cages.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.990
Shot on sight,
without hesitation.

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:24.936
Just one more injustice
covered up by those in power.

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:26.639
Dammit!

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:29.712
[SEÑOR]
They convinced themselves that

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:31.816
"it's their problem not ours."

00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:34.956
Guess that's humanity
for you, huh?

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:37.528
But Flevance didn't
go down without a fight.

00:16:37.561 --> 00:16:41.202
They had an abundance of lead
on hand, including bullets.

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.472
[RAKESH PIRATES scream]

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:47.380
[SEÑOR]
Naturally, war broke out.

00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:49.919
[SEÑOR]
This gave surrounding countries

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.956
the justification
to strike back,

00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:54.227
and they did so without mercy.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.199
I'm sure you can imagine
how that wrapped up.

00:16:58.135 --> 00:17:05.349
[FLEVANCE PEOPLE screaming]

00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:14.836
There you are!

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.940
Law! You must come with us!

00:17:16.973 --> 00:17:19.444
We encountered some
compassionate soldiers.

00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:21.917
They agreed to let
you children escape!

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:28.428
[FLEVANCE CHILDREN shouting]

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.638
[LAW] I can't. Not while
my little sister is dying.

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:34.107
I need to be there for her!

00:17:34.141 --> 00:17:37.547
Lammy's dying? I'm sorry.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:39.718
In that case,

00:17:39.752 --> 00:17:42.324
I'll ask them to save you
a spot on the next ship then.

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:44.161
I vow to come back for you.

00:17:44.194 --> 00:17:48.068
Law! You're not coming, too?
Now's our chance!

00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:51.241
Run away with us!
We'll come back for Lammy later!

00:17:51.274 --> 00:17:54.749
My mom and my dad
both died already!

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:59.191
But they told me to do
whatever I can to live on!

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:01.428
That's why I'm gonna
live no matter what!

00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:05.169
[FLEVANCE CHILDREN yelling]

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.046
[FLEVANCE NUN A]
It's okay. Don't forget.

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.584
Even in darkness, there's hope.

00:18:12.617 --> 00:18:14.187
Law, don't cry.

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.026
When times are
at their gloomiest,

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.165
just know someone's
watching over you.

[FLEVANCE WOMAN C]
Doctor, please help!

00:18:25.175 --> 00:18:27.080
I need a doctor!

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.986
That's impossible!
I can't make it there.

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.355
[LAW'S FATHER]
Please, we're short staffed!

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:33.425
Plus, we're in dire need
of blood donations!

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:35.396
There must be a way
to remove the White Lead

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.267
from a contaminated body!

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.371
It's not contagious either!

00:18:39.404 --> 00:18:42.711
Why won't the Government
address that yet?

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:43.379
Cuh-lick.

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:45.349
[LAW'S FATHER groans]

00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:52.130
I can't move, Law.
My body hurts everywhere.

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:55.369
And my skin keeps
getting blotchier.

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:58.643
Keep hanging in there, Lammy.

00:18:58.676 --> 00:19:01.883
Our father is the best doctor
in the whole kingdom.

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:09.298
Why is it so noisy
outside right now?

Another festival.
Flevance has always been

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:13.607
the kind of town that
likes to show off.

Anyway, get well soon so we can
go to the next one together.

No!

[SEÑOR] And just like that,
the beautiful "White Town"

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:03.846
Flevance was destroyed.

00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.994
In the end, greed always
comes out on top.

00:22:11.027 --> 00:22:13.265
If I went through that at ten,

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.870

in the head, too.

I'll do this quietly
and go unnoticed.
