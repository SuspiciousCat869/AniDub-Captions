1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,408
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,044
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,347
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,283
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,117
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,053
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,654
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,591
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,460
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:59,128
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,630
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:03,967
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,570
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,974
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,043
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:18,581
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,021
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,624
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:30,026
After soaring
through the sky for hours,

56
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,630
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women.

57
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:36,266
Its name was Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,135
[AMAZONS screaming]

59
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,770
[KIKYO] Don't let him escape!

60
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,406
[LUFFY] There she is! Perfect!

61
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,042
[NARRATOR] Luffy captured a Kuja
Warrior by the name of Margaret

62
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:49,279
and fled their village,
but could not escape the island.

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,581
If this keeps up much longer,

64
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,716
I'll end up growing
attached to you!

65
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,486
Hold on! Just stop!

66
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:03,159
I am Vice-Admiral Momonga
of Navy Headquarters!

67
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:07,063
Warlord of the Sea and
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock,

68
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,733
I have come for you!
Reveal yourself!

69
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,636
[HANCOCK] I already told you,
I like being a warlord.

70
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,339
However, I loathe
the World Government.

71
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,675
I have no interest
in following their orders.

72
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,377
Surely I can
find a better solution.

73
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,616
Love-Love Beam!

74
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:33,323
[MOMONGA]
Unless you reappear in two days,

75
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,692
your position will be revoked!

76
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,729
Do as you wish.

77
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:45,068
[LUFFY]
The Secret Hidden on the Backs.

78
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,637
Luffy and the
Snake Princess Meet.

79
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,546
[AMAZON 411A] Open the gate!

80
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:01,284
[AMAZON 411A]
The Snake Princess has returned!

81
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:06,255
[AMAZONS cheering
in excitement]

82
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,725
[AMAZON 411A]
We missed you!

83
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,560
[AMAZON 411A]
Welcome home, Kuja Pirates!

84
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,128
We're glad you're back!

85
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,733
[AMAZON 411B]
We love you, Snake Princess!

86
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,470
[AMAZON 411C]
Looking good, Ran!

87
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:21,738
[AMAZON 411D]
You're the best, Daisy!

88
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,540
We brought back lots of loot!

89
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,409
They're so awesome!

90
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,778
I'm gonna join the
pirates when I grow up!

91
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:39,255
[cheering continues]

92
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:41,457
It's the Gorgon Sisters!

93
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,362
[AMAZON 411E]
I love you, Snake Princess!

94
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,331
[AMAZON 411F]
Welcome home, Daisy!

95
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,639
[AMAZON 411G]
Ran! Daisy! Hey, Rindo!

96
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,374
[AMAZON 411H] Bluefan!

97
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,109
[AMAZON 411I] Cosmos!

98
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,212
Welcome home, Marigold!

99
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:05,314
Hey, Sandersonia!

100
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:06,682
They're really worked up.

101
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,751
They simply missed
our dear sister.

102
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,653
It was a lengthy journey.

103
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,288
Can you blame them?

104
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,593
She smiled at me!

105
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,595
No, she was smiling at me!

106
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:25,935
Welcome back, Princess.

107
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,671
We've prepared a
Monkey Carriage for you.

108
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,440
Is there anything to report?

109
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,609
No. Everything's fine.

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,781
[AMAZON 411K] Gently, now.

111
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,350
It's quite fragile,
carry it slowly.

112
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:44,954
Iron ore, gunpowder,
alcohol and northern crops.

113
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,956
What a truly impressive haul!

114
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,225
[RAN] Yeah. We plundered
a couple of merchant vessels

115
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,427
and one pirate ship.

116
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,463
Not to mention the
loads of cargo we claimed

117
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,665
from a central government ship.

118
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:58,534
You Kuja Pirates really are
a force to be reckoned with.

119
00:06:58,568 --> 00:06:59,735
Guess so.

120
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,704
Are you handling the
Snake Princess' gift?

121
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:02,939
Oh yeah, don't worry.

122
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,774
It's on the way
to the castle now.

123
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,443
[NYON]
Ran, did you collect any books?

124
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,314
[NYON] Down here.

125
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,683
[RAN] Granny Nyon! Books, huh?

126
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,885
Oh! We did appropriate
a recent newspaper

127
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,787
off the
Central Government ship.

128
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,489
Here. All yours.

129
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,559
Nyo my goodness!

130
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,665
[AMAZONS]
Welcome back, Snake Princess.

131
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,004
We're so glad to have
you home, Snake Princess.

132
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,473
Me, too.
It's nice to be back.

133
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:38,574
I thought you
might want to enjoy

134
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,443
your spoils of war,
so I've polished

135
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,378
the most exquisite jewel
from the batch for you.

136
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,412
[HANCOCK] Oh?

137
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,088
Oh, wow!

138
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,757
No jewel in the world
can compare to her smile!

139
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,362
But Snake Princess!

140
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,363
A gaudy rock like that

141
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,566
would be an unsightly
blemish upon my beauty.

142
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,503
[HANCOCK]
Enishida. What is this?

143
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,305
[ENISHIDA] Oh! I forgot.

144
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:10,973
The children of the
village lovingly crafted

145
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,544
a statue of your likeness
out of clay as a gift.

146
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,312
It's endearing
how much love and labor

147
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,281
they poured into its creation.

148
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,020
Well!

149
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,559
We made this to show
the Snake Princess

150
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,927
how much we love her!

151
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,397
It took them forever
to bring it up to the castle

152
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,365
because it would break
if they dropped it.

153
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,667
Don't you think it's cute?

154
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,002
[HANCOCK] Hmm...

155
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:42,805
It's me.

156
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,741
But made out of mud.

157
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,549
Snake Princess!

158
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,651
[HANCOCK] Don't bring
such filth into the castle.

159
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,953
It's inelegant!

160
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:59,655
Throw it away at once
and clean the floor.

161
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,724
[HANCOCK] I'm curious, Enishida.

162
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,492
Oh? About?

163
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,494
I couldn't help but
notice the city defenders

164
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,064
were absent from the
wharf upon our arrival.

165
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,970
Uh... Actually, you see...

166
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:15,738
A ferocious and violent monkey

167
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,473
came rampaging
out of the jungle.

168
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,941
The size and brute
strength of the beast

169
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,576
was simply astonishing.

170
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,979
So everyone has left
for the jungle to hunt it.

171
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,774
I see.

172
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,844
[LUFFY] Woo-hooooo!

173
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,748
There he is!

174
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,950
Take this.

175
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,158
Has the beast met his end?

176
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,926
Look! He's over there!

177
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,736
[APHELANDRA] Are all men
as stubborn as this one?

178
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,843
Do not think you
can escape your death.

179
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,647
It's no concern.
They'll be back shortly.

180
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,516
I am truly sorry they
weren't there to greet you.

181
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,884
[HANCOCK] No matter.

182
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,220
[ENISHIDA] Well then.
Would you care for a drink?

183
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,360
White sake.

184
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,529
[NYON] Gyo ahead and make
that two while you're at it.

185
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,564
[HANCOCK] Granny Nyon,

186
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,133
how nice of you to
defile my private chambers.

187
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,701
I didn't see you come in!

188
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,236
[AMAZON 411N]
How did you get in here?

189
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,172
Forget "how". I'm here.

190
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,574
Get rid of her.

191
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,044
Hold on!
Listen, Snake Princess!

192
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,256
[HANCOCK] You forgot "please".

193
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,259
Now say it.

194
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,931
Please listen, Snake Princess.

195
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,167
I have just learned that
there's a ship from Central

196
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,770
anchored off our shores.

197
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,705
They've come here
with the express purpose

198
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,241
of summoning you,
have they nyot?

199
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:19,745
The Central Government has
ordered you into active duty.

200
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,214
[HANCOCK] That's right.
They want me to go to war.

201
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,349
Why are you here?

202
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,084
You must go!

203
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,854
You must uphold the agreement
or they'll revoke your title!

204
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,057
I nyo you've just returned.

205
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,894
But surely you still
have the strength to fight.

206
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,629
I do.

207
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,130
But I'm afraid to go!

208
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,299
Aww!
She's like a widdle puppy.

209
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,135
Wait! I'm nyot fallin' for that!

210
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,804
[ENISHIDA]
That really got to her.

211
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,707
Nyow. Think this through.

212
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,078
All that is truly protecting our
nation is your title as Warlord.

213
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,347
[NYON] Our greatest
deterrence from outside forces

214
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,783
is Amazon Lily's location,

215
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,287
here in the Sea King-riddled
waters of the Calm Belt.

216
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,157
But as time marches forward,
so does technology.

217
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,927
And nyow these Central
dwellers have ships

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,764
that provide them with safe
passage through these parts.

219
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,999
We need a new weapon
to keep them at bay.

220
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,234
Your rank as Warlord

221
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,670
is the sole reason
they avoid our shores

222
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,740
despite the activities
of the Kuja Pirates.

223
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,874
[NYON] Think of your people.

224
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,911
Our island is home to
helpless children and elderly.

225
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,046
If you lost your title,

226
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,382
Amazon Lily would just be
another nation of pirates!

227
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,285
And the government
would bring ruin to us!

228
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,857
Now you're the one who
sounds like she's afraid.

229
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,660
[NYON] I am old.
I could drop dead at any moment.

230
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,663
Gaze into this crystal
ball and see your future!

231
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,832
Oh, my!

232
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,869
Her crystal ball is always
right about the future!

233
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,370
It's never wrong about anything!

234
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,039
I shall conjure
an image of your fate.

235
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:59,411
Nyon! Nyon! Nyon! Nyon!

236
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,982
Nyon! Nyon! Nyon!

237
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,784
Nyon nyon nyon nyon nyon!

238
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,118
[NYON] Your fortune!

239
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,430
You idiot.

240
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,900
[HANCOCK] Throw her out!

241
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,334
Right now!

242
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,270
Yes, of course, Snake Princess!

243
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,472
Wait, hear me out!

244
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,740
Nyot so rough!

245
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,976
[HANCOCK] I listen respectfully
and you treat me like a fool.

246
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,412
Did you think I'd fall
for your chicanery?

247
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,149
Your reign here ended well
over three generations ago.

248
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,218
How dare you act like
you're still the empress

249
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,786
of Amazon Lily...

250
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,722
...Gloriosa.

251
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,059
It doesn't matter what I do.

252
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,062
I could lay waste to every
inch of this nation of ours.

253
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,164
On a whim.

254
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,432
And still,

255
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,435
I would be forgiven
because I'm beautiful!

256
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,503
[ENISHIDA] Amazing!

257
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,072
She looks down on people
so much that she looks up!

258
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,208
[HANCOCK] Why on earth
should I listen to the words

259
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,810
of a disgraced ruler
who abandoned her people

260
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,779
to journey the outer seas?

261
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,981
Traitor to the Kuja!

262
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,084
So I live alone in penance
on the outskirts of town!

263
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,152
Nyon nyon nyon...

264
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,055
Which is where you should
be at this very moment.

265
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,290
Do not presume
to tell me what to do!

266
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,059
I'm the reigning empress!

267
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,561
[AMAZONS] Snake Princess?

268
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,464
[NYON]
Put me down already! Nyon!

269
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,532
That said,

270
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,202
I can't help but admire
your overwhelming passion.

271
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,837
You may be right.

272
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,107
[NYON] You agree to my request?

273
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,010
Thank you for understanding
the needs of your people!

274
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,979
How wonderful!

275
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,082
So. How soon
will you be leaving?

276
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,853
Never.
Know your place, fool!

277
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,121
Nyon!

278
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,891
[HANCOCK]
Now get out of my sight!

279
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,095
A curse on you,
Snake Princess!

280
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,864
Nyooooon!

281
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,534
[AMAZON 411K] Snake Princess...

282
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,104
[AMAZON 411L] You threw
an old woman out the window!

283
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,173
On accident.

284
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,308
Oh, of course!

285
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,310
We know it wasn't your fault!

286
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,279
[HANCOCK] Now clean up
all this broken glass.

287
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,513
[AMAZONS] Yes, ma'am!

I may be old, but I'm
still a Kuja warrior.

00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:56,171
My skills
haven't withered a bit.

293
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,410
I touched her.

294
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,679
Have you prepared
my bathwater yet?

295
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,348
Yes. I'll issue the

[ENISHIDA]
Your attention please!

298
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,621
The Snake Princess
will now bathe!

299
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:19,895
Now...

300
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:22,197
Stay still, I'm almost done.

00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,401
Whoa! Sorry!

302
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,975
[ENISHIDA] You must
evacuate the castle now!

Hey, come on, we've gotta go!

304
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:38,013
But I just sat down,
I'm still eating!

Come on, hurry everyone!

Get ready, girls.

309
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,462
They're clearing
out the castle now.

00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:55,431
It's about
to get packed in here.

311
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,279
[ENISHIDA]
For the next several hours,

312
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:14,349
no one is allowed to enter the
castle under any circumstances!

313
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,489
[RAN] What are you doing here?

00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:23,358
You know you're not allowed
past the barrier, right?

00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,593
Yeah.

316
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,929
But why's it such a big deal
when the Empress takes a bath?

317
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,865
Everyone acts like we're
going to war or something.

First things first,
how old are you?

Eight years old.

00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,038
Well, then I think
I can tell you.

00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,406
Wait, you don't mean...

00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,143
That's right.

00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,281
[HANCOCK] You're in
charge of keeping watch.

As you wish, dear sister.

[SANDERSONIA] Take your time.

You see, the
Gorgon was a monster.

328
00:18:00,796 --> 00:18:04,032
It stalked the tides
of the Central Oceans.

329
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,300
If anyone made the mistake

330
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,970
of gazing upon this
horrifying creature,

331
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,938
they would be turned to stone.

along a
treacherous journey,

The Snake Princess and her
sisters encountered the monster

335
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,414

00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,860
and it placed the

340
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,395
The penetrating eyes
of the monster

341
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:37,332
were etched across the
flesh of the sisters' backs.

342
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,170
So they remain,
forever staring, even today.

343
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,306
And if anyone gazes
upon these wicked eyes,

344
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,309
their body will harden
into stone and they'll die.

That's why the Gorgon sisters

refuse to remove their
clothing before another human.

they always post guards
when they bathe.

[LUFFY] That hurts!

353
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,645
Sounds like the
man's over there!

354
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:58,280
The snakes must have found him.

355
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:03,118
[LUFFY yelling]

356
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,587
Stop! Get off me!

357
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:15,864
[LUFFY yelling]

358
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:21,236
[LUFFY yelling]

359
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,905
Did you see where he went?

360
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,573
Yeah, he ran up
the side of the mountain!

361
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:25,641
You don't think he
could be headed back

362
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,775
to the village, do you?

363
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,177
I thought he was bound and
determined to find a ship.

364
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:30,212
What?

365
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,987
There we go.

366
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,323
Aw, jeez, that really sucked.

367
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,165
Okay, now what's next?

368
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:53,035
They'll come and shoot me
with arrows if I just sit here.

369
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,938
[LUFFY] But wait a sec.

370
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:59,474
Margaret did say
they've got a pirate ship.

371
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,045
I wonder... how hard
it'd be to borrow it.

372
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:09,451
That won't work.
Nami's not here.

373
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,653
I'd get lost in
no time without her.

374
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:15,724
I got it!

375
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:18,427
All I gotta do is ask someone
for a ride in their ship!

376
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,428
Wherever they're going,

377
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,431
I'm sure they won't mind
a quick trip to Sabaody!

378
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:26,101
So who am I
gonna ask for a ride?

379
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,537
Probably gotta be someone
important and high up.

380
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,671
And if they're high up,

381
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,507
that means they gotta live
in a tall building, right?

382
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:37,179
My head's on fire
from all this thinking!

383
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:41,149
Right! Guess I'll just try the
first tall building I can find!

384
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,752
Let's see...

385
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:45,253
That one'll do!

386
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:49,458
[LUFFY yelling]

387
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,194
[KIKYO] We need to hurry!

388
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,163
By this point, the Snake
Princess has probably returned.

389
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,299
We'll be in trouble
if she finds the man!

390
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,401
[LUFFY yelling]

391
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,139
You suck, roof!

392
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,307
[AMAZON 411T]
What was that?

393
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,309
[AMAZON 411U] The roof of
the castle tower collapsed!

394
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,111
Oh, no!

395
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,046
This is bad.

396
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,215
That's where the Empress
is taking a bath!

397
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,252
More water?

398
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:20,288
Why the heck is it hot?
Am I in a bath?

399
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:23,258
[LUFFY] I can't breathe,
I'm drowning, I'm gonna die!

400
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:28,463
It's real shallow. I'm safe!

401
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:33,101
[LUFFY]
This is... a huge bath!

402
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,514
A man?

403
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,454
Hey...

404
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,022
That thing on your back.

405
00:22:58,093 --> 00:23:00,295
It looks...

406
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,264
...kinda familiar.

407
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,101
You saw it?

408
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,644
[NARRATOR] Luffy is captured
once more after seeing

409
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,512
the Snake Princess' secret.

410
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,648
Margaret and her friends
try to defend him,

411
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:23,085
but Hancock is unmoved
and turns them all to stone.

412
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:24,519
Luffy is angry
to see the empress

413
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,254
petrify her own comrades,

414
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:29,224
but is powerless to help
as he faces his own execution.

415
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:30,625
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

416
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,194
Heartless Judgment!

417
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,129
Margaret is Turned to Stone!

418
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,565
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
