1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,575
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,577
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,812
across the seas in search
of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,581
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:47,650
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,420
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:51,888
after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,991
sets sail to become
the next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,861
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,429
they capture
the unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:01,264
of the World Government,

48
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,734
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,604
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:11,274
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,307 --> 00:03:14,377
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue.

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,979
The crew will
cut a path across

53
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,781
the Grand Line to
the New World!

54
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,987
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,956
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother Ace.

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,326
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison, Impel Down!

57
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,334
[JIMBEI]
So, Ace.

58
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,803
Will you tell me
what she said to you?

59
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,745
She said...
That my brother is here.

60
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,882
[BON CLAY]
Swan. Arabesque!

61
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,818
Been a while, Straw Boy!

62
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,888
Did you miss me, old pal?

63
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,425
[LUFFY]
"Warden Magellan's Strategy!

64
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,628
Straw Hat Entrapment Completed!"

65
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,633
Now Gum-Gum! Whip!

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,303
[BLUGORI groan]

67
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,307
[BON CLAY yelling]

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,643
Alright, Gum-Gum! Gatling!

69
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,414
[LUFFY yelling]

70
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,683
Spin! Spin!

71
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:27,917
[GUARD 433A]
From what we've gathered,

72
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,452
the following
prisoners are assisting

73
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:33,589
Straw Hat Luffy in his
infiltration of Impel Down.

74
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:40,096
Prisoner number E-8200,
Pirate Buggy the Clown.

75
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,399
Prisoner number D-0464,

76
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:49,906
Former Baroque Works
agent Galdino, AKA Mr. 3.

77
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,742
Prisoner number C-9915,

78
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:59,082
Former Baroque Works agent
Bentham. AKA Mr.2. Bon Clay.

79
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:02,952
Straw Hat Luffy and Bon Clay are
now in District N on Level 3.

80
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:06,789
The Blugori have failed at
every attempt to stop them!

81
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:07,790
[BON CLAY, LUFFY panting]

82
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:08,891
Hey, Bon!

83
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,627
How do we get down to
the lower levels from here?

84
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,063
[BON CLAY] Just a hop skip
and a jump to the other side!

85
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:16,666
By the way, thanks again
for sacrificing your life,

86
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,835
even if it turned out
you didn't really die.

87
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,536
Oh, come now!

88
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,105
There's no need to thank me!

89
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,073
Our lives are intertwined!

90
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,709
We were destined
to see each other again!

91
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,711
[BON CLAY laughs]

92
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,548
[beeping]

93
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,817
[GUARD 433C gasps] It looks
like Straw Hat and Bon Clay

94
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:37,520
are heading to
the staircase to Level 4!

95
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,155
[GUARD 433C] It appears--
Yes, we've lost track

96
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:42,392
of the other two, Buggy
the Clown and Galdino.

97
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,861
Report in if you
see either of them!

98
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,729
[PRISONER 433A]
Everyone on Level 2 is rioting

99
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,664
and that Straw Hat's
still on the loose.

100
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:50,433
[chuckles]

101
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,835
Dunno where this is headed,
but it sure is fun!

102
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,138
And here I thought
I was gonna die of boredom!

103
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,507
Only a matter of time
'til they get caught.

104
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,875
What a shame.

105
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,784
[buzzing]

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,662
[DOMINO] We appreciate your
understanding in this matter.

107
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:20,830
It's fine.

108
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,498
And with that, here you go.

109
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,400
Your cloak.

110
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,604
Thank you for everything.

111
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,640
Oh... Of course.

112
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,747
And one last thing.

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,015
Yes?

114
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:42,051
[HANCOCK] I believe there was a
report of an intruder earlier.

115
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:43,619
Is that correct?

116
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,488
Yes. So it would seem.

117
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:49,492
But Impel Down is an iron tight
facility so there's no escape.

118
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,027
[DOMINO] Now that we have
Warden Magellan on the case,

119
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,728
I can only assume
that the matter

120
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,564
will be handled very soon.

121
00:06:54,597 --> 00:06:55,465
[HANCOCK]
Splendid.

122
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,399
If they were foolish enough

123
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,534
to sneak into
the depths of hell itself,

124
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:02,839
it's only appropriate that they
become a permanent resident.

125
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:07,110
[HANCOCK] Magellan's power
is too terrifying to face.

126
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,545
I shudder to think...

127
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,748
I pray you have
the wisdom to run, Luffy.

128
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,684
What's Saldeath doing out there?

129
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,619
[GUARD 433D] Well, sir,
since the Blugoris can't seem

130
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,187
to beat Straw Hat or Bon Clay,

131
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,822
he took them all up to Level 2

132
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,558
to try and break up
the prisoner riot.

133
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,830
[PRISONERS scream]

134
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:36,906
[MAGELLAN growls]

135
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,774
Why do I only find
out about this now,

136
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,010
after things have
gotten so out of hand?

137
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,678
There was an earlier report,

138
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,714
but you were going
"ga-ga" over Hancock.

139
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:48,251
Accusing me of
negligence, are you?

140
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:49,719
What else would you call it?

141
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,855
You really need to take
responsibility for this.

142
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,023
[HANCOCK]
Warden?

143
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,825
I was wondering...

144
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:58,694
Would it be possible to
see the prisoner? Now?

145
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,963
Sure! Let's go!
Like, right now!

146
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,732
Warden! Wake up!

147
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,201
We kind of need you
to deal with this!

148
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,003
So yeah, your fault.

149
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,039
And now things are
completely out of control.

150
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,773
Warden!

151
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:14,110
Stop sighing!
You'll kill us!

152
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,312
Don't think I can do my job?

153
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,881
[HANNYABAL] No sir, you can
be quite effective!

154
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,589
[SADIE] Oh, it seems
your guests have departed.

155
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,224
Ah, yes, Mistress Sadie!

156
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,260
Salute the commander! Attention!

157
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:33,863
[SADIE] The riot is
being attended to

158
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,566
and my team is
ready for a hunt.

159
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,267
So what do you say?

160
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,211
You're the woman for the job!

161
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,179
Is someone stationed
on Level 3 now?

162
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:54,917
Minotaurus is on the prowl.

163
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,965
[MAGELLAN] That's a start,
but there are too many places

164
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:12,635
to hide on Level 3. It will
be difficult to corner them.

165
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:16,138
Let's leave the riot to Saldeath
and handle this on our own.

166
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,240
Excluding Saldeath's,

167
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,376
I want all forces in
the prison down on Level 4 now!

168
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,912
[GUARD 433D] Yes sir!
Of course, sir! Right away!

169
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:26,015
If Minotaurus fails us
and they do find the way down,

170
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:28,117
once they set
foot on this floor.

171
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,020
I will bury them
with my own hands.

172
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,121
[gaspsing]

173
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,723
All those who make a mockery

174
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:36,617
of this institution
will suffer for it.

175
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:45,126
[BUGGY panting]
Yep. Still hot.

176
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:49,196

[BUGGY] I'd rather be
cooked than skewered.

This is still the safest

It's too quiet around here

some kinda ambush.

00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,836
but it's all coming back now?
Something like that?

351
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,438
Sorry.

352
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,441
[BUGGY whimpers]

353
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,478
[BUGGY]
Ah. I see.

354
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,014
Well, uh... the, uh...

355
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:54,484
The Buggy Ball is this big
and powerful cannonball.

356
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:58,088
I guess you could say it's
kinda like my special weapon.

357
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:01,325
You know, the "Buggy Ball",
named after me?

358
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,294
[MR. 3] Well, all right, so
nobody knows anything about it,

359
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,563
but the point is you must
have a lot of confidence

360
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,899
in it to put
your name on it.

361
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:10,901
Okay, yes, and its just
as powerful as ever,

362
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,269
only now, I made it tiny.

363
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,571
In fact I have one with me

364
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:16,373
I call it the Muggy Ball!

365
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,175
[MR. 3]
Who the heck is Muggy?

366
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,277
[BUGGY] Either way,
take this, you bastard!

367
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,313
My special weapon,
the Muggy Ball!

368
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:33,890
[MINOTAURUS groans]

369
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:35,359
Whoa! That's awesome!

370
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,160
Nice shot, huh?

371
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:40,697
Heh.

372
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:42,933
A piece of cake
for the Muggy Ball.

373
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,269
Bring back any
memories, Straw Hat?

374
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:47,170
Won't forget that one!

375
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,074
[BUGGY growls]

376
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,981
[MINOTAURUS growls]

377
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,121
Holy crap!

378
00:21:04,154 --> 00:21:06,490
What is that thing made of?

379
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:09,159
Our turn, Straw Boy.

380
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:10,294
Hey, 3!

381
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,462
Are you sure you can't use your
Wax-Wax power down here?

382
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,232
[MR. 3] In this heat,
it'd melt in three seconds!

383
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:16,933
That will work.
Three seconds is plenty.

384
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,137
[BON CLAY]
Fly! Fly! I'm flying!

385
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,139
"Oh, Come My Way" Kenpo!

386
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:25,175
Memoirs of a Winter's Sky!

387
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,079
[MINOTAURUS growls]

388
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:31,581
[BON CLAY]
You ready, Straw Hat?

389
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:33,283
Candle Lock!

390
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,184
Alright!

391
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:36,553
[LUFFY]
Now Gum-Gum!

392
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,487
[MINOTAURUS growls]

393
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:40,557
Mallet. Rifle!

394
00:21:44,394 --> 00:21:52,202
[MINOTAURUS groans]

395
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,174
[LUFFY pants]

396
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:20,997
[ALL]
Yeah, we did it!

397
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:23,066
We really did it!

398
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,436
[ALL] We beat the
monster cow thing from hell!

399
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,504
[LUFFY]
All right!

400
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:31,274
Let's keep it up and get
to the bottom of Level 4!

401
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:50,360
[GUARD 433F]
Hello? Hello? This is Level 4.

402
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:53,697
All of our forces are rallied
together under Warden Magellan.

403
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,032
We're ready for
anything down here.

404
00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:04,141
[ACE]
Luffy, please.

405
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,042
Stay away!

406
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,754
[NARRATOR] For better or worse,
Luffy reunites with Buggy.

407
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:19,389
But shortly after
they team up

408
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,392
an accident sends them
plummeting into Level 4.

409
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,693
The situation then
becomes desperate

410
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,595
when they find that
Warden Magellan

411
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:29,132
and all of Impel Down's
forces were lying in wait.

412
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,567
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

413
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,335
"All Forces Have Gathered!

414
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,539
The Battle on Level 4,
The Burning Heat Hell."

415
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,674
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
