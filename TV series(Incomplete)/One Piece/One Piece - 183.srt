1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:04,512
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:10,310
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,825
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:38,296
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,217
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,097
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,477
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,354
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:59,317
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,361
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:07,117
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,007
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:26,761
[NARRATOR] The final phase
of Eneru's diabolical plan

25
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,680
is just about to begin.

26
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:36,521
[ENERU] Run as fast as you can,
people of the sky!

27
00:02:36,604 --> 00:02:39,024
This is Skypiea's last dance!

28
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:43,278
A party of angels
dancing in the sky! Haha!

29
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,364
You. Have you ever seen the
look on a mortal's face

30
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,450
when he suddenly
loses his footing?

31
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,745
[ENERU laughs]

32
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,540
[WHITE BERET I grunts]

33
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,961
Everyone! You have
to go to Cloud End

34
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:03,465
at the edge of the clouds
right away before it's too late!

35
00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:05,884
We have to escape
to the Blue Sea!

36
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:09,262
Eneru's planning to destroy
this land and everyone on it!

37
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:12,474
If we don't evacuate now,
we're going to die!

38
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:15,518
If we want to live,
we must leave!

39
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,103
[CROWD shouting]

40
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,814
[NARRATOR] While the citizens
began to evacuate Angel Island,

41
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:23,485
Luffy rushed off to his
inevitable showdown with Eneru.

42
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:32,202
[inhlaes] Hey! Are you
the one they call Eneru?

43
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,083
[cheers]

44
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:42,003
What makes you God anyway?

45
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,046
You'll find out.

46
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,422
[yells]

47
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:47,842
[ENERU]
El... Thor!

48
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,892
One hundred million volt.

49
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,269
Vari!

50
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:01,731
[NAMI] If I'd thought about it,
I would've realized it sooner!

51
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:04,567
Lightning can't hurt Luffy.
He's made of rubber!

52
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,945
[yells]

53
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:08,780
[groans]

54
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:11,241
[NAMI] Eneru must have never
imagined there was someone

55
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,993
in the world who was
immune to lightning!

56
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:17,956
Luffy may be the only person in
the world who can battle Eneru.

57
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,125
They're natural enemies!

58
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:27,090
[LUFFY] "Maxim Surfaces!
Deathpiea Is Activated!"

59
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:43,064
[BOTH gasp]

60
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:50,822
Rubber. It doesn't
conduct electricity!

61
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:55,368
And so that means, Eneru can't
hurt a rubber person!

62
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:02,292
Go Luffy! Stop him.

63
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,210
[ENERU grunts]

64
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,142
You! You're no mere mortal!
What are you?

65
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:24,397
Me? I'm Luffy.
A pirate, and a rubber man.

66
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,859
What? Rubber?

67
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:32,197
I see. Rubber doesn't
exist in Skypiea.

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,823
He doesn't know what it is.

69
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:36,993
That lightning of yours...
won't work on me!

70
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,453
Mantra.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,003
Gum-Gum... Whip!

72
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,260
[LUFFY]
Spear!

73
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:55,345
[NAMI yelps]

74
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:56,971
[gasps]

75
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:04,020
I don't believe it!
He can predict Luffy's moves!

76
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:05,188
[ENERU]
Heh.

77
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,149
[LUFFY grunts]

78
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,654
Luffy!

79
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:15,907
[LUFFY grunts]

80
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,328
Don't push your luck.

81
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,788
[coughs]

82
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,458
Lightning can cause far more
than just electric shocks.

83
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:28,545
But I don't have to tell
you that, "rubber man."

84
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,213
You found out the hard way!

85
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:35,010
[LUFFY grunts] You're gonna
have to do better than that!

86
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,473
[grunts]
I see!

87
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:43,893
He's got that weird ability
to predict my moves. Dammit!

88
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:47,772
Lightning won't work.
Blows won't work.

89
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,859
Just what is this "rubber"?

90
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:54,821
Now, hold on.
This "rubber man".

91
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:58,908
He's a paramecia.
Even they have weaknesses.

92
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:02,203
Gloam... Paddling!

93
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:05,957
[LUFFY]
Huh?

94
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,667
[ENERU]
I'm on a bit of a schedule,

95
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,878
so I don't have time to play.

96
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:16,176
He! He's changing
his staff into a blade!

97
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:22,557
[ENERU] Think of it as
lightning in solid form!

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,975
[LUFFY grunts]

99
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,894
[LUFFY grunts]

100
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,979
[ENERU laughs]

101
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:31,316
[ENERU] As I thought, slashing
attacks are your weakness!

102
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,192
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

103
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,737
[yells]
Don't tell him that!

104
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,282
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum Gatling!

105
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,076
[gasps]

106
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,285
[LUFFY]
Where'd he go?

107
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,163
[gasps]
Luffy! Behind you!

108
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:49,250
[LUFFY gasps]

109
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:52,253
He can move right
through... the gold?

110
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,969
[LUFFY groans]

111
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,349
[AISA, PIERRE scream]

112
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,728
[gasps]

113
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:12,565
[LUFFY groans]

114
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,194
[LUFFY shouts]

115
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:19,406
[laughs] You may be
immune to lightning,

116
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,866
but not to electric
heat it seems!

117
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,246
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...!

118
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,041
[LUFFY]
...Battle Axe!

119
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,504
[NAMI gasps]

120
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:37,465
[AISA, PIERRE gasp]

121
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:41,219
[ENERU]
You blasphemous brat!

122
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:46,933
All right! Gum-Gum... Gatling!

123
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:47,559
[ENERU grunts]

124
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,853
[LUFFY shouts]

125
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:54,733
[yells]

126
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:59,571
[ENERU] It's not as though
you grew more arms, Idiot!

127
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,577
Luffy!

128
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,580
[ENERU]
Sightseeing on sky island. Hmph.

129
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:13,043
You Blue Sea people certainly
picked a bad time to visit.

130
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:18,298
I am this land's god. I can
do anything my will desires.

131
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:22,552
I've long dreamed of
creating an ideal world!

132
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,471
This dream will
become a reality,

133
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,265
and I won't let anyone
stand in my way!

134
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:32,103
Least of all some whelp
from the Blue Sea world!

135
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:36,066
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes. How could I forget?

136
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,651
We were going to
watch this land die.

137
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,862
[laughs]

138
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,031
[gasps]

139
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,282
No! You can't!

140
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:49,204
[ENERU] Max. Two hundred
million volt Vari!

141
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,669
[LUFFY grunts]

142
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:03,218
[NAMI gasps]

143
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:07,472
[AISA gasps] Horsey-Bird!
What are we gonna do?

144
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:08,973
It's moving!

145
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:13,269
[PIERRE yells]

146
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:17,399
Luffy! Nami!

147
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:23,655
Behold! Maxim!

148
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:26,324
The ark that will take
me to Endless Vearth!

149
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:33,832
To the sacred land without end
that I desire! Rise Maxim! Rise!

150
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,627
[NAMI gasps]

151
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,552
It's... flying!

152
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:53,309
[NAMI] Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

153
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:54,978
This is bad!

154
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:57,605
[NAMI]
Luffy! Hurry up and stop Eneru!

155
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,941
But, wait a minute!
This ark's powered by Eneru,

156
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,318
so if he's defeated,
it'll crash with us on it!

157
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,863
But if he's not, the sky islands
going to be destroyed!

158
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,239
And if we stay here
and do nothing,

159
00:11:06,322 --> 00:11:08,658
we'll be taken to some
land far away with Eneru!

160
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,909
Oh, I don't like our options!

161
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:12,078
No matter what happens,
we still lose!

162
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,916
[NAMI]
What are we gonna do, Luffy?

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,752
I'm really scared!

164
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:27,927
[NAMI]
Huh?

165
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,555
[LUFFY]
Don't be. Just calm down.

166
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:33,475
Calm down? But how?

167
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,602
[LUFFY] You sail with
the crew of the future

168
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:38,021
King of the Pirates.

169
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:41,691
So wipe that frown off,
all right?

170
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,201
King of the Pirates? And what
domain does he lord over?

171
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:59,668
He's the king of the seas!
The greatest king of all!

172
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:04,964
[ENERU]
Hpmh! So you say.

173
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:08,510
But we'll soon learn if
that's true. Won't we?

174
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,426
[WOLF growls]

175
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,683
[AISA] Here, look!
The ship! It's stopped!

176
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,310
It's stuck in the Vearth!
It can't go any higher!

177
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:01,479
But look! It's scraping away!

178
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,940
It's only a matter of time
before it breaks through!

179
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:05,817
[PIERRE giggbers]

180
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,278
[AISA] No, we can't.
We'll get in his way!

181
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:09,863
He may be from the
Blue Sea world,

182
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:11,531
but Luffy's
still a warrior!

183
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,450
A warrior's duel is sacred!

184
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,493
You should never
interfere in it!

185
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,126
[SKYPIEAN A]
We're going to be cast down!

186
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:24,544
[SKYPIEAN B]
This is the end!

187
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,004
[SKYPIEAN C]
Run!

188
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,590
Quickly, folks! The White
Berets will ensure your safe

189
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,593
evacuation from the island!
There's no need to panic!

190
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,970
Proceed in an order--

191
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,264
[SKYPIEAN D]
'Scuse me!

192
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,184
[MCKINLEY] Please,
everyone hurry get moving!

193
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,686
We don't have much time left!

194
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,480
[MCKINLEY]
We have to.

195
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:46,107
We have to save as many
people as possible!

196
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,820
Uh! Sir!

197
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:54,449
Sir, what are you doing?
You have to escape now!

198
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:57,494
I've always believed in our god.

199
00:13:57,577 --> 00:14:01,956
If it's his desire to grant us
death, shouldn't we accept it?

200
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,627
Isn't it wrong if
we don't, Captain?

201
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,920
[MCKINLEY]
Eneru.

202
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,005
He doesn't have the
right to take your life

203
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,299
or anyone else's
for that matter!

204
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:16,680
Listen! We all have to survive!
And keep on living! All of us!

205
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,684
[MCKINLEY]
Now, please, sir, escape!

206
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,852
Live while you have the chance!

207
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,646
Grandfather.

208
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:26,231
Come on! Hurry!

209
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,946
Heso!

210
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,406
[SKYPIEAN E]
Captain!

211
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:35,782
[SKYPIEAN F]
A few of us are heading

212
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,326
to the Shandorian village.

213
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,828
[MCKINLEY]
The Shandorian Village?

214
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:41,079
[SKYPIEAN G]
If someone doesn't warn them

215
00:14:41,162 --> 00:14:42,914
about what's happening,
they'll perish!

216
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:44,457
[SKYPIEAN E]
We have to do it!

217
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,919
[SKYPIEAN F] The Shandorians
are people, too! Just like us!

218
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,423
[MCKINLEY grunts]
You're right! Go! Quickly!

219
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,304
[ENERU laughs]

220
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,390
[ENERU] The circuit to this
ark's ultimate function

221
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:04,644
has been initiated and is now
running at full capacity!

222
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,688
Ultimate function?

223
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:10,066
It has a name.
It's called Deathpiea.

224
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,944
The despair that will
destroy this world.

225
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:18,158
[gasps]
Oh, no! Luffy!

226
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:32,339
[ENERU]
Deathpiea, activate!

227
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,559

228
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:45,518
[NAMI]
What is that?

229
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:49,439
[ENERU laughs]

230
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:51,107
[NAMI]
A cloud?

231
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,404
[ROBIN gasps]

232
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:10,919
[gasps]

233
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:17,717
[ROBIN]
Clouds?

234
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,594
[SHANDORAN A]
Chief! Come quick!

235
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,387
[SHANDORAN B]
Something's happening

236
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,889
in the sky over Upperyard!

237
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,516
[SHANDORAN CHIEFTAIN]
What is it?

238
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,143
[SHANDORAN B]
It. It just suddenly got dark!

239
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,937
[SHANDORAN A] I've never
seen the skies over this island

240
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,814
look like that.

241
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,274
[SHANDORAN C]
Strange. What could it be?

242
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,318
Do you think something
bad happened to Wyper

243
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:36,695
and the warriors?

244
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,446
[SHANDORAN CHIEFTAIN sighs]

245
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,115
[SHANDORAN CHIEFTAIN]
I hope not, but I, too,

246
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,992
have never seen such dark
clouds in the sky of the

247
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,411
White-White Sea.

248
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:46,538
[SKYPIEAN A]
Wh-What is that?

249
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:49,749
[SKYPIEAN B]
The sky! It's growing dark!

250
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,169
[SKYPIEAN C] It's the judgment!
This is the end!

251
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,255
[gasps]

252
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:56,923
[NAMI]
Are those...?

253
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,468
That's right. Thunderclouds.

254
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,722
Using my energy, Deathpiea
forces extremely turbulent air

255
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,683
currents together, which produce
those lovely thunderclouds

256
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,810
you see billowing out right now.

257
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,353
[NAMI]
Thunderclouds?

258
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:13,606
[ENERU] Soon they will envelop
all of Skypiea in darkness.

259
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,067
Inside them, energy will
continue to build

260
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:18,528
until it's reached
its absolute peak.

261
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,990
And then, on my signal,
they will unleash thunderbolts

262
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,492
of such magnitude that
every trace of this land

263
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,619
will be obliterated!

264
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,164
Allow me to demonstrate.

[CROWD scream]

266
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:45,597
That came from Upperyard!
Get to the ships!

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,974
Everyone, keep calm!
Don't panic!

268
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:50,435
Get on a ship and
head for Cloud End!

269
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:56,775
Damn you!

00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:18,254
You... just...

274
00:18:18,338 --> 00:18:20,674
[ENERU] I just teased
the angels a little.

275
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:23,301
But after all, that is my right.

276
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:27,639
So being a god makes it
okay to destroy everything?

277
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:31,601
Of course. Everything here
is mine for the taking.

278
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,561
Their land. Their lives.

279
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,563
Speaking of which...

280
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,650
I'll continue celebrating
by taking yours!

00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,902

282
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:47,283
[LUFFY yelps] Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Hot! Hot!

283
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:51,496
[laughs] This spear has
been highly charged!

[LUFFY grunting]

285
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,724
[LUFFY]
Dammit!

286
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:17,647
How. How can I defeat a guy,
who can predict my moves?

287
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,817
[gasps]
Yeah!

288
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,654
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

289
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,531
..Daze...

290
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:29,451
What are you doing? Hey!

[grunts]

293
00:19:41,171 --> 00:19:43,131
[NAMI] He's dodging the
attacks unconsciously

294
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:45,216
and just relying
on his reflexes!

295
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,635
It's almost like he's a
blade of grass that sways

296
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,138
back and forth in the wind
instead of opposing it!

297
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:53,975
He's not thinking! That's why
Eneru can't predict his moves!

298
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,936
[NAMI]
Huh?

299
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,523
[pants]

300
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:06,905
But if I switch my brain off...
Then I can't attack him!

301
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,281
Don't stop now!

302
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:10,867
I gotta get my hands on
him somehow. Come on! Think!

303
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,244
There's gotta be a way.

304
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,746
That's it!

305
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,337
Gum-Gum... Octopus!

306
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,841
[NAMI screams]
Enough with the stupid ideas!

307
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,429
[ENERU] I take it you're no
fan of my Mantra, are you?

308
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:35,975
That's to be expected, since it
is the basis of my power!

309
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:39,020
That place should work!

310
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,272

It doesn't matter what you try.

312
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,526
Except for your
immunity to lightning,

313
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,778
you're nothing but an annoying,
powerless mortal!

[LUFFY]
...Octopus...!

315
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,949

[LUFFY yells]

318
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:00,542
[ENERU] You're ignoring me and
attacking the ship instead?

319
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,962
It's no use! You're even more
foolish that you appear!

[gasps] Of course!
The punches are ricocheting.

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,660
He's not consciously
controlling them!

you get away again!

<i>Don't give up on your dreams,</i>
<i>through endless nights</i>

344
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,303
<i>they come to you</i>

345
00:23:17,387 --> 00:23:22,767
<i>Again and again, until you</i>
<i>see them shining through!</i>

346
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:28,648
<i>You may not return,</i>
<i>I hope that you'll learn</i>

347
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:35,363
<i>to put your past behind,</i>
<i>and just keep moving on</i>

348
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,581
[ENERU] Once you're gone,
the world will be mine!

349
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,416
[LUFFY] Shut up and
fight me, Eneru!

350
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,626
[ENERU]
Look around you, rubber man!

351
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,546
This island is being destroyed
right before your eyes!

352
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,215
[AISA] What should we do!
The ship's flying away!

353
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,717
[NAMI] Where's the fun
in gaining everything

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,510
you want all by yourself?

355
00:23:57,594 --> 00:23:59,220
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

356
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,016
"Luffy Falls! Eneru's
Judgment and Nami's Wish!"

357
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,518
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
