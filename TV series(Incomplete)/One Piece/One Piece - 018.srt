No! I wasn't reminiscing

173
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,547
about the old days!
Enough of that kinda talk!

174
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,948
I don't wanna hear about
the old days! Got it?!

175
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,417
Are you nuts? You're the
one who brought it up.

176
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,886
You faker! You sound too
dumb to be a god!

177
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,721
[STRANGE VOICE] Shut up!
If you won't leave,

178
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,391
then prepare for my
divine judgment!

179
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,495
[ZORO snores]

180
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,568
You're really pushing
your luck... "god".

181
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,436
[STRANGE VOICE]
How are you not dead?!

182
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,438
‐‐[LUFFY] There you are.
‐‐[STRANGE VOICE] Don't move!

183
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,740
[STRANGE VOICE]
I said don't move!

184
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,642
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

185
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,780
[STRANGE VOICE]
No! That can't be!

186
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:41,847
Hey "island god".

187
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,617
Even mortals know bullets
can't hurt a rubber man!

188
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,752
Maybe not, but I
still hate them.

189
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,622
[STRANGE VOICE]
You're some kind of monster!

190
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,590
Over there!

191
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,991
[LUFFY grunts]

192
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,926
Hey, look. Found his gun.

193
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,604
Where did he go?

194
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,608
[NAMI, USOPP]
Huh?!

195
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,875
[LUFFY]
What is this?

196
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,979
[USOPP]
Could it be the island god?

197
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,013
[LUFFY, NAMI gasp]

198
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,114
It's moving!

199
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,049
[STRANGE VOICE grunts]

200
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,125
Stand me up!

201
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,460
Stand me up already!

202
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,494
[NAMI]
It's a person!

203
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,063
[LUFFY] Awesome! He's like
a talking scrub brush!

204
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,733
That's it? You're not
even a minor deity.

205
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,368
You're more like a box.

206
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,637
Come on! Stand me up now!

207
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,905
[USOPP]
Relax. Here.

208
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,808
Uh... I'll let you off
with a warning this time!

209
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,809
[LUFFY]
No. Wait!

210
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:48,414
[STRANGE VOICE grunting]

211
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,516
[LUFFY groans]

212
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,019
[BOTH yell]

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,557
‐‐[screaming]
‐‐[LUFFY laughing]

214
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,825
[NAMI, USOPP]
Luffy!

215
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,495
[LUFFY]
Huh!

216
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,597
[screams]

217
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,238
[NAMI, USOPP gasp]

218
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,627
There. You're all set now.

219
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,966
[NAMI] You're a pretty
popular guy, Mr. Island God.

220
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,402
So lemme get this straight,
these crazy animals

221
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,403
helped you scare
off the pirates

222
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,305
who came to this place
looking for treasure?

223
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,707
[LUFFY]
I've never seen a person

224
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,975
stuffed inside a
treasure chest before.

225
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,144
You're a real life
"jack in the box".

226
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,881
Yes. Ironically I am in fact
in a box, and my name is‐‐

227
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,149
You idiot!

228
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,885
I'm a person! Not a toy!

229
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,887
I've been stranded,
alone, on this island,

230
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,324
and stuck in this contemptible
box for 20 years.

231
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,226
That long?

232
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,670
So you've been all alone on this
island for 20 years? Amazing.

233
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:21,440
Yeah, just take a look at me.
I got a beard like a wild man.

234
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,076
And in all that time,
you're the first people

235
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,278
that I've had a real
conversation with.

236
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,681
Can you understand
how painful that is?

237
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,749
[LUFFY]
That's ridiculous.

238
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,784
What did you say?!

239
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,986
Oh, oh... here you are.

240
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,921
I've been looking all
over for you guys.

241
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,323
[NAMI] How could you
have slept through

242
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,991
everything that's
just happened?

243
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,967
[ZORO gasps]

244
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,836
What the heck is that?!

245
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,304
He finally sees him.

246
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,373
Check it out!
He's in a treasure chest.

247
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,809
Like a "jack in the
box". But real!

248
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,346
Yes. Ironically I am in
fact in a box and my name is‐‐

249
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,447
You idiot!

250
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,449
We've already been
through all that!

251
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,885
[LUFFY]
Zoro! Gimme a hand!

252
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,989
Oww! What are you doing?!
Stop it would you?!

253
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,057
You're pulling my
head off! Stop it!

254
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,459
Sorry, I'm afraid you're stuck.

255
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,560
[GAIMON]
Don't be stupid!

256
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,329
I've been stuck inside
this blasted treasure chest

257
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,230
for so many years now

258
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,733
that it's slowly become
a part of my body!

259
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,402
If you try to break it,
you'll break my body, too!

260
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,371
You're a strange little man.

261
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:29,041
[sighs] All right guys enough
about me, who are you?

262
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,810
You're not like any of
those other pirates

263
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,746
who've come around here,
that's for sure.

264
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,847
I'm Luffy!

265
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,849
I'm gonna be King
of the Pirates.

266
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,217
[gasps] You're what?!

267
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,852
I'm gonna get the One Piece.

268
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,054
And then I'm gonna
be King of the Pirates.

269
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,323
The One Piece?!
Don't tell me you idiots

270
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,059
are actually planning to
sail on the Grand Line!

271
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,495
[LUFFY] Yup! We got
a chart right here.

272
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,030
Don't be such a fool!

273
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,065
The Grand Line's a graveyard!

274
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,434
I once saw a group of pirates
who had managed to escape

275
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,070
from that horrible place,
and I'll never forget it.

276
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,273
It was an awful sight. They
were just the hollow shells

277
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,909
of the men that they used
to be. There's no telling

278
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,012
what horrors they witnessed
in that ghastly place.

279
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,882
Not one among them
even tried to speak.

280
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,749
[LUFFY]
Mm...

281
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,085
Now listen to me well
young pirates.

282
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,855
The rumors of the One Piece
spawn more rumors.

283
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,256
Who knows what's true?

284
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,225
It's been only 20 odd
years since the start

285
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,961
of the Great Pirate Era, and
the One Piece is already

286
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,397
a dream within a dream
beyond a legend!

287
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,602
So, which one of these
is the Grand Line?

288
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,805
I dunno. Figured you could
tell me, Mr. scrub brush guy.

289
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,974
Sorry, I never learned
how to read a sea chart.

290
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,542
I never did, either.

291
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,110
[BOTH laugh]

292
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,813
[NAMI]
Ignorance is bliss, isn't it?

293
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,983
Anyway, even if we do some how
make it to the Grand Line,

294
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,051
the best idea would be
to get as much treasure

295
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,887
as we can and then escape.

296
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,923
You go ahead and do that,
I'm gonna find the One Piece.

297
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,325
Where do you get all that
confidence of yours?

298
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,227
[LUFFY]
I'll get it! You'll see.

299
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,329
[NAMI]
Whatever you say.

300
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,400
You're me.

301
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,401
[LUFFY]
Hm?

302
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,004
You're exactly like me.
You even look like me.

303
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,405
We could be twins.

304
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,407
How can you say
he looks like you?

305
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,644
Young man. I understand about
the pursuit of your dreams!

306
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,147
When I was a younger man,
we used to feel the same way!

307
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,448
What do you mean we?

308
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,317
We were willing to put
our lives on the line

309
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,618
to search for treasure.

310
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,320
It was that single‐minded zeal

311
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,522
that changed the course
of my life forever.

312
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,757
Wait. Slow down.
What are you talking about?

313
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,427
It happened 20 years ago...
I was a much younger man then.

314
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,529
My fellow pirates and
I landed on this island

315
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,932
with a single purpose.

316
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,868
To find the treasure
that was said to rest here.

317
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,374
[CAPTAIN] Two‐hundred men have
searched for an entire month,

318
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,276
and nothing has been found!

319
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,446
The only treasure chest
we've uncovered is empty!

320
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,448
Pack up men! We're leaving.

321
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,317
[PIRATES grumble]

322
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,621
[PIRATE A] What are you looking
at Gaimon? It's time to go!

323
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,356
Right.

324
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,460
[GAIMON]
Did anyone look way up there?

325
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,497
I know that the captain stayed
down here the whole month.

326
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,900
[GAIMON grunting]

327
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,970
[GAIMON] I'd better go
ahead and double check.

328
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,211
[GAIMON]
I couldn't believe my own eyes!

329
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,247
Ha! I found it.
Guys, it's up here!

330
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,583
Hey! You guy‐‐

331
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,255
[GAIMON screaming]

332
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,363
[GAIMON] That's when I
got stuck in this chest!

333
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,597
[GAIMON gasps]

334
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:43,168
[GAIMON] When I came to, my crew
was already far out to sea.

335
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,674
Hold on. Yes.
I believe this means

336
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,243
that the entire fortune
belongs to me now!

337
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:56,348
I can't climb up like this! I
can't get out! I can't get out!

338
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,622
Hey! Come back!
Come back, please!

339
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,192
And after all this time, the
fortune I found but only saw

340
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,696
for an instant has never strayed
far from my lonely old mind.

341
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:14,133
Pirates have come here countless
times to search for my treasure.

342
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,536
But fortunately my friends
here, help me scare them away.

343
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,139
That's how I've kept my
treasure safe and sound

344
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,541
for the past twenty years.

345
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,577
It's my treasure!

346
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,280
No question.
It's yours all right!

347
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,115
You know, I think we
can help you out.

348
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,485
Gaimon, why don't we get the
treasure down for you?

349
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,054
[gasps] Wait, Do you mean it?

350
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,488
Yeah.

351
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,656
Nami.

352
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,492
Hey, aren't you a thief that
only steals from pirates?

353
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,494
[NAMI]
How rude!

354
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,797
I am a thief, but I
have a conscience!

355
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,165
[gasping]

356
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,857
It's here?

357
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,994
Yes, this is the place.
It's all up there.

358
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,501
The time has finally come!

359
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,269
It's a great day!

360
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,437
Get to it Straw Hat!

361
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,440
Sure thing! Gum‐Gum...

362
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,844
[laughing]

363
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,114
[LUFFY]
...Rocket!

364
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,382
[LUFFY laughs]

365
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,218
Awesome!

366
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,285
[LUFFY grunts]

367
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,292
Hey! The chests! You see?!

368
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,464
What the hell is he up to?

369
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,332
Hey!

370
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,900
[USOPP]
Hey, Luffy!

371
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,870
[NAMI]
What's going on?!

372
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,139
[LUFFY grunts]

373
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,508
I found 'em! Six
treasure chests!

374
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:06,411
Yes! Good work! [laughs]

375
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:10,249
Now it's mine! I got my
treasure! C'mon toss it down,

376
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,318
I wanna see it! Go ahead
and toss it down boy!

377
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,320
Let's have a look at it!

378
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,321
No way!

379
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,090
No way?!

380
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,393
I don't wanna.
Sucks for you!

381
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,596
What kind of crap is that,
Luffy? Give the man his gold!

382
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,065
You ass! That treasure
belongs to Gaimon

383
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,536
and you know it!
Toss it all down now!

384
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,176
Hey, I'm not joking
around, mister!

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,378
[GAIMON]
It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,512
It's all right.

387
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,446
[NAMI]
It's not all right.

388
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,882
Gaimon. You've been
guarding that treasure

389
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,219
with your heart and soul
for the past 20 years!

390
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,087
[GAIMON]
Straw Hat.

391
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,857
You're a great guy!

392
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,560
Uh. What do you
mean he's great?

393
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:59,264
I always had an inkling that...
this might be the case.

394
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,535
I tried not to think
about it. But still...

395
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,904
[cries] They're empty!

396
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,372
[gasps]

397
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,642
[LUFFY]
Yep. Every last one of 'em.

398
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,446
How sad. The treasure he
guarded for 20 long years

399
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,215
was just a bunch of empty boxes.

400
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,616
[GAIMON]
It happens all the time

401
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,119
with treasures that have
maps leading to them.

402
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,055
You set out on a
quest to find it,

403
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,224
but some one else
got to it first.

404
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,092
That's the kind of
risk you have to take

405
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,894
when you're a treasure
hunting pirate.

406
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,230
You can waste a whole
lifetime searching

407
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,998
and never once touch treasure.

408
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,567
Plenty of pirates lived
like that. Believe me!

409
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:40,439
[laughs] Try not to
be too upset, old man!

410
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,408
It's a good thing we came
along after twenty years!

411
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:47,479
Thirty years later, and
you might've been dead!

412
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,947
Oh, Straw Hat...

413
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,949
‐‐Luffy...
‐‐Is he...?

414
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,418
Since this treasure hunt's
a bust, you're gonna need

415
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,120
something else to
fill your time.

416
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,090
Why don't you join up with us
and search for the One Piece?

417
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,526
What? Really?
You're asking me?

418
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,630
Oh... I know how
I must look to you.

419
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:09,034
Other people wouldn't even
speak to me, but you were kind!

420
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:17,609
It's been so many years since
I've had a friend! [cries]

421
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,046
Thank you!

422
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,293
[LUFFY] Are you sure you wanna
stay on the island, Gaimon?

423
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,329
Yes, I'm sure. There's something
here far more valuable

424
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,464
than treasure that
I feel I must protect.

425
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,465
[NAMI]
Huh?

426
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,534
Worth more than gold?

427
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,637
For the past 20 years,

428
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:49,041
these guys have stood by my
side through thick and thin.

429
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,342
I can't leave 'em.

430
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,644
[laughing]

431
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,484
[GAIMON] Now that I know
there's no treasure here,

432
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,654
I somehow finally feel free.
Without that heavy burden

433
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,490
I can concentrate on the things
that really matter to me.

434
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,426
And besides,
after all these years

435
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,194
I've grown fond of
this little box.

436
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,497
Too bad! You're a neat guy.
Pretty cool for a scrub brush.

437
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,766
The weird creatures here
are your true friends.

438
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,669
[LUFFY] Yep! And he's
the weirdest of them all.

00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,371

Piece exists out there...
