is wash dishes and
peel some things!

made any food yet!

This isn't any normal lunch
that the curry was cooked for.

148
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,389
All of the ships' captains
have a tradition.

149
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,058
They get together once a week
and have curry for lunch

150
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,161
and this is the week that
my ship was supposed to host.

They're used to great curry.

up to what they're expecting?

The curry of the Marines
certainly is famous.

I hear the chefs from each ship

00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,471
are always competing
against each other

156
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,074
to see which one can
prepare the tastiest dish.

00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,576
Ooh! Sounds delicious.

158
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,811
With six months in the galley,

159
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,579
you should have more
confidence than that.

But if you don't
think you can do it,

161
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,084
just go back to your chef
and apologize again.

No way.

If I do then he'll
put me off the ship!

ship instead of on land?

00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,149
and I'd like to see it one day.

176
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,717
The older cooks all laugh it off

177
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,986
as a dream or a
myth or something,

178
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,055
but I still believe in it!

179
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,624
The All Blue is
out there somewhere!

180
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,059
Marine warships go everywhere,

181
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,129
so I have a good chance of
finding it by being on one.

182
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,632
So that's why... I can't afford
to be put off the ship.

183
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,635
Huh, that sounds familiar.

184
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,572
[NAMI]
Hmm...

185
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,076
I would really like us to get
out of here as soon as possible.

186
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,245
Yeah, if we're spotted,
they'll most likely fire at us,

187
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,048
and that would not
be a good situation.

188
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,984
[NAMI] However, we have to
do something about Tajio.

189
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,987
We should get him back
to his ship, right, Sanji?

190
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,091
Fine, I'll take the kid
back to his ship.

191
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,527
Hey, Luffy. Give us
a hand, will ya?

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,928
[LUFFY]
Hm?

193
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:21,167
Gum‐Gum Mooring Line!

194
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,269
All right, Sanji.
I've got the other ship.

195
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,072
This fog'll probably clear up
when the afternoon comes.

196
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,573
We really can't risk
hanging around

197
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,509
any longer than that, all right?

198
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,777
Yeah, that's enough.

199
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,779
[NAMI] How much are you
planning to help him?

200
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,047
[SANJI]
I don't know what you mean.

201
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,950
I'm only going to have a look
at the galley of a Marine ship.

202
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:38,951
Sanji!

203
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,186
[SANJI]
Yeah.

204
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,689
[LUFFY] All right. You guys make
sure to hold on tight to me.

205
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,059
[TAJIO,SANJI yell]

206
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,034
[SANJI] Luffy, why did you
decide to come along with us?

207
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,036
How'd you plan on
getting back without me?

208
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,205
Fine. You just wait here
and behave yourself, got it?

209
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,073
Yeah, I got it.

210
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,878
This is the galley here.

211
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,913
All right.

212
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,116
I might as well have a look,
as long as I'm here.

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,889
Heh, heh.

214
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,724
This is expensive stuff.

215
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,226
That's the Marines for you.

216
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,328
And everything seems to
be in really good shape.

217
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,096
[thud]

218
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,964
What was that?

219
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,733
[TAJIO]
It came from the ship's pantry.

220
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,737
Whoo, that startled me.

221
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,273
[gasps] Luffy, what do you
think you're doing in here?

222
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,641
Exploring.

223
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,243
I was on an adventure.

224
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,079
A chance like this doesn't
come along every day, after all.

225
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,582
[LUFFY laughs]

226
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,017
[LUFFY] So, I guess I'll go
explore somewhere else now!

227
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,252
You can do whatever you want,

228
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,288
but if the Marines find you,
I doubt they're gonna be nice.

229
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,523
Oh, and‐‐

230
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,092
whatever you've got stuffed
down your pants, leave it here.

231
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,328
‐‐[LUFFY grunts]
‐‐[SANJI] Apples, right?

232
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,667
This is the curry, or what's
left of it, at least.

233
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,775
I used to have your job
at a maritime restaurant.

234
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,676
[TAJIO]
Huh?

235
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,778
Yeah. The owner, Zeff,
never did seem to

236
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,281
want to teach me
anything either.

237
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,018
[SANJI]
Day in and day out,

238
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,788
all he ever let me do
was wash dishes.

239
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,792
[ZEFF]
Hey, you, brat.

240
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,861
Just working your hardest
isn't gonna be good enough

241
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,963
in this restaurant,
do you understand?

242
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,699
Just think about it all
for a little while.

243
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,068
Ask yourself why I would
let you into my kitchen

244
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,138
and then have you do
only chores for a year.

245
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,211
That's what Zeff told me

246
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,014
when I hated the kitchen
chores I'd been given.

247
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,182
Ah! Okay, now I get it.

248
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,150
Instead of teaching me,

249
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,687
chef wants me to absorb
his cooking skills.

250
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,090
Because cooking isn't
something that can be taught.

251
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,992
[TAJIO]
Hmm...

252
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:05,765
You know what?
I'm going to give it a try!

253
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,502
All right.

254
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,904
[TAJIO] Now I just have to
remember what it was Chef said!

255
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:12,738
[groans]

256
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,373
To make curry,
you basically combine

257
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,876
powder, broth,
vegetables, and seasonings,

258
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,780
and the curry powder needs
to be very delicately blended.

259
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,350
[SANJI]
From the aroma, it seems...

260
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,752
...they take ready‐made
curry powder and then add in

261
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,422
some freshly made garam masala.

262
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,025
[grunts, sneezes]

263
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,461
[TAJIO]
Hmm...

264
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,030
[CHEF] Only a lazy cook
will use an ingredient

265
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,366
that's sat around for days!

266
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,103
The longer ago it was made,
the less intense the flavor!

267
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,073
Ah! It's fresh garam masala!

268
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,218
[SANJI]
Well, it's a start, at least.

269
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,378
[LUFFY]
This is huge!

270
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,214
[MARINE A]
This fog is thick.

271
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,550
We won't be moving
for a little while.

272
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,986
[MARINE B] It'll probably
clear up around midday.

273
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,387
[MARINE B] Oh, yeah,
did you hear what happened

274
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,089
with the weekly luncheon?

275
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,257
[MARINE A]
Think so.

276
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,259
You talking about how that
probie cook has to make it?

277
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,560
[MARINE B]
I'm a little scared to find out

278
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,262
what kinda slop
he's gonna feed 'em!

279
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,264
[MARINE A]
Yeah, I'll say. Ha, ha, ha.

280
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,166
[sighs]

281
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,168
[TAJIO]
For the bullion, at least,

282
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,239
I should be able to use the
stuff that's already been made.

283
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,342
Now I'll prepare
the other ingredients.

284
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,111
For the first step,
I'm going to need to

285
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,913
cut up and brown this beef.

286
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,281
Hm?

287
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,124
[SANJI]
In some beef curries,

288
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,493
the beef flavor stays
locked within the meat

289
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,262
and is not allowed
to intrude upon

290
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,631
the flavor of the curry itself.

291
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,100
From the taste of
this recipe, however,

292
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,036
I can tell that the beef
is used to flavor the curry.

293
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,006
So, the meat's juices should be
dissolved in the broth.

294
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,608
In which case, the kid's
already messing things up

295
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,278
and he just got started.

296
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,680
[SANJI clears throat]

297
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,348
Something wrong?

298
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,553
Nah, kid.

299
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,554
I was just thinking that

300
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,722
cooking isn't something
you should rush through.

301
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,824
[gasps]

302
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,660
[CHEF] Everything in cooking
depends on preparation.

303
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,395
That's the most important part.

304
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,463
It's vital to take your time.

305
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,465
Always keep that in mind.

306
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,167
[TAJIO gasps]

307
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,309
[TAJIO]
Add garlic.

308
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,045
[TAJIO]
Ginger.

309
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,548
[TAJIO]
Turmeric, too.

310
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,084
Then you put in
some yogurt as well.

311
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,356
[TAJIO] That takes care
of the preparations.

312
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,392
Next, I need to start
sautéing the onion.

313
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,062
[SANJI]
Hm?

314
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,100
Uh...

315
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,038
[gasps]

316
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,209
[grunts]

317
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,544
As a chef, you have to know
that it's not appropriate

318
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,747
to smoke where food
is being prepared!

319
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,382
Earlier I said that
you were way too good

320
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,085
to be a cook on a pirate ship,
but now I take it back!

321
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,787
Well would you look at that.

322
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,490
It seems that I've
singed my hair.

323
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,059
[TAJIO grunts]

324
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,397
[door closes]

325
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,631
[gasps]

326
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,101
[CHEF] Now, begin by sautéing
the onions over a strong flame.

327
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,804
But keep them moving,
so they don't get scorched.

328
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,440
Once the onions are soft,
you lower the flame.

329
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,309
Stir slow and gentle,

330
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,843
and keep simmering them

331
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,780
over low heat until they're
a nice golden brown.

332
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,648
Got that, men?

333
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,749
That's what he meant.

334
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:54,186
Sanji was just warning me
about the heat level.

335
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,601
[LUFFY grunts]

336
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,870
[LUFFY]
Wow! This is really high.

337
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,342
The view sure is a whole lot
different from way up here.

338
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,843
‐‐[MARINE C] Huh?
‐‐[LUFFY] Huh?

339
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,611
‐‐[MARINE C] Hey, who are you?
‐‐[LUFFY gasps]

340
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,547
It looks like they've seen me!

341
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,681
[MARINE C]
Hold it!

342
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,450
[LUFFY]
Uh‐oh, where am I goin'?

343
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,618
[LUFFY grunts]

344
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,788
[TAJIO]
Get the pork fat melted.

345
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,225
[TAJIO]
Then add in the flour.

346
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,195
[TAJIO]
Gently though.

347
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,830
No scorching.

348
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,870
[TAJIO]
Put the curry powder in...

349
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:48,474
...and add fresh garam masala
to enhance the flavor.

350
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,583
[TAJIO] Now, finally,
we put the ingredients together.

351
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,687
[TAJIO]
Add in the bullion...

352
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,857
[TAJIO]
...tomatoes...

353
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,264
Add the sautéed onions...

354
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,204
[TAJIO]
...and then the marinated beef.

355
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,680
[TAJIO gulps]

356
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,556
[TAJIO gasps]

357
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,460
[TAJIO gasping]

358
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,595
It's wrong.

359
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,965
[TAJIO]
It's so weak!

360
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,967
[whimpers]

361
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:49,968
I was right.

362
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,971
I couldn't do it after all.

363
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,706
[SANJI]
Hmm.

364
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,311
[gasps]

365
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,713
[TAJIO]
Subtle flavor.

366
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,015
Sanji!

367
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,391
Nice apple.

368
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,461
It sure is sweet.

369
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,263
[TAJIO]
Uh, Sanji?

370
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,565
[SANJI]
Hm?

371
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,933
[TAJIO]
Thank you so much!

372
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,068
What do you mean?

373
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,037
I haven't done anything
that requires thanks.

374
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,905
I was just looking
around, that's all.

375
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,574
Sanji, you said that
you were just stopping by

376
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,708
to look at a Marine galley,

377
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,377
but you were really trying
to teach me about cooking.

378
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,379
[SANJI] I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

379
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,314
[MARINE C]
Over there!

380
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,216
‐‐[SANJI] Huh?
‐‐He ran in that direction!

381
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,219
[LUFFY]
Sanji! Let's get goin'!

382
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,387
Luffy, you idiot.

383
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,323
[MARINE D]
Stop right there!

384
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,494
[LUFFY]
Gum‐Gum Mooring Line!

385
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,131
All right! I got it!

386
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,234
[SANJI]
Tajio.

387
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,401
[TAJIO]
Huh?

388
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,437
[SANJI]
I think it's out there, too‐‐

389
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,239
the great All Blue!

390
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,306
[gasps]

391
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,608
Now, Sanji. Grab on!

392
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,109
[SANJI]
Right.

393
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,178
[LUFFY grunts]

394
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,313
[SANJI yells]

395
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,352
[TAJIO giggles]

396
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,586
Hey, Tajio,

397
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,622
there was a suspicious looking
man up here a second ago.

398
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,923
Did you see where he went?

399
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,591
Hm? I didn't see anything.

400
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,693
Maybe the fog was playing
tricks on your eyes.

401
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,661
[groans] Keep looking!

402
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,297
He has to be hiding
on the ship somewhere!

403
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,932
[MARINE D]
Find him!

404
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,772
[SANJI]
Damn you.

405
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,642
You did this on
purpose, didn't you?

406
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,177
[LUFFY]
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,612
[SANJI] Really? 'Cause
you don't look very sorry.

408
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,147
[LUFFY]
That's why I'm sorry.

409
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,349
[SANJI]
I'm going to fillet you!

410
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,618
Luffy, what's the matter?

411
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,522
[yells] Did you seriously damage
the Going Merry again, Luffy?!

412
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,491
Oh, yeah, about that,
I'm really sorry.

413
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,294
The Marines saw me so we kinda
had to hurry up and get back.

414
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,395
[chuckles]

415
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,530
[NAMI]
What?! The Marines saw you?

416
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,998
How could you let that happen?

417
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,999
[USOPP]
We got this ship from Kaya,

418
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,968
so it's really important
that we take care of it.

419
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,970
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

420
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,305
[NAMI] We can't just
stand around like this.

421
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,407
Usopp, Sanji, we're
leaving immediately.

422
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,009
[SANJI]
Yes, Nami, my love!

423
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,078
But I can't really
move at the moment.

424
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,147
[ROBIN chuckles]

425
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,694
[grunts] Serve the curry.

426
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,262
Yes, sir!

427
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,546
And now, I hope that
you enjoy your meal.

428
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,261
[CAPTAIN A] My goodness,
this is very good indeed.

429
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,295
[CAPTAIN B]
Yes, not too thick,

430
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,397
and the spices are
blended together perfectly.

431
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,531
[CAPTAIN C]
The meat is so tender

432
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,267
it almost melts in your mouth.

433
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,202
[CAPTAIN D]
Another bowl, right away.

434
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,203
[CHEF]
Tajio.

435
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,537
Yes, sir, Chef, sir?

436
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,539
Make certain that you
get everything cleaned up

437
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,408
in the kitchen.

438
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,543
Oh, yes. Yes, sir!

439
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,657
[TAJIO]
Sanji...

440
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,461
[SANJI]
I think it's out there, too‐‐

441
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,597
the great All Blue!

442
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,278
[TAJIO]
I'm going to work really hard.

443
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,481
And someday, I'll be as
good a cook as you, Sanji.

444
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,250
I promise!

[USOPP] Wow! Fireworks
are great, aren't they?

460
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,868
They're just so pretty!

461
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,836
I'd like to set
some off sometime.

462
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,838
What? You mean you'll let me?

463
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,574
I can even set off
that huge one over there?

Now that I think
about it, though,

465
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,245
isn't that one a little too big?
