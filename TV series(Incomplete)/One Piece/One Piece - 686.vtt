[cackles]

00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:34.088
My darkness will swallow the
world, just you wait and see!

00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.992
You think I'll lose to you?

00:01:36.025 --> 00:01:38.096
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:42.672
Roger's treasure belongs to me!

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.582
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:40.487
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.732
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.303
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.543
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.446
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.952
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.791
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:03.266
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.803
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:08.577
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:16.192
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.096
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.133
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.505
Their current objective
is to destroy a man-made

00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:24.943
Devil Fruit Factory in
the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:27.014

[screams]

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.558
[NARRATOR]
Usopp freed citizens

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:34.461
who had been
transformed into toys,

00:03:34.495 --> 00:03:36.767
prompting Doflamingo to
trap the entire kingdom

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.405
inside a barrier known
as the "Birdcage."

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:43.046
[DOFLAMINGO] Now, it's time
to watch the final act unfold.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.551
[gasps] The Birdcage.

00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:53.701
The stars will be worth
100 million berries each.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:54.970
[NARRATOR]
He then placed bounties

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.074
on Luffy and his allies.

00:03:57.107 --> 00:03:58.477
[yells]

00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.947
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE I]
Wait, Hajrudin! You do realize

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.719
if you kill Straw Hat,
you'll get good chunk of money?

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:04.255
That is but a pittance!

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:07.127
My gratitude is beyond
monetary value.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.033
I owe my savoir,
God Usopp, the world!

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.871
My pride cannot
truly return to me

00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:15.410
until I adequately
reciprocate his benevolence!

00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:17.816
Go home!
I'll finish off Doflamingo!

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.252
--[IDEO] No, I will!
--[GILLY] No, I will!

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:20.353
No me!

00:04:20.386 --> 00:04:23.794
[ALL yelling]

00:04:23.827 --> 00:04:29.806
I said go away! I already
called dibs on Mingo!

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.514
[JEET] We have no place
to run! We're doomed!

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.718
[ABDULLAH]
It was nice knowing you!

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:39.793
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:04:39.826 --> 00:04:44.034
...Grizzly Magnum!

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.445
Uh, there's a guy inside
the big rock guy?

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.949
This is the first
time we're actually

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:52.451
seeing him in the flesh.

00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:53.921
[LUFFY]
Catch ya later!

00:04:55.558 --> 00:04:57.494
[ZORO]
Okay! I got this!

00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:59.231
You'll have to fight me first.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:03.641
He has better things to do than
tangle with a pebble like you.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:08.650
Deal with it, Soprano Man.
I'm all that you've got.

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:16.332
[LUFFY] "A Shocking Confession!
Law's Soulful Vow!"

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:30.961
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:37.307
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Lord Pica isn't moving anymore!

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:40.280
Is it okay for him to
lose his head like that?

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:42.117
Who did that to him?

00:05:42.985 --> 00:05:46.192
[DAGAMA] Huh? That monster
stopped dead in its tracks.

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:48.263
Is he dead?

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.464
[FARUL neighs]

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:52.103
Doubt it. That's
far too convenient.

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.610
Regardless, it seems like
those annoying punches of his

00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:56.513
have ceased for the moment.

00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:58.349
So let's strike while we can!

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:00.554
Doflamingo shall die by my hand!

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:01.422
[IDEO]
No, mine!

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.092
[SAI]
No, mine!

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:05.798
[ALL yelling]

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:08.236
Those stubborn bastards don't
know when to give up, do they?

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:09.405
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE C]
Fire! Don't let them

00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:10.941
get to the palace!

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.804
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES gasp]

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:31.048
[HAJRUDIN]
Why don't you bring out someone

00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:33.452
worth fighting next time?

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.770
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE D groans]
We gave it our best.

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:45.410
But we can't stop the fighters
from the coliseum.

00:06:45.444 --> 00:06:48.082
Those little rats are really
fired up, aren't they?

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:50.019
[GLADIUS] They actually
think they have a chance

00:06:50.053 --> 00:06:51.422
against the Young Master?

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:53.092
They're throw-een
their lives away.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:56.265
Indeed so! Once Fujitora
arrives at the palace

00:06:56.299 --> 00:07:01.543
with his Marines, they'll be
ground up, with a capital G!

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:07.454
Bastille's unit should
be joining up with us

00:07:07.487 --> 00:07:08.958
any minute now.

00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:12.164
Half of our Navy forces are
already in front of the palace.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.070
I had a feeling that
was Straw Hat's group.

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.575
They did stop Lord Pica.

00:07:17.608 --> 00:07:20.213
We have four different enemies--
or groups of enemies--

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:21.783
approaching the
palace right now.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.455
First, there's the competitors
from the coliseum,

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.593
all strong fighters
from the New World.

00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:29.031
Second, there's Kyros,
former army commander,

00:07:29.064 --> 00:07:33.039
and quite possibly the strongest
gladiator who's ever lived.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.686
I don't want to do this, Kyros,
just give yourself up!

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.723
If we don't catch you,
we're all dead!

00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:43.928
Too many of us
have been hurt already!

00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:45.598
You and the other
criminals should quit,

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:47.768
for the good of Dressrosa!

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:50.508
[BABY 5] Next, there's
the second in command

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:53.814
of the Straw Hats,
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

00:08:01.897 --> 00:08:06.004
[BABY 5] Lastly, there's Straw
Hat Luffy and that traitor, Law!

00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:08.577
[LUFFY]
Woohoo!

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.716
[LUFFY laughing]
Yeah!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.455
You got this, Moocy!
Let's keep it up!

00:08:14.488 --> 00:08:17.160
[JEET]
Yeah, go Moocy!

00:08:17.193 --> 00:08:18.029
[ABDULLAH]
Nice work!

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.198
Moocy is my ride!

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.770
If you want one, then get off
and find your own!

00:08:21.803 --> 00:08:25.276
[ABDULLAH, JEET] You're such a
kidder! We love you, Straw Hat!

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:32.625
[BABY 5]
I don't see Señor anywhere.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.829
He was here a second ago,
but last I heard,

00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:37.935
he's off search-een for that
pervert from the Straw Hats.

00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:39.705
What pervert?

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:52.264
[FRANKY] This must be
the place! Pervert convert!

Wow! Wow, ow! Ow!

00:08:57.742 --> 00:08:58.911
I hates me some gates

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:02.384
and I'm downright
disrespectful to doors!

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.858
Get a load of my Radical Bea--

00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:08.063
[SEÑOR] For the record,
that crappy beam of yours

00:09:08.096 --> 00:09:10.702
wouldn't even put
a dent in the factory.

00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:13.039
I came here for one reason.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:14.876
To settle our score.

00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:21.456
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:23.694
Haven't I fought you enough?

00:09:23.728 --> 00:09:27.000
A man's battle never ends.
You got that, boy?

00:09:27.034 --> 00:09:29.404
[WOMEN] Wow! That was
an awesome burn, Señor!

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:30.708
[FRANKY]
Shut up!

00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:32.144
I'm begging you, Kyros.

00:09:32.177 --> 00:09:35.082
Walk out from behind there
and surrender yourself!

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.789
If you don't do that,
then we'll come and get you!

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.759
We aren't doing this for money!

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.397
We don't turn you in,
then everyone's gonna die!

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:43.900
[TOWNSMAN B]
There's no other choice!

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.069
[TOWNSMAN C]
We just wanna bring an end

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:47.675
to this nightmare
as soon as possible!

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.048
[TOWNSMAN A gasps]

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:05.578
[KYROS] I can't blame you for
wanting to end this quickly.

00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.815
And I certainly don't disagree.

00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:11.790
But if that's the case, then I
need to move even faster.

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:15.731
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:10:17.735 --> 00:10:20.006
[TOWNSMAN D]
Don't let him get away!

00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:22.845
I won't lose.

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:26.118
But there is something
that I must do first.

I don't want anyone
else kicking your ass.

You and me!

[LUFFY] Hm? What're you
looking at back there?

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.955
Just thinking about your friend.

00:11:00.988 --> 00:11:03.092
I can't believe what he did.

00:11:03.126 --> 00:11:06.800
Staying behind to fight
that monster all by himself.

00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:10.039
[ABDULLAH, JEET crying]
He's a man among men!

Are you guys worried about Zoro?

He won't lose to a rock.

Trust me on this one.

I am gonna pulverize you!

Huh? Tsk. Could you just
tone it down a little bit?

rattles in my head.

win, then it'll happen for sure.

No matter what it takes!

[LAW]
Hey, Straw Hat.

[LUFFY]
Huh?

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.425
[LAW]
I realize we have no choice

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.231
but to kill Doflamingo now.

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:31.769
That's fine. I'm ready.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:35.510
I know that's not the plan
I suggested before.

00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:39.284
I thought we could get away
with a less-direct approach.

00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:41.723
But to be perfectly
honest with you,

00:12:41.757 --> 00:12:44.963
I want to make him suffer
with my own hands.

00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:47.835
I won't let him defeat me again.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:11.983
[moos]

00:13:25.745 --> 00:13:30.921
[LAW] Thirteen years ago, there
was a person I cared for deeply,

00:13:30.955 --> 00:13:33.594
and Doflamingo killed him.

00:13:33.627 --> 00:13:35.129
[gasps]

00:13:55.705 --> 00:13:57.908
[LAW]
His name was Corazon.

00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:00.547
[LAW]
He was a former top executive

00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:02.450
in the Don Quixote Family.

00:14:02.483 --> 00:14:05.924
[LUFFY gasps]
Mingo killed his own friend?

00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.200
Corazon was the man
who saved my life.

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:13.138
But to Doflamingo,
he was more than just

00:14:13.172 --> 00:14:16.178
a member of the
Don Quixote Family.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.998
He was his younger brother.

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:27.868
[LUFFY gasps]

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:06.946
[BARTOLOMEO humming]
Mister Luffy?

00:15:09.184 --> 00:15:12.558
Where are you hiding,
Mister Luffy?

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:18.937
[BARTOLOMEO] Come on,
there's no need to be shy!

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:24.114
What's the deal?

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.519
Does this mean
Mister Luffy's not here?

00:15:26.552 --> 00:15:27.487
Of course not.

00:15:27.522 --> 00:15:29.258
[BARTOLOMEO]
Why didn't anyone tell me?

00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:31.195
Luffy never stays
anywhere for more than

00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:32.731
five minutes at a time.

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:36.004
Ahh! Now that's freedom! Whoo!

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:39.177
The King of the Pirates
knows how to roll, huh?

00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:52.771
What's that big monster?
Come take a look.

00:15:52.804 --> 00:15:54.107
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:06.198
What is the royal palace
doing way up there?

00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:33.185
I got the key.

00:16:33.218 --> 00:16:36.191
[REBECCA gasps]
Viola!

00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:42.403
[DWARVES cheering]

00:16:51.957 --> 00:16:53.358
[DOLDO]
Viola.

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.864
[VIOLET gasps]
Father. Did you see?

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:58.268
I have the key
to Law's handcuffs.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.977
I was able to find it,
thanks to my Clairvoyance.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.513
Now, to get it to Straw Hat.

00:17:03.546 --> 00:17:08.489
[DOLDO] Hm? Viola, wait.
Why place your faith in them?

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:09.525
They're criminals.

00:17:09.558 --> 00:17:12.464
That's fine. Our kingdom
must be broken down

00:17:12.497 --> 00:17:15.571
and its lies exposed.
They'll do that.

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:16.539
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:17:16.573 --> 00:17:19.545
I trust them to end
this false peace.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.517
So I'm betting everything
on the Straw Hats.

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:32.872
The World Government
has proven untrustworthy.

00:17:32.905 --> 00:17:34.441
They gave a title to Doflamingo,

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:37.213
who ruled this
kingdom with cruelty.

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:41.121
Who caused our family
so much pain and suffering.

00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.473
After all these years,
I don't want the Navy's help!

00:17:50.507 --> 00:17:53.145
They have failed
our people enough!

00:17:56.318 --> 00:17:58.623
[VIOLET] They're blind to
the meaning of justice

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:02.296
and deaf to the voices of
those they've victimized.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:05.637
[VIOLET]
They don't understand our rage.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:10.113
[VIOLET] People in authority
have the privilege

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:12.784
of only hearing
what they want to hear.

00:18:16.726 --> 00:18:17.728
But Straw Hat?

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.899
He acts on the goodness
inside his heart.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.506
Even though he's a pirate,
he hasn't lost his humanity!

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.380
I'll give Doflamingo

00:18:27.413 --> 00:18:29.685
the biggest beating
of his life for you!

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:33.125
Make sure you guys all
live to see it, okay?

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:36.264
Did you even think of
the kingdom?

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:39.538
If we chicken out now,
what'll happen to it?

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:54.502
[LEO] This might change
your mind, King Riku.

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:57.306
I want you to look at this man.

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:02.416
The one worth five stars?

00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:05.891
That's right!

00:19:05.924 --> 00:19:09.699
Usoland. AKA, God Usopp.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:12.905
He risked his life and faced off
with Trebol and Sugar.

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:16.011
He freed the people who
had been enslaved as toys

00:19:16.044 --> 00:19:18.516
and brought everyone's
memories back!

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:21.856
He is the hero of our people!

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:26.766
[DWARVES] Usoland, go!
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.243
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!
Usoland, go!

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:35.818
We were all moved by
the bravery he showed.

00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:42.463
So, so, so much that even now
we can't stop crying!

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:45.269
He's a superhero,
I'm telling you!

00:19:45.302 --> 00:19:50.179
[DWARVES] Usoland, go!
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:51.916
Usoland, go!

00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:56.424
[LEO] And Luffyland is his
captain, so he's super, too!

00:19:57.193 --> 00:19:58.597
Please believe me.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.602
The Usolanders, or rather,
the Straw Hats,

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:05.410
are the greatest hope
that Dressrosa's got!

00:20:05.443 --> 00:20:06.813
Even though they're pirates,

00:20:06.846 --> 00:20:10.653
I'll trust them and cheer
them on till the very end!

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:15.931
Now they see the truth!

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:19.371
The whole kingdom will know how
great the Straw Hat Pirates are!

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:21.676
I'm so lucky to be here
for this moment!

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:24.916
[DWARVES]
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!

00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:31.428
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!
Usoland, go! Usoland, go!

00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:35.904
Hey, Viola. Can I deliver
the key to Lucy for you?

00:20:35.937 --> 00:20:36.973
I don't know!

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:38.876
I can't just
stand here and wait.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.046
Let me go!

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:41.181
Rebecca.

00:20:41.215 --> 00:20:42.951
Okey dokey, sounds great!

00:20:42.985 --> 00:20:44.421
Let's go see Mister Luffy!

00:20:44.454 --> 00:20:46.358
Don't worry, I'll keep
you nice and safe!

00:20:46.391 --> 00:20:47.761
Just count on me!

00:20:47.794 --> 00:20:49.064
That's no good!

00:20:49.097 --> 00:20:52.370
Or did you forget that you're
on Doflamingo's wanted list?

00:20:52.404 --> 00:20:54.007
People will hunt you down!

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.510
I'll be fine!

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:07.901
All right, then. Be careful.

00:21:11.374 --> 00:21:12.844
[LEO]
Let's fly, Cub!

00:21:12.878 --> 00:21:14.046
[CUB]
Right!

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:16.852
[LEO]
Listen up!

00:21:21.963 --> 00:21:23.164
Are you going, too?

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.937
We'll lead the way!
On the rooftops!

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.714
Cub and I know how to
handle this! Don't worry!

00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:31.982
On the rooftops?

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.820
That's right! Hey, Inhel.

00:21:33.853 --> 00:21:36.091
Can I leave the factory
in your hands?

00:21:36.124 --> 00:21:37.326
No problem!

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:39.498
I already checked in
with the Scouting Unit.

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:41.335
They said Fraland
is fighting Señor Pink

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.805
at the gate as we speak.

00:21:42.838 --> 00:21:45.643
We'll rush over and
help him any way we can!

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:47.614
We'll take back
Princess Mansherry.

00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:50.152
and all our friends, too!

00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:52.023
[LEO]
Until next time, then!

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:53.058
All right, people!

00:21:53.092 --> 00:21:55.597
We've sat around
for long enough!

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.500
We'll complete our missions
and meet back here

00:21:57.534 --> 00:21:59.203
on the King's Plateau!

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:00.840
Are you guys ready?

00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:03.646
[DWARVES]
Yeah!

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:07.754
[DOLDO]
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:22:07.788 --> 00:22:11.261
He really does seem to
have a mysterious power.

00:22:11.294 --> 00:22:13.600
Even in this
desperate situation.

00:22:13.633 --> 00:22:15.937
Even when he's not here with us.

00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:19.678
The mere mention of his name
fills people with hope.

00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:26.759
[DOLDO]
Pirates, huh?

00:22:30.132 --> 00:22:31.368
[JEET]
This is it, Straw Hat!

00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:32.771
We're about to reach the bottom!

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:35.108
[ABDULLAH] They've got a
welcoming party waiting for us!

00:22:35.142 --> 00:22:36.344
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE E]
What's that?

00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:37.480
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE F]
Something's coming!

00:22:37.514 --> 00:22:39.117
Yeah, we're the
first ones to make it!

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.854
We get dibs on beating up Mingo!

00:22:40.887 --> 00:22:42.056
[BULL moos]

00:22:42.089 --> 00:22:44.394
It's all thanks to you, Moocy!

00:22:44.427 --> 00:22:46.699
[BULL moos]

00:22:47.768 --> 00:22:49.137
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE G]
Crap! It's Straw Hat!

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.105
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE H]
Shoot! Shoot!

00:22:50.139 --> 00:22:53.278
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:56.017
...Fire Salute!

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.194
Okay! Now pick up the pace!

00:23:01.227 --> 00:23:02.363
Are you ready?

00:23:02.396 --> 00:23:04.033
[BULL moos]

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.872
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

00:23:14.253 --> 00:23:16.792
[NARRATOR] Luffy continues
his advance on the palace,

00:23:16.825 --> 00:23:19.431
but is soon threatened by
a massive force of Marines,

00:23:19.464 --> 00:23:20.700
lead by Fujitora.

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.203
As the enemy begins to close in,

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:25.544
one man stands in their way,
issuing a fiery challenge.

00:23:25.577 --> 00:23:26.912
Now, the strongest in the Navy

00:23:26.946 --> 00:23:30.252
and the strongest in the
Revolutionary Army face off!

00:23:30.286 --> 00:23:32.023
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:33.058
"A Big Collision!

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:36.464
Chief of Staff
Sabo vs. Admiral Fujitora!"

00:23:36.497 --> 00:23:39.504
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
