00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:36.068
I need you to replicate this!

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:40.106
It's SMILE! But how?
Where'd you get it?

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.309
Let's just say I have
friends in low places.

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.145
If you can provide me
with an unlimited supply

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.447
of manmade
Zoan-type Devil Fruit,

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:52.785
I'll use it to forcibly
turn humans into animals!

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:55.688
Once I do that, there won't
be a single one of you

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:58.691
detestable humans left
in the entire world!

00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:00.826
How do you expect
a backwards civilization

like that to work?

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.297
[BREED]
Hadn't you guessed?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.433
I'm going to make
every living creature

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:11.270
eat that Zoan-type fruit
and transform into animals.

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:13.272
And then, using the
powers I received

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.440
from the Pet-Pet Fruit,

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:17.109
I'll be able to manipulate
them all at will!

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.611
I can rule over everything

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:21.013
with all of animal-kind
as my pets!

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.316
That's the dream kingdom you're
going to help me build!

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.788
[BREED cackles]

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:30.389

Go ahead and try.

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.357
Huh?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.093
But I don't take
orders from anybody.

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.963
What? Were you not listening?

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.733
I have the power to make
all living things obey me!

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:43.569
Maybe so, but I still won't!

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:46.238
You arrogant fool!

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.610
The only thing you pitiful
humans are good for

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:55.347
is obeying my every command.
Do I make myself clear?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.950
Don't you dare test me!

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.453
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm a pirate!

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:06.625
So I play by my own rules!
‘Cause a pirate should be free!

Of all the miserable humans,
you stubborn dreamers

are the worst kind!

[BREED] You know, I was going to
enslave you and spare your life.

It's showtime!

You're about to
witness the terror

of the Pet-Pet Fruit's power!

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.747
Now, let's get started.

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.283
Trafalgar!

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:07.319

What's the purpose
behind this nonsense?

Now, fight to the death!
And no powers, either.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.111
You are going to beat
each other to death
