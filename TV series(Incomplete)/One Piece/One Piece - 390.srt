1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,158
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,760
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:45,331
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,837
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,606
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,243
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,946
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,483
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,586
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:10,156
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,259
[NARRATOR] While on their
journey to Fishman Island,

48
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,229
The Straw Hat crew was ambushed
by the Flying Fish Riders

49
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,799
and their leader, Duval,
resulting in a desperate battle.

50
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:25,371
Straw Hats,
I'm gonna murder you!

51
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,473
[NARRATOR] Blaming Sanji
for his misfortunes,

52
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:32,378
Duval swore to destroy the Straw
Hats, even if it killed him.

53
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,748
[SANJI]
Oeil! Nez! Joue!

54
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,619
Bouche! Dents! Menton!

55
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,721
Parage Shot!

56
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,423
Now eat this.

57
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,335
[LUFFY] Disembarking with
Sights Set on Fishman Island!

58
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,737
The Sabaody Archipelago!

59
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,918
Hey, Head! Where are you?

60
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,486
Talk to us!

61
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,258
[FISH RIDER 386A]
There he is!

62
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,827
--Are you okay, Head? Are you?
--Are you okay, Head? Are you?

63
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,931
Oh, man. This is awful.

64
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,898
He really messed him up.

65
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,334
[FISH RIDER 387A] Head?
Are you still alive?

66
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,271
Look, he's moving!

67
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,542
Damn it.

68
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,046
[DUVAL]
It's not fair.

69
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,583
Ah finally track down Black Leg
and look at what he does to me.

70
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:48,988
[DUVAL]
What?

71
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,657
I know we got our asses kicked,

72
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,892
but you don't need
to look that surprised.

73
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:53,793
But Head,

74
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,828
this ass-kicking's
a little different.

75
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,566
[DUVAL]
What...

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,069
M-My face...

77
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:07,774
What... What the hell
happened to my face?!

78
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,685
[LUFFY]
So good!

79
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,124
[CAMIE]
Yep!

80
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,225
Hatchin's octopus fritters
are the best in the world!

81
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,594
[LUFFY] I can't stop eating
and you can't make me!

82
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,396
This stuff is amazing!

83
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,837
[screaming]

84
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,708
They're great! Wow!

85
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,009
That flavor.

86
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,383
It's a brilliant idea turnin'
your ship into a food stall.

87
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,721
This is the first time
I've had the pleasure

88
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,356
of eating octopus fritters.

89
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,657
They really are delectable.

90
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,392
My stomach is about to burst,

91
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,994
or it would, if I had
one in the first place.

92
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,096
Nyuu!

93
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,531
You can eat as much as
you want. It's on the house!

94
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,899
It's the very least we can do

95
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,868
to show a little
gratitude for saving us.

96
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,103
These have rice cakes in 'em,

97
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,771
and these were
made with soup stock.

98
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,773
Be careful now,
they're really hot.

99
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,878
So, Nami,
what do you think?

100
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,913
Are... they good?

101
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,957
Um... Is it...

102
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,992
Uh, does it taste okay?

103
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,864
Listen. Don't think
I'm going to forgive you

104
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,699
'cause of something
silly like this.

105
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,434
No! No, of course not!

106
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,668
That's not what I meant!

107
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,471
I just wanted to know if ya
think it tastes good, honestly!

108
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,073
That's all, I swear!

109
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,017
So, uh...

110
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,822
It's really delicious!

111
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,792
Nyuuuuu!

112
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,161
You think so?
Do you mean that?

113
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,595
That's such a relief!

114
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,731
I'm so happy you like it!

115
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,900
[HACHI]
Now go ahead and eat up!

116
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,867
Don't hold back!

117
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,636
There's plenty more
where that came from!

118
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,970
[LUFFY]
Yeah! Keep it comin'!

119
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,839
I'm nowhere near full!

120
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,624
[DUVAL]
Heyyyyy!

121
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,960
Hey, you guys!

122
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,829
[DUVAL]
Heyyyy, you guys!

123
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,096
Young masterrrrr!

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,031
[ZORO]
Who's that?

125
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,033
It's those guys.

126
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,235
[DUVAL]
Wait, don't go!

127
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,872
You can't leave before
I get to say thank you!

128
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,774
Who is this clown, anyway?

129
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,741
I'm eating here.

130
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,177
[laughing]

131
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,011
Handsome!

132
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:03,850
Well, obviously,
but it's me, Duval!

133
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,885
[DUVAL laughing]

134
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,187
[LUFFY]
Wait...

135
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,956
Didn't his face look different?

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,093
I rearranged his bone structure.

137
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,963
Now the creep's got nothin'
to gripe and moan about.

138
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,098
[DUVAL]
Why, young master Black Leg!

139
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,567
I was surprised after
you kicked my face,

140
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,570
but I can't deny
the results are amazing!

141
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,571
Look!

142
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,106
Look how ravishing and
handsome you've made me!

143
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,708
I'm a different person!

144
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,711
Wow! The ladies are
gonna go nuts over me.

145
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,947
I must say,
life's starting to look rosy.

146
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,048
I love it!

147
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,184
[laughing]

148
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,887
[DUVAL] All I want to do now
is head back to the countryside

149
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,054
and take it easy.

150
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,557
But there's no way I could
leave without thanking you.

151
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,926
I'd be paralyzed
with guilt if I did.

152
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,095
It's your first time
in this part of the sea,

153
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,531
so if there's anything
we can do to help you out,

154
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,699
do not hesitate to call on us.

155
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,905
[SANJI] Don't wink
until your face is settled.

156
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,573
Well as long as you're happy,

157
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,008
that's more than enough.

158
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,844
If you really wanna pay me back,
don't bother us anymore.

159
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,647
So handsome. I'm beautiful.

160
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,148
Are you even listening to me?

161
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,117
[DUVAL]
I belong atop a white stallion.

162
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,318
[SANJI]
Hey! Listen!

163
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,052
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Head!

164
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:13,719
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Hey, Head!

165
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,021
Listen to the guy, will ya?

166
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,822
[DUVAL]
Did he say...

167
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,224
...I'm handsome?

168
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,693
[SANJI] I didn't say
anything remotely like that!

169
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,763
You want me to turn your face
back into the wanted poster?

170
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,773
[snaps]

171
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,175
Blowing me a kiss
is a bit forward,

172
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,677
but nonetheless...

173
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,811
I accept.

174
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:39,845
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Woo-hoo!

175
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,880
[NAMI]
I didn't blow you a kiss!

176
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,649
I was just wiping
all this sauce off my lips!

177
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,353
[NAMI] You're so
overconfident you're delusional!

178
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,589
[DUVAL]
Mirror, mirror, in my hand,

179
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,991
I'm the handsomest in the land.

180
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,225
[FISH RIDERS]
You didn't give it a choice!

181
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,295
[DUVAL laughing]

182
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,330
You know,
it doesn't really matter

183
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,199
how handsome you are
if you're still an idiot.

184
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,270
Oh! You're jealous!

185
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,271
No, I'm not!

186
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,772
Give it up, Usopp!

187
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,975
You can't talk him
out of being crazy.

188
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,743
[DUVAL]
Well, young master and friends--

189
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,912
Here's my
transponder snail number.

190
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,614
Call me any time.

191
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,583
You can count on my
assistance day or night.

192
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,786
I owe it to you after
all I've put you through.

193
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,156
I do apologize for
all the trouble. Sorry.

194
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,994
[USOPP, LUFFY, SANJI]
Just stop winking already.

195
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,663
Ciao for now!

196
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:31,364
All right!

197
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,366
Rosy Life Riders, ho!

198
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,801
[FISH RIDERS]
Aye-aye, handsome!

199
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,637
[USOPP, LUFFY, SANJI]
Hurry up and leave.

200
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,677
[LUFFY]
I'm finally full!

201
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,313
Ah! That was some good eatin'.

202
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,081
Every bite of it.

203
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,017
That was amazing.

204
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,752
I'm about to burst.

205
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,687
Nyuu!

206
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,790
I'm worn out.
They sure know how to eat.

207
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,925
They must've broken
some kind of record.

208
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,695
I really could've
used six more arms.

209
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,196
Awesome work, Hatchin.

210
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,932
It looks like
they're all satisfied.

211
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,734
Nyuu. Oh, yeah?

212
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,103
Then I'm satisfied, too.

213
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,339
[BROOK]
What a truly splendid afternoon.

214
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,241
My first taste
of octopus fritters

215
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,143
and hopefully not my last.

216
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,013
Uh-oh, do excuse me.

217
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,151
[farts, burps]

218
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,220
Everything about you is nasty!

219
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,891
[SANJI] Hey! Octopus,
Starfish! You too, Camie!

220
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,827
Come take a break up on deck,
I'll make you a cup of tea!

221
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,861
[CAMIE]
Sure!

222
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,103
That's some good tea.

223
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,238
It looks like you guys
are on the right course.

224
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,741
First stop, Sabaody Archipelago.

225
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,975
And we've gotta go there first

226
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,744
if we wanna get
to Fishman Island?

227
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,913
We fishmen and mermaids
could dive right down

228
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,748
and get there in no time at all.

229
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,483
It's not quite
so easy for humans.

230
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,086
The water pressure would
crush you to bits if you tried.

231
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,954
Yeah. No joke.

232
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,257
It was too much for the
Shark Submerge to handle.

233
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,525
That's odd.

234
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,295
I don't imagine it's supposed to
make that horrid creaking noise.

235
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,797
Oh, no. That's bad.

236
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,101
I'm afraid we already
passed 5000 meters.

237
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,103
Ah. That makes sense.

238
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,371
Wait, that is bad!

239
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,006
The water pressure is going
to crush the submarine

240
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,508
like a tin can!

241
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,943
So then how the hell

242
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,244
are we 'sposed
to get down there?

243
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,913
Ahem! Folks.
Attention please.

244
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,382
It's clear to me that
you're downright clueless,

245
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,351
so allow me to
enlighten you about the sea

246
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,120
around these parts.

247
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:34,687
Wait...

248
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,122
Who will enlighten them?

249
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,793
Well, I suppose
that would be this guy!

250
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,162
[HACHI] Yeah.
That sounds pretty good to me.

251
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,799
[PAPPAGU] Um, will
you please listen to me?

252
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,467
[clears throat]

253
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,602
First off--

254
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,037
There are actually two
separate routes one can travel

255
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,472
to reach the New World.

256
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,541
But for outlaws
such as yourselves,

257
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,877
only one of them
is a viable option.

258
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,044
[LUFFY]
Why's that?

259
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,479
Oh, I'll tell you.

260
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,848
You see, the first route
passes over the Red Line

261
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,451
and directly through the
sacred land of Mariejois,

262
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,353
which is protected
by the World Government

263
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,822
and requires their
permission to enter.

264
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,056
Huh?

265
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,092
[PAPPAGU] The World Government's
not exactly fond of pirates,

266
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,094
so I doubt you'd get through.

267
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,296
[CHOPPER] You've gotta cross
the Red Line on foot that way?

268
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,431
How do people get
their ships across?

269
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,332
[PAPPAGU]
The common practice is

270
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,168
for people to leave
their ships behind

271
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,203
and buy a new one
on the other side.

272
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,273
[FRANKY]
They abandon their ships?

273
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,140
Yep.

274
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,975
You've gotta apply
to get permission,

275
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,243
so it takes time and money,

276
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,146
but it is the safest way
to get across.

277
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,581
Good news for you, though.

278
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,049
The passage you'll be taking,

279
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,918
ya don't have
to get rid of your ship.

280
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,588
And that passage is
the great Sea Floor Route.

281
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,257
Straight through Fishman Island!

282
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,192
[CAMIE]
The thing is,

283
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,827
the Sea Floor Route
is pretty dangerous.

284
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,295
[PAPPAGU]
Excuse me, Camie?

285
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,496
--How dangerous we talkin'?
--[PAPPAGU] Camie? I wasn't

286
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,630
--Well, dangerous like it's
--finished talking yet. Hey!

287
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,233
full of sea kings that eat
ships and people and stuff

288
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:54,900
all the time.

289
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,868
[USOPP and CHOPPER]
Huh?

290
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,936
--Yeah, that counts.
--[PAPPAGU] Hey, Camie!

291
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,904
--definitely dangerous.
--I'll take it from here.

292
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,939
Uh-huh.

293
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,944
Y'know, I don't wanna
go to Fishman Island after all.

294
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,412
Yeah, me neither.

295
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,013
Hey, wait, Camie.

296
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,082
Did you say their
ships get eaten?

297
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,483
Huh? Yeah.

298
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,286
What kind of ship will
get us across the sea floor?

299
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,354
[CAMIE]
This one's fine.

300
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,922
[ALL]
Huh?

301
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,259
No. This ship's not equipped
to travel underwater.

302
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,161
Sure, but it will be.

303
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:22,895
Huh?

304
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,129
The thing is,

305
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,498
the Red Line may be the most
massive wall in the whole world,

306
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,200
but it's not totally solid.

307
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,402
And there's one small hole
that passes through it.

308
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,073
Well, small in the big picture.
To us, it's super huge.

309
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,242
And inside that hole
is Fishman Island!

310
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,010
Nyuu!
It's actually right beneath

311
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,511
the sacred land of Mariejois.

312
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,914
All you do is dive down
about thirty thousand feet

313
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,582
and there it is,
in all its glory!

314
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,950
That far?

315
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,186
[HACHI] Trust me,
it's worth the trip.

316
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,455
Then again, I guess we went
about thirty thousand feet

317
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,091
in the air to get to Skypeia.

318
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,326
But taking this ship underwater?

319
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,527
How is that possible?

320
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,129
Oh, we're gonna
get the ship coated

321
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,931
when we reach the island
we're headed to.

322
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,233
Coated with what?

323
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,168
You'll find out
when we get there.

324
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,507
Hey, look up ahead!

325
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,476
We're here, everybody!

326
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,515
It's beautiful!

327
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,183
It sure is. Wow!

328
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,619
What's all that
stuff floating around?

329
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,290
Oh, my.

330
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,925
It's like a dream.

331
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,628
Bubbles?

332
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,532
[PAPPAGU]
This is it!

333
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,812
The Sabaody Archipelago!

334
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,693
[LUFFY]
So cool!

335
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,903
[LUFFY] I've never seen
so many bubbles in my life!

336
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,572
So pretty.

337
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,007
Yow!

338
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:28,479
It's just an
endless barrage of 'em.

339
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:29,947
Where the heck
are they coming from?

340
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,849
[LUFFY] And who's
blowing all of them?

341
00:16:31,882 --> 00:16:34,118
[CAMIE] No one.
The island makes them.

342
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,420
Wait, what?

343
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,756
Yeah, explain.

344
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,491
[ROBIN]
Mind if I interrupt?

345
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,826
Sorry.
I'm not trying to be rude.

346
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,495
But what does the Log Pose say?

347
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:46,930
Oh. Right, just one sec.

348
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:50,000
The needle's still pointing
toward Fishman Island.

349
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:51,535
Let's just hope that this island

350
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,537
isn't gonna rewrite
the log on us.

351
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,838
Nyuu. It's fine.

352
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:57,608
The Sabaody Archipelago's
just a cluster of trees.

353
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,076
There's no magnetic field.

354
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,615
So then it's not
actually a real island?

355
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,582
Right.

356
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:07,618
Are you guys familiar
with mangrove trees?

357
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,886
Mangroves?

358
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,889
[SANJI] Trees with roots
above or under the water,

359
00:17:11,922 --> 00:17:13,924
depending on the tides, right?

360
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:14,858
[HACHI]
Yep, you got it,

361
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,861
but the tide never
rises high enough here

362
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,763
for the roots
to be submerged.

363
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:20,864
The Sabaody Archipelago

364
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,600
is home to the largest
mangrove trees in the world.

365
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,837
These colossal giants are
the Hustle Muscle Mangroves.

366
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,440
The largest
mangroves in the world?

367
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:31,208
Those are some manly mangroves.

368
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,510
This place is great!

369
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,612
[HACHI]
There's a total of 79 trees.

370
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,881
And each one serves
as its own little island

371
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:40,484
complete with tiny
towns and facilities.

372
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,219
The cluster of all
these trees is known as

373
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:44,655
the Sabaody Archipelago.

374
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,622
Huh?

375
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:48,158
[CHOPPER] Look.
They've got numbers on them.

376
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,093
Yeah.

377
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:50,060
All the trees are
designated by number,

378
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:53,130
so it's pretty easy
to find your way around.

379
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:55,966
Grove 44 up here is
the private residence entrance,

380
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:59,069
so before we land, we'll need
to go a little further in.

381
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,475
Wow, when you
see 'em up close,

382
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:06,110
these roots are huge!

383
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,513
[CHOPPER] Look how dark
it is beneath them.

384
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,515
[BROOK]
It is quite fascinating.

385
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,119
[BROOK]
Is that a man-made bridge?

386
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:15,986
[HACHI]
It is.

387
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:18,622
Bridges connect
each one of the islands.

388
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,791
[BROOK]
I see. That makes sense.

389
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,560
[HACHI]
All right! We're here.

390
00:18:23,594 --> 00:18:25,562
This is a good spot
to drop anchor.

391
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,698
Welcome to Grove 41.

392
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,241
First one off the ship!

393
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,611
[LUFFY laughing]

394
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey!

395
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,082
Make sure you all remember
the grove number, okay?

396
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,083
Like I said earlier--

397
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:46,917
The whole archipelago

398
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,919
is connected
by a series of bridges,

399
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:50,554
so you won't get lost
if you remember

400
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,688
the number you're docked at.

401
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:54,024
There's one guy
that'll still get lost.

402
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:55,058
Yep.

403
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,860
[ZORO]
Huh? What's goin' on?

404
00:18:58,295 --> 00:18:59,763
[ZORO]
Hey, what was that for?

405
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:08,172
A bubble popped
out of the ground!

406
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:09,973
How weird is that?

407
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,143
--Awesome!
--Awesome!

408
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:17,848
[LUFFY]
I'm riding it!

409
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,750
That is one strong bubble!

410
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,218
Wow!

411
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,322
These soap bubbles...

412
00:19:25,355 --> 00:19:28,859
I'm curious. How exactly
do they get produced?

413
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:29,893
I got this one.

414
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:30,994
It's a chemical reaction

415
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:32,896
from the Hustle
Muscle Mangrove roots.

416
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,165
They secrete a unique
resin that causes it.

417
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,804
Ugh. It's really sticky.

418
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:43,240
Hey, stop that!

419
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:45,809
[PAPPAGU] You see, when the
roots of the trees breathe,

420
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:48,979
the air inflates the resin
as it rises out of the ground.

421
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:49,980
Interesting.

422
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:52,883
I never would've thought
tree sap could float.

423
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,220
[USOPP] Wow, so this is all
one hundred percent natural.

424
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:57,621
[LUFFY]
Hey!

425
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,488
[USOPP]
Huh? Luffy!

426
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:00,023
When did you get
all the way up there?

427
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,925
[LUFFY] There's an
amusement park over there!

428
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,194
Let's go! I wanna
ride the Ferris wheel!

429
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:05,762
Oh my gosh! Really?

430
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,098
Yeah, that's Sabaody Park.

431
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:09,933
Oh, wow. I'm so jealous.

432
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,869
See, I've always dreamed
of riding that Ferris wheel.

433
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:13,804
You have?

434
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:14,905
Why don't you just ride it?

435
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:15,606
Not a chance!

436
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,374
Don't you even think about it!

437
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:20,043
Yeah. I know, don't remind me.

438
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,048
If she can't ride it,

439
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:26,950
does that mean I can't, either?

440
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,761
So high!

441
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,237
Why are they popping?

442
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:54,144
[screaming]

443
00:20:58,315 --> 00:20:59,316
[CAMIE]
Luffychin!

444
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:01,385
Oh, no! This is awful!

445
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:03,820
[SANJI]
Calm down, he's okay.

446
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:06,356
Trust me, he's the last guy
you've gotta worry about.

447
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,734
Man! That took it outta me!

448
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,003
See?

449
00:21:21,972 --> 00:21:22,906
So, Hachi.

450
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,275
What's our objective
on this island, anyway?

451
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,743
Didn't you say something before

452
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:28,145
about getting
the ship coated here?

453
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:30,213
Nyuu! We'll meet up
with one of the island's

454
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,083
coating specialists and have
him slap a coat of this resin

455
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:34,117
on your ship.

456
00:21:34,785 --> 00:21:35,986
[HACHI]
That's all it takes.

457
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,821
After that, your ship
will be fully equipped

458
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,690
for underwater travel.

459
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,325
Seriously?

460
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:43,293
[HACHI] Yep,
the process works wonders,

461
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,695
and it's the only way I know of

462
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:46,830
that humans can
reach Fishman Island.

463
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:48,432
But you don't want
an amateur to do it.

464
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:49,800
If it's not done right,

465
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,201
the water pressure
will crush the ship

466
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:53,236
and everyone on it.

467
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,839
I've got one specialist
that I really trust, though,

468
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,841
so you'll be in good hands.

469
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,209
Thank you for your help.

470
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:01,378
You really are a good man.

471
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:05,749
Wait. Good octopus.
Yohohohoho!

472
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,950
But first...

473
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:11,188
[HACHI] In exchange for my help,
promise me one thing.

474
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:13,056
Sure. What is it?

475
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,359
[HACHI] Once we cross
the bridge into town,

476
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,195
there's a chance we might
run into the World Nobles.

477
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,230
Okay. Who?

478
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:21,431
Yeah, who're they?

479
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,265
The World Nobles.

480
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,368
They're from the
Holy Land Mariejois.

481
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:26,703
Cool.

482
00:22:26,737 --> 00:22:28,271
So what's the big deal?

483
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,208
This is difficult to ask,

484
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,510
but no matter what
happens in the town,

485
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:35,379
you must promise
that you'll do nothing

486
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:37,080
to defy the World Nobles.

487
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:46,189
No matter what happens?

488
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:48,792
Just ignore it?

489
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,026
[HACHI]
Exactly.

490
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,796
Even if they kill someone
in front of you,

491
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,231
just look the other way.

492
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:58,034
Try to pretend
like nothing happened.

493
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,973
I'll say it one more time.

494
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,078
[HACHI] No matter what, you act
like you didn't see a thing.

495
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,926
[LUFFY] Man, the Sabaody
Archipelago sure is fun!

496
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:25,328
They've got tons of stuff
here I've never seen before!

497
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,864
[CHOPPER] Here come some people
with bubbles on their heads!

498
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:29,900
[LUFFY] Even their dog
is wearing a bubble!

499
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,001
[HACHI]
Crap! Quick!

500
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,335
Get on your knees, guys!

501
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,204
And don't look them in the eye!

502
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:35,972
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

503
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:36,973
"Tyranny!

504
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:40,444
The Rulers of Sabaody,
the Celestial Dragons!"

505
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,913
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
