00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:25.958
[LAW grunts]

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.396
I realize it's important to get
Caesar as far away from here

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:33.105
as possible, and it's pretty
obvious we have to leave now.

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:34.743
But the operation in Dressrosa

00:12:34.776 --> 00:12:37.114
was just supposed
to be a waypoint.

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:39.118
I thought our shared goal
was taking down

00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:41.288
Kaido of the Four Emperors.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.361
[SANJI]
I wonder...

00:12:44.395 --> 00:12:47.100
Why are you getting so
hung up on Doflamingo?

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.235
[LAW grunts]

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.577
[CHOPPER, NAMI screaming]
Meteors! Did you forget?

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.713
[LAW gasps]
Takt!

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.692
[MARINES chattering]

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:02.464
Issho, they managed to
put a hole in the bilge!

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.902
Law's on the ship
below us, isn't he?

00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:09.210
Was mighty careless of me
to overlook that fact.

00:13:09.244 --> 00:13:12.383
Why are you still eating
at a time like this?!

00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:15.824
[FUJITORA]
Hm?

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:32.056
What should we do, sir?

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.571
[FUJITORA] Spin us around
and head back to Dressrosa.

00:13:38.604 --> 00:13:40.206
What?

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:43.747
[FUJITORA]
I've got a premonition.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:48.255
The battle's taking a turn.
Turn the boat around.

00:14:07.493 --> 00:14:09.599
Time to go!
Everyone ready?

00:14:09.632 --> 00:14:10.701
Almost there!

00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:13.072
Ready when you are, Nami!

00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:19.451
[DOFLAMINGO laughs]
There's no escape!

00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.589
The whip again? Great!

00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:24.361
Joker! Get me off of this boat!

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:25.831
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:14:27.635 --> 00:14:29.337
Overheat!

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:32.110
Not good!

00:14:32.143 --> 00:14:33.580
[SANJI, MOMONOSUKE gasping]

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:43.432
Nami!

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:45.971
Look for a spot without any
clouds and set sail for it now!

00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:47.842
What? But why?

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:50.080
[LAW] Because...
Doflamingo has the powers

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:51.582
of the String String Fruit.

00:14:51.616 --> 00:14:54.487
He moves through the air by
attaching strings to clouds.

00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:57.427
A clear sky means
he can't chase you!

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.968
I see. Well,
that explains a lot.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:03.607
What are you waiting around for?

00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:07.013
Coup De Burst! Fire!

00:15:09.017 --> 00:15:11.522
Doflamingo! Eyes over here!

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:12.290
Huh?

00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:17.033
Ah! Law! How could you do this?

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:18.903
[DOFLAMINGO growls]

00:15:18.937 --> 00:15:20.874
[GIOLLA] Don't worry about me,
Young Master!

00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:23.011
You can't let them escape!

00:15:39.946 --> 00:15:41.583
Don't run away yet!

00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:44.522
There's somethin' important
I gotta ask you!

00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:48.897
Hey! I'm talking to you
on the second floor!

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.771
I know you're up there!
Say something!

00:15:52.804 --> 00:15:55.309
What gives?
Can't you hear me?!

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:57.714
I see you!

00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.088
Hey!

00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:03.827
[BARTOLOMEO sobbing]
First...

00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:07.868
I got the chance to meet
my hero, Mister Luffy.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:13.045
And now, I have the privilege of
being yelled at by Mister Zoro!

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:17.220
These tears of joy shall flow
until the end of time!

00:16:18.456 --> 00:16:20.360
[KIN'EMON] Are we certain
this is a coliseum

00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:22.463
and not some sort of asylum?

00:16:22.497 --> 00:16:25.537
All right. I don't know who
you are, but can you tell us

00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:28.242
if there's another way
into the coliseum here?

00:16:28.276 --> 00:16:30.981
All the entrances
I can find are closed up!

00:16:31.014 --> 00:16:33.553
[BARTOLOMEO gasps]
Did...

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:39.497
Did the legendary swordsman Zoro
direct a question at me?

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:44.542
I'm so glad I became a pirate!
I can die happy! [laughs]

00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:46.612
[ZORO]
What is he talkin' about?

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:48.082
[KIN'EMON] Perhaps those bars
are to keep him

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:49.685
away from the public.

00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:54.294
Shut up! Calm down and listen!
Is there a door?

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:57.367
I wish you coulda been in
the stands to see his match!

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.904
There wasn't one fighter here

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.342
that could lay a hand
on Mister Luffy!

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:03.646
[grunts] Wait a moment!

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.917
First he can tell who
you are by sight alone,

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:08.088
and now it appears
he knows Luffy, too?

00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:10.193
[ZORO]
Hmm?

00:17:10.226 --> 00:17:12.598
[KIN'EMON] Who is this man,
and how was he able to discern

00:17:12.632 --> 00:17:16.038
your identities through
your flawless disguises?

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:18.877
[ZORO]
Yeah, I know, right?

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.653
[CROWD cheering]

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:28.764
Now, for the final battle
royale in this competition!

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:32.137
Only one from Block D will win,
moving on to compete in

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.276
the finals with the other
three champions!

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.480
And every fighter
out there is determined

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.752
to earn that fourth spot!

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:45.764
[COMPETITOR F groaning]

00:17:45.797 --> 00:17:48.603
[REBECCA panting]

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.243
[CAVENDISH]
There's something about her.

00:17:52.276 --> 00:17:54.915
She's not just
another gladiator.

00:17:57.854 --> 00:17:59.357
[CAVENDISH]
She doesn't attack.

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:04.467
Passing up even critical chances
to strike her opponent. But why?

00:18:06.872 --> 00:18:07.874
[REBECCA grunts]

00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:16.224
[COMPETITORS chuckle]

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:22.638
[CAVENDISH]
What is she doing?

00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:24.675
Backing to the edge
of the ring like that?

00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:25.811
[CAVENDISH grunts]

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:28.750
Get your head in the game
or lose it, pretty boy!

00:18:28.784 --> 00:18:31.856
Don't think about
trying to be a hero!

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:33.960
Rebecca can handle
herself, 'kay?

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:34.796
Huh?

00:18:34.829 --> 00:18:37.033
[REBECCA grunting]

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:40.841
[INMATES cheering]

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:42.310
A little more and you got it!

00:18:42.343 --> 00:18:44.849
But do yourself a favor
and stop backin' up!

00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.753
You tryin' to knock
yourself outta the ring?

00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:48.389
That's what I'm talkin' about!

00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:49.625
This is gonna be sweet!

00:18:49.658 --> 00:18:51.629
I thought you were on her side!

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:54.000
Just wait! She's about
to do somethin' cool!

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:55.169
[LUFFY]
Hm?

00:19:00.113 --> 00:19:04.287
[panting]

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.293
You're gonna bleed,
ya little tramp!

00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:13.339
Join your family in hell!

00:19:13.372 --> 00:19:15.910
Finish her off already!

00:19:19.518 --> 00:19:22.022
[COMPETITORS]
Die!

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:26.566
[COMPETITORS yelling]

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.834
[REBECCA grunts]

00:19:35.718 --> 00:19:38.890
[gasping]

00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:40.459
[AGILIA laughs]

00:19:40.492 --> 00:19:42.531
[LUFFY gasping]

00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:50.413
[panting]

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:51.415
What'd I tell ya?

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:52.651
[CAVENDISH gasps]

00:19:52.684 --> 00:19:56.025
[INMATES cheering]

00:19:56.058 --> 00:20:00.232
[INMATE D]
Nice goin', Rebecca! Atta girl!

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:02.437
That's crazy!

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.807
What happened?

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.612
I'm not even sure
what I just saw!

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:18.770
[SANJI] Yeah. We barely escaped
both the Navy and Doflamingo.

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.674
We're gonna head for Zou now.

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:22.678
[USOPP]
Wait, Zou? Hold on, Sanji!

00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:24.848
You guys aren't planning
on leaving us here?

00:20:24.882 --> 00:20:27.353
Sorry, but you've gotta find
a way out yourselves.

00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:31.060
You serious? Look, I'm ready
to get outta this place.

00:20:31.094 --> 00:20:33.934
I don't like the way things
are playing out here at all.

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:36.037
Swing by and pick us up!

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.406
[SANJI]
No can do.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.446
Hey! Don't pay
attention to Usopp!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.619
Head to Zou, zoo, or wherever,
and don't worry!

00:20:43.653 --> 00:20:46.959
We'll bring that factory
to the ground, no problemo!

00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:48.897
Say, what're Luffy
and Law up to?

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.234
Zoro and Kin'emon
are trying to find Luffy

00:20:51.268 --> 00:20:53.673
and bring him up to speed.

00:20:53.707 --> 00:20:55.577
And Law...

00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:29.545
[footsteps]

00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:41.569
[footsteps continue]

00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:52.591
What's the point of letting
half the Straw Hats escape?

00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:55.062
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:21:56.398 --> 00:21:58.736
[DOFLAMINGO] The rest of them
are still in Dressrosa.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.809
All I have to do is take them
hostage and the ones who ran off

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:05.918
will sail right back and offer
me Caesar for their release.

00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:08.055
[LAW] How many people have
underestimated them

00:22:08.088 --> 00:22:09.692
and gotten burned?

00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:12.463
You really wanna add
your name to that list?

00:22:17.306 --> 00:22:20.345
[LAW] At any rate, my pirate
alliance with the Straw Hat crew

00:22:20.379 --> 00:22:23.151
is coming to its
natural conclusion.

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:24.888
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

00:22:24.922 --> 00:22:27.126
Do I have to spell it
out for you?

00:22:27.159 --> 00:22:29.197
From the moment we teamed up,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.070
my only goal was shutting
down the SMILE factory,

00:22:32.103 --> 00:22:34.675
I was using them.

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:37.180
And while killing you today
would bring me pleasure,

00:22:37.213 --> 00:22:41.689
it doesn't matter. Since Kaido
will do it sooner or later.

00:22:41.722 --> 00:22:44.628
After you end up
losing the SMILEs.

00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:50.138
How noble of you.

00:22:50.172 --> 00:22:53.613
Sacrificing your life
to stop me.

00:22:53.646 --> 00:22:56.351
[LAW] While I'd love to see
what chaos the world falls into

00:22:56.385 --> 00:22:59.490
once you're dead,
first and foremost,

00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:04.635
I want to make you pay for
what you did 13 years ago...

00:23:04.668 --> 00:23:06.839
Joker!

00:23:14.487 --> 00:23:17.093
[NARRATOR] Still holding onto
13 years of resentment,

00:23:17.126 --> 00:23:19.632
Law and Doflamingo
confront one another.

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:21.836
Meanwhile, in the
Corrida Colosseum,

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.608
Rebecca finds herself pushed
towards the edge of the ring.

00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:27.313
Suddenly, she unleashes the
special technique she learned

00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:30.687
from the one-legged soldier
who was so dear to her heart.

00:23:30.721 --> 00:23:32.156
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:35.864
"Rebecca's Special Attack!
Back-to-the-Water Dance!"

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:38.502
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
