1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,574
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,577
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:45,123
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,378
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,214
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,593
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,637
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,183
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,269
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,898
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,858
[YORKI]
Laboon!

48
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,485
Once we travel the world,
we're comin' right back here!

49
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
You just wait for us!

50
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,032
[LABOON vocalizes]

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,590
[BROOK] Laboon, thank you
for waiting for us.

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,718
I know that 50 years
is a long time.

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,222
But please, do you think
you could be patient

54
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,432
for one or two more?

55
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,730
[BROOK]
I have my pride as a pirate.

56
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,609
I promised you I would see you
again after circling the globe.

57
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,613
I intend to keep my word and
return from the right direction.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,576
[LUFFY]
A New Crewmate!

59
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,995
The Musician, Humming Brook!

60
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,500
[ROLLING PIRATE 381A]
Hey, Skeleton!

61
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,210
[ROLLING PIRATE 381B]
You ain't singing anymore?

62
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,461
[ROLLING PIRATE 381C]
One more song!

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,712
Come on!

64
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,508
[BROOK]
Yoho!

65
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,386
[BROOK]
When this was recorded,

66
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,430
my comrades and I
knew the end was near.

67
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,474
But we sang our hearts out

68
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,144
because this would be the
Rumbar Pirate's swan song.

69
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,313
For over fifty years
I sailed alone,

70
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,692
drifting aimlessly
in that dark, misty sea.

71
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,319
Hearing this song
was my only comfort.

72
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,328
All alone on that giant ship.

73
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,622
This made me feel human.

74
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,332
In that sad and lonely place,

75
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,751
it was my only link
to other people.

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,718
But now, I will
proceed with a new strength

77
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,594
and I can seal
this Tone Dial away

78
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,181
until it can finally
fulfill its original purpose.

79
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,070
Goodbye!

80
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,822
Whoa!

81
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,699
He did that weird
head thing again!

82
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,117
[LUFFY laughing]

83
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,202
[piano music]

84
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,038
I'm glad to hear
that Laboon is well

85
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,248
and still waiting for me.

86
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,127
My shadow has returned, and
we're leaving the Devil's Sea.

87
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,713
And although
the voices in this dial

88
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
kept me sane all those years,

89
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,051
I must remember that
it was not for my sake

90
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,094
that they were first recorded.

91
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,473
This is a song for Laboon
to remember his old friends.

92
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,393
[BROOK] Every day on
that boat was difficult,

93
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,604
and there was no end in sight.

94
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,814
Frankly, I'd given up all hope.

95
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,320
But Luffy, you know what?

96
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,363
[LUFFY]
Hm?

97
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,493
I'm... so...

98
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,086
I'm so glad
to still be alive!

99
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:23,800
[BROOK sobbing]

100
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,718
[BROOK] I'm so glad
I never gave up.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,388
No matter how hard it was!

102
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,265
Well, of course, right?

103
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:36,771
[BROOK] I've waited so long
for this day to come!

104
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,650
[BROOK sobbing]

105
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,444
Ah...

106
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,864
So does the offer to join
your crew still stand?

107
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,366
[LUFFY]
Yeah, welcome aboard.

108
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,701
What? Just like that?

109
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,578
For real?

110
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,205
[screaming]

111
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,249
[laughing]

112
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,625
[USOPP]
But good to have you!

113
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,128
We finally got our musician!

114
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,840
[LUFFY] He may be all bones,
but he sure knows how to play!

115
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:07,635
I've been wanting a
musician since forever!

116
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,805
[CHOPPER] He had a heavy heart,
but he's light as a feather!

117
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,307
[USOPP] By the way, what do
you call a singing skeleton?

118
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,475
Yeah, tell us, Brook!

119
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,311
A natural bone singer!

120
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,689
[laughing]

121
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,690
[BROOK]
"Bone," get it?

122
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,399
--It's funny because...
--[LUFFY] He's so funny!

123
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,775
Do you get it?
It's funny!

124
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,318
[NAMI]
Yeah, I got it.

125
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,530
The crew certainly
is lively now, huh?

126
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,740
Why do we always
have to attract those types?

127
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,451
So noisy.

128
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,743
[LOLA] I don't know
what's going on,

129
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,537
but congratulations, Namizo!

130
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,330
Uh, thanks, I guess.

131
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,665
I don't know
what's going on, but...

132
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,500
Cheers!

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,626
I'm confused, too, but...

134
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,378
Cheers!

135
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,632
45 degrees!

136
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:51,679
[laughing]

137
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,569
[BROOK]
Laboon.

138
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,618
[LABOON vocalizing]

139
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,663
[BROOK] I won't turn back,
not after coming so far.

140
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,499
I may have been
sidetracked for a while,

141
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,834
but I'm headed
straight forward again.

142
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:26,631
All the way around the world,
back to Twin Cape, so far away.

143
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,925
Because I know
you'll be waiting for me,

144
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,385
and I have to keep my promise.

145
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,763
Both to you and my crew.

146
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,308
So I will see this
to the end no matter what.

147
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,851
So wait for me.

148
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,481
Just a little bit longer.

149
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:55,576
[LABOON vocalizing]

150
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,495
Huh?

151
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,419
Hey, Laboon. What's wrong?

152
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:14,929
[cheering]

153
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:21,727
[LABOON vocalizing]

154
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
Well you seem to
be in high spirits today.

155
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,606
I wonder why.

156
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:31,821
[LABOON vocalizing]

157
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,745
Yohohohoho!

158
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,291
[BROOK]
Take a look at this.

159
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:43,874
[FRANKY]
Huh?

160
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,834
A wanted poster?

161
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,545
You mean you already
have a bounty on you?

162
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,338
[BROOK] Pardon me for
not introducing myself

163
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,464
properly before.

164
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:56,554
I am known as Dead Bones Brook,
and I'm a wanted man.

165
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,514
My nickname is
"The Humming Swordsman."

166
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,851
I have a bounty of 33
million berries on my head.

167
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,644
I was the leader
of a battle convoy

168
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,438
in the kingdom of my origin.

169
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,982
Afterwards, I served
as a musician and swordsman

170
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,526
in the Rumbar Pirates,
later succeeding Yorki

171
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,862
as captain of the crew
until their demise.

172
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,782
But now, I pledge
my life and my services

173
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:20,411
to Captain Monkey D. Luffy
of the Straw Hat Pirates.

174
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,914
I shall do my best
to make you proud.

175
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,374
That is to say...

176
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,461
I shall work myself to the bone!

177
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,380
Yohohohoho!

178
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,673
All right!

179
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,758
One more toast!

180
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,469
Raise your glasses!

181
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,832
[BROOK]
Yohohohoho!

182
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,336
[BROOK]
How splendid!

183
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,546
Thank you Franky, Usopp.

184
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,839
It's perfect!

185
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,840
No prob, bro.

186
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,176
I can make one of these
any day of the week!

187
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,345
But it was my design,
just so ya know.

188
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,181
Yeah, but I picked
out the flowers!

189
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,183
Thank you so much, Chopper.

190
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,476
They're lovely.

191
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,728
Oh you boney bastard!

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,189
Flattery won't get you
anywhere with me!

193
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,652
[BROOK] But truly.
It's a beautiful memorial.

194
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,278
And this is
certainly for the best,

195
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,364
since I could scarcely
bring all of those bones

196
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
onto Mr. Lion with me.

197
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,575
[FRANKY] Okay, but
it's "Thousand Sunny,"

198
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,369
not "Mr. Lion!"

199
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,454
[BROOK] You know,
by happy coincidence,

200
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,790
Thriller Bark originally
came from the West Blue,

201
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,251
just like the Rumbar Pirates.

202
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,254
Despite the troubles
this ship brought me, I...

203
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,714
I hope my friends
will rest peacefully

204
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,674
in the soil of their homeland.

205
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,010
[USOPP] We're gonna
head back now, Brook.

206
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,262
We'll see you soon.

207
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,263
[FRANKY]
Glad you like it.

208
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:02,972
[CHOPPER]
Bye-bye.

209
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,223
[BROOK]
Thank you.

210
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:19,530
[violin playing 'Binks' Brew']

211
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,574
[violin continues]

212
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,636
Goodness, you gave me a fright.

213
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,347
You were out for quite a while--
are you feeling better?

214
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,389
[ZORO]
Yeah.

215
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,433
I overslept a bit.

216
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,476
[BROOK]
And what is that?

217
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,520
[ZORO]
A dead sword, Yubashiri.

218
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,563
I'm laying it to rest here, too.

219
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,326
Luffy is the man who will
become King of the Pirates!

220
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,332
[BROOK]
Uhm...

221
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,500
[ZORO]
What is it?

222
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,503
No, nothing.

223
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,841
Oh, uh, in case
you hadn't heard,

224
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,051
I officially joined the crew.

225
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,594
[ZORO]
Heh, I see.

226
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,555
Well, that's too bad
for you, now, isn't it?

227
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,597
[BROOK]
Huh?

228
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,018
This crew can be
a real handful, that's all.

229
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,353
Yohohoho!

230
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,479
So it would seem,

231
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,606
but I'll give them my blood
and sweat all the same--

232
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,942
except I don't have any,
since I'm a skeleton.

233
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,510
[LUFFY] Zoro's up,
so on to our next adventure!

234
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,638
Come on, it's time to set sail!

235
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
[ALL]
Yeah!

236
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,808
Hey!

237
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,894
Zoro, you took off
your bandages!

238
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,769
[ZORO]
Of course I did!

239
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,438
They made it hard to move.

240
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,355
That's the point!

241
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,733
You're supposed to
sit still and heal!

242
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,443
--[CHOPPER] C'mere!
--Setting off already?

243
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,069
I'm sorry you can't
stick around.

244
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,571
Whenever you feel like leaving,

245
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,072
you can take Brook's ship.

246
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,450
I fixed the rudder
and the sails for you.

247
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,409
[LOLA]
It's wonderful.

248
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,786
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

249
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,787
It might take
the rest of my life

250
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,873
for me to pay you back,
but I'm willing to try.

251
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,667
In other words, what do you
say you and I get married?

252
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,961
Sorry babe, you're
a gem, but it won't work out.

253
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,505
I'm afraid I'm just
too super to settle down.

254
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,424
I really hate
to see you take off.

255
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,926
You sure you don't wanna
stick around and party

256
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,594
--for a few more days?
--[LUFFY] No way!

257
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,014
We're off to Fishman Island and
it's gonna be totally awesome!

258
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:32,973
Fish dudes!

259
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,434
There's gonna be fish dudes!

260
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,477
Screw the fish dudes!

261
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,770
There're gonna be mermaids!

262
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,606
I'm gonna flirt
with all of them!

263
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,650
Ah, I wonder if the
mermaids we encounter

264
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,110
would be so gracious
as to show me their panties.

265
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,612
Hey man, don't be dumb.

266
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,447
Think about what you're sayin!

267
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,951
Mermaids don't wear any panties!

268
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,828
[RISKY BRO BROWN HAIR]
And I'm tellin' ya.

269
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,538
Mermaids are so gorgeous,

270
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,791
they even give the
Pirate Empress Hancock

271
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,542
a run for her money!

272
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,211
[SANJI and BROOK]
Mermaids, yeah!

273
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,254
Mermaids, yeah!

274
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,465
Mermaids are fish
from the waist down.

275
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,801
Why do you guys know
so much about Fishman Island?

276
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh, well,
couple 'a years back

277
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,930
before we got stuck in this
hellhole, we took a trip there.

278
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,890
You are gonna love it!

279
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,266
Wow Lola, I didn't realize

280
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,143
you went to the
New World already!

281
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,937
[LOLA] We didn't go there,
you big silly,

282
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,647
we came from there
in the first place!

283
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,191
My Momma's a pirate
just like me, y'know!

284
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,069
Oh. That reminds me.

285
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,821
Here, you should take this.

286
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,115
It's my momma's Vivre Card.

287
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,241
[NAMI]
A piece of paper?

288
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,867
Whoa, hang on to that one.

289
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,245
One of the greatest pirates
I've ever met in my life

290
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,955
is Lola's mom!

291
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,581
[LUFFY]
Hm?

292
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,374
[RISKY BRO MASK]
That'll come in handy someday!

293
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,626
Not just anybody
gets one of those!

294
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,503
Sorry, but what's
a Vivre Card again?

295
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,838
What? You guys don't know?

296
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,840
C'mon Captain,
don't be insensitive.

297
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,050
They only make Vivre Cards
in the New World!

298
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,927
Oh, I forgot about that.

299
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,013
Anyway, this is no normal paper.

300
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,849
You can wet it or burn it
but it won't change.

301
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,308
If you take a
piece of your fingernail

302
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,935
to the shop
where they make these,

303
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,312
they'll use it to create
a personalized piece of paper.

304
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,856
Just like this one.

305
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,940
Because of their use,

306
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,860
they also call Vivre Cards
"Life Paper" sometimes.

307
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,194
The idea is to tear off a piece

308
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,696
and give it to your
family or friends

309
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,197
when you go on a journey.

310
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,867
Uh-huh? And then what?

311
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,826
[LOLA]
Take a look.

312
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,162
This is the Vivre Card
I got from my momma.

313
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,291
[NAMI]
Ah! It's moving!

314
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,585
[LOLA] No matter where in the
world these scraps of paper are,

315
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,961
they're drawn to each other.

316
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
So long as I have this,

317
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,256
I know what direction
Momma is in.

318
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,592
It doesn't tell you the
distance, though, I'm afraid.

319
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,218
Whoa, that's so neat!

320
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,095
I bet there's a bunch
of crazy stuff like that

321
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,889
in the New World, huh?

322
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,098
Well, I don't know
about "crazy,"

323
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,224
but it certainly is handy.

324
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,894
Anyway, I'm signing the
piece of my Momma's Vivre Card,

325
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,021
so if you're ever in trouble,
you can use it to find her

326
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,898
and she'll help you out.

327
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,940
If that ever happens,

328
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,359
be sure to tell her
that I'm doing fine, okay?

329
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,402
Wow, thanks, Lola.

330
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,781
Hey, hold on, don't I have
one of those already?

331
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,907
Huh?

332
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,367
I almost forgot, but Ace
gave you something like this

333
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,744
a long time ago.

334
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,245
You remember that, right?

335
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,085
That scrap of paper
will reunite us someday.

336
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,050
[LUFFY]
So that's what it was.

337
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,761
This is it, but...
Huh, that's weird.

338
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,263
I thought you said
these things couldn't burn.

339
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,306
[yelling]

340
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,057
Are you kidding?

341
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,308
Let me see that!

342
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,649
[LOLA] This is definitely
a Vivre Card,

343
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,235
but there's something I
neglected to tell you before.

344
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,780
The life force of the owner
is also reflected on the paper.

345
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,200
Does this belong
to someone close to you?

346
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,076
Yeah!

347
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,911
It's my big brother's.

348
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,250
Lola?

349
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,839
[LOLA]
I'm sorry to say this,

350
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,971
but your brother's life is
in terrible danger right now.

351
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:33,630
--Bye!
--Bye bye!

352
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,800
See ya! Good luck!

353
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:37,759
We owe you our lives!

354
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,554
We won't forget what
you've done, Straw Hat!

355
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,599
Thank you
for giving us the sun!

356
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,477
Take care!

357
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,396
Don't get annihilated out there.

358
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,565
That would be very bad!
Yohohohoho!

359
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,524
Why would you
even say that?

360
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,734
Are you out of your mind?

361
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,486
Bye Lola, and thanks
for the Vivre Card!

362
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,821
I'll miss you!

363
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,615
I hope we
meet again someday!

364
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,910
If you see my momma,
tell her I said hi, Namizo!

365
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,751
[LUFFY]
Set sail!

366
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,604
Well, I guess
they're gone now.

367
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,605
Yeah.

368
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,234
[LOLA] Hm? Looks like
the fog's come back.

369
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,152
We set sail tomorrow!

370
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,613
[ROLLING PIRATES]
Roger!

371
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,114
[NARRATOR] No one knows
the truth behind

372
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:45,994
what happens in this Sea of
Mysteries, the Florian Triangle.

373
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:51,124
Each year, over 100 ships sail
into the mists, never to return.

374
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,001
The giant ship, Thriller Bark,

375
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,630
first dropped anchor in these
dark waters 10 years ago,

376
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,091
but the tales of terror
and disappearances

377
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:09,559
came long before then.

378
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,103
Perhaps it is fortunate
that the thick mist

379
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,897
is abundant
on this day as well,

380
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,817
cloaking the terrors of
these mysterious waters

381
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,860
like a white veil.

382
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,199
[NAMI]
Luffy...

383
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,659
Huh?

384
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,536
You sure you're okay with this?

385
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,328
[LUFFY]
Hm?

386
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,664
Oh right,
you mean Ace's paper.

387
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,667
Eh, he'll be fine.
Don't worry about it.

388
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,796
Luffy, we can take
a detour, if you like.

389
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,131
I wouldn't mind.

390
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,009
[BROOK] Time has proven
to be no obstacle

391
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,677
to either me or Laboon.

392
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,847
So long as I draw breath, I
know we'll be reunited someday.

393
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,015
[USOPP]
Yeah, it's fine!

394
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,851
You do what you want, Captain,
we don't care one bit!

395
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,812
Yeah, I'm ready to go anywhere!

396
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,231
I wanna meet Luffy's
bro and the big whale bro!

397
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,774
Seriously, it's okay.

398
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,693
Even if Ace was
in some kinda trouble,

399
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,070
he wouldn't want his little
brother to come bail him out.

400
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,322
That'd drive him crazy.

401
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,658
He hates to show his weak side
and he never asks for help.

402
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,955
If I saved his life,
he'd probably just get mad.

403
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,291
[LUFFY] As pirates, we're
supposed to be rivals anyway.

404
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,045
His adventures are his business,
even if they turn out bad.

405
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,171
Well, keep your hopes up.

406
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,798
Lola's pals were saying
the card doesn't just shrink

407
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,883
when someone's in trouble.

408
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,844
It also grows bigger
if things get better for them.

409
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,054
Good.

410
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,597
Then I'll see him again when
he's back to full strength!

411
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,723
I'm sure that's
what he was thinking

412
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,933
when he gave me
that card, right?

413
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,856
Oh yeah, Zoro.

414
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,066
You were asleep
for the big party

415
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,943
so I guess you
missed out on this.

416
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,279
Well, no harm in doing it
one more time, right?

417
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,073
Let's all raise our mugs
in celebration

418
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,909
of our newest crewmember,
the musician, Brook!

419
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,079
[ALL]
Cheers!

420
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,748
[BROOK]
Really, you're too kind!

421
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,334
[LUFFY]
Full speed ahead!

422
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,087
Let's get moving
with a Coup de Burst!

423
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,755
[ALL]
Yeah!

424
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,217
[FRANKY]
Coup de Burst!

425
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:07,803
We're flying!

426
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,346
What's going on?

427
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,109
[NAMI] Blue water
and a beautiful sun!

428
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,193
This is the life!

429
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,320
[LUFFY] Cool! They got
a bunch of neat stuff here!

430
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,155
[FOXY]
Fehfehfehfeh!

431
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,782
[LUFFY]
Hey! It's splithead!

432
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,617
[FOXY]
Who you calling splithead?

433
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,744
I'm gonna put an end
to your wise cracks

434
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,788
with my amazing new technique!

435
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,164
On the next One Piece:

436
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,416
"The Slow-Slow Menace!

437
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,835
Silver Fox Foxy Returns!"

438
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,337
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
