1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:38,032
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:40,502
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,173
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:50,211
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:54,115
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,485
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,921
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,954 --> 00:03:03,358
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,327
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:09,230
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,772
[USOPP] That sounds painful.

48
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,008
So, for the time being,
I'm staying right where I am.

49
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,477
All we gotta do is wait
for Luffy to show up.

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,344
He'll save us.

51
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:24,212
[CHOPPER] I think
he's right, Nami.

52
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,447
This island's way
too creepy for us!

53
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,483
I'm not going through
that graveyard again!

54
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,617
Huh?!

55
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:32,120
Huh?

56
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:36,157
[NAMI] Usopp! Chopper!

57
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,092
Did you just now call for us?

58
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,663
[ABSALOM] Damn them.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,201
[FRANKY] Whoa.

60
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:48,369
Look at what I caught!

61
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,705
Please just
lemme go!

62
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,340
You're so cool!

63
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:53,942
How 'bout you join
my pirate crew?

64
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:55,376
Overruled, dumbass!

65
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,946
You're there--
right, Absalom?

66
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,083
[ABSALOM] I'm on the
hunt for a bride, Hogback.

67
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:05,420
The redhead.
I quite fancy her.

68
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,289
I'll make her mine soon enough.

69
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:14,095
[chuckles]

70
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,135
You're shaking
like leaves on a tree.

71
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,606
How adorable!
Wanna know a secret?

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,044
You're so cute I could
swallow you whole right now!

73
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:32,080
Nami! Chopper!
Open the door!

74
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:33,982
We need to get outta here!

75
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:38,052
What are you doing, Nami?

76
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,656
You're kidding, right?

77
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:42,490
No, I'm not!

78
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,726
We're really trapped
in here, Usopp!

79
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,062
How dare you set me on fire,

80
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,064
you dumb little pyro?

81
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,968
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 341E] You're
not getting away that easy!

82
00:04:56,704 --> 00:05:01,309
[USOPP] No!

83
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,448
[LUFFY] "The Zombie's Secret!

84
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:09,550
Hogback's Nightmarish
Laboratory!"

85
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,423
What now?

86
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,532
That was way too close!

87
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,335
We gotta get to a different
room! Anything beats this!

88
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,037
Not so fast!

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,439
Auuugh!!

90
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,245
[USOPP] No no no!

91
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,617
Aaaaah!!

92
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,353
This isn't a way out,
it's just the fireplace!

93
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,193
We're dead!
There's nowhere else to run!

94
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,561
Shut up!

95
00:06:07,308 --> 00:06:08,543
[USOPP] Where the heck are we?

96
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,544
[RANDOM PAINTING ZOMBIE 342A]
Damn it!

97
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,246
What happened?
They disappeared all of sudden!

98
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,347
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 341A]
Not quite.

99
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,483
There's a secret passageway
behind the fireplace.

100
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:16,584
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 342F]
If we don't catch them,

101
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,720
they're gonna make it to
Dr. Hogback's research lab!

102
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,321
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 342D] Push!

103
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,566
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 342F]
It's no good.

104
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,835
They must be blocking
it from the other side!

105
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,871
Could you scoot over, Usopp?

106
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:39,474
I don't have any room to push!

107
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,892
Heheheheh!

108
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,428
Run and run wherever
you like, little humans, you'll

109
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,532
find that the mansion is full of
Surprise Zombies at every turn!

110
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,749
[NAMI] This hallway is bad!

111
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,785
Any place with paintings is bad!

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,821
There's gotta be a room
in here somewhere!

113
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,556
That's it!

114
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:49,744
Paintings!

115
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:54,682
[USOPP] Oh, they're just photos.

116
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,552
Phew. No zombies.
Everything's fine.

117
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,888
Hey, wait. It's
that girl from before.

118
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:05,760
The one who hates
plates so much. Cindry.

119
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,435
It's weird.
What is this room?

120
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:23,811
Now that I get a better look,
she's really pretty, isn't she?

121
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:25,947
She sure doesn't look
like a servant, though.

122
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,917
But wait, you don't think
this place is her room, do you?

123
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,553
[NAMI] That'd be a little odd.

124
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:33,855
I mean, who would
have so many photos

125
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,923
of themselves in their own room?

126
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,859
[CHOPPER] What about all
those big stitches she's got?

127
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,261
They aren't in
any of the photos.

128
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,833
You're right.
And look at that smile.

129
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,468
She's like a completely
different person

130
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,603
than the one we met.

131
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:51,572
Maybe these are old photos
and she had some accident.

132
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:53,407
I mean, it's gotta be her!

133
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:03,484
[NAMI] Let's see.

134
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,288
Victoria Cindry.

135
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:11,859
[NAMI] Evidently she used to
be a really popular actress.

136
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:15,329
Take a look, all these
articles are about her.

137
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,932
[USOPP] Huh? She was an actress?

138
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:19,367
I thought they said
she got into trouble

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,502
for breaking a bunch
of plates or something.

140
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:23,871
So you mean she wasn't
a servant after all?

141
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,573
On the contrary,

142
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,443
this says she came from
an aristocratic family.

143
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:32,046
She had a successful
career on the stage,

144
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,916
and even as a child,
she had a lot of fans.

145
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:38,552
[USOPP] What is it?

146
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:42,723
[NAMI] These articles are old.

147
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:47,295
Ten years ago she fell from the
stage, and died in an accident.

148
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:51,032
Aaaah!

149
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,066
[USOPP]
B-But that can't be right!

150
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,267
We saw her ourselves!

151
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,970
I mean, she is kinda creepy,
but she's definitely alive!

152
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:56,971
He's right,

153
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:59,907
so if what that article
says is true after all--

154
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:02,376
She must have come
back from the dead.

155
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,978
There's no other answer!

156
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,349
All those zombies we saw

157
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,351
weren't some kind
of weird monsters.

158
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,953
They were people and animals,

159
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,698
who had died and been
brought back to life!

160
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:40,022
[USOPP] I don't
like this at all.

161
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,358
I don't even wanna
think about it anymore.

162
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,928
Let's just forget we ever
came here and run away.

163
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,698
What now?

164
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,771
Wait a sec!
Is that what I think it is?

165
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,541
It is-- It's a treasure chest!

166
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,875
Better already?

167
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,677
[NAMI] Well, what're
you waiting for, Usopp!

168
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,446
Open it up! Come on!

169
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,847
Ah, uh, right.

170
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:10,953
Sorry suckers, but there's
no treasure in this room!

171
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,490
It's a Jack-in-the-box!

172
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,033
There you are!

173
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,002
[USOPP]
Painting zombies!

174
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,443
[NAMI thinking] He said there
was no treasure in that room.

175
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:37,413
They must be hiding
something somewhere else.

176
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
It's the bodyguard.

177
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,523
[RYUMA] It seems
some lost lambs

178
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,625
have wandered into the mansion.

179
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,827
[PAINTING ZOMBIE 342L]
Oh, you're just in time!

180
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,865
[RYUMA] But never fear.
I shall herd them up.

181
00:11:55,898 --> 00:12:02,104
Nyohohohoho!!
Nyohohohoho!!

182
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,890
[SANJI] For the
last time, Luffy.

183
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,725
The skeleton was bad enough,

184
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,561
we don't need trees
and unicorns on the crew.

185
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:26,529
I mean, look.

186
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:27,963
We've already got a
raccoon dog and a robot.

187
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,064
That's messed up enough.

188
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,699
[FRANKY] Hey, how many
times do I gotta tell you--

189
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,535
I'm not a robot, I'm a cyborg!

190
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,770
[SANJI] All right, whatever,
either way you're not human!

191
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,072
In my heart I'm a
human--that's what matters!

192
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,108
In your heart,
you're a pervert, pal!

193
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,677
Oh, then you
understand after all.

194
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,646
No, that was not a compliment.

195
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,148
[LUFFY] What kinda
monsters are we gonna see?

196
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,452
I hope they join the crew
and come along with me!

197
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,932
There's something
I couldn't help but notice

198
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,668
about that tree man
and the unicorn earlier.

199
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,503
What's that?

200
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,171
[ROBIN] Just like our
doggie friend here,

201
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,673
all of the creatures
in this forest seem

202
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,107
to have heavy injuries.

203
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,944
Big stitches and numbers
written on them somewhere.

204
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,613
Numbers, huh? That's true.

205
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,248
I didn't put much
thought into it myself,

206
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,784
but are you saying these things
are all working for someone?

207
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,053
Something like that, yes.

208
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,060
[VOICE]
Negative. Negative. Negative.

209
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,762
Hey guys, do you
hear those noises?

210
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,997
Huh?

211
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,298
Huh??

212
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:42,037
[VOICE] Negative.
Negative. Negative. Negative.

213
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,841
Loook!! It's the ghost!

214
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,593
[NEGATIVE GHOST] Negative.
Negative. Negative. Negative.

215
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:08,097
Loook!! It's the ghost!

216
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,934
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Negative. Negative. Negative.

217
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,903
[LUFFY] It did a dance
and split into three!

218
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,704
That's awesome!

219
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:18,707
Kind of annoying

220
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,676
how they keep saying
"negative" over and over.

221
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:23,212
I'm gonna catch it
and keep it as a pet!

222
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,053
Looks like it really
is a ghost, huh?

223
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,254
All right.

224
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,293
Fresh Fire!

225
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,728
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo.

226
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:43,566
Well, damn it.
Guess that didn't work.

227
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:47,202
I totally suck.

228
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:49,738
Everything I did this
week totally sucks.

229
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,107
Everything I've ever
done totally sucks.

230
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,176
I might as well
lie down and die.

231
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,744
[sobs]

232
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,747
They should make me
into a ceiling fan.

233
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:01,850
So your attack didn't work!
Don't be a baby!

234
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,152
Okay.

235
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,826
I wanna die and be
reincarnated as a clam.

236
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:15,731
I can't cut it as a human.
I'm useless. Just leave me here.

237
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:16,966
Get over it, already!

238
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,901
What the hell's wrong with you?

239
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,202
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo.

240
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:24,306
Negative. Negative.

241
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,407
[ROBIN] It would appear
that when the ghosts

242
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,977
pass through someone's body,
they become depressed.

243
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,712
And how does
that make any sense?

244
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,814
Ha! Those two are just
straight-up pathetic.

245
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,116
If they had even an
ounce of proper discipline,

246
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,884
they wouldn't let
themselves fall to pieces

247
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,021
over some measly little ghost
barely even touching them.

248
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,260
[ZORO] I'm not even
fit to be dog food.

249
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:48,731
Okay, I get it! What a pain.

250
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:52,101
Though it looks like Robin's
theory turned out to be spot on.

251
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,870
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Negative. Negative.

252
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:56,939
None of our attacks
can harm them,

253
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:58,173
but if they pass
through our bodies,

254
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,908
we'll be rendered helpless.

255
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,112
They might prove troublesome
if we have to fight them.

256
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,980
[SANJI] No kidding.

257
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:07,249
What a strange island.

258
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:10,185
[NEGATIVE GHOST]
Horo horo horo horo.

259
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,888
Negative. Negative.

260
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,760
Negative. Negative. Negative.

261
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,231
Arrrgh! You know what?
Screw you ghosts!

262
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:25,801
I don't wanna have you as a pet
anymore, I wanna crush you!

263
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,803
Whatever their
weak point is, I'll find it!

264
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,471
Just you wait!

265
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,206
Hahahaha!

266
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,841
I should call
you "dog food."

267
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,143
Shut up!

268
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:36,078
No wait, sorry.

269
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,180
You said you're not
fit to be dog food.

270
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:40,883
Hahahahaha!

271
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,830
The patchwork creatures
with the numbers on them

272
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:55,698
may look frightening,

273
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,965
but they seem easy
enough to defeat.

274
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:00,869
The ghosts, on the other hand,
seem to be exactly the opposite.

275
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:03,772
There was one of them
on the ship earlier.

276
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,340
They show up, then vanish.

277
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:07,443
It seems to me like
they're watching us.

278
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,245
If that's the case,
the question is,

279
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,980
who's pulling the strings?

280
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,196
[LUFFY] Hey, check it out!

281
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,332
It's a giant graveyard-- Cool!

282
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,835
Perfect place for a picnic,
don't you think?

283
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,437
No way! This atmosphere'll
ruin the taste!

284
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,272
What? Are you crazy?

285
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,275
Food is awesome. It never
tastes bad, anywhere!

286
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,944
[SANJI] Yeah, maybe not for you!

287
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,479
Anyway, let's get moving.

288
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,950
[growling]

289
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,251
[LUFFY] Hm?

290
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:08,237
Hey, don't put me back
in the ground, jackass!

291
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:14,576
It's an old man
with serious injuries.

292
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,579
Are you nuts?
It's a zombie!

293
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,449
Don't make fun of me!

294
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,898
[SANJI] Are zombies
usually this energetic?

295
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:39,268
I'll show you how dangerous
zombies can really be!

296
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,413
Oh, you guys
want a fight, huh?

297
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:54,383
Then I'll show you how
dangerous pirates can be!

298
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:20,993
[CREW] 600 Million
Berry Jackpot!

299
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:44,550
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

300
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,659
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

301
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,061
That's Dr. Hogback's
laugh, for sure!

302
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,663
Mm-hmm.

303
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,469
So is this the secret lab?

304
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,772
I sure hope it is!

305
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,877
[HOGBACK]
Fasfasfasfasfas!

306
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,580
My work is almost finished!

307
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,417
At last.
My beautiful marionette!

308
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,453
Fasfasfasfasfas!

309
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,790
Behold, Cindry!
This is a true work of art!

310
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,658
The work of a genius!

311
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,761
I hope the stupid thing blows up
and burns your face off.

312
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,065
Why would you even say that?
Cindry, please!

313
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,834
You make me anxious with
all those unnecessary and,

314
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,970
frankly hateful,
remarks of yours!

315
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,938
[CINDRY] I prepared a
midnight snack for you.

316
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,608
[HOGBACK] Oh! Wonderful!
What is it tonight?

317
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,610
[CINDRY] I call it
"spaghetti soup."

318
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,480
Wait, you're spilling
soup all over the place!

319
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,915
Be careful!

320
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,750
I wish every last plate
in the world would--

321
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,185
[HOGBACK] Yes, yes, I know.

322
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,020
But considering your
hatred for plates,

323
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,489
perhaps you should
choose a better menu.

324
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,424
How about
roast beef or turkey.

325
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,094
[NAMI] Cindry's here, too.

326
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,030
[HOGBACK]
Y'know, solid foods.

327
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,131
Did she really
die in an accident

328
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,667
like that newspaper
article said?

329
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,141
[NAMI] No, that can't be true.

330
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,809
[HOGBACK] What I'm saying
is lay off all the liquids!

331
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,111
[CINDRY] You won't
eat the spaghetti?

332
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,579
[HOGBACK] No, no, it's fine.

333
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,581
I'll eat it! It's too late now!

334
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,017
I'll lick it off
the table like always,

335
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,818
but licking off the
floor is a no-no! Okay?

336
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,053
[USOPP] What is
that thing, anyway?

337
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:28,854
[CHOPPER] It looks
like a human body.

338
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,789
Though judging
by those injuries,

339
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,824
he must be dead already.

340
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,793
He has a number on him, too,

341
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,628
just like the zombies
in the graveyard!

342
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,865
[NAMI] And Hogback said
he was "almost finished."

343
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,034
Well, I think that settles it.

344
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,535
What we're
about to see here

345
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,704
is the creation of a new zombie.

346
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,639
And that means that
Dr. Hogback made all

347
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,909
of the other undead creatures
on the island as well.

348
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,512
There's no other explanation.

349
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,013
Yeah, but even
if he's a genius,

350
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,916
it can't be that easy
to bring people back!

351
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,052
You saw! There were
tons of those things!

352
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,921
You don't think he made
all of them himself, do you?

353
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,690
Regardless of what we think--

354
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,557
we'll see for ourselves.

355
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,259
If there really
is some kinda' secret

356
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,827
to bringing the
dead back to life,

357
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,129
then this has
gotta be it, right?

358
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:33,585
[RYUMA] Nyohohoho!
Good evening!

359
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,754
What's the matter?

360
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,723
If you're going to
stand there and stare,

361
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,658
you might as well go inside.

362
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,726
"Yo ho ho ho?"

363
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,528
That isn't Brook, is it?

364
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,866
Nyohohoho!

365
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,803
Nyohohohoho!!

366
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,700
[ROBIN] Luffy, the
master of this island

367
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,201
is a very dangerous man.

368
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,770
[LUFFY] Oh yeah?
Do you know him?

369
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,005
[ROBIN] I do.
We'll have to be careful.

370
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,641
His bounty used to be
even higher than yours.

371
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,742
[LUFFY] "Used to be?"

372
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,010
[ROBIN] I'm afraid
we've stumbled

373
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,112
into something far
worse than I imagined.

374
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,781
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

375
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,115
"His Name is Moria!

376
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,818
The Great Shadow-Seizing
Pirate's Trap!"

377
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
