1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,338
Stop it, Saul!
You're scaring me!

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,507
Hope you're ready 'cause
if you make an enemy

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,712
outta me there's
gonna be hell to pay!

4
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,390
What's going on?

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,693
It's Vice Admiral Saul!

6
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:29,296
He ran away with Nico Olvia
and now he's attacking us!

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,398
He's lost his mind!

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,766
What's he doing on Ohara?

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,267
Hell if I know!

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,340
The whole island is done for!

11
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,708
They're gonna burn
it to the ground!

12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,343
Don't give up yet!

13
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:46,046
Even if the library burns,
we can still save the books!

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,382
Throw them out the window
and drop them in the lake!

15
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,685
They're better off wet than
burned to ash! Hurry up!

16
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,089
Fire!

17
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:03,264
Come back! Don't do this!
It's not like you!

18
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,299
Get all the books
out of the library!

19
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,167
Don't give up on a single book!

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,736
Don't give up on
a single sentence!

21
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:14,575
These words have been passed
on for thousands of years!

22
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,244
They must reach the future!

23
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,816
Robin! Get the heck outta here!

24
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,552
The evacuation ship's
gonna leave without you!

25
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,255
Don't worry about me, just run!

26
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,591
Mommy!

27
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,552
Shoot him down!

28
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,689
C'mon! Go! Get moving!

29
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,491
Don't you remember
what your mom told you?

30
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:22,162
You must live, Robin!

31
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,034
Attention evacuees,
the ship is leaving!

32
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,637
Wait! Someone's coming!

33
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,604
It's her!

34
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,074
Isn't that the monster girl?

35
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:34,775
Yeah, it is!

36
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,777
Go away! You're creepy!

37
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,479
Hey! Now's not
the time for that!

38
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,446
No wait!

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,448
That kid's mother Olvia
was in the newspaper

40
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,415
just the other day!

41
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,085
That means she's the
daughter of a criminal!

42
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,219
You're right!

43
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,122
If we let her on the ship,
it might cause us trouble!

44
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,056
Just leave her!

45
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,824
Don't be ridiculous!
She's just a child!

46
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,293
Hurry up and help her!

47
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,529
Everyone stop!
Don't let that brat on board!

48
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,663
Huh?

49
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,266
She may be a child, but
she's still an archaeologist.

50
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,435
That means she's a criminal
like the rest of them!

51
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,672
A little girl like that?
If you say so, Chief.

52
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,273
See? I told you!

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,475
Good thing we didn't let her on!

54
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,347
Robin! Must be CP9.
Damn! I'll show them!

55
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,116
Chief! Vice Admiral Saul
is coming this way!

56
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,050
Is that so?

57
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,552
Then there was no
need to question Olvia

58
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,787
about him after all!

59
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,222
Fire! Now! Shoot him down!

60
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:28,628
Ice Block! Partisan!

61
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,366
Saul!

62
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,509
It's Kuzan!

63
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,445
You.

64
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,248
My my my. This just won't do.

65
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,516
If we let a former marine
stop the Buster Call,

66
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,253
we'd look like damn fools.

67
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,622
Kuzan, wake up.

68
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,491
You can't tell me
this nonsense is justice!

69
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,159
Pull back! Now!

70
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,694
You know this ain't right!

71
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,731
They're just making
an example out of Ohara!

72
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,301
Come on. Please.
You're better than this.

73
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,404
If it's for the good of
the world, it has to be done.

74
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,106
You can't deny
that those scholars

75
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,141
are breaking the law, can you?

76
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,810
I won't criticize
your sense of justice.

77
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:17,811
There are as many rights

78
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,814
and wrongs as there are
viewpoints in the world.

79
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,784
However, if you insist
on getting in our way,

80
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,287
I can't sit back and do nothing.

81
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,564
The evacuation
ship was blown up!

82
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,199
Wha--what happened?

83
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,468
Looked like cannon fire!
From one of our ships!

84
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,137
It was Vice Admiral Sakazuki!

85
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,507
That idiot.

86
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,243
If we're doing this,
we have to be thorough.

87
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,146
If even one of those scholars
had managed to sneak onboard

88
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,415
that ship then all
the sacrifices

89
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,617
we made today
would be in vain.

90
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,821
However small, we cannot
allow any evil to thrive.

91
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,123
Is this what you call justice?

92
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,559
Can you take pride
in something like this?

93
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,393
We went too far.

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,462
I would never do
something like that!

95
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,598
We gotta run, Robin!

96
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,467
This fella's way too
strong for me to fight!

97
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,401
Saul is escaping!

98
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,070
He's taking one of
the scholars with him!

99
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,742
Ice Time Capsule!

100
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,415
Oh no! Saul, are you okay?

101
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,254
Robin, you gotta
get out of here.

102
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,360
Don't look back, just go!

103
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:42,096
If you stay on
this island, you'll die!

104
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,365
Take my raft and go out to sea!

105
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,633
But what about you?

106
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:51,205
He's got me, little lady. I'm
afraid this is the end. Hurry!

107
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,041
No! Everybody
I care about is here!

108
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,709
Now you listen to me.

109
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,812
You may be lonely at first.

110
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,016
But one day,
you'll find true friends.

111
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,587
True friends?

112
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,258
Yeah, the sea's a vast
place, so I guarantee--

113
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,729
someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

114
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,331
No matter who you are,

115
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:21,001
ain't no one born into
this world to be alone!

116
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,272
It's time to go, Robin.

117
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:29,543
This is goodbye! When things
are bad, do like I taught cha.

118
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,412
You remember the
laugh, don'tcha?

119
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,780
Look out! He's behind you!

120
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,450
Dereshishishishi!

121
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,318
Now. Ice Time.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,821
Saul, no!

123
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,257
Dereshishi...

124
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,627
Your friends are out there
at sea waiting for you, Robin.

125
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,629
All you gotta do is find them!

126
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,770
Share your life with them
and never let them go.

127
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,818
This is it. We're done for!

128
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:14,588
So this is the history
that mankind has chosen.

129
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,024
Shall we ever learn
the error of our ways?

130
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,562
Forgive me Robin.

131
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:26,700
I couldn't even leave you
with any parting words.

132
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,738
Neither as a scholar,
or a mother.

133
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,773
The Tree of Knowledge,
it's falling!

134
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,584
The concept of
"absolute justice"

135
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,787
can sometimes drive
a man to madness.

136
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,656
I've decided to let you escape.

137
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,225
I'm curious to see what
kind of flower will sprout

138
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,627
from the seed that
Saul protected.

139
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,861
You can bear a grudge against

140
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:59,366
whoever you like for this but
at least you're still alive.

141
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,537
However, I do suggest
you keep a low profile.

142
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,807
I've drawn a path for you
on the sea with my ice.

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,676
If you take the boat
and go straight ahead,

144
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,145
you'll reach land eventually.

145
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,548
Oh, one last thing.

146
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:19,353
I'm not your ally. If you do
cause any trouble,

147
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:22,756
I'll be the first
person to come after you.

148
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,092
My mom's here, can you help her?

149
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,061
No one will be saved.

150
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,530
If that pain is too
great for you to bear,

151
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,765
then you may join them.

152
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,735
This library is the
best in the world!

153
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,171
Do you like to read books?

154
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,406
Today is Robin's birthday!

155
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,710
Happy birthday
from us at the library!

156
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,378
Your mamma's a wonderful woman!

157
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,280
Ohara's a wonderful place!

158
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,749
And as surely as we
believe in the past,

159
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,752
we believe in the future
that you will inherit!

160
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:54,154
When you're feelin'
down, just laugh.

161
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,724
There ain't nothin'
a good laugh can't fix.

162
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,193
It seems awfully silly
to laugh when you're sad.

163
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,095
Don't knock it till you try it!

164
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,665
Dereshishishi! Dereshishishi!

165
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:15,209
Dereshishishi! Dereshishishi!

166
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,044
Dereshishishi! Dereshi,,,

167
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,123
Dereshishishi!

168
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:39,166
Dereshishishi! Dereshishishi!

169
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:49,175
Dereshishishi! Dereshishishi!

170
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,716
The sea's a vast place,

171
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,752
so I guarantee someday
you'll find friends

172
00:11:58,785 --> 00:11:59,786
who won't ever leave you!

173
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,117
Survivors? No, I don't think so.

174
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,053
Hey!

175
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:33,720
Huh?

176
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,056
Come here, look at the lake!

177
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,658
What? That's insane!

178
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,533
How did all of
those books get here?

179
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,203
It can't be a coincidence!

180
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,640
Yeah, this is her!
That's definitely the girl!

181
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,775
Where did you find her?
Is she captured?

182
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:58,078
No, we were told to keep
watch for a suspicious girl.

183
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,012
We eventually found her

184
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,048
on a passenger ship
Northeast of Ohara.

185
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,050
Unfortunately,
she knew what we were after,

186
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,786
so she slipped away
before we could catch her.

187
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,122
She's got the devil's luck.

188
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,724
Back then, I'm sure
I saw her leaving Ohara.

189
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,526
The island was burning to ash,

190
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,562
but she somehow made it out
alone on a little rowboat!

191
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,399
Of course, I tried to chase
her but all of a sudden,

192
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,735
the helm of our boat got
stuck like it was frozen in ice!

193
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:25,739
Either way, Saul probably helped
her escape before he died.

194
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,275
A scholar with the ability
to read the Poneglyphs

195
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,344
is dangerous no matter
how young she may be.

196
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,715
I don't care what
methods you use.

197
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,617
If we don't capture
her immediately,

198
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,086
then this entire mission
will have been for nothing!

199
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,259
79 million Berries?

200
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,662
Why does an eight-year-old
child have such a high bounty?

201
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,165
They said she's one
of the devils of Ohara.

202
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,434
You know, those scholars who
were plotting to end the world.

203
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,302
Really?

204
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,072
I heard she sank six
Marine battleships, too.

205
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,407
She must have some
kind of weird power.

206
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,776
Well, that explains the bounty.

207
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,211
The government forces
and Navy leaders

208
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,347
are searching for her, too!

209
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,315
She probably wants to
carry out the same plan

210
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,484
as the scholars
that were executed.

211
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,753
If she's out for revenge,
then no one is safe!

212
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,358
We can't let a child
of the devil run wild!

213
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,159
Such a kind girl.

214
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,628
Thank you for helping me out.

215
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,731
Sure! I'm grateful
for any work I can get.

216
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,799
By the way, before
we have our dinner

217
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,735
some men are here to see you.

218
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,238
Don't let her get away!

219
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,606
Now, give me my money!

220
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,175
I told you where she
was hiding, didn't I?

221
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,545
She may be small,
but she still works hard.

222
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:41,315
What's wrong?

223
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,549
Having trouble sleeping?

224
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,220
We have to get up early tomorrow
to go to work, so rest well.

225
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,554
'Kay.

226
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,523
She's sweet but if
we keep her around,

227
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,225
we could get in serious trouble.

228
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,194
Besides, just
look at this bounty!

229
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,330
Honey, she isn't in her room!

230
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,365
Damn it!

231
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,300
She must've
overheard us talking!

232
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:07,207
Dereshishishi!

233
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,477
You're hungry? Sorry. Me too.

234
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,053
Seems we're both
wanted by the law, Robin.

235
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,056
I know all about you.

236
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,358
Work for me and I'll make
sure you never go hungry.

237
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,062
Captain!

238
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,396
The Marines are after us!

239
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:30,731
Where did Robin go?

240
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,333
Hand her over, damn it!

241
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,635
Hurry! That girl is bad luck!

242
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,241
A devil like you
shouldn't even exist!

243
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:44,211
What? Nico Robin's here?
Where at?

244
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,312
Hunt her down!

245
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,047
Turn her in to the government!

246
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,788
I can't believe it. A Poneglyph.

247
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,789
Stay away!

248
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,759
I have nothing to
sell to the likes of you!

249
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,295
Look, I'm 16. I'll do anything.

250
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,697
Please, just allow
me to join your group.

251
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,333
You betrayed me, you damn witch!

252
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,203
Nico Robin.

253
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,538
I'd like you to assist me.

254
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,743
I've been told you
can read Poneglyphs.

255
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,052
If you trigger a Buster Call,
everything will be destroyed.

256
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,588
That includes
all of Enies Lobby,

257
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,161
and most likely you as well.

258
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,330
Nonsense! What're you saying?

259
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,199
They wouldn't
kill a VIP like me!

260
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,502
I'm not falling for your bluff!

261
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,539
20 years ago, everything
was taken from me.

262
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,775
And many innocent
lives were lost.

263
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:53,113
With one push of a button,
they summoned a terrible demon.

264
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,482
Now it rears its head again.

265
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,553
Aiming its sights on the friends
I've searched so hard to find.

266
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:02,289
The more that I wish
for us to be together,

267
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:06,794
the more my ugly fate
bares its fangs at you!

268
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,763
Even now, no matter
how far we sail,

269
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:13,167
there's an enemy that
haunts me at every turn!

270
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,404
Because I'm facing the world,
and all of its darkness.

271
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:21,075
First it was Aokiji,
and now CP9.

272
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,377
I've dragged you into
my troubles twice already!

273
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,314
If it goes on and on like this,

274
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,618
no matter how kind you may be,

275
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,786
someday, you'll
see me as a burden.

276
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,190
Someday you'll be forced to
betray me and throw me away!

277
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,158
That's what I'm most afraid of!

278
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:41,295
Understand? That's why
I didn't want you to rescue me!

279
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,397
If that's the only
future I have,

280
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,566
I'd rather die
to save me the pain!

281
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:51,639
Robin.

282
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:53,440
I never knew.

283
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,276
Robin.

284
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,446
I see. So that's it.

285
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,217
There you have it!

286
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,219
Yep! Right on the mark!

287
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,553
What a sorry case!

288
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,721
Even if you make friends,

289
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,657
all you can do is drag them
through the mud with you!

290
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:15,662
You can't win, pirates!
Look at this flag!

291
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:22,102
This symbol represents the
unity of over 170 nations.

292
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,639
A power that spans the
four seas and the Grand Line!

293
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,142
This is the world itself!

294
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,044
No matter how loud
your bark may be,

295
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,812
you can't stand up
to an enemy like that!

296
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,347
Just face it already!

297
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,216
Do you realize how
strong our organization is?

298
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:39,586
Do you realize how devoted
we are to capturing her?

299
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,195
If that's Robin's enemy,
then I know what to do.

300
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,430
Sniper King.

301
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,097
Hm?

302
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,834
Shoot down that flag.

303
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,435
Roger.

304
00:18:56,703 --> 00:19:01,141
This my new weapon, a massive
slingshot by the name of Kabuto!

305
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,611
Behold its awesome power!

306
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,447
Special Attack Firebird Star!

307
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,257
No way.

308
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,795
Mission complete.

309
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,800
Now they've done it!

310
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,901
Those idiots!

311
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,571
You can't fire on a
government flag! That's crazy!

312
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:37,278
Those pirates just declared war
against the World Government!

313
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,546
You're all going to die!

314
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,549
You morons can't challenge the
entire world and expect to win!

315
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,183
Yeah?

316
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:47,654
Bring it on!

317
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,334
Robin!

318
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,638
There's still something
I want to hear you say!

319
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:12,078
Tell me you want to live!

320
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:15,682
Robin.

321
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,421
Robin.

322
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,759
I can live?

323
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,726
Face it!

324
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,663
Your whole existence
is nothing but a crime!

325
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:31,632
The whole world's
against you Robin!

326
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,467
You can't be allowed to live!

327
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,171
I never dared to wish
for something like that.

328
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:44,311
The world had
denied me that hope.

329
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,381
I just want to die!

330
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:51,251
The sea's a vast place
so I guarantee--

331
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:56,089
someday you'll find friends
who won't ever leave you!

332
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:05,131
Believe in Luffy.

333
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,069
But now.

334
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:16,109
If I'm allowed to say my
wish--just this once. Then I--

335
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:21,782
I want to live!
Take me with you!

336
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:24,751
Take me away from here!

337
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,710
You guys!

338
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,013
You're so awesome--I love you!

339
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,382
Let's go!

340
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,430
When I was a kid,
I swore I'd gather a crew,

341
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,766
set out to sea,
and become a pirate.

342
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,168
A pirate, just like
the man who saved me.

343
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,203
And now, just as
he protected me,

344
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,239
I'll protect you, too, Robin!

345
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:27,341
You're one of us!
You're my friend!

346
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,276
I'm going to save
you no matter what!

347
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,244
Let's go!

348
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:32,246
On the next One Piece:

349
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,015
"Jump Towards The Falls!
Luffy's Feelings!"

350
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:37,617
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
