[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.454
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:45.598
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.003
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.819
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.624
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:02.899
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:08.409
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.885
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:20.568
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats formed
a pirate alliance with Law

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:23.106
and defeated
the Warlord, Doflamingo,

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:25.377
who had seized
control of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:29.351
Now, at last,
the kingdom is at peace.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.452
[REBECCA giggles]
Is that better?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.959

Yes. Your hand is very warm.

Three days have passed

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.622
since the battle ended
between the Straw Hats

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:23.426
and the Don Quixote Family.

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:33.446
[SENGOKU groans]
We finally made it!

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:41.563
[TSURU] Is Straw Hat Luffy still
hiding out in this kingdom?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.838
Yes. That's for certain.
He's wounded.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.743
[TSURU]
I see.

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.178
[MARINE A]
We've stationed a lookout unit

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:51.416
at every port in Dressrosa.

00:04:51.483 --> 00:04:53.353
Trust me, it'll be
impossible for him

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.560
or his crew to sneak past us.

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:59.198
Our camp is in that direction.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:01.102
[TSURU]
Get moving, girls.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.505
[MARINES]
Right!

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:05.477
You're all fired up, eh, Tsuru?

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:07.949
[TSURU]
Quiet down. Let's go!

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.571
[SENGOKU]
Issho! There you are!

00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:21.543
I heard about
your spat with Sakazuki!

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:25.518
[SENGOKU laughs] Glad I'm not
Fleet Admiral anymore!

00:05:25.584 --> 00:05:27.655
Oh, shut it! Just eat.

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:31.596
There's not much else for you
to do as Inspector General.

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.134
[TSURU]
Admiral Fujitora.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.139
Why haven't you
seized that pirate?

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:40.079
You've confirmed that he's here.
So what's the holdup?

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.689
Straw Hat Luffy,
the hero of Dressrosa.

00:05:44.756 --> 00:05:48.897
Since he's a wanted man,
should I bring him in?

00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:52.539
Or let him walk,
because he saved this kingdom?

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:56.646
The decision weighs
heavily on my mind.

00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:58.015
Huh?

00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.624
[SENGOKU]
Hm? A die?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.529
[laughs]

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:07.067
[TSURU]
This is no laughing matter!

00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:11.910
[chuckles] A die.

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.046
[SENGOKU chuckles]

00:06:13.113 --> 00:06:14.983
[TSURU]
That's quite enough!

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.452
Uh, sorry!

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:20.561
Fool. And you! What is this?

00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:22.832
For Straw Hat and his cohorts,

00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:27.407
I decided to let providence
choose their fate.

00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:30.948
But. I wonder...

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.754
[FUJITORA]
If Straw Hat's an ordinary man,

00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.860
would providence spare him
two days in a row?

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:41.937
Today's the third day and I
haven't cheated a single time.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:45.945
[sighs]

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:48.249
You. Soba, now.

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:50.688
Yes. Coming right up, sir!

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:52.525

I appreciate your help with

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:54.963
transporting the Heavenly Demon,

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.670
but this island is still
under my jurisdiction.

00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:04.048
[FUJITORA]
So, I'll handle things my way.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.417
Fine by me.

00:07:05.484 --> 00:07:08.356
But the Navy can't just
let him run amok forever.

00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:10.460
Not with that bounty!

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.966
[MANSHERRY]
Will you be Dande-donors?

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:14.570
Navy officers, please.

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.107
Help us! We need you!

00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:19.812
Ah. You're back again, huh?

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:20.981
Yes, sir!

00:07:21.048 --> 00:07:23.687
Well, aren't you adorable?

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:28.998
A Dwarf, they call you?

[MARINES]
Aw!

00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:34.543
I'm Mansherry.
I'm from the Tontatta tribe!

00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:37.748
[MARINE A]
Aww! How cute!

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:43.492
Ooh. That's interesting.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.165
[SENGOKU gasps]
Hey! What was that?

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.369
You'd better show some respect!

00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:50.841
This is the daughter of
the great Chief Tonta!

00:07:50.908 --> 00:07:53.780
Which means you're
meeting a princess!

00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:56.286
Now, bow! Bow before her!

00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:58.423
Wait, Mouji. It's fine.

00:07:58.489 --> 00:08:01.362
Ah, she's so merciful!

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:02.932
You see, truthfully,

00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:05.103
our people aren't supposed to
let ourselves be seen

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.277
by anyone in Dressrosa who isn't
a member of the royal family.

00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:11.148
So I was hoping
I'd be able to heal

00:08:11.215 --> 00:08:13.053
everyone's injuries discreetly.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.256
Really? How's that work?

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:16.993

Rebecca! Rebecca!

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:28.784
It's time she put on her dress.

00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.988
Where could that girl be?

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:36.733
[REBECCA]
But. I don't understand.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.273
Why would he tell
that outlandish lie?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.945
[DOLDO]
That's what Kyros wants.

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:48.791
[TOWNSPEOPLE chattering]

00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.327
[TOWNSMAN A]
The time has come!

00:08:50.394 --> 00:08:52.565
[TOWNSMAN B] Yeah, I've been
waiting for this day forever!

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.767
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
So have I!

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:56.238
Take it away, Gyats,
we're ready!

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:58.043
[TOWNSPEOPLE]
Yeah, say it!

00:08:58.109 --> 00:08:59.612
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.616
Thank you all for being here!

00:09:01.683 --> 00:09:05.356
Now, this day is one that
will go down in history!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.370
Because, as you know,
our king is returning to power!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheer]

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.849
That's right!
After an entire decade,

00:09:17.916 --> 00:09:20.988
our King Riku the Third is back!

00:09:21.055 --> 00:09:24.128
So give it up
for him, Dressrosa!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:33.880
[ALL] King Riku!
King Riku! King Riku...

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.838
[ELIZABELLO]
This kingdom is mad.

00:09:45.905 --> 00:09:50.013
That pirate fooled them,
made them hate you.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.187
They allowed themselves to be
seduced by wealth and violence.

00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:56.759
Only when they experienced
the fear of death

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:58.664
did they finally
come to their senses

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:02.237
and wish for this land
to be peaceful.

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:06.412
It's a farce, but I can't laugh.

00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:08.483
Of course you can't!

00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:12.190
Even so, I'm happy
they're safe now.

00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:16.499
Though I wonder
if I'll be able to

00:10:16.566 --> 00:10:19.104
make them happy as well.

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:38.375
Were I a god,
I'd prevent any danger.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:40.915
Nothing would
harm them. Nothing!

00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:45.256
What? Now you sound
like you've gone mad!

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:47.093
Just a thought.

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:50.801
[DOLDO]
We'll continue our efforts.

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:53.807
After all, what more can we do?

00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:58.048
[ELIZABELLO]
Indeed.

00:10:58.884 --> 00:11:04.194
Besides, the day will come when
Rebecca inherits the crown.

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:14.214
Yes, of course.
Does that thought scare you?

00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:15.350
[DOLDO]
Hm?

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:18.657
You know, back when
Scarlet was a young girl,

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:21.596
she was quite the firecracker!

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:24.234
What if Rebecca leaves, as well?

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:27.073
What are you saying?

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.906
There. You're all set, dear.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:44.207
[SERVANT B]
How lovely!

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:45.912
[SERVANT A] A dress suits you
much better than

00:11:45.978 --> 00:11:47.748
that old armor of yours!

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.050
You think?

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:52.357
[SERVANT B] Yes! You're
beautiful, Lady Rebecca!

00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:53.459
Thank you.

00:11:53.527 --> 00:11:55.130
You know, when you
wear that dress,

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:58.903
I swear you look
exactly like your mother!

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.874
That's true!

00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:02.679
Oh, and we've heard talk
about your father, too!

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.247
[gasps]

00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:07.387
He was a prince from
some faraway land!

00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:09.157
And rumor has it,

00:12:09.224 --> 00:12:11.829
that prince and
your mother eloped!

00:12:11.896 --> 00:12:13.499
After that,
King Riku had no choice

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:16.973
but to tell everyone that
Lady Scarlet was dead.

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:21.415
[SERVANT C] It's like something
from a romance novel!

00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:24.020
[SERVANT B]
It makes me swoon!

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.112
He was a prince? From where?

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:38.950
Not sure, but from
the rumors I've heard,

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:42.357
it's a luxurious kingdom
with beautiful lakes.

00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:46.032
Apparently, his land
was at war back then.

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.002
So she and this guy ran off,

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:51.209
and after that,
baby Rebecca was born!

00:12:51.275 --> 00:12:53.279
Yeah?

00:12:53.346 --> 00:12:56.451
But then, the prince
was killed in the war.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:58.422
Isn't that just terrible?

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.795
So Lady Scarlet and Rebecca--

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.899
I mean, Lady Rebecca,

00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:05.871
ended up living
undercover in Dressrosa.

00:13:05.938 --> 00:13:08.175
[TOWNSMAN F] That's crazy.
Her dad was a prince,

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:11.583
so her blood's still
a hundred percent noble!

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.218
What a bizarre rumor!

00:13:13.285 --> 00:13:14.822
We know for certain
that Sir Kyros

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:17.294
is the maiden's father,
do we not?

00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.233
I am at a loss.
Here, have some lettuce!

Ugh.

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:56.005
[REBECCA]
My mother told me I should never

00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:58.175
hurt others no matter what!

00:13:58.242 --> 00:14:00.046
[KYROS]
To let you know I'm around,

00:14:00.112 --> 00:14:01.984
I'll drop a flower petal
through the crack

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.889
in the window every morning.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.769
[TOWNSMAN G]
All right!

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.071
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:51.550
[KIN'EMON] They're distributing
Lady Mansherry's

00:14:51.617 --> 00:14:53.252
medicinal flowers!

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:57.293
They're wonderous!
And proving to be very useful!

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.799
[MARINE C]
Get in line. Wait your turn.

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:01.235
[MARINE D]
One per person.

00:15:01.302 --> 00:15:04.074
Thank you! This medicine
is incredible!

00:15:04.141 --> 00:15:07.380
It heals injuries up,
lickity-split!

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:10.486
[MARINE D]
Here.

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:12.356
[TOWNSBOY A]
Thank you!

00:15:13.927 --> 00:15:15.898
[TOWNSBOY A]]
Look, Dad! I got you one!

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:18.603
Thanks, son. Let's try it out!

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:27.353
[TOWNSBOY A]
Wow, gone in a flash!

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.489
It's like magic.

00:15:28.557 --> 00:15:32.598
[TOWNSMAN I chuckles]
How lucky am I?

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:33.967
Huh?

00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:39.646
[KIN'EMON] I knew they would
increase their numbers!

00:15:39.712 --> 00:15:41.282
Fly swiftly, Spring Sparrow!

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:43.953
We mustn't let them see us!

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:02.692
Here.

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:03.993
Right!

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:08.035
Thank you so much, sir!

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:09.338
For sure!

00:16:09.404 --> 00:16:11.742
[SENGOKU] I see. So you're
able to use "donors"

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:13.680
to enhance your
healing capability.

00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:17.486
The power of the Heal-Heal Fruit
really is something else!

00:16:17.554 --> 00:16:20.126
Say. I'd be glad to
donate as well!

00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:21.896
In fact, go ahead
and take enough

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:23.867
to patch up ten wounded people.

00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:26.238
Wow. That's generous of you!

00:16:26.304 --> 00:16:28.944
That's nothing! I'll do 15!

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.213
You'll what?

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.483
In that case,
I'll give you enough for 20!

00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:34.689
Put me down for 25!

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:37.393
Fine! Then make it a hundred!

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.736
[chuckles] That's a bit much,
but thank you all!

00:16:46.613 --> 00:16:48.148
It's time.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:51.789
I'll let you have the honor
of rolling the dice today.

00:16:56.633 --> 00:17:00.239
If it's anything
but one, then we move.

00:17:00.306 --> 00:17:04.047
We'll go after Straw Hat
and Law immediately.

00:17:14.034 --> 00:17:16.371
[KIN'EMON]
Apologies for the delay!

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.513
[snoring]

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.417
[LUFFY]
Food?

00:17:22.484 --> 00:17:24.154
Ha?

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.060
[gasps] You're not
sleep-eating, are you?

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:29.632
The Navy could bust down
that door anytime.

00:17:29.698 --> 00:17:31.167
Let's eat while we can.

00:17:31.234 --> 00:17:32.572
[FRANKY]
Uh-huh.

00:17:32.638 --> 00:17:34.173
Okay!

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.725
[KIN'EMON]
Indeed! They carried on and on

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:44.729
about Lady Rebecca's father.

00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:45.998
I believe they were suggesting

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:49.070
he was a prince from
some foreign land, yes?

00:17:49.137 --> 00:17:50.674
[KANJURO]
Verily!

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:55.517
[LUFFY]
What? That's a strange story!

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:56.485
[LUFFY snores]

00:17:56.553 --> 00:18:00.660
[LUFFY]
And I'm sad 'cause Sabo's gone!

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:06.304
[LUFFY] We gotta hurry and catch
up with Sanji's group, too!

00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:11.181
You can't be hungry,
and angry, and crying,

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:13.687
and sleepy at
the same time, Luffy!

00:18:13.754 --> 00:18:15.591
Make up your mind!

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:19.899
Yeah, but that old soldier dude
is Rebecca's real dad!

00:18:19.966 --> 00:18:22.137
You haven't fully recovered yet!

00:18:22.204 --> 00:18:25.510
Stop stuffing your face
and lie down!

00:18:26.645 --> 00:18:30.185
[LUFFY] Who would make up
some dumb crap like that?

00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:34.127
He's right, it's stupid.
Makes no sense.

00:18:34.194 --> 00:18:36.431
That's what they said? For sure?

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:39.171
[KIN'EMON] Of course!
These ears don't lie.

00:18:39.237 --> 00:18:41.809
[KANJURO]
Yes, upon my honor!

00:18:50.493 --> 00:18:53.700
[KYROS] I was the person
who got that rumor started.

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:54.935
[ALL]
Huh?

00:18:59.812 --> 00:19:01.481
[KYROS] The only ones
who know the truth

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:03.553
are some of the royal family,

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.727
and those of the Don Quixote
Family who dug into my past.

00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:12.269
The kingdom knows her mother,
but little more than that.

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:18.482
[KYROS] I spread that story
before they could find out

00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:21.187
that Rebecca is my daughter.

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:23.693
But why?

00:19:25.296 --> 00:19:28.903
It's because of my past.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.976
I was a criminal,
and someone of my low breeding

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:35.182
could never marry royalty.

00:19:35.249 --> 00:19:41.128
This is... better for her.

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:42.598
[LUFFY]
No it isn't!

00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:45.937
Does Rebecca know
about all this stuff?

00:19:47.808 --> 00:19:50.212
She must've read my note.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:53.619
I told her the honest truth
about my whole life.

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:56.525
[KYROS]
Because of what I did,

00:19:56.592 --> 00:20:00.099
Rebecca suffered
for a long time.

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.972
I want her to live in
the light forever.

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:07.013
And that means she can't have
anything to do with me!

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.850
It's the only way
I can make amends

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.254
for failing as her father.

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:13.526
When you leave this place,

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:16.364
I'm thinking of
leaving, as well.

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:21.074
[KYROS] She may resent my
choice, but she's still a child,

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:22.611
and I won't let her
life be ruined

00:20:22.678 --> 00:20:24.782
over a temporary fit of emotion!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:27.921
King Riku understands
and agrees with me.

00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:39.343
[ZORO, USOPP] Well, we know
how Luffy feels about it.

00:20:40.446 --> 00:20:43.653
[BARTOLOMEO panting]

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.128
[ringing]

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:49.765
What now?

00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:53.372
[LEO]
Captain! Uh, I mean, Sir Kyros!

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:55.042
It's me, Leo!

00:20:55.108 --> 00:20:57.446
Mister Zoro!

00:20:58.315 --> 00:21:00.620
Mister Luffy, I didn't
know you was awake,

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:01.756
what an honor!

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.593
How's your morning?

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:13.445
[gasps] Five Straw Hat Pirates
in the same place?

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.817
I'm too weak! Have mercy!

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:19.692
It's like a laser beam of
awesomeness is burning my eyes!

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.729
Aw, man, if I ever
saw your whole crew

00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:24.602
of all-stars at the same time,
I don't know what I would do!

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:26.706
I'd probably
piss myself and die!

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:29.778
Would you please just say
what you came here to say?

00:21:29.845 --> 00:21:30.947
Right, sorry!

00:21:31.014 --> 00:21:33.519
There's been some movement
over at the Navy tent!

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:36.258
I think they might
come this way!

00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:38.162
Vice Admiral Tsuru's with them!

00:21:38.228 --> 00:21:41.101
And the old fleet
admiral Sengoku, too!

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:42.704
Tsuru and Sengoku?

00:21:42.771 --> 00:21:45.744
Why'd they send in a
couple of big guns like them?

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.046
Oh no!

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:48.550
[LAW]
Sengoku.

00:21:48.617 --> 00:21:50.887
Leo. Why were you calling me?

00:21:50.954 --> 00:21:54.795
Oh! The Navy's getting
ready to attack you!

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:03.478
[FUJITORA] So, it's a six, then.
This is providence!

00:22:03.546 --> 00:22:05.415
All troops, advance!

00:22:05.482 --> 00:22:09.190
Find the Straw Hats and Law,
and then capture them!

00:22:09.257 --> 00:22:12.698
Also, arrest every criminal
that's within the palace.

00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:14.502
Let's bring all of them down!

00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:16.337
[MARINES]
Sir!

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:22.050
[MARINES yell]

00:22:22.116 --> 00:22:25.489
Admiral! We can't invade!
You need clearance!

00:22:25.557 --> 00:22:27.661
[FUJITORA] You do your job
and I'll do mine!

00:22:27.728 --> 00:22:30.099
I'll take full responsibility!

00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:31.569
[MARINE H]
Roger!

00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:53.078
[USOPP screams]

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:16.157
[NARRATOR] In an effort
to save the Straw Hats

00:23:16.224 --> 00:23:18.228
from being penned in
by the Navy,

00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:19.999
the skilled fighters
from the Colosseum

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.636
launch a daring escape plan.

00:23:21.703 --> 00:23:25.009
Meanwhile, Luffy makes a run for
the Royal Palace on his own,

00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:28.516
stirring up a commotion that
plunges the kingdom of Dressrosa

00:23:28.583 --> 00:23:30.118
back into chaos!

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:31.722
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:35.229
"A State of Emergency!
Rebecca is Kidnapped!"

00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:38.435
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
