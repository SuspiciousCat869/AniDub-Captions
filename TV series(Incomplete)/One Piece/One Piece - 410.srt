1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,449
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:41,085
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,389
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:47,325
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:48,159
Monkey D. Luffy,

42
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,094
a boy whose
body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,696
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,632
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,502
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

46
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:59,170
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,672
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:04,008
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:07,612
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,815
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:14,085
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:18,623
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

53
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:24,495
[NARRATOR] Luffy was sent flying
from the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:27,265
by Bartholomew Kuma.

55
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:29,400
After soaring
through the sky for hours,

56
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:33,171
he found himself in a kingdom
inhabited entirely by women.

57
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:35,640
Its name was Amazon Lily.

58
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:39,544
[LUFFY] Everyone Falls in Love!

59
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,512
Pirate Empress Hancock!

60
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:54,392
[LUFFY struggling]

61
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,329
Sorry I can't pay you back
for saving my life and stuff,

62
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,499
but I got places to go and
a crew that's waiting for me.

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,202
And that means
bye-bye lady land.

64
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:07,572
[MARGARET]
Men truly are mysterious.

65
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,708
Their arms stretch,
they grow fat without warning,

66
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:14,112
their chests are flat, and
between their legs they have--

67
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:16,648
Hate to ask you
for your help again,

68
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:18,249
but could you
take these off for me?

69
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:19,284
[MARGARET] Your family jewels?

70
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:20,852
Would you drop it?

71
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,487
I mean these things!

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,789
I said I was going to
see my friends, remember?

73
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,859
If I show up looking like this,
they're all gonna laugh at me!

74
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,462
I think they look nice,
but I suppose.

75
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:33,865
[MARGARET] There.

76
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,333
[LUFFY] Hey, thanks lady!

77
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:36,601
You're the best!

78
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,204
[MARGARET] I can't
imagine anyone hating frills.

79
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,473
You men are just too strange.

80
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:44,676
Yeah? Well...
Whatever you say.

81
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,145
Either way,
thanks for taking them off.

82
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,247
Okay. Bye for real this time.

83
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,615
I gotta hurry.

84
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,483
[MARGARET]
Are all men so hasty?

85
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,223
[LUFFY] I can't rest 'til I know
my friends survived like I did.

86
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,625
That's all that matters.

87
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:04,696
'Cause as long as they're alive,

88
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:07,365
we can get back up
and keep fighting!

89
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:17,775
I'm gonna get stronger
than all those guys!

90
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,712
[yelling]

91
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:21,779
[LUFFY] Let's do this!

92
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:24,649
I'll walk all the way back
to Sabaody on my hands!

93
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,617
That'll toughen me up for sure!

94
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,824
[LUFFY]
Think you could give me a ship?

95
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,793
[MARGARET]
Wow. You really are hasty.

96
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:39,497
[LUFFY] You don't have any
ships? We're in a Calm Belt?

97
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,565
[MARGARET] That's right.

98
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,334
This island lies in an
area known as a Calm Belt.

99
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:46,704
And it's surrounded
by a giant Den of Sea Kings.

100
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,439
That's another reason
sailors never dare

101
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,841
to come near this place.

102
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:52,243
Castaways do sometimes
make their way to our shores,

103
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,612
but they almost always
do so as corpses.

104
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,880
Wait, but you said your leader

105
00:05:55,913 --> 00:05:57,782
was part of a
pirate crew, right?

106
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,684
The ship of our
Snake Princess, the Yuda,

107
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,986
is pulled by two
giant poisonous sea snakes,

108
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,789
so even Sea Kings
don't dare to attack it.

109
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,358
And it's the only ship
on Amazon Lily.

110
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,864
This sucks. And there's no wind.

111
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,700
Should I just build a raft
and paddle all the way there?

112
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,237
[MARGARET] That's a joke, right?

113
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,371
Hey!

114
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:21,739
I'll just build a raft
and paddle all the way there!

115
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,474
Wait, you weren't joking?

116
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:31,382
Yeah! It's done!

117
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,317
[MARGARET]
But it's already falling apart!

118
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:37,989
[LUFFY yelling]

119
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,990
What's wrong?

120
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,592
He said he was a pirate,
but he can't even swim?

121
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,478
[LUFFY coughing]

122
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:05,283
I had no obligation to save you.

123
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:07,885
Do all men sink like a rock
even if they're sailors?

124
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,758
That was close!

125
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,462
Damn it!
If only Franky was here!

126
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:18,830
I'm screwed!

127
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,265
[MARGARET] You're not
the only one with problems!

128
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:23,534
Why did you have to cling to me

129
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,446
when you should've
been running away from here?

130
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:50,578
If this keeps up much longer,

131
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,680
I'll end up
growing attached to you!

132
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,449
Hold on! Just stop!

133
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,054
[LUFFY]
Why do you wanna shoot me?

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,668
You know...

135
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,537
Come to think of it,
these arrows are crazy strong.

136
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:17,905
When those girls
were chasing me earlier,

137
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,108
they were busting up
stone walls with those things.

138
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:22,643
Doesn't look like
there's anything special

139
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,679
about them, though.

140
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,547
Well, of course
these arrows are strong.

141
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:28,382
They're imbued with our haki.

142
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,817
You're mocking me, aren't you?

143
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:33,454
Haki? I never heard of it.

144
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:34,789
[YAMABUKI] There she is!

145
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:36,390
Margaret, are you safe?

146
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,360
You made it!

147
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,129
The man's with her!
Strike him down!

148
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:42,830
[LUFFY]
Uh-oh!

149
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:43,931
[KIKYO]
Coward!

150
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:47,835
[MARGARET] Come back!

151
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,503
[SWEETPEA] Forgive me if
you were injured, Margaret,

152
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,405
but our situation is quite dire.

153
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,373
The Snake Princess has returned,

154
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,109
so we must vanquish
this fiend post haste!

155
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:12,159
You're quite bold
to lay your anchor

156
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:15,897
in Sea King-infested waters...
Unless you're just fools.

157
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:22,536
[MOMONGA] Yes. We did notice
the Sea Kings, thank you.

158
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,171
The Sea Prism Stone
on this battleship

159
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:27,541
may conceal our presence
from the beasts for a while.

160
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,443
But after waiting here
for so long,

161
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,812
they eventually caught on
and attacked us.

162
00:09:31,846 --> 00:09:34,548
We would prefer
to avoid such encounters,

163
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:35,650
but as you know,

164
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,119
the agreement between
the Kuja and the government

165
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:40,821
forbids us from getting
closer than three kilometers

166
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:42,723
from your island.

167
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:43,891
So, like "fools",

168
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,660
here we are waiting
in a monster's nest

169
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,729
while you ladies
take your sweet time.

170
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,597
Hey, have you heard?

171
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,132
They say that
the ruler of the Kuja

172
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:53,668
is a monster that
can turn people to stone!

173
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,069
That's stupid!

174
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:56,504
You killed that Sea King?

175
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,606
Well, you can
color me impressed.

176
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,609
[MARINES muttering]

177
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,244
Those of us who
travel on the Grand Line

178
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:05,813
are no strangers
to these creatures.

179
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,214
But the ones
here in the Calm Belt

180
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,818
are certainly larger
and decidedly more ferocious.

181
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,528
[MOMONGA]
Any sign of the Kuja ship?

182
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,830
Uh, no, not yet, Vice-Admiral!

183
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:25,166
No approaching ships
anywhere in sight!

184
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,503
[MOMONGA] How long does
she intend to keep us waiting?

185
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,973
Or perhaps the empress
has changed her mind.

186
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:44,185
[MARINE 410B]
It's a Sea King!

187
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,654
[MARINE 410C]
Fire! Fire!

188
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,697
No way!

189
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,833
Our cannons didn't even
leave a mark on that thing!

190
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:01,635
[MARINES]
Ahh!

191
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,306
The whole ship's
gonna be smashed to pieces

192
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,041
if we don't do something quick!

193
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,043
Yeah, but what can we do?

194
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,178
We gave it all we had!

195
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,716
[SEA KING screeching]

196
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,152
That thing isn't gonna
eat the whole ship, is it?

197
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,923
I had hoped for a
greeting from the empress,

198
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:24,225
not this monster.

199
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,961
However, I shall
meet it all the same!

200
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:42,877
[SEA KING choking]

201
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,054
Look, guys!

202
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,288
He's alive!

203
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,058
[MOMONGA]
Monster though it may be,

204
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,728
if I allowed that beast
to devour a Marine vessel,

205
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,664
how could I call
myself a Vice-Admiral?

206
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:07,735
[MARINES cheering]

207
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,174
What strange marks.

208
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,176
Did you cut from
the inside of its stomach?

209
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,312
[MOMONGA] I am not here to hunt
Sea Kings or to chat about them.

210
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,847
Let us conduct
our business quickly

211
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,782
so that I may
leave these waters.

212
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,721
[RAN] Your words
are as sharp as your blade.

213
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,625
Then hear them well,
Kuja Pirates.

214
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,894
I tire of waiting here.

215
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:37,998
I am Vice-Admiral Momonga
of Navy Headquarters!

216
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:41,936
Warlord of the Sea and
Pirate Empress Boa Hancock.

217
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,639
I have come for you!
Reveal yourself!

218
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:48,275
The Snake Princess does not
cater to your beck and call.

219
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,045
There's your answer.
You might as well go home now!

220
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:52,413
Look at those ugly men!

221
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,115
Unsophisticated boors!

222
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,317
I haven't seen a
live one in a long time!

223
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,786
Whenever pirates or
merchants see the Kuja flag

224
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,322
flying above the island,
they flee in terror!

225
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:02,656
[laughing]

226
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,725
That laugh isn't very lady-like.

227
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:06,660
We received a message
from your princess.

228
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,729
She claimed that she
would reply to our summons,

229
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,365
but now it appears
she was not quite sincere.

230
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,401
[MOMONGA] This morning's paper.

231
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:16,137
A place and date
has been decided

232
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,706
for the public execution
of Portgas D. Ace,

233
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,275
the 2nd Division Commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates!

234
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,878
There is no turning back now!

235
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,880
[MOMONGA] The World Government
has issued strict orders

236
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:28,182
that the Seven Warlords
of the Sea assemble.

237
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,985
Refuse and our
agreement will become void.

238
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,955
And your princess' title
as Warlord will be revoked.

239
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:36,757
Think about that for a moment.

240
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,325
Until now,
you have done as you pleased

241
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,827
because of your position.

242
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,730
But if you are unwilling
to grant us this favor,

243
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:45,799
you will be reduced to
nothing but ordinary pirates.

244
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,301
Which means
you'll be adversaries

245
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:50,237
of the Marines and
World Government alike.

246
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:54,108
Do you hear me? Boa Hancock!

247
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:09,690
[footsteps approaching]

248
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:17,982
[footsteps approaching]

249
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:34,698
[footsteps continue]

250
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,384
[KITTEN meows]

251
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,419
[HANCOCK] Which one of you...

252
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,988
...had the audacity...

253
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,691
...to place this
kitten in my path?

254
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:04,862
My deepest apologies, empress!

255
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,997
I accept full responsibility!

256
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,799
[HANCOCK]
You should be more careful.

257
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,434
Yes. Of course!

258
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,468
Stop it!

259
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,938
At long last. Boa Hancock!

260
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:29,453
Careful men, keep your guard up!

261
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:30,554
The Vice-Admiral is right.

262
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:31,989
I'm still not
convinced those women

263
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,325
aren't really
monsters in disguise!

264
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,459
There's no telling
how frightening

265
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:36,493
their leader could be!

266
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:37,795
Brace yourselves!

267
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:48,939
[MARINE 410F]
That's the Pirate Empress?

268
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:51,542
[MARINE 410G] She's the most
beautiful woman in the world!

269
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,627
Crap! Crap! Crap!

270
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,799
Halt, man! Face me!

271
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,736
Ah jeez, the girls from
this island are scary as heck!

272
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,372
I'll take Nami
over them any day!

273
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,812
Well, maybe not.

274
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,881
[LUFFY yelling]

275
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:34,918
[LUFFY] One hit from those
crazy arrows, and I'm done for!

276
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,522
All right, here goes!

277
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,700
This fiend behaves
more like a monkey

278
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:50,901
than a human man.

279
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,636
Damn it,
what are we going to do?

280
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,505
We cannot allow
him to run free here,

281
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:55,973
not with the empress coming.

282
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,808
We have no choice
but to hunt him down

283
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:00,611
and kill him
as quickly as possible!

284
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,546
Our time is short.
We must split up!

285
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,580
[KIKYO] Very well!

286
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:05,649
May your arrows find
their target, my sisters!

287
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:06,817
[ALL] They shall!

288
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:10,487
[LUFFY] Maybe it's not
a good idea to go this way.

289
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,191
I mean, this is where
I was running away from before.

290
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,292
It'll work out.

291
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,861
I can always run back
to the jungle if I have to.

292
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,196
[YAMABUKI] Up there!

293
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,431
Oh no!

294
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,466
I won't miss
my mark this time!

295
00:17:24,101 --> 00:17:25,969
[LUFFY yelling]

296
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,439
Is he dead?

297
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:29,473
Not yet.

298
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,508
The man just slipped
and fell into the jungle.

299
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,092
So you've come for me at last.

300
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,796
Stubborn and meddlesome, I see.

301
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:55,666
[HANCOCK] I shall be frank.

302
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,569
I have no intention
of keeping my promise.

303
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:01,605
In other words,
I refuse to go to war for you.

304
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,876
Still, I rather like
my position as a Warlord.

305
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,945
So I think I shall keep it.

306
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:12,649
Also...

307
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,751
You shall give me
all the cargo on your ship,

308
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:16,453
quickly, without complaint.

309
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,789
[MOMONGA] That's enough!

310
00:18:18,822 --> 00:18:21,892
I won't stand for you
acting like a spoiled child!

311
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,660
Do you honestly
think we'll accept

312
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,662
such unreasonable demands?

313
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:31,568
[MARINE 410C]
Haul it over, men!

314
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:33,670
I'll do anything you want!

315
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,239
Order me around some more!

316
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:37,040
Put that cargo
down this instant

317
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,109
or I'll throw you overboard!

318
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,211
Sorry!
I couldn't resist her, sir!

319
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,183
[MOMONGA] Portgas D. Ace's
public execution

320
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:49,119
will be exactly
one week from today!

321
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:52,055
The event will be held in
the town square of Marineford.

322
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,157
In other words,

323
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,859
we're doing this inside
of Navy Headquarters itself.

324
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,528
[MOMONGA] There is
no doubt that Whitebeard

325
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,063
will attempt to rescue him
in the next few days.

326
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,267
Likely with the strength
of his entire crew behind him.

327
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,636
Under the leadership
of three admirals,

328
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:08,005
and with the aid of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea,

329
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:11,808
Navy Headquarters is determined
to stop him at any cost.

330
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:15,812
Will you give up the title of
Warlord, or accept your orders?

331
00:19:15,846 --> 00:19:17,114
Make your decision quickly.

332
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:19,249
You've kept us
waiting long enough!

333
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,829
[HANCOCK] I already told you,
I like being a warlord.

334
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:35,933
However, I loathe
the World Government.

335
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,702
I have no interest
in following their orders.

336
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,071
Surely I can find
a better solution.

337
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,942
Oh, I know--
How does this sound?

338
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,712
"The Marines who came to escort
me had a mysterious accident.

339
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:49,646
When they were discovered,

340
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,715
they had all been
transformed into stone

341
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:54,351
and were promptly disposed of."

342
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:55,819
She's planning to do something!

343
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:57,087
Don't let your guard down!

344
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,289
I've heard about
Hancock doing this before!

345
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,625
A merchant ship was
attacked by the Kuja Pirates,

346
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,926
and when it was
discovered later,

347
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,795
there weren't any
crew members onboard.

348
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,863
Just a bunch of weird statues!

349
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,169
[SAILOR 410A]
Hey! Look at that!

350
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:15,205
[SAILOR 410B] Those aren't...
people, are they?

351
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,276
You mean they
were all turned to stone?

352
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:22,546
I've had enough
of these threats.

353
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:26,283
Your temper tantrums will not
be tolerated, do you hear me?

354
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:27,851
[SANDERSONIA giggles]

355
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,320
Our big sister has
a rotten personality.

356
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,889
But in the end,
she always gets her way.

357
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:36,593
[MARIGOLD] Indeed. And there
is a very good reason for that.

358
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,201
[HANCOCK]
Would you like to know why?

359
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:47,170
Because no matter what I do.

360
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,239
Even if I kick a kitten.

361
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:51,308
Even if I yank off your ears.

362
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,076
[growls]

363
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,078
[HANCOCK] Why, even
if I were to commit murder,

364
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:56,713
the world would forgive me.

365
00:20:56,747 --> 00:21:00,284
And that is because... yes.

366
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,953
It is because
I am beautiful!

367
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,691
[screaming]

368
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,126
[AMAZONS] Your highness!

369
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,194
[MARINE 410K] You're right!

370
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,064
You can abuse me all
you want, your highness!

371
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,899
Stop that, you fools!

372
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:25,942
[HANCOCK] The guilty thoughts
swimming in your hearts

373
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:28,979
shall turn your flesh to stone!

374
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,818
Love-Love Beam!

375
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,656
Hancock!

376
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:52,769
Oh, I'd expect no less
from a Navy vice-admiral.

377
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:53,937
[HANCOCK] Clever.

378
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,841
Forcing the wicked thoughts
from your mind with pain.

379
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:00,444
I do applaud your conviction.

380
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:01,411
Though...

381
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,182
I can't extend that
compliment to your men.

382
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:07,918
They should be ashamed.

383
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,920
[HANCOCK]
Now you're the only one left.

384
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,990
[MOMONGA] But one...

385
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,158
...is not...

386
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:16,226
...zero.

387
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:38,882
[AMAZONS laughing]

388
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:42,085
We shall return to our
peaceful home of Amazon Lily!

389
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,020
Aye-Aye, Snake Princess!

390
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,059
[MOMONGA]
Listen up, Boa Hancock!

391
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,360
I won't turn away!

392
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,896
I refuse to return empty-handed!

393
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,399
Unless you reappear
in two days...

394
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,835
Your position will be revoked!

395
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:08,345
[HANCOCK] Do as you wish.

396
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:16,186
[NARRATOR]
Luffy storms the Kuja village

397
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:18,021
in hopes of acquiring a boat,

398
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,956
but accidentally lands in a bath

399
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,058
where Empress Hancock
is bathing.

400
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:25,462
As he peers through the steam
rising from its waters,

401
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:29,032
he sees a forbidden secret
etched upon her back.

402
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:30,534
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

403
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,369
The Secret Hidden on the Backs!

404
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,504
Luffy and the
Snake Princess Meet!

405
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,007
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
