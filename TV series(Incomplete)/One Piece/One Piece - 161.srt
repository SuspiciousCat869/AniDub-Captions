00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:43,450
[GOLD ROGER] The world.
What a glorious place!

2
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:48,830
Seek freedom and it will lie
stretched out before your eyes.

3
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:53,335
If the endless dream guides
your restless spirit, seize it!

4
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:57,005
Raise your flag, and stand tall!

5
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:01,968
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)</i>

6
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,055
<i>I think back to the time</i>
<i>when my search first began--</i>

7
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,432
<i>I left behind those</i>
<i>shores of sand--</i>

8
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:12,062
<i>For the endless,</i>
<i>everlasting world out there...</i>

9
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:15,023
<i>I know that with this</i>
<i>burning passion driving me--</i>

10
00:01:15,106 --> 00:01:17,233
<i>Someday, somewhere,</i>
<i>I'll finally--</i>

11
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:25,533
<i>See the light I have searched</i>
<i>for everywhere (ere-ere!)</i>

12
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,036
<i>When the summer sun is shining,</i>

13
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,663
<i>shaking the sails</i>
<i>of my heart, I know...</i>

14
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:35,585
<i>(Fly away glum blue sea)</i>

15
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,088
<i>A brand-new world</i>
<i>that had been hiding</i>

16
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,715
<i>has opened up its</i>
<i>doors for me to go...</i>

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,136
<i>(Fly away glum blue sky)</i>

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,681
<i>Swaying in the troubled waves--</i>

19
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:50,141
<i>From all despair,</i>
<i>I can be saved--</i>

20
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,436
<i>For the horizon</i>
<i>on the other side is--</i>

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,689
<i>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</i>

22
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,816
<i>Is what I aim for!</i>

23
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,860
<i>And though I've traveled far</i>
<i>from where my search began--</i>

24
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:03,363
<i>Over seas of green</i>
<i>and shores of sand--</i>

25
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:08,076

29
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:32,183
Hey guys. Look at this.

30
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:33,435
It's dirt.

31
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,686
Huh?

32
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,229
Oh, right! I almost forgot.

33
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,565
I noticed that the first
time I saw this island.

34
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,984
So why's this island
different from the others?

35
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:44,029
[ROBIN] At any rate, it's reason
enough to start exploring.

36
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,282
The Ordeal of Spheres.

37
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:51,077
There's a 10% survival
rate, so good luck.

38
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,038
You boys had better
catch her pretty soon.

39
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,956
She's getting away!

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,458
He's right. We need
to get moving now

41
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,293
before we lose sight of her.

42
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm gonna take
care of ball guy.

43
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:04,716
[SANJI]
Don't do anything reckless.

44
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,217
He has weird powers.

45
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,345
Back as soon as we get the boat!

46
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:09,763
[LUFFY]
Great.

47
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,515

00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,081
[USOPP] I can't see
anything from down here!

58
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:37,540
[SANJI]
Watch yourself, Luffy.

59
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,959
These priests are
far from ordinary.

60
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,838
Now to find the boat and get
the hell out of here, fast!

Ha! Ha, ha!

64
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:59,062
Oh, good.

65
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,023
Looks like this one will be
sticking around a while.

00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:16,496
[SATORI laughing]

68
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,793
Now, where did those
others scamper off to?

69
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:25,755
I'll be oh so disappointed
if they got away.

70
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,634
Hmm. There we are.

74
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,070
There she is!

75
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,363
Wanna tell me where?

76
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:51,614
[USOPP]
Straight ahead!

77
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,659
Climb up the--one, two--
third tree on the right!

78
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:57,120
You can jump on when
she passes beneath you!

00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,506
Behold! My latest invention!

180
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,968
"Usopp"-- [yells]

181
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,303
[SANJI]
Yeah... what?

182
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,263
Heh. Just watch!

183
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,558
[USOPP]
Ah. There's the Crow!

184
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,519
Milky Road, straight ahead!

185
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,230
[USOPP]
Perfect.

186
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,315
Here we go! Line out!

187
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:23,988
[USOPP grunts]

188
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,160
[SATORI]
Hm? Now what are they up to?

189
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,748
[USOPP grunts]

190
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:37,460
Yes. Now I just have to swing
over there and catch the Crow!

191
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,713
But my timing's gotta
be absolutely perfect!

192
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,047
If I miss it, that's it!

193
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,800
We've only got one shot at this!

194
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:45,593
Ahh. Not bad.

195
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,595
But how're you gonna
get past those spheres?

196
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,431
Just let me worry about that.

197
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,224
Did I happen to mention
they also call me

198
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,892
"King of the Jungle"? Heh.

199
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,602
Here goes.

200
00:10:54,686 --> 00:11:01,484
Usopp--! [yells]

201
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:17,834
Here goes.

202
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:22,339
Usopp--! [yells]

203
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:24,632
Yeah! Ha, ha!

204
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,177
It works! Ha, ha!

205
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:33,266
[USOPP yelling]

206
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:41,816
Ha! That's it, Usopp!

207
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,611
Now just drop straight
down! You can't miss!

208
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:50,158
[SANJI gasps]

209
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:50,992
[SATORI]
Huh?

210
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:57,082
[USOPP grumbling, grunting]

211
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,336
Dammit! Just jump!

212
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,422
Yeah, um... about that.

213
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,341
Just one small problem.

214
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,760
I forgot the rope is sort
of attached to the belt.

215
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:11,054
I never really got around
to fixing that part.

216
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:12,806
Throw me some scissors
or somethin'.

217
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:18,395
[USOPP yells]

218
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:21,606
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!
Crap! Crap! Crap!

219
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:27,320
Crap! Crap, crap, crap--[whines]

220
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:35,286
[USOPP whining]

221
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,955
[LUFFY]
Yoohoo! Hey, Usopp!

222
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:39,290
What do you think?
This is a lot of fun, isn't it?

223
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,627
[LUFFY laughs, yells]

224
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:45,630
I think I need to have a
little word with those two.

225
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,883
[thudding]

226
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,726
Here's the deal.

227
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,020
I'm gonna forget about
what just happened.

228
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:02,022
But now you do what I say.

229
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:03,732
Right. I'm sorry.

230
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:06,109
Yeah, me, too. What he said.

231
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,527
Okay then.

232
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,739
First thing, we're gonna
forget about the boat for now.

233
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:14,159
Then we're gonna all charge
that fat freak at once.

234
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,202
I don't care what
kinda powers he's got.

235
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,621
With all three of us
attacking at the same time,

236
00:13:18,705 --> 00:13:20,582
if there's a way to
beat him, we'll find it.

237
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,625
[SATORI]
Oh? Don't be so sure!

238
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:23,835
[gasps]

239
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,510
Where did he go?

240
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:41,061
[SATORI yells]

241
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:44,898
Heh, heh.

242
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,693
[SATORI]
Impact!

243
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,028
[SANJI groans]

244
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,073
[BOTH]
Sanji!

245
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,873
[SATORI]
Ha, ha, ha!

246
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:05,126
Like they say, "Life is pain."

247
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,338
Now, who wants to go next?

248
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,311
[NAMI]
Huh?

249
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,231
[NAMI]
Thanks.

250
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,404
[gasps]

251
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:26,124
[NAMI pants]

252
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,542
Huh?

253
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,295
Hey, uh, did something
just move over there?

254
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:31,463
I don't know.

255
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:35,508
Oh. Um, then did you
see anything, Robin?

256
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:38,303
Nope, sorry. Can't say I did.

257
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:40,680
[ZORO] You sure it wasn't
a monkey or somethin'?

258
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:42,307
[NAMI]
A monkey?

259
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,434
Yeah. I guess.

260
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,227
[ROBIN]
So, what do you think?

261
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,104
Maybe we should check
out the other shore.

262
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,356
[NAMI]
Forget it! I told you,

263
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,566
I'm not getting attacked
by those sharks again!

264
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,860
[ZORO]
Oh, here we go again!

265
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,869
[CHOPPER]
I don't think I can get near it.

266
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:06,122
But I promised Zoro I'd fix
the ship while he was gone.

267
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,750
So, I have to give it my best!

268
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,796
Just don't let them see you.

269
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,882
Gently. Gently.

270
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,760
Nice and easy.

271
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,261
That's it.

272
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,852
Got it!

273
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,855
Now I can fix the
ship like promised!

274
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,399
[bird squawks]

275
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:37,987
[screaming]

276
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,236
[CHOPPER screaming]

277
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,491
[panting]

278
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,535
Oh, yeah, the whistle!

279
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,208
[GAN FALL]
This is the One Whistle!

280
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:35,045
It is yours to use
as you see fit!

281
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,424
[GAN FALL] Should you
find yourselves in danger,

282
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:42,010
you have but to blow it and
I will come to your aid!

283
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,721
As I said, normally, I would
charge you five million extol,

284
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,515
but for today, please accept
this as my gift to you!

285
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,685
But wait! We still
don't know your name!

286
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,396
I am Gan Fall.

287
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,357
And this is my partner, Pierre!

288
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,193
[squawks]

289
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:03,073
[GAN FALL] May luck be
with you, brave warriors!

290
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,868
Yeah. Where are we
supposed to go from here?

291
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,497
[LUFFY] I know! Let's call the
old man back and ask him!

292
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,831
Don't even think
about it, Luffy!

293
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,750
You don't blow that whistle
to ask for directions!

294
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,585
It's supposed to be
for emergencies only!

295
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,712
Yeah! What if that guerilla
guy who attacked us

296
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,755
comes back again?

297
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,548
You wanna get blown up?

298
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,843
Fine. Tell you what.

299
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,304
Just to be safe,
I'll hold on to the whistle.

300
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,264
Any objections?

301
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,725
[ALL grunt]

302
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,060
What is with you people?

303
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,812
C'mon, I'm clearly
the weakest one here.

304
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:35,230
I need it more than you do!

305
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:36,398
--But--
--But nothing!

306
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,274
It's the only thing
that makes sense!

307
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:39,401
I wanna blow it!

308
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,069
No! Forget it, Luffy!

309
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,987
If we give it to you,
you're just gonna waste it!

310
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,406
It's not a toy!

311
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,117
Oh, come on! I wanna call
that weird old guy again!

312
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,451
No. Let me have it!

313
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:50,495
I'm the weakest one here,
I should hold it!

314
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:51,538
You wish!

315
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,498
I'm the weakest,
and you all know it!

316
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:55,583
Oh, please!
How can you say that?

317
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,836
I'm just a poor,
defenseless girl!

318
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,213
No way! I'm weakest,
and I'm smallest!

319
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,173
Hey! I can be
pretty damn helpless

320
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:03,550
when I put my mind to it!

321
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,135
No fair! It's not my fault...

322
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:08,221
Fighting over who's
most pathetic. Odd.

323
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,768
[NAMI] Okay! Here's how
we're gonna do this!

324
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,978
Center of the ship!

325
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,188
We leave the whistle
on the main mast here,

326
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:18,690
so if any of us
gets into trouble,

327
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:20,775
all we have to do is run
over here and blow it.

328
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,277
Now it's fair to everyone.

329
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,111
Fine.

330
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,654
[CHOPPER]
Okay.

331
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,156
And, last thing.

332
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,532
None of you are
allowed to blow it

333
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,492
under any circumstances. Got it?

334
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:32,162
Aw. Can't I just
call him one time?

335
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:33,455
You touch this whistle,

336
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,123
and you'll be swimming
with the sky fish!

337
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,709
[ZORO, LUFFY, ROBIN, SANJI]
Fine. We got it.

338
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,757
There, good.

339
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,051
I'm sure glad this
thing was still here.

340
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,761
Now if anything
really bad happens,

341
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:50,180
the Sky Knight
will come save me!

342
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:53,558
But, I can only blow
it as a last resort!

343
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:55,435
[CHOPPER]
Hear that?

344
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,020
Anyone wants to take this ship,

345
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:59,439
they have to get
through me first!

346
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:11,868
[CHOPPER gasps]
What's that?

347
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,882
Just one?

348
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,677
Surely you're not the only
sacrifice I get to kill?

349
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,512
[gasps]

350
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,396
[whistle blows]

351
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:44,943
[ROBIN]
Cobblestones.

352
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:50,657
[ROBIN] We may find more clues
if we see where these lead.

353
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,659
[whistle blows]

354
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:53,910
Hey. You hear that?

355
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:56,121
What do you guys think that was?

356
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:58,790
[ZORO]
Quiet.

357
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,709
[ZORO]
Don't move.

358
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,502
Huh? [gasps]

359
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,598
[ZORO]
I've had enough!

360
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:20,937
[ZORO sighs]

361
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,150
[ROBIN]
What a day, huh?

362
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,360
Try to be more careful.

363
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:30,030
Yeah, uh, sure. Thanks.

364
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,243
[SATORI yells]

365
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:36,661
[USOPP groans]

366
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,999
Usopp!

367
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,501
[SATORI grunts]

368
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:46,796
[gasps]

369
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,176
[LUFFY groans]

370
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,502
[SATORI]
Ha, ha, ha!

371
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:38,932
<i>Even if, there are times</i>
<i>when we are far apart</i>

372
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Through it all, remember</i>
<i>I'll be there in your heart</i>

373
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,316
<i>And on days when</i>
<i>you start to cry</i>

374
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,069
<i>You know you'll always have</i>

375
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:54,948
<i>Someone who's there at your side</i>

376
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>To wipe all the tears away</i>

377
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,915
<i>We will never yield</i>

378
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:05,792
<i>We won't back down</i>

379
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,087
<i>We'll keep our dreams alive</i>

380
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:15,593
<i>They'll never change</i>
<i>the way we feel inside</i>

381
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,055
<i>And the light that</i>
<i>shines eternally</i>

382
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,475
<i>So many tried to grasp</i>

383
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:30,358
<i>Will someday be held</i>
<i>within our hands at last</i>

384
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,539
[LUFFY] Guess we're really
in trouble this time, huh?

385
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,875
[SANJI] Yeah, it's just been
one thing after another!

386
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,586
[LUFFY] So, sorry, Chopper!
We can't help you!

387
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,588
[CHOPPER] What? You mean
I'm all on my own?

388
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,756
[SANJI]
Relax. You already called

389
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,466
that crazy old guy, right?

390
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:56,259
[CHOPPER]
Huh? Oh, yeah!

391
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:58,345
The Sky Knight will save me!

392
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,013
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

393
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:04,309
"Chopper in Danger!
Former God vs. Priest Shura!"

394
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:06,811
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
