<i>confuses me</i>

353
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,720
<i>I cannot understand</i>

354
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,789
<i>As I face what I must do</i>

355
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,592
<i>I'll say goodbye</i>
<i>and squeeze your hand</i>

356
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,394
<i>I'll set sail alone</i>

357
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,630
<i>But always know</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep you near</i>

358
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,399
<i>As I drift away</i>

359
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,969
<i>I pray you watch me</i>
<i>as I disappear</i>

360
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,842
<i>As I watch the sunrise</i>

361
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,412
<i>I began to wonder</i>

362
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:38,116
<i>What could be the reason</i>
<i>It's so hot inside</i>

363
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,585
<i>No answer has come</i>

364
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,656
<i>But I can't get away</i>
<i>from what's true</i>

365
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:49,528
<i>It's because of you</i>

366
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,763
<i>Show me how to</i>
<i>catch those feelings</i>

367
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,433
<i>Get 'em to come back to me</i>

368
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,934
<i>I'll do what I must</i>

369
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,337
<i>Because they're</i>
<i>everything I wanna be</i>

370
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,506
<i>Wrap these arms around my dreams</i>

371
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,009
<i>And pull 'em back from yesterday</i>

372
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,511
<i>If I'm holding hands with you</i>

373
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,347
<i>I'm sure that we can</i>
<i>make the way♪</i>

374
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,557
[LUFFY] So this is the city
where Gold Roger,

375
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,525
King of the Pirates, died!

376
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,060
[SANJI] This place
is filled with great food

377
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,028
and beautiful girls!

378
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,863
[USOPP] Think they got
anything on sale?!

379
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:25,964
[SANJI]
What are you, a housewife?

380
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,966
[LUFFY] I'm gonna find out
where they kill people.

381
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,534
[ZORO]
I want some swords, but...

382
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,869
[NAMI]
Do you have money?

383
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,538
[NAMI] I can lend you some
at 300% interest!

384
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,073
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

385
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,008
"The Town of
the Beginning and End!

386
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,844
Landfall at Logue Town!"

387
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,046
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
