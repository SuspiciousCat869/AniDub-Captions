WEBVTT

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.154
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.631
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.036
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.409
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:53.313
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.518
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:58.758
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:02.933
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.570
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:08.343
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.752
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.094
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat one of the

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:18.731
Four Emperors of the New World,

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.735
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.308
and launched an attack
on Doflamingo in Dressrosa.

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:27.515
[NARRATOR] In response,
Doflamingo trapped the kingdom

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:31.122
inside a barrier and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.359
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:35.464
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:37.468
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.541
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:45.518
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Zoro closes in on Pica

00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.889
who intends to murder King Riku.

00:03:48.022 --> 00:03:51.864
Commodore...

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:56.540
Killer... Bowling!

00:03:59.546 --> 00:04:03.086
Nine mountains and
eight seas make one world!

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.861
[ZORO] One thousand worlds
make one chiliocosm!

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:09.600
One chiliocosm
to the power of three

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:12.437
and there's nothin' I can't cut!

00:04:15.143 --> 00:04:18.382
[ZORO] Three-Sword
Style Secret Technique!

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:26.933
The Billion-fold World...
Trichiliocosm!

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:37.622
[PICA yells]

00:04:37.755 --> 00:04:40.060
[ZORO]
Nine mountains and eight seas,

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:41.663
there's nothing I can't cut!

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:43.734
[PICA]
Rot in hell!

00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:46.573
[ZORO]
Three Thousand Worlds!

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:54.322
[screams] Oh crap!
His remains are still fallin'!

00:04:54.455 --> 00:05:00.634
All right! King Punch!

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.654
That settles that.

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.806
[LUFFY] "So Long!
Bellamy's Farewell Blow!"

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:51.971
[MIHAWK] Have you ever
shattered your blade before?

00:05:52.104 --> 00:05:53.439
Yeah.

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:57.548
It's happened a couple of times.

00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:59.619
Cracked a few of 'em
fighting you.

00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:02.390
Infused with Haki,
those swords would have

00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:04.095
been able to
withstand the stress.

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:05.464
[ZORO]
Hm?

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.572
[MIHAWK] You must carry
every nick as a mark of shame.

00:06:09.706 --> 00:06:12.578
Any sword can become
a Black Blade.

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:14.381
A Black Blade?

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:17.053
Until you master this,
no liquor.

00:06:17.187 --> 00:06:18.790
[ZORO]
Huh?!

00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:20.995
[laughs]

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:45.844
No nicks on the edge.

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:49.786
[chuckles]

00:06:52.023 --> 00:06:55.764
[USOPP]
Zoro! Zoro, you okay, buddy?

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:56.967
Heh.

00:06:58.336 --> 00:07:00.039
Of course.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.905
[FUJITORA] Were there
any casualties reported?

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:18.678
[MARINE A] No sir.
All thanks to your help.

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:25.189
All right! King Punch!

00:07:33.173 --> 00:07:35.209
[TOWNSMAN A]
The rubble's falling!

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:36.412
[TOWNSMAN B]
Get outta here!

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:38.115
[TOWNSMAN C]
Run!

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:49.606
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:53.880
[MARINES gasping]

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:07.909
Admiral Issho.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.414
Quickly, evacuate the civilians.

00:08:10.548 --> 00:08:11.717
[MARINE B]
Yes, sir!

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:12.652
[MARINE C]
Run!

00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:14.421
Vacate this area!

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:16.527
[MARINE D]
Go, go, go!

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.705
[TOWNSPEOPLE yelling]

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:27.915
[MARINE E]
Everyone! Seek shelter!

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.167
[MARINE B] Admiral!
The citizens have vacated!

00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:38.703
Good work.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:56.940
[MARINE A] Your quick thinking
saved a lot of lives today.

00:08:57.074 --> 00:09:00.013
Suspending gravity on the
falling debris was brilliant.

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:02.117
[MARINE F] Luckily, we had
time to react since we had

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.655
a lot of the evacuees
gathered here.

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:06.926
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.429
[TOWNSMAN G]
Did you see?

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.834
The giant statue
was split into two!

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:14.341
[TOWNSMAN H] Does that mean one
of the Executives was defeated?

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:17.280
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE A]
Lord Pica was taken out!

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.953
I can't believe someone
with power like that

00:09:20.086 --> 00:09:21.724
didn't enter the tournament.

00:09:21.857 --> 00:09:23.359
Must be a humble guy.

00:09:23.492 --> 00:09:27.034
And he's a mere subordinate
to Garp's grandson.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.706
[ORLUMBUS chuckles]
Gotta hand it to him.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.208
King Riku has been saved

00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:34.782
so I suppose I'll
let him slide this once.

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:40.393
[cries] Mister Zoro!

00:09:40.528 --> 00:09:42.130
That was some feat!

00:09:42.264 --> 00:09:43.733
It's over.

00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.480
[TOWNSMAN I gasps]
That's the factory!

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:53.621
[TOWNSMAN J] Something caused
it to burst into flames!

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:55.289
[TOWNSMAN K]
How'd that happen?

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:03.440
We ready for one more?

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:07.247
[DWARVES]
Let's go! Alley-oop!

00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:13.125
[DWARVES]
All right!

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:16.332
[DWARF A] Burn it to
the ground! It made us suffer!

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:20.373
That'll be the last time some
jerk tricks us into slavery!

00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:30.861
[TREBOL] Hey, hey. Looks like
Pica was taken down

00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:33.600
and now the factory's
been set on fire, Doffy.

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:35.838
[laughs]

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.643
But what they don't
quite realize yet

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:43.152
is our defeated can revive,
and our factory can be repaired.

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:46.660
That's because we still
have Mansherry on our side

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.397
with the Heal-Heal Fruit power!

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:52.805
[laughs]

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:07.233
[LEO]
Rebecca! Robiland! Are you okay?

00:11:10.675 --> 00:11:11.809
Huh?

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:20.827
[LEO gasps] Wait. Is that
really you, Commander Kyros?

00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:24.201
Yes. You've rescued
the princess, I see.

00:11:24.334 --> 00:11:27.708
[LEO] You look so valiant!
Even more than the statue!

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:29.579
[KYROS chuckles]
You flatter me.

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:31.081
Huh?

00:11:31.214 --> 00:11:33.286
My goodness, you've been
terribly injured!

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.724
Please allow me
to heal you at once!

00:11:35.857 --> 00:11:37.628
[KYROS]
One moment.

00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:40.066
So, you're Princess Mansherry.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:42.972
I've heard word of
your remarkable ability.

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:44.976
But there must be
a limit on its use.

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:47.380
Do not waste it on me.

00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:48.918
But you're wounded!

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.055
Just let me help you!

00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:53.694
[KYROS] I'll be fine.
I'm conscious, aren't I?

00:11:53.828 --> 00:11:55.430
More importantly, you're safe.

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:57.801
It must have been hard on you.

00:11:59.371 --> 00:12:01.475
[KYROS] If you're set on
using your power to help,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.379
there are going to be
countless citizens

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:05.851
who need you more than I.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.324
[MANSHERRY gasps]
Oh no!

00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:30.133
This is really our home?

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.236
Leo mentioned that
the situation was dire,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.343
but I didn't expect
something like this.

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:38.584
At least we successfully
destroyed the factory.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.988
The final clash is upon us.

00:12:41.122 --> 00:12:42.457
Yeah, they pulled it off!

00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:45.263
I knew we could count on Inhel!

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.767
[KYROS]
The kingdom has long suffered

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.737
under Doflamingo's clutches.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.612
It shall either be liberated
and returned to King Riku

00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:55.784
or once again fall into despair.

00:12:58.524 --> 00:13:03.466
[KYROS] Our last line of hope
lies among a pirate crew now.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.136
Is that so?

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:13.185
[KYROS]
Our fate shall be decided...

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:18.162
[KYROS]
...at the Royal Palace!

00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:26.780
Save us, Lawland, Luffyland.

00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:30.386
This is it. It's all on them.

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.927
Luffy. Traffy.

00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:35.597
Go, Lucy.

00:14:33.445 --> 00:14:36.653
Okay, I infiltrated
the Rampart Tower.

00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:39.592
Things are looking
dicey in here, though.

00:14:39.725 --> 00:14:42.097
Can you make it to me, Sabo?

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.567
[SABO] I'm helping some of
the trapped prisoners

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.038
escape the coliseum grounds.

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:48.276
Sorry, but you're
way too far from me.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.979
I know for a fact you've handled

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:52.016
much tougher missions
than this, Koala.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.589
[KOALA] I wouldn't call
if this was a cake walk!

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.826
Luffy might be at risk, too!

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:57.995
Be right there.

00:14:58.128 --> 00:14:59.532
[KOALA]
Rude!

00:15:14.862 --> 00:15:17.634
[USOPP]
Zoro! You good?

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:24.616
Hey, Zoro! Do ya need a hand?

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:27.453
[ZORO]
I'm fine! Not even a scratch.

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:29.324
That's my boy!

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:41.047
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:58.449
I was scared!
I thought you might die!

00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:01.489
Actually, I was more afraid
that I might die, so thank you!

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:03.961
Sir Zoro, splendid
work back there!

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:05.631
Yeah, thank you Mr. Pirate!

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.835
I can't believe you cut down
that massive statue

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:08.837
with just swords.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.607
That was crazy!

00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:13.814
Hold the applause, guys.

00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:15.617
We're not in the clear just yet.

00:16:15.751 --> 00:16:18.523
Once that cage is gone,
then you can cheer.

00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.727
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasp]

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.287
As long as that stands,

00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:37.460
the main thorn in our side
is still out there.

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:04.214
[LUFFY]
Stop! That's enough, Bellamy!

00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:06.586
Cut the crap!

00:17:28.563 --> 00:17:31.836
[LUFFY]
Bellamy! Answer me.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.109
Why do this to yourself? Why?

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.382
Hey! Y'know you're being used!

00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:41.088
Mingo's just a jerk!

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:44.762
He said you're free,
take it and walk!

00:17:44.896 --> 00:17:47.968
[DOFLAMINGO]
Fine, Bellamy. I've had my fun.

00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:50.473
You're free from me now.

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:53.680
Just like you've
always been, right?

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.720
You can just go,
why risk your life?

00:17:56.853 --> 00:17:58.690
Listen to me, Bellamy!

00:18:01.763 --> 00:18:05.269
[LUFFY] He knew you'd do this,
and he doesn't care!

00:18:06.037 --> 00:18:10.780
[BELLAMY chuckles]
That may be true, but so what?

00:18:10.914 --> 00:18:13.953
I ain't gonna turn my back
on him even if I croak!

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:17.027
If that's what it takes
to get him to respect me,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.163
then I'm gonna do it!

00:18:19.297 --> 00:18:23.372
You big liar!
This isn't about loyalty!

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:25.744
It's about your pride!

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.252
If you have it all figured out,

00:18:30.386 --> 00:18:32.390
then shut up
and fight me already!

00:18:32.525 --> 00:18:34.294
You'll die for nothing!

00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:35.597
[BELLAMY gasps]

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:41.474
[BELLAMY] This is the
end of the road for me.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:44.849
[BELLAMY]
No, this is what I want.

00:18:44.982 --> 00:18:47.286
To be killed...

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:51.261
...by the only other man
I ever respected.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.293
[BELLAMY]
Straw Hat.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:44.968
[bell tolls]

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:50.279
[SARQUISS]
Where are you going?

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:52.818
Up there.

00:19:57.494 --> 00:19:59.397
Bellamy did change!

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.034
You take that back now!

00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:03.239
You have changed, Bellamy.

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:05.275
You're my friend!

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.452
[BELLAMY]
Thank you, Straw Hat.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.231
[BELLAMY]
Straw Hat!

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:19.037
Fine. If you won't
take me seriously,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.276
then I have no other choice!

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.948
Don't think I won't kill you!

00:20:26.418 --> 00:20:28.656
I'm not playing around here!

00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:39.611
Why are you just standing
there staring at me?

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:43.018
Where's the old
Straw Hat I remember?

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:44.487
Stop being such a coward!

00:20:44.622 --> 00:20:47.426
Put your dukes up already!

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:52.269
This is it, one final blow
and it's all over!

00:20:57.914 --> 00:20:59.417
[LUFFY]
Mingo!

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:02.423
Are you looking down on me?

00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:04.661
Go to hell!

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.709
One last chance
to do this, Straw Hat!

00:21:13.078 --> 00:21:14.515
[BELLAMY]
Thank you.

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.821
Thank you for
calling me a friend.

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:52.323
[panting]

00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:57.935
[BELLAMY]
I know I'm pitiful!

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.273
I know I looked up
to the wrong man!

00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:02.944
I don't need to
hear it from you!

00:22:07.787 --> 00:22:09.892
[BELLAMY]
I have to hold on to something!

00:22:10.025 --> 00:22:13.699
Even a loser like me
has some dignity!

00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:26.692
[LUFFY yelling]

00:22:27.627 --> 00:22:32.069
Doflamingo!

00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:39.652
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:22:39.785 --> 00:22:43.358
I can hear the howling
of a wild cur.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.400
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why don't you limp on up here?

00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:51.007
Hey, Law,
your buddy's on his way.

00:22:51.141 --> 00:22:53.613
This is going to be good.

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:56.652
I'm sure he'll be
surprised to see you.

00:22:56.786 --> 00:22:59.423
Or rather, your corpse.

00:23:14.153 --> 00:23:15.524
[NARRATOR]
Even on the brink of death,

00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:17.894
Law seeks to avenge Corazon.

00:23:18.028 --> 00:23:21.100
He taunts Doflamingo,
landing him in a worse position.

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:23.138
Luffy, finally arriving
on the scene,

00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:26.612
becomes distraught after
seeing Law's lifeless body.

00:23:26.746 --> 00:23:30.352
Enraged, he starts the
final clash with Doflamingo!

00:23:30.485 --> 00:23:32.023
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.156 --> 00:23:35.664
"Law Dies!
Luffy's Raging Onslaught!"

00:23:35.797 --> 00:23:38.669
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
