1
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:50,790
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,250
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:54,919
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,588
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,091
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:18,109
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow</i>

9
00:01:18,193 --> 00:01:22,739
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:25,909
<i>Sailed toward different dreams</i>

11
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:27,911
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:32,957
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see</i>

13
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,342
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny</i>

15
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:45,053
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,347
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,602
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past</i>

18
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,479
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:59,401
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>We know we'll get there</i>

20
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,444
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:07,200
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true</i>

22
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,215
<i>A glimpse of the sun rising</i>
<i>on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,842
[SANJI]
Now's our chance!

25
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,093
[JONATHAN grunting]

26
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,344
[JESSICA]
We almost had them!

27
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,805
[LUFFY]
See ya 'round, fortress guy!

28
00:02:28,888 --> 00:02:30,807
You don't know me?! [screams]

29
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,059
[DRAKE]
Lock him up, men!

30
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,353
You should be more
grateful to Robin.

31
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,813
[gasps] I see.

32
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,358
Robin knew that I would really
be safer here with you.

33
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,820
[ROBIN] We may have had a chance
for a clean escape earlier.

34
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:47,115
Looks like there's only
one way out of this place.

35
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:53,288
[LUFFY] "Luffy and Sanji's
Daring Rescue Mission!"

36
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,751
[OFFICER B]
Listen up, men!

37
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,836
Among the Straw Hats
we've captured,

38
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,380
one was impersonating
a Marine officer!

39
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,842
So in the future, do not worry
about reports or paperwork.

40
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:08,345
If you see an
unidentified person,

41
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,555
arrest him immediately!

42
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:12,098
[MARINES]
Sir!

43
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,149
[WORKER G]
Did you hear?

44
00:03:21,232 --> 00:03:23,193
That long-nosed guy that
was snooping around here

45
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:26,279
is a crewmember
of the Straw Hats.

46
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:27,489
[WORKER E]
I wonder what he was doing

47
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,199
nosin' around this dock?

48
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,909
Yeah, there's an
entire harbor here

49
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,452
full of ships that
are way better than

50
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,371
this sad little hunk of junk.

51
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:35,914
He could've hopped in
any of these ships

52
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:37,165
and sailed away.

53
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:38,708
[WORKER G] Pirates are
dumber than I thought.

54
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,126
[WORKER E]
Me too, and I already thought

55
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,003
they were pretty
dumb to begin with!

56
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:46,466
[WORKER G, WORKER F laughing]

57
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,472
Hey, already callin' it
quits for the day, Mechao?

58
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:56,267
[MECHAO] Cut this old geezer
some slack, will ya?

59
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,477
Did he say "geezer"?

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,770
[WORKER E]
We must've heard wrong!

61
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,023
[BOTH laugh]

62
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:13,993
[SANJI]
You numbskull!

63
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:15,912
At least try to be careful!

64
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,789
[LUFFY]
Oh. Sorry.

65
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:24,421
[SANJI] This fortress is really
starting to drive me nuts!

66
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:27,424
[LUFFY] Hey, Sanji,
where are Zoro and Usopp?

67
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:31,428
[SANJI] Well, detective,
since they were captured,

68
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,138
they're probably in the brig.

69
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,223
[LUFFY]
Awesome! To the brig!

70
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:37,934
[SANJI] Do you know where the
brig is, oh fearless leader?

71
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,561
[LUFFY]
No, I thought you knew.

72
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:41,563
[SANJI]
How would I know that?

73
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,482
[LUFFY]
Hmm.

74
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:49,529
That big bellybutton island
with the guns looks suspicious.

75
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:50,864
Yeah? Why's that?

76
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,948
I dunno.

77
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:53,825
[SANJI grunts]

78
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:57,120
In any case, you might
just be on to something.

79
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,122
It's surrounded by the sea.

80
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:03,126
And the only way to get there
is to cross that bridge.

81
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:05,045
It won't be easy,
but we gotta try.

82
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:06,546
[LUFFY]
All righty!

83
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:07,881
[BOTH]
Hm?

84
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:15,597
Damn. This plan is already
a pain in the neck.

85
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,228
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

86
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,481
[MARINE A] Sir! I'm in
section 4 of block F.

87
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,107
Nothing unusual to report.

88
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,859
[OFFICER D]
Good work! Keep searching!

89
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:28,943
[MARINE A]
Yes, sir!

90
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:33,907
Crap.

91
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,825
The patrols are using
mini-transponder snails

92
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,077
to communicate.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,495
This'll be tough.

94
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:39,662
[LUFFY]
Hey, Sanji.

95
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:40,830
[SANJI]
Hm?

96
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:43,458
Secret missions are
fun, huh? [giggles]

97
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,627
[SANJI]
Get a move on, monkey boy!

98
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,383
[MARINE X humming]

99
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,884
[MARINE X grunts]

100
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:05,939
[SHEPHERD groaning]

101
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,443
What the? [gasps]

102
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:11,945
[MARINE X]
Don't move!

103
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,719
[ROBIN]
This is strange.

104
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:39,014
There's times when no
ships enter or leave.

105
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:40,473
Why is that?

106
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,600
[ROBIN gasps]

107
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,064
[ROBIN]
I'm being watched.

108
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:53,028
[SHEPHERD] What do you think
you're doing, soldier?

109
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,196
Do you peons know who I am?

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,867
Hah. Oh, yeah, you made sure
to tell us over and over.

111
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,204
You're Special Inspector
Major Shepherd from HQ, right?

112
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,665
[SHEPHERD] If you know who
I am and you value your job,

113
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,250
then get me out of here!

114
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:10,587
I have to speak to Commander
Jonathan immediately!

115
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,505
[USOPP]
Major Shepherd?

116
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:16,426
[USOPP]
This must be the Marine bigwig

117
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,303
that Robin was pretending to be!

118
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,680
Those guards think
he's one of us!

119
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,017
[USOPP]
In that case...

120
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,936
[USOPP] That's enough!
You're embarrassing yourself!

121
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,481
A man's gotta know
when he's done for.

122
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:32,233
Struggling will only
make it worse.

123
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,736
Good to see you, Condoriano.

124
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,530
C-Condoriano? Who is that?

125
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,032
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,241
Hey, now.

127
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,660
Stop kidding around,
ole' buddy, ole' pal.

128
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:44,871
Don't tell me you've already
forgotten your own name,

129
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,206
and my beautiful face!

130
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,708
[SHEPHERD grunts]
Get away! I'm not your buddy!

131
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:52,170
Soldier! I don't know this man!

132
00:07:52,253 --> 00:07:54,923
What happened to you?

133
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,008
Did the fall damage
your fragile brain?

134
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,760
Oh, no, say it ain't so!

135
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,137
How--how sad!

136
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,639
I'm begging you!

137
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,558
Please let this wretch with
the broken mind out of here!

138
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:09,396
He's not the same Condoriano
that I once knew!

139
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,897
[MARINE A]
Well, that settles it.

140
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,316
Yep, no point in
interrogating him.

141
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,985
What do you lemmings
mean "that settles it"?

142
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,362
Wait! Where're you going?

143
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,738
I'm ordering you!

144
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:19,823
Come back!

145
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,825
I'll have you all
court-martialed!

146
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:22,826
[ZORO]
Condoriano.

147
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:23,993
Huh?

148
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,248
Condoriano?

149
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,419
I think we've had just
about enough of that crap.

150
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,295
[USOPP]
Nice move, Zoro!

151
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,673
[USOPP giggling]
It worked!

152
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:39,300
You owe me big time, Robin!

153
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,970
[ZORO] Stop it, Usopp,
you're creeping me out.

154
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,737
[LUFFY groans, chuckles]

155
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,779
[DRAKE]
Commander.

156
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,197
We haven't received
a single report

157
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:04,701
on the whereabouts of Luffy
or the other Straw Hats.

158
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,745
[JONATHAN]
Hmm...

159
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:11,541
Have you decided on a
course of action yet?

160
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,378
[JONATHAN]
My guess is that they're

161
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,173
having a hard time
finding the brig.

162
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:19,758
Maybe we should
guide them to it.

163
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,343
Huh?

164
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,345
[JONATHAN] Take your men to the
brig and wait for them there.

165
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:26,765
But be careful not to
spring the trap too soon.

166
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:29,017
Uh--sir!

167
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,355
[JONATHAN chuckles]

168
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,859
[JONATHAN]
This is a battle of wits, Luffy,

169
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:41,279
and you are simply
out of your league.

170
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,620
What are you waiting for, Sanji?

171
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:50,205
Hush.

172
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,498
Dammit.

173
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:55,043
We're gonna have to
fight our way through.

174
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,172
[SANJI]
Hello.

175
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,925
The underside of the bridge
is completely unguarded.

176
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,426
C'mon, Luffy! That's our way in!

177
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,720
Huh? Cool!

178
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:12,018
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

179
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,728
[JONATHAN]
This is Commander Jonathan.

180
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,647
[MARINE F]
Reporting in, sir!

181
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,607
The suspect we took
into custody earlier

182
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:19,359
was identified by
the long-nosed man

183
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,861
as a Straw Hat named Condoriano.

184
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,614
Condoriano?

185
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:25,532
[MARINE F]
Yes, sir!

186
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:26,783
He has repeatedly claimed

187
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,910
that he is Special
Inspector Shepherd.

188
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:30,203
[JONATHAN]
Hmm.

189
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,497
[MARINE F] But we now
know that he was lying.

190
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,166
[JONATHAN]
Very good. Keep me updated.

191
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:43,091
[JONATHAN]
There are two Shepherds, huh?

192
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,096
[JONATHAN]
Your move, Luffy!

193
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,037
Hey, Zoro.

194
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,290
You get the feeling
something's not right here?

195
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:17,959
There's tension in
the air. I feel it.

196
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,312
[MECHAO gasps]

197
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,900
Huh? Mechao?

198
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:44,319
Yeah. The guy from the docks!

199
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:45,570
What?

200
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,822
What are you doing here,
you crazy old fart?

201
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,992
[MECHAO] I came down here to
ask a question, that's all!

202
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:52,660
There's no need
for those swords!

203
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,204
Put 'em away!

204
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,461
[ZORO]
Hmph. It's a trap.

205
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:03,838
So. The question.

206
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,256
[MECHAO]
It's not for you.

207
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,926
I need to talk to Long-nose
in that cell over there.

208
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,511
[growls] Wait!

209
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:11,721
You can't just walk in here and
start talking to the prisoners!

210
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,933
[MECHAO] It won't take long.
I'll be gone before you know it.

211
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:15,809
Hey!

212
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,269
Uh, you're that guy from--

213
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:19,979
[DRAKE growls]

214
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,564
[USOPP] Did anything
happen to the Merry?

215
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,149
Is she all right?

216
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:26,569
Don't worry, she's in good hands
for the time being, I promise.

217
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:27,904
Your ship is okay.

218
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,907
[sighs] What a relief!

219
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,743
You're the one who does the
repairs on that ship, right?

220
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:36,830
Uh? Yeah, well...

221
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:39,165
You gotta to do something
about those mast plates.

222
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,041
[USOPP]
Hm?

223
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,459
If you nail steel plates down

224
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,086
without applying
a proper splice,

225
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,629
the mast will snap like a twig

226
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:46,756
at the first sign
of a strong wind.

227
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,924
A splice?

228
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:50,218
Really? You don't know
what a splice is?

229
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,594
Actually,

230
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:55,348
I have to admit I'm not
really a bonified mechanic.

231
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,934
The one who fixed
the ship, uh...

232
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:03,440
Did he do all the repairs
in just one night?

233
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:06,109
[USOPP] Yeah! It happened
in a place called sky island

234
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,362
that's miles and miles
above the ocean!

235
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:11,197
[MECHAO]
Miles above the ocean?

236
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,408
Yeah, yeah, it's okay
if you don't believe me,

237
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:14,951
I mean who would?

238
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,829
[MECHAO] Hmm... Well,
come to think of it,

239
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,248
your ship did fall out
of the sky, didn't it?

240
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,667
What? You're not
gonna call me a liar?

241
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,210
[MECHAO] I might've thought
you were pulling my leg

242
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:26,171
if I didn't see it
with my own eyes.

243
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:28,131
But considering the
angle that it came down,

244
00:13:28,214 --> 00:13:31,343
it looks like your ship fell
from a considerable height.

245
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:32,469
It was crazy!

246
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,970
There were gods and angels!

247
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:37,098
We saw things up there
I never even dreamed of!

248
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:40,185
[MECHAO]
Gods and angels? Ha, ha, ha.

249
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:43,188
Sounds to me like you died
and came back to life!

250
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:44,314
[USOPP]
There were close calls,

251
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:45,899
but I don't think
I actually died.

252
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:50,153
[USOPP, MECHAO laughing]

253
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,196
[MECHAO]
Oh, right!

254
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,989
About what you were
saying earlier.

255
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,157
Think back to the night

256
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,201
that the mystery man
repaired your ship.

257
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:59,037
Tell me, did he appear from
the mist late in the night?

258
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,873
Yeah, he did! How in the
world did you know that?

259
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,709
Hold on, do you know
who this guy is?

260
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,007
I think I know what
you saw that night.

261
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:15,512
[MECHAO]
Huh? Hey, what's goin' on?

262
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:17,305
Times up, old man!

263
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,058
We've got business
to attend to here.

264
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:21,267
Show him the way out.

265
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,978
--[MARINE G] Yes, sir.
--[MECHAO] No, stop!

266
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,856
Wait! Mechao, tell me what
it was I saw that night!

267
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,608
Please, tell me!

268
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,151
I didn't get a
chance to tell you

269
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,404
the most important thing of all!

270
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,030
When you make repairs
to the ship,

271
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,116
always pay special
attention to the parts

272
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:38,201
that you normally
wouldn't bother with!

273
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:40,245
Those are the areas
that need it most!

274
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:43,331
If you treasure that ship half
as much as I think you do,

275
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,375
you'll do well
never to forget that!

276
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,043
Did you get all that?

277
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,504
Yeah! I got it, old man!

278
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,132
And I'll always remember that!

279
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,384
[grunts]

280
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,185
[chuckles]

281
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,653
[LUFFY]
Someone came out.

282
00:15:13,737 --> 00:15:14,988
[SANJI]
I don't like it.

283
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:18,158
Something definitely seems
fishy about that place.

284
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,951
Well, let's do it!

285
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,161
Hold on.

286
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:23,538
Let's take a minute
and think this through.

287
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,916
The path we took to get here
was completely unguarded.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,419
It's like they're
showing us where to go.

289
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:31,504
That can only mean one thing.

290
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:32,630
[LUFFY]
I know!

291
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:35,467
The boss of this
fortress is a nice guy!

292
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,887
They're planning to ambush us.

293
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:42,057
If anything, it saves
time for those jerks.

294
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,185
We'd literally be
walking into a jail cell.

295
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,770
What are we waiting for?

296
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:48,271
So it's a trap, big deal.

297
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:50,732
We won't get any rescuing done
if we don't go in there.

298
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:54,527
Are you saying you want us
to run headlong into a trap?

299
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:56,237
[LUFFY]
Hm?

300
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,948
[SANJI] Barging into a Marine
brig is never a good idea,

301
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,493
but it's better than
doing nothing at all.

302
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:04,371
I'm also worried about
Nami and Robin.

303
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:07,165
Sanji, it's not such a bad idea.

304
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:08,500
[SANJI]
Yes it is!

305
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,001
[LUFFY]
But you like it, huh?

306
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,920
[SANJI]
No, I don't!

307
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,470
Um, there's nothing in here.

308
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:22,472
Just get moving, all right?

309
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:23,932
Can do!

310
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:28,311
[LUFFY]
Hey! Zoro! Usopp!

311
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,689
Where are you?

312
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,109
Wait. That sounds
like Luffy's voice!

313
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,611
[LUFFY]
Hey!

314
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,946
It is Luffy!

315
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,365
Hey! Luffy, down here!

316
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,201
Usopp. The guards can
hear him coming, too.

317
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,870
[USOPP gasps]
No! Turn back!

318
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,956
But then who's gonna
come rescue us?

319
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,083
I'm confused.
Tell me what to say.

320
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,084
I don't know.

321
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:52,794
They can rescue us
if they want to.

322
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:54,838
[USOPP]
Rescue us if you want to!

323
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,172
[SANJI]
I heard someone!

324
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:57,674
[LUFFY]
This way!

325
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:00,260
Uh-oh, they're here now.

326
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,803
Please be careful, Luffy!

327
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,179
[LUFFY]
Found 'em!

328
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,016
Hold on! We'll get you outta...

329
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,434
[USOPP gasps]

330
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:10,353
No! These bars,
they're Sea Prism Stone!

331
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:12,605
[DRAKE]
We've been waiting for you!

332
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,484
Surrender peacefully and
I might let you live!

333
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,987
Heh. You're kidding me, right?

334
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,531
Do you seriously think
that's enough to stop us?

335
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:23,533
[SERGEANT]
Is this enough for you?

336
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,623
Heh. Now I'm
shaking in my boots.

337
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:32,625
[SANJI]
Okay, now what do I do?

338
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,587
[SANJI]
First things first!

339
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:38,340
What the?

340
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,175
[SANJI grunts]

341
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:41,885
Oh, this is good.

342
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:43,553
It would take nothing
short of a cannon

343
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:46,348
to break those bars down.

344
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,851
[SANJI grunts]
Oh man, that's one tough cage!

345
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,479
A cannon? That's it!

346
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:56,358
Sanji! I think I know
what will do the trick!

347
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:57,442
Reach into my pocket!

348
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:58,401
What for?

349
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,362
I have an impact dial in there.

350
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:02,864
You can use it to
blow up these bars!

351
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,949
Hold on, an impact dial?

352
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:07,494
Isn't that supposed to
hurt whoever sets it off?

353
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,621
Yeah, no time to be wimp though.

354
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:11,539
Hurry up and get it!

355
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,294
What could those Straw
Hat Pirates be up to now?

356
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,505
This is your last warning!

357
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,549
Shut up, gorilla man.

358
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,761
I'm gonna show you something
you might find interesting.

359
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:26,137
A shell?

360
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:29,182
[SANJI] That might not be
the best place to stand.

361
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,809
[USOPP]
Oh, right, right, right.

362
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,602
Here goes.

363
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:36,314
[USOPP]
Who? This well-mannered snake?

364
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:39,401
[DRAKE]
Hm?

365
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:44,531
[USOPP gasps]

366
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,535
You moron!

367
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:50,662
Was that your super
awesome secret weapon?

368
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,414
'Cause it's kinda lame.

369
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,543
Shut up or I'll gut you!

370
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,254
[SERGEANT]
I believe him. I'll shut up.

371
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,588
Oh, uh, sorry, Sanji,

372
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,299
I forgot it's on the
other side. Sorry.

373
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,844
It's, ah, this side here.

374
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,096
Right here...

375
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,222
[USOPP gasps]

376
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:21,568
Stinky.

377
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,236
[DRAKE]
Ahh! This smells like--!

378
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,988
So bad!

379
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:27,282
[gasps] What kind of
juvenile barbarian

380
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:30,076
would store a fart
in my odor dial?

381
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,288
I... thought it would be funny.

382
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,624
Why did I even have to ask?

383
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,294
[SANJI gasps]

384
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,797
Watch out! It's gonna blow!

385
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,132
Get down!

386
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:54,809
[MARINES gasp]

387
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:05,653
[siren blaring]

388
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,405
[OFFICER B] There was
an explosion in the brig!

389
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:10,575
This is not a drill. Let's move!

390
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:22,295
[SANJI grunting]
Hey! You guys okay?

391
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:24,714
Mission... accomplished?

392
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,258
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

393
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:31,513
[USOPP screams]

394
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,265
[LUFFY]
Help me...

395
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,101
[SANJI]
Every time I turn around.

396
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,436
[ZORO grunting]

397
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,735
[ZORO] Well, there's no
point in standing around.

398
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:46,778
Let's get outta here!

399
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,739
[USOPP]
Uh, thanks!

400
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,116
Let's go, Luffy!

401
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:54,911
Right! Everybody run!

402
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:58,748
[USOPP]
Hey! Hey! Wait a sec!

403
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,126
Don't let Zoro lead,
he'll get us lost!

404
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,752
Oh, would you just shut up?

405
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,421
[LUFFY laughs]

406
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:07,716
[DRAKE groans]
Is everyone alive?

407
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,467
[MARINE G groans]
Yeah. I think so.

408
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:10,635
[DRAKE]
Good!

409
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,220
Those of you who can
move, come with me!

410
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,806
We're going after
the Straw Hats!

411
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,224
No escape!

412
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,309
Reinforcements are already
waiting for them outside.

413
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:21,438
We'll catch them again and
execute them on the spot!

414
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,155
Huh.

415
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,990
[USOPP]
I told you! Now we're lost!

416
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,408
[SANJI]
Yeah, where are we?

417
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,035
[USOPP] How do you get lost
going to the front door?

418
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,619
That's almost impossible!

419
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,038
[ZORO]
I said shut up!

420
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,873
[DRAKE]
Commander! I failed.

421
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:42,959
Straw Hat Luffy has
managed to escape the trap!

422
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,544
What about his crewmembers?

423
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:46,796
Roaronoa and the
others with him?

424
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,341
[DRAKE]
Yes, sir! I mean, no, sir!

425
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,885
Well, uh, witnesses
reported that they didn't

426
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:54,721
see Condoriano with them.

427
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:57,098
[JONATHAN chuckles]
Well, Lt. Commander,

428
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,850
the bridge is still
guarded, is it not?

429
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,060
[DRAKE]
Uh, yes, sir!

430
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:01,895
[JONATHAN]
Very good. Then don't panic.

431
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:04,689
We still have plenty of
opportunities to capture them.

432
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,161
[ROBIN]
Well.

433
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:21,039
Sounds like the boys
made their move.

434
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:39,641
<i>A future lies before us</i>
<i>waiting to begin</i>

435
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:42,852
<i>Let's take to the wind!</i>

436
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:47,065
<i>and search the world for answers</i>

437
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:51,444
<i>to all the questions</i>
<i>in our minds</i>

438
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:55,907
<i>Exploring day and night we'll...</i>

439
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,954
<i>...live out our</i>
<i>dreams in paradise!</i>

440
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,623
<i>And that's why...</i>

441
00:23:03,707 --> 00:23:06,668
<i>We're running, and running,</i>

442
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:09,671
<i>traveling along an open road</i>

443
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,966
<i>Never letting go of</i>
<i>what we came to do</i>

444
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,510
<i>We're here to see this through!</i>

445
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,513
<i>We can't lose, can't lose,</i>

446
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,474
<i>nothing on earth</i>
<i>can stop us now</i>

447
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:24,894
<i>'Cause we're not afraid</i>
<i>of our own destiny</i>

448
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:31,568
<i>We Dream and live</i>
<i>our lives free!</i>

449
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,872
[USOPP]
A trap?

450
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,582
[LUFFY] That means
something fun might happen!

451
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:46,750
[ZORO]
Traps schmaps.

452
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,044
Worrying about annoying
stuff is annoying.

453
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,004
[SANJI] We'll see what
kind of trap it is.

454
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,465
[JONATHAN] So, you think you
can escape from Navarone?

455
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:54,758
And from me?

456
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:57,093
[LUFFY] We won't get
caught! We're pirates!

457
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:58,887
On the next One Piece!

458
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,514
"Enter the Hot-Blooded
Special Forces!

459
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:02,974
Battle on the Bridge!"

460
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,977
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
