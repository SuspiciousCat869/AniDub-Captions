1
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,874
[LUFFY] Did you know
there's an awesome treasure

2
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,334
hidden at the end of this sea?

3
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,003
And anyone who finds it
will be King of the Pirates!

4
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,671
Is that exciting or what?

5
00:00:56,755 --> 00:01:00,175
There are incredible adventures
out there just waiting for us!

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,554
<i>BON VOYAGE!</i>

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>Have the courage, set sail</i>
<i>and believe and we will see</i>

8
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:18,151
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow.</i>

9
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,655
<i>Back when we first started,</i>
<i>we had separate horizons</i>

10
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,867
<i>Sailed toward different dreams.</i>

11
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,952
<i>Things have changed now</i>

12
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:33,041
<i>For together we found we look</i>
<i>through the spyglass and see,</i>

13
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:38,338
<i>And we know, that our</i>
<i>hearts have brought us here.</i>

14
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:42,258
<i>Where the compass</i>
<i>points our destiny,</i>

15
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:45,178
<i>There's no looking back,</i>
<i>take the helm with me!</i>

16
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,138
<i>Bon Voyage!</i>

17
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:52,519
<i>We cast off all our troubles,</i>
<i>forget the past.</i>

18
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Though the future's unclear</i>

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,359
<i>We still can smile</i>
<i>we know we'll get there.</i>

20
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>No regrets!</i>

21
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:07,158
<i>Every tear that we've cried only</i>
<i>helps our dreams come true.</i>

22
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:14,249
<i>You and those dreams</i>
<i>are precious in my life.</i>

23
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:22,048
<i>A glimpse of the sun</i>
<i>rising on our tomorrow!</i>

24
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,233
[ENERU] And now the five
of you will continue on

25
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,610
in the final stage of the game.

26
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:44,904
What are you willing
to do for that power?

27
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:47,741
Are you willing
to kill each other?

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,163
[ALL]
You're the only one dying today!

29
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:54,247
[laughing]

30
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,708
[ENERU]
Insolent fools!

31
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:00,712
[LUFFY]
"Showdown in the Ancient Ruins!

32
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,548
Sky God Eneru's Goal!"

33
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:10,722
[CHILDREN laughing]

34
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,390
[CHILD B]
Here!

35
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,392
Hey!

36
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:17,312
[CHILD A] I think this house
belongs to that pretty lady.

37
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:20,482
The one who plays her harp
on the beach all the time.

38
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:24,069
Yeah. You're right.
This is her house. For sure.

39
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:25,195
Her name's Conis,

40
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:27,572
and she lives here with
her dad, Pagaya.

41
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,367
They both seem like
really nice people.

42
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,036
They even invited me over
to have lunch one time.

43
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:35,997
I heard that girl and her
dad are really bad people.

44
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:39,626
Stay away or you'll
get in trouble.

45
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,336
[CHILD C]
My mom told me that, too.

46
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,632
She said that they were
helping the Blue Sea People.

47
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:47,676
[gasps] That can't be.

48
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,719
I swear! It's true!
They're trouble!

49
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:52,889
My father said he'd ground me if
he caught me anywhere near them!

50
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,809
Your father said that... I see.

51
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:59,312
Oh. I'm sorry, I just
remembered your father is...

52
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:02,649
Heh... My daddy's
a member of the Enforcers,

53
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:04,484
and he's out on patrol.

54
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,945
My mom says he'll be
coming home soon.

55
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:10,115
And I can't hardly wait, 'cause
I've never even seen his face.

56
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,241
Oh, man.

57
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:13,243
I think it is so
awesome your dad is

58
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,662
one of the Divine Warriors.

59
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,789
Yeah, it is pretty cool.

60
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,374
[CHILD A]
Yeah it is.

61
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,419
And I'm sure your dad will come
to home to see you real soon.

62
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:23,586
[CHILD B]
Yeah.

63
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:30,260
[horn blares]

64
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:33,680
[MAN A] Skypiea will be dropped
back into the Blue Sea world.

65
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,683
This nation will
no longer exist!

66
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,811
[CONIS] I can't let
his death be in vain.

67
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,438
I must tell the others.

68
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:44,941
I have to warn them,
no matter what it takes.

69
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:56,119
[laughing]

70
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:58,913
[ENERU]
You dare to threaten me?

71
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,378
Listen to yourselves!

72
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:11,426
[laughing]

73
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,970
[whimpering]

74
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:16,765
Whoa. This guy's dangerous!

75
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,601
[ENERU laughing]

76
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,479
I must admit,
I'm quite impressed.

77
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,440
But you have no idea
what you're up against.

78
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:29,361
Even the four of you together
don't stand a chance against me.

79
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:35,158
You cannot comprehend...

80
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:39,621
...the extent of my powers
and what I'm truly capable of.

81
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,167
[laughing] Look at you.

82
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,670
An elderly buffoon
wanting peace.

83
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:50,048
A warrior who single mindedly
seeks his homeland.

84
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:51,966
And thieves from the Blue Sea

85
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,886
who are only concerned
with treasures.

86
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,806
All of you, for one reason
or another, seek to save

87
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:00,350
this wretched place
called Skypiea.

88
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:03,978
But you cannot, because this
nation is fundamentally flawed.

89
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:04,979
[GAN FALL growls]

90
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,606
[GAN FALL]
I refuse to stand here

91
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,274
and listen to such nonsense.

92
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:12,696
Now tell me where
the Divine Warriors are!

93
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,532
And what exactly is
your goal here today?

94
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,492
Why, an ascension.

95
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,827
My old friend.

96
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,495
What do you mean?

97
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:22,956
[ENERU]
I mean, when I ascend

98
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,251
I will return to
my rightful place.

99
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,378
[GAN FALL]
What's that?

100
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,006
Are you saying that you're
leaving Skypiea?

101
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,465
[ENERU]
That's right.

102
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,719
I will soon leave this
dreadful wasteland.

103
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:38,638
On the island where I grew up
there were legends of a place

104
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,765
regarded as God's Home.

105
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,267
As God's home?

106
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,978
People call this place
Endless Vearth.

107
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,647
And there... the ground
extends as far

108
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:51,776
as the eye can see
in all directions.

109
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,739
It's my dream to find
this place. This paradise!

110
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:01,536
Endless Vearth.
A home fit for a God!

111
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,831
My time spent here battling
over the inconsequential

112
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:07,667
lands of the Upper Yard
has been nothing

113
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:10,545
but a petty triviality.

114
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,632
[ENERU]
Listen to me.

115
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:18,887
I tell you this place that you
cherish is an abomination.

116
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,806
Consider this...

117
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,935
[ENERU] It was born in the sky,
though it's not a cloud.

118
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,688
It lives in the sky,
though it's not a bird.

119
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:33,026
[ENERU] This nation
which exists in the sky

120
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:35,737
is an utterly unnatural one.

121
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,616
When we die we all return
to the Earth, to the soil,

122
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,119
but here... there is none.

123
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:45,955
What exactly are you getting at?

124
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,419
[ENERU] You really shouldn't be
surprised by my intentions.

125
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:58,259
As God, I'm bound to adhere to
the divine province on nature.

126
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:01,971
That's why...
this unnatural nation...

127
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,933
...will be ripped apart
and pulled from the sky!

128
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,017
[gasping]

129
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,269
[gasps]

130
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:09,813
[growls]

131
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,401
[GAN FALL] You're planning on
wiping out Skypiea completely?

132
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,778
[ENERU]
It's only natural.

133
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,532
[GAN FALL]
Don't be so conceited.

134
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,909
The term "God" is just
a title used to refer

135
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,078
to the leader of this nation!

136
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,789
True. But that will soon change.

137
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,210
[GAN FALL] A true God does
not live amongst the humans

138
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,547
like you do and treat
them as his playthings!

139
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,091
[ENERU]
Former God...

140
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:42,137
Gan Fall. [laughs]

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,141
You're worried about the
Divine Warriors, are you not?

142
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,521
[ENERU] Six years ago, your
Divine Warriors lost a battle

143
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:55,150
against my forces and I took
650 of your subordinates

144
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,068
under my charge.

145
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,321
They served me well,
until this morning

146
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,532
when I could find no
more use for them.

147
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,368
I told you, did I not?

148
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:09,039
The six of us here now
are the only ones left alive

149
00:09:09,122 --> 00:09:11,332
in this forsaken place.

150
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,084
Such a shame.

151
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:16,087
[GAN FALL]
You... monster...

152
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,548
[ENERU] It's not that I
wanted to harm them.

153
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:22,552
But when I told them my goal,
they dared to challenge me.

154
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:27,182
[laughing] And they paid the
price for that insubordination.

155
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,475
[laughing]

156
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,189
They were good men, and they all
had families on Angel Island.

157
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,732
[ENERU]
Yes, I'm aware.

158
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:39,486
I supposed I'll have to bury
their families beside them.

159
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,990
[GAN FALL]
You are...

160
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:49,454
[GAN FALL]
...the devil!

161
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:52,082
[GAN FALL yelling]

162
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:06,971
[ENERU]
Five million...

163
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,139
Ten million...

164
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,642
Twenty million...

165
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,728
[GAN FALL]
We were...

166
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:20,360
We were consumed by bloodlust.

167
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,404
The Shandorian Warriors.

168
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,573
They only attacked
God's Island, Upper Yard,

169
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,660
because they wanted to regain
the homeland of their ancestors,

170
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,036
which we took.

171
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,538
[squawks]

172
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,581
[PRIEST A] My Lord, you're
not thinking about that again,

173
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,166
are you? Look around.

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,545
Look at the peaceful existence
of the citizens of Skypiea.

175
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,840
It wouldn't be this way had
our ancestors not taken control

176
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:44,718
of the Upper Yard 400 years ago.

177
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,136
And it is our duty

178
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,639
to carry on this battle to
ensure the peaceful nature

179
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:51,433
of this nation.

180
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,852
We've tried to
negotiate with them.

181
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,354
But if they cannot abide
by these negotiations,

182
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,190
they do not deserve
your compassion.

183
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,697
[GAN FALL]
Four hundred years.

184
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,365
I think that it's time for this

185
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,243
endless strife and bloodshed
to come to an end.

186
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:12,954
I only wish that we could
all live in harmony.

187
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:16,249
And put these needless
battles behind us.

188
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:25,759
[PRIEST B]
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

189
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:42,275
[PIERRE whimpers]

190
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,611
[PRIEST A] Is it another attack
by the Shandorians?

191
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:46,321
[PRIEST B]
It's not them.

192
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:47,447
[PRIEST A]
What do you mean?

193
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,908
It's a man who calls
himself God Eneru.

194
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,826
What? God Eneru?

195
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,161
[PRIEST A]
Who does he think he is,

196
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:56,164
presenting himself as
a god before Gan Fall?

197
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,041
[PRIESTS gasp]

198
00:11:58,124 --> 00:11:59,417
[PRIESTS scream]

199
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,223
[gasps]

200
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,268
[GAN FALL]
This can't be...

201
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,437
[ENERU]
Divine Warriors, huh?

202
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,399
They were nowhere near as
formidable as I expected.

203
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,234
Tch. And who are you?

204
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,610
[ENERU]
I guess at the very least

205
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,904
you could say they were
loyal followers.

206
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:28,988
Eneru...

207
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,116
So you're God, huh?

208
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,411
Well, not anymore.

209
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,371
[GAN FALL]
How dare you!

210
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,457
[squawking]

211
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,564
[OHM]
Eneru.

212
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,190
What should we do
with this old man?

213
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,443
He's pathetic. He's useless.

214
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,569
Can we kill him?

215
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,446
[ENERU]
Just throw him into the sea.

216
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,574
I doubt he can even be
used for manual labor.

217
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,618
[ENERU laughs]
This shrine on the other hand

218
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,203
could be quite useful to us.

219
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:21,791
But what we really need are the
services of the Divine Warriors.

220
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,087
They could be put to work in
bringing about my ultimate goal.

221
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:29,215
They will never
help you in your cause.

222
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:32,093
Silence. You're no longer
in charge, old man.

223
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:33,636
[GAN FALL screams]

224
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,848
[ENERU laughing]

225
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,938
[ENERU]
Twenty million volts.

226
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:46,733
[screams]

227
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,902
Vari...

228
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,656
[NAMI]
No, get away from him!

229
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,783
[WYPER gasping]

230
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,039
[ENERU]
God does exist in this world.

231
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:03,249
[GAN FALL]
How mortifying.

232
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,586
And that God is me.

233
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,968
It's the devil fruit.

234
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,637
It's the Rumble Rumble Fruit.

235
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,014
If I'm not mistaken,
this particular fruit

236
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:20,934
is said to have the
power of invincibility.

237
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,397
[ROBIN]
The power of lightning!

238
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,942
But... lightning.

239
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,360
There's no way!

240
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:33,405
A human has no
chance against that!

241
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,617
[ENERU]
It is time.

242
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:43,289
All that I have foreseen
will finally come to be.

243
00:14:43,373 --> 00:14:45,208
The four of you should
feel honored

244
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,419
to have survived this long.

245
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,838
[laughing]

246
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,174
Now... Come along,
you will join me

247
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,845
as I gain passage
to my dream world...

248
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,972
...to the Endless Vearth!

249
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:02,559
Come with me!
Come and fulfill your destinies.

250
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,102
Why would we?

251
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:07,480
[ENERU] There I will build an
indisputable Nation of God!

252
00:15:07,564 --> 00:15:10,150
Where only the chosen ones
are permitted to live.

253
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:14,237
A utopia of boundless
and eternal power.

254
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,364
What is he saying?

255
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,783
[ENERU] I will not let those
who are unworthy,

256
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,453
like those incompetent
subordinates of mine,

257
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:24,122
sully the stature of
this new nation.

258
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,750
Only those who pass
my judgment may bask

259
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,209
in the glory of my company.

260
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:29,210
[ROBIN]
But...

261
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:32,088
And, what will you
do if we refuse?

262
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,965
No. Robin.

263
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,050
[ENERU]
Refuse?

264
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,011
But why? Why refuse to join me?

265
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:40,388
If you stay here you'll
fall into a bottomless pit

266
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,640
along with the rest of
this unnatural nation.

267
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,934
I have no doubt you could
destroy the entirety

268
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:47,228
of the Upper Yard
in one fell swoop.

269
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:50,357
But if you decide to
destroy all this,

270
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,317
then won't you also be
destroying something

271
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,861
that you cherish?

272
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,529
Do you mean the Golden Bell?

273
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,031
[ROBIN]
Yes, that's right.

274
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,824
What's the Golden Bell?

275
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:00,992
[WYPER growls]

276
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,494
[ROBIN]
The Golden Bell.

277
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,537
[ENERU laughs]

278
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,748
Oh, don't worry. No need.

279
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,501
I've already made arrangements.

280
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,754
Based on what I know about
your travels across Skypiea,

281
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:15,840
I believe I know where
the bell is located.

282
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,258
[ROBIN gasps]

283
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:28,978
[ENERU] That's right.
I know what you're thinking.

284
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,898
And it won't be long
before I have the bell.

285
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,442
You seem surprised.

286
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,153
Did you really think
that you, a mere human,

287
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,490
could ever get the better of me?

288
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,867
How foolish of you.

289
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:44,953
[NAMI]
Robin!

290
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,330
There's nothing I hate
more in this world

291
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:50,208
than a cold, calculating woman.

292
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,168

[ENERU]
Hmph.

295
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,013
No...

296
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:04,222

How dare you!

00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,324
Heh.

300
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,452
I do as I please.

301
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:26,828
[ZORO growls]

302
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,093
You've got skills.

303
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:45,013
And you are completely
out of your mind.

304
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,723
[ZORO grunts]

305
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,900
[WYPER]
Burn Bazooka!

306
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:00,820
[ENERU chuckles]

307
00:18:00,904 --> 00:18:02,697
Kari!

00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:06,242
[ZORO grunting]

310
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,049
Uh. No way!

311
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:23,927
How did he manage to neutralize
the bazooka's blast?

312
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,430
[ENERU] Hmph. You still
don't get it, do you?

313
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,766
Your energy doesn't
even register to me.

314
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,103
I'm more powerful than you
could ever comprehend.

315
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,021
The thunderclap reverberated.

316
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:36,940
And that only happens
when the air expands

317
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:38,316
at the speed of sound.

318
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,193
That's really powerful.

319
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:43,446
That amount of power is greater
than anything we can handle.

320
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,656
It's true...

321
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:47,492
He really is made of lightning.

322
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,868
[ENERU]
The time is near.

323
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:50,745
Prepare yourselves.

324
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,706
Soon those who
remain will set off

325
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,624
for the Endless Vearth together.

326
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,503
Do you even understand what
a rare privilege this is?

327
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:01,631
And why do you assume
we'll come willingly?

328
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:02,924
[ENERU]
Hm?

329
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,844
[ZORO growling]

330
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:11,141
[ZORO] I don't give a damn about
your so called "dream world"!

331
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:12,267
Zoro!

332
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,602
Stay away from him!
He's too powerful!

333
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,979
You need a lesson.

334
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:18,273
Soon your body will know

335
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,608
the power of God.

336
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:25,822

[ZORO]
Uh...!

339
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,499
[ENERU]
I possess a tremendous power

340
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,587
that you puny humans can
never hope to overcome.

341
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,423
Can you feel it now?

342
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,467
The despair?

343
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,224
If one loses all hope
it is an experience

344
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:55,602
not unlike losing one's life.

345
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:59,105
[ENERU laughing]

346
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,903

[NAMI]
Zoro!

348
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:11,826
[ENERU] People fear death
above all things.

349
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,792
[ENERU] That's why people
prostrate themselves

350
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,920
before an insurmountable
power and beg for mercy.

351
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,339
It is simply the natural
order of things.

352
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,133
Beings are meant to bow
before that which they fear.

353
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:28,385
It's a shame.

354
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:30,929
You are bound by your instincts.

355
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:34,057
[ZORO] Can't believe how
incredibly strong he is.

356
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:36,810
Hm?

357
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,022
[NAMI gasps]

358
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:47,445
What do you think
you're trying to do?

359
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,823
[panting]

360
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:53,368
And now... time to die.

361
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:58,707
[WYPER] Are you familiar with
the Sea Prism Stone, Eneru?

362
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,625
[ZORO]
Sea Prism Stone?

363
00:21:00,709 --> 00:21:04,796
That's a stone that can
counteract Devil Fruit powers.

364
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:13,513
[ENERU] Well then, do your
worst, Shandorian.

365
00:21:13,596 --> 00:21:14,806
Sea Prism Stone.

366
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:16,182
It's said to harness the power

367
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,477
of the entire ocean
into a single blast.

368
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,063
It's the sea condensed
into solid form.

369
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,357
If anything can overcome
the power of the Devil Fruit,

370
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,067
it's the Stone.

371
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,069
[WYPER]
Die!

372
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,612
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

373
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,948
You're aware of the
consequences, are you not?

374
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,160
Your body will pay a
heavy price, as well.

375
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:38,621
Why sacrifice yourself for a
homeland you will never regain?

376
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:43,293
If I must... I'll die. Glady...

377
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:46,004
If it means I can
take you with me!

378
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:46,921
[gasps]

379
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,965
[ENERU]
Don't do it.

380
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,636
Reject!

381
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:05,482
Hey, did you guys hear that?

382
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:09,903
[NAMI]
No way...

383
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:11,946
He really did it.

384
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,287
[panting]

385
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:30,006
<i>You can't stop me now,</i>
<i>I'm always going...</i>

386
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,593
<i>A to Z, I run</i>
<i>without stopping...</i>

387
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:37,597
<i>Sometimes I worry,</i>
<i>I'm not gonna make it...</i>

388
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:41,184
<i>But I know that,</i>
<i>it's just a little farther...</i>

389
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:44,479
<i>The sea's spread before us,</i>
<i>and our cares are behind...</i>

390
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,983
<i>The sunrise climbs to the sky,</i>
<i>what will we find?</i>

391
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,070
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>follow the shining sun...</i>

392
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:57,283
<i>Watch the horizon,</i>
<i>the journey's just begun...</i>

393
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:00,328
<i>I, never treat you bad...</i>

394
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,247
<i>Even when we fail...</i>

395
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,834
<i>(It's) all right,</i>
<i>we still can't give up now...</i>

396
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,627
<i>('Cause) You and I both know...</i>

397
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,546
<i>(Through) every high and low...</i>

398
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,298
<i>We sail towards tomorrow...</i>

399
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,717
<i>So SMILE!!</i>

400
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,593
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

401
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:19,431
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

402
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,266
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

403
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:25,103
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

404
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:28,273
<i>Come back to your friends...</i>

405
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:44,414
[ENERU]
It's not that people fear God.

406
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:46,332
God is fear itself.

407
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:50,170
And when you look upon me in
fear, you look on me as a God.

408
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:55,008
I will put an end to this nation
in the sky with my mighty power!

409
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:58,011
[LUFFY] What? I don't have a
clue what you're babbling about.

410
00:23:58,094 --> 00:23:59,804
On the next One Piece!

411
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:03,516
"Ambition Toward the Endless
Vearth. The Ark Maxim!"

412
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,102
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
