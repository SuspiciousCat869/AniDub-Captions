00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,753
[CROWD jeers]

2
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,491
Come on...

3
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,228
[ITOMIMIZU]
What incredible speed!

4
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,597
You can hardly call it skating,

5
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,432
but he's definitely
catching up to Porche!

6
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,371
Wall.

7
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,477
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! But a
fancy flying maneuver

8
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,346
sends him sailing
over Masshikaku!

9
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,648
It's only a matter of time
before he catches up to Porche!

10
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,722
Here he comes!
I gotta do something!

11
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,058
He's gonna lap me!
How'd you like this?!

12
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:38,759
No way!

13
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,393
Huh?

14
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,394
Eh?

15
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,397
There you go. Now keep
it up, just like I said.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,600
That's it! Come on, go!

17
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:02,616
[FOXY PIRATE F] Come on!

18
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,452
You can do it!
Just a little further!

19
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,687
[PIRATE VOICE A]
Man, this is great!

20
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,603
What a moment! Inspiring!

21
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:28,608
[LUFFY] All right,
I'm up. Usopp! I'm coming!

22
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,512
Oh, Luffy!

23
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,750
Like this, right?

24
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,288
Aaaaaahhhh!!

25
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,257
It's so fast! Awesome!

26
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,428
I won't let you win!

27
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,468
[ITOMIMIZU]
Incredible! Moments ago,

28
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,704
Straw Hat Luffy couldn't
even stand in his skates,

29
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,705
much less skate in them!

30
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,740
And now he's neck and
neck with Chiqicheetah,

31
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,143
who has powered up with
his Double-Speed Full Dash!

32
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,248
Eh?

33
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,720
Oh, crap! I taught him
how to stand and skate,

34
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,321
but not how to turn!

35
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,723
Aaaahhh!

36
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,424
[crash]

37
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,467
[ITOMIMIZU] Straw Hat Luffy
has once again left the course!

38
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,302
He is now disqualified
from Round 3!

39
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,613
I knew it. He's hopeless.

40
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,816
[ITOMIMIZU]
The speed king, Chiqicheetah,

41
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,052
continues the race
with a four lap lead!

42
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,793
Long Nose!
Take my hand! Hurry!

43
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,133
[ITOMIMIZU] Whoa! Historian
Nico Robin uses a Long Whip

44
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,768
to keep her team in the race!

45
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,503
Will it be enough to
make up for lost time?

46
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,308
Damn that woman!

47
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:09,510
Hahahaha!

48
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,512
Don't worry.
I'll handle it, Porche.

49
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,246
Aaaaugh!

50
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,694
[ITOMIMIZU]
There it is!

51
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,630
Chiqicheetah and his
Triple-Speed Rocket Dash!

52
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,305
Hey! Aren't you
paying attention!

53
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,608
He left the course, dammit!

54
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,109
The air is safe!
The air is safe!

55
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,613
[ITOMIMIZU]
Coach Sanji's angry complaint

56
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,515
is overruled and shot down!

57
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,417
[thinking] I have to do
something before it's too late.

58
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,319
[JUBE]
Mucha Caramente!

59
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,821
[thinking]
Oh, no!

60
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:57,458
I'd try not to
struggle, girl. Got it?

61
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:01,228
The more you wiggle around
the more tangled you become!

62
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,132
Ha ha ha!

63
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:09,502
Fool! I'm an invertebrate!
That does nothing to me!

64
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,242
Feh-feh-feh!

65
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,610
Nice work, Jube!

66
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,045
[JUBE] Hahaha!

67
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,446
Aw, it was nothing!

68
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,283
Oh, no! That freak
took out Robin!

69
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,384
[ZORO]
Hey, Coach Lame Brain.

70
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,586
If we don't do something
about that Chiqicheetah guy

71
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,055
and quick, we're
gonna lose this race.

72
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,623
You don't need to remind me!

73
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:35,496
Wait, Chiqicheetah. "Cheetah."
That just might work!

74
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,800
Hey, you! The old man with
the horse! Are you here?

75
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,503
Huh? Uh, do you mean me?

76
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,806
Yeah! Listen, the Long
Kiwi you gave Luffy.

77
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,641
Where did you
get that thing from?

78
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,176
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,779
Shut it! Come on,
old man! Hurry!

80
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,683
There! They grow on the
branches of those trees!

81
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,650
All right, shrub head!

82
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,319
Bring back a branch
of that tree! Move it!

83
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,321
Hey! Is that any way
to ask for a favor?

84
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:03,190
Look! It might be our only
chance to stop that guy!

85
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,591
Now get going!

86
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,727
With a tree branch?

87
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,463
[SANJI]
Yeah, you heard me! Now hurry!

88
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:10,330
[PIRATE VOICE B]
What the...?

89
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,533
[PIRATE VOICE C]
Hey! What's he doing?!

90
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,034
[TONJIT]
Here! You can ride Shelly!

91
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,535
[ZORO]
Thanks, old man!

92
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,477
[thinking] I don't know
if this'll work or not,

93
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,012
but it's better
than doing nothing.

94
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,716
[ITOMIMIZU] Four
minutes into the race,

95
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:33,687
and Chiqicheetah has
an incredible 13-lap lead!

96
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,591
Now passing the
four-and-a-half minute mark,

97
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,061
and Chiqicheetah's lead
has increased to 15 laps!

98
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,363
Things certainly
aren't looking too good

99
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,164
for the Straw Hat Dangers!

100
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,600
Dammit! Where is he?

101
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,576
There it is.

102
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,311
[ITOMIMIZU] Four minutes
and fifty seconds!

103
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,146
Ten more seconds
and the Foxy Devils

104
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,514
will clinch a shut-out victory!

105
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,119
Not gonna make it!

106
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,328
[ITOMIMIZU]
Only 5 seconds remain!

107
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,200
Wait! What's happening?!
What is that?!

108
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,509
[CROWD screams]

109
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,214
[whistle blow]

110
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,450
[ITOMIMIZU]
What's going on down there?

111
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,451
What happened
to Chiqicheetah?

112
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,659
[ITOMIMIZU]
Chiqicheetah left the course

113
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,696
just before the end of the
round and is disqualified!

114
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,197
What a stunning upset!

115
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,832
In a miraculous
come-from-behind victory,

116
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,735
Round 3 goes to
the Straw Hat Dangers!

117
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,270
[PORCHE]
Chiqicheetah! No!

118
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,007
Eh... What?!

119
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,745
Hu... Hurray.

120
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:08,549
[CROWD complains]

121
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,150
[PIRATE VOICE A]
But, why?!

122
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,752
[PIRATE VOICE B]
What happened?!

123
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,622
Kiwi fruits have
special properties.

124
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,424
In some cases these
properties have been known

125
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,658
to mesmerize cats.

126
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,796
Meaning the smell of the plant
itself is just like catnip.

127
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:25,099
Cheetahs are cats, too.

128
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,234
I figured it
was worth a shot.

129
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,570
[NAMI] I get it!
So that's why he was sniffing

130
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,572
all over Luffy before the race!

131
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,107
[SANJI]
Probably so.

132
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,075
[ROBIN]
Impressive knowledge, Mr. Cook!

133
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,577
[SANJI]
Oh, it was nothing, really!

134
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,287
We won that one by
the skin of our teeth.

135
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,821
[ITOMIMIZU]
The Straw Hat Dangers

136
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,590
have managed to score
a point of their own!

137
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,393
But the Foxy Devils
still have the advantage!

138
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,062
There's no time to bask in the
afterglow of victory, though!

139
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,297
Round 4 will be starting soon!

140
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,201
The Point Getters will be
the historian, Nico Robin,

141
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:07,341
against the fishman, Jube!
We're in for a great race!

142
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,311
Listen. "How to turn."
First, you.

143
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,212
Don't worry I've got it.

144
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,647
What do you mean
you've "got it"?

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,749
You didn't have it a second ago.

146
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,519
Look. I did what
you told me to do.

147
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,689
I watched how everyone
else was skating. I'm ready!

148
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,691
Huh?

149
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,527
We know that he's going to
use that stupid beam again.

150
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,462
Yeah. That "Do-Do Beam"

151
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,697
is going to be a problem.

152
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,432
[FOXY]
Do... Do... Beam?!

153
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,732
Boss!

154
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,236
Usopp! I've got an idea!

155
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,736
Huh? What is it?

156
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,240
[smirks]

157
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,041
You are so naughty!

158
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:43,443
[NAMI evil laughs]

159
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,313
Good idea. Don't you think?

160
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,148
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh!
Do I detect the brewing

161
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,584
of an evil plan from the
heartless and cruel Nami?

162
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,152
Her devious face is showing--

163
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:55,222
[NAMI]
Whose face is devious?!

164
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,089
[USOPP]
Yours.

165
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,411
[ITOMIMIZU]
Round 4 is about to begin!

166
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:25,052
Ha! Ha!
Long time, no see!

167
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,654
[ITOMIMIZU]
Ready? Go!

168
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,329
[thinking]
Oh, no, you don't!

169
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,231
I may not be as
fast as Chiqicheetah,

170
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,798
but I'm no slouch either!

171
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,438
[ITOMIMIZU]
That's 20 seconds! Defense, go!

172
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,742
Is... Is he gonna
be able to do this?

173
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,291
All right!

174
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:08,528
Yes! Yes! Way to go, Luffy!

175
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,498
Bring it on!

176
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,565
I'll be happy

177
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,102
to give you another taste
of my Mucha Caramente!

178
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,770
Oh, no you won't!

179
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,147
[ITOMIMIZU] Oh! Seems like
he's getting the hang of it!

180
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,083
Straw Hat Luffy
sends Jube flying!

181
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,655
Robin! Keep going!
I'll handle this guy!

182
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,756
Right! Thanks!

183
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,745
Hey! My baton's gone!

184
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,215
Sorry!

185
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,483
What?! Gimme that back!

186
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,757
[LUFFY chuckles]

187
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,727
Don't even try. I'd just sit
this one out, if I were you.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,028
Okay!

189
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,465
[ITOMIMIZU]
Astounding!

190
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,601
The Straw Hat Dangers
are on a roll!

191
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,236
They've just taken
a one-lap lead!

192
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:29,543
We'll see about that. Hamburg!
Prepare for a full dash!

193
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,178
[HMABURG]
Right!

194
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,614
[NAMI]
Usopp! It's time!

195
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,617
Yeah! Now, "Operation
Laugh and Fall."

196
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,685
Are you ready for this?

197
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,152
You know it.

198
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,165
[USOPP]
Hey, Split Head!

199
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,767
You gonna use your
Slow-Slow-Do-Do Beam again?

200
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,171
[FOXY]
Split Head?! Do-Do Beam?!

201
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,138
[NAMI]
Don't make fun of him!

202
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,574
He's handsome,
intelligent, and wonderful!

203
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,711
That stupid fox is anything but!

204
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,246
I'm serious about this!

205
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,414
I'm head over heels
in love with him!

206
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,517
[USOPP] Impossible! No one
loves that crappy Split Head!

207
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,253
[FOXY] He added
"crappy" to "Split Head"!!

208
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,420
[NAMI]
Handsome!

209
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,288
[USOPP]
Split Head!

210
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,155
[NAMI]
Wonderful!

211
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,090
[USOPP]
Crappy!

212
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,191
[NAMI]
Smart!

213
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,159
[USOPP]
Lies!

214
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,093
[USOPP]
Stupid Split Head!

215
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,429
You couldn't, Nami,
what are you doing?

216
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,598
You need to keep
complementing him!

217
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,733
But, I can't!

218
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,736
It's making me
sick to my stomach.

219
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,738
You think maybe
we could switch up?

220
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:33,573
Insult me? How dare you!!

221
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,577
But there's nothing
to complement.

222
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,778
It doesn't matter
who says what.

223
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,713
Just keep repeating stuff!

224
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,280
Got it!

225
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,515
Split Head! Split Head!

226
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,350
[USOPP] Split Head! Split Head!
[NAMI] Manly! Manly! Manly!

227
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,818
[ITOMIMIZU] It looks
like the Boss can't seem

228
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,553
to fire his Slow-Slow Beam!

229
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,656
The contradictory verbal
assault by the Straw Hats

230
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,725
has brought him to his knees!
Time's almost up!

231
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,193
[chuckles]

232
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,707
[USOPP] Manly! Manly! Manly!
[NAMI] Split Head! Split Head!

233
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,274
[USOPP]
Manly!

234
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,542
[NAMI]
Split-Head!

235
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,209
[USOPP]
Split-Head!

236
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,043
[whistle blow]

237
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,679
[ITOMIMIZU]
And there you have it!

238
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:17,083
The Straw Hat Dangers
win Round 4 by a landslide!

239
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,254
[sighs]

240
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,194
[ITOMIMIZU] There will
now be a 5-minute break

241
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,762
before the final round begins!

242
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,365
[FOXY growls]

243
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,300
I can't believe I fell for that!

244
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,171
Nor did I expect this to
drag out another round!

245
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,039
Listen! We have
to win the next one!

246
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,176
We'll use the you-know-what
plan to seal our victory!

247
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,277
You got it!

248
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,312
Yeah!

249
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,716
[ITOMIMIZU] Now. It's time for
the final round of the event!

250
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:51,485
Both teams are at the
starting line ready to go!

251
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:55,055
But, it seems that Girarin alone
is representing the Foxy Devils!

252
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,757
The rest of the
team is off the track!

253
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,559
Could this mean
they're planning to use

254
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:00,794
their most devious trick of all?

255
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,196
Devious trick?

256
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,397
Come on! You know
it's just gonna be

257
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,499
that stupid
Slow-Slow Beam again.

258
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,035
Oh! Wow, you figured it out!

259
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,104
Yes. We're going to be
using the Slow-Slow Beam

260
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,538
to stop your Captain.

261
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,275
That's our little
plan in its entirety.

262
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,710
Not that you're gonna be
able to do anything about it!

263
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,545
Hahahaha!

264
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,147
As if! Weren't you
paying attention

265
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,182
to what happened
in the last round?

266
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,551
"Operation Laugh and Fall"
will stop him cold!

267
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,687
Hey! Just skate
like crazy, Luffy!

268
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,156
Yeah! Leave
everything to me!

269
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,259
[ITOMIMIZU] Okay! It's time
to begin the final round!

270
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,728
Ready? Go!

271
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,500
Feh-feh-feh-feh!

272
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,635
Oh, no! He's starting already?!

273
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:48,441
[USOPP] Split Head! Split Head!
[NAMI] Manly! Manly! Manly!

274
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,780
Slow-Slow Beam!

275
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:56,450
[ITOMIMIZU] There it is!
An onslaught of Slow-Slow Beams!

276
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,417
What's going on?

277
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,086
Why isn't "Operation
Laugh and Fall" working?

278
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,423
Feh-feh-feh!

279
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:06,126
Huh? Were you two
saying something?

280
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,361
[ITOMIMIZU]
Ear plugs!

281
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,397
The Straw Hat Dangers
have been outsmarted!

282
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,232
That's our boss for you!

283
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,202
We are screwed!

284
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,241
[GIRARIN chuckles]

285
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:24,278
Huh? What the! Did he just
deflect the Slow-Slow Beam?!

286
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,746
Oh, you noticed?

287
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,716
Yes, the Slow-Slow Beam
doesn't work on Girarin.

288
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:32,219
What? Really? No way?
How is that possible?

289
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:36,690
Sorry, but.
It's... a... se-cret!

290
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,227
A secret! Oh! That
makes perfect sense!

291
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,062
Ah, now I get it.

292
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:45,266
That's why the rest of your
team wasn't on the course.

293
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,234
Yep! This way, you can't hide

294
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,137
from the beam behind
any of the Foxy Devils.

295
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,272
You're whole team
is gonna be turned

296
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:54,742
into slowpokes,
but we won't!

297
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:57,444
This is bad! Now
what are we gonna do?

298
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,115
[ITOMIMIZU] Twenty seconds
are up! Defenders, go!

299
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,583
Feh-feh-feh!

300
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:05,185
Time for you two to slow down!

301
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,322
No!

302
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,958
Nami!

303
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:14,194
[ITOMIMIZU] A direct hit!
Navigator Nami and Sniper Usopp

304
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,731
have fallen prey to
the Slow-Slow Beam!

305
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,105
[ROBIN]
Luffy! Behind you!

306
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,344
[ITOMIMIZU] Straw Hat Luffy
has been stopped in his tracks!

307
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:33,180
Victory is now a near-certainty
for the Foxy Devils!

308
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,815
Feh-feh-feh!

309
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,084
Now it's your turn!

310
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,486
[thinking] There's no way
I can dodge his attacks!

311
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,056
If I let that beam
hit me, we're done for!

312
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,090
Only one thing to do.

313
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,532
Huuuuuuh?

314
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:57,204
[ITOMIMIZU]
Oh! What's this?

315
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:59,673
Nico Robin, who has been
keeping the Straw Hat Dangers

316
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:03,410
in the game, has
suddenly given up?!

317
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:06,113
With only one minute
remaining in the round,

318
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,316
she has stepped off the course!

319
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,784
[thinking] The effects
of the Slow-Slow Beam

320
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,053
last for 30 seconds.

321
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:15,122
If Luffy can dodge
the next attack,

322
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,824
he'll still have
a chance to win.

323
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:19,293
Failure is not an option.

324
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:23,197
I have to wait for
just the right moment.

325
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,233
Robin? What are you doing?

326
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,534
If I'm over
here with you two,

327
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,237
I can avoid being hit
by that beam, right?

328
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,572
Hmmm?

329
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,207
Yeah, but.

330
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,041
Hahaha!

331
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:34,975
[ITOMIMIZU]
Forty seconds remain,

332
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,045
and Girarin has an
easy, three-lap lead!

333
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,719
[FOXY] Think I'll give
you two another dose,

334
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,055
just to be on the safe side.

335
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,757
Feh-feh-feh!

336
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,561
All right, Straw Hat Luffy!

337
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,765
It's been a lot of fun,
but now it's time to end this!

338
00:19:57,798 --> 00:19:59,767
Feh-feh-feh!

339
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,635
[ITOMIMIZU]
Only 30 seconds remain!

340
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,138
If Straw Hat Luffy is
hit with another beam,

341
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:07,407
victory for the Foxy
Devils is guaranteed!

342
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,083
[FOXY]
This ends now!

343
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:26,827
Oh, crap!

344
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,629
Luffy! Move it! Get going!

345

Mucha Cara...

00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,054
So, how should I prepare you?

349
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,156
Grilled or deep fried?

Ten seconds left!

These two are
neck and neck now,

353

and it'll be a mad
dash for the finish!

354

N-No... you wouldn't...!
Arrrrg!

Only five seconds left!

357
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,261
Those dull blades
won't work on me!

358
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:39,099

to pull off a
come-from-behind victory!

363
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,346

I told you we'd win!

368

[FOXY] As a pirate,
I refuse this outcome!

369

I challenge you

What?!

"Screaming Hot Bombardment!
Pirate Dodgeball!"

King of the Pirates!
