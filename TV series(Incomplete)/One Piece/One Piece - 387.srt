1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,283
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,630
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:45,201
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:51,141
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,174 --> 00:02:53,710
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:57,280
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:59,783
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:03,353
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:06,456
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,060
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,396
[NARRATOR] As the
Straw Hat Pirates continued

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,731
toward Fishman Island,

49
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,600
they drew near the halfway
point of the Grand Line.

50
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:20,804
Chopper!

51
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:23,773
[CHOPPER screaming]

52
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,714
[FRANKY]
Coup De Burst!

53
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:43,259
I can't even see
the top! It's huge!

54
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:46,596
[NARRATOR] Then they reached the
Red Line for the second time.

55
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,436
[NARRATOR] Once there, they
encountered Camie the mermaid

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,505
and Pappagu the starfish fishman

57
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:58,808
after rescuing them
from the belly of a sea king.

58
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,111
Anyway, thanks for
saving my life back there.

59
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:04,214
[HACHI] Nyuu!
Camie, you're all right.

60
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:05,648
[NARRATOR] Camie
pleaded with the Straw Hats

61
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,584
to save her
captured friend, Hachi.

62
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:09,552
And so the crew set
course for the base

63
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:11,354
of the Flying Fish Riders.

64
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,426
Wait, what?
Someone's here?

65
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,727
Ahh! Look!

66
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,063
It's the Flying Fish Riders!

67
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:28,171
Hey! It's them!

68
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,439
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Yeah, you're right!

69
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,808
Those are the Straw Hat Pirates
down there, no doubt about it!

70
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:35,578
[DUVAL]
The very pirate ship

71
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,615
I've been searching for
all this time.

72
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:43,186
All my waiting will
finally come to an end.

73
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,890
[DUVAL]
I'll have my revenge!

74
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:51,194
I'll kill that bastard
that ruined my life!

75
00:04:58,935 --> 00:05:00,370
[LUFFY]
The Fated Reunion!

76
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,739
Save the Captive Fishman!

77
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:08,878
[SEAGULLS cawing]

78
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:11,214
[CHOPPER]
The Flying Fish just left?

79
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,550
[FRANKY] And they were the ones
who started the attack.

80
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,551
Weird.

81
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:16,586
[ROBIN] It seemed like
they received a message.

82
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,888
Maybe it was an order
for them to retreat?

83
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:20,456
I can't imagine why, though.

84
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,691
[LUFFY]
Those Flying Fish are cool!

85
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:22,692
I wanna ride one!

86
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,761
They can stay in the air
for five minutes, right?

87
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:26,262
That's five minutes
of awesome for me!

88
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,564
We're headed to their base now,

89
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:29,399
so we'll see them
again soon enough.

90
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:30,533
We better be careful, though.

91
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,435
It might not be
so easy next time.

92
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,369
[LUFFY] We could put it in the
aquarium with the other fish!

93
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:35,638
Then we could ride it
whenever we want!

94
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,941
Least we know they can attack
from the sea or the air.

95
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:40,410
Hey, how about lining
the deck with cannons?

96
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,512
Sniper Usopp will
blow 'em outta the sky!

97
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:44,314
Good thinkin', bro!

98
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,384
I'm worried.

99
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:50,220
I wonder if Hatchin is okay.

100
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:51,955
Worry about yourself
while you're at it, Camie.

101
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,890
Macro wants to catch you bad!

102
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,725
Don't drop your guard!

103
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,329
Yeah, you're right.

104
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:05,802
[RANDOM FISH RIDER 387A]
Master Duval!

105
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,704
The three riders have returned!

106
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:15,445
[FISH RIDER 387A]
I don't get it.

107
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:17,213
Why'd you ask us
to call off the attack?

108
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,348
[FISH RIDER 386A]
Yeah, what gives?

109
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,749
[FISH RIDER 386B] We could
have captured the mermaid

110
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,819
and those pirates
in one fell swoop!

111
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,621
[DUVAL]
Idiots!

112
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,322
[screaming]

113
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,363
[DUVAL]
Listen up.

114
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:38,701
I told you a million times,
I want those pirates alive.

115
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:41,971
'Cause I'm gonna
rip 'em limb from limb.

116
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,574
With my own two hands.

117
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:48,912
[DUVAL] Whenever I start
thinkin' about that guy,

118
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:52,548
it's like I got an itch
on my back I can't scratch,

119
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:55,852
and I swear it gets
worse every time!

120
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,654
No. Ah, no.

121
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,489
Here comes the accent!

122
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:03,726
[DUVAL] Every day I've
cursed that man's name.

123
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,964
Every day,
my hate for him grows.

124
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:10,466
It burns.

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,636
Head, just calm down!
Get a hold of yourself!

126
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,672
[DUVAL] And now that
bastard's comin' straight

127
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:16,940
to my front door.

128
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:19,375
And I'm gonna kill 'im!

129
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:23,746
This day is gonna be perfect,
even if it kills me!

130
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,582
You got that? You understand?

131
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:27,650
Yes!

132
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:30,353
I understand completely.
We won't ruin it for you!

133
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:34,390
[DUVAL] That's why you gotta
follow my orders to the "T."

134
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,292
'Cause I'm gonna
murder this punk,

135
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,795
and ain't nobody
gonna get in my way!

136
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:41,030
Okay, Head, whatever you want.

137
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:42,966
[DUVAL]
Hey, Macro Gang.

138
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,401
Yeah? What do you want?

139
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:46,903
What is it... Duva?

140
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,304
Wait, did you say "Duva"?

141
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:49,639
And you too, Tansui.

142
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:51,507
Can't you show a little
more respect than that?

143
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,709
You need to learn some manners!

144
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:55,712
Ahaha! He said "Duva".
That's funny.

145
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:56,779
That's enough!

146
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,314
I'm so very sorry.

147
00:07:58,348 --> 00:07:59,582
You were saying,
Master Duval, sir?

148
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:00,483
Hey, Boss.

149
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:02,952
That mask guy talks funny.
Heh heh heh!

150
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:04,654
Will you shut up already?

151
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:06,622
My most sincere
apologies, Master.

152
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:07,991
These two are as dumb as bricks.

153
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,625
Just ignore everything they say

154
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,694
and I promise
they'll get the job done.

155
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:16,432
[DUVAL] You can run your
stupid fish mouths all day.

156
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:17,867
I don't care!

157
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,037
Far as I'm concerned, you're
my angels of good fortune.

158
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,806
I can't even begin to
tell you how grateful I am

159
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,109
for our little arrangement here.

160
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:26,843
You could try.

161
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:29,579
I told you to
shut up, Tansui!

162
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,483
[DUVAL] You can call it luck,
but thanks to you three,

163
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,486
I can finally meet
the Straw Hat Pirates.

164
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,488
I'll get my revenge.

165
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:42,025
Then I can finally
get my life back.

166
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,027
"Straw Hat Pirates"?

167
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,629
Uh... Now who might
they be, exactly?

168
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:47,764
[HACHI]
The Straw Hats?

169
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:51,601
It wasn't just my
imagination! Nyuuu!

170
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:53,770
[DUVAL]
Now listen good.

171
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:55,671
That guy...

172
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:59,075
The one I gotta kill
if it's the last thing ah do.

173
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,544
He's on that boat,
I can feel it!

174
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:04,747
I can feel my hands around
his neck as we speak!

175
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:05,815
[FISH RIDER 386B]
Head! Your accent!

176
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,817
You gotta calm down!

177
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,420
Man, he must really hate
the crap outta that guy.

178
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,955
[HACHI] I never thought I'd hear
the name "Straw Hat Pirates"

179
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:14,557
way out here.

180
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,526
[HACHI]
Nyuu! Hey! Big guy!

181
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,627
Agh!

182
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,563
That's "Master Duval".
Show him some damn respect!

183
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:21,964
[HACHI] You're saying
Camie has been captured

184
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:23,933
by the Straw Hat Pirates?

185
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,137
[HACHI] Nyuu.
This is bad. Really bad.

186
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,606
Of all the people
she could run into.

187
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,508
And they're all on
their way here together?

188
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:33,576
So it would seem.

189
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,044
They'll arrive any time now.

190
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:37,080
But she didn't seem
all that "captured" to me.

191
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:39,615
Looked more like she turned
to those pirates for help.

192
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,716
[FISH RIDER 387A]
Far as I could tell,

193
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,985
it looked like they were
working together just fine.

194
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,521
Well, it doesn't matter
who she brings.

195
00:09:45,555 --> 00:09:47,190
In the end, they'll all
be rounded up, caught,

196
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,791
and sold to the Human Shop.

197
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:50,693
Once they're here,
they're history.

198
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:53,663
[laughing]

199
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:54,764
[HACHI]
That's what you think!

200
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:57,800
Those Straw Hats
are crazy strong!

201
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,669
Nyuu, I'm in trouble.

202
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,904
I wonder if Nami's
still with them, too.

203
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:03,906
I wonder if she's
still mad at me.

204
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,576
Well, duh.
Of course she would be.

205
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,511
I did all those
horrible things to her

206
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,446
when I was working for Arlong.

207
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,815
If I don't hurry up and
figure out some way to escape

208
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,851
before they get here,
I'll get my butt kicked

209
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,019
just as much as
these other guys.

210
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,535
I'm so screwed!

211
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,002
Whoa...

212
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,903
Hey, Master Duval!

213
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,106
The Straw Hats are here!

214
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,941
[DUVAL]
Finally.

215
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,377
The time has come.

216
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,479
Uh... Hey, Macro?

217
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,381
Yeah? Whadda ya want?

218
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,116
How 'bout you let me go

219
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,817
and I give you some
octopus fritters?

220
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,352
I can buy my own
damn seafood!

221
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,788
What kind of glutton
do you think I am?

222
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,293
[DUVAL] Did you see him?
Is he on the ship?

223
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,161
[FISH RIDER 387B]
Yes, Head!

224
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,229
He's there for sure!

225
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,196
All right, then.

226
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,364
Now that everything
appears to be in order,

227
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,401
I think it's time for you
to get what's coming to you.

228
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,136
Hey, Gyaro,
if you let me go,

229
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,237
I'll give you
lots of fritters.

230
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,039
Oh, come on.
No one's gonna...

231
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,006
Hey!

232
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,975
You're not actually
considering his bribe?!

233
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,476
[DUVAL]
Get to work, you maggots!

234
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,711
[ALL]
Sir!

235
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,480
[HACHI]
Hey, Tansui.

236
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,516
Listen. You like fritt--augh!

237
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,085
Oh, just knock it off already!

238
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,892
Hey, I see something!

239
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,826
[FRANKY]
From the looks of it,

240
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,096
I bet that's the
Flying Fish Rider's base.

241
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,031
So Camie's friend
Hatchin is being held

242
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,333
somewhere around here, right?

243
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,368
Hatchin...

244
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,269
[LUFFY]
Let's get moving!

245
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,371
We gotta save those
octopus fritters!

246
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,441
[FRANKY] What, did you miss your
snacktime today or something?

247
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,012
I'll go in there and
save him before you know it,

248
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,846
beautiful Camie!

249
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,482
Thanks!
You're the best, Sanjichin!

250
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,351
Hold on, guys!
Before you go, listen up!

251
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,187
[CAMIE]
Be careful out there, okay?

252
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,189
The Macro Gang have
managed to capture me

253
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,957
over 30 times already!

254
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,827
You get captured
way too often!

255
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,795
[USOPP] You get eaten
too often, too.

256
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,237
Looks like we're
about to cross over

257
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,239
into enemy territory.

258
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,208
I think my "can't go
on this island" disease

259
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,275
is coming back.

260
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,010
Well, this isn't
really an island.

261
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,046
They just built a village
on top of the water.

262
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,147
You should be good.

263
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,149
I mean I'm getting that
"I shouldn't go to a village

264
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,218
that someone built
on the water" disease!

265
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,352
That's weird.

266
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,122
Why would anyone wanna set up
their base way out here?

267
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,857
Ah, who knows?

268
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,130
For an enemy base,
it's sure quiet.

269
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,998
I've got a bad feeling.

270
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,501
Luffy! You sure about this?

271
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,870
Go! Straight ahead!

272
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,471
Shouldn't we at least
go over the plan again

273
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,572
or something?

274
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:00,379
Hey! Hatchin!

275
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,915
Are you okay?

276
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,049
Hey, Macro!

277
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,351
Show yourself!

278
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,553
Give us Hachi back!

279
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,227
That's their flag!

280
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,629
It really is the Straw Hats!

281
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,364
I gotta get outta here!

282
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,573
Damn. It's no use. I'm stuck!

283
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,208
That leaves me no choice!

284
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,077
Hachi Ink Jet!

285
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,351
Am I seeing things,
or is something in that cage?

286
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,486
What the hell?

287
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,388
Some kinda black thing.

288
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,557
Wait a second.

289
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,259
Is that...

290
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,395
It kinda looks like Hatchin.

291
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,966
Oh, wow!
We're in luck, Camie!

292
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,968
There isn't a
single enemy in sight!

293
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,404
Maybe they all decided that
this is snacktime or something!

294
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,338
Probably.

295
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,440
You two cannot
seriously be this stupid!

296
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,176
The blindest man in the world
could see that this is a trap!

297
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,578
They're totally hiding out,

298
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,315
waiting for us to investigate
so they can ambush us.

299
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,383
What a brilliant deduction!

300
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,351
That's genius!

301
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,986
I never would've
thought of that!

302
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,422
That's why you dumbasses
keep getting caught!

303
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,357
[HACHI]
Nyuu! I'm here, Camie!

304
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,327
I'm fine! There's no
need to worry, okay?

305
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,228
Hatchin!

306
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,996
It really is you!

307
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,571
What happened?

308
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,939
You're all black!

309
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,175
Uh, well,
they didn't do that.

310
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,676
It's my own fault, actually.

311
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,144
Anyway, this is a trap!

312
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,679
Get outta here
before they catch you!

313
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,215
Don't worry!
I can take care of myself!

314
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,451
I'll be okay, so just go!

315
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,288
There's something
about that guy's voice

316
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,090
that seems really familiar.

317
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,025
You noticed it, too, right?

318
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,327
Uh huh. His shape, too.

319
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,562
Yeah. I know who he is.

320
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,663
You do?

321
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,232
Let's just ask him and
get this over with already.

322
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,969
Hey, you! So how's
Arlong doing these days?

323
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,205
Oh! Not so good, actually.

324
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,142
Him, Choo, Kuroobi, and all the
others got caught by the Navy!

325
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,077
I was the only one who escaped!

326
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,612
Now I've given up
my life of crime

327
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,714
and I'm running
an octopus fritter shop!

328
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,050
Funny how time flies, right?

329
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,324
Arlong?

330
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,992
What an idiot.

331
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:31,931
[LUFFY]
It's you!

332
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,400
The dumb squid with the swords!

333
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,937
They tricked me!

334
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,501
Damn it all!

335
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:01,669
[LUFFY]
I'm right, aren't I?

336
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,570
You were one of Arlong's crew!

337
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,506
You're the octopus fritter guy?

338
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,274
What kinda crap is that?

339
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:08,475
Arlong?

340
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,578
Yeah. It was a
really long time ago.

341
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,380
Nami's hometown
of Cocoyashi Village

342
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:15,749
used to be under the control
of a nasty bunch of fishmen

343
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,085
called the Arlong Pirates.

344
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:20,120
Nami herself was in an
even worse situation

345
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,755
having to work for those jerks.

346
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:25,592
And this octopus guy, Hachi, was
one of Arlong's top henchmen.

347
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:28,762
[ARLONG laughing]

348
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:29,697
Hey, now.

349
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,598
You're not gonna run
out on me, are you?

350
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:32,733
Listen, little girl.

351
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:36,170
If you do that, I'll kill
everyone in that village.

352
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,138
Do you understand me?

353
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,340
Good.

354
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,181
Now which one
of you is Arlong?

355
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,222
Oh. So he's
an old enemy, huh?

356
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,090
Well, he was.

357
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,258
But Luffy and I,
mainly me, came along

358
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,594
and beat the crap outta every
last one of those guys!

359
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:01,795
Oh, wow!

360
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,564
Usopp, you're amazing!

361
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,532
Yeah. I know, right?

362
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,800
After we left the village,

363
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:10,104
I thought their whole crew was
gonna get arrested by the Navy.

364
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:13,040
But it looks like this guy
left them behind and escaped.

365
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:17,544
I see. Sounds like
quite the ordeal.

366
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,546
Listen up,
you dumb jerk fish!

367
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,414
Now that we know it's you,

368
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,249
there's no way
we're gonna save you,

369
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,851
so you better get
used to that cage.

370
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,519
Nyuu...

371
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:29,757
But... Well...

372
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:34,261
Uhm, y'know, um...

373
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,463
Just asking, but are
your octopus fritters

374
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:39,099
as yummy as everyone
says they are?

375
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,167
Why don't you
think with your head

376
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,535
instead of your stomach?

377
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,137
What a moron.

378
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,104
Hey, wait a second!

379
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,340
Does this mean that
you guys know Hatchin?

380
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,809
He must be like an old
friend of yours or something!

381
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:51,545
He's not our friend at all! No!

382
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,383
[USOPP]
Turn the ship around!

383
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,119
Namichin...

384
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:00,554
Sorry, we can't help you.

385
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,822
I know we said "yes" at first,

386
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,591
but we didn't know this was the
"friend" you were talking about.

387
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,560
Oh, come on!

388
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:10,297
You can't just leave him like
this after coming all this way!

389
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,465
Please!

390
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:12,866
[HACHI]
Don't worry about it, Camie!

391
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,535
Just leave, okay?

392
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:16,136
This is a trap!

393
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,538
This sucks.

394
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:18,605
Fine, then!

395
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,441
I'll have to do it!

396
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,276
Hatchin!
You're always saving me,

397
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,678
so now's my chance
to return the favor!

398
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,546
Pappagu?

399
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,181
[PAPPAGU]
I'm in!

400
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:29,316
I never would've thought
you guys would turn out to be

401
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,385
such a bunch of
heartless morons!

402
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,420
Morons! Morons!

403
00:18:33,454 --> 00:18:34,688
Oh, shut up!

404
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:36,490
Just hang on, Hachi!

405
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:39,626
[CAMIE] I promise you, we won't
leave this place without you!

406
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,761
--Here we come!
--Here we come!

407
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,263
No! Wait!

408
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:44,765
Just let 'em go!

409
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:49,169
Do you think
they're gonna be okay?

410
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:50,804
Yeah. I'm sure
they have a plan.

411
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,574
They wouldn't have just
charged in there without one.

412
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,578
[MACRO] We've got you now,
Camie! Muhahaha!

413
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:58,612
You've gotta
be kidding me!

414
00:18:58,645 --> 00:18:59,847
That's just pathetic!

415
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,714
Muhaha!

416
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:02,850
Now we're all
gonna be filthy rich!

417
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,284
Especially since the only guy

418
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,352
who ever saves you can't!

419
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,688
You're not gonna escape
from us this time, Camie.

420
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:08,388
It's over.

421
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:13,360
[CAMIE yelling]

422
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,761
Why didn't you just run away?

423
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,531
Camie! Pappagu!

424
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,601
[SANJI] Bastards!
Camie hasn't done anything!

425
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,736
Sanji. Hold on a second, okay?

426
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,546
Camie! I'm still
gonna save you! 'Kay?

427
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:45,392
All right.

428
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,561
We might as well
save him after all.

429
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:50,264
Hachi isn't all that bad.

430
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:52,232
I'd go so far as
to say he's harmless.

431
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,601
I'm not gonna hold a grudge,
and besides,

432
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:57,604
we promised Camie
we'd help her, didn't we?

433
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,673
Oh, Nami!

434
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:02,476
I love when you're firm, but I
love when you're forgiving, too!

435
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:03,677
[USOPP]
Are you sure, Nami?

436
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,012
[ZORO]
It's really okay?

437
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,648
[NAMI]
Yep! Right, Luffy?

438
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,751
[LUFFY] If you say
it's okay, it's okay.

439
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:12,319
We'll save the octopus.

440
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:15,689
Look! His eyes
are octopus fritters!

441
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,541
[DUVAL] Are the
preparations in order...

442
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,879
...Flying Fish Riders?

443
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,359
[FISH RIDERS] Of course!
We're always ready!

444
00:20:52,392 --> 00:20:56,930
Time for Gum Gum Pistol!

445
00:20:57,531 --> 00:20:58,999
You leave them alone!

446
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,704
He's got Devil Fruit Powers!

447
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:06,373
[HACHI]
Straw Hat?

448
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,344
Damn! That little punk!

449
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:11,411
Thank you, Luffy!

450
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:12,679
You saved us!

451
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:15,749
Yeah! I got 'em, Octopus!

452
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:17,618
Thank you, Straw Hat!

453
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,453
You have my most
sincere gratitude

454
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,754
for saving little Camie.

455
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:21,722
I owe you one!

456
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:22,689
Hey!

457
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:25,626
Cut up the octopus' cage
and untie him, Zoro!

458
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,995
Right!

459
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:29,529
Be careful, Straw Hat!

460
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,365
The trap is still set!

461
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,700
The Flying Fish Riders
have got you surrounded!

462
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,736
They'll take you down
any way they can.

463
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,704
Don't let your guard down!

464
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:41,842
[DUVAL]
Now, attack!

465
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,876
[FISH RIDERS]
Sir!

466
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,916
You're the greatest!

467
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,952
I don't care if they
come from the sea or sky.

468
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:53,654
We'll be ready.

469
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,956
We're gonna beat
the crap out of 'em.

470
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:00,027
[LUFFY]
Listen up, you guys!

471
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:14,675
[LUFFY]
Time to fight!

472
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,644
[ALL]
Yeah!

473
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:20,681
Dammit!

474
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,015
Quick, while we
still have the chance!

475
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,651
Come on, let's
go get Camie back!

476
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:25,819
[GYARO and TANSUI]
Yeah!

477
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:27,020
Camie! Pappagu!

478
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,021
It's dangerous here!

479
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,589
You need to stand back!

480
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:30,557
Nyuu?

481
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,092
--Go, Luffy!
--Get him!

482
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,593
--Get him back!
--Get him!

483
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:34,394
Go!

484
00:22:34,428 --> 00:22:36,463
Bring it, you
dumb Flying Fish!

485
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:38,799
Go! Go!
Get him back!

486
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:46,473
Guys, they're here!

487
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:47,507
[CHOPPER, ZORO, SANJI]
Right!

488
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,008
[DUVAL] I've finally found you,
Black Leg Sanji!

489
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,844
[LUFFY] Hey,
how does he know Sanji?

490
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:25,479
[DUVAL]
You're the one!

491
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,781
It's your fault
my life was ruined!

492
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:29,483
[USOPP] Whoa! He really
hates him, doesn't he?

493
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:31,017
[DUVAL]
I'm sending you to hell!

494
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:33,653
[LUFFY and USOPP]
What did you do, Sanji?

495
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:35,122
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

496
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:35,956
"Tragedy!

497
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:38,525
The Truth Hidden
Under Duval's Mask!"

498
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:41,061
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
