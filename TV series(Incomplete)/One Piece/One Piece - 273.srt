1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,571
It's the One Piece
treasure giveaway!

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,373
The first key letter to be
on the lookout for is...

3
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,110
We'll tell you how to enter
at the end of the show!

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,213
Look!

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:13,881
We're headed straight
for a dead end!

6
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,450
He'll crash into it and die!

7
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,418
Gomorrah! Stop it!

8
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,254
You'll never make it! Stop!

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,157
A dead end?

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,792
I don't see one. Do you?

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:28,695
Nope. Can't say
I see anything of the sort.

12
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,921
All units!

13
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:57,291
The King Bull carrying the
pirates broke through Block D

14
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,593
and they are now at the
Courthouse Plaza!

15
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,466
All personnel on
Enies Lobby's Main Island!

16
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:09,135
Head to the Courthouse
Plaza immediately!

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,740
I repeat: The pirates have
reached the Courthouse Plaza!

18
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,576
Huh?

19
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,045
Also, the gatekeepers of the
Main Island Front Gate,

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,581
Oimo and Kashii, have
joined up with the pirates!

21
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,617
They're currently destroying the
central part of the Main Island!

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,619
Get outta the way!

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,257
Our guard casualties total
must be over 2,000 men!

24
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,294
And the man who took down
over a thousand of those men

25
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,796
all by himself, the
notorious Straw Hat Luffy,

26
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,765
has suddenly disappeared!

27
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,133
We're still assessing
the situation here!

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,471
In the history of this island,
this is, without a doubt, the

29
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,141
absolute worst thing that has
ever happened at Enies Lobby!

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,713
What's happening here?

31
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,381
And why now?

32
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:58,685
What the hell's going on?

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,527
Jerk!

34
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,164
He's fast!

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,337
Finger Pistol! Shave!

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,772
Iron Body! Strong!

37
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,143
Now Gum Gum--

38
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,245
Bullet!

39
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,745
Iron Body!

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,351
Tempest Kick!

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,701
It's no good.

42
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,437
I can't stay like this.

43
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,106
It won't work.

44
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,775
When I lost to Aokiji,
I realized something.

45
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,711
I said to myself.

46
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,814
"You keep running into guys
that are stronger and stronger.

47
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,684
Unless you can
get stronger too,

48
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,752
you can't protect your friends."

49
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:10,057
And I want to; they're
not all strong like me.

50
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,127
But either way, they're my
friends and I wanna keep 'em.

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,096
So I have to get
stronger than anyone else,

52
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,799
otherwise there's a
chance I could lose 'em.

53
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,435
Then what are you gonna do?

54
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:25,038
I thought of a new way
to fight with all my might,

55
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,574
so that I won't lose anyone.

56
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,480
So I won't let anyone
slip away from me.

57
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,316
What's happening to him?

58
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,484
What's going on inside his body?

59
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,621
That did it.

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,459
You won't be able
to stop me now.

61
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,626
What?

62
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:51,464
All my strength and techniques
just went up by one step.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,735
Second Gear!

64
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,592
Baskerville!

65
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,494
Chief Justice Baskerville!

66
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,096
Come in! It's me!

67
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,065
Oh! Hello, Chief Spandam!

68
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,201
This is Left Baskerville
on the left!

69
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,136
This is Right Baskerville
on the right.

70
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,604
And located in the center,

71
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,275
it is none other than I--Central
Freeway, closed for repairs!

72
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,676
Shut up!

73
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,645
Just give me a
status report, damn it!

74
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,546
Is it true that the
intruders have made it

75
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,615
to the courthouse plaza or not?

76
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,183
Let's see.

77
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,052
A status report, huh?

78
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,557
That's a tricky one.

79
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,226
They're not so much in the plaza

80
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,561
as they are inside
the courthouse.

81
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,196
It's just awful!

82
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,464
What?

83
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:44,905
Chief!

84
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,639
Chief Justice!

85
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,573
I have a report!

86
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,310
The pirates have cut
through our defenses

87
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,345
and broken down the front door.

88
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:54,248
They're currently
inside the courthouse.

89
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,083
We can see that already, fool!

90
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,519
Not as much resistance
as I expected.

91
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,720
We should be able
to tear right through.

92
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,622
Wait, what's that?

93
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,760
Whoa, what? He's got 3 heads!

94
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,130
He's just like that dog
that guards the underworld!

95
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:10,731
Berberus?

96
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,299
You mean "Cerberus"!

97
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,301
Order in the court, damn it!

98
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,137
This is a sacred chamber
of law, you hooligans!

99
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,640
You had the nerve to
burst in here so shut up,

100
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,376
sit still and receive
your sentence!

101
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,144
Gero!

102
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:29,083
All right guys, you head to the
roof and join up with Straw Hat.

103
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,185
We'll stay here at
the door with Yokozuna

104
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,053
and hold off the Marines.

105
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,154
We'll watch your back,

106
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,824
so keep moving and don't
worry about the small fries!

107
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:37,625
Gero!

108
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:38,492
You got it.

109
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,727
Hey, it looks
like they're starting

110
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,328
some kind of trial over there.

111
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,129
Hm?

112
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:42,629
Who cares?

113
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,697
Just ignore them.

114
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,632
Which way do we go?

115
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,332
Straight ahead!

116
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,368
There are stairs on both sides.

117
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,702
Let's make our way to the top!

118
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,237
Right.

119
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,904
Hey!

120
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,072
They're ignoring the trial!

121
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,006
I know they're pirates,

122
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,109
but seriously, how
rude can these guys get!

123
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,010
Bastards!

124
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,245
How dare you mock
the judicial island!

125
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,247
I'll teach you some respect!

126
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,588
Are his swords bending,
or am I seeing things?

127
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:12,092
Charming Demon.

128
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,461
Sleepless Night.

129
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,429
Onigiri!

130
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:27,240
Is he the guy
who broke the door?

131
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,644
Well, that's that.

132
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,079
Now let's get moving!

133
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,446
Right!

134
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,284
He puts all of us to shame

135
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,286
and he's not even the
captain of their crew!

136
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,088
Hey hey hey, wait!

137
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,289
Outta the way, reindeer!

138
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,390
Outta the way, Moss Head!

139
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,625
I'm coming through!

140
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,392
Hm?

141
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,161
I forgot about him.

142
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,363
Somebody's gotta protect Nami
from all of these bad guys

143
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,666
and that somebody's
gonna be me, damn it!

144
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,334
Now move!

145
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,068
Watch it!

146
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:54,768
What?

147
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,438
Why is he picking a fight now?

148
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,473
If you wanna settle
this, then bring it!

149
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,741
Shut up!

150
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,577
This is your fault for trying
to hog Nami all for yourself!

151
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,445
Follow me, Nami.

152
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,612
Forget about him.

153
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:10,751
Uh, hey, we came to this place
to rescue Robin, remember?

154
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,685
Oh!

155
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,454
I bet she's waiting for me!

156
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,456
She's waiting for
her prince to save her!

157
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,192
She's probably crying right now,
'cause she misses me so much!

158
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,360
Whatever!

159
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,529
Hm? Come on!

160
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,132
Are you kidding me?

161
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,233
Come back, Zoro!

162
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,701
That's the wrong way!

163
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,136
You sure?

164
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,203
How can you screw this up

165
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,373
when the stairs are right
in front of your face?

166
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,340
What's wrong with you?

167
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,276
If you'd stop giving
such crappy directions,

168
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,277
this wouldn't happen!

169
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,213
You are not blaming this on me!

170
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,315
Zoro, I'll try to make you some
medicine later,

171
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,550
to fix your brain problem.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,752
Brain problem?

173
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,586
Hey, Chopper?

174
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,453
Hm?

175
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:49,056
Make some for
him while you're at it.

176
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,625
I'll try, but he
may be beyond help.

177
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,595
I'm starting to have doubts
about this whole rescue thing.

178
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,597
They'll pull it together
when the going gets tough.

179
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,798
I'm sure.

180
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,767
I mean, probably.

181
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,068
I mean, hopefully.

182
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,738
These are serious crimes.

183
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,274
Yes, they're quite grave indeed.

184
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,445
But we should show restraint
and sentence them to death!

185
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,346
Agreed!

186
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,317
Are you still with us, Zoro?

187
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,318
It's this way!

188
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,518
Yeah, I know!

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,657
Think you can ignore
the Chief Justice, huh?

190
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,472
Chopper. Nami.

191
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,539
Go on ahead.

192
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,243
I'll make quick
work of this thing

193
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,811
and catch up with
you in a second.

194
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,712
Oh.

195
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm a "thing" now, am I?

196
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,482
And easy to defeat, no less?

197
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,518
I'll teach you the meaning
of fear, you little--

198
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,393
Pull!

199
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,364
No! Stop it!

200
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,067
Heave-ho!

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,671
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

202
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,573
Heave-ho!

203
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,708
No.

204
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,455
You gotta go through
us first, Cerberus!

205
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,390
Are you sure about this?

206
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,327
Curse you!

207
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,161
Let's go.

208
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,695
Uh, right!

209
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:46,806
Gear?

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,809
Your techniques have changed?

211
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:51,145
Are you supposed
to be a steam engine?

212
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,747
You certainly
are full of hot air.

213
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,483
You're starting to
test my patience.

214
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:09,330
You know, the truth is I'm
glad I met you guys when I did.

215
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,464
Hm?

216
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:15,602
Because thanks to you,
I won't ever lose my friends.

217
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,593
The truth is I'm glad
I met you guys when I did.

218
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,463
Because thanks to you,
I won't ever lose my friends.

219
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:44,832
I don't understand.

220
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,467
I think you've got it backwards.

221
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,303
Aren't you going to lose one
of your friends precisely

222
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,405
because you met us?

223
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,306
I knew you were foolish,

224
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,642
but now you're just
uttering nonsense.

225
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,710
You sure you didn't
hit your head?

226
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,447
Gum-Gum--

227
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,786
What, are you stopping to aim?

228
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:08,088
That only gives me
more time to dodge.

229
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,056
Fine.

230
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,159
Let's see how good
your aim is, then.

231
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:12,793
Shave!

232
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,561
Jet Pistol!

233
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,541
Rifle!

234
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,019
I can't see him at all!

235
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,491
Stamp!

236
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,028
And spear!

237
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,498
Missile!

238
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,709
Impossible.

239
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,650
No, it has to be.

240
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,687
The truth is I'm glad
I met you guys when I did.

241
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,623
He's using the Shave technique.

242
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:18,592
Only CP9 should
know the Six Powers,

243
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,727
but he's clearly mastered it.

244
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,331
Air Door!

245
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,104
Huh?

246
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,538
He disappeared.

247
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,414
This is unheard of.

248
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:43,217
A pirate commanding
one of our techniques?

249
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,085
With no training?

250
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,788
Besides that, he can
use it so effortlessly.

251
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:51,058
How was he able to
strengthen his body like that?

252
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,093
Is it because of that steam?

253
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,396
This is a sick joke.

254
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:59,666
Don't tell me he was
capable of this all along!

255
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,604
No, it doesn't matter.

256
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:07,341
No one can match the speed
of a true Six Powers master!

257
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,776
I won't lose to him!

258
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,315
If I turn his body parts
into doors like before,

259
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,584
that should stop him
dead in his tracks.

260
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:21,588
After that, all I have
to do is finish him off.

261
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,759
Door-Door!

262
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,233
When we fought before,

263
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,603
and it looked like
you were disappearing,

264
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,171
you were really
just moving your feet

265
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,773
ten or twenty times a second.

266
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,575
I got the hang of it, too.

267
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,344
But I never would've
figured something like that

268
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,678
out on my own.

269
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,514
Like I said, I really
am glad I met you guys.

270
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,483
When my friends are in trouble,

271
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,319
I'll be able to use your
tricks to protect them.

272
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,760
Gum-Gum--

273
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:03,597
I can take it.

274
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,199
I'll use my strongest defense!

275
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,436
Iron Body. Strength!

276
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,005
Jet Bazooka!

277
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:33,126
You sure are tough, aren't you?

278
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:35,696
All right then.

279
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,666
I was gonna save it, but
I have an even better trick.

280
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,367
Don't blink.

281
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,038
I call this--

282
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,796
Man, I'm beat.

283
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,498
Guess my body can't
keep this up for long.

284
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,703
Well, I don't care
about my body right now.

285
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,174
I need to move ahead.

286
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,450
Damn it! What's going on here?

287
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,052
Quick! Fire the cannons, men!

288
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,553
Before they step on us!

289
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,223
Yeah, nice try!

290
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,459
But those peashooters
aren't enough to stop me!

291
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,628
You can run or you
can fight, little men,

292
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,796
but we're comin'
through either way!

293
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,568
I see it and I still
can't believe it!

294
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,203
I don't know what
you said to those guys,

295
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,805
but it must've
been something else!

296
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:54,074
We warriors
understand each other!

297
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,377
The time has come, brothers!

298
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,046
The courthouse is
looming on the horizon.

299
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,447
Onward!

300
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:03,350
What're you doing?

301
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,653
Hurry up and go inside already!

302
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,755
The pirates are in the
courthouse, aren't they?

303
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,623
Yeah, but the problem
is there's a big frog

304
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,725
at the door and he's
not letting anyone in!

305
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,061
A frog?

306
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,796
Gero Gero Gero Gero
Gero Gero Gero Gero!

307
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,231
Keep fighting, Yokozuna!

308
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,166
Don't give 'em an inch!

309
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,167
Gero Gero Gero Gero Gero Gero!

310
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,635
We can't stop until the
drawbridge comes down!

311
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,504
If those guys break
our line of defense,

312
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,573
thousands of 'em
could pour in here!

313
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,407
Gero!

314
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,148
Only one of us
needs to get through!

315
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,816
Even if everyone else falls,

316
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,518
as long as someone
pulls that lever, we've won!

317
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,531
You okay, Sis?

318
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,499
Don't worry about me!

319
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,335
All that matters is
bringing down that bridge

320
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,271
and making sure the Straw Hats
get to the Tower of Law!

321
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:57,905
Hold it!

322
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,240
You're not going anywhere!

323
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:00,241
Oh yeah?

324
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,509
Try and stop me!

325
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:09,116
What are those pirates plotting?

326
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,452
Why's it so important
for them to go upstairs, huh?

327
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,790
You won't get
an answer outta me!

328
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,192
We'll see about that!

329
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,293
But I'll tell you one thing--

330
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,195
you're gonna pay
if you hurt our big bro!

331
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:25,799
After them!

332
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,202
Bring those pirates down!

333
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,303
How many of these stupid guards

334
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,105
are we gonna have to
beat before they catch a hint?

335
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:34,742
There they are!

336
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,743
Attack!

337
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,611
Move!

338
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,114
Hey, if you have to throw them,

339
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,715
at least don't throw them at me!

340
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,119
Guilty! Guilty!

341
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,420
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

342
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,588
Guilty! Guilty!

343
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:48,622
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

344
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,590
Would you guys shut up?

345
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,258
I'm trying to think here.

346
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,493
Must've taken a
wrong turn somewhere.

347
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,705
You want us to take
Franky and Nico Robin

348
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,373
to the Gates of Justice now?

349
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:06,807
Yes!

350
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,441
Do it!

351
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,375
Quickly!

352
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,610
But we're way ahead of schedule.

353
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,545
The escort ship
isn't even ready yet.

354
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,713
I don't care!

355
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,549
We can just wait for it on
the other side of the gates!

356
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:16,616
If we get rid of those two,

357
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,420
the pirates won't have
a reason to fight anymore!

358
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,121
There's no point in
risking another battle

359
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:24,291
with those monsters when we have
the power to end this right now!

360
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,262
And while you're at it, gather
all the members of CP9, too!

361
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,396
Sir!

362
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,268
Now.

363
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,604
It seems as if your
one-way trip to hell

364
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,772
will be departing
ahead of schedule.

365
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,208
Then, we'll have all
the time in the world

366
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,710
to deal with your friends!

367
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,324
Giant warriors! Giant warriors!

368
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,327
Giant warriors are on our side!

369
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,196
Giant warriors! Giant warriors!

370
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:05,599
Those pirates sure know how
to bring the party, don't they?

371
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,134
I don't know if they
have common sense,

372
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,470
but they sure as heck have guts!

373
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,572
Just you wait and
watch, Chimney.

374
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,808
In the end, whether they live
or die, that Straw Hat boy

375
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,477
and all of his little friends

376
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,446
are gonna shake things up
the whole world over.

377
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,614
In hundreds of years,

378
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,317
nobody's pulled a
stunt like this one!

379
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,255
Mark my words, when this battle
is over, every man, woman,

380
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:32,525
and child is gonna know
the name of Straw Hat Luffy!

381
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:45,205
Robin!

382
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,373
Yeah! He made it!

383
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,410
Luffy!

384
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:54,047
I'm here to save you!

385
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,629
How many times do
I have to tell you?

386
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,131
I'm not coming back!

387
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,533
I don't want to see
your faces ever again!

388
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,601
Robin!

389
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:21,535
Do you hear me?

390
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,637
I just want to die!

391
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,740
Sorry! We're already here
and it was a lot of trouble!

392
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,143
So we're going to
go ahead and save you!

393
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,811
On the next One Piece:

394
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,248
"Give Us Your Answer, Robin!
The Straw Hats' Outcry!"

395
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:36,349
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
