Hi! [laughs]

179
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,455
[PIRATES scream]

180
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,926
So... What just happened?

181
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,127
You got me.

182
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,062
[gasps] Quick!
You've got to run!

183
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:48,664
If those guys come back
here with their buddies,

184
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:50,232
then they'll kill
you on the spot!

185
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,201
I don't care about that.
I'm hungry.

186
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:54,403
How can you just blow
this off like that?!

187
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:55,637
There are hundreds
of them up on deck

188
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:58,307
and they're waiting for the
opportunity to kill anything!

189
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,342
‐‐[LUFFY grunting]
‐‐[COBY groans]

190
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,379
[COBY mumbles]
You're going the wrong way!

191
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,614
No!

192
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,217
‐‐Wait!
‐‐[LUFFY growls]

193
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,284
[screams]

194
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,220
[laughs]

195
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,688
It's a goldmine!

196
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,256
Food! Food! Food! Food! Food!

197
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,524
‐‐[LUFFY laughing]
‐‐[COBY] Who's knows...

198
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,260
Maybe we'll be safe in here as
long as no one else gets hungry.

199
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,962
[LUFFY]
...box looks promising!

200
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,965
Apples! Excellent! [laughs]

201
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,466
Heh, tasty!

202
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,136
[COBY]
Uh... Hey! My name's Coby!

203
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,971
You're Luffy, is that right?

204
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,139
That was pretty neat when you

205
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,608
jumped out of that
barrel back there.

206
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,176
These are awesome!

207
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:37,446
[LUFFY] So are we on
a pirate ship or what?

208
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,547
[COBY]
No...

209
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,083
It's a passenger ship that's
being raided by pirates,

210
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:43,485
pirates under the
command of Lady Alvida.

211
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,620
[LUFFY]
Aw, who cares anyway?

212
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:47,656
What I wanna know is if
there are any boats on board.

213
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,424
[COBY]
I think there are a few.

214
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,261
[LUFFY] Great, 'cause mine got
sucked into some big whirlpool.

215
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,129
[COBY]
That one outside? No way!

216
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,598
No one could have survived that.

217
00:10:56,632 --> 00:11:00,269
[laughs] Yeah! I gotta say,
it was a big surprise!

218
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:01,136
[laughs nervously]

219
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,638
[LUFFY]
So are you one of the pirates

220
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:03,739
or one of the passangers?

221
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:04,973
[gasps]

222
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:12,648
[COBY] It was on a
fateful day, long ago...

223
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,016
That day...

224
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,717
I stepped out onto
a small fishing boat

225
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,353
on the outskirts of town
to go catch my dinner.

226
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,056
[gasps]

227
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:23,492
[COBY whimpers]

228
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,060
[COBY]
Turned out that particular boat

229
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:27,529
was actually headed
for a pirate ship.

230
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,997
That was two years ago.

231
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:32,100
[COBY] In exchange for
them letting me live,

232
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:34,736
I'm forced to live the
life of a cabin boy.

233
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,273
You're pretty stupid,
you know that?

234
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,375
[COBY]
Gee, thanks for your honesty.

235
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,610
If you hate it, then leave.

236
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,178
Are you kidding?!
I can't do that!

237
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,113
No way! Nuh‐huh! Not a chance!

238
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:46,481
Just the thought of
Alvida finding me

239
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,417
scares me so bad,
I wanna throw up.

240
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,519
[laughing] You're a
moron and a coward!

241
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,155
I hate people like you!

242
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:55,624
‐‐[LUFFY laughs]
‐‐[COBY sobs]

243
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,360
[ALVIDA] All right, quit your
lollygagging around, boys!

244
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:02,164
We gotta load up everything
before the Marines get here.

245
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:03,498
I catch anyone dawdling,

246
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:06,602
and they'll get a real
mouthful of my iron club!

247
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,470
[PIRATE I]
I love hitting a rich ship.

248
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:09,605
[PIRATE J]
Let's get back to it!

249
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:10,606
She'll break our asses

250
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,174
if she catches us slacking off.

251
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,642
[PIRATE H]
One hit from that club of hers

252
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,044
is enough to have you
beggin' for death! [laughs]

253
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:18,113
[PIRATES screaming]

254
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:19,581
[BOTH]
Captain!

255
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,449
[ALVIDA growls]

256
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:21,583
[BOTH]
This is bad!

257
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,118
[ALVIDA]
Yeah...? Then out with it!

258
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:24,653
[PIRATE M]
It came from inside the barrel!

259
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:26,622
[PIRATE C]
Such a horrible monster!

260
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:27,723
[ALVIDA growls]
Huh?

261
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:29,524
[PIRATES whimper]

262
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,560
[ALVIDA grunts]
Who are you...

263
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:32,294
‐‐[PIRATES scream]
‐‐[PIRATE B groans]

264
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,495
[ALVIDA]
...calling a monster?!

265
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,397
[PIRATE B screams]

266
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:39,167
[PIRATES scream]

267
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:43,839
Uh... we weren't... talkin'...
'bout... you, my lady.

268
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,375
Some guy was hiding in a barrel!

269
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:47,809
He could be a bounty hunter!

270
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,044
What?!

271
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:09,106
Yeah, you're right.

272
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,440
If I had the courage,

273
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,859
I could drift alone in a barrel
and be rid of these pirates.

274
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,962
I actually have my own dreams.

275
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:18,065
Some day... I'd like to
live out all of them.

276
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,667
So... What about you, Luffy?

277
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:23,136
What was it that first got you
to set sail on these seas?

278
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,037
[LUFFY]
Hm?

279
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,673
Well, I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!

280
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:29,943
[gasps]

281
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,078
‐‐The King?!
‐‐Yep.

282
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,846
‐‐Are you serious?
‐‐Yeah.

283
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,716
But... But that would mean
that you're a pirate, too!

284
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,750
Right.

285
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:37,718
Your crew?

286
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,353
Don't have one yet,
but I'm lookin' for 'em.

287
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:40,854
[COBY gasps]

288
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,128
[yelps] King of the Pirates
is a title given to one who

289
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,664
obtains everything this
world has to offer.

290
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,665
You're talking about seeking

291
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,434
the great treasure of
wealth, fame, and power.

292
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,837
The treasure that you
seek is the One Piece!

293
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,771
Yeah!

294
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,805
Yeah?! That's it?!

295
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,073
Pirates from all over the world

296
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,942
are looking for that
treasure, ya know?!

297
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:02,943
Yeah? So?

298
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,445
No way! It's impossible,
impossible, impossible!

299
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,713
There's no way anyone like you

300
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:09,016
could ever reach the pinnacle
during this great pirate age!

301
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,418
There's just too many out there
that are meaner and better!

302
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,153
[COBY yelps]

303
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,989
[COBY]
Ow... Why did you hit me?

304
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,224
'Cause I felt like it.

305
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,759
[COBY groans]

306
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,228
Oh, well... I'm used
to that stuff...

307
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,330
My shipmates smack
me around a lot...

308
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,865
...all the time, in fact.

309
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,433
It's not about if I can.

310
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,134
[COBY]
Huh?

311
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,770
I'm doing this 'cause I want to.

312
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,242
I decided long ago that I'm
gonna be King of the Pirates.

313
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,745
If I have to die fighting
for that... then I die.

314
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,481
[COBY gasps]

315
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:42,749
All right...

316
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:43,917
Now that my belly's full,

317
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,086
I'm gonna go get me
a brand new boat.

318
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,455
They might even just give me
one if I ask nice enough.

319
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,390
Maybe they're generous people.

320
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:52,793
I guess I never
thought of it like that.

321
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,495
[COBY]
If I put my mind to it,

322
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:59,332
if I'm prepared to die for it,
could I do something like that?

323
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,934
Like what?

324
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,469
[COBY]
Do you think...

325
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,739
Do you think I could
ever join the Marines?

326
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,506
[LUFFY]
Marines?

327
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,341
Yes! Catching bad guys is

328
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,444
the only thing I've
ever wanted to do!

329
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,913
It's been my dream
since I was a child!

330
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,481
Do you think I can do it?

331
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,515
How should I know that?

332
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,050
[COBY]
Then I'm gonna do it!

333
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,251
I'm not gonna get stuck here

334
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,187
as a cabin boy for
the rest of my life!

335
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,288
I'll break out,

336
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,057
then I'll turn right around,
and catch Alvida myself!

337
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:29,396
[screams]

338
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,966
[ALVIDA] Who is that you
plan on catching, Coby?

339
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,969
And you actually think
this twig is gonna help you?

340
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:36,937
Well?

341
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,839
‐‐[COBY whimpering]
‐‐[ALVIDA] Answer me!

342
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,509
[ALVIDA growls]

343
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,878
[COBY whimpers]

344
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,556
[ALVIDA chuckles]

345
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,259
My guess is that you're
not Zoro, the pirate hunter.

346
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,160
[COBY gasps]

347
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:00,861
Zoro?

348
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:01,995
‐‐[ALVIDA] Coby!
‐‐[screams]

349
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:05,532
[ALVIDA] Who is most beautiful

about him anyway?

<i>I had to find my way</i>
<i>to that place</i>

529
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:24,287
<i>Before someone could beat me</i>

530
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,991
<i>The promised land</i>
<i>was in my grasp</i>

531
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:31,461
<i>And I wouldn't let go</i>

532
00:23:34,097 --> 00:23:36,132
<i>My only dream...</i>

533
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:45,508
<i>I won't stop chasing it</i>
<i>until it comes true</i>

534
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:48,945
<i>But if the world ever changes</i>

535
00:23:48,978 --> 00:23:52,815
<i>I'll call out your name</i>

536
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,852
<i>We could return to the time</i>

537
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:59,822
<i>When everything's the same</i>

538
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,026
<i>As long as I'm with you</i>

539
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,930
<i>My memories won't fade</i>

540
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:13,102
<i>Waiting for that</i>
<i>one true dream...♪</i>

541
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,241
[LUFFY]
Tell you what.

542
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:20,343
I untie your ropes,
you join up with me.

543
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,045
I refuse to team
up with a pirate!

544
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,279
[LUFFY]
Come on!

545
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:25,214
Everybody already thinks of
you as an evil bounty hunter.

546
00:24:25,248 --> 00:24:26,282
[ZORO]
Screw that!

547
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:28,451
I've never done anything
I regret and I never will!

548
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,253
So I'm not gonna be a pirate!

549
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:32,455
[LUFFY] I already decided
that you're joining me.

550
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:34,991
[ZORO] Would you stop
making decisions for me?!

551
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,826
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

552
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,897
"Enter the Great Swordsman!
Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro!"

553
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,899
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
