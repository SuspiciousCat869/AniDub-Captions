00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.515
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.420
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:45.565
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.969
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.376
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.280
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.313 --> 00:02:55.785
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:58.558
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.899
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.401
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:08.544
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.919
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.196
[NARRATOR] In order to defeat
one of the Four Emperors,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.099
the Straw Hats formed
an alliance with Law,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.442
intending to destroy a Devil
Fruit Factory in Dressrosa.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.481
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.354
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.491
[NARRATOR]
As the Straw Hats do battle with

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:34.796
the fierce fighters of
the Don Quixote Family,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.967
Luffy and Law rush
to the royal palace

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.873
to take down Doflamingo himself.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:43.681
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Zoro has
his hands full with Pica.

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:47.722
Dressrosa belongs to
the Don Quixote Family!

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.334
Gutless bastard!
He's trying to kill the king!

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:01.650
[MARINES scream]

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.008
I've got your back,
Riku, my friend.

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.045
[ZORO]
Hey! King Punch Guy!

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:21.322
[ELIZABELLO]
Well?

00:04:21.355 --> 00:04:23.560
[ZORO]
Give me two minutes.

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.816
[PICA]
King Riku, you there?

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:46.640
[ZORO] Plan 5. Fly in
the sky and chop him up!

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:51.015
Yep, that's the one.

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:59.532
[LUFFY]
"A Decisive Battle in Midair!

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.939
Zoro's New Special
Secret Technique Blasts!"

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.812
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:45.123
[screams]

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.662
[BOTH scream]

00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:00.454
This looks dire!

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:01.990
Grandfather's up there!

00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:06.700
Mr. Sniper King! Just run away!

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:20.895
Hey, Pirate Hunter!
Don't make me wait too long!

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:22.632
[ZORO]
Yo, Two-by-Four!

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:25.070
If you mean "Commodore,"
that's me!

00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:27.341
[ZORO] Yeah, whatever.
You're the guy that threw

00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:29.344
that other guy like
a cannonball, right?

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.914
Huh?

00:06:33.052 --> 00:06:36.559
Get smashed like a bug, Riku!

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.634
[chuckles]

00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:46.547
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATES]
Yeah! Go, Pica!

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.349
[DON QUIXOTE PIRATE 719A]
Whatcha waiting for?

00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:51.990
We wanna see
their bones shatter!

00:06:54.194 --> 00:06:55.764
Stop him, men!

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:57.702
Open fire!

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.816
[PICA]
Huh?

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.720
[MARINES gasp]

00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:10.194
[MARINE 719A]
R-Retreat!

00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:12.097
[MARINE 719B]
Run!

00:07:15.003 --> 00:07:20.213
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:35.878
Halt, Pica!

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.958
It is I you want! Face me!

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:46.800
Do not put my people through
any more needless havoc!

00:07:50.273 --> 00:07:52.845
Quickly! Lead them away.

00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:54.783
[TANK]
Yes, sir! Everybody!

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:59.224
It's time to flee!
You must get off the plateau!

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:14.154
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:29.585
Everyone has exited!
It's your turn now!

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:35.230
Father! Hurry up!

00:08:35.263 --> 00:08:37.268
Viola! And Tank!

00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:39.138
Lead everyone to safety!

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:42.410
He's only after me! Just go!

00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:44.015
You don't have to do this.

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:46.687
King Riku! Come with us!

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.093
I can't. This may be
the only opportunity.

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:54.669
I am at peace with
my choice. Now go, Tank.

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:00.246
Is there no other way?

00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.259
How sweet! Well, if that's
what you really want,

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:08.597
I won't complain!

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:10.868
[chuckles]

00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:22.892
[cries] His hand is like
the size of an entire city!

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.844
What the hell?

00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:50.848
Pirate Hunter? Orlumbus?

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:52.050
What are you two plotting?

00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:54.354
You're certain
you wish to do this?

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:57.895
This technique is not meant
for throwing someone safely.

00:09:57.928 --> 00:10:00.433
C'mon, Carnivore. Just throw me!

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:06.078
[laughs] I'm gonna flatten the
plateau and you along with it!

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:13.159
[ALL scream]

00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:21.843
That bastard!

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.649
He's only going after
those who won't fight back.

00:10:24.683 --> 00:10:25.985
You ready?

00:10:26.018 --> 00:10:27.153
Yeah!

00:10:31.563 --> 00:10:35.938
[ORLUMBUS grunting]

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:42.552
[PICA]
Riku! You're no king!

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:46.091
You're not cut out
to lead anyone!

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:51.903
Commodore...

00:11:02.124 --> 00:11:03.426
Huh?

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:04.829
[PICA]
Huh?

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:11.910
If you won't run,
neither will we!

00:11:11.943 --> 00:11:13.848
We stand with King Riku!

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:21.094
[TOWNSPEOPLE shouting]

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:30.981
[PICA] Aww, Riku!
Did your sheep forgive you

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:34.487
for that decade-long
misunderstanding?

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:39.498
[DOLDO]
What are you all doing here?

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.235
Get out while you can!

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:46.780
[TOWNSPEOPLE shouting]

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:51.055
[laughs] What a joke!

00:11:51.088 --> 00:11:54.862
How's a pacifist like you
gonna protect your kingdom?

00:11:54.895 --> 00:12:00.106
You couldn't even save
your own reputation, Riku!

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:04.516
A kingdom's strength
lies in its military might!

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:08.857
You know nothing
about true authority!

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.628
I'll crush you!

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.497
I'll crush it all!

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:16.405
Die! King Riku!

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:23.452
[screams] The town is
gonna pulverize me!

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:28.730
[TOWNSPEOPLE gasping]

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:33.472
[ORLUMBUS]
Killer... Bowling!

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.105
[DOLDO]
What you say is true!

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:08.409
I failed to protect my kingdom.

00:13:08.442 --> 00:13:11.449
I will never sit upon
that throne again!

00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:16.058
[TOWNSPEOPLE shouting]

00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:22.538
However. To the bitter end,
I will remain true!

00:13:31.857 --> 00:13:35.263
Nine mountains and
eight seas make one world!

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:39.271
[ZORO] One thousand worlds
make one chiliocosm!

00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:42.511
One chiliocosm to
the power of three.

00:13:42.544 --> 00:13:45.249
And there's nothing I can't cut!

00:13:47.855 --> 00:13:51.362
[ZORO] Three-Sword Style
Secret Technique!

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.667
Are you naive, or what?

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.904
If the only means
for me to survive

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:58.910
is becoming a
cold-blooded killer,

00:13:58.943 --> 00:14:01.749
then I fearlessly choose death!

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:04.855
There is no future for
a nation of slaughter!

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:08.530
King Riku! We all proudly
stand behind you!

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:13.907
[laughs] Why do you think
so many do-gooders

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:16.478
are lost to history?

00:14:16.512 --> 00:14:20.721
They always die off before
leaving a mark on the world!

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:23.626
[screams]

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:47.073
The Billion-fold World...
Trichiliocosm!

00:15:00.534 --> 00:15:02.771
[screams]

00:15:02.805 --> 00:15:08.081
[ALL gasp]

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.530
[ZORO]
Good! He's in the top half.

00:15:48.563 --> 00:15:50.199
Roronoa!

00:16:00.587 --> 00:16:04.896
[PICA gasps]

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:06.833
[VIOLET gasps]

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.070
[BOTH gasp]

00:16:12.443 --> 00:16:16.652
[gasps] Go, Zoro!

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:28.610
[ZORO]
Dead stones. Moving stones.

00:16:28.643 --> 00:16:30.781
It seems like his real
body is shifting to

00:16:30.814 --> 00:16:32.718
one of the newly sliced pieces.

00:16:32.752 --> 00:16:38.730
And every time I split him,
the other side dies off.

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:59.404
[BOTH gasping]

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:17.708
[ZORO] As long as he's up here,
he can't burrow in the ground.

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:21.816
Come on out, Pica!

00:17:33.306 --> 00:17:36.311
How long ya' gonna
keep hiding from me?

00:17:38.817 --> 00:17:41.789
[PICA]
So, by cornering me...

00:17:41.822 --> 00:17:43.860
...you must think you've won!

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.410
You've got it all figured out?

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:55.817
Just cut some stones
and you can defeat me, huh?

00:17:55.851 --> 00:18:00.259
Well, good luck cutting
through my Haki, you moron!

00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:05.737
A Haki user?

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:07.642
Once I pound you
into the ground,

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:10.212
it's all over for you!

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.655
[ZORO]
Heh. That's bold.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:18.530
You must really think that
your Haki can out power mine.

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:20.634
[PICA]
Of course mine's stronger!

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:24.340
When will you learn
you're no match for me?!

00:18:25.142 --> 00:18:27.146
[ZORO chuckles]

00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:35.329
[ZORO] I used to be
as short-sighted as you.

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:37.199
Huh?

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:42.644
You wouldn't kill a fly
with a cannon, would you?

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:45.951
This should be
more than adequate.

00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:48.488
[ZORO]
Oni Giri!

00:18:52.129 --> 00:18:53.399
[ZORO]
Huh?

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:56.773
There's no way our skills
are this far apart!

00:18:56.806 --> 00:18:58.743
This can't be happening!

00:18:58.776 --> 00:18:59.878
[ZORO groans]

00:19:02.951 --> 00:19:05.322
[MIHAWK]
Why not retreat?

00:19:07.427 --> 00:19:10.266
I'd rather die than give up!

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:14.508
I see. State your name.

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:18.683
Roronoa Zoro!

00:19:22.123 --> 00:19:23.594
[MIHAWK]
I'll remember it.

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:27.367
I've not seen your
strength in some time.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.540
So, as swordsman's courtesy,

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:35.182
you shall perish to the
world's finest black blade.

[ZORO]
Three Thousand Worlds!

00:19:57.127 --> 00:19:58.729
[ZORO]
I've lost.

00:20:04.509 --> 00:20:09.383
[ZORO] Never in my life
did I imagine I'd lose.

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:16.231
[MIHAWK] It's still far
too early for you to die.

00:20:16.265 --> 00:20:19.973
My name is Hawkeye Mihawk!

00:20:20.006 --> 00:20:21.108
You're quite remarkable,

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:22.978
but there is much
for you to learn.

00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:24.815
Hone your skills!

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.457
[MIHAWK] Then seek me out!
Roronoa Zoro!

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:32.430
I don't have any more
time to waste

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:34.367
on a pebble like you!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.740
Take that back!

00:20:36.773 --> 00:20:38.910
[yells]

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:43.318

Rot in hell, Roronoa Zoro!

00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:50.633
[ZORO]
Three Thousand Worlds!

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.614
Now quit pickin' on
the innocent, will ya?

00:20:58.348 --> 00:21:00.720
What an upstanding guy! Wow!

00:21:00.754 --> 00:21:03.793
Ahh! Zoro!

00:21:18.155 --> 00:21:20.393
[BOTH cheer]

00:21:20.426 --> 00:21:22.564
He really did it!

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:26.539
It's over. He saved
my friend, Riku!

00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:32.249
Huh? [screams]

00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:35.422
Oh crap! His remains
are still falling!

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:38.195
We're all gonna die!

00:21:38.229 --> 00:21:40.299
[TOWNSPEOPLE scream]

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:44.340
Rescue me. Zoro!

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.056
[screaming]

00:21:53.325 --> 00:21:55.395
[ZORO]
That's your cue!

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:05.082
All right! King Punch!

00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:37.379
[sighs] That was close.

00:22:37.413 --> 00:22:39.585
[screams]

00:22:41.021 --> 00:22:46.130
[pants] How dare you.

00:22:46.164 --> 00:22:49.572
Tricking me into using the
King Punch for custodial labor?

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:53.045
You'll regret this,
you disrespectful punk!

00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:55.550
[ORLUMBUS laughs]

00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.764
That settles that.

00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:16.024
[NARRATOR]
After the fall of Pica,

00:23:16.057 --> 00:23:18.028
a top Don Quixote Executive,

00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:19.698
only two targets remain!

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.969
However, Luffy has his
hands full with Bellamy,

00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:25.042
who refuses to back down
as a matter of pride.

00:23:25.075 --> 00:23:27.581
Running out of patience,
Luffy must make a decision

00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:30.753
so he can finally face off
against Doflamingo.

00:23:30.787 --> 00:23:32.524
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:35.664
"So Long!
Bellamy's Farewell Blow!"

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:38.836
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
