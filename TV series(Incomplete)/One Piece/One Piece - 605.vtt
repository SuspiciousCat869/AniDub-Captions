00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.693
A captain now, huh?

00:14:20.726 --> 00:14:23.729
What's wrong?
Don't want to fight me?

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:29.001
No. Get the hell out of here.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:34.106
[BROOK] Yes, ma'am! Right away!
You have our thanks!

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.245
[MARINES]
Get back here!

00:14:39.278 --> 00:14:40.546
Stop, G-5!

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:43.249
We don't have the time
to be fighting right now.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.784
Head for the back
passage immediately!

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:46.919
[MARINES]
Huh?

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:49.321
The only way out of this
building's about to be sealed.

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.056
We need to get out now.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.791
Caesar's ordered
the gate closed.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.094
He's trying to fence us in.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.163
This is our chance to escape.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:01.033
If we don't make it out,
we'll be stuck on Punk Hazard.

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.534
Move fast or we die!

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.203
[MARINES]
No way!

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:05.537
[NAMI]
Huh?

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.139
Quick! Let's get moving.

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:08.774
You all heard the captain!

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.843
If we don't do as
she says, we're dead!

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.879
Come on, let's go!

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.047
Hurry up!

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.282
[MARINE BB]
Straight for the gate!

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.584
Don't stop for anything!

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:20.886
[MARINES yelling]

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:26.926
[siren blaring]

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:37.236
[ALL panting]

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.810
Well, that's taken care of.

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.912
Hey, where'd you run off to?

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.314
You're back!

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:52.251
Yes. Luffy asked me to do
a little favor for him.

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.787
You heard her, right?
The Navy captain.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.089
Pick up the pace, Brownie.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:58.657
We need to get out of here now!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:02.995
That's impossible.
I can't go any faster!

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:07.333
[KIN'EMON] Ha! I'm sick to
death of all this running!

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.567
[ZORO]
What, you tired?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.768
No!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.138
[BROOK] I'm not a samurai,
so I have no problem saying it.

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:16.108
I'm tired!

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.910
Look! What the hell's
Brownbeard doing

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.812
helping out those pirates?

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:20.946
[SUBORDINATE M]
That bastard!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.382
How could he even think
of betraying the Master?

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.451
[SUBORDINATE N] He's a traitor
to the great savior!

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.719
[SUBORDINATE M]
We'll figure it out later.

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:27.853
For now, we need to hurry!

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:33.826
[SUBORDINATES panting]

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:37.396
[MARINE DD] Come on, G-5!
We need to move faster!

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:41.400
[TASHIGI] The gate isn't
far now, men! Just keep running!

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:43.302
[MARINE BB]
It's gonna close any minute!

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:45.904
[MARINE DD]
Come on, come on!

00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:48.941
[OPERATOR A]
Experiment Cannon, stand by.

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:55.047
[CAESAR CLOWN cackling]

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:05.524
[OPERATOR A]
Target: Third Laboratory.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:08.160
Outer wall of Building A.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.776
[siren blaring]

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.344
[OPERATOR A]
Fire!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.450
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:17:31.483 --> 00:17:34.086
[MARINE X]
The wall's been breached!

00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:38.724
Hey, wait, that means...

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.898
You have got to be kidding me!

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:58.343
[MARINES gasp]

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.245
[MARINE GG]
Quick! Run!

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:08.220
[NAMI, USOPP]
Hm?

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.423
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

00:18:11.457 --> 00:18:12.925
What? What's wrong?

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.460
[BOTH scream]

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.994
Hurry!

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:21.233
[NAMI, USOPP] Go, Brownie!
Faster, faster! We're gonna die!

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:24.303
[USOPP]
Almost there now! You can do it!

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:30.476
[SMOKER] Go, Tashigi.
Help those fools escape.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.578
The children, too.

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.951
[TASHIGI] Go, and don't
look back! Move it!

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.353
I've got this.

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.255
Come on, Captain!

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:52.931
[MARINE II gasps]
Help me!

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.166
[MARINE QQ]
Hey!

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.535
Just reach!

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:58.937
[gasps]

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.181
[siren blaring]

00:19:09.214 --> 00:19:11.583
[MARINE RR]
It'll close any second now.

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:14.553
[MARINE SS] Anyone left
on this side will be a goner!

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:16.722
[MARINES panting]

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:20.659
[NAMI, USOPP]
Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:24.730
[USOPP screaming]

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.166
[BROWNBEARD]
Hang on, everybody!

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:30.435
[NAMI, USOPP scream]

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:33.005
[BROOK yells]

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:40.812
[USOPP, NAMI screaming]

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.714
Hey! We're through!

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.949
Yes, we are.

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:46.785
[BROOK laughs]
Just barely!

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:50.389
[MARINE JJ]
Wait! Where's the captain?

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:51.323
[MARINE KK]
I don't know!

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.458
She told us to go ahead
and not look back.

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:54.426
[MARINE JJ]
Huh?

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:55.994
[TASHIGI]
Don't stop! Keep running

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.396
straight through the gate!

00:19:57.429 --> 00:20:01.333
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.902
[MARINES chuckle]

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.838
[gasps] What are you doing?

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.407
Stop this! Put me down!

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.008
Not happening! Nope!

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:11.210
We've got you now!

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.145
[MARINE MM, LL] Yeah, we're not
gonna let our captain die!

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.279
[gasps]

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:15.414
[MARINES]
Goodbye!

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:18.884
[TASHIGI screams]

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:21.787
Hey! Captain just came
flying in through the gate!

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.921
[MARINE PP]
What's going on?

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:26.258
Glad you're safe.
But, how did you get here?

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.626
[TASHIGI]
Move out of my way!

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:29.995
There are still
marines out there!

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:31.897
I'm sorry!
It's way too dangerous!

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:33.532
[TASHIGI]
The gate is almost closed now!

00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:35.200
I can't just leave them behind!

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:38.170
Let go of me! They're still
out there! I have to help them!

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:39.771
[MARINE NN]
You can't go out there!

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:40.939
You'll never make it.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:41.773
[PIKE gasps]

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:42.908
No!

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.576
I have to save them.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.778
Smoker told me.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:48.647
He told me to
look out for the men!

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.816
Please! Just let me go!

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:53.151
[PIKE]
There isn't any time!

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.553
Are you all out of your minds?

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.022
Our men are in trouble, and we
need to get them to safety.

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:59.758
Now, I'm ordering you
to get out of my way!

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.159
[PIKE]
Sorry, Captain!

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:03.095
That's an order I can't follow.

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:04.730
[TASHIGI gasps]

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:07.099
Excellent, marines!

00:21:07.132 --> 00:21:10.102
Our captain is safe.
You've done the Navy proud.

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:13.105
Thank you!
We'll take it from here.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.014
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]
Those scum!

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:59.618
I can't believe
so many of them survived!

00:22:02.287 --> 00:22:04.489
[CAESAR CLOWN]
But nobody else will!

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.159
The rest of you are mine!

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:11.930
[CAESAR CLOWN cackles]

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.471
[NARRATOR] Immediately after
passing through the gate,

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:23.275
the G-5 soldiers are brutally
attacked by the notorious Vergo,

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:25.610
and the helpless Tashigi
can only weep at the sight of

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.447
her comrades being
felled by her superior.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.050
Then, at just the right moment,
a certain Straw Hat appears.

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.752
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:37.356
"The Treacherous Vice Admiral!
Demon Bamboo Vergo!"

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:40.292
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
