00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,663
Huh?

176
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,499
[PAULA]
You're a freak.

177
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,801
[MISTER TWO]
I am not a freak, Paula!

178
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,838
I am merely a talented
dancer practicing my craft.

179
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,739
I will take one
sparkling water, please.

180
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,740
[PAULA]
Don't have any.

181
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,676
Don't have any?
Gimme a break!

182
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,078
That's what all the high‐class
ballerinas drink!

183
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,180
[whines]

184
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,548
[MISTER TWO]
Oh, you're still here?

185
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,083
You guys can leave now.

186
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,184
[GROUP]
Right!

187
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,419
[MISTER TWO] And don't
forget to practice those new

188
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,554
dance moves like
we talked about.

189
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,757
[GROUP]
Right! Un, deux, un, deux.

190
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,758
How nice.

191
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,694
The fatty and the
old hag are here with us.

192
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,529
Why don't you just
shut your fat mouth,

193
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,431
you weirdo ballet‐dancing,
swan‐wearing

194
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,398
freak of nature!

195
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,601
Well! Nice to see you!

196
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,502
Did you hear?

197
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,203
It seems like even
Mister One's team

198
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,172
is being mobilized
for this assignment.

199
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,540
I've never actually
had the pleasure

200
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,209
of meeting him and his partner.

201
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,711
I'm really very excited!

202
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,714
[laughing]

203
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,385
[MISTER TWO sighs]

204
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:44,190
Moment by moment,
the night grows later.

205
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,559
We are nearing eight o'clock,
the appointed time.

206
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,604
[MISTER TWO]
Oh! I'm so bored!

207
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,442
Time to practice my spinning!

208
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,444
Yes, I'm bored,
so I'm going for a spin.

209
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,579
Around and around I go.

210
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,548
Quit it!
Just looking at you hurts!

211
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,315
Ooh!

212
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,816
What's your problem,
you old hag?

213
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,151
Do you wanna fight?

214
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,253
Do you really think
you can handle me?

215
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,489
Come, now, why don't
you two cut it out?

216
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,790
Stop fighting.

217
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,229
[GROUP yells]

218
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,336
Hey, what happened to you?

219
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,504
Why are you lying
there on the ground

220
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,140
instead of practicing like
you're supposed to be doing?

221
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,841
[SUBORDINATE 1]
We were! Until him!

222
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,177
[MISTER ONE]
Oh.

223
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,280
So these men are
acquaintances of yours?

224
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,782
[MISTER TWO growls]

225
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,284
[MISTER ONE] You see, I found
them acting suspicious

226
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,686
out in the desert.

227
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,488
Don't worry.
I doubt they'll die.

228
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,825
You seem unnecessarily
concerned about them.

229
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,761
Fostering friendships
will only make you weaker.

230
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,264
Those men are mine!
They don't belong to you!

231
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,799
You'd better stop, Mister Two!

232
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,937
[MISTER TWO]
Un. Deux. Krah!

233
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,674
[MISTER TWO]
Un. Deux. Krah!

234
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,878
[laughing]

235
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,715
Ball Change! Un. Deux!

236
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,858
What the hell?

237
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,660
He flew straight
through the wall!

238
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,962
He barely seemed to
notice it was happening!

239
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,400
[MISTER ONE]
Do you want to die that badly?

240
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,502
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Hold it.

241
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,371
That's enough playing
around, Mister One.

242
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,405
I'm not done.

243
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,574
Move, Miss Doublefinger.

244
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,843
I still haven't killed him yet.

245
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,711
[MR. 2] Stop it! Come on!
Just get off of me, fatty!

246
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,346
Oh! You're killing me...

247
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,214
[MISS DOUBLEFINGER]
Mr. 2.

248
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,416
It's time for you to
calm down as well.

249
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,484
It's eight o'clock.

250
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,888
All the agents that
should be here are here.

251
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,357
What's more, a letter
containing the orders

252
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,227
has arrived at the
Spiders Café. So...

253
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,864
We're instructed
to head to Rainbase,

254
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,333
the city of dreams.

255
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,435
In that city,
we'll meet someone.

256
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,605
A man we know, but whose
face we have never seen.

257
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,007
[GROUP gasps]

258
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,579
We're heading to meet the boss.

259
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,576
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
The officer agents should all be

260
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,945
on their way here
to Rainbase as we speak.

261
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,817
I sent Bunchi to get them.

262
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,619
I expect them to arrive
sometime later tonight.

263
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,292
[MISTER TWO] To think that
you've actually been

264
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,294
Miss Doublefinger
this entire time.

265
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,229
That's very interesting.

266
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,799
Who knows, perhaps
I would have told you.

267
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,635
But none of you ever
asked me about it.

268
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,971
[CROCODILE] The Billions
that we lost in Nanohana‐‐

269
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,774
have you been able
to find replacements?

270
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,008
[MISS ALL SUNDAY]
I've made the assignments

271
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,977
for the replacements.

272
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,646
As far as contacting
the new Billions,

273
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,583
I've dispatched the Lizard
Runners to see to that.

274
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,991
Good to hear.

275
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,693
Things are almost ready.

276
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,334
[VIVI]
Look up ahead! I see a light.

277
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,336
[LUFFY] Does that mean
we made it to Yuba?

278
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,205
I can't see with all this
sand blowing everywhere.

279
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,887
[VIVI] Something here
doesn't feel right.

280
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,791
There's something wrong
down there. I can tell.

281
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh, no!

282
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,876
The entire city is being
struck by a sandstorm!

283
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,900
Can't be.

284
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,206
[ZORO]
It doesn't look good.

285
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,707
This place doesn't
look much different

286
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,876
from that Eramalu
town from before.

287
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,213
Water!

288
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,048
Vivi, I thought this city
was supposed to be

289
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,382
some sort of oasis.

290
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,853
It looks like the
oasis has disappeared!

291
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,955
It's been swallowed up
by all the sand!

292
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,223
[shovel strikes]

293
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,396
[TOTO] I'm assuming
that you're travelers.

294
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,900
You must be exhausted from
all the time spent in that heat.

295
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,404
Sorry, but this town
is a bit dried up, too.

296
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,941
It doesn't have
much relief to offer.

297
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,777
But still, you're free
to rest here for a while.

298
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,816
[TOTO]
We may not have much water,

299
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,285
but there are plenty
of inns here in the town.

300
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,254
It's what we've prided
ourselves so much on,

301
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,822
after all.

302
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,957
[VIVI] Thank you, but we came
here because we thought

303
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,960
the rebel army was in this town.

304
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,263
[TOTO] What business do you
have with the rebel army?

305
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,764
Curse all of you!

306
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,332
If you're here to
join the rebel army,

307
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,668
you can just go back
where you came from!

308
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,141
[TOTO] If you're looking for
those fools, look elsewhere.

309
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,844
They're no longer in this town.

310
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,779
Wait, they're gone?!

311
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,181
They left?

312
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,017
[TOTO]
I'm sure you noticed

313
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,819
the town was just
hit by a sandstorm.

314
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,922
But that one certainly
wasn't the first.

315
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,190
After three years of no rain,

316
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,993
the land has become
increasingly dry.

317
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,297
Sandstorms became a
regular occurrence here.

318
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,365
Little by little,
the oasis that we knew

319
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,167
was swallowed up.

320
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,836
Until the town became
what you see now.

321
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,172
A dying wasteland.

322
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,841
With the flow of supplies
to the town ended,

323
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,878
the rebel army couldn't maintain
their drawn‐out struggle.

324
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,846
So they packed up.

325
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,014
They've moved on.

326
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,817
The rebel base is
now located in Katorea.

327
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,054
[VIVI]
Katorea?

328
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,221
Um, where's that?

329
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,390
Is Katorea close to here, Vivi?

330
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,160
It's near Nanohana.
Back the way we came from.

331
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,531
Katorea? That's where I
ended up when I got separated

332
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,366
from Sanji and met Eyelash!

333
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,071
That's right.
When you helped me get away...

334
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,239
Wait a second! Eyelash is
saying that he was carrying

335
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,308
rebel army goods to Katorea!

336
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,045
[GROUP arguing]

337
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,046
[CHOPPER]
Whatever.

338
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,349
[GROUP arguing]

339
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,584
[ZORO]
Well, great.

340
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,021
Coming all this way
was just a waste of time.

341
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,557
[TOTO]
Vivi. Wait, your name's‐‐

342
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,493
Hold on!
She's definitely not a princess!

343
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,894
Nice one, Luffy!

344
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,499
[TOTO] Princess Vivi?
Is that really you?

345
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,269
You're alive!
I can't believe it!

346
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,171
Thank goodness!

347
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,075
It's me, Vivi.
Don't you recognize me?

348
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,111
I look different.

349
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,546
I lost some weight, I suppose.

350
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,082
Toto! Is it really you?

351
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,586
That's right.

352
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:06,959
[VIVI]
It can't be.

353
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,099
[TOTO]
So long, my princess.

354
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,435
We won't see you for a while.

355
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,103
As soon as Yuba's
up and running,

356
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,605
stop by, Princess.

357
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,540
Yes, of course I will, Toto.

358
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,912
[TOTO] Yuba is going to do
a great deal for this dry,

359
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,447
desert country of ours.

360
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,451
[TOTO]
I know it.

361
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,396
Toto? That's this guy?

362
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,433
Whatever it's worth, Vivi dear,

363
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,635
I have faith in you
and the king.

364
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:53,972
He's a good man.

365
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,342
A true king who would
never betray his country.

366
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,510
I know it.

367
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:08,353
[TOTO crying]

368
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:25,304
[TOTO crying]

369
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,546
This rebellion is ridiculous!

370
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,883
A bunch of faithless fools.

371
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,457
[TOTO] True, our country
hasn't seen so much as

372
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,293
a drop of rain in three years.

373
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,562
But I still put my
trust in the king,

374
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,564
as I always have.

375
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,968
Most of the country still
has faith in him, actually.

376
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,972
[TOTO]
So many times.

377
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,541
I tried to stop them
so many times.

378
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,578
But they won't listen
to anything I say.

379
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,248
The rebellion isn't stopping.

380
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,216
Their strength,
supplies, and men

381
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,252
have reached the limit, however.

382
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,220
Their intention is
to settle everything

383
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,890
once and for all
with the next attack.

384
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,525
Their backs are
against the wall.

385
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,093
They're stuck in a corner.

386
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,165
Prepared for death.

387
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,203
[TOTO]
Please, Vivi!

388
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,572
You have to stop these
fools from tearing

389
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,207
our country apart!

390
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,925
[REBEL A]
Where's Leader?

391
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,126
[SOLDIER]
He's inside.

392
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:06,104
[TOTO crying]

393
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,980
Toto, old friend.

394
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,149
Please don't be worried.

395
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,383
Vivi, dear.

396
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,486
We'll succeed.

397
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,255
We're going to stop this.

398
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,166
[TOTO]
Thank you, Vivi!

399
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,252
[TOTO]
So long, my princess.

400
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,187
We won't see you for a while.

401
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,688
As soon as Yuba's
up and running,

402
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,757
stop by, Princess.

403
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,360
[VIVI]
Yes. Of course I will, Toto!

404
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,195
It's gonna be
the best town ever!

405
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,030
When it's up and running,
I'll personally give ya

406
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,198
the grand tour!

407
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,369
See ya, Vivi!

408
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,105
I hope ya grow up to become
a great princess someday!

409
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:13,705
'Kay!

410
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,707
[laughing]

411
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,054
[REBEL A]
Koza.

412
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,523
I've notified all of our
contacts in the other towns.

413
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,563
[KOZA]
This is it.

414
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:41,233
The time to strike
has finally arrived.

415
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,534
[REBEL A]
It has.

416
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,735
We aren't nearly as well armed

417
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,071
as I would like us
to be, though.

418
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,072
[KOZA]
I know.

419
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,640
But there's no other choice now.

420
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,344
We have a duty to
protect our country.

421
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,578
No one else can do it.

422
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,549
Only we can.

423
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,163
<i>♪Remember when we</i>
<i>were kids we longed for</i>

424
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:16,435
<i>adventures greater than</i>
<i>anything we had ever dreamed!</i>

425
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,603
<i>Let's set sail,</i>
<i>it's not too late!</i>

426
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,606
<i>As I scoop up the sand,</i>

427
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,710
<i>watch it fall between my hands,</i>

428
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,180
<i>The sand, it flows like time...</i>

429
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,283
<i>I can hear it calling!</i>

430
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,553
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>the time is now!</i>

431
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,290
<i>I know that this is</i>

432
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,262
<i>Don't look back,</i>

433
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:50,469
<i>At breakneck speed, I know</i>
<i>we'll arrive there soon!</i>

434
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,472
<i>If we do not give up,</i>

435
00:22:53,472 --> 00:23:01,146
<i>Someday we'll wash up on that</i>

436
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,316

<i>all that far away...♪</i>

437
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,664
[LUFFY] I wanna kill
Crocodile right now!

438
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,833
[SANJI] He has a way of going
straight to the point sometimes,

439
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,667
doesn't he?

440
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,769
[USOPP]
So he does have a good quality.

441
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,604
[LUFFY] Vivi, you're saying
that you don't want

442
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,305
anyone to die in this fight?

443
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,607
You'll never win that way!

444
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,841
[NAMI]
Calm down, Luffy.

445
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,844
[LUFFY] Sometimes you have to
put lives on the line to win!

446
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,613
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

447
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,148
"Luffy vs. Vivi!

448
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,583
The Tearful Vow to Put
Friends on the Line!"

449
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,253
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
