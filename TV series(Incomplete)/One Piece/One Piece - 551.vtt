00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.038
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.079
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.415
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.587
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.522
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:26.693
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.591
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.561
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:46.733
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.302
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.605
chart these waters and learn
all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.440
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.843
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.612
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:04.184
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:05.852
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.522
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:13.927
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.498
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.234
Luffy and his crew arrive
on the Fishman Island,

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:25.405
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.740
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:32.612
and assisted by Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.315
[NARRATOR] It's not long
before the Straw Hats

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.150
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:41.754
which results in Hordy detaining
Zoro, Usopp, and Brook.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.623
Get outta my way, Jimbei.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.391
I won't let you
keep me here anymore.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.828
Let me handle it. You stay put.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.831
Shut up!

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:55.101
Sanji said all that cool stuff
and you still wanna fight?

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:59.239
If that is what it takes to
make you listen to me, yes!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.642
[LUFFY]
What did you say?!

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:08.748
[HORDY groaning]

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:14.787
[HORDY screaming]

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.266
[HORDY]
Huh?

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:32.338
[chuckles] Some of Neptune's
soldiers are still alive.

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:35.341
[ALL gasp]

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.943
Water Shot.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.614
[AMMO KNIGHTS screaming]

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:51.758
[laughing]

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:02.235
[LUFFY] "The Battle Is On!
At Conchcorde Plaza!"

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.813
[SEA BEAR 550A roars]

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:18.384
[chuckles] Captain Hordy
sure is something else!

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:21.454
One second, he's writhing in
agony-hhi from an overdose,

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:24.624
then he levels a whole town
with a flick of his wrist!

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.307
[FISHMEN gasping]

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:46.479
[FISHMAN A gasps]
No. Neptune's army is done for.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.381
Every last one.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.551
[FISHMAN D]
They didn't stand a chance.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.754
[FISHMAN E] Hordy's too strong.
We're all done for.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.924
[FISHMAN F]
Minister of the Right!

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.093
Minister of the Left!

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.862
King Neptune!

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.998
[FISHMAN G]
Do something!

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.767
[NEPTUNE groans]

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.471
We've wasted enough
time. Onto the plaza.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:14.374
[roars]

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.809
[FISHMAN F]
No! They're taking him away!

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:18.077
[FISHMAN G gasps]

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:19.479
[roars]

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:20.880
[gasps]

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.891
We couldn't do anything!

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:37.530
[ALL groaning]

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.099
We were so close.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.134
You're going to be okay.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.969
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
After so long...

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.971
Please stay with us.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:49.442
...we were finally
supposed to see results.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:53.012
This was going to be our
year at the World Summit!

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:55.882
Queen Otohime!

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:59.218
But then they had to
come and ruin everything!

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.154
Someone help us!

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.522
Save the king!

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:05.558
If we don't stop them soon,
he will be executed!

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.995
Surely, someone can fight!

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:23.943
Look, Ma!

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.111
[FISHWOMAN B gasps]

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:40.760
[FISHMAN B] This is the end of
our whole country, isn't it?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:08:03.149
[DECKEN crying]

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.718
[DECKEN LACKEY A]
C'mon, Captain. Quit blubberin'!

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.787
[DECKEN LACKEY B] Yeah,
things'll start lookin' up soon.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.555
Just get back in the game!

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.257
Like I would ever take advice

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.359
from a couple of
losers like you!

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:16.529
You guys have no idea what it's
like having your heart broken!

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.464
These feelings are real!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.067
I've wanted her
since I first saw her!

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.037
Sure, she was just a kid,
but I knew if I married her,

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.174
I could fulfill my
ancestors' dream!

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.977
But what happened instead?

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.946
[giggles]

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:43.856
You're just not my type!

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.760
[DECKEN]
No!

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.662
"Not my type," she said.

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.497
When the words came to my ears,

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.833
I felt my love grow.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:57.937
A flawless haiku by Vander
Decken the Ninth, I suspect.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.140
My soul. It's aching!

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.577
[sobbing]

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.912
After she rejected me,

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:09.215
I felt like it was time for
a change, so I cut my hair!

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:10.483
[sobs]

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.751
[DECKEN LACKEYS]
Why just the top?

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:14.587
I thought I'd kill her instead,
but I can't even get that right!

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.790
I know she's alive 'cause I can
still throw things at her!

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.759
This is that Straw Hat's fault!

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:25.197
[sobbing]

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.299
[DECKEN]
Huh?

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:29.535
[DECKEN]
Wait. That's it!

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:34.640
[DECKEN chuckling]

00:09:34.674 --> 00:09:35.741
[DECKEN LACKEY A]
What's so funny?

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:39.278
My idea! If I can't
end her existence,

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.915
then I'll just have to
end everyone else's!

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:47.119
[DECKEN chuckles]
It's gonna be great! You'll see!

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:54.627
[DECKEN cackling]

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:13.846
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.329
Release our king
right now, Hordy!

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.365
Last warning!

00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.713
I mean it! We will fire! [gasps]

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:50.216
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE A chuckles]

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:59.091
[NEPTUNE]
Run, soldiers!

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.826
Don't throw your lives away!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.695
It's not that easy-hhi!

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:03.829
Sea Bear!

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.564

[AMMO KNIGHTS panting]

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:14.674
Go!

[AMMO KNIGHTS scream]

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:25.484

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:28.621
Take this, you bastard! [groans]

[AMMO KNIGHTS gasping]

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:57.383
[laughs] About time
you got here!

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:59.452
I was getting sick of waiting!

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.520
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE B]
We finally made it, Hyouzou.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:04.223
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE E]
Be careful! He will cut you!

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:07.493
[DOSUN]
I have arrived! At last!

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:12.431
[ZEO chuckles] And now there is
nowhere left for you to run.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.636
[AMMO KNIGHTS gasp]

00:12:32.952 --> 00:12:34.086
[FISHMAN H]
We can't get in!

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.956
They locked the entrance
to the plaza behind them!

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:38.958
[FISHMAN I]
King Neptune!

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:40.226
[FISHMAN J]
Let's scale the wall!

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.294
Maybe we can see inside!

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.898
It's settled.

00:13:52.932 --> 00:13:55.701
That boy sure gave me a
lot of trouble, though.

00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:59.138
[JIMBEI]
We've wasted far too much time.

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:01.140
We need to be on our
way now, Princess.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.942
[SHIRAHOSHI gasps]
Okay!

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.612
[JIMBEI] We're leaving
Hachi in your care, Camie!

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.347
[CAMIE]
Uh, right!

00:14:09.548 --> 00:14:11.417
Let us make haste, Megalo!

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.653
[MEGALO]
Shaa!

00:14:54.326 --> 00:14:59.765
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES laughing]

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:01.700
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE F] I thought
you soldiers were supposed to

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.769
protect this country!

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.877

[ZEO]
Look alive, boys.

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:26.959
That soldier's up to something.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:30.329
[DARUMA laughs]
You think so?

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.197
Looks like he's
packin' dynamite!

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:35.367
He's gonna blow everyone up with
some kind of suicide attack!

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:36.502
[IKAROS laughs]

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:40.072
But if he does that, I'm gonna
turn into roasted squid!

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.343
[AMMO KNIGHT H] The three
princes should get here soon,

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:47.713
but I can take out at least
one of you before they do!

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.685
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE G]
Oh, no! Look out!

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.056
Water Shot.

[FISHMAN K]
What the crap?

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:15.908
How far can it go?

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:38.197
[MERO gasps]
You hear that?

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.131
Huh?

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.700
[MERO] That whistling
sound. What is it?

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:45.604
[FISHWOMEN gasp]

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.601
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE D]
Hey, am I crazy?

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:19.071
I was under the impression the
Water Shot wasn't that strong.

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:29.081
I know it took a lot of Energy
Steroid to get that tough,

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:31.116
but still, that was incredible!

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.652
[ZEO] We never anticipated it
changing your hair color

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:36.388
or increasing your muscle
mass so greatly, though.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.924
How are you feeling, Captain?

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:40.626
Couldn't be better.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:47.833
[HORDY]
Hm?

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.001
[NEPTUNE]
Huh?

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:56.909
[FISHMEN cheering]

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.548
What happened here?

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.615
[RYUBOSHI growls]

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:06.351
Why didn't the soldiers
wait for us to help them?

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.753
[FUKABOSHI gasps]

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.935
[NEPTUNE]
Fukaboshi! Ryuboshi! Mamboshi!

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.436
Don't underestimate them.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.271
Both their ranks and
their sea monsters

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.073
have been empowered by a drug!

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.274
[RYUBOSHI]
Now it makes sense.

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.476
On an even playing field,

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.846
Neptune's army would
never lose a sortie-do!

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.415
It's time to mambo! Ready?

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.225
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.771
[HORDY chuckles]

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.807
Why don't you understand?

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.542
You're all so pathetic!

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:07.212
You New Fishman Pirates
are just a bunch of cowards!

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:09.581
The other islanders let go
of their hurt feelings

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:12.084
brought on by the
humans' discrimination.

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:13.619
And despite the fact that humans

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.754
murdered their hero
and their queen,

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:17.823
they're willing to forgive them.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:19.491
Even after all of
their suffering,

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.593
they still signed their names,

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.730
because they want to
change the future!

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.098
Your Highness!

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.966
Prince Fukaboshi!

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.704
What you do undermines
their efforts!

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:36.041
Can't you recognize
their bravery?

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.644
You're kidding me, right?

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.346
Don't mistake their
kindness for courage.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.616
It gives the humans another
excuse to take advantage of us!

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.086
[SEA ANIMALS roar]

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.422
[FUKABOSHI yells]

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.991
[FUKABOSHI]
Spear of the Ages!

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.661
[MANBOSHI]
Seven Great Treasures!

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.330
[RYUBOSHI]
Dragon Tower Gate!

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:05.671
[FISHMEN] The princes
beat the sea monsters!

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.574
There's hope after all!

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:10.576
[FUKABOSHI] You seek
revenge not for justice,

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:13.111
but because of your
own personal hatred!

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.214
I won't let you
take the king's life,

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:18.116
nor the island his
citizens call home.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.253
You will never have
the Ryugu Kingdom!

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.892
[FISHMEN cheering]

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:28.227
[FISHMAN L]
We're saved!

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.263
We should've known we could
count on the princes!

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.203
So you beat some sea monsters.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.373
Do you think that means
you've claimed victory?

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.408
We will never be defeated,

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:47.980
because we've been granted
a power that is absolute.

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:50.949
And with that power,
we will rule this country

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:54.253
the way it was
always meant to be!

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.722
The future of this
country is peace!

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.758
Peace with the humans and peace
without monsters like you!

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.493
If we don't triumph here,

00:21:01.526 --> 00:21:03.762
we'll have failed and it
will be hundreds of years

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:06.898
before we have another shot at
friendship with the human world!

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:10.235
[HORDY]
Oh, is that a fact? Heh.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.838
Well, then the winners
of this fight

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.474
will rule this country.

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:50.042
They look stronger!

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:55.781
[ALL grunt]

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:58.150
[FUKABOSHI gasps]
What? But how?

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:01.386
[ZEO]
Too slow.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.423
[FUKABOSHI yells]

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:08.293
[RYUBOSHI screams]

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:14.833
[MANBOSHI yells]

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:17.602
[DOSUN grunts]

00:22:19.604 --> 00:22:20.539
[gasps]

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.478
[yells]

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:27.846
[FISHMEN gasp]

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:36.421
Time is running short, Megalo!

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.090
[MEGALO]
Shaa!

00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:39.691
Be safe, Father.

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:41.193
We'll be there soon.

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.761
He's going to be fine!

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.863
I promise you, Princess!

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:53.338
[PRINCES groaning]

00:22:56.074 --> 00:23:00.445
This drug of yours is
fearsome indeed, Hordy.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.553
[laughing]

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:15.961
[NARRATOR] Shirahoshi and Jimbei
hurry to Conchcorde Plaza

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.629
to free King Neptune,

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:20.265
but their rescue plan
is cut short by a trap.

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:22.401
With the royal family
now captured,

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.269
Hordy reveals a schocking truth

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.271
about the history
of his revolution.

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:28.640
While the island is
seized with despair,

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:31.276
Vander Decken does
something rash.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:33.011
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.780
"A Surprising Confession!

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:38.016
The Truth Behind the
Assassination of Otohime!"

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:40.619
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
