Travel across the oceans of the world

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27

Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,074
[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:40,577
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,248
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:50,253
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,157
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,527
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

43
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,963
Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,433
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

45
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,369
of dreams greater than
they'd ever dared to imagine!

46
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,639
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

47
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,678
Negative Hollow!

48
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,130

[USOPP] My name...
is Captain Usopp.

50
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:41,304
[PERONA] I don't get it!

51
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:43,640
Why don't my attacks
do anything to you?

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,676
I know I didn't miss
that time! What is this?

53
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,078
What kind of power have you got?

54
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,314
Power has nothing to do with it.

55
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:58,221
I just naturally have
a negative personality!

56
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:02,725
What?

57
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,764
[LUFFY] "The General Zombies
are Down in a Flash!

59
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,572
The Negative Ghost's
power had no effect!

60
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,208
What kind of a
man is he, anyway?

61
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,311
[PERONA thinking] The Negative
Hollows don't work against him?

62
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,113
That doesn't make any sense!

63
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:59,082
This has to be
some kind of trick!

64
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,223
[USOPP thinking] Dammit!
Didn't they hear me?

65
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,759
I told them to take
out all these zombies!

66
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:13,629
I specifically asked for
help and they left anyway!

67
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:16,299
Even if I could somehow
manage to beat this girl,

68
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,800
with all these zombies around,

69
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:21,404
there's no way I'd make
it out of here alive!

70
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,607
Crap! Is this the end?

71
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,777
This is impossible!

72
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,080
No matter how I look
at it, it's impossible!

[NEGATIVE GHOSTS]
Horo horo horo horo!

74
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,589
That last one
must have been a dud.

00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,623
With this final attack,

00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:44,660

bit of your will to live.

It's freaking me out!

93
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:37,914
Now listen up.

There's no one, not
anyone in this entire world.

Who can defeat me in negativity!

96
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:53,362
Ahh! What a terrible
source of self-esteem!

97
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,574
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 357C]
But for someone so pumped up,

98
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,376
he seems to have
gotten smaller somehow.

[RANDOM ZOMBIE 357D]
I think that's

100
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,246
because he's backing away.

00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,781
Get back here!

Hey, jerk!

My animal zombies are too cute

Stay away from me,

It's salt! Watch out!

[USOPP] Come on!
That's not fair at all!

108
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,653
Why'd I have
to call out, "Salt Star"?

109
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,759
[ZORO] I never
expected Usopp's pessimism

110
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,594
to come in handy during a fight.

111
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,463
Yeah, that was a close one!

112
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:01,397
If he hadn't have been there,

113
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,566
that would've been
the end for all of us!

114

Good luck! Go kick some ass!

[ZORO] Hey, uh...

00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,326
Aren't we pretty high up
for him to jump like that?

124
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,327
[FRANKY] Maybe.

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,828
But don't forget: when
the adrenaline kicks in,

126
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,765
you won't feel the
pain until later.

127

Either way, let's get
to the top of that mansion!

You rise back up like
you're a phoenix or,

around here, a bit
more like a zombie.

No matter.

137
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,503
You won't be able
to stand much longer.

00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:20,344
[RYUMA] I'll make sure you
stay down for good this time.

No more of these pointless
efforts to get your shadow back.

Now tell me.

00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:27,451
What part of that
wretched excuse for a body

142
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:30,955
would you like me to sever
with my Arrow Notch Slash?

[BROOK] Shut up.

You don't know the first
thing about that technique!

145
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,799
You have no right
to even speak its name!

146
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:53,544
[BROOK] I used to serve in
my kingdom's Raider Squad.

147
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:54,478
The quick draw attack at which

148
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,647
I was most skilled
was originally

149
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:59,383
called the
"Requiem Lebanderole."

150
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,385
However, my
comdares-in-arms renamed it

151
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:04,555
in regard to my own
sword-fighting technique.

152
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:09,794
They called it: "Three Verse
Humming: Arrow Notch Slash."

153
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:13,564
Even if you share my
personality and my techniques.

154
00:11:13,564 --> 00:11:14,665
You've forgotten my memories

155
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:16,901
and all the feelings
attached to them.

156
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,070
Which means you will
not use that name!

Well, if those

don't you do something about it?

I just want to apologize to you.

[BROOK thinking] An apology
from the depths of my misery.

00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:58,062
[BROOK] It's so lonely.
My life. So lonely.

176
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:09,306
I'm waiting.

177
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,909
Tell me where you'd
like me to start cutting.

178
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:13,844
Nyohohohoho!

179
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,284
[RYUMA] Well, while you're
making up your mind,

180
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:25,356
I think I'll start
with this afro.

181
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:30,694
Nyohohohoho!

182
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,118
[RYUMA] Well, while you're
making up your mind,

183
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:56,887
I think I'll start
with this afro.

184
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:02,893
Nyohohohoho!

185
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,298
Nyohohohohohaha!

186
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,808
What's going on?
The entire mansion is shaking!

187
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,712
[FRANKY] Whoa! What's up
with all this rumbling?

188
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,915
[ZORO] Don't know, don't care.
Probably just an earthquake.

189
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,019
[FRANKY] Is that the laboratory?

190
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:33,824
Look! There's
the skeleton guy!

191
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,894
Can you hear me?

192
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,429
Looks like you took
quite a beating.

193
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,832
But you're still alive,
aren't you? Say something!

194
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,202
Am I dreaming?
Why are you here?

195
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,410
[RYUMA] Nyohoho...
This won't do at all!

196
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:56,347
How dare you try to
interfere with our battle!

197
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:00,017
[ZORO] Not so fast.

198
00:16:00,851 --> 00:16:03,420
[ZORO] Tell me... Are
you the legendary samurai

199
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:06,190
that slayed a dragon
in ancient times?

200
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:16,684
Heh! I've been
hoping to meet you.

201
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:23,340
[rumbling]

202
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,109
What the heck's
going on here?

203
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:27,511
This whole place is
shaking like crazy!

204
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:29,179
If I were to guess,

205
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:30,614
I'd say the ship's
probably been caught

206
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:33,017
in some strange ocean current.

207
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,585
At any rate,
whatever the hell it is,

208
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:39,923
I'm blaming everything on you.
Kushishishi!

209
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,592
Oh. Speaking of which.

210
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,261
You're probably not
here to chat, are you?

211
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,130
Just tell me what
you want already.

212
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:47,131
Oh, yeah.

213
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,166
I'm here because of that
crap you pulled earlier

214
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,602
when you took
my shadow with that lamp.

215
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,704
[LUFFY] I'm taking it back,

216
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:56,607
along with Zoro's,
Sanji's, and Brook's!

217
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,610
Oh and the old zombie
guy's, too! All of 'em!

218
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:03,280
My, you're a
greedy one, aren't you?

219
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,283
And how do you plan
on achieving all of that?

220
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,721
Obviously by kicking your ass.

221
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:15,626
Oh?
Kushishishishi!

222
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:22,366
Kushishishishi!
Kushishishishi!

223
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:26,637
[rumbling]

224
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:32,142
[loud crashing]

225
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,361
What the hell is going on?

226
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:52,563
I'm trying to give
the closing kiss!

227
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:55,332
It's kind of a big moment here!

228
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,000
[ZOMBIE GENERAL CAPED KNIGHT]
Master Absalom!

229
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,069
[ABSALOM] What is it?
What's with all this shaking?

230
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:00,437
[ZOMBIE GENERAL CAPED KNIGHT]
Thriller Bark has been caught up

231
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:01,438
in some strange current.

232
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,273
We're being thrown
around all over the place!

233
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,676
The whole island is shaking!

234
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,948
[ABSALOM] How did that happen?

235
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:12,082
[ZOMBIE GENERAL CAPED KNIGHT]
Well, probably because the

236
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:15,419
Special Zombie is moving
the rudder without permission.

237
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,087
[ABSALOM] What did you say?

238
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:24,294
[OARS] It's moving! It's moving!

239
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:32,603
Faster! Faster! Faster, faster,
faster, faster, faster!

240
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,609
Zombie Generals,
listen up! Move out!

241
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:41,645
Get out there, find Oars,
and stop him no matter what!

242
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:42,813
[ZOMBIE GENERALS]
Yes, sir!

243
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,716
[OARS] Faster, faster, faster!

244
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,657
[ZOMBIE GENERAL LONGBEARD]
Oars!

245
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,898
[ZOMBIE GENERAL LONGBEARD]
That's enough out of you,

246
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:05,169
Special Zombie Oars. Bring him
down! Start with the feet!

247
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,570
[ZOMBIE GENERALS]
Yeah!

248
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,573
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 357A]
What the?

249
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:15,779
[ZOMBIE GENERAL LONGBEARD]
He disappeared! Where'd he go?

250
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,149
[ZOMBIE GENERAL LONGBEARD] How
could something that big just...

251
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,185
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 348B ]
There's nowhere for him to hide!

252
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,494
[ZOMBIE GENERAL 348B]
There he is! Above us!

253
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:38,302
Now Gum-Gum--though it's
not really rubber--Gatling!

254
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,253
I'm tired of everybody getting

255
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,489
in the way of my fun time!

256
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,695
Annihilated?

257
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:42,266
You mean the entire group
that just left here?

258
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,768
[ZOMBIE 356A] Uh, yes sir. They
were squished flat. All of them.

259
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:46,003
[ABSALOM] But that's impossible!

260
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,772
Those guys are the strongest
Zombie Division on the island!

261
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,906
The Zombie Generals!

262
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,743
[ZOMBIE 356A] Yes. And he
took them out. Instantly.

263
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:54,611
That can't be.

264
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:57,347
Isn't Oars supposed
to be on our side?

265
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:59,616
Then why is he
revolting against us?

266
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,518
Zombies are
made to be obedient!

267
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:02,552
It's in their nature!

268
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,689
We can't let him keep up
all this rampaging around!

269
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,357
If we don't find
a way to stop him,

270
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,792
he'll sink the whole island!

271
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,236
Nami! I'm here to rescue you!

272
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:24,207
My love!

273
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,877
Is he one of the
Straw Hat Pirates?

274
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,576
Amazing!

275
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:02,579
He was able to fend
off Ryuma's attack!

276
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:04,848
I didn't know he was so strong!

277
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:06,817
[FRANKY] He's the Three-Sword
Style pirate swordsman

278
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,285
of the Straw Hats.

279
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,354
You better believe he's strong!

280
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,022
Looks like he's
itching for a fight.

281
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:13,590
If your pride will allow it,

282
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,424
I think he was planning

283
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,493
on getting your
shadow back for you.

284
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:17,794
What do you say?

285
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:20,931
[BROOK] My shadow?
Really? Yes! I beg of you!

286
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:23,934
Whatever you need to do!
Please get my shadow back!

287
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,768
I'd be ever so...

288
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,703
Enough, already!
Shut the hell up!

289
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,439
Aaaaaaa!

290
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,775
Hey! Skeleton guy!

291
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:34,311
[ZORO] That's a really
interesting looking katana

292
00:22:34,344 --> 00:22:35,779
you've got there.

293
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:39,616
Nyohoho. You have good eyes.

294
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,486
Yes, this is indeed one
of the 21 legendary swords

295
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,321
of the highest grade.

296
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:47,557
A famed black blade with a
reverse-waved temper line.

297
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:51,395
It's known as the
Clear Autumn Wind, Shusui.

298
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:53,997
Consider yourself fortunate
to cast your eyes on it.

299
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,300
[ZORO] So it is one
of the legendary swords.

300
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,569
You're right, I am lucky.

301
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:01,805
Though I did expect you
to have a good blade,

302
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,841
being that you're
a samurai and all.

303
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,643
That settles it.

304
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm gonna beat you and
take that sword as my own.

305
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,650
[BROOK] Ah!! Oh, you're so cool!

306
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:20,991
[SANJI] Nami, my love!

307
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:24,394
I won't ever leave your side,
no matter what happens!

308
00:23:24,428 --> 00:23:25,395
[ABSALOM] Dammit!

309
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,531
I'm in the middle of an
important ceremony here!

310
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,499
Hey! Are you even
listening to me?

311
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,902
[SANJI] Why should I listen
to you? You're done for.

312
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:34,838
You've gone way beyond the
limitations of forgiveness.

313
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:36,339
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

314
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,843
"Blazing Knight Sanji!
Kick Down the Fake Wedding!"

315
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:42,045
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
