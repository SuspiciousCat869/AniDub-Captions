WEBVTT

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:32.051
[cackles] My darkness
will swallow the world,

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.422
just you wait and see!

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:36.258
You think I’ll lose to you?

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.429
I’m gonna be King
of the Pirates!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.772
Roger’s treasure belongs to me!

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:38.082
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.989
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:46.266
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.336
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:48.436 --> 00:02:52.011
to ever chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:53.948
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.319
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.957
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.699
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D.
Luffy, a boy whose body

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.036
became rubber after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:08.911
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:13.219
I’m gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.259
[NARRATOR]
In order to defeat

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.363
one of the Four Emperors
of the New World,

00:03:18.463 --> 00:03:20.569
the Straw Hats form
an alliance with Law.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.670
Their current objective

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.941
is to destroy a man-made
Devil Fruit Factory

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.578
in the kingdom of Dressrosa.

00:03:25.678 --> 00:03:27.816
Upon arrival, Luffy
entered a fighting tournament

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.487
that promises the Flame-Flame
Fruit to the champion.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.493
[LUFFY]
Traffy!

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:36.734
[NARRATOR] Later, after Luffy
reunites with Zoro and Kin'emon,

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:40.140
Doflamingo bursts onto
the scene and shoots Law.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.913
[LUFFY] You're gonna pay
for doing that to Traffy!

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:46.118
Don't you know?
Law used to work for me.

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:49.024
I'm just cleaning
up my own mess.

00:03:55.203 --> 00:04:00.247
[LUFFY] "Luffy Astonished! The
Man Who Inherits Ace's Will!"

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.919
[thud, crash]

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:08.296
[groans]

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:16.479
[giggles]

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:21.690
I made an oopsie! So sorry!

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.694
I wanted you to die
without suffering,

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:27.568
but it looks like I missed
a vital spot. [giggles]

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.873
No, something isn't right.

00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:31.175
Huh?

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:36.553
I pledged by undying
loyalty to Joker, didn't I?

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.934
And you say he
sent you to kill me?

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.972
I don't buy it!

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:47.240
I've had enough!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.080
Spring Death Knock!

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.286
Aw, poor thing!
It's hard for you, huh?

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:57.227
But we just don't need you!

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.039
[BELLAMY groans]

00:05:07.716 --> 00:05:10.254
You would only be
a burden to the Family.

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:13.226
[DELLINGER laughs]

00:05:19.973 --> 00:05:21.009
[BELLAMY groans]

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:22.344
[gasps]

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:26.687
[BELLAMY] Damn it! I can't
even fight! All I can do is run!

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:30.260
But that brat's
gotta be lying to me!

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.669
[BELLAMY grunting]

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.074
[BELLAMY] If I can find
Joker, he'll settle this!

00:05:37.174 --> 00:05:39.646
I wanna hear it face-to face!

00:05:39.746 --> 00:05:41.550
[BELLAMY groans]

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:48.029
[BELLAMY groans]

00:05:58.884 --> 00:06:02.759
You can't win and you can't run,
so just give up, 'kay?

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:06.031
[BELLAMY yells]

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.212
You didn't even join

00:06:13.312 --> 00:06:15.818
and you're being a burden
to the Young Master already!

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.189
[BELLAMY groans]

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.169
[BELLAMY panting]

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:34.823
Say night-night, Bellamy!

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:36.358
[gasps]

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:44.041
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]
Sorry, kid, that's my barrier.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:48.818
The heck are you doing here?

00:06:48.918 --> 00:06:51.122
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:52.625
Is that Bartolomeo?

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:54.696
Our fight is none
of your business!

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:57.034
Sorry, were you fighting?

00:06:57.134 --> 00:06:59.740
I just put up a barrier
'cause I felt like it, honestly.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.010
I was given an order
by the Young Master!

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.484
If you get in my way,
I'll kill you, too!

00:07:05.585 --> 00:07:08.089
[laughs] You can try!

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.659
But good luck
breaking my barrier

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.297
with those little baby kicks!

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:15.269
--[DELLINGER growls]
--[TRANSPONDER SNAIL ringing]

00:07:16.906 --> 00:07:17.509
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL clicks]

00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:18.511
What d'you want?!

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:19.847
I'm in the middle
of something here!

00:07:19.947 --> 00:07:21.850
[DIAMANTE]
Curb the attitude, Dellinger.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.985
[DELLINGER grunts]

00:07:23.085 --> 00:07:24.556
I was gonna ask if you
were done with Bellamy,

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:26.492
but it seems you're still at it.

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:27.629
You're too slow.

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.165
It's not my fault!

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:30.634
I got interrupted!

00:07:30.734 --> 00:07:32.070
[BARTOLOMEO cackles]

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.609
[DIAMANTE] It's fine.
Just finish him later.

00:07:34.709 --> 00:07:35.912
Uh?

00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:38.082
[DIAMANTE]
Doffy has a new order for you.

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:39.284
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:42.057
Go guard the Toy House
with Lao-G and his group.

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:43.193
On the double!

00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:45.764
C'mon, Diamante,
I'm almost done here!

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:47.835
Just give me a sec and
he'll be good and dead!

00:07:47.936 --> 00:07:51.141
[DIAMANTE] No way! You'll follow
orders and you'll like it!

00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.444
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL clicks]

00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:55.851
[coughing]

00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:59.659
[BELLAMY]
A new order?

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:05.336
Then it's true.
He really does want me dead.

00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:07.908
Screw this crap.

00:08:10.614 --> 00:08:12.718
And screw you, too!

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.861
[DELLINGER]
Get out of my way!

00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:18.530
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles]

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:21.970
Let me kill him!

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.840
I am gonna stomp him dead!

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.278
Now move!

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:29.986
You kiddin'?
I'm not budging an inch!

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.424
You don't want your
boss gettin' mad, do ya?

00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:33.927
So just go already!

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:37.935
[DELLINGER gasps, growls] You
and your barrier can go to hell!

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.407
This isn't over by a long shot!

00:08:40.508 --> 00:08:44.849
Mark my words, you're not
leaving Dressrosa alive!

00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:49.559
[BARTOLOMEO chuckles] Yeah,
yeah, that's what they all say.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:53.601
[BELLAMY] That was Diamante
on the Transponder Snail.

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:56.439
So, everything
Dellinger said was true.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.378
That means Doflamingo
was the one who was lying.

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:02.785
All this time...
he was toying with me?

00:09:02.886 --> 00:09:05.256
So I just gotta
win the tournament?

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:08.129
Then you'll give me
a spot in the Family?

00:09:09.197 --> 00:09:11.302
Of course.

00:09:11.402 --> 00:09:13.205
[gasps]

00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:15.276
I'll be cheering for you.

00:09:15.376 --> 00:09:17.314
Good luck out there.

00:09:17.414 --> 00:09:19.385
[BELLAMY gasps]
Thank you!

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:23.259
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:26.331
[BELLAMY grunts]

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:34.883
Lemme take you to
the medical room, buddy.

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:35.952
Dammit!

00:09:36.052 --> 00:09:38.489
I don't need you
butting in! Just go away!

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.032
Leave me alone. I've lost
my only reason to live.

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:47.207
Why the hell do you wanna
save me in the first place, huh?

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:49.679
We were enemies!

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.948
I woulda killed you along

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:53.653
with everyone else
in that battle royale.

00:09:53.753 --> 00:09:55.724
Now you're protecting me?

00:09:55.824 --> 00:09:56.392
Yep!

00:09:56.492 --> 00:09:58.162
[cries]

00:09:58.263 --> 00:10:01.035
When men fight in the same ring,
they become like brothers!

00:10:01.135 --> 00:10:03.807
We're comrades in battle now!

00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:10.119
And, damn it, I'd never
turn my back on a comrade!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.440
[TOY SOLDIER] Now you know the
dark history of this nation.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:22.043
And next,

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:25.483
I shall tell you how
I plan to liberate its people.

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:27.822
What do I call
this plan, you ask?

00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:32.397
Operation Dressrosa SOP!

00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:34.936
[DWARVES gasp]

00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:38.644
SOP, huh? So what
does that stand for?

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:40.047
[TOY SOLDIER]
Beneath this kingdom,

00:10:40.147 --> 00:10:42.819
there is a massive,
underground network.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.689
Unbeknownst to the people above,

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:47.494
there lies a trade port
for black market dealings,

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.799
as well as a mysterious factory.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.401
There, the captured Tontatta,

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:54.174
along with the humans who
have been transformed into toys,

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:56.078
are forced to work
around the clock.

00:10:56.178 --> 00:10:59.519
[FRANKY] Okay, cool, but
what does SOP mean, again?

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.656
[TOY SOLDIER] We'll sneak in
through an underground passage

00:11:01.756 --> 00:11:03.994
that we've been digging
for an entire year.

00:11:04.094 --> 00:11:06.566
Then, we'll rescue everyone!

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:10.072
I see! Now get to the part where
you tell us what SOP means,

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:12.144
'cause I know
it's gotta be super.

00:11:12.244 --> 00:11:13.613
[ROBIN]
Franky, give it up.

00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:18.022
We'll wreck the facilities and
defeat the Doflamingo Family.

00:11:18.122 --> 00:11:21.395
Then King Riku will
return to the throne!

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.633
That is goal of our operation.

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.671
I doubt it'll be
quite that easy!

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:28.677
Of course, there
may be complications.

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:30.614
After all,
none of us can predict

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:32.317
what might happen in Dressrosa,

00:11:32.417 --> 00:11:34.789
especially in its current state.

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:36.593
[FRANKY, USOPP gulp]

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:41.503
That said, there is one thing
we must do if we want to win.

00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:42.705
[FRANKY]
Hm?

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:44.776
The one who turned us into toys

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:48.216
is a member of
Doflamingo's inner circle.

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:50.353
We'll target them
and shut down the power

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:52.157
of their Hobby-Hobby Fruit.

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:53.226
[FRANKY, ROBIN, USOPP gasp]

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:55.263
Hobby-Hobby what?

00:11:55.363 --> 00:11:57.300
We simply have
to knock them out.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.507
[gasps] And doing so will
break the spell on the toys?

00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:01.776
That's correct!

00:12:01.876 --> 00:12:05.082
All of the toys will
return to their human forms!

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:08.523
In the secret factory
and the streets alike!

00:12:08.623 --> 00:12:10.528
Then, the lost memories of them

00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:13.767
will come flooding back
to their loved ones.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.704
While that's a
victory in itself,

00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:17.975
it's hard to say
what will follow.

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:20.013
[USOPP grunts]

00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:22.585
[FRANKY gasps]

00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:26.358
How many of the former toys
will rise up in arms with us?

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.197
What will the citizens think
when their memories are restored

00:12:29.297 --> 00:12:31.703
and what action will they take?

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:33.807
How will Doflamingo respond?

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:36.078
How will the Navy respond?

00:12:36.178 --> 00:12:37.849
The only thing that
we know for certain

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:41.055
is that the kingdom
will be thrown into chaos.

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:43.326
So this person with the
Hobby-Hobby power,

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:45.096
the one who changed everybody--

00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:46.298
where are they now?

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.804
They must be pretty strong, huh?

00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:51.643
According to our
Tontatta scouting unit,

00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:54.816
she should be in the underground
trade port, for the time being.

00:12:54.916 --> 00:12:56.653
[COTTON, INHEL growl]

00:12:56.753 --> 00:13:00.360
[TOY SOLDIER] She's a special
officer in the Trebol Army.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.865
Her name is Sugar!

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:07.340
[TOY SOLDIER] She is a girl
who can transform anything

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.912
into a toy simply
by touching it.

00:13:10.012 --> 00:13:11.516
She appears to be a child,

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:13.987
but it seems that anyone
who eats the Hobby-Hobby Fruit

00:13:14.087 --> 00:13:17.027
stops aging the moment
that its power takes hold.

00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:18.830
Since she's such a vital figure,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.101
she is under the constant
protection of Trebol,

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.473
one of Doflamingo's
highest officers.

00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:25.944
[COTTON, INHEL grunt]

00:13:26.044 --> 00:13:29.017
I see. But we can avoid
a conflict with Trebol

00:13:29.117 --> 00:13:31.155
just as long as we
can knock out Sugar.

00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:32.424
That's correct!

00:13:32.525 --> 00:13:34.328
The plan is to scare
her out of her wits

00:13:34.428 --> 00:13:35.731
and make her pass out!

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:37.334
Operation:

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:38.169
Sugar!

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.438
Over-surprised!

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:41.877
Panic!

00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:45.617
And that is the meaning behind
SOP, my inquisitive friend.

00:13:45.718 --> 00:13:49.057
Wow! Now that is the kind of
name I can get behind, bro!

00:13:49.157 --> 00:13:50.426
[ROBIN grunts]

00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:53.365
If it's a little girl we're
fighting, no problem. Follow me!

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.771
--[DWARVES cheer]
--[ROBIN sighs]

00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:58.376
All right! I'm gettin'
all fired up!

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:01.415
Franky Hair Salon in the house!

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:05.156
Ya dig my Combat Hair?

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:06.960
Yay, Fraland!

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.864
Yay, Usoland!

00:14:08.964 --> 00:14:10.267
[DWARVES]
You guys are the best!

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:13.139
Aw, yeah! Usoland
is gonna save the day!

00:14:13.239 --> 00:14:17.013
Ain't no plan too
grand for Fraland!

00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:19.017
Now take us to the
underground, little dudes,

00:14:19.117 --> 00:14:21.088
'cause we are ready to go!

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:24.394
[DWARVES]
Yay, Usolanders!

00:14:41.729 --> 00:14:43.065
[panting]

00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:45.971
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Luffy runs
from one passage to the next,

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:49.779
frantically searching for the
exit to the Corrida Coliseum.

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.624
Hold on.

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:57.929
Forget the exit.

00:14:58.029 --> 00:14:59.497
Where am I?

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:01.435
[BARTOLOMEO]
So the plan is, someday

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:04.776
I'm gonna be Mister
Luffy's apprentice!

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:07.648
Well, it's more like my dream.

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:10.286
[LUFFY panting]

00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.223
--[MAN A] Close the door!
--[LUFFY yelps] The bathroom!

00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:14.461
Huh?

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:17.266
Huh? Rooster Head, it's me!

00:15:17.366 --> 00:15:19.038
Man, am I glad to see you!

00:15:19.138 --> 00:15:24.515
[BARTOLOMEO screams]
M-M-M-Mister Luffy?!

00:15:30.661 --> 00:15:32.196
[BARTOLOMEO]
Pull it together, Barto.

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:34.668
Mister Luffy's gonna be
the King of the Pirates.

00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:37.441
You gotta make a better
impression than this!

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:39.310
[LUFFY]
Oh, it's Bellamy!

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:50.033
[BARTOLOMEO screams]

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:51.167
[BARTOLOMEO]
He's too radiant!

00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:54.141
It's-it's like
staring at the sun!

00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:55.944
Hey, Mister Luffy?

00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:57.915
I don't remember what happened.

00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.652
Did you get to see Mister Zoro?

00:15:59.752 --> 00:16:00.954
Yeah, I sure did!

00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:02.123
Thanks for the help.

00:16:02.223 --> 00:16:04.127
[BARTOLOMEO whimpers]
It was my pleasure!

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:06.632
Anyway, I gotta get
somewhere quick, see?

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.469
But I can't find the exit.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.672
Think you can help again?

00:16:09.772 --> 00:16:11.475
There is no exit.

00:16:11.576 --> 00:16:13.379
You have to keep on fighting.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:15.316
Uh! Hold on.

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:18.657
Bellamy... why
are you so beat up?

00:16:18.757 --> 00:16:20.292
Never mind that.

00:16:20.392 --> 00:16:22.497
I'm telling you, there's no
escape from this place

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:24.367
unless they want you to leave.

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:26.772
You might as well stop looking
and give up hope.

00:16:26.872 --> 00:16:28.610
[LUFFY]
There's no way out? How?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.846
There was a way in!

00:16:29.946 --> 00:16:31.750
It's an emergency!

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.651
[BELLAMY]
Tch.

00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:34.354
You work for Doflamingo, right?

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:35.758
C'mon!

00:16:35.858 --> 00:16:38.564
Please! You gotta
know a secret way out!

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.400
[BELLAMY]
Work for Doflamingo?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.906
I wasn't even good
enough to be his flunky.

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:46.779
Bellamy, my friends
need my help!

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:49.284
[BELLAMY growls]

00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:53.860
I'm looking to get
outta this place myself.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.666
If you follow me,
maybe you'll get out, too,

00:16:56.766 --> 00:16:58.704
but no promises.

00:16:58.804 --> 00:17:02.143
Really? Thanks, buddy!
Glad you're showing me the way!

00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:04.548
I'm not "showing"
you a damn thing.

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.853
I just won't
stop you, that's all.

00:17:06.953 --> 00:17:08.488
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.296
You're not telling me
to betray my boss, are you?

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:17.708
Even now...
I'm loyal to Doflamingo!

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:20.613
No matter what,
I'll always respect him.

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:22.751
C'mon, man.
Just a second ago, you--

00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:26.291
I don't care! I've got
my own honor to uphold!

00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:28.630
That's fine!
I'll follow you out.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.366
[BELLAMY, BARTOLOMEO gasp]

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:33.573
But wait! What about the
Flame-Flame Fruit, Mister Luffy?

00:17:33.673 --> 00:17:36.546
There's one guy I hope
doesn't win, but it's fine.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.850
The lives of my friends
matter way more!

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.522
Don't worry! I'll take
care of that for you!

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:44.428
In fact, that was my plan
from the very start of things!

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:45.764
I knew you'd want a keepsake

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:47.033
from your dear,
departed brother,

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:48.804
so I was gonna win it
and then, give it to you!

00:17:48.904 --> 00:17:50.640
Really? Do you mean it?

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.380
Of course! It was
destined to belong to you!

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.621
Uh, you're getting
hard to understand.

00:17:57.721 --> 00:17:59.291
[BARTOLOMEO]
Don't you worry about 'nothin!

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:00.927
Just go and save the day

00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:03.666
and let old Barto take care
of the tournament for ya!

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.403
Why are you telling
that to the wall?

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:07.039
[LUFFY]
Thanks! You're awesome, buddy!

00:18:10.413 --> 00:18:14.621
[footsteps]

00:18:33.927 --> 00:18:36.164
[SABO] If you think you're
getting the Flame-Flame Fruit,

00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:37.466
you're wrong.

00:18:40.072 --> 00:18:41.274
Sorry, Luffy.

00:18:41.374 --> 00:18:42.578
It's mine.

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:43.647
[LUFFY grunts]

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:44.949
[BARTOLOMEO grunts]
Oh, yeah?

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.184
Ya wanna fight?

00:18:46.284 --> 00:18:49.157
Listen up! I dunno who
the hell you think you are,

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:52.096
but that's "Mister Luffy"
to you, ya damn punk!

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:55.135
The Flame-Flame Fruit belonged
to his brother, Fire Fist Ace,

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.508
so nobody deserves to
have it more than him!

00:18:57.608 --> 00:19:01.716
Also, he's gonna be King of
the Pirates one day, ya jackass!

00:19:01.816 --> 00:19:04.420
[SABO] I know.
I've known that for years.

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.726
[BARTOLOMEO groans]

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:15.342
Hey, what's your deal?!

00:19:15.442 --> 00:19:19.183
You show up outta nowhere and
tell me I can't have the fruit?

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:34.848
Uh? This moron's pissing me off!

00:19:34.948 --> 00:19:37.487
He got a grudge against
Mister Luffy, or what?

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:39.926
Look! You're upsetting
him, you jerk!

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:43.365
[inaudible]

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:51.114
[LUFFY gasps]

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.470
It's you.

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:04.875
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:07.681
[LUFFY gasps]

00:20:07.781 --> 00:20:10.721
[whimpers]

00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:12.691

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:20.674
[cries]

00:20:20.774 --> 00:20:23.145
Luffy!

00:20:23.245 --> 00:20:28.255
[LUFFY sobbing]

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:34.868
[ZORO]
You got outta the damn place,

00:20:34.968 --> 00:20:37.373
why are you crying?

00:20:37.473 --> 00:20:39.579
[MARINE A] What d'you mean you
can't find the Pirate Hunter?

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:40.814
He was right here!

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:42.618
Call the Vice-Admiral, hurry!

00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:44.287
[MARINE B]
Yes, sir!

00:20:47.193 --> 00:20:48.829
[KIN'EMON]
It seems my flawless disguises

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.703
have fooled the Navy into
thinking we're naught but toys!

00:20:51.803 --> 00:20:53.171
[ZORO]
Flawless, my ass!

00:20:53.271 --> 00:20:56.846
Look how much we stick out!
These costumes are weird!

00:20:56.946 --> 00:20:59.852
[KIN'EMON] But I chose all
the best animals! Like carp!

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:00.720
Carp are great!

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.461
[LUFFY sobbing]

00:21:04.562 --> 00:21:07.433
[ZORO] Stop crying already!
You wanna save Traffy or not?

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:10.607
[LUFFY sobbing]
I'll save Traffy.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:12.611
And I'll kick Mingo's ass.

00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:15.784
Now I know the Flame-Flame
Fruit will be in good hands.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:17.754
[ZORO]
What does that mean?

00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:31.783
[KOALA] I heard Robin's
in Dressrosa, too.

00:21:31.883 --> 00:21:35.255
Ah, it's been forever.
Hope I can see her.

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:40.432
[KOALA]
I'm glad you got to see Luffy.

00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:45.743
[SABO] Yeah. I was afraid
he was gonna punch me. [sniffs]

00:21:45.843 --> 00:21:48.015
[KOALA giggles]
Are you crying?

00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:50.987
[SABO]
What?! I don't cry!

00:21:51.088 --> 00:21:53.492
[KOALA chuckles]
You're wondering if

00:21:53.593 --> 00:21:54.728
you could've saved him

00:21:54.828 --> 00:21:56.766
if you'd been there, too?

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.301
[SABO grunts]

00:22:00.139 --> 00:22:01.375
[KOALA]
No one can say.

00:22:01.475 --> 00:22:02.778
Don't blame yourself.

00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:04.180
[SABO]
All right.

00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:08.556
[KOALA chuckles]

00:22:09.892 --> 00:22:11.161
[SABO]
Let me know as soon as you have

00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:12.897
more info on this
underground place.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.166
[KOALA]
Okay.

00:22:16.639 --> 00:22:18.308
[SABO]
In the meantime,

00:22:18.408 --> 00:22:21.347
I'll be taking back
that fruit for you, Ace.

00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:29.831
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:32.872 --> 00:22:37.982
[SABO] Luffy and I
will carry on your will.

00:22:38.082 --> 00:22:42.558
[LUFFY whimpers] I never
thought he might still be alive!

00:22:42.658 --> 00:22:45.295
[ZORO] Who the hell
are you talkin' about?!

00:22:47.232 --> 00:22:50.239
[LUFFY]
I was sure he died...

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:53.145
...all those years ago.

00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:57.887
But all this time,
he was out there.

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:17.259
[NARRATOR] After his
fateful reunion with Sabo,

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.366
Luffy races to the
palace to stop Doflamingo.

00:23:20.466 --> 00:23:22.838
Meanwhile, the hero
Usoland rushes through

00:23:22.938 --> 00:23:25.644
the underground tunnels
to begin Operation SOP.

00:23:25.744 --> 00:23:27.346
What he finds is another world

00:23:27.446 --> 00:23:30.185
that represents the dark
underbelly of Dressrosa.

00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:31.989
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.089 --> 00:23:36.364
"Operation SOP Starts!
Usoland Charges Forth!"

00:23:36.464 --> 00:23:39.103
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
