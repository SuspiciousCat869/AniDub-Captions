1
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,590
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,327
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,929
in search of the One Piece,

4
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,931
the legendary treasure
left behind by Gold Roger,

5
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,466
King of the Pirates.

6
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,236
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

7
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,904
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

8
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,907
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

9
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,677
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

10
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,312
they capture the
unwanted attention

11
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,913
of the World Government,

12
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,850
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

13
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,653
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

14
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,990
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

15
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,193
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

16
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:17,964
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

17
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,568
[NARRATOR]
The battle of Marineford

18
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,470
ended with a Navy victory.

19
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,674
Unable to save Ace's life,
Luffy fell into despair.

20
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,077
But this is a story
from another time.

21
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,446
Ten years ago,
when the brothers ran wild

22
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,048
with dreams of a world
full of adventure.

23
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,187
[LUFFY]
"To the Sea Someday!

24
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,622
The Pledge of the Three Brats!"

25
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,995
[LUFFY yells]
Here I go!

26
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,597
All right, Gum-Gum...

27
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,365
...and Pistol!

28
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,300
Huh?

29
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,668
[gasps]

30
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,340
Would you pull it
together already?

31
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,142
Why do all your moves
suck so much, huh?

32
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,843
That's one for Ace.

33
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:15,589
[BOTH grunting]

34
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,425
[ACE]
I won't lose a fight to anyone.

35
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,595
Sorry, Sabo, but that
goes for you, too.

36
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,097
[SABO]
I'm still too weak.

37
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,466
I can't stop till I'm
stronger than Ace--

38
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,801
till I'm the strongest
in the world.

39
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,304
[BOTH grunt]

40
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,238
[gasps]

41
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,074
I guess that's two
wins for me. Heh.

42
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,610
[SABO yells]

43
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,480
[SABO groans]

44
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,017
Dammit!

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,788
D'aw! It's always so
close when they fight!

46
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,356
What's the deal?

47
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,525
Sabo! You and me--let's do this!

48
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,597
Last chance to turn back!

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,098
This is gonna hurt, you know!

50
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,001
[LUFFY chuckles]
Gum-Gum Shield!

51
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,836
Not this again.

52
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,938
Here goes!

53
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,308
What, does he think I'm
just gonna run into him?

54
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,776
--This should be fun.
--Whoa, whoa, wait!

55
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,012
No, that's cheating! Stop it!

56
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:18,585
[LUFFY groaning]

57
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:22,255
[sighs] Just give it up
with the rubber crap.

58
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,159
Or at least learn to fight
like a normal person first.

59
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,327
No way! I was so close!

60
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:31,098
Just you wait, it's gonna be
awesome when I get it right!

61
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,666
C'mon, one more try!

62
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,700
Sorry, man.

63
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,003
You know the rules--
a hundred matches a day.

64
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,471
You can try it tomorrow.

65
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,508
[SABO] Luffy lost 50
times to both of us.

66
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:45,078
Me versus Ace
looks like 24 to 26.

67
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Lost by two points. So close!

68
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,083
You just win 'cause
you're older.

69
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,752
I'm telling you, when I turn
ten, I'm gonna kick your butts!

70
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,121
You do realize we'll
be 13 then, right?

71
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,723
Anyway, let's go look
for something to eat.

72
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,633
That looks yummy.

73
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,936
I could eat crocodile every day!

74
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,639
Okay, but make sure he
doesn't eat you this time.

75
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,308
You're lucky you got
swallowed whole before.

76
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,079
Better safe than sorry, huh?

77
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,614
You can't swim, so stay
up here and watch.

78
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,115
Crocodile meat!

79
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,117
[SABO screams]

80
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,385
If you don't die,
I'm so gonna kill you!

81
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,662
[NARRATOR] The harsh
environment of Mount Corvo

82
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,032
made the three boys
grow stronger each day.

83
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,643
[NARRATOR] To the north of
their forest playground,

84
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:54,114
the dirty dealings of Gray
Terminal continued as usual.

85
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,184
[NARRATOR] And even
further north than that,

86
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,020
there was a city with
a solid stone wall,

87
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,623
handily keeping the nearby
criminals at arm's length.

88
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,296
[NARRATOR] The only entrance
from the junkyard below

89
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,699
is called the Great Gate.

90
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:14,268
Twice a day, mountains
of discarded trash

91
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,570
from all over the country
are carried through it

92
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,506
and dumped into Gray Terminal.

93
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,408
--[SCAVENGERS chuckle]
--Here it comes.

94
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,010
Let's go! Treasure huntin' time!

95
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,480
[NARRATOR] From time to time,
residents of Gray Terminal

96
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:30,684
will enter the city to sell
what they call "recycled goods."

97
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,091
[GUARD A]
Huh? Hey, wait!

98
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,792
What's in that package?

99
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,697
Crocodile skin. Want it?

100
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:44,898
[GUARD A]
What?

101
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,668
[GUARD A gasps]
G-Go ahead!

102
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,306
[NARRATOR] Beyond the
Great Gate is a boulevard,

103
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,677
through which everyone
entering the city must pass.

104
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,379
It leads to Edge Town.

105
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,687
[NARRATOR] Edge Town, populated
by thugs and criminals,

106
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,190
lacks the refinement seen
in the rest of the city.

107
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,030
Hey there, buddy.

108
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,265
Need some help with
that heavy package?

109
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,801
[HOODLUMS chuckle]

110
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,805
Hey! Answer me
when I speak to you!

111
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,140
[ACE]
Buzz off.

112
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,941
What?

113
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,609
[HOODLUMS gasp]

114
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,179
You're dead!

115
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,814
Gotta pick your targets
more carefully!

116
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,619
You might get more than
you bargained for.

117
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,987
[HOODLUMS gasp]

118
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,156
Aw, damn it, not them! Look out!

119
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,325
[ACE]
No mercy!

120
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,026
[SABO, LUFFY]
All right!

121
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,795
--[thudding]
--[HOODLUMS groaning]

122
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,638
[CROWD chattering]

123
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,345
[NARRATOR]
In the middle of the city,

124
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,981
another stone wall
reaches to the skies.

125
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,318
This one encloses High Town,
which separates those

126
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,888
with noble blood from
their "lessor" neighbors.

127
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,826
[NARRATOR] This is the shining
jewel of the Goa Kingdom.

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,296
Said to be the most beautiful
country in all of the East Blue,

129
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,499
not a hint of trash can
be found on its streets.

130
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,271
[NARRATOR] Windmill Village
can make no such claim.

131
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:34,107
And although it's technically
a part of the Goa Kingdom,

132
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,109
the fact is often
swept under the rug

133
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,979
by its more wealthy inhabitants.

134
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,449
[CROWD chattering]

135
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:45,486
[SABO] I told you they'd
love that crocodile skin.

136
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,821
Our pirate savings
are really piling up!

137
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,323
[LUFFY]
Fine, but I'm hungry!

138
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,159
[ACE]
Hold on, we're almost there.

139
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:54,194
I hear this place has
the best ramen noodles

140
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:55,262
you've ever tasted.

141
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:57,664
[SABO chuckles]
Well, that's not saying much.

142
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,700
I've never even
heard of the stuff.

143
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:03,103
[LUFFY] I'll eat dirt
at this point! Just hurry!

144
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,844
We're here.

145
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,980
Hello, may I help you?

146
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,018
[gasps] Oh, my goodness,
this will not do, sir!

147
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,285
Forgive my bluntness,

148
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:20,854
but we simply do not
serve your kind.

149
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,959
[SABO]
The VIP room, please.

150
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,327
But that mark-- It can't be!

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,162
Please excuse my
impertinence, sir.

152
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,432
We would be honored to have
a noble such as yourself

153
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,666
grace our establishment.

154
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,302
Give me but a moment and
I'll gladly prepare a room.

155
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,640
That's pretty handy!

156
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,141
Where did you get that thing?

157
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,478
Oh, uh, yeah, it's weird,
I found it lying on the street.

158
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,588
[WAITRESS A] Three bowls of
ramen. Thank you for waiting.

159
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,122
Enjoy your meal.

160
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,493
So, this is ramen, huh?

161
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,028
Whoa, looks good!

162
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,198
Well, eat it already!

163
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,505
Took the words
right outta my mouth!

164
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,344
Seconds, please--

165
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,481
Ahem. We require seconds.

166
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,816
Three more bowls, post haste!

167
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,752
[WAITRESS A]
Yes, sir! On the way!

168
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,820
[SABO]
Three more!

169
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,357
[WAITRESS A]
Uh, yes, sir!

170
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,424
[SABO]
Three more!

171
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,525
[WAITRESS A]
Uh, right, just a moment!

172
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:35,962
[WAITRESS A panting]

173
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,164
[SABO]
More!

174
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:41,635
[WAITRESS A panting]

[RAMEN MAN A]
Are you sure?

181
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,255
Sir, I think we need to talk.

They found us out!

Yeah! Book it!

It's a dine and dash!

Catch those criminals!

187
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,165
Ahh. Wow, ramen sure is good!

188
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,600
[ACE]
I know, right? Worth it!

189
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:14,635

Mm-hmm!

"Criminals"?

191
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,771

They're just kids!

[CROWD gasps]

193
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,142
Damn it, how did
those little pests

194
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,443
sneak through the gate again?

195
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,913
I've had enough of their
antics for a lifetime!

196
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,348
Don't let them get away!

197
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:31,384
I don't care if they're kids!
They belong in a damn jail!

198
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,923
[WAITRESS A] Did they realize
they were on the fourth floor?

199
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,259
Because that is a long fall.

200
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,659
The window is a mess.

201
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,163
but we lost 26 bowls
of ramen, too!

202
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,498
Sir, look at this.

203
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,533

Huh? Wait, Sabo?

00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,016
I can't believe it's him!

208

Please, come back!

Let's go home!

The hell is this?

212
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,859
Are you friends with
that old dude, Sabo?

213
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,861
I think he knows you.

214
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,630
He's confusing me with
someone else, that's all.

215
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,268
[gasps] No! Sabo, come back!

216
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,346
Sabo.

217
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,941
You're wrong!
I'm not hiding anything!

[LUFFY]
Oh, that's cool, then.

00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,980
Come on, how stupid can you get?

00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,748
He's full of it!

221
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:12,485
Dammit, Sabo, we can't keep
secrets from each other!

222
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,488

So, talk!

223
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:21,628
There's nothing
for me to tell you.

You trying to pick a fight
with me? Spit it out already!

just stop killing me!

[LUFFY]
Huh?!

227
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,507
[ACE]
The son of a noble?

228
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,411
[ACE, LUFFY]
Who is?

229
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,879
I am!

230
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,916
[BOTH]
Hmm. So?

231
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,784
If you don't care,
then why did you ask me?

232
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,825
[SABO] The truth is, both my
parents are still alive.

233
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,993
So yeah, I'm not an orphan.

234
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:56,430
That means I lied about growing
up in Gray Terminal, too.

235
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,532
And that guy who was
calling out to me...

236
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:01,469
[SABO]
That was my dad.

238
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:04,704
[SABO]
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,141
I know I've been lying to you
guys for a long time now.

240
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,744
Well, he said he's sorry,
so we gotta forgive him.

241
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:14,314
I'm not forgiving anyone
till I hear the whole story.

242
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,417
If you're really
from a noble family,

243
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,286
why would you want to live
in some crappy junk heap?

244
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,490
'Cause I ran away
from home, that's why.

[SABO'S DAD]
You understand, don't you, Sabo?

247
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,803
[SABO'S DAD] A noble must
be a gentleman, educated,

248
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,671
well-mannered, and wise.

249
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,407
And then, when you're older,

250
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,608
you can marry a girl
from a royal family.

251
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,278
That will make Mommy
and Daddy very happy.

252
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,414
Of course, I'm sure
you'll be very happy, too.

253
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,317
All I have to do is study
and meet the right girl?

254
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,953
Then everybody will be
happy as long as we live?

255
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,022

Mm. If you work very hard at it.

00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,092
Good boy, Sabo.

about the crew!

punished severely for this.

to make things right.

Shall we go to the doctor

to make sure your
son isn't injured?

303
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:18,765

they love their money...

...their property...
their status...

305
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,871
[SABO]
...but not their son.

306
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,944
[SABO] If I couldn't
marry into a royal family,

307
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,511
I was useless to them.

308
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,414
They tried to teach me
culture and literature

309
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,316
and all that stuff...

310
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,184
...but I guess I didn't
learn fast enough,

311
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:40,154
'cause they were always
arguing and getting mad.

312
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:43,524
That family had no place
for someone like me.

313
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:45,592
I know you guys have it worse,

314
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,628
but even if I had parents,
I was still alone.

315
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:52,600
[SABO'S DAD] I heard that you've
been sneaking out behind my back

316
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,834
going goodness knows where.

317
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,436
I shouldn't have to
tell you this,

318
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,908
but stay away from Gray Terminal
if you know what's good for you.

319
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,110
We nobles are privileged
to live in High Town

320
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,444
with the king and his family.

321
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,681
It's a life the people down
there can only dream of.

322
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:11,885
By the same token, you do not
belong in their world.

324
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,833
Hm? What? You again?

325
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:27,668
I dunno where your parents are,

326
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:30,070
but someone's gonna string you
up by those suspenders of yours

327
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,672
if you keep hanging around here.

00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,974
[HOODLUMS laughing]

329
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,909
Please, tell me another story!

00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,579
I wanna hear about all the
different countries you've seen!

[MAN C laughs]

334
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,521
[MAN C] You're a weird kid,

00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,923

Yeah, take a seat.

336
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,323
Okay!

337
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,495
Well, at least the
people in Gray Terminal

338
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,763
know what it means to be free.

339
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,166
If the nobles in High Town
didn't spend their whole lives

340
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,934
licking the boots
of the royal family,

341
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,970
maybe they'd look up and see
that there's more to the world.

342
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,674
Man, I had no idea.

343
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,343
[SABO]
Ace, Luffy, listen.

344
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,847
The three of us,
we're gonna leave this country.

345
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,950
We're gonna sail the seas
and see the world.

346
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,319
And once I've done it all,

347
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,455
I'm gonna write a book
for kids like me.

348
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,824
'Cause studying is fun when
you're learning about adventure!

349
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:25,626
And we're gonna
have lots of 'em.

350
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:28,829
We're gonna be pirates!

351
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,799
[BOTH chuckle]

352
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,169
[ACE]
You don't gotta tell me!

353
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:36,970
I'm gonna be a pirate anyway!

354
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,973
I'll be so tough that
all the other pirates

355
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,775
and all the Marines
will bow at my feet.

356
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:43,477
Everyone in the world
will know my name!

357
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,980
That's gonna be the legacy
I leave behind when I die!

358
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,682
I don't care if people hate me.

359
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,084
I don't care if they wish
I'd never been born.

360
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,586
But they won't ignore me.

361
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,256
That's what it
means to be strong!

362
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,157
To be a great pirate!

363
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,827
I won't ever lose and
I won't ever run away!

364
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,364
Who cares if the world fears me
or respects me or whatever.

365
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:06,032
I'm gonna be a legend!

366
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,334
[chuckles]

367
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,803
[LUFFY] Then I know
what I'm gonna be, too!

368
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:16,676
The king of the pirates!

369
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,746
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,916
[laughing]

371
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,018
You dork.

372
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,587
Just gotta try and
show me up, don'tcha?

373
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,089
[SABO laughs]

374
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,091
I dunno if you'll
be a king or not,

375
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,692
but you're gonna do
something crazy,

376
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,961
I know that much for sure!

377
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:38,265
Uh-- We all wanna be pirates
together, though, don't we?

378
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,699
We're only saving for one ship,

379
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:43,003
but what if all three
of us wanna be captain?

380
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,971
Damn it, I never
thought of that.

381
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:48,642
Sabo, I always figured you'd
be the navigator on my ship.

382
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,911
You guys are welcome
to join my crew!

383
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:52,079
[ACE, SABO]
No thanks!

384
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,315
Huh? But I was nice
about it and everything!

385
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,119
Also, I'm gonna be the king,
so I gotta be the boss!

386
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:00,588
[ACE] Who wants a
crybaby captain? Not me.

387
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:01,421
[SABO]
Me neither!

388
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,157
[LUFFY]
What did you call me?!

389
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:04,992
Whatever.

390
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,793
[ACE chuckles]
You gave up?

391
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,797
[SABO laughs] Man, you're always
good for a laugh, aren't you?

392
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,165
[ACE, SABO, LUFFY laughing]

393
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:17,938
[ACE] Well, we'll figure it
out when the time comes.

394
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:21,141
Maybe we'll leave on one ship
and maybe we'll leave on three.

395
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:25,913
[LUFFY] Ooh! You stole
that from Dadan, huh?

396
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:28,215
Lemme tell you guys a secret.

397
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:33,821
[ACE] All it takes to become
brothers is to share some saké!

398
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:36,523
Whoa, really? That's so cool!

399
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,359
[ACE]
We may sail in different seas,

400
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:40,927
with different crews
on different ships.

401
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:44,364
But wherever we go and
whatever adventures we have,

402
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:48,668
we'll always be brothers,
and nobody can take that away.

403
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,803
[giggles]

404
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:50,971
[ACE]
Heh.

405
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:54,174
From now on, we're honest
to goodness brothers.

406
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,809
Cheers to that!

407
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,484
[ALL]
Brothers!

408
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,995
[NARRATOR] The antics
of Luffy and his friends

409
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:17,131
began to test Dadan's patience,

410
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:19,666
and when Garp
unexpectedly pays a visit,

411
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,002
the situation becomes desperate.

412
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,903
Determined to stay
on their path,

413
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:27,474
the three boys must learn to
stand on their own two feet.

414
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,143
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

415
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,411
"Leaving the Dadan
Family For Good?!

416
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,614
The Kids' Hideout
Has Been Built!"

417
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:36,349
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
