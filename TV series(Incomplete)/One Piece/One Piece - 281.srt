1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,137
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,573
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,341
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,644
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,112
You want my treasure?

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,213
You can have it!

7
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,216
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,419
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,490
These words lured men to
the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,759
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,195
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,781
Hey, Robin! We'll save you!
No matter what!

13
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,287
Look! The drawbridge
is lowering!

14
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,771
Robin. It must have
been hard for you.

15
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:28,682
But you're not alone
anymore. You have us now!

16
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,518
Never in a million years
would Nami kill Usopp!

17
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,488
She wouldn't do
that to her friends!

18
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,091
What was that
about friends, Luffy?

19
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:38,225
Nami!

20
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,727
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,095
What are we doing here?

22
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,365
You're our friend!
We came to get you.

23
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,733
What a pest.

24
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,534
Nami?

25
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,370
Friends huh?
Don't make me laugh.

26
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,372
You're just pathetic enough
to deserve each other.

27
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,631
Geez Nami.

28
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,799
You sure know how
to trash a place.

29
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,536
Hey. What's wrong?

30
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,739
Nothing. I'm just
resting a little. That's all.

31
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,776
You mean to tell me that
pouring over a treasure map,

32
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,778
after wrecking a
house is how you relax?

33
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,417
You're not fooling me.
Now fess up already.

34
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,118
What's bothering you?

35
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:41,087
Something happened to
make me mad. It's nothing.

36
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,792
Those guys. Who are they?

37
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,293
You know?

38
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,829
Yeah. I met some Captain guy.

39
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,498
He seemed kind
of liar-ish though.

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,636
Nami. I heard you
smiled with them.

41
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,372
We both know
that's rare for you.

42
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,608
As a matter of fact, I haven't
seen you smile in years.

43
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,080
C'mon! Tell me
who these guys are!

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,687
It's okay. You can tell
me anything, remember?

45
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,063
I had planned to
forget about them.

46
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,804
I thought I could just
erase them from my mind.

47
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,439
Don't you have any honor?

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,742
Those men are your friends!

49
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,132
If it were possible,

50
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:02,402
I'd join up with those guys
and sail around the world.

51
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,711
Now I see.

52
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,782
Yeah, that would hit her hard.

53
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,184
To think that someone
actually showed up for her.

54
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,157
Friends.

55
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:33,266
That word means pain.
It breaks her heart.

56
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,570
What's wrong, little girl?

57
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,712
I bet it's the village.
You want it left alone?

58
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,717
Then how about this?

59
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,052
Let's make an agreement, okay?

60
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,354
An agreement?

61
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,488
That's right.

62
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,291
Gather up 100 million
berries, then bring it to me.

63
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:59,426
Do so and I will
let your village go,

64
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,795
in addition to giving
you your freedom.

65
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,696
Promise?

66
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,466
I promise. And I'm
the kind of fish-man

67
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:09,036
who would rather die than break
an agreement concerning money.

68
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,238
I don't even care
how long it takes you,

69
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,240
I will honor our agreement.

70
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,780
I'm going to save
100 million berries!

71
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,251
Arlong!

72
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,422
Ah. What seems to
be the problem,

73
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,457
O-skilled-surveyor of ours?

74
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,059
Why the sour face?

75
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,563
Those Marine maggots
you keep on the payroll

76
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,400
stole every last berry I had!

77
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,834
What happened to all
that crap about dying

78
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,671
before you'd ever break a
promise when it comes to money?

79
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,638
Bastard!

80
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,040
Refresh my memory.

81
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,274
Did I break a promise?

82
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,341
Don't play dumb with me!

83
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,510
I know that you teamed
up with the Marines to--!

84
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,750
Just when did I break that
promise? Speak up girl.

85
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,461
Damn you. Damn you! Damn you!

86
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:13,467
Too bad. All your
stolen money got stolen.

87
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,036
That certainly is unfortunate.

88
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,805
But a deal is a deal, Nami.

89
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,541
If you can't come up
with 100 million berries,

90
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,209
then both you and
your village stay

91
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,078
in my possession indefinitely.

92
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,181
Well, you know the terms. Hmm?

93
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,615
You pig!

94
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,053
It's only 100 million berries!

95
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,488
Start saving again and
you'll have it in no time!

96
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,028
Or, are you gonna run out on me?

97
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,464
Listen.

98
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,700
If you do that, I'll kill
everyone in that village.

99
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,301
Do you understand me?

100
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,140
Nami.

101
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,476
We agreed we would never
tell you that we knew.

102
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,379
If you thought all of us
were counting on you,

103
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,780
you would be
bound by guilt never

104
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,782
to leave his gang for
fear of letting us down.

105
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,357
We've had enough!

106
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,225
Take up arms!

107
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,226
It's time to fight!

108
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,429
We promised we wouldn't
live our lives in vain!

109
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,597
No matter the pain

110
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,300
or humiliation we
endured under Arlong,

111
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,335
we swore to fight the long fight

112
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,437
so Nami could
meet their demands!

113
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,072
But they lied!

114
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,608
They never intended to
keep their end of the deal.

115
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:31,045
Instead they stole our
only chance at freedom!

116
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,279
So now.

117
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,315
We should make
those filthy fishmen pay

118
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:37,051
for the years they manipulated
that kind young girl!

119
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,018
Am I right?

120
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:40,321
We were always ready
to fight those monsters!

121
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,322
Yeah!!

122
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,423
Everybody! Wait!

123
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,526
Nami!

124
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,598
Calm down!

125
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,466
It's not that much money!

126
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,301
I can make it back in no time!

127
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,437
I'll take care of it,
don't worry!

128
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,672
It'll be easy this time!

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:03,443
I'm used to it! I'll be fine!
Just relax! Everything is okay!

130
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,780
Hey. It's nothing
compared to back then.

131
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,385
It's okay! You don't
need to save me!

132
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:15,422
C'mon everyone!
I'm perfectly fine!

133
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,064
You've done enough.

134
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,067
You have to know
that there is no point now.

135
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,569
You struggled so hard,

136
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,505
carrying our lives on
your back this whole time.

137
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,074
I can only imagine that
joining them must have been

138
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,244
more painful than being
stabbed through the heart.

139
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,214
You fought very well.

140
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,385
Genzo.

141
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,459
Set yourself free
from this village.

142
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,095
Genzo!

143
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,830
Nami. Do it.

144
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,699
What? Nojiko!

145
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,833
Nami.

146
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,701
Go on.

147
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,071
You are an exceptional
young woman.

148
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,739
And you have a dream.

149
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,408
Everyone! Listen!

150
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,710
I won't let you go!

151
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,145
Just stay right there!

152
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:16,216
I'm not going to let anyone
else get hurt by them!

153
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,287
You'll all die.

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,788
We know that.

155
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:32,265
Nami. It's no use.
We've made up our minds!

156
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,537
Get out of the way!

157
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,742
Move out!

158
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,445
We may not win but
we will give 'em hell!

159
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,646
Yeah!!

160
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,055
Arlong!

161
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:31,759
Arlong!

162
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,761
Arlong! Arlong!

163
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,195
Arlong!

164
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,237
Luffy.

165
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,542
What do you want?

166
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,611
You don't know
anything about this.

167
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,413
You don't know what's been
happening on this island

168
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,214
for the past eight years.

169
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,283
Nope. I don't.

170
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,820
This has nothing to do with you!

171
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,456
I told you to leave this place.

172
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,391
Yep. You sure did.

173
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,428
So leave! I told you to leave!

174
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:10,264
Just get out of here!
Get out of here now!

175
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:15,402
Go! Go away! Go! Go! Go!

176
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:40,427
Luffy. Help me.

177
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,645
Of course I will!

178
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,316
You better keep
your hands off my hat.

179
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,554
Luffy.

180
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,297
Let's go.

181
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,099
Right!

182
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,416
What the--?

183
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,421
Now which one of you is Arlong?

184
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,208
There's nowhere else to run!

185
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,579
You and me. Here. In the
highest level of Arlong Park.

186
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,717
What is this room? Lotta paper.

187
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,685
This isn't just any room.

188
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,621
This is the room
where I make Nami

189
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:16,423
draw all of her
sea charts for me.

190
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,292
The map room!

191
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,295
This is Nami's room?

192
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,262
These sea charts--

193
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,266
--are what she's worked
on all these years.

194
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,203
She will continue drawing her
sea charts for my own ambitions!

195
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,538
And once her charts give
me full knowledge of all the

196
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:37,511
world's oceans, we fishmen
will be totally invincible!

197
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,513
And the world
shall kneel before us!

198
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,784
The first step is this island.

199
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,620
Then we'll move on to
the whole East Blue.

200
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,592
You could never use her like me!

201
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,727
She would be wasted on you!

202
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,763
Use her?

203
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,667
What is that?

204
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,337
A desk?

205
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,674
What do you think you're doing?

206
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,644
Whoa! What's goin' on?

207
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,380
Why's all that stuff
being thrown out of there?

208
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,725
Stop it now!

209
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,563
The charts!

210
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,065
My charts!

211
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:43,644
Wow. This fight is
so freakin' intense.

212
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,513
Yeah. A fight to the death.

213
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,148
Definitely.

214
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:57,224
Thank you.

215
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,277
Now you've gone too far!

216
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,184
You keep jabbering on about
how much better fishmen are,

217
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,654
and how much you
need those sea charts.

218
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:30,090
I don't understand
anything about that stuff,

219
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:34,527
but I finally figured out
how to save her!

220
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,303
This room isn't
anything but her jail cell.

221
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,039
There's only one way
for Nami to escape.

222
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,440
I've got to tear
this place apart!

223
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,243
Gum-Gum...

224
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,381
...Battle Axe!

225
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,066
It's gonna collapse!

226
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,034
Everybody run for cover!

227
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,370
Big Sis! We gotta go!

228
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,638
But Luffy's still inside!

229
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:18,272
Big Sis!

230
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,073
We can't! Luffy's still--!

231
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,746
Luffy!

232
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,023
Luffy.

233
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,827
We gotta know who won.

234
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,063
With all that debris.
Looks like--

235
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:46,233
Luffy.

236
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,448
It's Luffy!

237
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,284
Big Bro!

238
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,196
He's just standing there.
What's wrong?

239
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,571
Nami!

240
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:35,649
Nami! You'll always
be my friend!

241
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,629
Yeah.

242
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,337
Back then, I was saved
by my truest friends.

243
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,075
This time, I'll be right beside
them, fighting for you.

244
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:05,212
So please. Believe in us.
Believe in Luffy!

245
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,314
He'll be sure to answer you.

246
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,585
Hey! Straw Hats!

247
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,720
Why are you all
just standing around?

248
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,729
Hey. What's with
that devious chuckle?

249
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,037
Let's go!

250
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:06,373
Oh, dear!

251
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,308
I'm out of soy sauce!

252
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:08,309
And here I was planning

253
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:10,544
on making some delicious
soy sauce meat steak,

254
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,246
meat salad, and meat
miso soup today!

255
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:15,549
Hello? I'm coming in!
Hey, Zoroyama!

256
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,084
I'm completely out of soy sauce!

257
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,219
Would you be a dearie
and spare me some?

258
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:22,523
Whoa! You startled me!

259
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,058
Are you training or something?

260
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:25,726
Heavens no, I wasn't training!

261
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,663
I'm preparing!
We are having sashimi today.

262
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,099
So, I was cutting up fish.

263
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,401
And the whole kitchen
along with 'em!

264
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,803
Oh, yeah! The soy sauce!

265
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:38,072
Unfortunately. I'm out, as well.

266
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,673
Sliced it in two, did ya?

267
00:20:41,842 --> 00:20:43,310
Stop it, ma'am!
You can't do that!

268
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,479
Oh, my word!
This ham is exquisite!

269
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,714
And this one with
the cheese wrapped

270
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,382
in ham is
simply to die for!

271
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,184
Now be a dear and
get me some jam!

272
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,251
Ma'am, I'm afraid
I can't do that!

273
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,787
And you can't bring rice
into the sampling section!

274
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,654
And why not, huh?

275
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,824
I see Luffizaki
doing it all the time!

276
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:58,792
She's always causing
us trouble here, too.

277
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,629
Can it, missie! Now bring me
some jam to put on this ham,

278
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:04,564
and make sure it's sweet
and tasty, ma'am! Got it?

279
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,601
It's that grabby
pervert, Sanjida!

280
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,104
Ladies! What's wrong?

281
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:13,474
It's just us girls here, right?
Hey, you! Come over here!

282
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,041
I wanna touch your butt!

283
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,245
Knock it off, you two!

284
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,513
Thank goodness!

285
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,583
It's the middle-aged woman of
once-a-month justice, Namijima!

286
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,650
Pushing her own faults aside,

287
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,352
she tells off the middle-aged
woman pirate gang

288
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,154
once a month for some reason.

289
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:31,291
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

290
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,227
Hey, Luffizaki! Great news!

291
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,495
The supermarket
by the train station

292
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,729
has some
amazing bargains!

293
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,164
Their meat is
freakin' cheap, too!

294
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,500
Even their meat?
Usokawa, are you serious?

295
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:41,101
Nope. Lying.
Here's the circular.

296
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:41,735
Aw, phooey!

297
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:42,803
But forget about all that.

298
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:43,804
Terrible news!

299
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,106
Chopamori and Sanjida
were caught red-handed.

300
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,240
I need some tea.

301
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:49,743
Oh, dear me! Is Namijima
out for monthly justice again?

302
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:53,113
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

303
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,315
Robino! Please let us hide here!

304
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,483
That crazy Namijima's
gonna kill us!

305
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,752
Oh! Excellent timing, you two!

306
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,387
I've been warning
you girls for months now

307
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,722
about how you handle your trash.

308
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:04,058
Please, separate and
sort out what's burnable.

309
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,526
It's better for the environment.

310
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,661
They can burn all of
it if they try harder!

311
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,430
Yeah! That's a
good point, Luffizaki!

312
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,699
It's a matter of spirit,
not the incinerator!

313
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,367
What a bunch of nonsense.

314
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,768
Goodness! Pickled vegetables?

315
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,104
Your pickled vegetables
are the best, Robino!

316
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:18,405
Really! I love them!

317
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,374
Oh, my! Then let's take
a break and have some,

318
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:23,043
along with this barley tea
I found in the fridge!

319
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:30,451
Robino speaking.
Yes, they're here. Sure.

320
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:33,320
Oh! Who was that, Robino?
Who called?

321
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,121
It was Namijima.

322
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:42,129
So, mind telling me what's up
with this month's rent?

323
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,764
Lovely landlord Namijima.

324
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,232
Would you be a
sweetheart and wait

325
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,234
until after the town
raffle tomorrow?

326
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,168
Hell no!

327
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,803
I'm going to go to
each of your employers

328
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,605
and collect the money
directly from them!

329
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:52,473
No, please!

330
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:53,540
Don't do it, Namijima!

331
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,674
Anything but that!

332
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,144
If you do, then tomorrow
will be our last day to live!

333
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,445
Fine by me.

334
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,116
Even as middle-aged women,

335
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:04,584
the strongest of all
of them is Namijima!
