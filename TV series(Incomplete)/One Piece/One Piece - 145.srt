00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,567
Promise me!

177
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,444
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

178
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,695
I promise.

179
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,739
Good. This is serious
business you two.

180
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,199
‐‐Good.
‐‐Great.

181
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,743
[NAMI]
Gee, thanks for the support!

182
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,453
Look, if one of you
causes trouble here,

183
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,288
we'll have to get
out of this town.

184
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,498
And if that happens,

185
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,083
then we'll never know how to
get to the sky island, right?

186
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,627
[LUFFY]
Yeah.

187
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,754
Whoa. He's messed up.

188
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,464
[LUFFY] Looks like
he fell off his horse.

189
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,007
[ZORO]
That's gotta hurt.

190
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,178
[LUFFY]
Looks like he's in pain too.

191
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,387
[ZORO]
No doubt.

192
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,140
Hey. Sorry to bother you.

193
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,642
But will you help me up?

194
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,228
[ZORO] What, are you not
in the mood to help yourself?

195
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
Luffy. Give me a hand.

196
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,564
Sure.

197
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,274
Up you go!

198
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,026
[DOC Q]
Hey, would ya look at that!

199
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm on my horse again.

200
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,657
I was a sickly child growing
up and never got better.

201
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,701
Now let's get out
of here, Stronger.

202
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,370
[LUFFY, ZORO]
The horse too?

203
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,331
[ZORO] We should put them
out of their misery.

204
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,499
[DOC Q]
Thanks again, pal.

205
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,000
Ya know I don't
have enough money

206
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,502
for a reward these days,

207
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,587
but care for an apple?

208
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,588
[ZORO]
Do you take us for idiots?

209
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,715
We'd never trust food
from someone like you.

210
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,384
Hey, look! Apples!

211
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,179
Luffy!

212
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,348
What the? What happened?

213
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,558
[CLERK] Some guys
took a few apples

214
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,767
from that freak on the horse,

215
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,187
and when they bit into
them, they exploded!

216
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,066
Oh no! Luffy! Spit it out!

217
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,693
Spit out the apple you just ate!

218
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,237
I already swallowed it!

219
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,530
What the hell'd you do that for?

220
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,491
[laughs]

221
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,409
No worries.

222
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,119
The boy isn't hurt.

223
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,870
[MAN C]
What happened?

224
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,540
[MAN D] I don't know,
but the inside's destroyed.

225
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,834
[DOC Q] If you had
eaten the bad one,

226
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,712
you would have died
on the first bite.

227
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,049
Heh! You're lucky.

228
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,219
[ONLOOKER A]
What is all this?

229
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,306
[ONLOOKER B]
It's Roshio's grave now.

230
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,558
[ONLOOKER A] It looks like
a war broke out here.

231
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,561
Did they fire a cannon into
the middle of town or something?

232
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,687
[ONLOOKER B]
Who knows?

233
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,772
Even the people who were
there and saw what happened

234
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,567
said they couldn't tell
exactly what was going on.

235
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,153
About the only thing
everyone knows for certain

236
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,405
is that Bellamy had
something to do with this.

237
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,157
[ONLOOKER A]
Bellamy the Hyena?

238
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,366
I think it's pretty obvious

239
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,244
that he's using the power
of one of the devil's fruits.

240
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,849
[NAMI]
What's the deal with this town?

241
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,516
I don't know.

242
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,143
Who really cares?

243
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,186
You should care

244
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,480
seeing as you were
almost killed for no reason.

245
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,107
Well that was bound to
happen sooner or later.

246
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,317
Have you lost your mind?

247
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,152
[BURGESS roars]

248
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,198
[laughs]

249
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,491
Oh great, look who's back.

250
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,160
How many victims
has he racked up now?

251
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,496
[MAN E] It's not like he's
a famous fugitive or anything.

252
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,664
Who do you think he is?

253
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,416
I don't care, and to be honest,
I don't want to know.

254
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,960
If that meathead wants
to be the fighting champion,

255
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,880
then go ahead and let him.

256
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,215
Fighting champion?

257
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,551
Hey, don't even
think about it you two!

258
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,552
Dammit.

259
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,512
I'm starting to wonder

260
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,848
if we can find any
useful information here.

261
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,186
[ZORO]
How about this place?

262
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,897
[LUFFY]
Uh, seems pretty quiet to me.

263
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,649
You can say that again.

264
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,567
This place is gorgeous!

265
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,861
To think such an oasis exists

266
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,905
in the middle of
this disgusting town.

267
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,906
[ZORO]
It's built above the water.

268
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,075
[LUFFY] That's great,
but there's no one here.

269
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,494
Although I can smell
that someone's cooking.

270
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,372
Excuse me!

271
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,667
Excuse me! I'm gonna have to
ask you all to leave please.

272
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,420
See, the entire hotel has been
rented out by Mr. Bellamy

273
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,546
and his guests,
and he's asked that we

274
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,215
tell other guests like
yourselves to go somewhere else.

275
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,093
So, uh, you must understand that
I have no say in the matter.

276
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,303
So, one man rented
out this entire place?

277
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,596
If Mr. Bellamy sees you here,

278
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,348
he'll have my head
removed from my body,

279
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,934
so please leave for my sake.

280
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,894
[LUFFY]
C'mon, I'm sure he won't mind.

281
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,563
Who is this Bellamy anyway?

282
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,565
[SARQUISS]
What's going on in here?

283
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,693
Who are these scumbags and what
are they doing in our hotel?

284
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,569
Mr. Sarquiss!

285
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,570
Welcome back!

286
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,280
I told them to leave,
but they won't listen!

287
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,197
I really don't care.

288
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,407
Just get rid of them!

289
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,951
We're paying a lot of money
to have this place to ourselves.

290
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,910
She's right.

291
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,204
Now get out of here
before I throw you out.

292
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,290
Hey, guys, would you
mind if I beat him up?

293
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,416
Luffy!

294
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,252
Ha! You're going to beat me up?

295
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,588
[laughs]
Hilarious!

296
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,632
Seriously though,
those are rags you're wearing.

297
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,800
Here.

298
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,012
Go buy some new rags so you
don't look like an orphan.

299
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,388
[LILY] Sarquiss,
you're wasting your money

300
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,265
by tossing it to
this bunch of losers.

301
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,433
[SARQUISS]
No kidding.

302
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,102
I should have just flushed it
down along with my lunch.

303
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,270
I'll take free money!

304
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,605
Let's go.

305
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,273
These jerks can't help us.

306
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,317
[LUFFY]
I can walk on my own, you know.

307
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,110
See you around.

308
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,613
[EDDY]
Sarquiss. Lily.

309
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,948
Just leave well enough alone.

310
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,534
[SARQUISS] Eddy,
we've been looking for you.

311
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,703
You know that
trash you ran into?

312
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,623
Seems that they've been doing
pretty well for themselves.

313
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,540
Look.

314
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,625
Not bad,

315
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,084
but they're nothing compared
to you and Bellamy.

316
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,085
Here.

317
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,171
But for ordinary scum
they can hold their own.

318
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,339
They still don't stand

319
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,133
a chance of surviving the
transition into the new era.

320
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,218
Wow.

321
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,305
His bounty is 30 million,
for such a little puke.

322
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,558
I'm sure Bellamy
will want to see this.

323
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,311
Man, that really pisses me off!

324
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,437
[TERRY]
That's a shame.

325
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,647
Cause you know.

326
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,233
Mock Town's economy depends
on pirates throwing money around

327
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,568
to show off power they
may or may not have.

328
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,738
What, so poor pirates aren't
allowed on the island?

329
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,199
Looks like there's
no way of calming you down.

330
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:45,783
Here.

331
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,535
This one's on the house.

332
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,327
Huh?

333
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,495
[TERRY]
Tough guys and degenerates

334
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,331
are our clientele here,
so trouble isn't hard to find.

335
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,084
You aren't gonna make it in this
town if ya let it bother ya.

336
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,503
You have to play it
safe when you can.

337
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,088
Here you go.

338
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,298
This whole town's
a real dump, ya know?

339
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,467
Of course, that's how
most level‐headed people

340
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,343
would think of it.

341
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,344
But unfortunately for you,

342
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,097
level‐headed people
are rare in these parts.

343
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,683
The wanted posters won't be on
the walls for a couple of days,

344
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,270
so you may want to skip town
sooner rather than later.

345
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,354
A couple days.

346
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,439
That doesn't give us much time.

347
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,399
Now here's a question.

348
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,650
‐‐Hey, fatso!
‐‐[BLACKBEARD] Hey, barkeep!

349
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,568
[TERRY]
Huh?

350
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,777
What's wrong?

351
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,987
‐‐[BLACKBEARD] This cherry pie
‐‐[LUFFY] This cherry pie

352
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,446
‐‐tastes friggin' delicious!
‐‐tastes friggin' horrible!

353
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,781
‐‐Huh?
‐‐Hm?

354
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,875
‐‐This is one of the
‐‐This is one of the

355
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,502
‐‐worst drinks I've ever tasted!
‐‐best drinks I've ever tasted!

356
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,713
I think there
may be something wrong

357
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,298
with your taste buds, kid.

358
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,342
I think there's somethin' wrong
with your big fat head.

359
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,177
Well, I'm not
the cook in this joint,

360
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,096
so I don't care
what you have to say.

361
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,431
Got it?

362
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,475
Hey, barkeep!
I'll take 50 steaks to go!

363
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,812
And I'll take 51 of those
delicious cherry pies to go.

364
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,231
Wait, make that 52 steaks!

365
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,774
[BLACKBEARD]
Better make that 53 pies.

366
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,234
[LUFFY]
Fifty‐four steaks!

367
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,527
[BLACKBEARD]
Fifty‐five pies!

368
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,695
[LUFFY]
Sixty steaks!

369
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,779
[BLACKBEARD]
Seventy pies!

370
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,405
[LUFFY]
Eighty!

371
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,364
[BLACKBEARD]
A hundred!

372
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,242
I'm gonna beat the
living crap out of you!

373
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,535
Do you two even
have the slightest idea

374
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,453
what you're fighting about?

375
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,413
Luffy, you promised, remember?

376
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,166
Besides, we don't have enough
money to buy dozens of steaks!

377
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,084
We aren't here to shop!

378
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,253
So then, are you a pirate?

379
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,255
Yeah. That's right.

380
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,757
How big's your bounty?

381
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,759
Thirty million.

382
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,595
Thirty million? For you?

383
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,805
I wouldn't believe it
even if I collected it!

384
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,224
Are you calling me
a liar you fat, hairy ape?

385
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,434
[ZORO]
Enough!

386
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,810
[TERRY]
We've got rules in this place,

387
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,646
and one of 'em's no fighting.

388
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,608
Here's your 50 cherry pies.
Now please, just walk away.

389
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,380
[BELLAMY] I'm looking for a
pirate that wears a straw hat.

390
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,382
[LUFFY]
Hmm?

391
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,676
[CUSTOMER A]
It's Bellamy!

392
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,348
Heh.

393
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,517
So you must
be Straw Hat Luffy,

394
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,477
worth a cool 30 million.

395
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,478
Who's this guy?

396
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,064
Looks like he has a bone
to pick with you, Luffy.

397
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,273
That must be that Bellamy guy

398
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,401
that rented out
the hotel we were at.

399
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,068
Did you hear that?

400
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,362
The kid's worth 30 million.

401
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,530
[CUSTOMER C]
No way.

402
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,572
[CUSTOMER B]
Tell me about it.

403
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,701
How come everyone
I meet in this town is so tall?

404
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
I'll take a glass
from the top shelf

405
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,706
and give the kid
whatever he wants.

406
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,249
Right.

407
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,292
[SARQUISS]
Look at this place.

408
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,837
This joint is packed solid!

409
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,213
[LILY]
This place is disgusting.

410
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,506
It smells like vomit.

411
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,675
[RIVERS] All you can
get here is cheap rum.

412
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,384
Look, Zoro.

413
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,553
It's those guys from earlier.

414
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,472
You'd be in a lot less pain

415
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,183
if you'd just offered
us your seats.

416
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,269
Pathetic harbor trash.

417
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,567
[CUSTOMER D]
It's him! "Big Knife" Sarquiss!

418
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,570
[CUSTOMER E] How much you wanna
bet he's looking for a fight?

419
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,655
[CUSTOMER D]
Oh great.

420
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,865
The whole gang is here.

421
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,409
There's no way that they stopped
in just for a bite to eat.

422
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,118
Drop it, man.

423
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,245
It has nothing to do with us.

424
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,247
What's Bellamy up to?

425
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,249
[SARQUISS]
The usual fun.

426
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,752
[BELLAMY]
Cheers.

427
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,587
Hey, thanks for the drink, pal!

428
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,087
You know what?

429
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,839
You're all right.

430
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,385
[gasps]

431
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,892
[CUSTOMER F]
He did it!

432
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,769
[laughs]

433
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,103
Brilliant move, Bellamy!

434
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,271
Just brilliant!

435
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,773
[laughs]

436
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,275
Huh?

437
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:52,446
What are you doing, punk?

438
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,492
[ZORO] That's the question
you should be asking yourself.

439
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,453
Zoro! Don't do it!

440
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,455
We still need to get
some information from‐‐

441
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,750
Quiet! If this guy wants
a fight, I'll give it to him.

442
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,671
[BELLAMY] So that's all
you've got for backup?

443
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,342
[laughs]

444
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,845
Now, are you ready
to take me on or not?

445
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,930
Heh...

446
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,889
[CUSTOMER G]
No way!

447
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,183
The kid just challenged Bellamy!

448
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,603
[CUSTOMER I]
He'll be slaughtered!

449
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,938
[laughs]

450
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,398
You've got it all wrong, kid.
This isn't a fight.

451
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,358
It's a test.

452
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,652
Now come on.
Let's see how strong you are.

453
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,487
Luffy, hold on!

454
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,656
Mister, we're trying
to get to the sky island.

455
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,534
Do you know anything about that?

456
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,749
Did she just say "sky island"?

457
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,377
She's crazy.

458
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,554
[NAMI] Like I was saying, if you
know how to get to sky island...

459
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:05,352
[laughter]

460
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,479
Did she say
what I think she said?

461
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,316
Sky island? What an idiot!

462
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,192
What the...

463
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,861
You can look at the
Log Pose yourself!

464
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,864
It's pointed at the sky,
plain as day!

465
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,993
[CUSTOMER I]
Hey, check it out!

466
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,829
Do I look like the Log Pose now?

467
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,331
[CUSTOMER J] No one trusts
those things anymore!

468
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,749
They break if you breathe wrong!

469
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,918
[laughs]

470
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,712
You got me there, kid.

471
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,921
I can't believe you
guys are putting hope

472
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:38,385
into such a ridiculous legend
like an island in the sky.

473
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,721
Especially considering
how little you know.

474
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,598
Like, of the thousands
of weird currents cutting

475
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
through the Grand Line,

476
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,394
one of the weirdest is
called the Knock‐Up Stream.

477
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,021
Looks to me like
this is the first

478
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,981
you've ever heard about it.

479
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,400
Any ship that gets caught
in the Knock‐Up Stream

480
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,027
is catapulted into the sky,

481
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,988
and later slams back
into the ocean.

482
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,532
Years ago, a bunch
of ignorant sailors saw

483
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,284
ships falling from the sky

484
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,953
and assumed there must be
an island up there somewhere.

485
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,957
In their minds, how else could
a ship get up that high? Ha!

486
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,917
Ridiculous!

487
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,543
Anything that seems supernatural

488
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,795
always has a
rational explanation.

489
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,673
Anything a man can dream
will eventually be explained,

490
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,051
and let me tell ya,
the truth will hurt.

491
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,594
What a shame.

492
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,261
Look.

493
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,721
I was gonna let you join my crew

494
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,640
if you'd passed the
test of the new era.

495
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:28,352
But it seems like
you're a lost cause.

496
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,730
Thing is, the time of
pirate's dreams are over!

497
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,442
The City of Gold, the Emerald
Ruins, and the great One Piece!

498
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,694
The fools who dream of
these fictional treasures

499
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,614
don't notice the real
treasures that surround them!

500
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,533
In this age of oceans, the very
men who are brave enough

501
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,827
and capable of
navigating currents end up

502
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,748
chasing these ridiculous
dreams and die in the process!

503
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,709
Whenever people speak of these
dead idiots they always say,

504
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,545
"He was happy because
he died living his dreams."

505
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,338
Ha!

506
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,383
No, he died because
he was a fool!

507
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,386
So when I see people
chasing dreams of One Piece,

508
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,972
I get disgusted!

509
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,348
[NAMI]
Luffy!

510
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,894
[BELLAMY] You're a weak pirate,
just like they were,

511
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,689
and as long as you're hacking
around, you'll make us,

512
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,566
the real pirates,
look like trash.

513
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,819
[CUSTOMER K chuckles]

514
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,821
Get out of here,
you scrawny punk!

515
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,364
You're killing our buzz!

516
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,408
Way to go, Bellamy!

517
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,367
Get lost, you wimp!

518
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,952
[CUSTOMER N]
Put him in a body bag, Bellamy!

519
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,412
Yeah!

520
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,371
[laughs]

521
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,914
Bellamy, give
these people what they want!

522
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,666
Tear into them!

523
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,500
[BELLAMY chuckles]

524
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,919
I'd be more than
happy to entertain.

525
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,005
Yeah.

526
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,131
Luffy! Zoro!

527
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,007
Forget about all that
pacifist crap I was talking

528
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,635
about earlier and
take this jerk out!

529
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,387
[LUFFY]
Zoro.

530
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,641
No matter what happens,
don't fight back.

531
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,771
[laughs]

532
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,700
<i>♪Now, I look up and see,</i>
<i>there's something out there,</i>

533
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,370
<i>beyond the endless</i>
<i>clear‐blue sky...</i>

534
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:13,957
<i>Possibilities,</i>
<i>of just what could be,</i>

535
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:21,048
<i>a "someday" I'll see if I try...</i>

536
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,689
<i>When I am alone</i>

537
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:43,570
<i>all of the memories go</i>
<i>racing through my mind...</i>

538
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,947
<i>The things that</i>
<i>I've said and done,</i>

539
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:50,786
<i>the ones I've lost,</i>
<i>the dreams I left behind...</i>

540
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:55,791
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I would defeat myself</i>

541
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,168
<i>until I recalled...</i>

542
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,923
<i>That there was a warm place</i>
<i>I could always go</i>

543
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:06,760
<i>if I happened to fall...</i>

544
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,474
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...♪</i>

545
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,941
[NAMI] Hey! Why are you letting
them beat you like that?

546
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,442
[USOPP]
Men can make dumb decisions

547
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,944
inside their masculine heads.

548
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,946
[NAMI] And I suppose somehow,
they believe that dying

549
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,115
is going to prove them right
and vindicate them!

550
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,366
We can always leave them behind.

551
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,119
[USOPP] I think I'd still rather
have Luffy as Captain over you.

552
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,953
Sorry.

553
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:33,703
[NAMI]
Jerk.

554
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

555
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,415
"Distinguished Pirates!

556
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:40,043
A Man Who Talks of Dreams and
The King of Undersea Search!"

557
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,462
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!
