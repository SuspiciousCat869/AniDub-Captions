1
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,957
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,694
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,064
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,866
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,536
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,174
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,044
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,679
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,280
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:03,550
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,087
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:10,357
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,527
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:18,131
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,704
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,740
Luffy is headed
to Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,077
to rescue his brother,
Ace, from execution.

19
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,045
Also determined
to keep Ace alive

20
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,014
is the notorious
pirate Whitebeard,

21
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,651
who launches a surprise
attack with his massive crew.

22
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,758
[MARINE C]
Did he crack the air?

23
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:51,699
[MARINES yelling]

24
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,033
A seaquake!

25
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,735
He's turning the ocean
waters against us!

26
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,010
[ACE]
I... I won't lose.

27
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,846
[chuckles]

28
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,881
Ya got some fight left?

29
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,287
Look, I'm not gonna kill
you today, all right?

30
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,421
Don't fight it.

31
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,523
You're too valuable to die
in a place like this.

32
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,793
Run wild with us and
our flag will be yours.

33
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,100
And I will call you my son.

34
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,603
[ACE]
Screw you, you old fart!

35
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,007
[ACE]
Tell me.

36
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,677
Why does everyone on
this ship call him "Pops"?

37
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,281
You don't get it?
Because he calls us "sons."

38
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,916
None of us have any family left,

39
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,254
hell, the whole world hates
us, so it's nice, right?

40
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,223
I know it's just a word.

41
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,391
But it still feels nice.

42
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,799
[LUFFY] "The Force That
Could Destroy the World!

43
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,635
The Power of the
Tremor-Tremor Fruit!"

44
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,177
That's a lie! You
know the damn truth!

45
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,513
You told me not to go after
him, but I wouldn't listen--

46
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,449
[WHITEBEARD] I'm your Captain
and I told you to go.

47
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,092
[WHITEBEARD] Ace was
only following my orders.

48
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,194
Isn't that right, Marco?

49
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,530
Yep. I heard it myself.
Then you left.

50
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,300
Sorry for all the
trouble. Really.

51
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,868
Teach broke the
rules of our ship

52
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:10,037
and you had to seek justice.

53
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,538
Everyone in the world
knows what happens

54
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,840
if you mess with one
of our crewmates.

55
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,877
If you do, you're
gonna pay the price.

56
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,848
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE A] That means
if anyone lays a finger on you,

57
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,018
Ace, they're gonna
have to deal with us!

58
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,252
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE BB]
Don't worry, Ace!

59
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,420
We'll get you outta here!

60
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:32,292
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yelling]

61
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,294
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE AA] Get ready
to make hell your new home,

62
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,962
Navy bastards!

63
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,538
Have to admit,
we asked for this.

64
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:47,541
That had better not
be regret I hear.

65
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,178
This is a real mess.

66
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,014
[MORIA cackling]

67
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,349
All right, what do you
say we tally up the odds?

68
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,951
On this side, we've
got us Warlords,

69
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,354
the Navy's most ferocious
weapons, the Admirals,

70
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,355
and a 100 thousand soldiers!

71
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,691
On that side they've got
the Whitebeard Pirates,

72
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,094
an entire fleet of more
than 40 allied ships.

73
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:12,365
Okay, it's your move,
Whitebeard, let's go!

74
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,600
[chuckles]

75
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,802
Oh, I like it.

76
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:22,109
Looks like you are gonna
watch from the sideline.

77
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,045
I know, you're just
here to kill some time.

78
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,948
[DOFLAMINGO]
More for me, then.

79
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,117
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

80
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,053
[HANCOCK] This is oppressive.
I can hardly stand it.

81
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,224
These men are all the same.
Disgusting, bloodthirsty beasts.

82
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,027
In all my travels, I've
only met one exception.

83
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,296
Please stay safe, Luffy, for me.

84
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:53,874
[MARINE A]
Huh?

85
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,344
The.... water.

86
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:58,545
What's wrong?

87
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,853
It's receding.

88
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,854
What's causing it?

89
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,524
[PRISONERS yelling]

90
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,126
[PRISONER AA]
What the hell is going on?

91
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,194
[PRISONER BB]
What's happening?

92
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,063
Why is the ship
moving backwards?

93
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,004
Aw, c'mon, we had
this! What gives?

94
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,741
It was nothin' but smooth
sailing two minutes ago!

95
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,242
I'm as confused as you.

96
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,543
[MR. 3 screams]

97
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,978
[BUGGY] Careful! You've got
some of my favorite parts there!

98
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:37,351
[PRISONERS yelling]

99
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,253
Stupid ocean, we don't
have time to go backward!

100
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,988
What's making this happen?

101
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:45,091
[JIMBEI]
He's here.

102
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,443
[BUGGY yelps]

103
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,014
What? And now it's over?

104
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,350
I'm not complaining, but weird.

105
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,786
It pushed us...
a good distance back.

106
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,089
Well, great

107
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,625
At this rate, by the time we
get there, the fight'll be over.

108
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,930
[PRISONERS groaning]

109
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,331
[ALL]
Uh?

110
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,601
What was that?

111
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,503
[LUFFY]
Jimbei, c'mon!

112
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:32,106
Can we go faster?
We're already late!

113
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,974
We can't let them kill Ace!

114
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,879
Ace will be safe, for
now. We'll get there.

115
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,347
Okay.

116
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,782
[BUGGY]
Gimme a break!

117
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,816
[LUFFY]
Uh.

118
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:47,387
What? You know
something that we don't?

119
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,424
Is your fishman karate
gonna get us there on time?

120
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,725
Or better yet,

121
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,628
are ya gonna get your pals the
whale sharks to give us a ride?

122
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,964
[JIMBEI] My powers don't
have much to offer here.

123
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,366
[BUGGY] Yeah? Then where's
that confidence coming from?

124
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,336
He says we'll make it, 'kay?
So we're gonna make it!

125
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,870
"He says we'll make it"!

126
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,409
It's that simple, huh? Tch.
Fine! You keep believing.

127
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,911
I'm taking a nap.

128
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:11,611
Heh.

129
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,446
Wake me when we get there.

130
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,917
[PRISONER A]
Uh, Captain Buggy?

131
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:20,287
I really don't see this workin'
out if we don't move any faster.

132
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,423
You're not givin' up
on your dream, are you?

133
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,459
To become the King?
It's destiny, right?

134
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,528
[BUGGY]
Oh, uh, yeah.

135
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,196
Well, when the timing's right,

136
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,699
I'm sure some kind of
miracle will happen.

137
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,433
But this obviously
ain't the right time,

138
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,769
so all I can really do is wait.

139
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,905
[PRISONER A]
So, you are giving up?

140
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,506
How can you let
us down like that?

141
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,575
What's wrong with you?
Can't you see?

142
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,409
[PRISONER B, PRISONER C]
Uh?

143
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,411
[PRISONER A]
Just look at 'im!

144
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,946
That's not surrender,
it's not laziness,

145
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,181
that's confidence.

146
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,351
No. It's not. Not at all.

147
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,187
See? Cool as can be.

148
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,021
He's perfectly composed!

149
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,125
So regal, he's like
a king already.

150
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,127
How could I be so
blind? You're right.

151
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,029
[PRISONER A]
He's amazing!

152
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,598
So wrong. All of it.

153
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,569
[BUGGY]
I know miracles ain't exactly

154
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,738
the most common of occurrences,

155
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,108
but what the hell else can
I do except wait for one?

156
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,375
Dammit.

00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,018

158
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,152

Hm?

[PRISONER C]
The tide is changing course.

00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,032
We're moving forward again!

161
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,733
Did you do something?

162
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:43,103
Not me. All I've been doing
is keeping us on course.

163
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,875
[PRISONER CC] It feels like
it's starting to pick up speed!

164
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,510
It-It's happening! He's right!

165
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:51,445
[BUGGY]
Ah! Ow!

166
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,547
What is it? What's going on?

[PRISONERS]
Hey, Captain Buggy!

168
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,184
It's happening,
just like you said.

169
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,853
Look, the miracle
you prophesied.

170
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,754
[BUGGY]
Heh?

171
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,057
[MR. 3]
Hmm.

172
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,225
It's just a coincidence.

173
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:10,797
I don't know what's going on,
but it's our chance! Go!

174
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,533
[BUGGY]
What did I tell you, guys?!

175
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,768
All ya gotta do is wait
for the right time,

176
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,105
and now that time is callin'
me to become the King!

177
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,439
[BUGGY laughing]

178
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,909
[PRISONER A] You're incredible,
Captain Buggy! One of a kind!

179
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,379
[PRISONERS]
Yeah! Captain Buggy!

180
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,949
Yeah! At this rate,
we'll make it for sure!

181
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:33,854
[PRISONER F]
Uh?

182
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,388
Hey! Behind us!

183
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,990
[PRISONER E, PRISONER G]
Uh? Ah!

184
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:42,863
[BUGGY]
Heh? Gah!

185
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,564
Oh, hell no!

186
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,233
I don't get it.
Nobody is moving.

187
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,503
Maybe they're just waiting
for Whitebeard's command.

188
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,371
I'm choking on the tension.

189
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,713
What the--? It reversed.
The tide is rising again.

190
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:33,780
[MARINE B]
Uh?

191
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,317
[MARINE B]
Look! The horizon!

192
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,895
What the--? That's not right.

193
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,863
And here comes the final payoff.

194
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,933
That harmless seaquake he
threatened us with earlier

195
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,936
was just the prelude
to a massive tsunami!

196
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,411
"Quake Man" is
what they call him!

197
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:07,547
He wields the power of
the Tremor-Tremor Fruit!

198
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,185
[MARINES yelling]

199
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,089
[MARINE BB]
A tsunami! Run for it!

200
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,224
Our forces may be many,

201
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,459
but that won't
guarantee our victory.

202
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,362
Not against Whitebeard at least.

203
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:26,233
Before him, his crew,
no one is safe!

204
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:29,769
He has the power to destroy
the world in his veins!

205
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:42,249
It's happening! The great war.

206
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,920
[ALL]
Let's go!

207
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:51,157
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES]
Yeah!

208
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,564
[NARRATOR]
The invaders:

209
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:01,902
47 pirate ships from the New
World led by Whitebeard.

210
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,170
The defenders:

211
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,506
The two greatest forces
of the government,

212
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,110
Navy HQ and the Seven Warlords.

213
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:12,512
No matter who wins,
no matter who loses,

214
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,415
the world will be
forever changed.

215
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,191
[MARINE CC]
It's a tsunami!

216
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,997
[BOTH screaming]

217
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,667
[MARINES gasping]

218
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,336
[BOTH whimpering]

219
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,476
Now that is power! Heh!
He's straight outta hell!

220
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,343
[DOFLAMINGO chuckling]

221
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:21,014
[laughing]

222
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,905
[AOKIJI]
Ice Age.

223
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:49,009
[WHITEBEARD]
Aokiji.

224
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,378
You little squirt.

225
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,246
[FULLBODY]
He-He froze it!

226
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,651
That was too close!

227
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,419
Kuzan saved our butts!

228
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,222
[AOKIJI]
Partisan!

229
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,429
[AOKIJI]
Uh-oh.

230
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,161
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE CC]
The whole bay is iced over.

231
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,697
The ship's locked in.
We can't even move.

232
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,868
Hey. C'mon, guys. We've
got the admirals on our side.

233
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:50,304
They're the Navy's
greatest warriors, right?

234
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:51,805
Yeah, you're right.

235
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,675
There's nothin' to be
scared of. Screw Whitebeard.

236
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,143
[MARINES]
Yeah!

237
00:17:56,176 --> 00:18:00,513
All cannons, open fire!
Sink the Moby Dick!

238
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,329
Well, let's move.

239
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,265
We got something
to stand on now.

240
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,935
Let's show them what
we can do, gentlemen!

241
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:26,940
[WHITEBEARD PIRATES yelling]

242
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,978
We've got the Commanders
backin' us up, too!

243
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,747
Open fire and give 'em
everything ya got!

244
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,322
[SMOKER]
Mount a counter-offensive.

245
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,356
[TASHIGI]
Right!

246
00:18:58,673 --> 00:18:59,906
If I'm not mistaken,

247
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,844
that's the Fifth Division
Commander, Flower Sword Vista.

248
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,679
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE E yelling]

249
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,152
Keep on your toes, Tashigi.

250
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:13,720
The Commanders
aren't the only ones

251
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,188
we've gotta worry about here.

252
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,891
Every single one of these
S.O.B.s is a mighty soldier

253
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,392
in his own right.

254
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:22,762
Yes. Yes, thank you, sir.

255
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,766
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE F laughing]

256
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,201
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE F] This ice
in the water ain't half bad!

257
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,805
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE F]
Nice of him to set up

258
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,007
some stationary targets for us!

259
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,376
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE G]
Let's finish these ships off

260
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,544
so we can invade the island!

261
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,886
Yeah, I'm not sure
it's gonna be that easy.

262
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,931
[WHITEBEARD PIRATE DD] They're
sending out the Vice Admirals

263
00:19:56,964 --> 00:19:58,632
of Navy HQ.

264
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:03,070
It's a rare sight to see them
all lined up in a row like that.

265
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,304
Ain't that cute?

266
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,006
[ZODIA laughing]

267
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,709
It's like they rolled out
a Buster Call to greet us.

268
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,843
Too bad.

269
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,979
Because this time we're
the ones doin' the bustin'

270
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:14,081
as they're all
about to find out.

271
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:17,017
Hey, Tsuru, why don't
you stand back some?

272
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:20,087
Yeah, please. Just leave
this nonsense up to us.

273
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,223
Have a nice cup
of tea. Stay safe.

274
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:27,394
Don't give me that, ya
condescending pricks. I'm fine.

275
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,596
Besides, there's
no place safe now,

276
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,566
even if I swam all the way
to the end of the sea.

277
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,905
[SQUARD] We're settin' anchor
here on the ice, boys!

278
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:40,374
It's time to trounce
those Navy sissies!

279
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,576
Now push for solid ground! Go!

280
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,977
[SQUARD PIRATES]
Yeah!

281
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,214
We're happy to give our lives
for Pops. It'd be an honor.

282
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,017
Bring it on, Navy. My men
got nothing to fear!

283
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,886
Enough talk. Let's go,
Squard Pirates!

284
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,421
[SQUARD PIRATES]
Yeah!

285
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,893
And now, it all begins.

286
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,807
[DOFLAMINGO]
Huh?

287
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,143
Oh, man. Look!

288
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,311
Is Dracule Mihawk
gonna make a move?

289
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,681
Well, what do you know.
That is mighty strange.

290
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,151
So, piqued his
interest, did they?

291
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:27,187
Hawkeye finally
willing to fight.

292
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,290
[DOFLAMINGO] You gonna grace
them with your sword for once?

293
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:44,137
[HANCOCK] That icy gaze would
leave even a seasoned warrior

294
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,140
frozen dead in his tracks.

295
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,675
Even with his blade
resting upon his back,

296
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:51,344
who has the courage
to stare him down?

297
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,679
[VISTA]
Hawkeye.

298
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:56,316
Every swordsman worth their salt
longs to cross blades with him.

299
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,086
How else are we to find
our worth, but to duel?

300
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,024
Climbing the steps of glory
with death nipping at our heels.

301
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,862
Hey, that's the black
sword. Quite famous.

302
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:13,333
To be precise,
it's named Night.

303
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,536
There are only twelve
like it in the world.

304
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,671
They bear the highest grade.

305
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,473
See the dark edge of the blade?

306
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,476
The temper line?
Its clove pattern?

307
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,680
An ornate design suitable for
only the greatest swordsman.

308
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,123
It's Hawkeye.

309
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,061
[NARRATOR]
Mihawke and Kizaru

310
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,030
launch an attack
against Whitebeard.

311
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,533
Unfazed, his Commanders
leap into the fray,

312
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,968
showing off their fearsome
Devil Fruit powers.

313
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:23,671
As the struggle rages on,

314
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:26,240
Admiral Akainu unleashes
a living hell

315
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:28,909
that transforms the battlefield.

316
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:30,510
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

317
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,548
"An All-Consuming Inferno!!
Admiral Akainu's Power!"

318
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,384
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
