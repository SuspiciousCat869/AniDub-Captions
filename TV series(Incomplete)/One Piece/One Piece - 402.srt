1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,366
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,935
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:44,472
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:46,908
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,277
Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body

42
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,713
turned to rubber after
eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,549
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,552
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:58,887
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,256
of the World Government,
which will use

47
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,758
any means necessary
to stop them.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,529
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,765
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,968
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:18,706
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,777
[NARRATOR]
The Straw Hat crew landed

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,779
on the Sabaody Archipelago

54
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:27,682
seeking a coating mechanic to
help them reach Fishman Island.

55
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:29,817
But the man they met,
Silvers Rayleigh,

56
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:33,655
was also the former Vice-Captain
of the Roger Pirates.

57
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,758
Luffy and his crew
went into town to hide

58
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,793
while Rayleigh coated the Sunny.

59
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:41,563
Meanwhile, Admiral Kizaru,
an operative dispatched

60
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,631
from Navy Headquarters,
had already arrived

61
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,800
at the archipelago in
search of those responsible

62
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,403
for threatening the
Celestial Dragons.

63
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,539
[KIZARU]
Hello?

64
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,309
This is Admiral Kizaru.

65
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:56,844
Hm. That's odd.

66
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,549
Hello?

67
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,650
Now. Take this!

68
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:03,985
No, wait! Stop!

69
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:08,656
[KIZARU]
Hello?

70
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,831
[NARRATOR]
Fierce battles between the Navy

71
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:20,301
and the rookie pirates
erupted all over Sabaody.

72
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,371
Whoa, it grew!

73
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:26,341
[MARINES scream]

74
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:27,842
What the hell just happened?

75
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,545
He didn't even have
to lift a finger!

76
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:34,015
[KIZARU] Well, if I can't
find him, that leaves me

77
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:36,684
with a bit of
spare time, you see.

78
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:39,887
And if I have some spare
time, I obviously can't

79
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:42,457
let a wanted man escape.

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,828
Especially one with a
249 million berry bounty,

81
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,797
"Magician" Basil Hawkins.

82
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,433
Speed is weight. Observe.

83
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:57,038
This is what it feels like to be
kicked at the speed of light.

84
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:04,445
[HAWKINS PIRATES gasp]
Captain!

85
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,713
Huh?

86
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,383
What was that?

87
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,617
[HAWKINS]
Impressive.

88
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:12,487
You far surpassed
what I imagined.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,390
[NARRATOR] And then, yet
another "Bartholomew Kuma"

90
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:17,592
appeared before Luffy
and the others.

91
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:21,162
[USOPP]
Get back, Luffy!

92
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,598
[NAMI] He's one of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea!

93
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:27,468
He is? How do you
guys know that?

94
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:31,072
Luffy! Don't let that attack
hit you! It's a shockwave!

95
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,540
[LUFFY gasps]

96
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,710
Damn!

97
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,745
[NAMI] What is this?
[USOPP] Great!

98
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,515
So he can do this crap too?

99
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,651
Hey! You lied! That
wasn't a shockwave!

100
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:46,387
[LUFFY]
All right. Second Gear!

101
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,523
We know he's
strong, no question.

102
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,059
So let's go all-out
from the very start!

103
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,727
[ZORO]
Something's off here.

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,530
He seems different from
the last time we met.

105
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,372
[SENTOMARU]
It's chaos already.

106
00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:08,776
[SENTOMARU]
He'd better hurry.

107
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,846
[LUFFY yelling]

108
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,583
Or there won't be
any rookies left.

109
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:18,453
Well, certainly not
at this rate, I'd think.

110
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:23,024
[LUFFY]
Overwhelming!

[FRANKY]
Damn, this guy is unreal.

117
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,506
[USOPP] He can shoot those beams
from his hand and his mouth!

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,740

119
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,543

Here it comes again! Crap!

00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:20,214

Son of a-- the hell is he
shooting us with anyway?

124
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,863
[USOPP]
They're beams, obviously!

125
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:38,566
[FRANKY] That would be pretty
kickass if it were true,

126
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,201
but that tech
doesn't even exist!

127
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,636
It's just fantasy!

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,806
Wait. What are you
doing over there?

00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,774
[BROOK]
I'm playing dead. See?

130
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,510
[FRANKY, USOPP] He already
knows that's not true!

Yes! Way to go!

145
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:58,646
They took him down!

146
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,581
Those three are
just too awesome!

147
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:02,617
Don't forget, he's
one of the Warlords.

148
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,785
It'll take a lot more
than that to beat him.

149
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:10,224
And judging by their faces,
they know that, too.

150
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,959
So he's different now?

151
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:15,596
Well, then maybe he's
a twin or something.

152
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,767
It's possible, but
that's a scary thought.

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,236
They look the same,
but they're different.

154
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,773
The real one would have
teleported to dodge our attacks.

155
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,875
[ZORO] And he doesn't use
that shockwave attack.

156
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,810
He doesn't have
those paws, either.

157
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,280
[SANJI]
Well, he's plenty strong as-is.

158
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:33,881
And what's worse...

159
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:37,868
The real one might
be after us as well.

160
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,886
Well done. You gave
me quite a beating.

161
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,790
Heh. But I'm not just bigger
now, I'm much stronger, too!

one, didn'tcha?

The Mad Monk Urouge
may have escaped death

countless times before reaching
this place, but no matter

168
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,692
how strong he grows,
he cannot escape his fate.

00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,931
had advanced so quickly.

178
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,271
[DRAKE]

179
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,873
It's one hell of a show.
You've gotta admit that.

180
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:25,943
Indeed. But a Warlord
and an Admiral, friend?

181
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,945
Not even three pirates
with bounties over

182
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,046
100 million can handle that!

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,915
[UROUGE groans]

184
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:39,457
Is that Rear Admiral Drake?
Sorry, former Rear Admiral.

185
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,126
Not here for your old
job back, I take it.

186
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,431
[KIZARU] Or perhaps you'd
like to test the Pacifista?

187
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,234
I'm afraid your inside
knowledge will only

188
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,937
make your despair
all the greater.

189
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,341
Also, I suggest
you little chickies

190
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,277
exercise a level of caution.

191
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,751
After all, you have me
to contend with too.

192
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:08,252
[ALL grunt]

193
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:30,241
Hot damn, this fight just
delivers one crazy thing

194
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:34,145
after another! It's a
rare ancient Zoan type!

195
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,946
I've never seen one before!

196
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:43,387
[DINOSAUR roars]

197
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:53,097
[DINOSAUR roaring]

198

[DRAKE groans]

199
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,875
[DRAKE chuckles]

200
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,243
[DRAKE]
Imagine that.

201
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:10,014
You bleed red blood
just like the rest of us.

202
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,116
I'm surprised.

203
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:16,187
[UROUGE] A truly rare
sight! I'm speechless.

204
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,454
[KIZARU]
As I was just saying:

205
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:19,089
you have to contend
with me, too.

206
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:20,925
[UROUGE grunts]

207
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:47,017
Now ain't that something. You
Supernovas are a strange bunch.

208
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:51,255
Every one of you turns
into some scary monster.

209
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,891
Demon Face!

210
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,030
[HAWKINS]
He's gone!

211
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,365
[HAWKINS gasps]

212
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:07,137
[HAWKINS groans]
My eyes!

213
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:09,440
Captain Hawkins, run!
Get out of there!

214
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,177
[HAWKINS]
I... I can't see!

215
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,413
[HAWKINS grunting]

216
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,182
[KIZARU] I don't know
what your power is,

217
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:21,051
but I do know you
have a physical form.

218
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:23,153
It doesn't seem like
you're a Logia type.

219
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:25,256
[HAWKINS grunting]

220
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,929
Captain Hawkins!

221
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:34,198
He doesn't have any more
voodoo dolls to protect him!

222
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,066
He can't take any more of this!

223
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,402
[KIZARU] Looks like
you're the first to go.

224
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,037
[HAWKINS grunts]

225
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,940
[KIZARU] You did well to journey
all this way and for that,

226
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,275
you have my compliments.

227
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:50,047
[cymbols crashing]

228
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,916
Huh?

[jazz music playing]

231
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,940
[APOO]
Yo, people!

232
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,753
Who might this be?
And what is he doing?

233
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:41,610
[cymbols crashing]

234
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,546
Huh?

235
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:53,622
[jazz music playing]

236
00:15:53,622 --> 00:16:05,534

[APOO]
Yo, people!

238
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:10,739
[APOO]
Yo!, Yo-yo-yo! Yeah!

239
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:14,610
Yo! Is this music reaching you?

240
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:19,482
If you can hear it, stay tuned!
Navy Admiral Kizaru!

241
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:27,189
[APOO]
Yeah. Yo-yo-yo.

242
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:31,227
So he's the one.
He's the "Sea Roar".

243
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,662
[APOO]
Fighting music, kickin' it live!

244
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:36,532
C'mon. Scratch!

245
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:44,573
[KIZARU]
Huh?

246
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,444
What is this all about?

247
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,179
[APOO]
Here we go!

248
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,218
[KIZARU]
Huh...

249
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,792
Check it out!

250
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:05,561
[BOTH grunt]

251
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:16,772
[APOO laughs]
Gotcha!

252
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,175
Though, knowing you
Navy Admirals, you'll probably

253
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,343
be right back up in a second.

254
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,778
Glad I hung
around for a bit--

255
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,213
this was a sight to see.

256
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,582
I guess it's time for me
to scram. Peace out!

257
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:37,026
Hoo! How terrible.

258
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:11,260
[KIZARU sighs]
That one was quite the shock!

259
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:17,700
[APOO]
Po-po-po-po-pow!

260
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,202
[KIZARU]
I'll use the Yata Mirror.

261
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,843

[KIZARU] Hello?

[KIZARU]
Ah, here it is.

276
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:15,617
This is Borsalino.

277
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:17,486
[SENTOMARU]
What the heck, Uncle?

278
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,722
You do have a baby
transponder snail!

279
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,357
Why didn't you contact me?

280
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,760
[KIZARU]
Huh? Oh! Is that you, Sentomaru?

281
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,262
[SENTOMARU] Don't give me that
"Is that you?" business!

282
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,498
Where are you?
What are you doing?

283
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,433
I tried contacting you before,

284
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,502
but I couldn't get
a hold of you.

285
00:20:33,535 --> 00:20:35,237
Don't tell me you
were trying to talk

286
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,606
into the black
transponder snail again.

287
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:38,674
Huh?

288
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:40,642
[SENTOMARU] I've told you
before: the black one

289
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:43,278
on your wrist is for
eavesdropping! Remember?

290
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:45,614
[KIZARU]
Oh, that's right.

291
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:47,983
[SENTOMARU]
Ugh. It's fine, forget it.

292
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,618
It's time to get to work now.

293
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,920
It seems the culprits
have split up.

294
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:56,024
Straw Hat Luffy, Captain
Eustass Kid, and Trafalgar Law.

295
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:57,426
Which one do we start with?

296
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:01,864
Huh. Split up.
In that case, well...

doing? Snap out of it!

Hey, Zoro! What's the
matter with you?

310
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:22,544
How are you already hurt
so bad? We just started!

311
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:26,682
Look, just forget about
him for now, Luffy.

312
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,418
We're all screwed if we
can't beat this thing.

313
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,886
Yeah, right.

00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:38,727
[ZORO grunting, coughing]

315
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:42,631
[SANJI] He hasn't had the chance
to recover from last time.

316
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:46,001
Standing up to him at all must
be pretty damned painful.

317
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:50,506
That look on his face tells me
everything I need to know.

318
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,108
This bastard wants us
dead, but if he's not

Bartholomew Kuma,
who the hell is he?

320
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:57,846
Either way, we don't
have time for this crap.

321
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,115
If we don't get out of here,
we're gonna be even

322
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,717
worse off than we are now.

Ha!

00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:24,907
A secret I shall take to the
grave with me, if I must!

330
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,076
But if you really must
know, you may call me...

331
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,811
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece.
