WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.138
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.108
attained every treasure that
the world had to offer.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.844
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.146
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.353
Now you just have to find it!

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.456
[NARRATOR] Now, those who dare
to dream hoist their flags

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.393
and sail into
the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.992
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.895
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:47.133
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.302
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.670
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.939
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.841
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:57.243
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.946
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.617
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.186
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.889
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:14.027
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:18.198
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.934
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.370
which is located ten thousand
meters below sea level.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:27.874
There, they found themselves
facing the New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:30.543
who were looking to
destroy the Ryugu Kingdom,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.446
and instigated an all out war.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.481
After a long and
grueling battle,

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.584
Luffy finally defeated Hordy,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.852
the captain of the
New Fishman Pirates,

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.289
thwarting their
plan for revenge.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.092
[ROBIN]
Two years ago, up in Shandora,

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:50.430
I read a Poneglyph that located
one of the ancient weapons.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:54.667
This mermaid princess who lived
during the same time as Joy Boy,

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.204
she was known by another
name as well, wasn't she?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:03.009
She is the ancient
weapon, Poseidon!

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.947
[LUFFY]
"The Straw Hats Stunned!

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.817
The New Fleet
Admiral of the Navy!"

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.793
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm...

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:29.936
[NEPTUNE] Many years ago,
for some unknown purpose,

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.838
there were three
powerful entities

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.974
that could destroy
this entire world.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.212
[NEPTUNE] They were ancient
weapons named after gods--

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:45.184
Pluton, Uranus, and Poseidon.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:49.122
And one of those great
weapons is the princess.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.890
[NEPTUNE]
Indeed.

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:53.893
Well, if that's the case,

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.963
we can't let anyone
else know about this.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.632
If we did, the Government
and every other organization

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.801
would want Shirahoshi
for themselves.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.703
Not to mention other pirates.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.408
[CARIBOU]
Ancient weapons?

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.544
Strong enough to
destroy the whole world?

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:18.151
[CARIBOU chuckles] And to think
I was just going to take off

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:19.919
after stealing all
their silly trinkets!

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:21.087
How foolish of me,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.891
I almost overlooked the most
valuable item they've got!

00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:28.261
That mermaid princess is
more precious than I imagined!

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:31.497
[CARIBOU chuckles]

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.601
[FISHMAN SOLDIERS chattering]

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.071
[LUFFY] Whew! I think I
could go for another plate!

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.540
Don't tell me you've scarfed
down that much food already!

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.674
Can you blame me?

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.277
It's all so good. I could
eat this stuff till I die!

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.379
Especially the candy!

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.117
[LUFFY] It's as good as meat!
I'll take a hundred more!

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.752
W-Well, actually,

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:55.555
I'm afraid we've just
about run out of the candy.

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.457
B-But I'd be happy to
bring you something else

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.325
to eat if you'd like me to.

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.029
Okay, sure!

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.867
Tell me something, Luffy.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.602
While you sit here
stuffing your face,

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.804
are you aware of all that's
been happening in the world?

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.707
Huh? What're you
gettin' at, Jimbei?

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.443
Ah, so you're
completely uninformed.

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:20.113
That's a problem, but
I can't say I'm shocked.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.514
I'm lost.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.416
[shouts]

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.451
[BOTH] We've brought
you more food, Luffy!

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.353
Come with me.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:29.856
Sure. Just gimme a second.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.923
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm gonna take this one to go!

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:34.994
[LUFFY chuckles]

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:45.438
[LUFFY]
Hey!

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.840
--[NAMI] Hm?
--You guys left the party, too?

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.976
[snoring]

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.212
I'm trying to sober up.
I drank too much.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.947
And I ate too much.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.216
Sanji flirted too much.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.018
This place is so magical.

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.721
There's so many babes,
I can't take it.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:02.889
[USOPP burps]

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:03.823
What?!

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.959
So Akainu and Aokiji
fought each other?

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.162
[JIMBEI]
It was a major event.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:12.498
Did Rayleigh never mention this
to you during your training?

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.168
[LUFFY]
Nope, this is news to me.

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.203
[JIMBEI]
That was cruel of him.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.038
Oh! I knew about
it the whole time!

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.072
So did I do good?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.874
That's crazy!

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.781
It all started two years ago,
right after the war ended.

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.584
Sengoku resigned
as Fleet Admiral.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.922
[JIMBEI] Aokiji was
well-liked among his own men,

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.826
so Sengoku nominated him
to take over the title.

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:43.095
But many high-ranking
officials favored Akainu,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.465
so he became a
contender as well.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:50.536
[JIMBEI] Aokiji is
normally cool-tempered,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.540
but he was quite adamant
in his disapproval of Akainu.

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.276
He found him unfit
for the position.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.979
So it did not take long
for the disagreement

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:02.281
to come to blows on
an island somewhere.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:06.018
It was the first and final
battle between the two admirals.

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.556
[JIMBEI]
It was agreed that whoever lost

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.227
would withdraw his
candidacy without protest.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.329
And the winner...

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:19.098
...would become the
leader of the Navy.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.401
As the rest of
the world now knows,

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.770
they fought for ten whole days.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:28.307
The two opponents were
equally matched in power,

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.210
but the duel finally ended.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:36.749
Akainu, or as some know him,
Sakazuki, emerged victorious.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.184
[LUFFY groans]

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:40.586
That bastard won?

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.923
I'm putting an end to this!

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.864
So did he kill Aokiji?

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.600
Well, both Admirals
were severely injured.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:58.070
In fact Aokiji couldn't
even stand after it was over.

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:01.207
However Akainu was
strangly merciful towards him.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.278
Despite this, Aokiji refused
to accept the result.

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:07.013
He has resigned from the Navy.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:10.049
I can't believe Aokiji would
just up and quit like that.

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:11.284
[JIMBEI]
Indeed.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:15.054
I wonder what's been going
through his mind since then.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.858
The Government has certainly
lost a valuable asset.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.028
You can say that again.

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.496
The Admirals were
the main reason

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:25.631
the Navy was so
powerful, weren't they?

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:29.068
At first, yes, but they have
found ways to overcompensate

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.270
in Aokiji's absence.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:34.173
One might argue that they're
more dangerous than ever now.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.749
There is still much
you do not know.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:45.017
Listen closely.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.954
Before you reach the New
World, you must be aware

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:50.623
of two key changes that
have occurred there.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:55.561
Now then, the first matter, as
I've already begun to explain,

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:58.264
is that the Navy under
Fleet Admiral Sakazuki

00:09:58.297 --> 00:10:00.066
is stronger than before.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.501
And secondly...

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:06.672
...the Blackbeard Pirates are
making strides of their own.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.174
Those guys again?

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.443
You mean the ones we
met back in Mock Town?

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:13.479
They attacked my homeland.
I could never forget them!

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.917
This new era they keep
rambling on and on about

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.086
is a load of crap.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:23.856
The era when pirates dream of
treasure will come to an end?

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.226
Right! [cackles]

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.101
The dreams of pirates...

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:37.637
...will never end!

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.039
[cackling]

00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.408
So you're...

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:43.976
...Blackbeard.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.044
Huh?

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:48.047
Oh, right, I guess I never
gave you my name, did I?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.416
[cackles]

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:54.487
Long time no see,
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.721
[JIMBEI]
He spent many years

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.658
as a member of the
Whitebeard Pirates.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.293
He was already familiar
with the territory.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:04.397
So after their captain died,
Blackbeard wasted no time

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.500
in seizing control
of it for himself...

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:09.035
...using the Tremor Tremor Fruit

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:11.337
he stole upon
Whitebeard's death.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:15.041
He's gaining quite
the reputation.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:20.479
Along with Shanks,
Kaido, and Big Mom,

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:23.449
he's joined the ranks
of the Four Emperors.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.887
So he stole Whitebeard's
Devil Fruit and his title?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.522
Talk about a scumbag!

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:33.025
I agree, his audacity
is infuriating.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:35.394
There's a rumor going around
that they're currently

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:38.330
on the hunt for those
with Devil Fruit powers.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.801
I am not sure how it's possible,
but it seems they've found a way

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:45.404
to acquire abilities from the
other people upon killing them.

00:11:45.438 --> 00:11:47.807
Clearly, they plan to
usurp the strongest powers

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.543
they can find and
become unstoppable.

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.078
Be on your guard.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.548
No, they're gonna take mine!

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:57.783
The Human Human Fruit?
I think you're safe.

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.952
You sure?

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.521
I worry for you the most, Luffy.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:07.460
I know there's a great deal of
bad blood between you and Teach.

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:09.128
You must take care--

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:17.069
Luffy!

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.804
Have you been listening to me?

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:19.705
Uh?

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.941
You're supposed to
be the captain here!

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:23.008
The captain needs to have

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.277
at least some idea
of the situation!

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.847
Whoa, it's okay, Jimbei.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.981
The rest of us heard you.

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:29.982
Huh?

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.984
I thought the captain
was supposed to goof off

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:33.385
while the crew
looks out for him!

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.154
Shame on you, Luffy!

00:12:35.187 --> 00:12:38.457
A good captain dedicates his
life to the safety of his crew,

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:39.325
and here you are--

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:40.659
Don't be such a drag!

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:42.795
I'd rather take my chances
and see what happens.

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:44.530
It's more fun that way!

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:47.967
[JIMBEI gasping]

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.370
[JIMBEI]
I don't envy you all one bit.

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:53.239
[STRAW HAT PIRATES]
Tell me about it.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.608
Are you here, Luffy-chin?

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.176
There you are!

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:00.646
The party's for you, ya know.
Why are all you guys hiding out?

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.848
[LUFFY]
Hey, Camie!

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:05.818
Oh, yeah, what happened
to Weepyhoshi? She leave?

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:06.852
She was tired.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.754
All the excitement made
her need a little nap,

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.656
so she went up to her room.

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.191
[LUFFY]
Hmm...

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:14.727
Uh.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.797
[LUFFY]
Mm...

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:20.499
Hang on.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.600
Zoro!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.769
Sanji!

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:28.407
It seems like... there's
some kinda monster here.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.176
You may be right.

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:32.144
[SANJI]
Yeah, I feel it, too.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:38.617
[sighs]

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:41.153
I never dreamed a party
could be such fun!

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:44.723
I might have to take a little
nap just to recover from it all!

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.212
Uh.

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.149
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.752
[yells]

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.857
[SHIRAHOSHI yells]

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.759
[CARIBOU cackles]

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:23.229
[SHIRAHOSHI screams]

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:29.235
[cackles]

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.420
[screams]

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.991
Help me!

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:54.159
[CARIBOU]
Shh!

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:55.060
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Who are you?

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:58.364
Please, I beg you, unhand me!

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:02.401
[cackles]

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:05.371
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Someone, please save me!

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:07.640
[CARIBOU cackles]

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:09.775
[CARIBOU] You've cut me
to the quick, princess!

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:13.212
Don't look so unhappy to see me!

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.446
Just relax.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.850
I promise I won't do anything
to cause you pain, my dear!

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:20.286
I was ready to settle
for just the treasure after

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:23.188
selling off the other mermaids
turned out to be a hassle,

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:25.758
but you might just
be an exception!

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.526
Now then, I want
you to be a good girl

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:28.994
and go to sleep
for a little while.

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.562
Can you do that for me?

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.531
I just received word
from my brother!

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.401
He and the crew have made
port on Fishman Island!

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:37.469
We're all headed
to the New World,

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.638
and we'd like for you
to come along with us!

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.340
Is that...?

00:15:41.373 --> 00:15:44.143
Now, now. Show me a smile!

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.646
[CARIBOU cackling]

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.347
Hey, you!

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.449
Oh, what do you want, Straw Hat?

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:53.185
Go find your own mermaid
princess. We're busy!

00:15:53.218 --> 00:15:55.988
[CARIBOU laughing]

00:15:56.989 --> 00:16:01.994
[CARIBOU laughing]

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.633
[yelps]

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.568
[CARIBOU]
It's you!

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:11.170
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy!

00:16:11.203 --> 00:16:14.573
[screams]

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.041
[thud]

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:19.645
[CARIBOU yelling]

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.347
That guy was still here?

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.649
[SHIRAHOSHI]
Luffy!

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.684
[SANJI gasps]

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.587
That was scary,
thank you for saving me!

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.556
[SANJI]
Luffy, you lucky bastard!

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.891
I shoulda kicked him
while I had the chance!

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:35.894
Wasn't that the pirate we
captured not too long ago?

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.696
I haven't seen him
since we left the island.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.832
Hell, I haven't even
thought about him.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.001
Oh, well, I guess he's gone now.

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:43.469
That was a close call.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.304
We really can't
thank you enough, Luffy.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.805
Eh, it's no big deal.

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.841
That ruffian who stole from us.

00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:51.110
I can't believe
he was still nearby!

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.845
This place is usually
locked up so tight

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.580
even a guppy can't get in.

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.582
But with everything
that's happened,

00:16:56.615 --> 00:16:58.217
it seems we left it open!

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.418
And look!

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:02.087
That big tower over there
has been sliced clean in two!

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:05.524
The robber must've done it
while we were out in the plaza!

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:06.925
[ZORO]
Hm...

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.595
Sorry, actually,
that would be this guy.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.163
Man, you shoulda seen him!

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:12.297
When they got out of the cage,

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.233
he was hacking and slashing
all over the pla--!

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:17.136
[ZORO] Jeez! Learn to keep your
mouth shut, stupid starfish!

00:17:17.169 --> 00:17:18.303
I don't think so!

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.073
If I don't say something,
that makes me an accomplice!

00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.209
Hey, Righty, here's a question!

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.477
R-Righty?

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.613
You mentioned a
treasure thief, right?

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:28.847
Yes, you heard correctly.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.582
That unsavory man
who was just here

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.551
snuck into the palace
and robbed us blind!

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:34.586
Really? Well, then.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.488
[ZORO, LUFFY gasp]
Here we go again.

00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.991
[NAMI] You're gonna let him
steal national treasures?

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:41.393
[NEPTUNE] Now that my
people are safe from harm,

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.762
I care nothing
for material riches.

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.130
[NAMI]
Oh, cut the crap.

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:46.198
[NAMI gasps]

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.300
Wait, so you're saying you
don't want them anymore?

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.903
[NEPTUNE] If you can rescue
them, you're free to keep them.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.205
It's the least I can
do for our heroes.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:56.708
Well, if you insist!

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.844
[NAMI] You idiots just had
to kick him into next week,

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.112
didn't you?

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:01.880
Why couldn't you just knock him
out and tie him up in the tower?

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:02.548
[ZORO, LUFFY yell]

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.916
Oh, Nami, you're so cute--

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:05.417
[thudding]

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.686
[NAMI]
Go catch him and bring him back!

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.622
[LUFFY, ZORO, SANJI yelling]

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.891
[NAMI panting]

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.460
[FISHMAN SOLDIER A]
Y-Your Majesty!

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.127
[NEPTUNE]
Hmm?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.862
It's Hordy and his men, sir!

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.230
Their handcuffs came off!

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.765
[NEPTUNE]
But how?

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.140
[HORDY]
Damn you, humans!

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:30.509
Don't think we've
forgotten our grudge!

00:18:30.542 --> 00:18:33.545
We'll exact our
revenge soon enough!

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:38.383
And Straw Hat'll
be the first to die!

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:40.586
Bring him to my cell!

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:45.624
[HORDY cackling]

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:49.928
[HORDY coughing]

00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:00.472
Oof, my back hurts.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:03.475
I sure could use a drink!

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:07.312
[ZEO coughs]
I aged myself on purpose.

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:09.148
I wanna get back
at the Straw Hats,

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.783
but my energy's at
an all-time lowsun.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:15.020
Kya, kya...

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:21.293
We won't show them
an ounce of mercy-hhi.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.961
What in the world
has happened here?

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:26.798
Don't tell me.
Is that Hordy and his crew?

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.535
You think these
bars can hold me?

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:31.837
What a bunch of morons!

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.874
I'll break them in.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.042
[HORDY grunts]

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:40.546
[HORDY yells]

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:42.614
Captain Hordy!

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.683
[BOTH yelling]

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.785
Why are they so brittle?

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:48.053
Just as I thought.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.721
That Energy Steroid
you were taking

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.390
to make yourselves stronger,

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.792
and the pill from
inside the Tamate Box--

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.761
they're one and
the same, aren't they?

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.196
Uh, Tamate Box?

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.697
[NEPTUNE]
A priceless artifact

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.567
passed down for
generations, jamon.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.035
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
The pills hidden inside

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:05.003
were highly valuable as well,

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.739
but ten years ago,
someone stole them from us.

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:10.509
We failed to catch the culprit.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:13.345
His Majesty was concerned
that a scandal might break out.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.247
So we closed the case.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.015
Actually, Hordy.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:20.052
I think that happened around
the same time you left the army.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:21.687
Interesting.

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:26.892
Ha. Of course it was me.

00:20:26.925 --> 00:20:29.161
Look what's happened to my body!

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.430
Need me to spell it out for you?

00:20:31.463 --> 00:20:33.565
[NEPTUNE] The pills
were treasured heirlooms,

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.401
the truth behind their
purpose lost long ago.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:38.971
Tales of their power and the
curse that accompanied them

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:41.673
were both passed down
merely as legend.

00:20:41.707 --> 00:20:44.810
But still enough
to make us wary.

00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:46.411
It would appear
that our discretion

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:47.913
was warranted, however.

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:50.148
The Tamate Box
was carefully guarded

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:52.150
for the safety of our people.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:56.021
This result is
truly regrettable.

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.789
If you had not
allowed your judgement

00:20:57.823 --> 00:21:00.392
to be clouded by
foolish dreams of power,

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:01.960
you would not have
subjected yourselves

00:21:01.994 --> 00:21:03.695
to this terrible fate.

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:08.000
What the hell do you know?

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.068
[HORDY coughs]

00:21:11.737 --> 00:21:15.274
[NEPTUNE] In any case, they'll
never get their vengeance now.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:18.243
You'll see!

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:20.612
The heavens have chosen
us to settle the score

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.681
and that's just what we'll do!

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:26.485
And we'll not only wipe
out the human race...

00:21:26.518 --> 00:21:30.722
...we'll annihilate you
and your entire family!

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.324
[NEPTUNE]
I pity them.

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:36.261
Perhaps I ought to
offer them clemency.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:38.297
[HORDY]
Wait, Neptune!

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:43.468
[HORDY] Fukaboshi, you're
a disgrace to our people!

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:51.109
Fishman Island is healing now.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:53.545
So, although you
killed my mother,

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.247
I will not hold a grudge.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.481
[HORDY gasps]

00:21:56.515 --> 00:22:02.054
The least that you can do,
is refrain from speaking.

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.991
I don't want the children
hearing your poisonous words.

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:15.867
[FISHMAN SOLDIER B]
Minister of the Left!

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:16.802
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Huh?

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.237
Baron Tamago and Mr. Pekoms.

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.606
They're at the sweets factory!

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.209
They're here to
collect for Big Mom.

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:26.645
We can't face them now!

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:27.446
[CROWD whimpers]

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:30.982
[PEKOMS]
Hand over the sweets! Grr!

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:38.190
[TAMAGO] Don't keep
Mama waiting. Tout de suite!

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:45.697
We don't have any sweets
for this month's payment.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.700
Hordy and his lackeys
tore the factory apart.

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:50.235
And all the candy
we could salvage

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:53.105
was sent to the banquet so
the Straw Hats could enjoy it!

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:54.473
What should we do?

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:01.213
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Something tells me Big Mom

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:06.051
of the Four Emperors won't
be satisfied with an apology.

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:10.288
That woman would level
an entire country for sweets!

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:15.527
[NARRATOR] While the
Straw Hats rush to retrieve

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.329
Fishman Island's
stolen treasure,

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:20.031
pirates working
for Big Mom appear.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.601
After scarcely avoiding
destruction at Hordy's hand,

00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:25.871
the island is now under threat
from an even stronger adversary.

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.507
Luffy steps up to save
the Fishmen once again,

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.642
but may doom himself
by antagonizing

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.744
one of the strongest
pirates in the New World.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.413
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:34.446 --> 00:23:38.150
"She Loves Sweets!
Big Mom of the Four Emperors!"

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.652
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
