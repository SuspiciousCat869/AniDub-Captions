1
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,466
A joyous new year has arrived
in the country of Grand Jipang.

2
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,434
Oh, what a blessing that is!

3
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,370
Now that the stressful
days of finishing things up

4
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,438
by the end of the
year are behind us,

5
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,541
why don't we just slow
down and take it easy?

6
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,577
After all, we have the
whole year ahead of us.

7
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,280
What the--?

8
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,149
I said "we should take it easy",

9
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,318
not "let's cause
trouble and chaos!"

10
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,186
Who's responsible for this?

11
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,522
Make way! Make way!

12
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,357
Comin' through, people!

13
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,526
To be honest,
I really don't think

14
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,195
all that shouting is
necessary, Onami-san.

15
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,497
What?

16
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,432
There isn't anybody around.

17
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,501
Yeah. You're right!

18
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,708
The sun's been up for hours,

19
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,610
but this place looks
like a ghost town.

20
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,780
Do you think everyone's
just sleeping in or something?

21
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,315
Oh come on, Sensei!

22
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,050
What are you talking about?

23
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,320
Everyone's up early and
already over at the castle!

24
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,522
After all, today is
one of Grand Jipang's

25
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:45,326
most popular events: The New
Year's Big Rice Cake Tossing!

26
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,262
If you live here, you drop
everything to be a part of it.

27
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,364
Wow. Is that so.

28
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,298
Yep!

29
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,067
And no Rice Cake Tossing
event is complete

30
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,735
without rice cakes, am I right?

31
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,070
That's where we come in!

32
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:56,937
So, hurry it up!

33
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,772
Our shop's reputation
is on the line!

34
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,073
You got it!

35
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,142
Hey, wait.

36
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,777
Don't they usually do
these rice cake tossings

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,479
at temples and shrines?

38
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,781
Around here, our lord
tosses them out at the castle.

39
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,617
Sometimes the scramble
for them is so rough,

40
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,051
people even get killed!

41
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,353
What?

42
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,121
He's kidding. Nobody dies.

43
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,188
It's not that crazy.

44
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,191
Well, when that Straw Hat
and food are involved,

45
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:20,126
you never know just
how crazy it's gonna get.

46
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,362
Aw, man.

47
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,265
Why do I feel like
someone's talking about me?

48
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,103
Yeah, I know what you
mean about Boss Straw Hat,

49
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,638
but I didn't think
everyone else in town

50
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,806
likes stuffing their
face the way he does.

51
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,742
It's not like that, Sensei.

52
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,645
Nobody really cares about
the regular rice cakes,

53
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,047
they want the "jackpot" one!

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,615
The "jackpot" one?

55
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,250
That's right!

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,519
While tens of thousands of
rice cakes will be tossed out

57
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:50,157
from the top of the castle,
only one holds the jackpot!

58
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,526
Inside this special rice cake,
there's a huge diamond

59
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,562
that's said to be worth more
than 10 million Ryo-Berries!

60
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,696
Amazing, right?

61
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,166
I'd sure like to get my
hands on something like that!

62
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,733
Just think.

63
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,268
You'd be set for years!

64
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,404
No doubt about it!
It would be incredible!

65
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,439
But how are you supposed
to tell the difference

66
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,776
between the regular rice cakes
and the "jackpot" rice cake?

67
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,011
Beats me. I've never
actually seen one!

68
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,247
Hey, buddy--do you know?

69
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,116
No. Not a clue.

70
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,185
I guess you just have to
grab as many as possible

71
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,088
and then break them open
to see if anything's inside.

72
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:21,989
Ah.

73
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,457
Sounds like trying
to win the lottery.

74
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,059
It's a wild goose chase.

75
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,794
If I find the
"jackpot" rice cake,

76
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,530
I'm gonna buy a
whole ton of books!

77
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:34,534
I think I'd like to go on
vacation with all my friends!

78
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,371
Hey!

79
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,140
Looks like you
opened up early, huh!

80
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,207
Yep.

81
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,644
I've got a seven-spring-herb
rice porridge today.

82
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,512
Since it's the
seventh. Want some?

83
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,313
Sure!

84
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,281
Sounds great!

85
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,482
No fair, Usopp!

86
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,717
How come you get to eat!

87
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,318
I wanna eat, too!

88
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,087
You can't, Boss!

89
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,755
You have to stay up
there and keep watch!

90
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:55,822
Besides, this is porridge!

91
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,458
If I throw it up to you,
it's going to make a mess,

92
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,661
so--What the heck
it going on here?

93
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,431
Oh! Special delivery! Thanks!

94
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,432
Fine! Whatever!

95
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,533
Just make sure once you're done,

96
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,036
you'll go back to the front
and stand watch, okay?

97
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,170
Lazy boss.

98
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,206
Here. You must be busy.

99
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,407
Yeah.

100
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,042
We gotta guard that 10 million

101
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,710
Ryo-Berry jackpot
rice cake, you know?

102
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,345
With something that
valuable up for grabs,

103
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,114
I wouldn't be surprised
if someone blinded

104
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,083
by greed was planning
to try and steal it.

105
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,091
Sitting around and
waiting for that jackpot

106
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,360
when you don't know where
it's gonna fall is a pain!

107
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,629
Playing by the rules
isn't my style at all!

108
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,300
So, after much consideration,
I thought of an alternative.

109
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,201
A better plan!

110
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,238
We'll just grab
all the rice cakes

111
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,373
before they ever
reach the castle!

112
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,676
That way, we'll get the
one containing the jackpot

113
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,643
without a doubt!

114
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,111
It's a glorious plan!

115
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,412
Indeed!

116
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,680
All right, men!

117
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,449
Let's steal those
rice cakes flashily!

118
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,687
We're stuck on this bridge!

119
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,155
There's nowhere to turn!

120
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,824
Damn! And we're so
close to the castle!

121
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,760
All right, you two!
There's no turning back now!

122
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,196
Sensei?

123
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,597
Let's do it!

124
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:18,772
That was close!

125
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,141
Not bad. Nice reflexes.

126
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,348
Onami. That's just cruel.

127
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:31,017
Take this!

128
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,187
Sensei! Behind you!

129
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,326
Mellorine! Mellorine!

130
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,265
Richie! Why, you!

131
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,601
Stop, you bastards!

132
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,602
Unless you wanna die,

133
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,004
you'll leave everything
on that cart with me!

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,321
Hey, Boss!

135
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,189
I think they got away!

136
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,591
We'll never catch 'em!

137
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,159
They'll reach the castle long

138
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,128
before we can get our
hands on that jackpot!

139
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,229
Don't be ridiculous!

140
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,498
That's 10 million Ryo-Berries
we're talking about!

141
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,565
I'm not giving up!

142
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,700
But, Boss.

143
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,436
They're not getting
away from me!

144
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,307
Now, it's time to set
Plan B into motion.

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,342
All right, morons!
Out of the water!

146
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,210
Get ready! Move it!

147
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,344
Yes, sir!

148
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:42,623
Father?

149
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,693
It seems the townspeople are
getting excited down there.

150
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,760
Yes.

151
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,628
I think they're even more
excited than last time.

152
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,232
Unfortunately,
our precious rice cakes

153
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,402
have yet to make
their appearance.

154
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,304
Indeed.

155
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,706
I have someone on
the lookout for them,

156
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,474
but I haven't received a report.

157
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,510
They should have
been here by now.

158
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,612
I'm starting to think something
may have happened to them.

159
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,815
I'm getting a bit worried.

160
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,383
Oh, that's right.

161
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,051
The people that
prepared the rice cakes

162
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,820
are friends of
yours, aren't they?

163
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,389
Maybe we should send someone
over to see what's going on.

164
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,158
They said they'd
rather get paid more

165
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,327
than accept our
help with security.

166
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,261
I did as they asked,

167
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,631
but now I'm not so
sure it was a good idea.

168
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,099
I hope Onami-san and
the others are okay.

169
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,103
Ah! There they are!

170
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,337
What took them so long?

171
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,206
Rice cakes taste better when
they're freshly made, you know.

172
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,577
A kite? That seems weird.

173
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,083
What's going on?

174
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,318
Why are we floating?

175
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,120
Hold on tight back there!

176
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,389
They were waiting
to ambush us again?

177
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,125
Let me guess!

178
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,761
You're another crony from
the Clown Family, aren't you?

179
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,631
Octolutely!
I mean uh absolutely!

180
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,566
By the order of Boss Buggy.

181
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,635
I am to apprehend
all of your rice cakes.

182
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,037
Hi, my name is Hachi.

183
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,704
It's very nice to meet you.

184
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,281
Don't worry.

185
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,249
As long as you hand
over those rice cakes

186
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,585
without any trouble,
no one will be harmed.

187
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,686
You have my word.

188
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,588
You'll return to
the ground safely.

189
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,722
You've gotta be kidding!

190
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:24,058
If we don't deliver these
rice cakes to the castle,

191
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,193
our reputation will
be completely ruined!

192
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,828
Come on!
Do something, Sanji-kun!

193
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,730
There's not really a lot
I can do in this situation.

194
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,667
Save me!

195
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:37,137
Hey, hey! Don't move
around so much!

196
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,773
It won't be my fault
if you all fall off!

197
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,477
All right, you thief!

198
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,680
Surrender peacefully and no
one gets hurt, understand?

199
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,152
Now Gum-Gum--Hey!

200
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,689
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

201
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,300
I wonder why I'm falling, too.

202
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,436
Oh, that's right!

203
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,404
I should have let go
of the kite string!

204
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,206
So careless!

205
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,147
There! Everything's all right.

206
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,681
No, it's not! Look behind you!

207
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,586
That bastard!

208
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,324
Well, would you look at that!

209
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,593
The rice cakes are
rolling right into my lap!

210
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:35,195
In a few moments that
jackpot will be mine!

211
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,301
Igaram-san!

212
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,804
Chaka, Pell! Quick!
Grab that cart!

213
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,138
Sir!

214
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,676
Damn you!
How dare you interfere!

215
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,110
I don't care who they are!

216
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,212
Take them down, now!

217
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,249
What the hell are
you morons doing?

218
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,250
Sorry, Boss!

219
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,286
But it's hard to carry
this much weight uphill.

220
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,589
You think maybe we
could take a break?

221
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:02,556
Stop your babbling!

222
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,424
After them! Go!

223
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:08,128
Onami-dono! Are you alright?

224
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,097
Yes. Despite a few setbacks,

225
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,732
your order was
delivered as promised.

226
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,834
I appreciate your hard work.

227
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,135
About our payment.

228
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,637
We get it right away, don't we?

229
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,106
We went through more trouble
than expected on this one.

230
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,575
Uh, yeah. About that.

231
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,577
Hey now.
This is castle business.

232
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,145
You can't put it on a tab.

233
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,314
Vivi-sama said she
would bring the payment

234
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,183
to your shop in person tomorrow.

235
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,551
Wait until then.

236
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,687
Now, if you'll
excuse me, please.

237
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,156
Sounds good!

238
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,391
Tell Vivi she can
stop by any time!

239
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,563
Come on! Won't those
idiots ever give up?

240
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,831
Don't worry about
them, Sanji-kun.

241
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,733
Let's just make our way
over to the event site.

242
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,668
We've handed them off.

243
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,070
Leave the rest to the
staff at the castle.

244
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,273
Hey, Boss! Listen up!

245
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,542
If anything goes wrong and
they can't toss the rice cakes,

246
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,411
you'll be banned from our shop.

247
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,512
So work hard out there, okay?

248
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,653
It's too late, Boss!

249
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,389
They've already made
it inside the castle!

250
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,524
Oh, shut up! It doesn't matter!

251
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,360
We'll force our way in!
And we'll do it flashily!

252
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,333
What? It's already started?

253
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm late for the tossing!

254
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,170
Intruders!

255
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,471
Don't let them get away!

256
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,575
It's the Clown Family!

257
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:29,376
They're after the rice cakes!

258
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,211
Understood! Please, hurry!

259
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,249
Hey! Which way
to the event site?

260
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:37,484
Oh! Hey, it's you!

261
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,819
You're here just in time!

262
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,187
Can you give us a hand?

263
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,121
Huh?

264
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,055
A group of guys showed up

265
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,557
and they're trying
to steal the rice cakes.

266
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,125
They're going on a rampage!

267
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,326
Bastards!

268
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,629
I've been looking forward
to those rice cakes for days!

269
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,663
Where are those thieves?

270
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,698
That way!

271
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:51,966
Thanks!

272
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,768
How dare they try to keep all of
those rice cakes for themselves!

273
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,736
It's disgraceful!
Those are mine, dammit!

274
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,439
"Yours", huh?

275
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,073
You're no better than they are.

276
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,443
Get back here, thieves!

277
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,344
There's no escape!

278
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,745
I'm gonna take you
down no matter what!

279
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,450
Where are the rice cakes?

280
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,558
We gotta stop them

281
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,593
before they destroy
any more of the castle!

282
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,096
I have a pretty good
idea where they're headed.

283
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,764
Come on, Monk!
I know a short cut!

284
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,333
We can cut them off if
we hurry, so let's go!

285
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,534
Oh! Hey there, Usopp!

286
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,669
Thought I heard you.

287
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,737
Who are you talking to?

288
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,605
Hey, Boss! Isn't it obvious?

289
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,808
I'm talking to--
What? Where'd he go?

290
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,509
When did this happen?

291
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,615
Either way, I'm going
on ahead, okay?

292
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,485
That monk is useless.

293
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,120
Completely unreliable.

294
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,688
Where did that idiot
run off to, anyway?

295
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,495
Where are the
rice cakes, thieves?

296
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,301
Wait! I didn't mean to--

297
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,805
Oh, no! Oh-no-oh-no-oh-no.

298
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,408
Amazon-dono! Are you alright?

299
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,276
Someone help us!

300
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,145
What is it? What the
hell's going on in here?

301
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,213
A deviant has broken in!

302
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,081
You pervert!

303
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,326
What the hell did I do?

304
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,694
Get away from me!

305
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,261
Get back here!

306
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,103
That should do it!
Now charge in! Move it!

307
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,040
Boss Buggy!

308
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,343
That's far enough, Clown Family!

309
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:45,679
I won't tolerate any more
violence in this castle!

310
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,681
Prepare yourselves!

311
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,619
Oh? My-my-my, what have we here?

312
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,787
The Princess has
come to welcome us.

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,488
How kind of you!

314
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,128
Not familiar with the power
of the Chop-Chop fruit?

315
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,130
This is what you
get for interfering.

316
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,571
But just so there's
no misunderstanding:

317
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,239
I didn't come here
for you, Princess.

318
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,808
I'm here to grab
that jackpot rice cake!

319
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,578
Bring me that cart full
of rice cakes right now!

320
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,647
You'll exchange it
for the Princess' life!

321
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,581
Move it!

322
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:22,216
If you don't hurry,
I'll break her neck!

323
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,551
Wait! I'll get it!

324
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,087
Guess we have no choice
but to do what he says.

325
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,189
So an underling
sizes up the situation

326
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,058
faster than the samurai, eh?

327
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,626
Fine! Fetch that cart!

328
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,527
Bring it to me!

329
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,762
Okay, sure. No problem.

330
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,264
But, the jackpot
rice cake isn't on it.

331
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,568
Then, where is it?

332
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,137
You can find the jackpot--

333
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,172
No! Don't!

334
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,774
With our lord.

335
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:50,744
Oh? Is that so?

336
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,781
It's right there.

337
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,586
What?

338
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,121
You mean, you're not even
gonna put up a fight for it?

339
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,389
Not at all.

340
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:14,367
What? It's empty!

341
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:15,736
A-ha!

342
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,238
So that's where that
big red nosed thief went!

343
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:21,475
You tricky little cheater!

344
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,744
You flashily deceived me!

345
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,247
It's Buggy, isn't it?

346
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,548
Take a look outside the window,

347
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:29,716
at the people below.

348
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,554
Hey! Be careful!

349
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,189
Stop breaking the castle!

350
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,490
Listen up, Big Nose!

351
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,759
There's no way I'm letting
you steal that jackpot!

352
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,427
Like I said, it's empty!

353
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,430
I'm gonna beat you
'til you cry, you hear me?

354
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,532
As I was saying,
outside that window

355
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,568
are the citizens of this town.

356
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,271
Citizens who've looked
forward to this event all year.

357
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:52,439
This tradition is
held on their behalf

358
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,509
to start the new year off
with a renewed sense of hope.

359
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,144
It's a chance
to test their luck.

360
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,747
The outcome is
entirely up to fate.

361
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,584
But the opportunity to win must
be given equally to everyone.

362
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:06,153
Handing over that prize
in advance is unfair,

363
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,454
and destroys that hope.

364
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,325
If you truly want that jackpot,

365
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,292
you'll have to go down there,

366
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:14,395
wait for the tossing,
and test your luck.

367
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,762
Just like everybody else.

368
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,099
Just as we've come to
expect from you, my lord.

369
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,367
Splendid persuasion.

370
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,535
I'm very impressed.

371
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,372
Hey, my lord.
Can we get this going?

372
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:28,042
If we don't hurry, Onami is
gonna beat the crap outta me.

373
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:29,643
Insolent fool!

374
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,312
How dare you speak
to our lord that way!

375
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,746
Show some respect!

376
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,248
Forget it!

377
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,217
I don't need your useless prize!

378
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,686
But I won't be made
a fool of, understand?

379
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,291
I've thought of
something even better

380
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,560
than your jackpot, my lord.

381
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:48,128
If I kill you, I wouldn't need

382
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,331
that paltry jackpot of
10 million Ryo-Berries.

383
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,632
I'd have everything
in the entire country

384
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,367
at the tip of my fingers!

385
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,402
So now. Since it's come to this.

386
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:59,105
I'm going to flashily
blow you away! Men!

387
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,007
Sir!

388
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,177
You'll regret trying to
make a mockery of me!

389
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,279
Prepare the Special Buggy
Ball! Brace yourselves!

390
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:10,183
Sir! The Special Buggy Ball
is loaded and ready!

391
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,022
All righty, then!
Blow them away!

392
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:34,908
Whoa, look!

393
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,743
The rice cake tossing has begun!

394
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,083
You tricked me!

395
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,485
The jackpot may or may not be

396
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,420
among the ones we just shot out.

397
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,756
Well, he did say he
didn't want it anymore.

398
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:49,757
You smug punks!

399
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,359
That was obviously
just a slip of the tongue!

400
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:56,396
You're in the way. Get lost!

401
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,235
Thank you for your hard work!

402
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,212
All right guys, you know
what you have to do!

403
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,748
Find that jackpot rice
cake no matter what!

404
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,449
Anything for you, my dear!

405
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,494
The mighty castle of Alabasta,

406
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,097
which has stood proudly
for a thousand years,

407
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,800
now has three gigantic
holes in its tower.

408
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,635
And it's all because of him.

409
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,570
Straw Hat Luffy!

410
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:39,106
Sorry, but he already
went down below

411
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:40,574
with the others to
pick up rice cakes.

412
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,080
What's wrong, Igaram?

413
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,581
Don't you want
to toss rice cakes?

414
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,583
This is no time for
such frivolities, my lord!

415
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,752
This tower is the
stronghold of the castle!

416
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,054
Damage of this magnitude
has never happened here!

417
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,624
This will hurt the pride
and dignity of our country!

418
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:58,626
Our pride and dignity
are in no danger.

419
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:00,261
What?

420
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,463
Look, Igaram.

421
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:05,299
See how happy the
people down there are?

422
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:06,734
A country is its people.

423
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,136
Their vitality is the
source of our dignity,

424
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,571
their resilience our strength.

425
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,640
This country won't fall
into decline over something

426
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,642
as petty as the
appearance of this castle.

427
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:18,044
Here you go!

428
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,248
As long as the people
are filled with happiness,

429
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,417
our country will remain strong.

430
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,386
And I have an
obligation as their lord

431
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,187
to help keep them that way.

432
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,489
While we ran into some trouble,

433
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,491
everything worked
out in the end.

434
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,793
That's all we can
ask for, isn't it?

435
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:34,495
"A country is its people".

436
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:37,064
That's certainly the
truth, isn't it, Father?

437
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,165
Wouldn't you agree, Igaram?

438
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,271
Indeed, it is.

439
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:45,972
But, my lord.

440
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,142
Who's going to
cover the expenses for

441
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,344
all the repair
work needed here?

442
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,613
We will, of course!

443
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,247
Yes, my lord.

444
00:21:57,517 --> 00:22:00,287
Hey. You're being a
little too greedy, Boss.

445
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:01,522
Not here, either.

446
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,291
Which one has the jackpot?

447
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,661
Onami. I can't eat anymore.

448
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,096
Sorry to keep you waiting!

449
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:11,131
I gathered up some more!

450
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,732
No!

451
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,368
Come to think of it, Father.

452
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,503
Where's the rice
cake with the jackpot?

453
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:20,774
Oh, that's right!

454
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:23,410
In all the hubbub,
I forgot about it!

455
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,545
I wonder who's going
to be lucky enough

456
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,479
to get their hands on this.

457
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:28,014
Here!

458
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,527
All right! I finally
got a rice cake!

459
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,132
Thank heavens!

460
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:45,966
What the hell?

461
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,468
Is there some
kind of seed inside?

462
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:51,672
I can't eat crap like this!

463
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,539
Oh, my!

464
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:55,575
I guess he's not
interested in a fortune!

465
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,362
My strength. I'm getting weaker.

466
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,064
What the hell did you do to me?

467
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:20,067
So, have you solved
the mystery of my powers?

468
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,403
Because you're about
to fully experience them.

469
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:23,804
You didn't think I'd
just stay on the floor

470
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,739
and give up without
a fight, did you?

471
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:28,776
If you think I'm all looks,
you're in for a big surprise.

472
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:29,643
Bring it on!

473
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,278
On the next One Piece:

474
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:33,047
"Bubble Master Kalifa!

475
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,481
The Soap Trap Closes

476
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,684
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
