1
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,957
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

2
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,661
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

3
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,997
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

4
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,800
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

5
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,570
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

6
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,271
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

7
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,241
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

8
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:57,077
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

9
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,679
they capture the
unwanted attention

10
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,247
of the World Government,

11
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,483
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

12
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,987
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

13
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,357
I can't wait to see what kind
of adventure's up next!

14
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,593
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

15
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:18,198
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

16
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,804
[NARRATOR] Separated from the
rest of the Straw Hat crew,

17
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,806
Luffy is headed to
Navy Headquarters

18
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,176
in order to rescue
his brother from death.

19
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,079
However, there are
only three hours left

20
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,815
before the public execution
of Portgas D. Ace.

21
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,359
[LUFFY] "Ticking Down
to the Time of Battle!

22
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,361
The Navy's Strongest
Lineup in Position!"

23
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,472
[GUARD A]
Stand up.

24
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,289
Start climbing.

25
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,821
[MERCHANT A] You think
Whitebeard's gotten there yet?

26
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,923
There're only three
hours left now.

27
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,294
Eh. I'm starting to wonder
if he's gonna show up at all.

28
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,595
I know the guy's serious news,

29
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,598
but isn't he a little
bit too old for a war?

30
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,200
You really think so?

31
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,534
He's been tearing up the seas

32
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,503
since before the
Great Pirate Era.

33
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,905
Do the math, he's
gotta be senile.

34
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,273
And it's been a few years now

35
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,475
since his name
made any headlines.

36
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,912
[OLD WOMAN] You're all fools
for taking this so lightly.

37
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,648
You need some proof
of how serious this is?

38
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,418
They've manned Navy HQ
with their entire fleet

39
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,853
and brought in their
elites as a precaution.

40
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,257
I would bet my life savings
Whitebeard's gonna show.

41
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,992
Just you watch.

42
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,095
So, whaddya think is gonna
go down when he does?

43
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,732
[OLD WOMAN] No idea. How the
hell am I supposed to know?

44
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,974
[MAN A] Whitebeard's living in
a completely different era now.

45
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:50,310
Does he stand a chance?
Taking on the entire Navy?

46
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,912
He's bound to fail if he does.

47
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,248
No pirate can attack Marineford.
It just isn't possible.

48
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,917
[MAN B]
It's happened before.

49
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,653
I wanna say it was
about 20 years ago now.

50
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,022
But a pirate called
Shiki the Golden Lion

51
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,091
invaded Marineford and
managed to leave at least half

52
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,994
of the Navy
Headquarters in ruins.

53
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:12,132
This time, though, I can promise
you it's gonna be much worse.

54
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,803
It's bound to be a colossal
massacre no matter who wins.

55
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,076
[MAN B]
Let's just hope he doesn't show.

56
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,777
The execution would happen,

57
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,680
but one death is
better than thousands.

58
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,126
[BARKEEP] You want me to open
the bar on a day like this?

59
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,162
The whole world's about to
go to war any minute now!

60
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,363
Just go back home!

61
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:45,933
I'll open up tomorrow if
we're all still alive!

62
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,968
Then sell us some bottles to go!

63
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,736
There's no reason
for ya to treat us

64
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,639
like we're on the
execution block!

65
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:54,507
You expect us to live
without drinking?

66
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,312
[MAN IN BAR] Everyone talks
like he's just some old man,

67
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,981
but we all know it ain't true.

68
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,649
How long's it been now?

69
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,951
Couldn't have been
more than a year

70
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,988
since he walked in here and
sat right there across from me.

71
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,663
We all thought we were dead men.

72
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,332
[MAN C] Is Whitebeard
really as nefarious

73
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,201
as everyone makes him out to be?

74
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,668
[MAN D]
Heh. You kidding?

75
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,971
Even those kids know. Just
listen to their little song.

76
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,907
[KIDS]
Whitebeard, Whitebeard,

77
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:29,109
he's so mean,
he's so feared.

78
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,477
[KIDS laughing]

79
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,013
[NUN]
Oh, Lord, I'm so afraid.

80
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,915
Where is this world headed?

81
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,684
Please help us through
these awful times.

82
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,195
[NARRATOR]
On the island of Marineford,

83
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,531
home of Navy headquarters,

84
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,133
there lies a large city
primarily populated

85
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,235
by Navy families.

86
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,037
But not today.

87
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,314
[NARRATOR]
For their safety,

88
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:11,284
an evacuation order has been
issued to all residents.

89
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:19,360
[NARRATOR] At the evacuation
site on the Sabaody Archipelago,

90
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,595
the displaced residents
anxiously wait

91
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,031
to view the execution
on giant monitors.

92
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,404
[NARRATOR] Journalists and
cameramen from across the world

93
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,273
have also gathered here to break
the news of the proceedings

94
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,942
as quickly as they unfold.

95
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,246
Jeez. The Navy's really
not messing around.

96
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,082
That's the best they've got.

97
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:42,083
Yeah.

98
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:44,818
Whitebeard's gotta
know what's in store.

99
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:49,256
So the question is,
does he wanna risk it?

100
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,191
[NARRATOR] Every look-out
ship the Navy has sent out

101
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,928
in search of Whitebeard
has been swiftly sunk.

102
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,132
And yet, there have been no
sightings of the pirate himself.

103
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,101
The tension looming
over Marineford

104
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:05,472
rises with each passing second.

105
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:09,276
And with less than three hours
left until the execution,

106
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,847
the sickening suspense is
soon to grow unbearable.

107
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,329
Damn. It ain't right.

108
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,698
And I don't see
why it's necessary.

109
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,569
I understand your reservations,

110
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,739
but this isn't some simple
execution of a pirate.

111
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,675
You have to think about
what's at stake here.

112
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,745
The significance it has
on the future of the world.

113
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,047
That's why it's necessary.

114
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,753
I know it's difficult for you,

115
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,089
but you are deeply
involved in this matter.

116
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,124
The responsibility lies
on your shoulders.

117
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,063
[SENGOKU] And you better
not forget it, Garp.

118
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,365
[MARINES shouting]

119
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,934
Get those in place!

120
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,202
You! Pick up the pace, now!

121
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,612
[LACROIX]
Don't let your guard down!

122
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:56,950
No matter what we face,
it'll only last three hours!

123
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,119
After that, it's all over!

124
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:04,858
[MARINES]
Yeah!

125
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,094
[NARRATOR] The Navy has summoned
its most elite soldiers

126
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:12,766
from all over the world,
totaling almost 100 thousand.

127
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,102
With a focus on the
crescent-shaped bay area,

128
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,672
the island is protected
by 50 Navy warships.

129
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,907
On top of that,
the surrounding walls

130
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,777
have been armed with a
countless number of cannons.

131
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,512
And positioned front and center

132
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:31,184
before the vast throng
of marshaled forces...

133
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,521
...stand five of the Navy's
most ferocious allies,

134
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,190
the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

135
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,080
[MARINES gasp]

136
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,349
They're here.

137
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,651
It's the Admirals.

138
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:09,356
Is it just me, or are they even
scarier than the Warlords?

139
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,924
[NARRATOR]
Closely guarding the scaffold

140
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,260
from the foot of the structure,

141
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,430
both revered and feared,

142
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:19,332
the three Marine Admirals.

143
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,086
[MARINES cheering]

144
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:42,256
[NARRATOR] On this day,
every force of order

145
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,492
the World Government can gather

has been unified to stand
against the Whitebeard Pirates

147
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,399
in the imminent battle
over the life of one man.

148
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,424
[ACE]
Luffy, listen.

149
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,793
There's only one
way to live life,

150
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,495
and that's without any regrets.

151
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,964
[LUFFY]
Uh-huh.

152
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,923
[ACE] Someday, we're
gonna head out to sea

153
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:54,195
and live the way we wanna live.

154
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,897
More free than anyone else.

[grunts]

156
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,145
I can see it!

157
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,081
Hey! Jimbei!

158
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,750
It's the Gate of Justice!

159
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,785
We made it!

160
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:52,586
That was really fast!

161
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,421
It should've been faster!

162
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,359
We would've arrived a lot sooner
if the winds had been right.

163
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,327
We're here, but...

164
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,329
Now let me explain your future.

165
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,766
Your fates depend on whether
we open the Gate of Justice.

166
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,236
As long as we leave it closed,
you can't get to Marineford.

167
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,672
You can't even get out
of the Tub Current.

168
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,640
You will be completely stranded.

169
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,376
There is no sea for
you to escape to.

170
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,979
The question now

171
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,682
is how we're supposed
to get through the gate?

172
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,985
Well, men, y'know
what time it is?

173
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,455
Huh? Let me hear it now!

174
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,123
[PRISONERS]
It's time for Captain Buggy

175
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,625
to conquer the entire world!

176
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,360
And lemme hear the rest!

177
00:16:33,394 --> 00:16:36,163
[PRISONERS]
Navy HQ's goin' down!

178
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,467
And Whitebeard's goin' down!

179
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,969
And who is the next
King of the Pirates?

180
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,437
[PRISONERS]
Captain Buggy!

181
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:48,609
[laughing]

182
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,411
And don't you forget it!

183
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:56,449
--[PRISONERS] Buggy! Buggy!
--[BUGGY laughing]

184
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,322
Ace.

185
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,753
[CROWD gasping, whispering]

186
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:36,456
Hey, look. They're bringing
out Fire Fist Ace.

187
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,094
Wow, so that's him.

188
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,629
He looks like just anyone else,

189
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:44,498
but every step he takes
could throw all of us

190
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,499
into an unthinkable war.

191
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,972
Alive or dead,

192
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:56,209
he's responsible for our fates,
and the whole world's.

193
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,474
Okay, Garp, I'll
do the talking.

194
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,877
Go ahead. I'll be
waiting downstairs.

195
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:40,954
[SENGOKU]
Step aside for a minute.

196
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:41,988
[GUARDS]
Yes, sir.

197
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,791
It's the Fleet Admiral.

198
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,226
What's he doing?

199
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,762
Pass me a Snail.

200
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,796
[GUARD A]
Sir.

201
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,776
[SENGOKU]
I have some information

202
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,877
you all need to hear.

203
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,686
This man is Portgas D. Ace,

204
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,255
and the significance
of his impending demise

205
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:18,124
is more profound
than you may realize.

206
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:23,130
None of this is
your fault, Garp.

207
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,433
[GARP laughing]

208
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:27,467
Can't hold back those
motherly feelings

209
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,636
during dark times, Tsuru?

210
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,838
Ace.

211
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,641
I would like you to tell them
the name of your father.

212
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:34,674
[grunts]

213
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,545
[JOURNALIST B]
His father?

214
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,380
What's that have
to do with anything?

215
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,089
The name of my father
is Whitebeard.

216
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,157
Not true!

217
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,291
Yes, it is!

218
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,828
Whitebeard is my father!
My only father!

219
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,163
[SENGOKU]
We launched a painstaking

220
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:59,266
and exhaustive search for you
around the time of your birth.

221
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,635
When we heard rumors that
your father had a child,

222
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,005
we took them very seriously.

223
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:05,338
Thanks to Cipher Pol,

224
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:09,076
a small but reliable amount of
information was presented to us.

225
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:12,312
Based on this, we
checked all newborns,

226
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,981
as well as all preborn children.

227
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,249
We spoke to many mothers,

228
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:18,619
but no matter how far
and wide we searched,

229
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,355
we couldn't find you.

230
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:22,757
No surprise, though.

231
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,658
Especially when you
consider the lengths

232
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,660
your mother went to to hide you.

233
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,929
She performed a miracle
that could only come

234
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,730
from the love of a mother.

235
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:38,138
As a result, she
misled the Navy.

236
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:42,309
No. She managed to
mislead the world.

237
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:46,981
You come from an island in
the South Blue called Batelira.

238
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,649
And your mother's name?

239
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:52,819
Portgas D. Rouge.

240
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:55,189
She pulled off a feat
that completely defied

241
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:59,093
the laws of nature,
all to protect her child.

242
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:03,863
She kept her baby inside her
womb for an entire 20 months.

243
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,402
No, that's impossible.

244
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,971
[SENGOKU] And once she
finally gave birth to you,

245
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,740
she lost all of her strength

246
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,642
and passed away
right then and there.

247
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,646
And thus, a year
and three months

248
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,450
after the death of his father,
a child was born with the blood

249
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,720
of the world's most odious
villain in his veins.

250
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,992
That child was you.

251
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:37,297
[SENGOKU]
Surely, you must know the truth.

252
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,674
[ACE'S FATHER]
They can't persecute someone

253
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:48,943
who's yet to be born.

254
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,445
Right, Garp?

255
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,347
So please look after my child.

256
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,318
[SENGOKU]
Your true father...

257
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:06,793
...is Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates!

258
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:32,787
So, for all these years,
Gold Roger had a son?

259
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,259
[CROWD gasping, chattering]

260
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:40,627
This is massive news.

261
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,863
Call the head office!
Issue an extra!

262
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,934
Then it survived.

263
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,472
His bloodline.

264
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,946
[REUDER]
Roger's bloodline lives!

00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,762
[NARRATOR] The secret of
Ace's birth is revealed.

266
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,666
Saved by the determination
of his father, Roger,

267
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,468
the hope of his mother, Rouge,
and the mercy of Garp,

268
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:23,737
he entered an unwelcoming world.

269
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,674
Now, he must rely on the help
of his loved ones once more.
