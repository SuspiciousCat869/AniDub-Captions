00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.071
[NARRATOR] Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:08.074
attained every treasure
that the world had to offer.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.810
Smiling, even as he
stood upon the scaffold,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.113
he issued a challenge
to the world.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.381
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.482
You can have it!

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.351
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.587
Now, you just have to find it!

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.555
[NARRATOR]
Now, those who dare to dream

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.559
hoist their flags and sail
into the Great Pirate Era!

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.025
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.928
must brave the second
half of the Grand Line.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:47.133
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.302
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.703
to ever chart these waters

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.939
and learn all the
secrets they held.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.874
For the rest of the
pirates of the world,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.277
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.514
A graveyard of dreams.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:04.617
Now, Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body became rubber

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.219
after eating the Gum Gum Fruit,

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:09.923
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:14.027
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.898
[NARRATOR] During their
journey to the New World,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.668
Luffy and his crew arrive
on Fishman Island,

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.772
which is located 10,000
meters below sea level.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.107
The Fishman Pirates,
led by Hordy Jones,

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:33.446
and assisted Vander Decken,
plot to overthrow King Neptune.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.381
It's not long before
the Straw Hats

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:36.983
get pulled into the conflict,

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.520
and find themselves in the
midst of an all-out war!

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.890
[HORDY]
Perhaps.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.025
But even if you could stop it,

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.628
you would still have to
go through me first.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.129
And if memory serves,

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.465
that didn't work out
so well last time.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:55.168
[laughs]

00:03:56.402 --> 00:04:00.240
[FUKABOSHI]
Hordy, what's happened to you?

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:02.308
There're people living
in the Fishman District

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.677
who were once your allies!

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.547
What you're doing doesn't
benefit anyone--not even you!

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.817
Why can't you see that, Hordy?!

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.924
Is there something I don't know?

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.926
Or is your hatred so deep

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.396
that you've abandoned your
sense of reason entirely?

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.531
Tell me the cause
of this madness!

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.899
Did humans attack you?

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.003
Did they torment you
in some untold manner?

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:33.373
Did they kill your friends?
Did they hurt your family?

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.975
Did they take something
you hold dear?

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.510
Answer me, dammit!

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:41.314
What did humans do to you
that was so unforgivable?

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:45.318
Why? What in this world
could inspire such cruelty?

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:53.559
[inaudible]

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:02.735
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
This is the Air Tank.

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.103
We've met before, remember?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.339
Oh. Yeah, hey, guys.

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:07.273
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
We've been listening

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:10.043
to what's happening out there.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:12.912
And we can see the Noah
hurtling toward the island.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.848
We've begun making the
preparations as we've discussed.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.584
Don't make it more complicated.
Just go for it, okay?

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:21.954
And, Luffy? Everyone here
is counting on you.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.659
[FUKABOSHI]
Can you hear me, Straw Hat?

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:36.469
[roaring]

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.608
[FUKABOSHI]
Please, listen.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.814
[FUKABOSHI]
He spoke earlier, and--

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.653
[FUKABOSHI]
It's clear now. Hordy is--

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.221
[yelling]

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:56.656
Hordy.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:03.863
[laughing]

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:12.538
[LUFFY] "A Shocking Fact!
The True Identity of Hordy!"

00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.349
[NARRATOR]
Earlier that day,

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.753
before the Noah began
its descent on the island.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:32.792
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:37.597
[WADATSUMI yells]

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.214
[WADATSUMI]
Ow, my knee!

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.119
You jerk!

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:03.389
You've really made me
mad, you know that?!

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.359
[yells]

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:09.729
This is what you get!

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.366
Intimidation... Mega Monk!

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.741
[WADATSUMI yells]

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.377
C'mon, he was big
enough already!

00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:35.421
Am I supposed to be impressed?

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.057
[laughing]

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.660
[WADATSUMI]
Well, you're surprised, right?

00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:44.931
I'm a tiger blowfish
Fishman. Scary, huh?

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.332
Not really.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.734
Kinda curious why you're
talkin' like that, though.

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.637
'Cause I'll deflate if I keep
my mouth open, you idiot!

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.208
The kraken is still
way bigger than you.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.476
[WADATSUMI]
Oh, yeah?

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.744
Fine, then how 'bout this?

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.112
Blowfish!

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.447
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE P]
This is so annoying!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:03.216
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE Q]
Don't crush me, dammit!

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.450
Stop it, Wadatsumi!

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:08.421
We're on your side!
You're squashing all of us!

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.623
[SANJI] Still a shrimp
compared to the kraken.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:14.327
Impossible! Well, how's this?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.428
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES screaming]

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:17.330
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATE R]
Enough, you moron!

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.672
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
We have come, Your Majesty!

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:30.276
Are you all right down there?

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.111
I'm so sorry, my king.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:35.781
We should've been able to
protect you and we failed.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.317
We're pathetic,
worthless vassals!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.619
[NEPTUNE]
Never mind that.

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:42.221
More importantly,
did you see the Noah?

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.623
Yes.

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:47.159
[NEPTUNE] Tragic that it's been
moved under such circumstances.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.794
Curse you, Decken.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.763
I never thought you
would sink so low

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.899
as to destroy your own island.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:54.934
And your own people.

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.335
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Trust me, Your Majesty,

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.471
we were just as
shocked as you were.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:01.607
We even tried to order
an island-wide evacuation.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.743
But those New Fishman
Pirate bastards

00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:07.246
are blocking any transmission.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.315
Even worse, we haven't
been able to make contact

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:11.551
with the border
guards out at sea.

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:12.852
[ringing]

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.487

Prepare to shoot the bubble now!

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.855
[AMMO KNIGHT C]
Hurry!

[TRANSPONDER SNAIL A ringing]

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.628
See? They won't pick up!

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:26.198
You need to get the king out
of here and someplace safe now!

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.601
[NEPTUNE]
No.

00:09:28.634 --> 00:09:32.204
I'm waiting right here
for the princes.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:39.011
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT sighs]

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:42.882
What in blazes?

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.920
Someone explain this.
What's happening?

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:51.257
Like for starters, where did all
these damn pirates come from?

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.693
[FISHMAN N]
Well, sir...

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.628
[inaudible]

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.934
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
The Straw Hats are on our side?

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:06.806
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Jimbei!

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.208
And the princess?

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.777
Hordy. Decken.

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.814
So that's what happened.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.051
All right, men.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.454
Everything is clear to me now.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.590
All of you, to the plaza!

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:29.695
Follow Jimbei.
Back up the Straw Hats!

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:32.665
If the Straw Hats can handle
the more powerful fighters,

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.234
our men can supress the others.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:36.435
It's insane.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:37.603
We tried to arrest them,

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.939
yet they're fighting
to save our island.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.376
We should be ashamed
for not trusting them.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:47.246
It's time to make things right
and give them our support!

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.881
[AMMO KNIGHTS]
Sir!

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:50.516
Great, it's Neptune's Army.

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.618
Hey, no big deal.
We can crush 'em.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:53.786
Kill them all!

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:56.822
Stand tall, and show these
bastards what we're made of!

[SLAVE A yells]

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.464
Why the hell is
a human fighting us?

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.003
[HAMMOND]
Move, slaves! Attack!

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:14.507
Get out there and fight for us,
unless you wanna die!

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:17.743
Ha!

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:21.881
[AMMO KNIGHTS scream]

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:24.016
[HAMMOND laughs]

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.719
Hurry up! March, Slave Tank!

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.954
Turn right and head that way!

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:33.392
Whoopsie!

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.562
Worthless klutz!
Just drag the bastard!

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.067
Look at that pathetic flesh bag.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.269
Replace him! C'mon!

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:45.404
[HAMMOND laughs]

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:48.507
That's truly disgusting.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.043
They all reek of hypocricy.

[ROBIN]
Hm?

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:56.649
Could you perhaps use your
power to free those slaves?

00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.851
Really? Are you
sure that's wise?

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.352
They won't care for Fishmen.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.654
I'll knock them unconscious

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.756
if they try to take their
grudge out on me.

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:06.525
Because the life that
they're living right now,

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.961
they're even lower than beasts.

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:12.631
This behavior was learned
from the Celestial Dragons.

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.533
I won't stand for it.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.872
All right. Count on me.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.173
Thank you.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:28.481

the pace, you trash!

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.983

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:33.552
Dammit! Die already!

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.229
All our collars, they came off!

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:44.930
Hey! What's the deal here?

00:12:44.964 --> 00:12:49.401
The hell? Who's taking the
collars off of the slaves?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.837
Hey, woman. You're a
Straw Hat, aren't ya?

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:54.440
Turn around and face me
when I'm talkin' to you!

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:58.711
What the hell is wrong
with you worthless slaves?

00:12:58.744 --> 00:12:59.712
We're free.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:00.713
Was it you?

00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:03.649
Why save us when we were
fighting against you?

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:06.218
I can't say no to
a handsome man.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.788
In other words,
thank Boss Jimbei.

00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:10.756
Jimbei? But--

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.993
How dare you! They're mine!

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:15.461
Trawl Net!

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:19.598
[HAMMOND laughs]

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.700
Let's put you in chains!

00:13:25.037 --> 00:13:26.105
[gasps]

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:30.109
Cuerpo Fleurs!

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.645
What the hell?
This is getting weird.

00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:38.884
No! Cut that out!

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:42.054
Just relax.
This won't take long.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.023
Let go!

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.859
Hang on, how are
there two of you?

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.428
Double... Clutch!

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:54.333
[HAMMOND groaning]

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.901
She got Hammond!

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.203
We'll teach her!

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:59.205
[NEW FISHMAN PIRATES yelling]

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:01.240
Thanks a whole lot
for the help, lady.

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:03.375
You bastards treated
us like trash.

00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.443
I'm gonna pay ya back

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:06.812
for every beating you
gave me, and then some!

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.281
The enemy just freed
all our slaves!

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:11.650
It's a revolt!

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:15.087
[SLAVES yell]

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:25.097
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B ringing]

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.965
[TRANSPONDER SNAIL B]
Ca-click.

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:26.966
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
This is the border guard

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.334
patrol calling, sir.

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.169
Have I reached the
Minister of the Left?

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.437
You have.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.772
I've been frantically trying to
call you over and over again,

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.974
why didn't you pick up?

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.109
[AMMO KNIGHT A] I don't
mean to be insolent, sir,

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.278
but I'm afraid there's no
time for me to explain

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.746
with our situation.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.349
Please, you need to warn
the whole kingdom.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:44.683
It's the Noah, sir.

00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.819
We've just been informed
it's lost power.

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:48.721
As a result, it's
begun falling again,

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.823
and it's hurtling
towards the island!

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.094
Surely not!

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.396
[NEPTUNE]
What could this mean?

00:14:57.429 --> 00:14:59.064
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Where are you calling from?

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.300
[AMMO KNIGHT A] The Air Tank,
sir. From the control tower.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.534
That's good.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:05.704
That means you can warn everyone
about the impending danger.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.707
All our communication
centers are down.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:09.875
But you can help.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.945
You can contact the state-
operated Transponder Snails

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:14.446
all across the country.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.581
Please, hurry!

00:15:15.614 --> 00:15:16.715
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Yes, sir!

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:22.688
[sirens wailing]

00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:24.223
[AMMO KNIGHT A] This is an
emergency announcement

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.692
to all citizens of
the Ryugu Kingdom.

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.527
An evacuation has been issued.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.396
The giant ship known as the Noah

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:33.499
is falling towards
Fishman Island.

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:36.969
Everyone must flee
the area immediately.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.288
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
I repeat, the Noah is descending

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.523
on the island!

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:01.694
Everyone must flee immediately,
or face certain destruction!

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:03.562
Is this for real?

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.164
Look up there!

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:07.700
[FISHMAN O]
The Noah. You can see it!

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:10.035
[FISHMAN P]
Is Decken behind this?

00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:12.171
What, are you really
that surprised?

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:13.806
That damn creepy stalker.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:15.841
I can't believe he
would go this far!

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:17.343
[FISHMAN Q]
The bubble's gonna break!

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.678
[MERMAID D]
The island will be destroyed!

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.649
Keep running! Just
forget about your stuff!

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:24.650
[FISHWOMAN A]
But--

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.485
[FISHMAN R]
Get out to sea, quick!

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:33.025
[FISHMAN E] Everybody, move it!
The Noah's coming!

00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.360
Did something bad happen?

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.829
I heard the princess was drawing
the ship away from the island.

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:38.430
Yeah, I'm worried about her.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:41.166
We can't just swim off
and abandon her now!

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.103
What about the Noah crashing
into the island do you not get?

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:45.070
I just--

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.638
[FISHMAN E]
Do you guys really wanna waste

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:50.309
the princess's effort by
staying here and dying?

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.144
[MERMAN B]
We have to leave the island!

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.212
[MERMAN C]
To the sea!

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.848
[MERMAN D]
C'mon! Hurry!

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:57.850
Aw, jeez! That thing's
falling again?

00:16:57.883 --> 00:17:01.086
Damn. You better fix
this mess quick, Luffy!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.156
Something must have happened
to Princess Shirahoshi.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.026
What's Decken trying to pull?
That crazy son of a bitch.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:10.629
We've got no choice but to run.
That ship will kill us all.

00:17:13.332 --> 00:17:15.901
You can leave Hordy
and his associates to us.

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:18.570
All of you citizens are
ordered to flee the island.

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.272
Now get going!

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.112
What's wrong with
you? I said go!

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.580
[KIDS]
No way!

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.950
[MINISTER OF THE RIGHT]
Wait, what?

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.186
Women and children especially.

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.621
C'mon! Move it!

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.122
[KIDS]
We told you no!

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.458
The Straw Hats may be a
bunch of human pirates,

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:42.594
but they're all down there
fighting to save our island!

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:44.596
We can't just run away
and let them die

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.532
when they're trying to help us!

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.033
He's right!

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.201
We asked them to help us

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.370
and I'm not gonna turn
my back on them!

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:52.538
I can't fight with 'em,

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:54.773
but I won't leave them
here to die and run away!

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:55.908
Yes, exactly!

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.377
It's the least we can do!

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.612
Quiet, all of you!

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.048
Listen up.
I'm assigning you a duty.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.452
Tell every other spectator they
need to evacuate right now!

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:09.388
If you're gonna stay, then save
the others while you're here!

00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:10.989
Is that understood?

00:18:12.591 --> 00:18:15.094
I don't have time to
argue with you about it,

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:18.464
so if you wanna stay
behind, suit yourself.

00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.505
All right, outlaws,
time to face my wrath!

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:32.311
[speakers humming]

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:35.380
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
Is this Straw Hat Luffy?

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:37.983
All right. It's the Air Tank.

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.519
We've met once before, remember?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.057
What is this? They're
broadcasting to the pirates?

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.592
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
We've heard everything.

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.861
We are prepared to take action.

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:52.431
We can see the Noah hurtling
toward the island as we speak.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.832
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Huh?

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.802
[SHIRAHOSHI] Oh, Luffy.
I don't know what to do!

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.904
[MINISTER OF THE LEFT]
Do you hear those fools?

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:00.772
They're broadcasting
their conversation

00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.941
across the entire country.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.009
[LUFFY]
Hey, guys.

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.712
What do we need to do to
get a little air from you?

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:09.615
[AMMO KNIGHT A] We can shoot out
all the air in the Air Tank.

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.017
If we create a big
bubble and shoot it,

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.585
maybe it'll surround the Noah.

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:17.856
[NEPTUNE]
Shirahoshi. Straw Hat.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.458
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
I'm afraid that's all we can do.

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:22.127
After we deploy the bubble,
the rest is up to you.

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.862
[LUFFY]
Don't make it more complicated.

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:24.963
Just go for it, okay?

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.100
Luffy's still all right.
Thank goodness.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.035
He sounds as optimistic as ever.

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:32.571
Hey. C'mon, it's Luffy
we're talkin' about--

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:33.972
I knew he'd be okay.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.674
I don't understand
what's going on.

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:36.909
What is he doing here?

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.111
And more than that, what's
the princess doing with him?

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:41.980
Yeah, the Straw Hat guy is the
one who kidnapped her, right?

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.649
He's a human.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.451
[AMMO KNIGHT A]
And, Luffy,

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.887
everyone here is
counting on you.

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.956
Anyone else confused
why the border guard's

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:53.592
asking a human pirate
to save the island?

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.628
Hold on, does this mean that
the human is on board the Noah?

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.298
So is he trying to stop it?

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:08.207
[FUKABOSHI]
Can you hear me, Straw Hat?

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:12.211
What? Prince Fukaboshi!

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:14.947
He spoke earlier, and--

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:21.787
[FUKABOSHI]
It's clear now. Hordy is--

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:33.665
[laughing]

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.301
Keep talking!

00:20:36.335 --> 00:20:38.971
Just tell us what
Hordy is already!

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:50.816
He's not a Fishman.

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:54.019
He's a monster brought
to life by our hatred.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.955
Their hatred?

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.591
What is he talking about?

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.593
[FUKABOSHI]
The New Fishman Pirates,

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:05.464
they're nothing but remnants
of a grudge from ages past.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.900
[laughs]

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.639
[FUKABOSHI]
We allowed their evil to fester

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.375
in the shadow of Fishman Island.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:20.345
And they began to champion
this meaningless grudge.

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:24.016
Flying its flag in some
misguided sense of pride.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.486
They fear a future without it.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:30.355
In truth, they want
humans to be evil.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:34.626
Otherwise, there is no reason
to justify their crusade.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.896
All they desire is bloodshed.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.164
And despite what they say,

00:21:39.197 --> 00:21:41.566
they don't want peace
for Fishmen either!

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:48.006
[screams]

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.179
[FUKABOSHI]
Answer me, dammit!

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:58.183
What did humans do to you
that was so unforgivable?

00:21:58.216 --> 00:22:02.254
Why? What in this world
could inspire such cruelty?

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:09.194
Not one damn thing.

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:10.429
[gasps]

00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:14.766
[FUKABOSHI]
That? That's your answer?

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:24.276
The simple truth? We were chosen
by heaven to punish the humans.

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:26.311
That is our purpose.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:32.384
[HORDY]
And we have the power to do so.

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.723
[FUKABOSHI]
I understand now.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:40.692
This sick and pathetic truth.

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:50.168
All of their fury, their hatred,

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:54.106
it doesn't come from
experience or logic or fact.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.575
[laughs]

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:58.944
[FUKABOSHI]
They have no substance.

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:04.783
[FUKABOSHI]
Just empty cruelty!

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.693
[NARRATOR]
Hordy's hatred runs wild

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:17.763
as Luffy continues to struggle
in his undersea battle.

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:19.998
A single shot of air
fired from Fisman Island

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.400
is Luffy's only hope.

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.769
Yet, even if the oxygen
on the Noah is restored

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:27.239
and Hordy defeated, the ship
itself could doom the island.

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:29.608
Luffy vows to save
the Fishmen below,

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:31.977
but their lives may
never be the same.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.945
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:37.249
"Back to Zero!
Earnest Wishes for Luffy!"

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:39.851
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
