177
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,349
[USOPP]
Oh!

178
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,975
Speaking of weapons,
I'm gonna use these

179
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,144
to make Nami's
Clima-Tact stronger!

180
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,813
Not to mention my slingshot!

181
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:16,231
I can't wait!

182
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:26,032
[USOPP]
So, where's everybody else, huh?

183
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,951
Luffy and the others
are still inside,

184
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,745
and Robin went off by herself.

185
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,498
[SNAKE snoring]

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,377
[USOPP] The snake's
still conked out, huh?

187
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,379
He must be really tired.

188
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:42,424
[ZORO] You'd be, too, if you
danced for four days straight.

189
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,634
I wonder what he
was so happy about...

190
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,302
Anyway, I hope
they come out soon.

191
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,638
When he wakes up, I don't
know how friendly he'll be.

192
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:49,973
[USOPP]
Huh? Who?

193
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:51,891
This well-mannered snake?

194
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:55,020
Easy for you to say. You didn't
see him when he was mad.

195
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,104
He's dangerous.

196
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:57,856
[USOPP]
Who? This well-mannered snake?

197
00:10:57,939 --> 00:10:59,315
[ZORO]
Like I said, you didn't see him.

198
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,067
Just wait till he
tries to eat you.

199
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,944
You'll see what
a pain he can be.

200
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,779
[USOPP]
Who? This well-mannered snake?

201
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,073
Usopp, are you
even listening to me?

202
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:08,158
[USOPP chuckles]

203
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,951
[USOPP]
Who? This well-mannered snake?

204
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,536
Fooled ya with a tone dial!

205
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,912
Stop being so stupid!

206
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:14,539
[USOPP laughs]

207
00:11:14,622 --> 00:11:15,749
[USOPP]
Me? Stupid?

208
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:17,959
But you're the one
who got fooled! Ha ha!

209
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:19,961
[SANJI]
What the--?

210
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,088
And I thought
Luffy ate too much!

211
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:23,590
[NAMI]
Are we there yet?

212
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,091
[LUFFY]
There! I told ya!

213
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,760
Wow! Is it...?

214
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,678
Yep, the real deal!

215
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:29,929
It's a bell!

216
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:32,390
Just like the ones the
big monkeys showed us!

217
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,017
[GROUP laughing]

218
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,810
[LUFFY]
See? See? See?

219
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,271
There's so much stuff!

220
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:39,814
And it's all ours!

221
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,858
So, that's it.

222
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,611
[ISLANDER E]
Amazing.

223
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:27,904
[ISLANDER F]
It's beautiful.

224
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,156
[ISLANDER G]
I didn't expect it to be so big!

225
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,741
[ISLANDER H]
It's magnificent!

226
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:35,328
[WARRIOR O] Oh, but look, one of
the side columns is broken off.

227
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,372
[ISLANDER I]
Yeah. What a shame.

228
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,165
Hey, look!

229
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,793
Over there! Under the bell!

230
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,712
The Poneglyph.

231
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,839
[WARRIOR P]
That thing?

232
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,924
So that's the stone our
ancestors gave their lives

233
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,175
to protect?

234
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,181
[WARRIOR Q] Chief, the words
that are inscribed on it.

235
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:57,308
What do they say?

236
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:59,144
It's an ancient text.

237
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:04,607
Impossible to read.

238
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,235
"We shall know the true meaning
and utter it to no one."

239
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:11,031
"It's our legacy to
be the inheritors of history,

240
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:12,741
and our duty to protect
it with the sounding

241
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:14,117
of the grand belfry."

242
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,328
[CHIEFTAIN]
Th-Those words!

243
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:18,913
How do you know them?

244
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:21,583
[ROBIN] They were inscribed on
a wall in the ruins of Shandora.

245
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,793
Generations ago,
your people were entrusted

246
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,337
to be its guardians, correct?

247
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,803
[CHIEFTAIN]
You...

248
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:36,431
You can actually read
those ancient characters?

249
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,229
[ROBIN] It mentions Poseidon,
an ancient weapon

250
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,065
named after a god.

251
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,192
It even gives its whereabouts.

252
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,109
[ISLANDER J]
Are you certain?

253
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,361
[ISLANDERS whispering]

254
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:50,695
Ancient weapon?

255
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,490
But why would it say
something like that?

256
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:54,699
[ISLANDER L]
How odd.

257
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:55,867
[ISLANDER M]
Yeah.

258
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:58,578
[ROBIN]
Another weapon.

259
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:01,206
One different from
Pluton of Alabasta.

260
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:03,083
[CROCODILE]
Pluton.

261
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,251
Legend has it that it can
completely obliterate

262
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,337
an island with just one shot.

263
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,882
[ROBIN] And to think there are
dangerous things like this

264
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:15,345
out there in the world,
all just waiting to be found!

265
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,597
Just another dead end.

266
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,558
This isn't what I was looking
for or what I wanted to know.

267
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,311
Uh, hey, Miss?

268
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,106
Is that stuff engraved on the
side part of the Poneglyph, too?

269
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,780
[ROBIN]
Gol D. Roger!

270
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,200
[ROBIN gasps]
What?

271
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,287
[GOL D. ROGER] I made it here,
and I will guide this passage

272
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,832
all the way to the farthest
ends of the earth.

273
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,334
The stormiest seas
will not stop me.

274
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,086
Pirate Gold Roger.

275
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,756
The Pirate King?

276
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,428
Then this could only mean that
he came to the sky islands!

277
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,596
But what in the world
could his words mean?

278
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,892
And more importantly,
how was he able

279
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,729
to understand and use
this ancient language?

280
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,192
So it says "Roger," does it?

281
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,318
[ROBIN]
You know him?

282
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:13,445
[GAN FALL]
Ah, yes.

283
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:15,071
A Blue Sea pirate.

284
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,781
I met him when he
came to this land

285
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,117
over 20 years ago.

286
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,245
I take it that his name
is inscribed there?

287
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:23,496
[ROBIN]
Yes.

288
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,582
Honestly, I have no idea
how he managed

289
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:28,585
to reach this bell,
but somehow he did.

290
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,004
And this inscription is
proof that he was here.

291
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:38,553
Wait a minute.

292
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,474
Now that I think about it,

293
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:45,226
there are two kinds
of Poneglyph stones:

294
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,270
ones that contain information,

295
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,522
and others that tell how
to reach other Poneglyphs

296
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:50,899
scattered throughout the world.

297
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:55,445
This stone obviously
has information.

298
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,866
"I made it here, and I
will guide this passage

299
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,202
all the way to the farthest
ends of the earth."

300
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,915
Guide this passage.

301
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,041
Guide.

302
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,339
Could he...

303
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,216
Could he mean the Rio Poneglyph?

304
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:26,434
Chief. This Poneglyph.

305
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,603
Its duty has been fulfilled.

306
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,854
[CHIEFTAIN]
Its duty?

307
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,275
Yes. I have a hunch
about these Poneglyphs.

308
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,903
As I said, there are certain
ones spread across the world

309
00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:38,363
that contain information.

310
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:40,323
By reading them as one,
I believe they'll form

311
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,534
a passage that will
reveal the true history

312
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,744
of the Blank Century.

313
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:47,497
In other words,
the passage completed

314
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,374
by connecting them
is what will make up

315
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:53,545
a legendary final Poneglyph
that's yet to be discovered.

316
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:55,880
The Rio Poneglyph.

317
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,008
Gol D. Roger must have
taken the text

318
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:00,218
from the Poneglyph
here to the island

319
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:03,013
where the Rio Poneglyph
may very well be located.

320
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,769
He must have--

321
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:11,813
Does that...

322
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:15,233
Does that mean our duty
has been fulfilled as well?

323
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:19,904
[crying]

324
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,907
Does that mean we...

325
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,577
...don't have to
fight any longer?

326
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,329
[crying]

327
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:32,625
Then our ancestors'
wish has been fulfilled?

328
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,169
[crying]

329
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:35,628
--[FAT VEST] Chief!
--[FRINGED SHOULDERS] Hang on!

330
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,047
[ZIPPERED COLLAR]
Are you all right?

331
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,092
[CHIEFTAIN] Thank goodness!
Our war is finally over!

332
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,308
[ROBIN] Well, I'd better
get to fulfilling my duty.

333
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:50,935
Like Roger before me,
I have to guide this passage,

334
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:52,604
and the other ones I've read,

335
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,564
all the way to the end
of the Grand Line,

336
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:56,232
to the island of Raftel.

337
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,611
[GAN FALL]
Well, then. Where were we?

338
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:00,945
Ah, yes.

339
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:03,531
I was about to tell you
how much your friend

340
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,493
in the straw hat
reminds me of Roger.

341
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:09,454
That boy is... interesting.

342
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,956
His name's Monkey D. Luffy.

343
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,209
And I find him
interesting as well.

344
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,253
D? So the lad even shares
the same middle initial

345
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:18,380
as Roger?

346
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,507
[laughs]

347
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:22,926
Yes.

348
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,928
And I'm sure there's got to be
some historical significance

349
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,137
to that.

350
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,598
Pardon me, Miss.

351
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:30,433
But I recall you and
your friends saying

352
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:31,893
that you sought gold.

353
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,937
And didn't you say
it was more valuable

354
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,814
than Vearth on the Blue Sea?

355
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,232
[ROBIN]
Yes.

356
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:38,942
[CHIEFTAIN] We obviously
can't offer you the belfry,

357
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:41,111
but how about
the broken support?

358
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,404
[PONYTAIL]
That's a great idea!

359
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,322
We have to give something
to our heroes,

360
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,783
and that's a perfect token
of our appreciation!

361
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,159
[ISLANDER N]
Please take it!

362
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,327
[ISLANDER O]
We insist!

363
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:52,122
Uh, thanks!
But are you sure about that?

364
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:53,331
[CHIEFTAIN]
Uh-huh.

365
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,543
[ISLANDER P]
All right, everybody!

366
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,671
Let's bring this gift to our
friends from the Blue Sea!

367
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:01,673
[ISLANDER Q] If we wrap it up,
it'll be easier to carry!

368
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,633
[ISLANDER R] It's gonna take
every one of us to move it!

369
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,427
[ISLANDER S]
Yeah, you're not kidding.

370
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:14,728
Aww...

371
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,354
Come on, Robin.

372
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,981
We can't wait too long.

373
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:19,482
[stomach growls]

374
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:21,317
I'm so hungry.

375
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:22,569
[stomach growls]

376
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,321
[SANJI]
There's not a soul in site.

377
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,407
I've gotta admit,
this is pretty weird.

378
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,868
Wonder where all those
angels and warriors ran off to,

379
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,369
and why.

380
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,163
[USOPP]
Hey, be thankful they're gone!

381
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:35,290
Trust me, if they see us
making a run for it

382
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,959
with all the loot we pulled
from their favorite giant snake,

383
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,627
well they're not gonna
be too thrilled!

384
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,421
Nami and Conis probably
already have the ship

385
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,423
ready to sail by now,
so Robin better hurry

386
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:45,592
and get back here quick!
We gotta go!

387
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:46,885
[LUFFY]
I'm hungry, Sanji.

388
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,053
Got anything to eat?

389
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:50,388
Nope. All the food's
on the ship.

390
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:53,016
[LUFFY] You've gotta have
something to munch on, right?

391
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,018
--Come on, gimme something!
--[ZORO] I've had enough!

392
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,811
I'm tired of just
sittin' around.

393
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,064
You guys can wait for her.
I'm gonna go to the ship.

394
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,231
Moron!

395
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:01,191
Jerk!

396
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,150
What are you?

397
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:03,526
[CHOPPER]
Stupid head!

398
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:10,241
[arguing]

399
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,287
Hey, look! It's Robin!

400
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,123
Hi, hot stuff!

401
00:20:17,207 --> 00:20:19,250
Hey! Robin!

402
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,586
Hurry up! Run!

403
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,962
We've gotta leave!

404
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,589
We stole some gold!

405
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,717
Stop it! Look, you moron!

406
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,595
Right behind her! See them?
They can hear you, too!

407
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,181
[CHOPPER screams]
It's an army!

408
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:38,061
[USOPP yells]
Oh, no! Not good! Not good!

409
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,479
[yelling]

410
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:41,189
That big thing can
only be one thing!

411
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:41,940
[CHOPPER]
What?

412
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:42,941
[USOPP]
A cannon!

413
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,068
A cannon!

414
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,445
Just our luck they'd
all come back at once.

415
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:50,323
[LUFFY]
Robin! Get the lead out!

416
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:53,743
We've gotta get back
to the ship now!

417
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:55,370
Check out this gold!

418
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,540
I bet we found every
piece on the island, huh?

419
00:20:58,623 --> 00:20:59,916
From here, it looks
like they've already

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,418
packed their bags!

421
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:04,379
Oh, no!
They're not leaving already!

422
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,839
Hold on, you guys!

423
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:07,048
Don't go!

424
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,384
Oh, great! Here they come!

425
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,678
[LUFFY]
Run!

426
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,681
Well, I guess it's up
to me to handle this one.

427
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:16,057
Da da da da da!

428
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,600
Stop? Stop, you say?

429
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:18,768
Like hell we'll stop!

430
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:20,812
[LUFFY]
Yeah! You tell 'em, Usopp!

431
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,274
We risked life and limb
to come to this island

432
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:25,692
--in the sky!
--[LUFFY] Yeah, we did!

433
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,153
And then we found
the city of gold!

434
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,280
So you think we
pirates are leaving

435
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:34,075
empty-handed, you've got
another thing coming!

436
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,952
Capture them?
What's he talking about?

437
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,413
The only thing we're trying
to do is thank them!

438
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:40,248
[LONG MOHAWK]
Uh, Miss, is there a problem?

439
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,542
You and your friends
want this gold, right?

440
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,920
[ROBIN chuckling]

441
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,172
I guess we don't!

442
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,715
[CROWD]
What?

443
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,592
Please wait!

445
00:21:53,803 --> 00:21:58,099
[LUFFY]
Let's go!

446
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,476
[CHOPPER]
I can't turn around!

447
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,686
I know they're chasing us!

448
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,689
[USOPP laughs] Zoro, didja see
me take care of 'em back there?

449
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:07,817
[ZORO laughs]
Yeah! Not bad!

450
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,695
Hey, Robin! Better hurry up!

00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,074
[CROWD]
Hey! Come back! Wait!

452
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:19,537

We'll split the treasure once
we get back down, okay?
