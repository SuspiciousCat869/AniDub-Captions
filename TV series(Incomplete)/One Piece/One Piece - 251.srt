1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:08,408
Give me Tom back!

2
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,112
Superior, huh?

3
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,614
All right, Chief.
Go ahead.

4
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,550
Hot! Hot! Ouch, ouch, ouch!

5
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,352
I spilled coffee
all over myself!

6
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,554
Dammit! Stupid coffee!

7
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,824
What the heck?

8
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,726
So, you're still alive.

9
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,395
Greetings Cutty Flam.

10
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,529
Hm?

11
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,465
Long time no see.

12
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,200
It's hard to believe

13
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,436
you somehow managed to
survive the "accident."

14
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:54,275
Hard to believe but
good news, nonetheless.

15
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,244
Is that so?
Who are you?

16
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,046
Don't you remember me?

17
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,052
I'm the man from Cipher Pol
Number 5 that arrested

18
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,321
Tom's Workers when
I caught them red-handed

19
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:13,394
for savagely attacking the
Judicial Ship 8 years ago!

20
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,195
You're that Spanda
guy, aren't you?!

21
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,430
Spandam!

22
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:17,397
You're missing the M!

23
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:21,368
But I'll have plenty
of time to drill that

24
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,038
into your head once
you arrive at Enies Lobby!

25
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,439
Make it quick, men.

26
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,542
I'm simply dying to teach
that criminal a lesson!

27
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,318
Damned stupid lamp!

28
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,518
Tie him up.

29
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,159
Hey punk!
Watch those hands!

30
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,326
Come on.

31
00:03:54,668 --> 00:04:00,708
Let him go!

32
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,476
Come back here, you bastards!

33
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,217
Uh. I'm sorry.

34
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,385
Hey!

35
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,720
If you're not gonna help,
then don't get my hopes up!

36
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:16,724
Wait, I know you, don't I?

37
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,658
You're part of the
Straw Hat crew.

38
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,572
"The Truth behind Her Betrayal!

39
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,374
Robin's Sorrowful Decision!"

40
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,349
Last train of the day
is cutting it kinda close.

41
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,518
Wonder what the
government's got in mind.

42
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,320
Dunno, but it must be serious

43
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,821
if they're going out
during Aqua Laguna.

44
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,057
Yeah, that sounds about right.

45
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,692
I heard the people
getting on tonight

46
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,060
are big-shot secret agents!

47
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,695
That's news to me!

48
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,697
Some folks from the
Navy were talking about it

49
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,332
just a few minutes ago.

50
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,368
From what I gather, the
government sent this team

51
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,637
of undercover agents to
Water 7 a bunch of years ago

52
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,339
and they just now
finished their mission.

53
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,473
Nice timing.

54
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,041
No kidding!

55
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,409
'Course I didn't
hear the details.

56
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,778
Who knows what they
were doing all these years.

57
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,450
And you said these guys were
undercover, now didn'cha?

58
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,118
That means they might be
people we already know.

59
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,191
Actually, you're right.

60
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,258
Now, keep this a secret

61
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,195
but I think I might have
a good idea who they are.

62
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,330
Who? Tell me!

63
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,170
What?! From the backstreets?!

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,371
Mhmm...

65
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,475
I've caught them having some
real hush-hush conversations

66
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,077
in the corner over
at Blueno's Bar.

67
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,144
That might be a little fishy,

68
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,481
but I don't think it means
they're secret agents.

69
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,582
It's not just that.

70
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,184
They're always spending
money and living like kings,

71
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,053
even though they
hardly work at all.

72
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,120
That's a good point.

73
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:30,291
I've seen them ride first
class quite a few times.

74
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,225
See?

75
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,427
Well, whether I'm right or not,

76
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,163
we'll find out their secret
identities soon enough.

77
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,300
After all, they'll be boarding
the sea train any minute now.

78
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,269
Mark my words this'll be the
talk of the whole town tomorrow!

79
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,037
I'm sure!

80
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,147
No good!
The wind is too strong!

81
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,648
It's getting worse!

82
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,285
If Iceberg's in there,
we gotta get him out now!

83
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,769
Iceberg!

84
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,470
Paulie!

85
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:31,585
Nami! Oh no, I have to
treat her right away.

86
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,020
If can just--

87
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,500
Hurry!
They need first aid!

88
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,101
They're burned all over!

89
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,035
Hey!

90
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,370
What're we gonna do
with this reindeer?!

91
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,170
Help him!

92
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,538
He saved their lives!

93
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:52,773
Y-You're right.

94
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,407
Hey! Someone gimme a hand!

95
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,314
Oh boy.

96
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,585
That's just sad.

97
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,459
So what you're saying is
that you left the Straw Hats,

98
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,428
but you haven't given
up your life of crime.

99
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,797
What a shame.

100
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,266
If you're a pirate,
you're coming with us.

101
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:20,200
Kalifa.

102
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,668
Got it.

103
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,740
And as for this ship.

104
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:30,077
You still haven't
disposed of it?

105
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,345
Stay away!

106
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,246
Don't you dare touch her!

107
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:46,226
Are you listening to me?!
What're you doing?!

108
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,197
Even if it was only
a temporary disguise,

109
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,666
we are still respected
as shipwrights.

110
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,107
When we say your
ship's done for

111
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,576
then you would do
well to listen to us.

112
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,813
What do you care?!
It's not even your ship!

113
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,215
I can do whatever
I want with it!

114
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,717
This lever releases
the water, right?

115
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,421
Cut it out! That's not
funny, damn it! Hey!

116
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:29,636
No, stop it!
Don't let her fall!

117
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,484
Don't worry.

118
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:47,420
I'll carry everyone
for a little bit longer.

119
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,474
Merry!!

120
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,718
Get back!

121
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,486
Run away!

122
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,189
Come on!

123
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,391
You idiot! Run!

124
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,766
Dammit! Isn't there
anything we can do?!

125
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,712
Look! Mr. Iceberg's awake!

126
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,716
All right! He's safe!

127
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,351
I knew he'd make it!

128
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:53,320
Go Galley-La!

129
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,155
That reindeer saved his life!

130
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,089
Are you sure?

131
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,658
I thought it belonged
to the Straw Hats.

132
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,031
Hey! Look!

133
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:09,169
This woman's from
the Straw Hats, too!

134
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,038
So what now?

135
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,440
Do you think maybe we should
tie her up and question her?

136
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,343
I dunno, she's just a
girl and she's hurt, too.

137
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,113
I know, but--

138
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:19,980
Whoa!

139
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,082
You shouldn't be
moving yet, Mr. Iceberg!

140
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,493
Sorry men but I need a
little space, right now.

141
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,363
That is to say, I want to
speak to this woman in private.

142
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,295
Wonder what those
two are talking about.

143
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,197
Beats me.

144
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,699
What was that for?!

145
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,168
Stop standing there
and gimme a hand!

146
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,769
I know Iceberg and
Paulie are safe,

147
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:18,505
but the rest of the foremen
might still be trapped inside!

148
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,074
Yeah, he's right!

149
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:20,641
Let's go.

150
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:25,379
Oh, uh. Yeah, sorry!

151
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,516
Mmwell, first off
I must apologize.

152
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,120
I falsely accused
your entire crew.

153
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,690
I'll try to clear that up soon.

154
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:40,394
But for now, I want to
talk about Nico Robin.

155
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,696
What do you know?

156
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,267
When you first came to Water 7,
did she start acting strangely?

157
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,768
Yeah, she did.

158
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,205
She went into town that day
and then never came back.

159
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:55,075
By the next morning she
was the prime suspect

160
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,677
in your attempted murder.

161
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,313
When Sanji and Chopper
finally saw her again,

162
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,649
she said this was goodbye

163
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,817
and wouldn't be a part
of the crew anymore.

164
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,420
Of course, none of that
made any sense to us

165
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,589
so we decided to break
into your mansion,

166
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,157
in hopes that we'd
be able to see her

167
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,127
one more time and
find out the truth.

168
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,796
I did it to make
my wish come true.

169
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,732
One that can't happen as
long as we're together,

170
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,335
if you can't accept
that, I'm sorry.

171
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,038
What kind of wish
would force her

172
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,241
to give up all of her friends?

173
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,743
I think I know the
answer, actually.

174
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,183
This probably started
shortly after you lost sight

175
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,286
of her for the first time.

176
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,221
CP9.

177
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,324
The government had
begun its operation

178
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,425
the moment she arrived.

179
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,163
In other words,
there's a good reason

180
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,098
why your friend
did what she did.

181
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,534
But before I go
into the details,

182
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,703
I want you to understand
that both Nico Robin

183
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:58,272
and I have the means to
revive an ancient weapon

184
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,075
that is capable of
destroying the entire world.

185
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,143
Huh? A weapon?

186
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,645
That's right.

187
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,581
Puru-puru. Puru-puru. Click.

188
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,716
It's me.

189
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,618
We've hit a
snag in the plan.

190
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,754
Everyone head to the
bedroom immediately.

191
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:18,525
Don't shoot Iceberg yet.

192
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,728
Do you understand now?

193
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,731
The blueprints that
they found are fake!

194
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,601
I don't care.

195
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,436
I would rather die
than hand over

196
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,472
that information to
the government.

197
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,107
But now it's not that simple.

198
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,242
If you've decided that
you're going to help them

199
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,611
and you're searching for
the Poneglyphs yourself.

200
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:42,182
Then I have to do
everything I can to stop you!

201
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,817
I understand your concern,

202
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,619
but I'm only studying
the poneglyphs

203
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,554
to learn more about the
history of the world.

204
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,758
I don't care about the weapon.

205
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,627
You have to
take responsibility!

206
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,331
I told you this would happen.

207
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,501
But you don't listen.

208
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:04,238
Franky, even if you
weren't trying to.

209
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,574
Weapons are made
to hurt people.

210
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:12,580
Whether you want them to or not,
they can hurt your friends.

211
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:14,648
Even if you don't have
malicious intent,

212
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,151
your actions can
still hurt people!

213
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:20,087
If your curiosity for history
leads to the destruction

214
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,323
of the world then you're
better off dying

215
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:25,458
right here and right
now, Nico Robin!

216
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,330
Even after seeing what
happened to the devils of Ohara,

217
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,733
you still want to
walk this path?!

218
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,669
You don't know a damned
thing about Ohara!

219
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,508
You have no idea how
much the World Government

220
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,544
has warped my life,
do you hear me?

221
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:51,184
If you hate the government
so much then why help them?!

222
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,660
Because I have a wish that
I would sacrifice anything for.

223
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,235
When I came to this town,

224
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:11,105
CP9 presented me
with two conditions.

225
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,540
The first was to pin
your assassination

226
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,410
on the Straw Hats
and leave their crew.

227
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:20,147
The second was to turn
myself over to the government

228
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,317
and follow their every
order without question.

229
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,486
You realize, they
won't let you live.

230
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,755
You escaped them for 20 years.

231
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:31,725
Why would you agree to
something like that now?

232
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,729
In this particular instance,
CP9 has been given

233
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:39,366
permission to activate a Buster
Call against the Straw Hats.

234
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,136
A Buster Call?

235
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,105
It's an emergency order that
summons five vice admirals

236
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,276
and ten battleships
to the same location.

237
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,078
No matter how strong you are,

238
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:56,383
no one can survive a full-scale
military attack of that caliber.

239
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,453
Under normal circumstances,
only the three admirals

240
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,655
and the head of the
navy, the fleet admiral,

241
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,191
are allowed to exercise
that kind of authority.

242
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,361
However, this is a special case.

243
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,330
Just this once,

244
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:14,268
Admiral Aokiji has given CP9
the right to make the call.

245
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,769
When I heard his
name, I surrendered.

246
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,072
If I hadn't agreed to
their conditions, then me

247
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:22,409
and the rest of the Straw Hats
would've been annihilated.

248
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,745
For the past 20 years I've been
able to run away and survive,

249
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,615
no matter what the
circumstance but that's only

250
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:31,085
because I had nothing to
protect because I was willing

251
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,487
to betray others and
use them as a shield.

252
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,655
But not now.

253
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:40,761
For the first time in all
these years I can't do that.

254
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,264
They picked up the
life I gave up on,

255
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:48,202
returned the heart I lost
and continued the dreams

256
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,604
that I no longer believed in.

257
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,539
Even after all I've done,

258
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:57,311
I've found friends who
will still believe in me.

259
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:02,249
I see but then
what is your wish?

260
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,453
That excluding me all of
the other Straw Hat pirates

261
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,155
will be allowed to
leave this island safely!

262
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:12,660
And as long as
you have that,

263
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:16,730
you don't care what happens to
you of the rest of the world?!

264
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,632
I don't.

265
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,340
I've heard all I can take.

266
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,551
In the end, I couldn't
pull the trigger.

267
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,434
She was willing to
sacrifice the lives

268
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,703
of everyone in this
world, even her own.

269
00:18:55,736 --> 00:19:00,341
As long as she could
save the six of you.

270
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,409
She was protecting us.

271
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,178
As much as I hate to admit it,

272
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,213
I have no right
to criticize her.

273
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:10,150
If they find the blueprints
now, it's all my fault.

274
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,258
Hey! What's wrong?

275
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,063
I'm happy, that's all.

276
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,332
I was so worried.

277
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,701
I didn't want to
believe she betrayed us.

278
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,473
I gotta find everyone
else and let them know!

279
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:33,741
Thank you, Iceberg!

280
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,776
Hold on! What are you
going to do now?

281
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,545
The Straw Hats have
already lost to CP9!

282
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,314
What do you mean we lost?

283
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,449
We haven't even
started fighting yet!

284
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,786
We wouldn't be here right
now if we gave up that easy.

285
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,355
Luffy will get Robin
back, you'll see.

286
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,291
We just needed
motivation, that's all.

287
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,162
Now that we know
Robin needs saving.

288
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,365
There's no limit to
what we can accomplish!

289
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,538
Chopper! Great news!

290
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,676
C'mon Chopper, wake up!
We have to find everyone!

291
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:09,844
You can sleep
when you're dead.

292
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,047
You sure you wanna do that?
He's in pretty bad shape!

293
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,715
Wake up! Wake up!

294
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,450
Wake up!

295
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,118
Hey, Chopper.

296
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:19,687
Go meet up with
Luffy and the others

297
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,590
and tell them everything that
happened between us and Robin.

298
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,558
I don't want you to
leave out a single word.

299
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,493
Sure.

300
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,063
As for me, let's
just say I have a plan.

301
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:33,066
I'll try to be careful.
We'll meet up later.

302
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,405
Something wrong?

303
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:43,276
Do you think Robin
doesn't like us anymore?

304
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,114
Chopper.

305
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,515
Hm?

306
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,051
Let me share a
secret with you.

307
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,755
When a woman tells a lie...

308
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,426
...a real man forgives her.

309
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,697
Attention all
passengers boarding

310
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,066
today's final service
to Enies Lobby.

311
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,369
Due to the current water level,
we will be departing

312
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:10,271
from the platform
on the second floor.

313
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:13,540
Boarding time is 11:00 PM.

314
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,775
Let's go see who they are!

315
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,576
Yeah!

316
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,049
This is a top-secret
operation we're running here.

317
00:21:22,082 --> 00:21:24,318
The agents must
board in private.

318
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,552
No fair.

319
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:35,562
How considerate of you
to finally turn yourself in.

320
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,265
20 years is a
long time to run.

321
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:53,046
Bingo.

322
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:14,561
So wait.

323
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,664
You mean Robin doesn't
hate us after all?!

324
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,666
We have to find the rest
of the crew right away

325
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,301
so we can go rescue Robin!

326
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:22,403
Sounds great, but
where are Luffy and Zoro?

327
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:23,204
I don't know!

328
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,605
That's why we
have to find them!

329
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,340
We've only got
half an hour left!

330
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,541
Wait for us, Robin!

331
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,176
I don't care who
you're up against!

332
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,144
We'll help you!

333
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,545
On the next One Piece:

334
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:34,081
"The Steam Whistle
Forces Friends Apart!

335
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,016
The Sea Train Starts to Run."

336
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:38,518
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
