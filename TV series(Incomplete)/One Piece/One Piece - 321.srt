1
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,389
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:40,327
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,563
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:48,735
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,438
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,606
You can have it!

7
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,009
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,212
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,582
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,651
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:08,321
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,291
[CHIMNEY] Hey, pirate people!

13
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,526
--[GONBE] Meow!
--[KIWI and MOZU] Straw Hat!

14
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,863
[ALL panting]

15
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,297
[LUFFY] You need something?

16
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,332
Franky wants to
talk to you guys.

17
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,835
He's got something
big to show you!

18
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,637
It's been a long night,
but they finished

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,038
his ship of dreams!

20
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,742
And boy is it super cool!

21
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,143
Meow!

22
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:32,513
Huh? You mean it's done already?
That was really fast!

23
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,614
[MOZU] Of course!

24
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,181
That's what happens
when the best shipwrights

25
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,750
in the world
work around the clock!

26
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,851
[KIWI] You better believe it!

27
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,619
What're we
waiting for? Let's go!

28
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,054
Yeah!

29
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,924
[ZAMBAI] Straw Hat!

30
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,726
We've got bad news!

31
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,395
[KIWI] Oh, hey, you guys!

32
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,898
[MOZU] What's going on?
They look upset.

33
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,599
[KIWI] I wonder what's wrong.

34
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,637
[panting]

35
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,506
To be honest, we just found
out about this ourselves.

36
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,675
Have you seen
the wanted posters?

37
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,143
Wanted posters?

38
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,545
[ZAMBAI] You've got a huge
bounty on your head, Straw Hat!

39
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,980
They're gonna
hunt you down for sure!

40
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,849
Actually,
you've all got bounties.

41
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:10,785
The whole crew is wanted!

42
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,887
Took long enough! How much?

43
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,054
Not me, too!

44
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,656
I'm wanted?!

45
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,757
No point in talking, just look.

46
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,728
[ZAMBAI] Wanted posters
for all seven of you.

47
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:28,636
[ZAMBAI] Straw Hat Luffy with a
bounty of 300 million Berries.

48
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,837
[laughs]

49
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,072
All right! It went up!

50
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,141
[ZAMBAI] Pirate Hunter
Zoro with a bounty of

51
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,443
120 million Berries.

52
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,778
[chuckles]

53
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:41,715
[ZAMBAI] Cat Burglar Nami with
a bounty of 16 million Berries.

54
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,050
No!

55
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,186
[ZAMBAI] Cotton-Candy
Loving Chopper. Pet.

56
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,454
With a bounty of 50 Berries.

57
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,789
Ah--fifty?

58
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:53,293
[ZAMBAI] Demon Child Robin with
a bounty of 80 million Berries.

59
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,331
Who is that?

60
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,669
[ZAMBAI] Black Leg Sanji.
Attempt to take a photo failed.

61
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,437
Bounty: 77 million Berries.

62
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,041
[sighs]

63
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,543
Hey look,
Sniper King has one, too!

64
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,445
Only fifty?

65
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,581
Well I know this is probably
big news for you and all,

66
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,283
and I'm sure there's
a lot of pirate stuff

67
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,219
you want to talk about,
but uh, hold on a sec okay?

68
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,855
I came here 'cause I gotta
favor to ask of you guys.

69
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,457
Take a look at this.

70
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,192
It's Franky!

71
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,496
[ZAMBAI] Cyborg Franky, with a
bounty of 44 million Berries.

72
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,666
This is awful, Big Bro's wanted
by the World Government!

73
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,134
What're we gonna do now?

74
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,636
Yeah, that's the question.

75
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,305
I was so happy when I found out
we didn't have bounties.

76
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,240
But then this had to happen!

77
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,509
Everyone in the whole
city knows about our bro.

78
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,711
He can't stay
in Water 7 anymore!

79
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,180
And if he gets arrested again,

80
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,848
I don't think we'll have
the power to save him

81
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,183
like we did last time!

82
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,418
[ZAMBAI] But I'm sure he's
worried about us, too.

83
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,887
Knowing him, he probably
wouldn't leave the island

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,022
no matter how much
we begged him.

85
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,858
That's why we came to you.

86
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,292
We have no other choice!

87
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,094
We're begging
you here, Straw Hat.

88
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,296
Even if he tries to fight,

89
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,798
you gotta take our
bro out to sea with you!

90
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,001
Come on!
His parents were pirates--

91
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,535
It's in his blood!

92
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,105
Please, Straw Hat!

93
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,874
All we want is
what's best for our bro!

94
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,110
[FRANKY FAMILY]
Please, you gotta help him!

95
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,081
Come on, you guys
don't have to beg.

96
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,784
I already decided I was gonna
make him my shipwright.

97
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:24,752
[FRANKY FAMILY gasps]

98
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,986
[ZAMBAI] You mean it?

99
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,455
And the rest of you
are okay with that, too?

100
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,623
[SANJI] My face.

101
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,692
Ugh. I don't care anymore.

102
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,426
Uh...

103
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,762
Of course.

104
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,129
Well, there you have it.

105
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,233
Ah! Thank you.

106
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,201
Now that they've agreed,
it's time to move!

107
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,170
C'mon! You know
what we gotta do!

108
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,971
[FRANKY FAMILY] Yeah!

109
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,773
[cheering]

110
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,409
But wait, where are you going?

111
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:51,411
Yeah, Scrap Island
is that way, remember?

112
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,480
[ZAMBAI] I can't tell you.

113
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,316
I'm sorry, but we've got
some dirty business to do.

114
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,420
You're better off not knowing.

115
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,255
Mozu. Kiwi.

116
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,024
Thank you for all you've done.

117
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,972
[LUFFY] The King of Animals
that Overlooks the Sea!

118
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,074
The Dream Ship
Magnificently Completed!

119
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,846
All right, then.

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,082
Just to make sure, are we all
on the same page about Usopp?

121
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,551
[NAMI] Ah...

122
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,353
Heh. Yeah.

123
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,522
This is about
doing what's right.

124
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,391
I know. Let's move!

125
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,392
You've been depressed
for long enough.

126
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:42,429
Shut up! Why's mine the
only one with a drawing?

127
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,666
Who cares about the picture?
You've got a bounty!

128
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,302
Who is this, huh?
'Cause it's not me!

129
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,672
I thought it was a photo
'til you said something.

130
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,806
[blubbering]

131
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,808
[ZORO] Who has a
handsome face, again?

132
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,143
[SANJI blubbering]

133
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,013
All the women in the
world are gonna laugh at me.

134
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,315
Uh! That guy lied to me.

135
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,284
He said he was a reporter
for the local paper.

136
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,353
[NAMI] Having a bounty
kind of stinks,

137
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,256
but on the upside, the picture
turned out pretty cute.

138
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,024
I fought like a
true man back there!

139
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,593
I'm a pirate just like
all the rest of you!

140
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,028
And what do they mean by pet?
I'm a doctor, darn it!

141
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,664
Am I really only
worth 50 Berries?

142
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,131
Well, try harder then!

143
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,701
[MOZU] Hurry up, Straw Hat!
What're you doing in there?

144
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,235
[LUFFY] Huh?

145
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,739
Don't you wanna
see your ship?

146
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,507
Can't keep our big bro waiting!

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,009
I know, I know!

148
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,145
Well, hope we're not
forgetting anything!

149
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,880
Once we get Franky and
our new ship, we're outta here!

150
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,183
Hey. Sanji's not
moving anymore.

151
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,985
Guess we'll just
have to find a new cook.

152
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,320
[SANJI] What? Just gimme
a minute, damn it!

153
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,256
Please, Pirate Lady!
Can't you stay a little longer?

154
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,960
Chimney. I'm sorry.
Thank you guys for everything.

155
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,595
Mmm.

156
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,775
[CAPTAIN 321A] This is
certainly an unusual case.

157
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,277
There may not be many of them,

158
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,280
but every member of their crew
has a bounty on their head.

159
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,917
[CAPTAIN 321A] They're worth
over 600 million total.

160
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,185
Impressive.

161
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,853
But I was wondering...

162
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,055
What about this
"Black Leg" character?

163
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,424
Why is there no photo of him?

164
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,858
[ATTACH] I--well--

165
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,095
I assure you, sir,
I did take one,

166
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,898
but look at what happened
when I developed the film!

167
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,632
It's quite unsettling.

168
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,802
The photo is completely black!

169
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,772
[CAPTAIN 321A] Did you
by any chance forget...

170
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:34,341
to take off the lens cap?

171
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,078
[ATTACH] Hm?

172
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,747
[MOZU] Big Bro!

173
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,250
[KIWI]
We brought the Straw Hats!

174
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:51,225
[snoring]

175
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,494
[KIWI and MOZU]
Big Bro, where are you?

176
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,830
They're here.

177
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:58,031
Oh. I see something big!

178
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,266
[CHOPPER] You think that's it?

179
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,103
Hey Franky!
We're ready for our ship now!

180
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,937
Oh, hey Ice Pops, what's up?

181
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,038
[ICEBERG] Good to see you.

182
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,606
Yeah you, too,
but where's Franky?

183
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,443
Unfortunately, Franky
can't be here at the moment.

184
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,545
[ICEBERG] But the ship
is indeed complete.

185
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,713
Shall we take a look?

186
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,515
Uh-huh!

187
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,484
I think you're
going to be impressed.

188
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,086
I was floored simply
looking at the blueprints.

189
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,221
This ship can sail any sea.

190
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,125
[ICEBERG] It may take you to the
end of the Grand Line after all.

191
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:25,893
Just let me see it already!

192
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,294
Hurry!

193
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,795
[ICEBERG] There's a message
that Franky asked me

194
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,297
to pass on to you, Straw Hat.

195
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,798
He said that
if you're going to be

196
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,100
the King of Pirates someday...

197
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,709
[ICEBERG] ...then your ship
should be the King of Beasts!

198
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,446
It's amazing!

199
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,014
--You can say that again.
--Uh huh!

200
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,250
--Oh wow!
--How lovely.

201
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,250
Oh yeah.

202
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,920
[LUFFY] It's super big
and super cool!

203
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,155
It looks ready to break stuff!

204
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,657
Aah! And it's really free?

205
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,026
Huh.

206
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,094
It's gotta be
twice as big as Merry.

207
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,597
Wait, is the sail
a sloop? It's huge!

208
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,167
Show me the kitchen, hurry!
I wanna see!

209
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,101
I love the figurehead!

210
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,070
[ROBIN] What kind of flower
is it supposed to be?

211
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,240
[ICEBERG] Mwell, I think
he intended it to be a lion.

212
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,109
[LUFFY] The inside
is awesome, too!

213
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,911
And the deck has
a lawn! It's so soft!

214
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,913
[CHOPPER] There's a slide!

215
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,115
It might be nice to do
some gardening up here.

216
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,184
Good for a nap, too.

217
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,186
[SANJI] Quick!
Where's the kitchen?

218
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,621
[NAMI] It must have
great mobility

219
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,289
with a gaff sail of that size!

220
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,959
Yes, they call this kind
of ship a brigantine.

221
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,727
Brigantine ships are
square-rigged in the front

222
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,896
and have a gaff sail
in the back, like a sloop.

223
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,433
They're quite versatile if the
navigator is up to the task.

224
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,036
Hm. Sounds like
a challenge! I love it!

225
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,937
[NAMI] Time to
check out the interior.

226
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,206
[SANJI] Ooh! It's got
a fridge with a lock,

227
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,974
just like I always wanted!

228
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,578
And look at
this oven! It's huge!

229
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:52,279
Oh, you're the best, Franky!

230
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,648
You made all my
dreams come true!

231
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,883
Hey, Ice Pops.

232
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,219
This is cool and all,
but where did Franky go?

233
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,254
We gotta thank him for this!

234
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,256
I'm sorry,
but it would appear that

235
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,324
he doesn't want to see you.

236
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,326
Huh?

237
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,295
Straw Hat. You were going
to invite Franky

238
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:09,963
to be your shipwright,
weren't you?

239
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,799
Yep. Wouldn't have it
any other way.

240
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,868
Besides, this is
his ship after all--

241
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,770
he has to come.

242
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,839
Then that might be your problem.

243
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,341
[LUFFY] Y'mean he
doesn't wanna join?

244
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:21,808
[ICEBERG] Just the opposite.

245
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,945
Rather, if you invited him
he wouldn't be able to refuse.

246
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,214
That's why he's
hiding right now.

247
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,350
Mwell, what I'm saying...

248
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,653
is that he wants to
join you in his heart.

249
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,255
[ICEBERG] Of course, you can
probably see that for yourself,

250
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:38,258
looking at all the love and care
he put into building this ship.

251
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,759
[CHOPPER] Whoa! Check it out!

252
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,428
There's an aquarium
in here, too!

253
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,597
[NAMI]
Oh, wow! It's beautiful!

254
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:45,966
And he's quite
fond of your crew,

255
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,135
so please don't blame
yourself for this.

256
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,570
[ICEBERG] But he
believes it's his duty

257
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,671
to stay on this island.

258
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,274
His bond has become
the chain that binds him.

259
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,341
Yeah?

260
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,277
Yes. Though if you ask me,
I think he's being

261
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,613
needlessly
stubborn over nothing.

262
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,248
Still, that's how he feels.

263
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,749
[ICEBERG]
So trying to reason with him

264
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,852
would be a waste of time.

265
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,087
If you really
want him to go with you,

266
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,223
then your only choice
is to use force.

267
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,325
Since he's not willing
to break that chain,

268
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,393
[ICEBERG] you'll have to
do it for him!

269
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,629
Use force?

270
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,964
And after he was so nice to us.

271
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,567
[LUFFY] Well, I guess
I can give it a shot.

272
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,174
C'mon, we gotta see
Big Bro off with

273
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,243
smiles on our faces! No crying!

274
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,345
I keep telling
the tears to stop man,

275
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,614
but I--I don't think
I can do it, no matter--hey!

276
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,249
[FRANKY FAMILY] Huh?

277
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,087
[FRANKY FAMILY gasps]

278
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,955
Bro, what the heck
are you doing here?

279
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,023
[FRANKY] Huh?

280
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,725
Why wouldn't I
be here, dumbass?

281
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,728
This is the Franky House,
right? I live here.

282
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,563
Yeah, but--

283
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,900
Are you sure about
what you're doing, Big Bro?

284
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,369
I mean you--you wanna
sail with the Straw Hats

285
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,204
on that ship
you built, don'tcha?

286
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:00,874
[FRANKY] Huh? What kinda
stupid question is that?

287
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,077
Of course not.

288
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,979
[FRANKY] Heh. Besides,
look at this mess.

289
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,981
What would you do without
me when you lug-heads

290
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,883
can't even build a house right?

291
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,151
Don't say that!

292
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,720
We just got back from
begging the Straw Hats

293
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:14,054
to take you with them!

294
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,523
Even if it'll be tough
without you, you gotta go!

295
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,059
[grunts]

296
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,695
You damn fools!
Mind your own business!

297
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,597
But! They want you to go, too!

298
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,399
The Straw Hat Crew
needs a shipwright!

299
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,900
You can't just turn them down!

300
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,069
Gimme one reason why
I should become a pirate

301
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,370
after all we've been through!

302
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,873
I can tell just by
looking at'chya.

303
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,675
[ZAMBAI] I mean,
you shoulda seen yourself

304
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,276
building that ship, bro.

305
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,379
In all the time
we've been together,

306
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:41,949
I've never seen you
smile like that even once.

307
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,884
You were like a new man.

308
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,254
You were doing what
you were meant to do.

309
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,055
Big Bro.

310
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,592
You knew the Straw Hats
were gonna ask you

311
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,194
to be their shipwright
before they left, didn't you?

312
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,730
That's why you
ran away, isn't it?

313
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,967
But thanks to this,
it doesn't matter anyway!

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,335
Shoulda known.

315
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:03,337
Guess it was only
a matter of time.

316
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,739
Even if you wanted, you
couldn't stay with us anymore!

317
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,175
And even if you don't think
we can make it without you,

318
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,410
we don't wanna drag you down!

319
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,565
But thanks to this,
it doesn't matter anyway!

320
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,966
Shoulda known.

321
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,668
Guess it was only
a matter of time.

322
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,170
Even if you wanted, you
couldn't stay with us anymore!

323
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,239
And even if you don't think
we can make it without you,

324
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,774
we don't wanna drag you down!

325
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,210
You cowards are just
scared of the Navy, aren't you?

326
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,479
I bet you're trying to
get rid of me, huh?

327
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,114
[FRANKY FAMILY sighs]

328
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,149
Maybe you forgot already,
but you people were

329
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,218
dying in a ditch
before I picked you up

330
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,586
and made you what you are today!

331
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,087
[ZAMBAI] Come on,
bro, don't be cruel.

332
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,256
Of course we
know that. But still!

333
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,158
If I'm not here,
you guys'll probably

334
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,827
starve to death in a week!

335
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,394
[yells]

336
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,198
I got his undies!

337
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,767
Whoa! He took his swim briefs!

338
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,001
Yes! Brilliant!

339
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:08,869
Don't lose 'em!

340
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,071
Pass 'em here!

341
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,739
Take the undies and run!

342
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,474
Gimme back my briefs!

343
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:15,108
[FRANKY FAMILY gasps]

344
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,876
[yells]

345
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,845
That's the only
pair of those I got!

[FRANKY FAMILY SILVERHAIR]
Everyone scatter! Let's go!

347
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:26,387
Have it your way! [grunts]

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,255
[FRANKY 321A]
He's coming after us!

349
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:30,424
You bastards think
I need undies to beat you?

350
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,460
I can take you down
stark naked if I have ta!

351
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,362
Only one of us
needs to survive!

352
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,998
We gotta make it to
Scrap Island no matter what!

353
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:40,801
[ZAMBAI] Get those
undies to Straw Hat!

354

[distant scream]

356
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,742
[FRANKY] Strong Right!

357
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,817
[FRANKY] Gimme back my briefs!

358
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,953
Too bad, bro.
They're long gone now.

359
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:01,488
Damn it, I saw 'em!

360
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,290
Don't you dare
play dumb with me!

361
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,859
[FRANKY 321B] Over here!
Hurry! Pass 'em!

362
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,695
Crap! A fakeout!

363
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,730
[FRANKY grunting]

364
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:13,166
Keep heading south and
don't look back! We got this!

365
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,944
Huh? What's with
all the ruckus?

366
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,312
[GENTLEMAN 321A panting]

367
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,815
There--there's a pervert!

368
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,750
Franky's running wild
and pantsless!

369
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:33,654
Again?

370
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,423
No! He'll destroy the city!

[commotion]

372
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,697
That's disgusting!

[screams]

374
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,369
I'll kick your ass
naked if I have ta!

375
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,705
He's even more
indecent than usual!

Hurry, get the children inside!

379
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,955
Don't let them see the pervert!

380
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,257
[FRANKY] Strong Right!

381
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,059
[FRANKY FAMILY groans]

[FRANKY grunts]

383
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,148
You're under arrest
for public indecency!

384
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,616
Surrender immediately!

385
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,150
[FRANKY] Huh?

386
00:18:45,726 --> 00:18:48,695
[yelps]

387
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:55,803
You... can't give up...

[FRANKY FAMILY SPLITHEAD]
The Yagara's ready to go!

391
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,009
Good! Move it!

392
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,744

[FRANKY FAMILY BALDY yells]

394
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:16,056
[FRANKY 321J] The backstreets
have turned into a battlefield!

[FRANKY FAMILY
SILVERHAIR groans]

396
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:23,229
My legs. So tired.
I'm done for!

Hey! Pass 'em to me! Hurry!

Up here!

400
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,577
It's Straw Hat!

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,979
Don't you dare!

402
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,614
[yells]

403
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,854
[LUFFY] Let's see
where they go next!

404
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,655
[FRANKY] Little turd!

405
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,991
Come back here!

[CITIZENS groaning]

407
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,729
So, how'd you like the ship?

408
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,330
It's awesome! [chuckles]

409
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,566
In fact, I think it's the
coolest ship I've ever seen!

410
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,968
Thanks a lot!

411
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,537
Aah! My innocent eyes
have been tainted!

412
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,271
Stop him!

413
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,273
Throw that freak in jail!

414
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,141
Damn straight it's awesome!

415
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,944
It was made from my
super blueprints after all!

416
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,446
I included all of your requests,

417
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,081
and hooked it up
with my one-of-a-kind

418
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,482
Soldier Dock System.

419
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,551
Have you had
the chance to try it?

420
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,621
Sorry, but not yet!

421
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:24,057
[FRANKY] Well just you wait,
'cause it's gonna blow you away!

422
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,026
[FRANKY]
What about the fish tank?

423
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,394
[LUFFY] Love it!

424
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,296
If you catch fish and
dump 'em in the tank up top,

425
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,864
you'll be able to
see them swim around

426
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,699
in the room below.
It's an aquarium

427
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,234
and a dining room all in one!

428
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,436
The whole crew can meet
down there for a fancy dinner

429
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,140
and you know you'll always
have fresh fish to pick from!

430
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,141
Looking forward to it!

431
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,211
Just like I promised,

432
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,147
it's the best damn ship
that a man can build!

433
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,215
[FRANKY] A ship of dreams,
for both of us!

434
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,718
Now give me back my briefs...

435
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,454
or I'll blow you to smithereens!

00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,624

437
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:58,592

00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:05,633
Look, here he comes!

00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,601
We're counting on
you two for this one!

441
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,202
[ZORO] No problem!

442
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:13,507
Huh?

443
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,809

00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:21,281
Ready? Aim for
Scrap Island!

446
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,916
What the hell
are you trying to do?!

Hey! Cut it out!
This has gone on long enough!

[FRANKY screams]

451
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,969
Hey! Aren't we supposed to
send his undies there first?

452
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,471
[LUFFY] Grab on, Chopper!

453
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,473
Huh?

454
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:49,743
Now, Gum-Gum... Rocket!

455
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,311
[CHOPPER screams]

456
00:21:51,878 --> 00:22:02,055
[distant murmurs]

457
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,592
Franky was flying!

458
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,059
Heaven is punishing us!

459
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,328
Careful! He could
get up and go wild!

460
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:09,496
Ooh!

461
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:12,899

[laughs]

465
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:24,311
Mwell... This certainly
took an interesting turn.

466
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,082
[FRANKY] Aah...

467
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:35,722
[LUFFY] Franky!

468
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:37,290
Huh?

469
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,996
Thanks, the ship is great!

470
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,965
Just like you said,
it's the best!

471
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,300
We'll take good care of it!

472
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:50,904
Heh. Yeah!
I had fun with you guys!

473
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,773
Have a safe trip!

474
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:54,074
[LUFFY] Oh, I hate to
break it to you,

475
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,010
but if you want
your undies back,

476
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:59,279
then you're gonna
have to join our crew!

477
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,285
[growls]

478
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,395
[FRANKY] I was sure you guys
were useless without me,

479
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,165
but you really pulled
one over on me this time.

480
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:20,201
What am I supposed to do now?

481
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,401
No matter what you say,

482
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,270
this town is
still special to me,

483
00:23:23,304 --> 00:23:25,706
and you guys are, too! I--

484
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,041
[FRANKY sobbing]

485
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,576
[LUFFY] On the next One Piece:

486
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:33,213
Goodbye My Dear Underlings!
