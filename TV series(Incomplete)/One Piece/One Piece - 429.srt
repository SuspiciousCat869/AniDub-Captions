00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,741
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,710
A countless array of
pirates go to battle

39
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,946
across the seas in
search of the One Piece,

40
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,848
the legendary
treasure left behind

41
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,684
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

42
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,553
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

43
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,055
after eating
the Gum-Gum Fruit,

44
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,858
sets sail to become the next
King of the Pirates.

45
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:58,027
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles

46
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,562
they capture the
unwanted attention

47
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,930
of the World Government,

48
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:05,401
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

49
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,604
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

50
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:11,040
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

51
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:14,410
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

52
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,612
the crew will cut a path

53
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,982
across the Grand Line
to the New World!

54
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:23,920
[NARRATOR]
Luffy fell captive

55
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,623
to the strange Net-Net
powers of Largo,

56
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,925
the captain of
the Amigo Pirates.

57
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,527
[LUFFY groans]

58
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,529
While I admire
your elastic nature,

59
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,099
I'm afraid you must pay
your comeuppance, senor!

60
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,867
[NARRATOR]
But Largo's true target

61
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,535
was the giant beetle, Boss,

62
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,970
who surrendered himself

63
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:45,008
in an attempt to save
his home from the pirates.

64
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,043
[LUFFY]
Hold on!

65
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,811
[LUFFY yells]

66
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,446
I know you can hear me!

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,981
[YOKO gasps]

68
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,419
[LUFFY pants]

69
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:58,988
[NARRATOR]
Boss then shed his skin,

70
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,959
destroying the nets holding
Luffy and his friends.

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,994
[BOSS growls]

72
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,100
[LUFFY yells]

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,036
[grunts]

74
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,576
This is awful!

75
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,612
It must've been too
soon for him to molt!

76
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:25,782
Your screaming and crying
won't do any good.

77
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:27,884
No one's gonna save
you whining peasants

78
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,953
now that we got
your guardian angel.

79
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,688
[LUFFY]
The fight's not over yet.

80
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,689
--[COLT] Hmm?
--[LARGO] Que?

81
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,657
[LUFFY] You didn't risk
your life for nothing.

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,592
We'll save your friends, Boss.

83
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,027
We owe you that much.

84
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:40,029
Leave everything to us!

85
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,431
Well...

86
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,699
The fun's over.

87
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,600
It's time to get serious.

88
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,572
[LUFFY] "A Special Presentation
Related to the Movie!

89
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,642
Luffy vs. Largo!
The Battle is On!"

90
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,517
[VILLAGERS talking]

91
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:03,953
[LARGO]
Hmm...

92
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,621
You're joking!

93
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,623
You need me to spell
out the odds for you?

94
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:09,425
[COLT]
Three burned men and a handful

95
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,462
of weak sea cowards
with shovels and rakes.

96
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,963
Do you really think
you're gonna take

97
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:15,798
the beetle back from us now?

98
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:19,569
That's right.

99
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:21,604
Now fork over Boss!

100
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,072
Or else!

101
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,141
[ALL]
We want him back!

102
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:31,814
[VILLAGERS yelling]

103
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,882
Thank you.

104
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,051
[COLT laughing]

105
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,553
Come on! Let's see
what you punks've got.

106
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,689
Zoro, cut the net open.

107
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:40,690
[ZORO]
Sure.

108
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:43,593
Did the beetle burn out
your short term memory?

109
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,228
No matter how sharp
your blades may be,

110
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,897
they're still not strong
enough to cut through my nets.

111
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,632
Don't speak so soon.

112
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,637
Wait for it.

113
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,172
Lion Strike!

114
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,877
Ay!

115
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:03,079
[VILLAGER 429A]
We're a part of this fight too!

116
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,113
[VILLAGERS]
Yeah!

117
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,215
Don't be stupid!

118
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,784
Huh?

119
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,121
[LUFFY]
Alright. Second Gear!

120
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,658
Sanji, I need a boost.
You know where I'm goin'.

121
00:06:15,691 --> 00:06:17,193
You got it.

122
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,728
Okay, net man.

123
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,762
You're goin' down.

124

Am I? Such confidence.

[SANJI, ZORO]
No problem.

130
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,648
[COLT] Did he take
out big bro that easy?

131
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,582
No.

132
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,117
He just caught him off guard.

133
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,553
Largo's sure to beat
that little punk.

134
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:45,254
At least he better
if he wants us

135
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,024
to get in with
Big Boss Shiki.

136
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:55,965
[LUFFY] That hurt enough for ya,
or you want some more?

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,168
Well, that jogged my memory.

138
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,736
[LARGO]
I know that hat of yours.

139
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,737
[LUFFY gasps]

140
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:04,707
[LARGO] You have a
300 million berry bounty.

141
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,710
You are Monkey D. Luffy, si?

142
00:07:07,743 --> 00:07:09,545
Yeah. That's me.

143
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:13,149
It's a tragedy to end one's
life at such a young age.

144
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,618
But I couldn't
lament your lost life.

145
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,654
Compared to the loss
of such a bounty.

146
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,690
Mucho. Burning. Net!

147
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,629
[LUFFY]
Now Gum-Gum. Jet. Lance!

148

[LARGO]
Mucho Sticky Net!

149
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,337
[LARGO]
This is no bueno.

150
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,174
I need to find some open
terrain to fight him on!

151
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,076
He's running!

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,256
[laughing]
Your backup's gone.

153
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,225
Not surprising, since
they're from the East Blue.

154
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:57,260
Guess the rumors are true,

155
00:07:57,293 --> 00:08:00,663
they don't call it
the "weak sea" for nothing.

156
00:08:00,696 --> 00:08:01,531
No.

157
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,965
They took off
because it was obvious

158
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,301
that we didn't
need any backup.

159
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,137
They knew two East Blue
natives are more than enough.

160
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:10,039
[LUIGIA]
Slow down! Stop running!

161
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,009
Take us back, we were about
to kick their pirate butts!

162
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,777
You sound like
a damn fool!

163
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,647
You can't just confront 'em
head on like that. It's suicide!

164
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,581
[NAMI]
Exactly!

165
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:19,782
You can't fight them
on their own terms,

166
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,218
you've gotta work with your
strengths if you wanna win.

167
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,054
Which means outsmarting them.

168
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,356
[YOKO panting]

169
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,159
[NAMI]
C'mon! We need to hurry!

170
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,862
Hey! Don't tell me
what to do, you dumb pirate!

171
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,830
[NAMI sighs]

172
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:40,937
Listen, kid.

173
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,838
Do you want them
to destroy the island

174
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:43,906
and take the beetle?

175
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,007
[YOKO gasps]

176
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,276
You've gotta trust me if
you don't want them to win.

177
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,747
[YOKO]
Do you promise?

178
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,416
[NAMI]
Huh?

179
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,384
If I trust you and go
along with your plan,

180
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:58,287
do you promise me
I'll get Boss back?

181
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,189
Yeah.

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,697
So, are you ready?

183
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,098
Hmm.

184
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,900
[NAMI]
Well, let's do it!

185
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,301
[VILLAGERS]
Yeah!

186
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,321
[YOKO, NAMI]
Hmm.

187
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,621
[COLT] You really think
the two of you are enough?

188
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:26,324
Your delusions are
as big as your mouth!

189
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,026
They outnumber us,
but that's all they've got.

190
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,696
If you're scared, you can
always sit this one out.

191
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,331
[SANJI] First I'm gonna
kick their asses,

192
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,566
and then I'm gonna kick yours.

193
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,837
Alright, you guys.

194
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,371
Let's--

197

What the hell?

198
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,646
You mess with us and you die!

199
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,981
Run, you cowards.

200
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:51,315
[AMIGO PIRATE yelps]

201
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:53,284
--We don't want you here!
--Get off of our island!

202
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:55,353

they come from?

203
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,821

Take that!

[YOKO grunts]

206
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:05,296
[NAMI laughs]
Surprised to see us?

207
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:06,964
[NAMI] There's a giant
network of caves

208
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,933
hidden inside the
mountain back there.

209
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,167
And they open up

210
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,069
to all the different
parts of the island.

211
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:14,772
Using it as an escape route
felt like kind of a waste,

212
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:17,808
so I thought we could stage
a little surprise ambush!

213
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:20,244
Take cover guys,
we've got a storm coming!

What have you
done to mi hermano?

As a requiem
for my beloved kin,

250
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,043
I'll kill your crew.

Captain first.

252
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,379
[LARGO] Now that we've
traded the confines

of the jungle for open spaces,
you'll surely perish.

00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,019
I'm pretty sure I can
kick your ass anywhere.

Bring it!

00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,490

plan to keep it up?

that are rather vague!

What're you doing here?

00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,386
I heard there was
an orange plantation.

00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,934
My dad used to come out
here all the time.

We both did.

351
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,141
Isn't the view just lovely?

352
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:09,845
There's no place in the world
I like better than this one!

It's so pretty,
I love it up here!

really love it!

00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:22,357
[PIRATES laughing]
Let's burn it down!

358
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:24,359
[PIRATE 1] Gather up any food
and valuables you can find!

359
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,462
[PIRATE 2] Kill anyone
who tries to get in our way!

360
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:29,965
[YOKO]
Dad! Wake up!

361
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:33,535
[YOKO'S DAD grunts]
Yoko. Hurry!

362
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,971
You must leave the island.

363
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,006
No way! I can't!

364
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,109
I love it here too much to go!

365
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,977
If I leave, I'll never
be able to visit

366
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,513
my favorite place in
the world again!

367
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,282
It's your favorite
place too, remember?

368
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,318
With all the orange trees?

369
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:54,256
[YOKO crying]

370
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,059
[YOKO'S DAD]
You're right, Yoko.

371
00:17:57,092 --> 00:17:58,393
[YOKO]
Huh?

372
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:02,464
[YOKO'S DAD grunts]

373
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,405
[YOKO'S DAD]
From now on...

374
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:13,242
...it's your island.

375
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:17,980
[YOKO crying]
No. Dad!

376
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,915
[YOKO'S DAD]
Protect your home.

377
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:23,285
Be strong and brave.

378
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,993
[NAMI]
We're a lot alike.

379
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,060
[YOKO]
Huh?

380
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:33,462
[NAMI]
I used to hate pirates

381
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,164
just as much as you.

382
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,001
[YOKO] Yeah? But then,
why did you become one?

383
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,204
Well... it's kinda
hard to explain.

384
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:53,315
[gunshot]

385
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,291
[NAMI crying]

386
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,064
[LUFFY]
Nami!

387
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:10,566
Just remember!

388
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:13,468
You'll always be my friend!

389
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:17,506
[NAMI crying]

390
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:24,379
Ya know, Luffy's not the
kind of pirate you think.

391
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,048
Not in the slightest.

392
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,416
Huh?

393
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,120
[YOKO growls]

394
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:34,356
[LUFFY screams]

395
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,258
[LUFFY]
Listen.

396
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,994
I'll come back tomorrow
and we'll try again.

397
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:40,262
[BOSS roars]

398
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:41,563
[LUFFY laughs]

399
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,498
[LUFFY]
Shut up! Shut up!

400
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,701
I don't give a
damn about that!

401
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:48,670
All I want is to
fight that giant beetle!

402
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,606
[VILLAGERS]
Is that it?

403
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,374
[laughs]

404
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,710
Yeah, I think
I see what you mean.

405
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,178
You do?

406
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:57,746
Mmhmm.

407
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,148
I get the feeling he's
a little too dumb and goofy

408
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:02,451
to be one of the bad pirates.

409
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,219
[NAMI laughing]

410
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,121
Exactly.

411
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,291
It got quiet
all of a sudden.

412
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,093
Did they finally
finish their fight?

413
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,562
[YOKO]
Guess so.

414
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,597
Well, let's see how Boss did.

415
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,168
[LUFFY panting]

416
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,104
So? You give up?

417
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,240
[BOSS grunts]

418
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:26,575
[CHOPPER]
He said no way.

419
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,610
And he said that he won, too.

420
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,511
[LUFFY]
What?

421
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,813
[BOSS growls]

422
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:32,781
[NAMI]
Alright, break it up!

423
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,751
It's time for us to
head back out to sea!

424
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,186
Ah! You can't be serious, Nami!

425
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,655
We've got ten
rounds left, at least!

426
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:40,889
C'mon.

427
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:44,092
It only takes half of a day for
this island to log to reset.

428
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,695
So we'd better take off unless
we wanna get stranded.

429
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,729
Aw!

430
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,464
[BOSS groans]

431
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:01,076
[ALL]
Farewell, Nami!

432
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,263
[BOSS grunting]

433
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,266
[YOKO]
Luffy!

434
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,102
Thanks for saving our island!

435
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,571
Sorry I was a jerk!

436
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,807
[LUFFY laughs]
No problem at all!

437
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,875
[YOKO laughs]

438
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,111
[BOSS grunts]

439
00:21:36,144 --> 00:21:37,546
Listen up, big guy!

440
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,182
I'm gonna be comin'
back here someday.

441
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,250
And we're pickin' up
where we left off!

442
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,421
The fight's not over yet!

443
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:22,657
[SHIKI] I thought
these Amigo Pirates

444
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,694
claimed to be
specialists in trapping?

445
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:26,828
[SHIKI PIRATE 429A]
Maybe they are.

446
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,430
But we've lost
contact with them

447
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,898
so we can only
assume the worst.

448
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,133
Oh well.

449
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,902
On the bright side, at least
we have some added reassurance

450
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,439
that the monsters you
created are up to snuff.

451
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:40,675
We can live without
one giant beetle.

452
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:44,813
It won't affect my plans.

453
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:49,384
After all, I have plenty
more bloodthirsty beasties

454
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,220
to do my bidding in its absence.

455
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:53,588
We'll declare war

456
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,224
against the whole
damn world!

457
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:57,626
No one can stop me!

458
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,896
The Golden Lion
will reign supreme!

459
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,800
[laughing]

460
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,278
[NARRATOR] Luffy and
his unlikely companions

461
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,513
defeat the basilisk and
race through Level 2

462
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,483
only to encounter even
more ferocious beasts.

463
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,851
Meanwhile, Ace finds himself

464
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:24,719
with an unlikely
companion as well

465
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:28,423
when he exchanges words with
a powerful pirate prisoner.

466
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:29,558
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece,

467
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:33,595
"A Warlord in Prison!
Jimbei, The Honorable Pirate."

468
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:35,964
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
