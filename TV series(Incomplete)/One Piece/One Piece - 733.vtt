00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.631
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.069
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.443
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:53.346
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.752
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.456
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.866
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.503
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:08.276
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.552
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.096
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:21.670
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.610
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.214
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:31.322
[NARRATOR] In one harrowing
battle after another,

00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:32.792
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeat

00:03:32.892 --> 00:03:35.565
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:38.804
Meanwhile the razor-sharp
threads of Doflamingo's Birdcage

00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:41.877
threaten to massacre
everyone in the kingdom.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:46.119
Now, the final countdown begins
and Luffy must finish Doflamingo

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.959
before the kingdom and everyone
in it is torn to shreds.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.668
We stopped it once, didn't we?

00:03:53.768 --> 00:03:55.403
We'll do it again,
if we have to!

00:03:55.504 --> 00:03:58.510

Keep pushing! Let's go!

00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:11.035
Thanks to your hard work,
the Birdcage was slowed down,

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:13.807
and countless lives were saved!

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:17.715
And soon enough,
the coliseum's shining star,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:20.922
our Lucy, will take the stage!

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:25.464
Let's show him how we feel
and give the man a cheer!

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.938
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:33.447
For Mister Luffy! Let's go!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:42.598
I can't... I can't stop it!

00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:47.073
Very good. Now kill Violet.

00:04:47.173 --> 00:04:50.548
No!

00:04:54.623 --> 00:04:56.226
I'm sorry, Viola!

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:58.931
Quick, Rebecca! Close your eyes!

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.402
I'll forgive you!

00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:03.740
All that matters
is that you move on!

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:05.878
Please, be happy!

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.615
[chuckles]

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:11.322
Stop it!

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:15.363
Don't be upset.
It's not your fault!

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:17.535
I'm sorry I have to
leave you like this.

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:18.938
I know it will hurt.

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:21.643
I know it won't be
easy to overcome.

00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:29.826
[REBECCA]
No!

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:33.667

[LUFFY yells]

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:10.106
[GYATS] It's our champion!
Lucy is here at last!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:18.156

Finally. Finally!

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.571
Lucy is back!

[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:15.604
All right, we're waiting, Lucy!

00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:19.946
Time to knock him out
in one shot!

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:24.154
[DOFLAMINGO] This is all
rather dramatic, isn't it?

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:28.162
But still. I imagine it took a
lot just to recover your Haki.

00:07:28.263 --> 00:07:30.267
[panting]

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.204
[DOFLAMINGO]
Why, it's probably a struggle

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:34.007
for you just to stand.

00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:42.892
Maybe. But you're no better off.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:50.874
[gasps] Lucy!

00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:57.722

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:05.871
[panting]

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:06.973
Huh?

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:13.654
[panting]

00:08:13.754 --> 00:08:16.693
Huh. That's where you
crawled off to.

00:08:18.095 --> 00:08:21.135
[DOFLAMINGO] Perfect.
You've got front row seats.

00:08:21.503 --> 00:08:25.544
Now watch as I crush
the only hope you've got left.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.864
Time for Everwhite!

00:08:39.939 --> 00:08:43.747
Huh? He turned the whole
block into strings!

00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.591
Lucy!

00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:51.362
[gasps] Damn you!

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:55.169
[chuckles] It's no use.

00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.981

00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:30.608
Done already?

00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:32.711
What about your comeback, huh?

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:41.930
I'm not seeing that
miraculous Haki of yours, Lucy!

00:09:45.604 --> 00:09:47.842
Is he gonna be okay?

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:07.080
[ALL gasp]

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:17.668
Oh no!

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:27.588
He's done for.

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:31.228
I suppose his injuries
were too severe.

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:34.903
[TOWNSPEOPLE murmuring]

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:36.607
That didn't look good.

00:10:36.707 --> 00:10:38.643
It's still too dusty to see.

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.681
So is the fight
over already, or what?

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.118
Did Lucy win? I can't tell.

00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:47.060
The Birdcage is still here.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.398
Lucy! Hurry!

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:50.735
He's got this!

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:52.539
Let's keep the faith
a little longer!

00:11:33.219 --> 00:11:35.691
[LUFFY]
Wh-What the hell?

00:11:36.058 --> 00:11:39.264
My body's moving on its own!

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:54.863
[chuckles] You're my puppet now.

00:11:54.963 --> 00:11:56.331
Good luck defeating me

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:58.435
when you can't even
control your own limbs.

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:02.076
[DOFLAMINGO]
Now march.

00:12:04.815 --> 00:12:07.788
[DOFLAMINGO] I can't believe you
survived that last assault.

00:12:07.888 --> 00:12:10.460
I'll have to impale you
properly next time.

00:12:10.561 --> 00:12:11.896
Or maybe I should force you

00:12:11.996 --> 00:12:13.933
to kill all of your
friends, instead.

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:24.321
[RAYLEIGH laughs]
Came running back

00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:26.759
with your tail
between your legs?

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:30.367
Well, you escaped
death again, that's good.

00:12:30.467 --> 00:12:33.339
Next time, I'm gonna win!
[chomps]

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:35.711
[RAYLEIGH] Your famous
"Kong Gun" didn't do the trick?

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.815
This guy was huge!

00:12:37.915 --> 00:12:39.217
Way bigger than the last one,

00:12:39.317 --> 00:12:41.188
so the move
didn't work, Rayleigh!

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:42.625
It wasn't fair!

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:46.532
[RAYLEIGH laughs] Sounds like
you're in trouble, then!

00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:52.344
Oh well. If the
Kong Gun doesn't work,

00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:54.882
then you'll just have to
come up with something else.

00:12:55.784 --> 00:12:57.855
I guess. But what?

00:13:01.395 --> 00:13:05.036
[LUFFY] The Kong Gun wasn't
enough for Mingo, either.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.003
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
It's almost tragic.

00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:24.474
All those little insects
were so much better off,

00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:27.781
dancing on their strings,
trapped in my cage,

00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:29.050
as they were meant to be.

00:13:31.956 --> 00:13:35.196
[LUFFY] "Insects"?
That's what you think?

00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:37.602
[DOFLAMINGO]
Of course.

00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:39.872
Humans are nothing but garbage.

00:13:39.972 --> 00:13:42.310
The people here only
had worth because I,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.851
with my divine will,
controlled them.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:50.159
For mere insects,
I'd say that's quite an honor.

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.333
[DOFLAMINGO]
But like a bunch of fools,

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.071
you burst in and
cut those strings,

00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:59.110
and this is the
natural conclusion.

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:03.119
If you hadn't trifled with
my perfectly prosperous kingdom,

00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:05.122
then I wouldn't have been
forced to massacre

00:14:05.222 --> 00:14:07.193
all of its inhabitants.

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:13.205
Just shut up!

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:17.447

Hmph. Go ahead.

Turn into your stupid
balloon man thing.

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.929
That'll be more fun for me.

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:49.732
I'll have you kill
all your friends,

00:15:49.832 --> 00:15:52.704
then kill everyone else in the
kingdom, while you're at it.

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.740
All right. Fourth Gear!

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.171
You can't have much
strength remaining.

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.643
How long do you think
you can last in that form?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.055
This is it.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.803
Sure you want to challenge
someone like me in the air?

00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:43.305
You've got some nerve!

00:16:54.328 --> 00:16:57.266
Ha. Still beating me in one hit?

00:16:57.366 --> 00:16:59.304
Let's see it, then!

[LUFFY panting]

00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:20.947
[DOFLAMINGO chuckles]
I don't know if I like

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.187
Well, no matter.

drag you to the ground

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:27.794
and make you my puppet again.

whatever you want
and strangle it!

You can't have everything!

00:17:57.621 --> 00:18:00.392
You can't control
everyone, either!

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:20.232
Seeing you makes it
hard to even breathe!

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:21.803
That's not my fault!

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:23.439
Blame your fate.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.646
To be born as a human
is to be born as living trash!

00:18:26.913 --> 00:18:30.419
It's my divine right
to control you as I please!

00:18:30.521 --> 00:18:32.156

I'm gonna kick your ass.

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:34.629
Then everyone here will be free!

They'll be able to
breathe again!

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:40.640
Kick my ass, then! Try it!

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.678
Spiderweb!

00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:51.028
[RAYLEIGH] Oh well.
If the Kong Gun doesn't work,

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:53.733
then you'll just have to
come up with something else.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:56.204
Now, Gum-Gum...

00:19:00.412 --> 00:19:01.916
[LUFFY]
I guess. But what?

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.987
Something different.

00:19:04.087 --> 00:19:06.659
Fourth Gear is indeed strong,

00:19:06.759 --> 00:19:09.531
but I'm afraid it taxes
your body too much.

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:13.305
'Kay! Then how about this?

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:18.181
[RAYLEIGH]
What? No!

00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:19.752
That would be
even harder on you!

00:19:19.853 --> 00:19:22.189
[chuckles]

00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:34.414
All right. King Kong...

00:19:43.332 --> 00:19:46.237
All those who won't
obey me must die.

00:19:46.337 --> 00:19:49.511
My Sixteen Holy Bullets
shall be your trial!

00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:57.727
[DOFLAMINGO]
God Thread!

00:19:59.063 --> 00:20:01.802
[yells]

00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:04.575
...Gun!

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:29.725
[LUFFY yelling]

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:36.238
[yelling]

00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:37.975
Lucy!

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:41.448
[TOWNSMAN F] You got this,
Lucy! Take him down!

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.464
[yelling]

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:53.773
When I'm done,
nothing will remain!

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:06.031
[grunts]

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.536
[DOFLAMINGO cackles]

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:13.847
Mister Luffy!

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:14.715
Luffy!

00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:15.984
Luffyland!

00:21:16.085 --> 00:21:17.419
Straw Hat!

00:21:19.024 --> 00:21:19.992
Luffy!

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:20.961
Luffy!

00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:22.363
Fight, Sir Luffy!

00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:23.833
And prevail!

00:21:25.136 --> 00:21:26.038
Luffy!

00:21:26.138 --> 00:21:27.072
This is it!

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:30.547
Fight, Lucy!

00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:39.798
[yelling]

00:22:35.878 --> 00:22:37.547
[ROSINANTE] Those who fear
the inheritors of D.

00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:39.718
have given them another title.

00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:43.124
[ROSINANTE]
"Sworn enemy of gods"!

00:23:00.894 --> 00:23:05.737
[panting]

00:23:14.153 --> 00:23:15.523
[NARRATOR]
With the end of the battle,

00:23:15.623 --> 00:23:17.695
a new era dawns in Dressrosa.

00:23:17.795 --> 00:23:19.397
As the citizens
and Luffy's allies

00:23:19.497 --> 00:23:21.602
watch the Birdcage
fade from the sky,

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:24.140
a flood of emotions
washes over the kingdom.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.946
But for all who have been freed
from this reign of terror,

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:30.620
a man they call "Lucy"
will forever be their champion.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.423
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:34.895
"To Be Free!
Dressrosa's Delight!"

00:23:34.995 --> 00:23:37.767
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
