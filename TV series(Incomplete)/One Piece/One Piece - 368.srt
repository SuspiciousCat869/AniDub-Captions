Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring outs

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

All the way to "One piece"!!

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390

them dyes your heart

Snatch up the treasure here and there

While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

[NARRATOR] Wealth, fame, power.

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,627
Gold Roger,
the King of the Pirates,

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,298
attained this and everything
else the world had to offer.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:50,336
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

41
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,439
[GOLD ROGER] You want my
treasure? You can have it!

42
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,776
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

Now you just have to find it!

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,649
[NARRATOR] These words lured

She's... She's so brutal!

It's like she's some kind of
crazy pirate demon woman!

75
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,521
Exactly what
the hell is going on?

76
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,923
Do you want to explain
where the treasure is?

77
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,526
You're the one who should be
explaining things, pirate woman!

78
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,461
Let me go! It's payback time!

You think you can take me?

There isn't anyone alive

that can stand
between me and my treasure.

00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,271
Anybody who so
much as touches it

And I know we said way too much.

How dare she try
to take my treasure!

00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,008
And she wants
to steal the Sunny,

97
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,678
load it up, and use
it as her getaway boat?

98
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,545
Sorry, sweetie.

It doesn't look like
everything else around here.

it's really well made.

dealing with that guy

00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,832
All that screaming sounds a lot

129
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,934
like it's coming from Oars!

00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,993
--Special Attack!
--Special Attack!

181
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,302
So after all that,
this is their attack.

182
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,970
I believe that's a "yes".

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,674
Dammit!

184
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,643
Docking Three totally sucks!

185
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,845
I'm embarrassed I had
anything to do with this crap!

186
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,247
That's not neat like last time.

187
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,982
You're stupid!

188
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,151
That's what we
want you to believe!

189
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,022
Now! Witness the true terror
of Pirates Docking Three!

190
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,224
Moron!

191
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,760
You think you've got what it
takes to be King of the Pirates?

192
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,095
You're all size and
brute strength, nothing more.

193
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,864
You're the world's tallest joke!

194
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,832
[FRANKY AND CHOPPER]
Moron! Moron!

195
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,001
What'd you call me?

196
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,170
Just a few pirates
knocked you flat,

197
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,171
and you think
you're gonna somehow

198
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,006
be the King of all of them?

199
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,742
Give up! You're nothing
but an embarrassment!

200
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,378
Yeah?

201
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm gonna "embarrassment" you!

202
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,016
Pipsqueak pirates!
I'll smash you flat!

203
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,251
[USOPP, CHOPPER AND FRANKY]
That's it! Jump!

204
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,190
[USOPP, CHOPPER AND FRANKY]
Yeah, we did it!

205
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,925
[OARS]
Owie, owie, owie!

206
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,427
[FRANKY] How does it feel
to knock yourself down

207
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,228
with your own punch?

208
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,897
Alright!

209
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,699
Robin, did ya see? Did ya see?

210
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,767
Everything went
just as I planned!

211
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,370
Way to go,
Pirates Docking Three!

212
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,272
Wow, you guys are the best!

213
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,208
[ZORO] Nobody's buying
that crap, stupid cook.

214
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,043
That's your second
time down, monster!

215
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,912
--Yeah! Two times!
--Yeah! Two times!

216
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,282
Whoa! I'm falling again!

217
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,220
[USOPP]
Run for it!

218
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,389
--Crap! He didn't fall!
--Crap! He didn't fall!

219
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,424
Damn! We were so close, too!

220
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,260
He's as stubborn as he is tall.

221
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,930
I don't have time for this.
I gotta save Nami!

222
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,064
Hang on a second.

223
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,233
I just got an idea
on how to stop him.

224
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,335
I've had enough of
these half-assed plans.

225
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,937
Listen to me, dammit!

226
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,073
[USOPP]
From what I've seen,

227
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,274
even though he's
big and red and all,

228
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,778
this guy still has traces of
Luffy's personality left in him.

229
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,846
[CHOPPER]
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,914
He already told us he
didn't recognize any of us

231
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,983
and that Moria was his master!

232
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,485
Yeah, but even so.

233
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,354
[FRANKY] What the hell
are you doing to us, Robin?

234
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,490
Hurry up and dock
onto my left arm!

235
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,191
[CHOPPER]
Robin! We need you!

236
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,128
[USOPP] Come on, it's fine!
Just do what I'm doing!

237
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,028
No.

238
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,964
I'm not embarrassing
myself like that.

239
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,770
Whassa matter?
She won't do it?

240
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,938
[SANJI] What, why are you
acting all disappointed?

241
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,440
Why ya think?

242
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,009
I want to see the robot!

243
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,112
Right at that moment,
his other half leaked out.

244
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,848
The part of him that's still
Luffy is in there somewhere.

245
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,150
See what I mean?

246
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,387
I think you're right.

247
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,223
Yeah. So how does that help us?

248
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,526
Well, it means that
this guy's weaknesses

249
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,995
are the same
as Luffy's weaknesses.

250
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,165
[USOPP]
Check it out!

251
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,333
Look! There's a
huge hunk 'a meat!

252
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,368
A hunk 'a meat?

253
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,804
Show me! Where is it?

254
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,805
[CHOPPER]
Yeah!

255
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,973
I see it! It looks yummy!

256
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,975
Gimme! I love meat!

257
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,146
[FRANKY]
Knee Crush!

258
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,352
[ZORO] Does halfway
down count as three?

259
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,554
Even if there were rules,

260
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,522
I don't think this
guy would follow them.

261
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,523
Alright!

262
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,259
He's down again after
a blow to the kneecaps!

263
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,163
[USOPP and CHOPPER cheering]

264
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,998
That was embarrassing.

265
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,433
Keep it up, you guys!

266
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,171
Just stall him 'til the captain
beats the crap outta Moria!

267
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,074
Hurry up and get those
shadows back, Straw Hat!

268
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,110
There's no reason to
keep screwing around like this.

269
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,846
Let's put him down for good.

270
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,849
[FRANKY]
Hold on!

271
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,017
I thought the idea was for us
to keep this big monster busy

272
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,186
to make sure he doesn't
get in Straw Hat's way!

273
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,422
There's no way we
can beat this thing, man!

274
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,557
There wasn't any meat.

275
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,460
You tricked me
and broke my kneecaps.

276
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,896
A fight isn't truly
over until you've won.

277
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,898
He's not just
a giant, he's a zombie!

278
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,633
To beat him,
you're gonna have to purify him!

279
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,534
That's right, Zoro!

280
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,536
We're just buying time!
Take it easy!

281
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,271
If you don't wanna help,
stand back.

282
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,140
I don't feel like waiting
around for Luffy to win, either.

283
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,408
You're crazy!

284
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,879
They've made up their minds,
there's no stopping them.

285
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,115
[OARS]
Now Gum-Gum...

286
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
[ZORO] A dinosaur
could step on this blade

287
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,322
and it wouldn't
bend a millimeter.

288
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,992
They say that hardness is
the greatest characteristic

289
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,493
of a Black Blade.

290
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,563
[RYUMA] The legendary
owner of this blade

291
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,902
may have long since fallen,
but its story does not end here.

292
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,639
With you as its master, this
sword will surely be satisfied.

293
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,143
[ZORO]
With Shusui here,

294
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,947
I've finally gotten my
hands on a first rate sword.

295
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,583
And I think this is the
perfect time to try it out.

296
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,484
Stop it!

297
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,652
Why you gotta be so stubborn?

298
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,795
Just let Luffy beat Moria!

299
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,746
Dammit!

300
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,048
Where'd that jerk go?

301
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,983
I'm sick of all
this running around!

302
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,256
I don't see him anywhere.

303
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,290
Hey, wait!

304
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,328
[LUFFY]
Gum Gum...

305
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,463
Rocket!

306
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,905
A-ha!

307
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,754
[NAMI]
Stop right there!

308
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,025
Who is that?
What does she want?

309
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,127
It's that pirate woman!

310
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,262
[NAMI]
What do you think you're doing

311
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,865
with all that treasure
I was gonna steal?

312
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,001
And what are you
doing onboard the Sunny?

313
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,104
Horo horo horo!

314
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,040
I was worried there for
a second, but it's only you.

315
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,275
How'd the wedding
ceremony with Absalom go?

316
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:51,210
Over already?

317
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,277
Oh, gimme a break!

318
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,045
Who would ever want to marry

319
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,214
that invisible
pervert beast-man?

320
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,816
Then I take it you
managed to escape the wedding.

321
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,885
Absalom can't do anything right.

322
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,022
So. What are you gonna do?

323
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,057
As you surmised,
I do plan on stealing your ship

324
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,358
to escape from Thriller Bark

325
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,328
and I'm bringing
all the treasure with me.

326
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
If you try to stop me,
I'll fight you.

327
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,465
And you won't like that.

328
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,339
You're not very strong,
so the Mini Hollow Ghost Army

329
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,908
will be more than
sufficient against you.

330
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,877
The only one among you
that put up a fight against me

331
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,179
was that depressing
long-nosed guy.

332
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,849
Who is that?

333
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,253
--Mistress Perona!
--Mistress Perona!

334
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,988
--Run! Don't look back!
--Run! Don't look back!

335
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,495
Just who in the hell are you?

336
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,599
We don't know him,
but he's definitely an enemy!

337
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,502
Just now he made some of our
brothers vanish without a trace

338
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,171
right before our very eyes!

339
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,539
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368A]
He's no ordinary man!

340
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,673
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368B]
He's dangerous!

341
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,408
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368C]
Whoever he is, he's bad news!

342
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,911
[NAMI thinking]
"Vanished"?

343
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,348
No, it can't be. I think...

344
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,250
I think I know who this man is!

345
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,026
[PERONA]
It's him.

346
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,897
One of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea.

347
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,633
"The Tyrant," Bartholomew Kuma.

348
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,203
The atrocities he committed
when he was a pirate

349
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,038
are beyond the pale.

350
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,274
[screaming]

00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,410
[ZOMBIE PANDA] One of the
Seven Warlords of the Sea?

352
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,448
Do you know what that means?

353
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,384
He's got the same
rank as Master Moria!

354
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,387
What's a guy like him
doing here on Thriller Bark?

355
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,123
[NAMI thinking]
You've gotta be kidding!

356
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,264
[KUMA]
Do you work for Moria?

357
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,299
[PERONA]
What? Master Moria?

358
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,168
I was, but I'm not anymore!

359
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,936
I've had enough of this!

360
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,906
I'm just trying to...
to escape from this island.

361
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,574
I want no part of it!

362
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,344
She's telling you the truth!

363
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,945
[ZOMBIE 368F]
That bastard!

364
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,082
What does he think he's
trying to do to Mistress Perona?

365
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,623
If you could take a vacation,

366
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,424
where is it you'd like to go?

367
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,429
He's making small talk?

368
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,099
This is not the time
or place for such nonsense!

369
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,603
But if I were
to go on a vacation,

370
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,006
somewhere dark and damp,

371
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,308
somewhere with an
old, creepy castle,

372
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,178
I'd spend every day there
singing a song of curses.

373
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,612
She answered!

374
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,181
That's the
Ghost Princess for you!

375
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,048
I agree!

376
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,651
We loved your answer,
Mistress Perona!

377
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,386
I got caught up in my daydream!

378
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,389
[PERONA]
Stop screwing around!

379
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,692
I admit, I was taken aback
when I realized who you were.

380
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,994
But I've got nothing to fear.

381
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,162
With my Devil Fruit powers,

382
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,664
there's no one
I can't take down,

383
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,332
and that includes you!

384
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,507
[PERONA]
Are you listening to me?

385
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,643
I'd imagine your shadow is
pretty strong, isn't it Kuma?

386
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,146
Good! Then I'll take it
from you as a parting gift

387
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,082
to my former master, Moria,
so prepare yourself!

388
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,586
[PERONA]
Negative Ghost!

389
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,356
And Special Hollow!

390
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,992
Alright! There it is!

391
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,528
Mistress Perona's
Ultimate Combo!

392
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,184
[KUMA] Before you interrupted
with all that yelling,

393
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,254
I was simply going to
ask you where Moria is.

394
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,690
Where did she go?

395
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,729
What happened
to Mistress Perona?

396
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,231
[ZOMBIES]
Mistress Perona!

397
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,733
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368F]
What was that? I'm scared!

398
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,068
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368G]
She disappeared! But how?

399
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,638
What did you do with
Mistress Perona, you bastard?

400
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,306
Unforgivable!

401
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,074
Where's our princess?

402
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,376
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368F]
You're gonna pay!

403
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,384
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368I]
He's scary!

404
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,219
[RANDOM ZOMBIE 368J]
Run for it!

405
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,800
You're the
Cat Burglar, aren't you?

406
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,735
One of the Straw Hat Pirates?

407
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,505
[KUMA] I've heard
that Monkey D. Luffy

408
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,307
has an older brother.

409
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,341
Is that true?

410
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,611
[NAMI]
Huh?

411
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,513
[NAMI thinking]
No way!

412
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,782
He just suddenly
appeared up there!

413
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,750
Did he teleport?

414
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,285
Yeah, he does!

415
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,820
You're talking about Ace, right?

416
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,591
Why do you wanna know?

417
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,161
I see.

418
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,263
So the rumors are true.

419
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,465
Yeah? So?
What's all this about?

420
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,633
What do you want?

421
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,201
Are you really a Warlord?

422
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,106
[KUMA] What I'm doing here
is none of your concern.

423
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,812
That guy is bad news.

424
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,880
What does he want with Luffy?

425
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,716
I've got to go warn him.

426
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,827
Gotcha, Moria!
You're mine!

427
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,200
You're not getting away
this time, you bastard!

428
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,868
I'm gonna beat
the crap outta you!

429
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,903
Give everyone's shadows back!

430
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,172
Now, Gum-Gum...

431
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,848
What?
I've been chasing his shadow?

432
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,821
[LUFFY]
Aw, dammit! He tricked me!

433
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:20,665
[MORIA]
Kushishi!

434
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,701
The morning sun will soon rise.

435
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,936
Careful! You will run
out of hiding places

436
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,405
if you dilly-dally.

437
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,773
[USOPP] Moria,
where are you hiding?

438
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,207
[MORIA]
Look carefully!

439
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,409
I'm right here.

440
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,109
[USOPP]
Now way!

441
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,445
Moria is inside Oars' stomach?!

442
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,414
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

443
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,515
"Oars + Moria.

444
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,551
The Most Heinous Combination
of Brains and Brawn.

445
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,354
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
