1
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:38,125
[NARRATOR]
Wealth, fame, power.

2
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,795
Gold Roger, the King of
the Pirates, attained this

3
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,299
and everything else
the world had to offer.

4
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:50,270
And his dying words drove
countless souls to the seas.

5
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,273
[GOLD ROGER]
You want my treasure?

6
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,374
You can have it!

7
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,744
I left everything I gathered
together in one place.

8
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,213
Now you just have to find it!

9
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,583
[NARRATOR] These words lured
men to the Grand Line in pursuit

10
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,619
of dreams greater than
they've ever dared to imagine!

11
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,089
This is the time known
as the Great Pirate Era!

12
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:11,692
[ONIGUMO] Those ranked
Lieutenant Commander or below,

13
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,559
stay put!

14
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,095
To the 200 elite
Captains and Commanders,

15
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,499
engage the enemy and
wipe them out immediately!

16
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,234
Destroy them!

17
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,403
[MARINES yelling]

18
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,472
[CAPTAIN 308A] Capture Nico
Robin and bring her here!

19
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,212
You don't have to worry
about protecting me anymore.

20
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,581
If the crew is fighting,
then I'm fighting, too.

21
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:43,290
Luffy'll be here soon--
We can't give up!

22
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,294
[MARINES yelling]

23
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,333
[LUCCI] So long as that woman is
wanted by the World Government,

24
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,069
I'll chase her to the ends
of the Earth if need be!

25
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,371
That is the
meaning of Dark Justice!

26
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,106
You won't be chasing anyone!

27
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:02,443
I'm putting an end to this,
right here, right now!

28
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,477
[LUFFY] Jet Stamp!

29
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,717
[LUCCI] Six King Gun!

30
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,128
[USOPP] Oh, no!

31
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,231
[CAPTAIN 308F] I got him!

32
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,166
[ZORO] Watch out!

33
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,668
Damn it, this is no time
for you to be spacing out, Us--

34
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,563
[USOPP] Luffy!

35
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,499
What the hell are you doing?

36
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,571
Get up!

37
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,573
Luffy!

38
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,646
[LUFFY] Fists Full of Emotion!

39
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:16,049
Luffy Unleashes Gatling
with All His Might!

40
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,586
[FRANKY] Weapons Left!

41
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,298
[FRANKY] Super!

42
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,569
[MARINE 309C] Commander!

43
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,304
Those Straw Hats
are no ordinary pirates!

44
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,606
They're insanely strong!

45
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,208
They're holding their
own against the Captains!

46
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,153
Huh! So that woman
has Devil Fruit powers!

47
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,788
Everyone attack on my command.

48
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,556
Go!

49
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,593
[MARINES yelling]

50
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,728
Now Cien Fleurs!

51
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,467
With a Flip!

52
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,177
Here we go.

53
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,279
Thunder Ball!

54
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,717
[NAMI]
Thunderbolt Tempo!

55
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,489
That'll teach you
to mess with us!

56
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,566
Guess these guys
are a bit stronger

57
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,368
than your average Marine.

58
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,408
Two-Sword Style...

59
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,214
[ZORO]
...Hawk Wave!

60
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,420
[ZORO] Who wants
their ass kicked next?

61
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,759
[ZORO] Usopp.

62
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,305
Luffy!

63
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,345
[USOPP]
Can you hear me?

64
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,486
Luffy!

65
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,721
Get up!

66
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:58,011
Usopp...

67
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,049
I didn't know
you were here, too.

68
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,656
[USOPP]
Don't get the wrong idea.

69
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,524
I just came here
to save Robin!

70
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,527
That's it, all right?

71
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,096
I didn't come to see
you or your stupid face,

72
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,265
understand me?

73
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,135
Come on. Enough.

74
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,235
What an idiot!

75
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,672
Hey, you!

76
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,140
The CP9 Boss Cat!

77
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,644
I know you hear me!

78
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,080
From here on out,
I'm your opponent!

79
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,748
Come and get some!

80
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,488
Yeah! That's right!

81
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,224
If you mess with Robin,
then you mess with me!

82
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,061
Now listen and
listen good, you bastard!

83
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,228
I'm a fearsome pirate!

84
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,530
A warrior among warriors!

85
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,633
And I command an army
of over 8000 men!

86
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:57,137
I am the great Captain Usopp!

87
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,642
[USOPP] I've sailed
all over the Grand Line.

88
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,078
I've destroyed
island after island,

89
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,513
wreaking havoc everywhere I go!

90
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,718
And if the World Government
wants to go toe to toe with me,

91
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,553
then I'll crush
every last one of you

92
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,055
with my little pinky finger!

93
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,361
Now come on up
here and fight me

94
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,629
if you've got the guts.

95
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,297
Or are you just a scaredy-cat?

96
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,205
No... No, wait...

97
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,741
Hey! Get back here!

98
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,243
You leave him alone!

99
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:39,280
This is between
you and me, got it?

100
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,714
[LUCCI] You've already lost.

101
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,217
I have no business with you.

102
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,653
I'm going to kill
every last one of them,

103
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:49,657
and save you for last
so you can watch it happen.

104
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,426
Come get me,
Boss Kitty-Cat!

105
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,329
I am gonna take you out!

106
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,530
You idiot!

107
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,667
Shut up, already!
He's gonna kill you!

108
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,668
You shut up!

109
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,703
What the hell are you
gonna do about it, huh?

110
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,437
You're almost dead!

111
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,442
That pigeon bastard's mine!

112
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,611
I'm gonna kick his ass
all over the place!

113
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,379
Then get up!

114
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,582
Show him what you're made of!

115
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,550
Stop lying around
coughing and bleeding

116
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,451
like you're about to die!

117
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:23,290
That is not the
Luffy I know at all!

118
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,830
Even though it's
filled with smoke,

119
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,632
we can still see the sky!

120
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:37,070
[USOPP]
We can still see the ocean!

121
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,212
[USOPP] This place isn't hell!

122
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,315
I can't believe you'd
let it end like this!

123
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,123
So stop acting like
you're about to die,

124
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,125
you stupid bastard!
What's wrong with you?

125
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,764
Why are you trying
to make us worry?

126
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,067
Get up and fight!

127
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,811
Finished with
your little speech?

128
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,448
Then I suggest you get ready
to show me what you've got.

129
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,487
[LUFFY]
You're right, Usopp.

130
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,593
[LUFFY] This place isn't hell.
It's not even close.

131
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,197
Luffy...

132
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,473
Finish him!

133
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:50,678
Then we can all leave
this place together!

134
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,447
I'll win no matter what!

135
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,021
I'm surprised you can stand.

136
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,594
I'm never gonna give up.

137
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,196
You hear me?

138
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,799
Until I defeat you,

139
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:17,204
I won't drop to the
ground ever again.

140
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,743
Now Life Return: Terminate.

141
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,149
This annoying farce of yours
has gone on long enough.

142
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,385
I'll crush you with a
single blow and end this,

143
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,320
once and for all.

144
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,824
Oh, and don't worry
about your little friends.

145
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,425
Just as you wished,

146
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:43,264
you'll all be reunited
once again very soon.

147
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:45,332
Once I kill you,
they're next,

148
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,268
then you'll spend
eternity together in hell.

149
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,051
Spots Attack!

150
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:13,560
[yelling]

151
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,304
How dare you!

152
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,540
You two can't treat
the marines like this!

153
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,409
As long as we stay clear
of those thunderclouds,

154
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:30,077
we got 'em.

155
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,314
Augh! There's
already another one?

156
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,282
All right, men!
We need to spread out!

157
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,451
Break formation and--
What is it? I'm busy here!

158
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,090
What the hell'd
ya do that for?

159
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,825
[NAMI] Hey, guys!

160
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,627
When the lightning
strikes this time,

161
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,196
try not to get too electrocuted.

162
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,197
Thunder Ball!

163
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,402
[NAMI] Thunderbolt Tempo!

164
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,772
[MARINES screaming]

165
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,346
Yeah!
Way to go, pirate ladies!

166
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,381
Meow! Meow!

167
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,582
[KOKORO] Nice work!

168
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,784
Listen.
We're all okay over here,

169
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:14,321
so go on upstairs
and help those boys out!

170
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,558
Your raccoon-dog will be
safe here with us, okay?

171
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,126
Meow!

172
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,761
Racoon-dog?

173
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,663
I'm a reindeer. A reindeer!

174
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,730
Okay, then!

175
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,599
We'll leave Chopper with you!
Take care of him!

176
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,233
Ready?

177
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,234
Yeah.

178
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,306
Everyone's fighting
as hard as they can,

179
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,541
and I can't do
