00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.414
[NARRATOR] All pirates searching
for the treasure One Piece

00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:40.187
must brave the second half
of the Grand Line.

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:45.463
These wild and dangerous seas
are known as the New World.

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.869
Gold Roger and his crew
were the only men to ever

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.242
chart these waters and
learn all the secrets they held.

00:02:51.342 --> 00:02:52.946
For the rest of the
pirates in the world,

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:55.351
this has proven to be
the end of the road.

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.524
A graveyard of dreams.

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:02.498
[NARRATOR] Now, Monkey D. Luffy,
a boy whose body became rubber

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.101
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.243
sets sail into the New World
with his faithful crew.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:12.484
I'm gonna be the
King of the Pirates!

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:20.100
[NARRATOR] The Straw Hats
formed an alliance with Law

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.507
and targeted the Don Quixote
Family in Dressrosa.

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:26.446
In response, Doflamingo trapped
the kingdom inside a barrier

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:28.718
and challenged
all present to a game.

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:30.755
After a series of
harrowing battles,

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.491
the Straw Hats and
their allies defeated

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:35.096
each of the Don Quixote
Family Executives.

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.800
When only Doflamingo remained,

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:39.071
he threatened to massacre
everyone in the kingdom

00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:40.742
with his deadly "Birdcage."

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:43.079
With Dressrosa's destruction
close at hand,

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.918
Luffy engages in a desperate
struggle against Doflamingo,

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:48.123
trading one powerful blow
after another.

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:51.395
Until, at last, the fate of
the kingdom is decided.

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:55.003
All right. King Kong...

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:01.817
All those who won't
obey me must die.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:05.023
My Sixteen Holy Bullets
shall be your trial!

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:11.636
[DOFLAMINGO]
God Thread!

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:14.876
[yells]

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:18.449
...Gun!

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:40.928
[LUFFY yelling]

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:49.812
When I'm done,
nothing will remain!

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:01.101
[LUFFY yelling]

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:35.671
[LUFFY] "To Be Free!
Dressrosa's Delight!"

00:05:49.097 --> 00:05:53.974
[TOWNSPEOPLE screaming]

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:21.963
[LUFFY panting]

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.199
[panting]

00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:57.034
[LUFFY]
Huh. Well, that's kinda funny.

00:06:57.134 --> 00:06:59.105
I wound up wearing
the same fighting costume

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:01.075
as this old guy.

00:07:01.643 --> 00:07:04.081
But I gotta admit,
it does look cool.

00:07:04.181 --> 00:07:05.183
And real manly!

00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:08.490
Yeah, I like it, too.

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:10.728
You're such a great fighter.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:14.135
I was really impressed
when I saw that last battle.

00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:18.511
I swear. No matter
what it takes,

00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:20.881
I will win this
competition today!

00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:23.588
And with the power of
the Flame-Flame Fruit,

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:26.025
I'll kill Doflamingo!

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:43.760
[VIOLET] If you promise
to let my father live,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.899
then I'll submit to you!

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:49.673
Please! Anything!
Just spare him!

00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:51.375
[DOLDO]
Viola, wait.

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:53.479
Why place your faith in them?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.983
They're criminals.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.452
That's fine.

00:07:56.553 --> 00:07:59.559
Our kingdom must be broken
down and its lies exposed.

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:00.928
They'll do that.

00:08:01.028 --> 00:08:03.834
I trust them to
end this false peace.

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:06.172
So I'm betting everything
on the Straw Hats.

00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:08.778
After all these years,
I don't want the Navy's help!

00:08:08.878 --> 00:08:11.048
They have failed
our people enough!

00:08:11.148 --> 00:08:12.484
But Straw Hat?

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.990
He acts on the goodness
inside his heart.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.295
Even though he's a pirate,
he hasn't lost his humanity!

00:08:22.605 --> 00:08:28.182
[LAW panting]

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:38.603

[VIOLET]
He's still breathing, isn't he?

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:56.806
[REBECCA]
Yes, he is.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:08:59.010
Straw Hat.

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.816
[TOWNSMAN B] Look!
Nobody's up there anymore!

00:09:53.386 --> 00:09:54.321
Hey, you're right.

00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.760
So is it over yet?

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.797
[TOWNSMAN F]
What just happened?

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:00.767
[TOWNSMAN G]
Give us an update, Gyats!

Hey, Gyats!

C'mon, pal!

00:10:06.547 --> 00:10:07.982
[TOWNSMAN I]
Are you listening?

00:10:08.082 --> 00:10:09.853
[TOWNSWOMAN A]
You saw what happened, right?

00:10:09.953 --> 00:10:11.790

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:21.810
Be careful! Ah!

00:10:21.976 --> 00:10:24.749
You've been yelling
too much-- Take it easy!

00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:26.720
[ATTENDANT A]
You're still injured!

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.629
Step away! [pants]
I have a duty to fulfill.

00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:33.800
The citizens are waiting!

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.340
Pathetic!

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.081
What kind of announcer am I
if I can't announce the winner?

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.190
Look, you two.

The Birdcage.

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:40.132
And also, Doflamingo's
reign over us!

Don't you recognize
my voice, Esta?

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.914
Why don't you remember
who I am? I'm not a toy!

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:06.119
Get away, you disgusting
little creep!

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:07.688
[ESTA'S BOYFRIEND]
This is absurd!

00:12:07.788 --> 00:12:11.529
Unhand me, you fiends!
I'm a human!

The sky! The sky!
It's clear again!

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.901
The view that I see
may look grim.

00:14:11.135 --> 00:14:14.340
But it's not a town
that's been torn to shreds.

00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:16.212
Not to me!

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:20.955
Rather, it as a land
of boundless freedom.

00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:24.327
One of infinite potential!

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.005
Holy crapola. It's really gone.

What could I possibly say?

Nothing can justify this.

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:09.310
[BOTH crying]

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.050
He's really something,
that Straw Hat!

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.989
Yeah, he's a true man among men.

00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:16.458
He touched my heart!

00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:21.301
Oh, honey! That is
so sweet! [giggles]

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:23.973
[ELIZABELLO] Yeah!
Let's hear it for Straw Hat!

00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:26.045
He's one of a kind!

00:18:26.145 --> 00:18:28.315
[JEET, ABDULLAH cheer]

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:32.825
[LEO crying]
Robiland! Luffyland is great!

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:35.396
He's really great, isn't he?

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:39.738
Yes! Though he's already
proven that many times.

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.076
[cheering]

00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:44.815
I wasn't scared at all!

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:57.274
[KIN'EMON]
Splendid work, Sir Luffy!

00:18:57.374 --> 00:18:59.110
[KANJURO]
Remarkable, indeed!

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.914
[KIN'EMON]
I stand in awe!

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:07.961
Y'see?

00:19:08.062 --> 00:19:09.832
Wonderful!

00:19:09.932 --> 00:19:12.303
[DWARVES]
Fraland!

00:19:13.372 --> 00:19:16.512
Nice work, bros!
You're all heroes, too!

00:19:16.612 --> 00:19:18.616
[DWARVES]
Don't squeeze so hard!

00:19:21.556 --> 00:19:24.629
[KYROS] Simple.
This kingdom's divided.

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:27.266
A country filled
with the forgotten,

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.237
and those who forget them!

00:19:32.844 --> 00:19:36.919
Every toy you see
was at one point a human!

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:38.422
The Commander!

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:41.261
Those are the Little
People from Tontatta.

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:43.766
They will be fighting
Doflamingo with us.

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:48.543
Brother. I don't know
what's goin' on,

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:50.647
but you shouldn't
make a girl cry.

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:54.722
I know I'm just a toy.
But I must protect her.

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:58.896
These useless tin eyes of mine
can't even shed a tear for her.

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:02.972
He's been fighting on
his own for a whole decade,

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:05.544
but he never gave up,
and he never lost hope.

00:20:05.644 --> 00:20:08.349
Look, this place may seem happy,

00:20:08.449 --> 00:20:11.121
but these guys know
how dark it really is.

00:20:11.656 --> 00:20:13.926
This little army
is brave as hell.

00:20:14.026 --> 00:20:17.266
Staring down an enemy
that's pure evil!

00:20:17.366 --> 00:20:22.309
I can't just leave 'em
to die. I'm sorry.

00:20:23.012 --> 00:20:24.380
[LUFFY]
Franky!

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.519
Kick some ass out there.

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:29.257
[FRANKY]
Wow! Thanks, brother!

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:36.840
[WICKA, COTTON]
Don't cry, Fraland!

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.818
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:51.335
[KYROS]
You filthy pirate.

00:20:51.435 --> 00:20:54.307
What did you do? Let him go!

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:57.146
Riku here was the one
burning the kingdom down.

00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:58.482
It wasn't me.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.520
The king would never
do such a thing!

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:02.456
[DOFLAMINGO] Now, you'll
wanna watch carefully.

00:21:02.557 --> 00:21:04.394
You're witnessing history!

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:07.366
The final moments
of the Riku Dynasty!

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:10.507
[DOFLAMINGO] Crazy bastard
cut off his own leg!

00:21:14.749 --> 00:21:17.053
It's Kyros! Please, believe me!

00:21:17.654 --> 00:21:20.860
Sorry. I fear that name
doesn't ring a bell.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.363
[gasps]

00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:24.668
[DOLDO]
Regardless, I'll never forget

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:27.508
what you did
for me, toy soldier.

00:21:27.608 --> 00:21:28.943
[KYROS]
Listen well!

00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:31.615
My friends, this battle
is a chance for us

00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:33.452
to reclaim our freedom,

00:21:33.887 --> 00:21:37.326
and to restore the honor
of our dethroned King Riku!

00:21:37.628 --> 00:21:43.673
[TOWNSPEOPLE cheering]

00:21:49.718 --> 00:21:51.421
Kyros was your name?

00:21:54.327 --> 00:21:56.465
Come with me, please.

00:21:56.566 --> 00:22:03.445
I wish... this world...
would forget about me!

00:22:07.521 --> 00:22:10.693
I fear I've failed to
repay your kindness.

00:22:10.793 --> 00:22:15.937
[SCARLET] Kyros.
She's your child! Hold her!

00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:16.939
[REBECCA giggles]

00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:24.989
[KYROS]
These useless tin arms of mine.

00:22:25.089 --> 00:22:28.930
I can't even feel your warmth,
one last time!

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:34.675
[REBECCA]
Help me, Soldier!

00:22:34.776 --> 00:22:37.079
[KYROS]
Keep your hands off her!

00:22:37.179 --> 00:22:40.385
You have taken enough from me!

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:50.573
[crying]

00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:56.317
[NARRATOR]
The collapse of a kingdom

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:58.188
isn't always a tragedy
for its people.

00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:01.427
In Dressrosa, even amongst
the piles of rubble,

00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:05.737
the citizens there shed
tears of joy and relief.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.626
[NARRATOR] Sabo burns
with anger towards Burgess,

00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:18.696
who mocks the last words of Ace.

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:21.468
Meanwhile, Fujitora makes
a surprising declaration

00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:23.839
that sends waves
across the entire world.

00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:25.843
When the truth of
Dressrosa is exposed,

00:23:25.943 --> 00:23:27.948
the future of the Navy
and pirates alike

00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:29.417
may be transformed.

00:23:29.518 --> 00:23:31.188
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:32.657
"The Unheard-of!

00:23:32.757 --> 00:23:35.396
Admiral Fujitora's
Surprising Decision!"

00:23:35.496 --> 00:23:38.068
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
