1
00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:02,703
Right.

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,605
So even though we got in
a few fights back in town

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,409
with both the Franky Family and
with the Galley-La shipwrights,

4
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:13,446
the enemy we're all going
after here is one and the same.

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,017
From this point forward,
we fight as one!

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,687
Now Gum-Gum--

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,122
Three Hundred Caliber--

8
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:26,393
We're gonna crash!

9
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,903
Cannon!

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:41,041
We... We made it!

11
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,445
That you, Luffy?

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,681
Yep, it's me!

13
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:48,715
What's up?

14
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,450
You save Robin?

15
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,018
No, sorry.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,621
Afraid I'm still
working on that one.

17
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,458
Nami told me why Robin
surrendered and all that stuff.

18
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,059
I see.

19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,460
That's good.

20
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,231
Well anyway,
you know what's next.

21
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,333
Go ahead give 'em hell, Sanji.

22
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,168
He'll die if he fights them now!

23
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:11,071
If wants to stand a chance,
he's gotta wait on us!

24
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,672
Hey, Cook, can you hear me?

25
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,709
Some of the guys on that
train are really tough--

26
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,277
Zoro!

27
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,112
It's fine.

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,851
If it was you, would you wait?

29
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,255
If you were on that train
right now instead of him and

30
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,426
I told you that Robin sacrificed
herself to protect us.

31
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,295
Would you just sit
there and do nothing?

32
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,933
No use trying to stop him.

33
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,334
But thanks, Moss Head.

34
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,803
I never knew you cared
about me so much.

35
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,238
I hope they kill you!

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,173
Anyway, that settles it.

37
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:50,410
I was willing to fight for Robin
even before I knew the truth.

38
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,881
But now that you told me
how she really feels.

39
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,317
I wouldn't stop,
even if you begged me.

40
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:02,856
No, I'm... I'm not coming.

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,758
Eh?

42
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,028
This doesn't have anything
to do with me anymore.

43
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,964
You're about to make
yourselves personal enemies

44
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,765
of the World Government.

45
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,533
I don't wanna be
any part of that.

46
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:18,139
Besides, Luffy and the
rest of the crew are coming.

47
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:22,075
I still feel bad for
Robin but I'm sorry.

48
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,311
It's not my job
to save her anymore.

49
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,180
I am not a part of Luffy's crew!

50
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,221
See ya.

51
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,595
Ahhh! They're right here!

52
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,896
Dammit, they found us!

53
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,165
Metallic Star!

54
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,274
Who the hell are you?!

55
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,916
Your friend told me everything.

56
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,017
I understand that you're here

57
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,320
to rescue a certain
mademoiselle.

58
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,090
That alone is reason enough
for me to join your cause.

59
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,260
My weapons are at your disposal.

60
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,603

He has too much pride to
show his face to the crew,

83
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,136

Hey!

Get over here!

89
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,314
Oh, sure.

90
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,353
'Kay.

91
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:36,489
Let's start the meeting for
"Operation Rescue Robin."

92
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,293
We've never met before.

93
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,862
Don't you two have
any questions about me?

94
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,199
So the car you were
in was car number 6.

95
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,200
That means that
we've got five more left.

96
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,603
Y'know, like
"where's Sniper Island?"

97
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,938
But we don't know which
one of those Robin is in.

98
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,208
The answer is:
It's in your heart.

99
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,146
And by the way are you strong?

100
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,448
Are you kidding,
I'm super strong!

101
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,283
Even stronger
than usual this week!

102
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:07,488
Remember, the point is to rescue
Robin, not beat the enemy.

103
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,756
'Least in theory.

104
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,058
We're up against
a lot of Marines,

105
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:12,325
in a narrow space

106
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,895
so we gotta make sure
we don't get surrounded.

107
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,931
We should avoid as
many fights as we can,

108
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,533
and whittle down the
main force in turns.

109
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,934
Makes sense to me.

110
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,303
Even though
we're total strangers,

111
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,405
my intuition tells me that
I can trust your judgment.

112
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,341
With that in mind.
I have a plan.

113
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:28,842
Oh?

114
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,077
Hm?

115
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,746
Here we go, listen up.

116
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,593
Am... Am I dreaming?!

117
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,505
It's a miracle.

118
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,176
Okay!

119
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,979
Now I'm ready for battle!

120
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,347
Hm? What's going on?

121
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,583
Don't you play innocent
with me, immoral girl!

122
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:11,118
Have you no shame,
changing your clothes

123
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,520
out here in front of everyone?!

124
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,356
Shame is overrated.

125
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,626
What was I supposed to do?

126
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,594
The train only has one car!

127
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:21,896
Cover up your legs!

128
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,163
Cover up your stomach!

129
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:25,299
That goes for you too,
Square-Head-Sisters!

130
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,901
People like you are
corrupting society!

131
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,304
Whatever, you're just too shy.

132
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,872
Shy boy!

133
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,507
Why, you!

134
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,643
If you fellas like,
I could change too.

135
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,646
Please, anything but that.

136
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,046
We promise we'll behave.

137
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,583
If you don't like mature women,
it's your loss.

138
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:46,487
Stupid black shorts with
their stupid tiny pockets!

139
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,656
Come on get in there!

140
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,126
Don't put meat in
your pants, you idiot!

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,129
I'm starting to think you
might actually pull this off!

142
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,699
You certainly seem
riled up, if nothing else!

143
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,933
You bet we are!

144
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,935
Those jerks got away
with Robin last time,

145
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,303
but now that
I know what's going on,

146
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,972
they don't stand a chance!

147
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,206
I hope you're right!

148
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,908
'Cause if you get stuck
in something again,

149
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,643
you're gonna have hell to pay!

150
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,144
Nah, don't worry,

151
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,880
I got a reason to beat
them this time around!

152
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,816
Uh, right.

153
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,883
Hey.

154
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,285
Did you change
your weapon, Nami?

155
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:18,919
Hm?

156
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,121
Oh, no.

157
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,322
It's pretty much the
same one as before.

158
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,091
Usopp just improved
it with some dials

159
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,193
after we got back from Skypeia.

160
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,963
This is the Perfect Clima Takt.

161
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:29,997
I see.

162
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,265
So that's his--

163
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:31,865
Right.

164
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:32,933
It's Usopp's...

165
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,335
Uh...

166
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,637
Last work...

167
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,241
Don't get all sad now!

168
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,722
You ready?

169
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,691
Let's do this.

170
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,528
An intruder?

171
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,229
Uh, yes, sir.

172
00:11:02,263 --> 00:11:04,331
That's what I heard.

173
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,835
It's not feasible to board the
Puffing Tom while it's running.

174
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,470
If there really is
an intruder that means

175
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,807
we let him sneak on
board before we departed.

176
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,309
What an embarrassment.

177
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,845
I agree, sir.
It's inexcusable.

178
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,246
But if you can't get on

179
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,849
while the train is moving,
you can't get off, either.

180
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,283
That means the intruder as well

181
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:26,053
as the missing prisoners
are still here somewhere.

182
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,988
You just have to find them.

183
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,689
Yes, sir!

184
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,508
Captain T-Bone.

185
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,644
I don't think there's any room
for someone to hide in here.

186
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,053
Good evening!

187
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:02,790
It's them!

188
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,057
They were right outside!

189
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,859
We found 3 suspicious men,

190
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,029
including the
criminals in car 7!

191
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,865
Corner and capture them!

192
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,701
Ever use a hammer before?

193
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,969
'Cause you sure do suck.

194
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,003
Sh-Shut up!

195
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,238
There's no point in resisting!

196
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,106
Open the door already!

197
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,710
They're gonna break through!

198
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,845
I know!

199
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,946
This way!

200
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,848
They found the
intruder in car #7!

201
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:29,283
The criminals, too?

202
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,017
Yeah.

203
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,352
Let the guys in car 3 know.

204
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,821
That Franky guy's
a lot of trouble.

205
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,623
Move in and capture them alive!

206
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,658
Move it! Stand back!

207
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,195
Whoa!

208
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,029
They're shooting at us!

209
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,364
Then hurry it up!

210
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:45,131
A little help would be nice!

211
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,237
Don't shoot blindly!

212
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,574
We don't want these guys dead!

213
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,609
You're right.

214
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,611
What do we do, Captain T-Bone?

215
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,113
Allow me to handle this.

216
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:08,722
I hate crooked men
and crooked swordplay.

217
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,791
Here comes my Right-Angle Flash!

218
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,463
Bone Soir!

219
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:54,067
I hate crooked men
and crooked swordplay.

220
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,939
Here comes my Right-Angle Flash!

221
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:02,175
Bone Soir!

222
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,021
They're gone!

223
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:24,097
The roof?

224
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:32,139
Go!

225
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,341
They're at the end of the train!

226
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,610
Now! Hurry!

227
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,481
Oh no.

228
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,751
Everyone get back to
the front cars right now!

229
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,220
This is a trap!

230
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,588
What are you talking about?

231
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:49,356
What the?!

232
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,225
Quick! Retreat-they tricked us!

233
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,626
Huh?!

234
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,894
We can't go back anymore.

235
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:55,262
The door is blocked.

236
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,529
No way.

237
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,700
The cars are detached!

238
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,571
What?!

239
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,404
Damn it!

240
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,706
That's cheating!

241
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,008
You'll pay for this!

242
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,079
I was too late.

243
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,847
Have a safe trip, gentlemen!

244
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,450
Say hello to the
Sea Kings for me!

245
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,119
Fair thee well!

246
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,256
That's two cars down!

247
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,158
Should cut the small fries
down by about 50 or so.

248
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,262
But aren't Luffy and the others
coming on the same railway?

249
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,797
What happens when the
cars run into each other?

250
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,466
Eh, they'll come
up with something.

251
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,435
You arrogant thugs.

252
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:38,171
I'm gonna tear this door
down and you with it!

253
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:42,109
Oh?

254
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,710
Going for a swim?

255
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,651
All right five to go!

256
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:51,752
You bastard.

257
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,320
You're gonna
suffer for that one!

258
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,822
What will poor
Captain T-Bone do?!

259
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:56,623
Hey!

260
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,824
Report this to CP9!

261
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,093
Great, more of these guys.

262
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,500
And Frit Assorti!

263
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:14,407
Sniper King Gunpowder Star!

264
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:19,579
Strong Right!

265
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,518
Huh?

266
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,087
Heavy weight shot fire!

267
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,624
Whoa! They hit him!

268
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,634
That hurt.

269
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,336
Keep shooting!

270
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,046
Why isn't the gun
working on him?!

271
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,731
Whoa, that was crazy.
What the hell are you?!

272
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:11,965
Huh?

273
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,102
Oh guess I forgot to
tell you, I'm a cyborg.

274
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,436
Those are real?!

275
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,571
Yep.

276
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,473
I got steel and weapons
built right into my body.

277
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,376
It still kinda
hurts if I get shot

278
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,611
and I might bleed a little, too.

279
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,580
But no big deal.

280
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,915
Just when you think
you've seen it all!

281
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,551
The world's a crazy place.

282
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,085
Awesome!

283
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:34,387
Poke.

284
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,323
Auuughhh!!

285
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,458
What in the hell was that for?!

286
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,460
Huh?

287
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,995
You can deflect bullets,
but needles hurt?

288
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,630
For one, I'm not
your science experiment,

289
00:17:42,663 --> 00:17:43,964
so stop poking me!

290
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,432
And for two, just so you know,

291
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,768
my back isn't the
same as my front!

292
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,868
Get it?

293
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,203
I had to do the
operation on myself,

294
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,206
so I couldn't reach
around behind me.

295
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,376
In other words, only
the front side is cyborg!

296
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,244
I see.

297
00:17:57,277 --> 00:18:00,114
While I'm at it, lemme tell
you another little secret.

298
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,915
My belly is always cold.

299
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,450
Can you guess why?

300
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,485
How would I know?

301
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,787
It's 'cause I got
my own personal fridge

302
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,756
in there to keep my cola cool!

303
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,157
Wow, that's handy!

304
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,659
Man, that's gotta
be great in the summer!

305
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:19,132
Okay, the cola
thing is really neat,

306
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,533
but we don't have time for this!

307
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,570
We gotta get moving
to the next car!

308
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,773
This one is number 4.

309
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,112
Hm?

310
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,219
I'm Wanze!

311
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,787
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, world

312
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,456
and I'm a mad, mad,
mad, mad, Wanze!

313
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,229
Here I come!

314
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:55,636
What's up you guys?

315
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,537
Are you hungry?

316
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,171
You look hungry.

317
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,271
How 'bout some ramen?

318
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,673
I'm the head
steward of this train

319
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,942
so I can cook anything you
fellas would like to eat.

320
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,343
Okay, ramen it is,

321
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,712
but before I start,
a little trivia for you.

322
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,582
My nose hairs're
shaped like this!

323
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,583
They crisscross inside

324
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,585
so they look just like
fishnet stockings.

325
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,821
This is very important!

326
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,889
First I grab the flour.

327
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:21,761
And knead it in
my mouth like this.

328
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,472
Done! Here!

329
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,309
Hell, no!

330
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,511
Okay, that was a waste of time.

331
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,547
Listen we've got someone
waiting on us, Wanze.

332
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,817
You'll have to enjoy that
nose ramen on your own.

333
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,186
Not so fast!

334
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:49,089
If you wanna pass
through this car,

335
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:52,559
you'll have to defeat me first!

336
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,066
You think <i>you</i> can stop us?

337
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,367
I know I can!

338
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,135
Go, go, go!

339
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,438
This is an important
escort mission

340
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:08,708
so they got an important guy
like me to keep the train safe!

341
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,512
If you wanna rescue
that friend of yours

342
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,382
then first you'll have
to defeat my Ramen Kenpo!

343
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,485
Ra-Ramen Kenpo?

344
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,121
Ra-Ramen Kenpooooo?

345
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:24,091
That little turd
is making fun of me!

346
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,393
I know he's annoying,
but you gotta keep your cool!

347
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,262
How'd you like my
idiot imitation,

348
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,064
was it dumb enough for you?

349
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,432
Don't let him get to you!

350
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,402
Go, go, go, go!

351
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:38,171
This dude got ants
in his pants or what?

352
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,713
I swear that I grazed him
with one of those shots.

353
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,015
But he doesn't even care!

354
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,017
He even looks happy!

355
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,252
I thought my heart was
gonna leap outta my chest!

356
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,520
How was I supposed
to know you make

357
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,422
that same stupid face
for everything!

358
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,992
I'll take this guy
down, just watch.

359
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,292
Hold on.

360
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,561
You can't let this
clown get under your skin.

361
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,199
We got more important things to
do than sit here and play games.

362
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:08,068
You stay back and
I'll make quick work of him.

363
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,271
I don't know what your deal is,
but if you were a real chef,

364
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:14,407
you'd conduct yourself
with a little more dignity.

365
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,511
I'm talking to you, stupid!

366
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,851
Why don't you take your own
advice for once?!

367
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:25,085
Look!

368
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,088
He dodged that kick
without even blinking!

369
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,957
In fact, he even looks happy!

370
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,359
I thought I was gonna die!

371
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,827
Stop making that damn face!

372
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,296
Don't do the same joke twice!

373
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,604
I've had enough.

374
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:51,011
Like I said, this guy is mine.

375
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,178
You go ahead.

376
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,781
I'll catch up
with you two later.

377
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:16,096
How do you like my
mad mad Ramen Kenpo?

378
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:17,631
Pretty crazy, huh?

379
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,834
I hate people who
play with their food.

380
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,001
If you're gonna talk saucy,

381
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:23,103
you better bring
your cooking skills!

382
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:24,405
It's not like me
to use my hands,

383
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:26,507
but since this is
a kitchen battle,

384
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,641
I'll make an exception

385
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,043
and show you how a
real chef handles his knives.

386
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:33,180
On the next One Piece:
"Showdown between Cooks!

387
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,849
Sanji vs. Ramen Kenpo."

388
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,552
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!!
