Hey, you guys!

179
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,668
Look there!

180

[GROUP]
Crocodile?!

181
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,365
[VIVI] Now that this
conflict has escalated,

182
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,767
more blood will be shed
throughout the kingdom.

183
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,436
We're at war.

184
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,271
[sobs] You're trying to
get me home safely,

185
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,439
but there's no time!

186
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,874
I need to get home
as quickly as possible!

187
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,109
If I don't make it back in time,

188
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,946
a million innocent citizens will
give their lives needlessly!

190
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,326
[LUFFY]
Right. Well, this should be fun!

191
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,962
All we have to do is beat
up that Crocodile guy!

I don't know how he got
there in the first place,

195
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,345
but I'm sure it can
only mean one thing.

196
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,081
I knew it! I knew it!

197
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,150
I never doubted it for a second!

198
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,419
It can only mean‐‐

199
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,022
[GROUP]
Luffy did it! He won!

[VIVI sobs]

203
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,979
Don't shed any more blood.

Stop fighting!

[KOZA]
Do you see it?

210
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,869
[TOTO]
Don't be so suspicious, Koza.

211
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,845
[TOTO]
The rain will fall.

212
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,896
[KOZA]
The battle... will end.

213
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,136
[TASHIGI]
Rain.

00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,277
[SOLDIERS yelling]

215
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,386
[TASHIGI]
The madness has finally stopped.

216
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,921
They're beginning to hesitate.

217
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,393
[CHOPPER] The rain is
starting to clear the air.

218
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,969
Stop fighting!

219
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,707
Listen to me!

220
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,623
They've heard
Vivi's voice. Finally.

221
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,598
Vivi.

222
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,366
The princess.

223
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,634
Vivi?

224
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,836
I didn't know the
princess had come back.

[COBRA]
Hey! Are you all right?

226
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,160
[ROYAL SOLDIER B]
Sir Crocodile?

227
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,628
[ROYAL SOLDIER C]
How did he get here?

228
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,630
What happened to him?

229
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,499
Oh, so they're still
calling him Sir Crocodile?

230
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,536
We'll see if he's Sir Crocodile
after I tell them what's what!

231
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,739
Hold on. Just stay here.

[VIVI]
The rain has returned.

233
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,662
And will fall again,
as it used to.

234
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,499
Our nightmare is over.

235
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,834
Finally over.
