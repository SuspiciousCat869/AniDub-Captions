00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,560
Travel across the oceans of the world

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,930
Bellow a battle cry

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,730
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,450
We've left the established course

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,870
Right now, we're rowing straight toward

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,250
The borderline between the sky and the ocean

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,630
In the dark depths of the ocean,
adventure holds its breath

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,600
Don't you have a good time just imagining it?

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,060
Travel across the oceans of the world

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,310
Bellow a battle cry

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,070
Once your heart feels refreshed,
let the signal to set sail ring out

12
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,660
"That feeling" I get when embarking

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,170
Is something I hope to remember always

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,630
If I can, I won't be afraid of anything

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,890
With our pulses racing, let's go on a trip now

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,940
Shy hearts engrave the rhythm of adventure

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,190
Snatch up the treasure here and there

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
While laughing out loud

19
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,910
As we dash by like a noisy party

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,450
Make some waves...

21
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Life is "Adventurous"

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,200
Be aware it's "Dangerous"

23
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,910
Who's gonna be "One of us"

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,540
And a trip goes on because

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,170
We da pirate of the "Mass"

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,040
To the West, To the East

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,380
Gotta find my way, Sail away

28
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,550
All the way to "One piece"!!

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
Stuff a dream into your empty chest

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,010
And spread your wings

31
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,390
If the wind blowing through
them dyes your heart

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,730
Let's press forward

33
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,770
Snatch up the treasure here and there

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,190
While laughing out loud

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,570
As we dash by like a noisy party

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
Make some waves...

37
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,700
[NARRATOR] This is the time
known as the Great Pirate Era.

38
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:41,469
A countless array of pirates
go to battle across the seas

39
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:44,772
in search of the One Piece, the
legendary treasure left behind

40
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:47,609
by Gold Roger,
King of the Pirates.

41
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:50,445
Monkey D. Luffy, a boy
whose body turned to rubber

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,980
after eating the Gum-Gum Fruit,

43
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:54,949
sets sail to become the
next King of the Pirates.

44
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:57,752
As Luffy and his crew
conquer numerous obstacles,

45
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:59,521
they capture the
unwanted attention

46
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,989
of the World Government,

47
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:05,260
which will use any means
necessary to stop them.

48
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,829
[LUFFY]
Now this is exciting!

49
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:11,232
I can't wait to see what
kind of adventure's up next!

50
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,402
[NARRATOR] With a charted course
awash in danger and intrigue,

51
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:19,207
the crew will cut a path across
the Grand Line to the New World!

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,513
[NARRATOR] After being
separated from his crew,

53
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:28,550
Luffy set out to rescue
his captured brother, Ace.

54
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,287
To do so, he snuck into the
government prison, Impel Down.

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,958
[NARRATOR] Along the way,
he ran into Buggy,

56
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:40,995
as well as former Baroque Works
agents Mr. 3 and Mr. 2.

57
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:44,532
Together, they fell from
Level 3 down to Level 4.

58
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,467
[LUFFY] Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

59
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,036
That smells so good.

60
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:48,970
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

61
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:51,906
Oh boy, I can't wait
for yummy food time.

62

[BON CLAY screaming]

64
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:58,980
[MAGELLAN]
It's time to put an end

65
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:02,350
to your buffoonery,
once and for all, boy!

66
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:03,818
Who're you?

67
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,589
It's... Magellan!

68
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,456
[gasps]

69
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,860
I've got you now,
you criminal scum!

70
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,967
[LUFFY]
"Mighty Magellan!

71

74
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,890
[GUARD A] Oh, crap!
I gotta get outta here!

75
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:46,327
It's truly quite hot down here.

76
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:50,798
[GUARD B]
W-Warden! Wait! Please!

77
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,066
Give us a second!

78
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,836
[GUARD C]
Don't start fighting yet!

79
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,404
[GUARD D]
Everyone, clear out!

80
00:04:56,437 --> 00:04:58,973
The Warden's poison
will get us, too!

81
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,609
[LUFFY grunting]

82
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,081
[LUFFY]
You suck!

83
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:08,049
I was finally gonna make it

84
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,885
to all that awesome-smelling
food over there!

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,722
I'm hot, I'm mad,
and I'm hungry!

86
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,057
Get the hell outta my way!

87
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,926
Food is your concern?
Very well, then.

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,663
Soon, you'll never have
to worry about eating again.

89
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,931
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:27,402
Straw Boy, whatever you do,
don't fight him!

91
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:32,440
Listen, that's Magellan,
the Warden of Impel Down!

92
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:35,009
He has the power of
the Venom-Venom Fruit!

93
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,145
He's the last person
you ever wanna fight!

94
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,880
Make a run for it!

95
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,449
[LUFFY]
Venom-Venom fruit? He's poison?

96
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,684
[MAGELLAN]
Indeed I am.

97
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,886
You're a bit out of
your element, Straw Hat.

98
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,154
Even though you're a rookie,

99
00:05:46,187 --> 00:05:49,891
I expected more from a pirate
with a bounty of 300 million,

100
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:52,460
especially one who has caused
the World Government

101
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,561
so much trouble.

102
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,564
Speaking of trouble,
I can't imagine how you managed

103
00:05:56,597 --> 00:06:00,401
to worm your way through
security, but here you are.

104
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:03,805
[MAGELLAN]
Rest assured, you will suffer

105
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:05,873
for tarnishing my reputation.

106
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,942
I know why you're here,
by the way.

107
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,712
You came to rescue
your brother, Portgas D. Ace,

108
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,548
second division commander
of the Whitebeard Pirates.

109
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,983
An ambitious endeavor,
if a foolish one.

110
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:18,853
Though struggle as you might,
both his fate and yours

111
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,522
were sealed the moment
you set foot here.

112
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:23,124
You've had quite
the little rampage,

113
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:26,060
but all of that will
come to an end now.

114
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,228
And one final thing,

115
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,598
I will find out exactly how
you broke into my prison.

116
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:34,602
You will spill every last,
juicy detail to me.

117
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,674
[HANCOCK]
It's safe now, Luffy.

118
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,778
[LUFFY]
Wow, that was close!

119
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,180
Even so, I'm afraid
that this is as far

120
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,983
as I'll be able to accompany
you. They're quite insistent

121
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:51,986
on placing me in those
Sea Prism Stone Handcuffs.

122
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,722
And, once they take my cloak,
you'll have nowhere to hide.

123
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:57,859
I just wish-I wish I could
do more to help you, but--

124
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,527
Aw, don't talk like that.

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,062
You got me in
this place, didn't ya?

126
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,097
That's more than
I coulda done alone.

127
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:03,998

00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,833

129
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:08,503
[LUFFY]
I'll die before I say a word.

130
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:11,706
Ha. You criminals always
spout that sort of nonsense

131
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,976
before your interrogation.
But listen, Straw Hat,

132
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,645
when you face the torment
I have in store for you,

133
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:20,047
you'll say anything
for the mercy of death.

135
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:23,985
Listen, please!

136
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:26,087
Magellan's whole body
is poisonous!

137
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,022
Crazy, terrible poison!

138
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:30,224
If you so much as
touch him, you're finished!

139
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:32,126
You can't beat a guy like that!

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,127

I will!

go back the way we came.

This way! Give up
on that stupid food

it to Level 5!

There's no escape.

The staircase to Level 5

Guards and their commander.

has already been accounted for.
There will be no more running.

Now, should I stop them,

152
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:03,090
or should I let
the Warden take the blame?

I'm telling you!

00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:14,228
[BON CLAY] Magellan is
only aiming for Straw Boy.

00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,198
--Un, deux, trois!
--[LUFFY yelps]

177
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:18,332
Huh?

178
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:20,201
[LUFFY]
Now Gum-Gum!

179
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:23,371
I said Gum-Gum!

180
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,805
[MAGELLAN]
Hmm?

181
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,675
[BON CLAY (LUFFY)]
Lovely Pistol!

182
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,611
Cross-Dresser Gatling!

00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:33,247
Ballerina Giant Scythe!

184
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,949
A bit confused, aren't you?

185
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,084
"I wonder which one's
the real Straw Hat."

186
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,221
I'm sure it's very difficult
to tell us apart.

187
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:42,290
Hey, Bon.

188
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,358
You forgot the clothes.

189
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,861
Now that I've so cleverly
drawn the Hydra's attention,

190
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:49,897
it's time for you to
get away, dear friend.

191
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:50,898
Huh?

192
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,900
[BON CLAY (LUFFY)]
Here, Hydra, Hydra, Hydra!

193
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,803
Come on! I'm waiting for you!

194
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:57,371
[BON CLAY]
I've got you now!

195
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:00,241
I said there's no escape,
and I meant it!

196
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:03,978
It got bigger!

197
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,112
Wuh-oh!

198
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,315
"Oh, Come My Surprise"!

We're still evacuating!

That Warden guy's
poisoning his own people!

[BON CLAY screaming]

206
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:26,734
The Hydra's venom is
a paralytic neurotoxin!

207
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,035
It makes its way
through your body

208
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,339
causing horrific pain
before you finally die!

209
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:36,410
It's killing me!
Give me the antidote, hurry!

210
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,679
Uhh. Boss, why?

211
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:41,415
Stay out of the way when
I'm fighting, you damned fools.

212

You got that?

[GUARD H]
W-We're terribly sorry, sir!

214
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,887
Stop chasing me!
I just wanna eat! Hungry...

215
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:49,090
How can he think about food
at a time like this?

216
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,759
Either way, you gotta respect
a man that knows what he wants.

217
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,061
I admire your bravery,
dear friend.

218
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:57,064
It just sucks that
we're both gonna die!

it's really hot!

All right!
One of the heads is gone!

224
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,482
How clever.

225
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,184
You have some of your
brother's cunning after all.

226
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,220
Still, this is the end.

What is this, tear gas?

No! It's Magellan's poison!

to fight, you bastards!

I don't know.

240
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,857
Maybe that intruder
they were talking about?

241
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:59,093
So, Hell Heat plus poison gas?

Whoa!

00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,618

00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:45,406
Could I offer you some of this?

that your death is imminent.

[GUARD K] Please, give me
the antidote! I'm dying!

267
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,895
You mean they were all
poisoned by the Warden?

268
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,830
Yeah. They got caught up
in the crossfire

269
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:18,766
between him and
that Straw Hat kid.

270
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,402
At this rate, he'll end up
poisoning all of us!

Oh, man, I hope not!

Did you hear that? Sounds like
Straw Hat's in a tough fight.

Well, too bad for him,
but good for us!

What?

275
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,048
In all the awful things
that Impel Down has to offer,

276
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,850
Warden Magellan
is by far the most deadly.

277
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,986
Right now, he's focused
on Straw Hat.

278
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,754
So, while there are
likely guards posted

279
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:44,058
at the staircase to Level 3
preventing an eventless escape,

280
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,960
at least we can
take comfort in knowing

281
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:47,928
we won't face the worst terror!

282
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:51,732

this is our chance!

I can do while my dear friend

is being subjected
to that dreadful poison!

one thing I can do.

He's fighting so hard
and you can't help him?

302

Can't you do something?

303
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:12,146
Calm down. Think this through.

Look how many guards there are

That doesn't matter.
Just think about it.

338
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,063
They assigned the more
powerful Demon Guards

to protect
the staircase to Level 5.

340
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,367
It's more important to them

341
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,271
to not let Straw Hat get down
to the lower levels.

342
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:46,608

security they have here.

00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:54,650
Once he does,
this window is closed.

347
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,686
We must get to Level 3
before that happens!

348
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,623
[BUGGY]
Actually, maybe you're right.

349
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:02,758
I've never heard anything about

350
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,062
Vice Warden Hannyabal
having any Devil Fruit powers.

351
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:11,400
If I can take out those guards
with a Muggy Ball... Heh.

352
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,703
We can do it. Hannyabal
can't be that tough, right?

353
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,073
Now you're thinking.
All right, let's do it.

354
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,175
I don't want to stay in
this heat one moment longer.

355
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,977
It's now or never.

356
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,580
[BOTH]
Ready?

357
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:27,549
[BOTH yelling, laughing]

358
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,984
[GUARDS gasping]

359
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,187
Nothing is going to stop us
from getting through!

360
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,422
That's right!

361
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,792
Vice Warden Hannyabal, look,
it's Buggy the Clown and Mr. 3!

362
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,427
Looks like they're
trying to get to Level 3!

363
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,729
We can't let those bastards
go any higher! Let's go!

364
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,331
Now, Muggy!

365
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:43,465
Candle!

366
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,100
Wait a minute!

367
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,370
Guards, stand down.

368
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:50,739
[GUARDS gasping]

369
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,474
[BUGGY, MR. 3]
Huh?!

370
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,209
Vice Warden, why?

371
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:57,546
That's right, I'm the Vice
Warden and I'm in charge here.

372
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:01,183
Yes, yes, yes!
Here's my chance.

373
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,785
It seems fortune has
finally favored me.

374
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:06,455
On top of Straw Hat
Luffy's invasion,

375
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,223
if these two managed to escape,

376
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:10,158
I'm sure the officials
wouldn't tolerate

377
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,160
this magnitude of incompetence.

378
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:13,295
[BOTH]
Huh?

379
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,563
And since he's
the one in charge,

380
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,799
they'll blame Warden Magellan
for everything that happened.

381
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,334
After that...

382
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:25,741
I will be promoted to Warden,
as I so richly deserve.

383
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:26,808
Uh, Vice Warden,

384
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:29,578
are you sure you don't
want us to stop those two?

385
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,246
--[Hannyabal laughing]
-- Please, give us an order.

386
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,248
Anything, sir!

387
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,485
Okay! Everybody move.

388
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:37,219
[GUARDS]
Huh?

389
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,087
Uhh.

390
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,555
Uh, we've been expecting you.

391
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:43,525
So please, come right this way.

392
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,093
You heard me, men! Move it!

393
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:48,263
Make way! Don't be rude
to our guests!

394
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:50,232
No way. Is he serious?

395
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:53,769
Maybe this is all part of
the Vice Warden's secret ploy.

396
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:56,772
There you are! Please,
go right on ahead.

397
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,373
[BOTH]
Uhh?

398
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,409
[BOTH growling]

399
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:01,643
[BUGGY, MR. 3]
Screw a bunch of that!

400
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,813
Can't fool us! We see right
through your sneaky little plan!

401
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,549
There is no way our escape
could be that easy!

402
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,618
You could at least
make it less obvious!

403
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:10,285
Huh?

404
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,155
Suck it, freak! Muggy Ball!

405
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,657
Take this! Candle Lock!

406
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,128
[GUARDS screaming]

407
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,869
What the hell is wrong
with you two idiots?

408
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,272
I said, you could go!

409
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,474
[BOTH grunting]

410
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:33,775
[MR. 3]
Oh, crap.

411
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,744
[BUGGY]
This isn't good.

412
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:44,486
[MAGELLAN] I suggest you put an
end to this nonsense and submit.

413
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:49,324
[panting]

414
00:21:49,358 --> 00:21:51,893
I'm gonna rescue my brother.

415
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:55,831
And we'll escape
from here together!

416
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:59,201
I won't die without
even seeing him!

417
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,441
[LUFFY] And I'm not going to let
you execute him, you hear me?

418
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,844
[MAGELLAN]
Hm? What's that smoke?

419
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:10,712
I don't have time
for your tricks.

420
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,914
[LUFFY]
I'm not getting anywhere.

421
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:16,551
I can't win
without touching you.

422
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,287
I'll make a sacrifice.

423
00:22:21,823 --> 00:22:25,627
[LUFFY] You can take
my arms, but I won't lose!

424
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:30,699
Huh? Why would I need your arms?

425
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:33,735
You want me to take you apart
piece by piece?

426
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,770
[LUFFY grunts]

427
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,441
[LUFFY]
Now, Gum-Gum!

428
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,879
Jet Bazooka!

429
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,693
[groaning]

430
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:06,001
[LUFFY groaning]

431
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,970
[LUFFY screaming]

432
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,810
[NARRATOR]
Magellan's venom proves to be

433
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:18,413
an impenetrable wall, chipping
away at Luffy's strength

434
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,849
and destroying any hope
of a counterattack.

435
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,852
With nowhere to run,
Luffy's desperation to save Ace

436
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:26,455
forces him to make
a very grim sacrifice

437
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,958
as he prepares for one final
attack against his adversary.

438
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,693
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece:

439
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,530
"The Showdown Has Come!
Luffy's Desperate Last Attack!"

440
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:37,933
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
