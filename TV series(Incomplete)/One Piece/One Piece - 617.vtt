00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.986
[laughing]

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:39.024
Now, flow into me, Land of
the Dead! Give me power!

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:44.330
[gasps]

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.699
[laughing]

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:49.068
[groans, coughs]

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.143
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.153
[laughs]

00:13:08.254 --> 00:13:14.260
[laughing]

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:24.203
Behold my full strength!
The true power of science!

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.996
[laughs]

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:56.202
[laughs]

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.873
[laughs]

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:03.709
Ha! Such power!

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:12.284
[laughing]

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:14.887
Well, take a good look,
Straw Hat Luffy.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.990
Are you still certain
you want to fight me?

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:22.061
Are you strong enough to
face the power of science?

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:24.430
This has been a very
useful demonstration.

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.799
I've already had two
countries express interest

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:29.969
in acquiring the Land
of the Dead from me.

00:14:30.002 --> 00:14:33.005
Countries that are
normally peaceful.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.374
But after learning a weapon
like this existed,

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.043
they realized they needed
to protect themselves

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:41.447
by whatever means necessary.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.184
My expertise will be in
high demand soon enough.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.486
I will fill the world
with weapons I created,

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.255
and when that's done,
I'll take my place

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.457
as the king of the
Land of the Dead!

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.327
[laughs]

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.029
Now, watch.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.698
[SUBORDINATES screaming]

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.901
[SUBORDINATE BB]
Run!

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.805
Why, Master?

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.514
[SUBORDINATE CC]
He killed our brothers!

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.649
[SUBORDINATE DD]
How could he?

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:19.184
[SUBORDINATE O]
Master!

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:22.721
Lowlife guinea pigs--
is that really all we are?

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.124
[laughs]

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:28.460
My deadly creation works
so well it amazes even me.

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:32.097
Shutting down the nervous
system almost instantaneously.

00:15:32.131 --> 00:15:33.966
It's art as well as science!

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.435
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:37.970
[MOMONOSUKE]
Uh! Impossible!

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.072
How could one man
possess such power?

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.041
Those poor people.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.350
[LUFFY]
Will you look after Brownbeard?

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:52.751
Oh, yes.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:55.754
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:56.989
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:15:57.022 --> 00:16:00.893
Hey, come back here.
We were just getting started.

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:04.563
Ha! Going to turn tail
and run after all?

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.967
How incredibly pathetic of you.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.935
It isn't going to do
you any good, though,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.203
not when the Land of the Dead

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:14.039
has practically
filled Building B.

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:15.841
There's nowhere left to run.

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:19.345
The entire island
is a deathtrap now.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:22.381
And you guinea pigs ought to
keep that in mind as well.

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.149
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.818
[laughing]

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:28.153
[SUBORDINATES scream]

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:35.694
All of you are going
to die. Right now!

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.197
Like the trash you are.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.203
[SUBORDINATE X]
Brownbead was right.

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:46.705
The Master was just using us.

00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:52.678
It's true!

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:56.315
But he... was such
a good master.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.585
Hey, I know you're
brokenhearted and all,

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:03.489
but can I take a look at that
control panel for a sec?

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:06.525
My friends are down there and
I'm not gonna let 'em die.

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:09.194
You jerk. You watched the
whole time, didn't you?

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.496
Ah! Let's kill him!

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:13.399
Kill me? I wasn't the one
who gassed your friends.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:14.433
Yeah, he's right.

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:15.934
We trusted the Master for years,

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.970
and he betrayed us
in the worst way.

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.171
What do we do now?

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:22.808
We didn't learn the truth
till it was too late.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.344
There's nowhere to run.
The whole island's toxic!

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.813
[SUBORDINATE EE] You people are
just as dead as we are though!

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.915
[SUBORDINATE FF] And your
captain stabbed you in the back!

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:31.617
Did you see him run from Caesar?

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.485
Ha-ha! Serves you right.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:37.756
He took off like a coward and
left the rest of you behind.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.725
Wait, what was that?

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:42.094
Don't tell me I just heard
you insult my captain

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.562
right in front of me.

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:45.330
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.070
[USOPP] Honestly, if he
were the type of person

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.238
who would turn tail
without a second thought,

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.674
things would probably be easier.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.246
[USOPP] There are so many times
I would've run if was up to me.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.382
Now, Third Gear!

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.685
[USOPP] But no matter
what we're up against,

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.087
he never hesitates.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.656
He never stops believing in us.

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:16.361
[USOPP] So we have no choice
but to believe in him, too.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.430
We've pledged to live
up to his expectations

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:21.266
as long as we breathe!

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.436
[SUBORDINATES screaming]

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:29.541
Uh. Master, please don't!

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.443
[laughing]

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:32.177
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:34.213
[laughs]

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.647
You people are so pathetic.

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:38.484
It's almost not worth
the effort to kill you.

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:42.187
But there are consequences for
standing against your master.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:46.258
[SUBORDINATS screaming]

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.560
[SUBORDINATE GG] This is awful.
What should we do?

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:50.529
[SUBORDINATE HH]
There isn't anything we can do.

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:53.398
There's no way we could
beat someone so strong.

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.533
[USOPP]
Yes, there is!

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.701
[ALL]
Huh?

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:59.171
Just believe in our captain,
that's all you have to do.

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:07.346
Caesar may be strong,

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:10.649
but he's the kind of person
that Luffy hates the most.

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:12.651
[SUBORDINATES]
Huh?

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:13.685
[SUBORDINATE ZF yelps]

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.488
I-I'm sorry, Master! Spare me!

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:21.460
That's right! I decide
what happens to you!

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.162
I am your master and savior,

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:24.796
and that means your
worthless lives

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.932
are mine to keep or throw away!

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:29.168
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.176
[USOPP] If anyone can make
Caesar pay, it's Luffy.

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.946
Now, Armament Hardening!

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:44.349
[yells]

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:49.321
[laughs]

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:51.123
[yells]

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:53.592
Caesar!

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:58.263
What's this?
You decided to come back?

00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:59.765
Didn't think you had it in you.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.968
I'm gonna finish you now
so I never see you again!

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:06.004
This is it! My demonstration
will have the perfect ending!

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.407
Straw Hat Luffy's death!

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:15.013
[laughs]

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.549
Now, die!

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:20.652
[LUFFY]
Gum-Gum...

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:26.458
[yelling]

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:30.629
...Grizzly Magnum!

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:39.504
[growling]

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:42.874
[laughing]

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:52.985
[CAESAR CLOWN laughs]

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.353
You're done now!

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.656
You can't stand against
the power of science!

00:20:57.689 --> 00:21:00.292
The Master of Punk Hazard
has defeated you.

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:01.860
Say goodbye!

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:05.364
[growling]

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.370
Shut up!

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:14.072
[yells]

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.050
[CAESAR CLOWN]
Huh?

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:33.025
Wait, Straw Hat,
let's make a deal.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.660
You can work under me.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:38.230
Let's calm down for
a second and talk.

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:41.166
[CAESAR CLOWN screams]

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:42.668
[CAESAR CLOWN gasps]

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:20.205
[NARRATOR] Luffy's victory
against the evil Caesar Clown

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:22.874
sends a shockwave
throughout the New World.

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.711
Shortly thereafter,
an intimidating assassin

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:29.748
sent by Doflamingo approaches
the sky above Punk Hazard,

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:33.051
signaling the beginning of a
brand-new storm of conflict.

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:35.120
[LUFFY]
On the next One Piece!

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:38.256
"Raid!
An Assassin from Dressrosa!"

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.059
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
