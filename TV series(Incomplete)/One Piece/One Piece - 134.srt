What's wrong?
What's going on here?

177
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,573
It's Dick the Bandit
and his gang!

178
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,641
They're attacking a ranch
on the outskirts of town!

179
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,509
Now let go!

Dick the Bandit?

181
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,682
[YOSAKU] Here he is.
And he's a big leaguer, too!

a lot squirreled away!

What should we do?

We can't just do nothing!

194
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,145
Well, we can't
fight him, either!

195
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,814
That's Dick the Bandit up there!

196
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,216
Better he takes our crops
instead of our lives!

197
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,018

Don't any of 'em have
the guts to do anything?

207
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,803
Guess not.

208
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,472
But maybe they're smart.

209
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,707
Maybe they know how
the world's divided.

210
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,644
There are those who take
and those who get taken from.

211
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,146
They know which group
that they belong to...

212
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,715
...and that they're fools
if they try to fight back!

I spent a lotta time on it.

You shouldn't be so reckless
with such a precious sword.

294
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,982
If it were an ordinary one,
it would have met the same fate

as those two broken ones
you brought in.

You're right. I do.

ever was, you hear me!

You did a great job.

I'd like to pay you
a little extra,

306

but unfortunately,
I'm a little broke right now.

Don't worry about it.

with such a quality
piece of steel.

310
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,599
That thing's a work of art,

311
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,034
unlike this long
sword I loaned you.

312
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,603

back in one piece.

Better make that two.

C'mon, what's your deal?
Do you have to be so rough?

You keep breaking every sword
you get your hands on!

I'm sorry.

319
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,050
I'll find some way
to pay you back.

That sounds like Dick
the Mountain Whale again.

Up to no good, as usual.

Yo, boss! We've got all the

We're ready to go when you are.

You're done?

360
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,087
I was about to
kill these losers,

361
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,023
but, now that I think about it,
they're not worth the ammo.

362
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:58,991
Let's go.

[DICK]
Hmm?

366
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,098
[JOHNNY] I said "hold it
right there," dirtbag!

367
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,902
We've turned in dozens‐‐no,
hundreds of bounties by a hair!

368
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,837
You might be bigger
and stronger than us,

369
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,839
but we're not
lettin' you get away!

370
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,242
If we did, it'd shame us
for the rest of our lives!

371
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,911
But you'd have lives.

372
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,779
You won't if you
try to take me down.

373
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,081
Is it worth it?

374
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,284
In my opinion it is,
and you know why?

375
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,418
Because...

376
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,420
...there are times
when a man has to

377
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,024

in, no matter what the odds!

We'll take that bet, scumbag!

381
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,033
Then you'll lose.

we'll put you

the kid to do. Think.

You've gotten stronger,

while the strength of
the swords hasn't changed.

450
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,285
As a result, the swords
have been breaking.

451
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,255
Like the swordsmith said,
you've got to be more careful.

452
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,223
The trick is getting the
most out of each sword

453
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,791
without overdoing it.

454
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,262
Focus, know the steel's
strength, and then strike.

what kind of reputation
you have, Zoro,

458
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,870
or the fact that you
fight with three swords!

459
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:32,938
Even with them,

460
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,607
you won't be able to defeat
that many men at once!

462
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,778

isn't the same...

524
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:12,157
<i>With friends and family...</i>
<i>Who'd pick me up...</i>

525
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,263
[ZORO]
Hey, Luffy.

526
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,264
[LUFFY]
Yeah?

527
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,265
[ZORO] Let's hurry and
get off this island.

528
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,033
I can't shake the feeling
there's going to be

529
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,835
nothing but trouble for us here.

530
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,438
I get the same sense from that
old‐timer that I get from you.

531
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,840
[LUFFY] You've got nothing
to worry about if he's like me!

532
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,674
[LUFFY laughs]

533
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,343
[ZORO]
That's exactly why I'm worried!

534
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,477
[LUFFY]
Oh, yeah?

535
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,112
On the next One Piece!

536
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,847
"Zenny of the Island of Goats

537
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,949
and the Pirate Ship
in the Mountains!"

538
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,519
I'm gonna be
King of the Pirates!
