WITH YU-GI-OH 5D'S!

00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:06.153
Akiza: WHERE ARE YOU, MISTY?

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:09.171
Misty: GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT,
BLACK ROSE.

00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:10.912
COME ON IN.

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:15.243
WELCOME TO MY HALL OF MIRRORS.

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:18.051
I WAS HOPING
WE COULD REFLECT ON THE PAST.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:18.969
AH!

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.072
THERE'S NO GOING BACK, AKIZA.

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:23.742
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEAL
THE CONTROL TOWER

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:26.528
SO THAT YOU CAN PLAY
GOODIE-TWO-SHOES
AND SAVE THE WORLD,

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:29.662
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH
MY LITTLE MAZE.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.007
YOU DON'T SCARE ME,
MISTY. BRING IT!

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.062
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:38.939
AKIZA! MINA! HUH?

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.107
MINA?

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.042
MINA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.443
HUH?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.614
PSYCHIC SWORD!

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.349
NO WAY!

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.651
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC DUELIST?

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.085
YES!

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.354
AND I CAN SEE THAT
YOUR FUTURE IS GONNA
GET CUT SHORT.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.323
HA HA!

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:00.060
YOU SEE EVERY SAD STORY
NEEDS A GUT-WRENCHING CLIMAX

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.129
FULL OF HEARTBREAK
AND LOSS.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.233
SO I'M ACTIVATING
THE ATROCIOUS DAY
SPELL CARD FROM MY HAND.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.036
REMEMBER WHEN YOU LOST CONTROL
AND TORE UP DOWNTOWN DOMINO?

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.205
TOBY WENT TO SEE
YOU DUEL THAT DAY...

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.641
AND I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.417
UH! ARGH!

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.118
Agent: AKIZA IS DESTINED
FOR GREATNESS.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:28.121
SHE CAN'T BE WASTING HER TIME
WITH YOU.

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.489
HOPE YOU CAN SWIM.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.259
THIS IS BAD.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.028
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SAYER
WOULD LIE TO ME,

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.196
BUT IF IT'S TRUE...

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.098
IF I HURT HER BROTHER...

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.533
WHO ELSE COULD
I HAVE HURT?

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.702
AH!

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.170
AH!

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.238
OH!

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:46.607
IT'S ME, AKIZA.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.175
SAYER!

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.576
WHEN YOU FIRST
CAME TO ME,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.711
I COULD SENSE
THAT YOUR TRUE POWER

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.412
WAS TOO MUCH
FOR YOU TO HANDLE.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.416
BUT YOUR TRUE POWER
CAN BE AWOKEN WITH
ONE LITTLE SENTENCE.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.718
AKIZA, DID YOU HEAR?

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.353

TO THE NETHERWORLD

UH-OH, THAT ATTACK
WAS LIKE REAL.

AND THAT MEANS AKIZA'S
USING HER PSYCHIC POWERS
AGAIN!

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.396
IT'S YOUR MOVE MISTY.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.001
THAT POWER YOU POSSESS,

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:57.270
THAT'S WHY MY BROTHER
WENT LOOKING FOR YOU...

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.106
AND I'M SURE THAT'S WHY
HE WENT MISSING.

THESE DARK SIGNERS LEARN

THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL
THE UNCONTROLLABLE?

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.301
NOW EDUCATE THEM, AKIZA!

HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH
HER MISSING BROTHER.

OUT TO GET HER.

OF MY SAD STORY SPELL COMBO,

MY DECK AND THEN RESHUFFLED.

IN ORDER TO CALL
A MONSTER TO THE FIELD

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.595

MY SORROWFUL MEMORIES SPELL

AND BRING OUT MY DRAGON QUEEN

OF MY DRAGON QUEEN IN PLAY,

AND NEXT I REMOVE
ROSE FAIRY IN MY
GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY,

00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:23.087

SPECIAL ABILITY.

THAT WAS QUITE
THE TRAGIC ENDING
FOR YOUR DRAGON,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.665
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO LOSE.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.838
THE ONLY ONE LOSING ANYTHING
AROUND HERE IS YOUR
BLACK ROSE DRAGON.

00:08:13.838 --> 00:08:16.073
YOU SEE, BY REMOVING
MY REPTILLIANNE ANGER
FROM THE GAME,

00:08:16.073 --> 00:08:20.344
YOUR BEAST LOSES
800 ATTACK POINTS.

00:08:20.344 --> 00:08:23.581
WELL, THEN, I HAD
BETTER PLANT MYSELF
A LITTLE DEFENSE!

00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:29.520
AND NOW THAT I HAVE
MY DARK VERGER IN PLACE,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.290
I'LL TURN IT OVER
TO YOU.

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:36.360
COME ON, AKIZA.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.896
YOU HAVE TO FOCUS
AND END THIS BEFORE...

00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:41.432
BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

00:08:41.432 --> 00:08:45.303
WHY ARE YOU HERE, SAYER?
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH AKIZA?

00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:46.637
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.
I WANT REVENGE

00:08:46.637 --> 00:08:49.073
FOR WHAT THE DARK
SIGNERS DID TO ME

00:08:49.073 --> 00:08:51.042
AND THE
ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:54.712

TO MAKE THAT REVENGE
POSSIBLE.

MY EVERY ORDER

OUT OF THIS, SAYER!

DID YOU SAY "THROUGH,"

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:14.632
SHE'S THROUGH
WITH NOTHING
UNTIL I SAY SHE IS.

00:09:14.632 --> 00:09:15.966
AND I'M NEVER
LETTING HER GO!

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:17.501
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:09:21.272 --> 00:09:22.606
ARGH!

00:09:22.606 --> 00:09:24.909
DON'T YOU SEE THAT
CONTROLLING PEOPLE IS WRONG?

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:26.410
SOME PEOPLE
NEED DIRECTION

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.080
SO THEY DON'T HURT
OTHERS OR THEMSELVES,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.248
AND AKIZA HAS ALWAYS
NEEDED SOMEONE
TO GUIDE HER

00:09:31.282 --> 00:09:33.984
TO HELP KEEP CALM
AND FOCUSED...

00:09:33.984 --> 00:09:36.387
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE IS
UNDER MY CONTROL,

00:09:36.387 --> 00:09:39.056
IT IS BECAUSE OF ME
THAT SHE WILL FINALLY
BE FREE

00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:41.659
TO UNLEASH
ALL HER TRUE POWERS,

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:44.729
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
WHICH YOU COULD NEVER
GIVE HER.

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:46.397
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

00:09:46.397 --> 00:09:47.732
NO, BUT THIS ONE
OVER HERE IS.

00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:51.535
THIS MISTY INDIVIDUAL
HAS LET THE HATE
SHE HAS FOR AKIZA

00:09:51.535 --> 00:09:54.338
CLOUD HER ABILITY
TO THINK CLEARLY.

00:09:54.338 --> 00:09:56.674
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE
ENTER INTO A SHADOW DUEL

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:59.810
WITH A PSYCHIC DUELIST
WHERE THE OUTCOME
IS CERTAIN DEFEAT?

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.645
AND ALL OF THIS TO
FIND OUT THE TRUTH

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:03.948
ABOUT HER LITTLE
BROTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE.

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:05.049
HUH?

00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:06.617
THERE AREN'T
MANY SOLID LEADS

00:10:06.617 --> 00:10:08.419
ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF MISTY'S BROTHER.

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:10.588
IN FACT, THERE IS
WIDE SPECULATION

00:10:10.588 --> 00:10:12.957
THAT THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDING
FALSE INFORMATION

00:10:12.957 --> 00:10:14.825
TO THE INVESTIGATORS.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:19.563
SO IT WAS YOUR LIES
THAT DROVE MISTY TO
BECOME A DARK SIGNER.

00:10:19.563 --> 00:10:23.401
MISTY CHOSE TO BELIEVE
WHAT SHE WANTED
TO BELIEVE.

00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:25.503
SHE WANTED AN ANSWER,
ANY ANSWER.

00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:27.772
AND IN THE END
THE ANSWER SHE
CHOSE TO BELIEVE

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:30.007
WAS THAT AKIZA
WAS TO BLAME.

00:10:30.007 --> 00:10:31.409
TO BLAME?

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:32.843
I THINK WE KNOW
WHO'S TO BLAME.

00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:35.646
OR ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE
TO LIVE A LIFE OF LIES?

00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:37.848
HUH?

00:10:37.848 --> 00:10:38.883
YOU'RE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE

00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:40.451
FOR MISTY'S BROTHER'S
DISAPPEARANCE.

00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:43.421
IF SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:51.061
IT'S MY MOVE, AKIZA!

00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:54.498
AND I SUMMON REPTILIANNE
GARDNA IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:56.567 --> 00:11:00.237
NEXT I'LL REMOVE
THE CONTINUOUS SPELL SAD STORY

00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:02.006
UNWAVERING TRUTH
FROM THE FIELD

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:05.509
SO THAT I CAN BRING
BACK DRAGON QUEEN
OF TRAGIC ENDINGS

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:07.711
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:11:09.747 --> 00:11:12.716
NOW AS LONG AS I HAVE
A CONTINUOUS SPELL ON MY FIELD,

00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:14.685
IF MY DRAGON QUEEN
GETS DESTROYED,

00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:17.254
I CAN BRING IT BACK
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:11:17.288 --> 00:11:19.690
TOO BAD YOUR BLACK ROSE
DRAGON WON'T BE AROUND

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.892
TO WITNESS
ITS AMAZING ABILITY!

00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:24.428
GO TRAGEDY STREAM!

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:31.402
AND SINCE I SUCCESSFULLY
DESTROYED YOUR PATHETIC BEAST,

00:11:31.402 --> 00:11:34.338
I CAN NOW ACTIVATE MY DRAGON
QUEEN'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:36.407
WHICH FORCES YOU TO SELECT
ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND

00:11:36.407 --> 00:11:39.243
AND SEND IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:39.276 --> 00:11:43.280
NOW THAT THAT'S DONE,
I GET TO DRAW ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:45.649
HMM.
YOU'RE UP AKIZA.

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:48.452
YES, I AM.

00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:53.757
AND I'LL BET
THIS NEXT MOVE'S
GONNA BLOW YOU AWAY.

00:11:53.757 --> 00:11:56.460
BY DESTROYING
MY DARK VERGER

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.531
WHILE FRAGRANCE STORM
IS IN PLAY, I CAN DRAW
A CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:12:00.531 --> 00:12:03.868
NOW IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH
TO ACTUALLY PICK ANOTHER
PLANT-TYPE MONSTER,

00:12:03.868 --> 00:12:06.537
ALL I NEED TO DO
IS SHOW YOU THE CARD
I SELECTED

00:12:06.537 --> 00:12:08.205
AND I GET A BONUS DRAW.

00:12:08.205 --> 00:12:09.206
HUH?

00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:11.642
SO I GUESS
I'LL PICK A CARD.

00:12:11.642 --> 00:12:13.611
AND NEXT I'M SUMMONING
COPY PLANT

00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:15.779
TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:20.985
AND SINCE I PLAYED
A PLANT-TYPE TUNER
MONSTER,

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:24.722
I GET TO BRING BACK
MY DARK VERGER
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.061
PLAY ALL THE WEEDS
YOU WANT, AKIZA,

00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:32.496
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
MOW THEM DOWN

00:12:32.496 --> 00:12:35.699
ALONG WITH THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:12:56.326 --> 00:12:57.327
LEO! LUNA!

00:12:57.327 --> 00:13:00.397
ARE YOU OK?

00:13:00.397 --> 00:13:01.631
YEAH.

00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.632
SO HOW'S THE DUEL GOING?

00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:05.335
AKIZA'S WINNING
RIGHT NOW.

00:13:05.335 --> 00:13:08.472
BUT SHE'S NOT
ACTING LIKE HER
NORMAL SELF.

00:13:08.472 --> 00:13:11.108
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN

00:13:11.108 --> 00:13:13.376
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:15.278
THEN IT'S MY MOVE,
AKIZA.

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:17.948
I DRAW.

00:13:17.948 --> 00:13:19.783
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:23.520
FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL ADVANCE FORCE!

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.089
DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF THIS CARD,

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:28.058
DRAGON QUEEN
OF TRAGIC ENDINGS

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.961
COUNTS AS TWO MONSTERS
WHEN IT'S SACRIFICED!

00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:32.963
AND THAT LETS ME SUMMON
OUT THIS LITTLE GUY!

00:13:32.963 --> 00:13:37.334
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR
THE NETHERWORLD, AKIZA!

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:41.004
COME FORTH,
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CCARAYHUA!

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.909
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD,
CAN IT?

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:46.910
NO, LEO, IT CAN'T.

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.260
HA!

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.028
AAH!
AH!

00:14:06.897 --> 00:14:09.065
[ROAR]

00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:13.436
UH!

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.138
ARGH...

00:14:15.138 --> 00:14:19.242
I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH
ABOUT MISTY'S BROTHER,
SAYER!

00:14:19.242 --> 00:14:20.777
HMM...

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.979
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING HIM
HIDDEN FROM MISTY

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:26.850
AND WHY DID YOU TELL
THE INVESTIGATORS THAT
AKIZA WAS RESPONSIBLE?

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.085
I COULDN'T JEOPARDIZE MY WORK
WITH THE MOVEMENT.

00:14:29.085 --> 00:14:33.356
AND AKIZA'S TROUBLED PAST
MADE HER THE PERFECT SCAPEGOAT.

00:14:33.356 --> 00:14:36.059
I REMEMBER IT
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY!

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.632
SAYER, THE BOYS'
ELECTRO-STATIC FORCE FIELD

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.367
IS NOT REACHING THE LEVELS
YOU REQUESTED.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.303
GIVE HIM SOME TIME!

00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:47.971
BUT, SIR, WE'VE BEEN
AT THIS FOR HOURS.

00:14:51.208 --> 00:14:53.176
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GUESS THAT TOBY'S POTENTIAL

00:14:53.176 --> 00:14:56.246
ISN'T QUITE WHAT WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NOW, IS IT?

00:14:56.246 --> 00:14:58.582
SHIP THE SUBJECT OFF
WITH THE OTHER FAILURES.

00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:00.817
NOW!

00:15:01.952 --> 00:15:04.254
TOBY'S TELEKINETIC ABILITIES
WERE PATHETIC.

00:15:04.254 --> 00:15:07.090
HE DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE
TO MEETING THE HIGH STANDARDS

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.559
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
REQUIRED.

00:15:09.559 --> 00:15:12.796
AKIZA, HOWEVER, WAS ONE
OF MY GREATEST FINDS.

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.564
HER POWERS WERE AS STRONG
AS SHE WAS NAIVE.

00:15:14.564 --> 00:15:17.267
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS!

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.769
YOU'RE THROUGH
RUINING LIVES!

00:15:19.769 --> 00:15:21.004
AH...

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.907
I'M JUST
GETTING STARTED.

00:15:23.907 --> 00:15:28.178
HUH? AH! OH!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.179
ARGH!

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.781
HA HA.
STILL HANGING,
ON ARE WE?

00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:35.151
WELL, ITS TIME I PUT
AN END TO THAT!

00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:36.920
IF YOU THOUGHT AKIZA
WAS POWERFUL,

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.888
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT I CAN DO!

00:15:38.888 --> 00:15:40.090
HA HA!

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.091
HUH? WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.893
I'M LAUGHING
AT YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS

00:15:43.893 --> 00:15:45.862
AND HOW THEY NEVER
PICKED UP ON THE FACT

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:49.165
THAT OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION
IS BEING BROADCAST TO MISTY.

00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:51.101
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:53.336
BEFORE YOU STARTED
BLABBING TO ME,

00:15:53.336 --> 00:15:56.640
I ENABLED THE LIVE FEED
FUNCTION ON OUR DUEL DISKS.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.442
AH.

00:15:59.442 --> 00:16:01.077
NOW THAT I KNOW
THE TRUTH...

00:16:01.077 --> 00:16:03.113
NOW THAT I KNOW
IT WAS YOU...

00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:05.081
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE
MY BROTHER IS!

00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:08.918
YOUR BROTHER'S BEEN SENT
TO A SECRET LOCATION,

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:11.521
THE COORDINATES OF WHICH
ARE EVER CHANGING.

00:16:11.521 --> 00:16:14.424
IN FACT, EVEN I
DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

00:16:14.424 --> 00:16:17.994
IN THAT CASE, YOU'RE NOT
WORTH ANYTHING TO ME.

00:16:17.994 --> 00:16:19.963
SO PREPARE YOURSELF
FOR THE NETHERWORLD.

00:16:35.134 --> 00:16:36.736
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:39.472
TO SEND ME TO
THE NETHERWORLD,
MISTY?

00:16:39.472 --> 00:16:42.709
NO, BUT MY EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL IS.

00:16:44.043 --> 00:16:46.779
AAH!

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:47.847
HUH?

00:16:47.847 --> 00:16:49.482
AH!
AH!

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:57.388
UM, GUYS, SAYER, JUST, LIKE,
DISAPPEARED INTO THAT THING?

00:16:57.388 --> 00:17:01.459
DEAR BROTHER,
I KNOW YOU'RE OUT
THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:04.495
FORGIVE ME, AKIZA.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.865
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:10.168
I AM SO SORRY FOR BLAMING YOU
FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

00:17:10.168 --> 00:17:13.337
HUH?

00:17:13.337 --> 00:17:15.072
PERHAPS BY FORFEITING
THIS DUEL,

00:17:15.072 --> 00:17:17.074
YOU WILL SEE
THAT I AM SINCERE.

00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:20.011
AND THEN MAYBE YOU WILL
FIND IT IN YOUR HEART

00:17:20.011 --> 00:17:22.447
TO CONTINUE MY QUEST
TO FIND MY BROTHER.

00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:25.483
Evil God: I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU
TO END THIS DUEL.

00:17:25.483 --> 00:17:27.351
AH! AH!

00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:28.486
THE DARKNESS...

00:17:28.486 --> 00:17:31.656
THE DARKNESS CONTROLLING ME
IS TOO POWERFUL...

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:37.028
Evil God: YOU MUST DEFEAT HER,
YOU MUST DEFEAT THE SIGNER.

00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:38.329
MISTY!

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:40.164
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THE
DARKNESS INSIDE OF YOU!

00:17:40.164 --> 00:17:43.301
AKIZA, SAYER'S NO LONGER
CONTROLLING YOU.

00:17:43.301 --> 00:17:44.602
AKIZA!

00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:46.637
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

00:17:46.637 --> 00:17:49.240
THAT'S YUSEI
CALLING OUT TO ME.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.242
Misty: AKIZA!

00:17:51.242 --> 00:17:53.678
I CAN NO LONGER STOP THIS DUEL
WITH MY OWN WILL.

00:17:53.678 --> 00:17:56.647
THE DARKNESS IS TOO STRONG.

00:17:56.647 --> 00:17:58.249
DON'T GIVE IN!

00:17:58.249 --> 00:18:00.485
FIGHT IT, MISTY.
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT IT FOR TOBY!

00:18:00.485 --> 00:18:03.387
IT'S TOO POWERFUL.

00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:06.424
AH! AKIZA, YOU HAVE
TO DEFEAT ME.

00:18:06.424 --> 00:18:09.193
I CAN'T FIGHT IT
ANY LONGER.

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:11.529
SO INSTEAD I THINK
I'LL FIGHT YOU, SIGNER,

00:18:11.529 --> 00:18:13.064
AND SEND YOU
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:18:13.064 --> 00:18:17.034
OH, NO, THE DARKNESS
HAS TAKEN OVER HER.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:18.202
AKIZA!

00:18:18.202 --> 00:18:19.470
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.172
YOU HAVE TO FINISH
THIS DUEL!

00:18:21.172 --> 00:18:22.173
I'LL DO IT.

00:18:22.173 --> 00:18:24.575
YOU'LL DO NOTHING
BUT LOSE!

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:27.044
NOW ATTACK!

00:18:27.044 --> 00:18:30.014
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
GROUND CAPTURE!

00:18:32.483 --> 00:18:36.454
WITH THIS IN PLAY,
THE DAMAGE THAT I WOULD
HAVE TAKEN IS HALVED.

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:39.690
AH!

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.292
AKIZA, NO!

00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:43.327
DON'T WORRY, YUSEI.

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:47.098
I MIGHT BE DOWN,
BUT DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF MY TRAP CARD,

00:18:47.098 --> 00:18:49.066
I AM DEFINITELY NOT OUT.

00:18:49.066 --> 00:18:52.904
IN FACT, I GET TO DRAW
A NEW CARD!

00:18:52.937 --> 00:18:55.439
WITH ONLY 200
LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:18:55.439 --> 00:18:57.608
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT CARD
YOU DREW, AKIZA.

00:18:57.608 --> 00:18:59.610
IN FACT, I'M
SO SURE OF THAT

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.413
FACT THAT I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:19:02.413 --> 00:19:04.215
IF I WIN THIS DUEL,

00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:05.983
THEN MISTY WILL BE SENT
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:08.352
BUT IF CAN I DESTROY
THAT EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL,

00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:12.223
MAYBE I CAN DESTROY THE
DARKNESS AND FREE HER.

00:19:12.223 --> 00:19:14.025
I'M UP!

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.599
DUE TO COPY PLANT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:23.501
IT BECOMES
THE SAME LEVEL
AS MY DARK VERGER

00:19:23.501 --> 00:19:25.469
UNTIL THE ROUND'S OVER!

00:19:25.469 --> 00:19:29.540
NEXT I'M SUMMONING
HEDGE GUARD TO THE
FIELD IN ATTACK MODE!

00:19:31.475 --> 00:19:33.411
Duel Runner Computer:
HEDGE GUARD IS A LEVEL 3

00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:35.446
EARTH ATTRIBUTE PLANT TYPE
MONSTER

00:19:35.446 --> 00:19:39.116
WITH ZERO ATTACK POINTS
AND 2,100 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:19:39.116 --> 00:19:41.118
NOW THAT MY GUARD'S
IN PLACE,

00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:43.487
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
SHINING REBIRTH!

00:19:43.487 --> 00:19:46.457
WITH THIS IN PLAY,

00:19:46.457 --> 00:19:48.426
BY SENDING THE REQUIRED
MONSTERS ON THE FIELD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:19:48.426 --> 00:19:52.530
I CAN SYNCHRO SUMMON
A SYNCHRO MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.700
SO I SEND LEVEL 2
DARK VERGER,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.134
LEVEL 3 HEDGE GUARD,
AND THE NOW LEVEL 2
COPY PLANT

00:19:57.134 --> 00:20:00.671
TO THE GRAVEYARD
IN ORDER TO
SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:02.907
YOUR IMMORTAL'S
DESTRUCTION!

00:20:08.045 --> 00:20:11.248
NOW COME FORTH,
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:19.490
WHEN BLACK ROSE DRAGON
IS SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.195
IT CAN DESTROY ALL CARDS
ON THE FIELD.

00:20:24.195 --> 00:20:26.597
AND DUE TO THE EFFECT
OF SHINING REBIRTH,

00:20:26.597 --> 00:20:30.401
BLACK ROSE DRAGON CANNOT
BE DESTROYED THIS TURN.

00:20:30.401 --> 00:20:33.137
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:20:33.137 --> 00:20:35.039
BECAUSE BY DEFEATING ME,
YOU'RE DEFEATING MISTY.

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:38.142
I'M NOT GOING AFTER
MISTY'S LIFE POINTS!

00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:41.045
I ACTIVATE MY DRAGONS
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:45.149
NOW TAKE OUT EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL CCARAYHUA!

00:20:48.219 --> 00:20:50.154
YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT
YOU'VE OUTSMARTED ME.

00:20:50.154 --> 00:20:53.457
WELL, NOTHING CAN BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH

00:20:53.457 --> 00:20:54.458
AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SEE WHY.

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:58.462
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP CARD
DOOM GAZER!

00:20:58.462 --> 00:21:02.166
WITH THIS CARD, WHEN AN EFFECT
THAT DESTROYS A CARD ON
THE FIELD IS ACTIVATED,

00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:06.370
FOR EVERY CARD DESTROYED
AND SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.275
YOU TAKE 300 POINTS
OF DAMAGE.

00:21:11.275 --> 00:21:13.878
SO WITH 7 CARDS DESTROYED,
AKIZA,

00:21:13.911 --> 00:21:16.380
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE THE LAST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.983
THIS MATCH IS OVER!

00:21:18.983 --> 00:21:22.053
AKIZA, LISTEN.
YOU OWE IT TO THE SIGNERS.

00:21:22.053 --> 00:21:24.321
YOU MUST KEEP FIGHTING.

00:21:24.321 --> 00:21:26.991
ARE YOU SURE?

00:21:26.991 --> 00:21:29.126
SAVE YOURSELF.
IT'S OK.

00:21:29.126 --> 00:21:34.398
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD,
NATURE'S REFLECTION,

00:21:34.398 --> 00:21:37.268
AND WITH IT
I CAN REFLECT
YOUR CARDS EFFECT.

00:21:39.103 --> 00:21:41.672
THIS CANNOT BE! AH!

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:49.480
IF YOU EVER FIND MY BROTHER,
THEN TELL HIM...

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.016
HIS BIG SISTER LOVES HIM.

00:22:00.157 --> 00:22:03.060
[ROARING]

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.345
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:22:21.345 --> 00:22:22.847
AKIZA!

00:22:22.847 --> 00:22:24.014
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!

00:22:27.518 --> 00:22:30.187
AKIZA, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.133
TOBY...

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:45.669
I'M SORRY I BRUSHED YOU OFF
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:48.939
I PROMISE TO MAKE UP
FOR IT.

00:22:48.939 --> 00:22:51.675
AKIZA...

00:22:51.675 --> 00:22:53.477
HEY EVERYBODY,
CHECK OUT THE SUN.

00:22:53.477 --> 00:22:55.146
WE'RE TOO LATE!

00:22:55.146 --> 00:22:57.081
ITS SETTING,
AND THE LAST TOWER
HASN'T BEEN SEALED.

00:22:57.081 --> 00:23:00.518
AT LEAST
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT WERE ABSORBED

00:23:00.518 --> 00:23:03.420
BY THAT EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL HAVE BEEN
RETURNED RIGHT?

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:08.492
WHOA!
ARE WE BACK HOME?!

00:23:08.492 --> 00:23:11.095
SURE LOOKS LIKE IT.

00:23:11.095 --> 00:23:12.863
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MADE IT.

00:23:12.863 --> 00:23:15.666
[RUMBLING]

00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:18.235
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHY IS THE EARTH SHAKING?

00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:21.472
LOOK OVER THERE,
EVERYONE.

00:23:21.472 --> 00:23:24.508
ITS COMING FROM
NEW DOMINO CITY!

00:23:24.508 --> 00:23:28.546
ANOTHER DARK SIGNER?
BUT WHO COULD IT BE?

00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:30.614
I DON'T KNOW, YUSEI,

00:23:30.614 --> 00:23:32.416
BUT I HAVE A FEELING
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
