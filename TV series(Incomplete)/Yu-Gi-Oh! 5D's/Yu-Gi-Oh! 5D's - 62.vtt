00:11:15.662 --> 00:11:17.664
I SUMMON BLACKWING...
MISTRAL THE SILVER SHIELD

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:19.332
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:24.404
AND WHEN A BLACKWING'S OUT,

00:11:24.404 --> 00:11:26.907
I CAN SUMMON SOMETHING
ELSE FROM MY HAND...

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:29.376
SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA
REALLY GIVE ME A SERIOUS EDGE,

00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:31.545
AND A SHARP EDGE AT THAT.

00:11:31.545 --> 00:11:33.580
I SUMMON BLACKWING...
BORA THE SPEAR!

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.951
I THEN PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.687
WHICH MEANS YOU GET
TO DEAL WITH ME NOW.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.059
AND I'LL START
BY CALLING OUT
MAD ARCHFIEND.

00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:51.631
NEXT I'LL THROW
A FACEDOWN AND
CALL IT A TURN.

00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:54.000
ALL RIGHT. I'M UP

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.536
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO DOWN

00:11:56.536 --> 00:11:57.971
'CAUSE GUESS WHAT.

00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:00.440
WHATEVER YOU'RE PLANNING
AIN'T GONNA BE HAPPENING.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.309
OH, YES, IT WILL.

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.878
IT'S BEEN IN THE MAKINGS
FOR 17 YEARS,

00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:06.746
NOT THAT I KNEW
IT BACK THEN.

00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:10.784
YOU SEE, BEFORE
MY BROTHER ROMAN RELEASED
THE POWER OF ENER-D,

00:12:10.784 --> 00:12:13.453
HE GAVE ME THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON HEAD

00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:16.756
AND EXPLAINED
THAT EVERY 5,000 YEARS,
THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:17.891
AND THE KING OF
THE NETHERWORLD
DO BATTLE...

00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:19.659
LIGHT VERSUS DARKNESS.

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:23.930
AND THIS TIME, MY BROTHER'S
BODY WAS THE BATTLEGROUND.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.533
TWO MARKS... ONE
SYMBOLIZING EACH

00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:27.801
EMBEDDED THEMSELVES
IN HIS FLESH.

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:30.604
BUT THE DARK SIGNER
MARK SOON BEGAN
TO TAKE CONTROL

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:32.405
OF MY BROTHER.

00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:33.940
SOON HE WAS SWALLOWED
BY ITS POWER,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.709
BUT NOT ENTIRELY.

00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:38.612
ROMAN STILL UNDERSTOOD
THE IMPORTANCE OF
THE DARKNESS BEING KEPT

00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:40.013
IN CHECK BY THE LIGHT

00:12:40.013 --> 00:12:42.916
SO HE WENT TO GREAT
LENGTHS TO EXPUNGE
THE LIGHT

00:12:42.916 --> 00:12:46.620
FROM HIS SYSTEM
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE
HE COULD TRUST... ME.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.956
Roman: TAKE THIS.
TAKE THIS AND RUN!

00:12:49.956 --> 00:12:52.025
WHAT IS IN
THIS CAPSULE?

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:54.794
THE KEY TO
THE WORLD'S SURVIVAL.

00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:57.898
GOOD AND EVIL WERE
BATTLING WITHIN
ME, BROTHER.

00:12:57.898 --> 00:13:00.033
AND I CHOSE
THE PATH OF DARKNESS.

00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:02.969
GATHER THE 4 SIGNERS,
THEN COME BACK
AND DEFEAT ME!

00:13:02.969 --> 00:13:04.871
Goodwin, voice-over:
AND WITH THAT,

00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:09.509
HE UNLEASHED THE POWER
OF THE ENER-D REACTOR.

00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:14.414
SOON AFTER, I DID AS
MY BROTHER ASKED AND
PREPARED TO FIGHT THE DARKNESS

00:13:14.414 --> 00:13:18.218
BY GATHERING YOU SIGNERS.

00:13:18.218 --> 00:13:22.622
AND THEN, AS HE SO CHARGED,
I CHALLENGED HIM TO A DUEL,

00:13:22.622 --> 00:13:24.958
THE LIGHT AGAINST THE DARK,

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.528
THE GOOD AGAINST THE WICKED.

00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:29.996
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:31.932
I LOST.

00:13:43.543 --> 00:13:46.046
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE BEATEN ME
WITH THOSE CARDS.

00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:49.382
YOU THREW THE MATCH.
BUT WHY? WHY?

00:13:49.382 --> 00:13:51.918
I HAVE MY REASONS,
ROMAN. BELIEVE ME.

00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:53.687
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:58.625
I MEAN THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO BEAT YUSEI FUDO.

00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:00.627
WHAT KIND OF
REASON IS THAT?

00:14:00.627 --> 00:14:02.228
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,
BROTHER?

00:14:02.262 --> 00:14:05.065
THE LIGHT WILL
TRIUMPH OVER DARKNESS.

00:14:05.065 --> 00:14:06.399
AND THEN 5,000 YEARS
FROM NOW,

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:10.370
NEW SIGNERS
AND DARK SIGNERS
WILL BE CHOSEN

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.906
AND THEY'LL DO BATTLE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:15.241
THE CYCLE IS
NEVER ENDING!

00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:18.878
BUT NOW THAT I'VE
LOST THIS DUEL,

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:20.580
THAT ALL CHANGES.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.182
CHANGES HOW?

00:14:22.182 --> 00:14:23.950
BECAUSE NOW THAT
I'VE LOST,

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.885
I WILL BE REBORN
AS A DARK SIGNER

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:29.522
A DARK SIGNER WHO HAS
THE MARK OF A SIGNER.

00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:31.758
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS,
BROTHER?

00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:33.693
THE POWER
I'LL POSSESS?

00:14:33.693 --> 00:14:34.794
YOU'VE GONE MAD.

00:14:34.794 --> 00:14:37.731
SOON I'LL HAVE ALL
THE STRENGTH AND MIGHT

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:39.933
OF BOTH THE LIGHT
AND THE DARKNESS.

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:41.835
PERHAPS YOU WERE
NOT ABLE TO TAKE ON
THESE TWO FORCES

00:14:41.835 --> 00:14:44.437
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:14:44.437 --> 00:14:47.540
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
BROTHER, I AM UP
TO THE TASK.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.309
AND THEN THERE
WILL BE A NEW VICTOR

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:51.444
IN THE BATTLE BETWEEN
GOOD AND EVIL.

00:14:51.444 --> 00:14:52.445
NO, REX!

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.252
IT'S TOO LATE.
IT'S ALREADY STARTING!

00:15:01.721 --> 00:15:04.357
Goodwin: SO NOW YOU
FINALLY UNDERSTAND.

00:15:04.357 --> 00:15:07.227
WITH THE POWER
I'VE BEEN GIVEN
AS A DARK SIGNER,

00:15:07.227 --> 00:15:08.828
I'LL HAVE THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD
LAY WASTE

00:15:08.828 --> 00:15:11.631
TO ALL THAT THERE IS!

00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:13.299
THEN WITH THE POWER
OF THE LIGHT,

00:15:13.299 --> 00:15:16.436
I CAN HAVE
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
REBUILD THE WORLD

00:15:16.436 --> 00:15:18.838
IN MY IMAGE
FOR ME TO RULE!

00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:21.541
YOU'VE LOST IT.

00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:23.343
WAIT A SECOND.
LAY WASTE TO ALL
THAT THERE IS?

00:15:23.343 --> 00:15:25.879
SO THEN
YOU'RE PLANNING
ON DESTROYING

00:15:25.879 --> 00:15:27.514
EVERYONE AND
EVERYTHING ON EARTH?

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:29.916
SORRY, MR. WOULD-BE
WORLD DOMINATOR,

00:15:29.916 --> 00:15:31.051
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:15:31.051 --> 00:15:33.953
Yusei:
THAT'S RIGHT, GOODWIN!

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:36.723
YOU MAY HAVE THE POWER
OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
ON YOUR SIDE,

00:15:36.723 --> 00:15:39.059
BUT WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
EVEN STRONGER,

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:40.894
AND IT'S SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE!

00:15:40.894 --> 00:15:44.330
HA. AND TELL ME,
WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.900
IT'S THE POWER YOU
GET FOR FIGHTING
FOR WHAT'S RIGHT!

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:56.576
NOW, THEN
I'M SUMMONING
MAX WARRIOR

00:15:56.576 --> 00:15:58.678
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:00.547 --> 00:16:03.583
THEN I'LL THROW
A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.518
FINALLY, THEN
IT'S TIME

00:16:05.518 --> 00:16:09.222
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER
OF BOTH LIGHT AND DARK.

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.527
FIRST, SINCE THERE
ARE MONSTERS ON YOUR
FIELD BUT NONE ON MINE,

00:16:14.527 --> 00:16:17.764
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON FORTH
ORACLE OF THE SUN

00:16:17.764 --> 00:16:21.901
ONTO THE FIELD.

00:16:21.901 --> 00:16:23.803
AND THEN I'LL FOLLOW
THAT BY SUMMONING

00:16:23.803 --> 00:16:27.006
THE TUNER MONSTER
FIRE ANT ASCATOR!

00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:31.611
A TUNER MONSTER?

00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.280
NOT GOOD!

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.882
YES, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
COMING, DON'T YOU?

00:16:35.882 --> 00:16:38.551
NEXT, MY LEVEL 3
FIRE ANT ASCATOR TUNES

00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:40.954
WITH MY LEVEL 5
ORACLE OF THE SUN

00:16:40.954 --> 00:16:43.857
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE ONE, THE ONLY...

00:16:43.857 --> 00:16:48.394
THE BEGINNING OF THE END
FOR YOU 3 PEONS...

00:16:48.394 --> 00:16:50.663
THE SUN DRAGON INTI!

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.401
Computer: SUN DRAGON INTI IS

00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.936
A LEVEL 8 LIGHT ATTRIBUTE

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.905
DRAGON TYPE MONSTER

00:16:58.905 --> 00:17:01.775
WITH 3,000 ATTACK POINTS
AND 2,800 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:17:01.775 --> 00:17:04.711
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT THING DOESN'T
LOOK SO TOUGH.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:06.579
DON'T YOU WORRY.
THERE'S MUCH MORE.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.517
NEXT, BY REMOVING
THE TUNER MONSTER FIRE
ANT ASCATOR FROM PLAY,

00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:12.786
I CAN SUMMON WEEPING IDOL.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.623
THEN BY LOWERING
MY LIFE POINTS BY 1,000,

00:17:16.623 --> 00:17:21.928
I CAN SUMMON
THE DARK TUNER DARK GODDESS
WITAKA FROM MY HAND!

00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:28.668
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
WITAKA'S ABILITY!

00:17:28.668 --> 00:17:30.069
WITH IT, I'M ALLOWED

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:32.672
TO MAKE HER LEVEL
EQUAL TO THE LEVEL OF
ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:17:32.672 --> 00:17:34.407
THAT'S OUT ON THE FIELD.

00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:37.443
SO SINCE SUN DRAGON
INTI'S LEVEL IS 8,

00:17:37.443 --> 00:17:41.047
WITAKA'S LEVEL NOW
BECOMES 8 AS WELL.

00:17:41.047 --> 00:17:42.649
AND NOW THAT SHE'S
PACKING MORE HEAT,

00:17:42.649 --> 00:17:47.887
I'LL HAVE HER DARK
TUNE WITH THE LEVEL 2
WEEPING IDOL.

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:57.030
SO YOU SEE, JUST
AS I HAVE BOTH THE POWER
OF LIGHT AND DARK,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.733
MY FIELD WILL HAVE
IT AS WELL.

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:01.768
FIRST THERE WAS
THE SUN DRAGON,

00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:06.306
AND NOW THERE IS
THE MOON DRAGON QUILLA!

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:09.876
BUT I'M AFRAID QUILLA
WON'T BE AROUND FOR LONG.

00:18:09.876 --> 00:18:12.645
YOU SEE, DUE TO
MY MOON DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:15.582
IT IS DESTROYED DURING
THE END PHASE OF MY TURN.

00:18:15.582 --> 00:18:17.283
Crow: SO THEN
WHY MAKE

00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:18.885
SUCH A PRODUCTION
OUT OF HIM
COMING OUT?

00:18:18.885 --> 00:18:21.321
YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A FEW SCREWS
LOOSE, DON'T YOU?

00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:23.656
OH, WELL. THIS'LL
BE OVER SOON ENOUGH!

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:24.824
'CAUSE THIS NEXT
ROUND, WE'RE PUTTIN'
THE HURT ON YOU

00:18:24.824 --> 00:18:26.559
BIG-TIME!

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:30.563
YES. THIS UPCOMING
ROUND SHOULD BE QUITE
INTERESTING INDEED.

00:18:30.563 --> 00:18:33.366
Crow, thinking:
I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:49.627
Crow, thinking:
ALL RIGHT, GOODWIN.
TIME TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:18:49.627 --> 00:18:51.996
Crow:
HERE GOES NOTHING!

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.798
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

00:18:53.798 --> 00:18:55.767
I PLAY THE SPEED
SPELL TUNE-UP 1-2-3.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.735
THANKS TO THIS,
I GET TO ROLL A DIE,

00:18:57.735 --> 00:18:58.736
AND THEN BLACKWING'S
LEVEL INCREASES

00:18:58.736 --> 00:19:01.706
DEPENDING ON
WHAT NUMBER I ROLL.

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:05.977
ALL RIGHT.

00:19:05.977 --> 00:19:08.746
BLACKWING'S LEVEL
INCREASES BY ONE.

00:19:08.746 --> 00:19:10.215
AND NOW I'LL
USE THIS BLACKWING

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:11.883
TO TUNE
MY OTHER ONE...

00:19:11.883 --> 00:19:15.453
BLACKWING...
BORA THE SPEAR!

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:17.589
AND I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.061
A SYNCHRO SUMMON!

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:27.098
THAT BRINGS OUT
BLACKWING ARMOR MASTER.

00:19:27.098 --> 00:19:28.533
AND DID I MENTION

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:30.168
WHEN A BLACKWING
IS FACE UP ON MY FIELD,

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:32.770
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
THE FOLLOWING MONSTER
WITHOUT ANY PENALTY.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.039
THAT'S RIGHT.
BLACKWING...
ELPHIN THE RAVEN,

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:38.109
YOU CAN COME ON OUT!

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:41.246
NOW, BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER,

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:44.048
ATTACK THAT
SUN DRAGON INTI!

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:45.950
SOARING SHADOW STRIKE.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.522
FOOL. YOUR BLACKWING DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.257
TO WIN THIS BATTLE.

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:55.160
Crow:
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.236
YOU SEE, BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER CAN'T
BE DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:20:05.236 --> 00:20:08.173
AND ANY BATTLE
DAMAGE THAT OCCURRED
BECOMES ZERO!

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:11.709
BUT WAIT. THERE'S MORE.
WHATEVER MONSTER
BLACKWING ATTACKED

00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:13.845
IS TAGGED WITH
A WEDGE COUNTER.

00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:14.913
AND ONCE IT WEDGES
ITS WAY INSIDE,

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:17.115
THAT MONSTER'S ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.950
BECOME ZERO
FOR THE TURN,

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.652
MEANING MY OTHER
BLACKWING...

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:22.954
ELPHIN THE RAVEN...
CAN'T MISS.

00:20:29.093 --> 00:20:31.696
[GOODWIN CHUCKLING SINISTERLY]

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:33.932
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, CROW.

00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:35.800
THERE'S NO SUCH
THING AS "CAN'T MISS,"

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.834
NOT FOR YOU

00:20:36.834 --> 00:20:38.436
AND NOT FOR THE SO-CALLED
LEGENDARY MAN

00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:40.138
YOU'VE MODELED
YOUR LIFE AFTER.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:42.540
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.909
Crow: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:46.911
Yusei: HOLD ON.
ARE YOU SAYING WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE SAYING?

00:20:46.911 --> 00:20:47.912
THAT YOU'RE...

00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:49.247
YOU'RE HIM?

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:51.082
THE ONE WHO BUILT
THE BRIDGE
FROM SATELLITE?

00:20:51.082 --> 00:20:53.651
Goodwin: BACK TO THE DUEL
AND TO YOUR ELPHIN THE RAVEN

00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:56.187
BECAUSE ANY MONSTER
THAT DESTROYS
SUN DRAGON INTI

00:20:56.187 --> 00:20:58.256
IS ALSO DESTROYED.

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.757
AND THEN YOU TAKE
DAMAGE EQUAL TO
ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:20:59.757 --> 00:21:03.228
AAH!

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.996
ADDITIONALLY,

00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:07.599
WHEN SUN DRAGON
INTI IS DESTROYED,

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.667
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
MOON DRAGON QUILLA
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:13.705
YOU SEE, CROW, EVEN
WHEN YOU CAN'T MISS,

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.907
YOU CAN STILL
BE DESTROYED.

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:18.576
THAT'S A LESSON
I LEARNED THE HARD WAY.

00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:21.446
YES, I AM THE ONE
WHO TRIED TO BUILD THAT
BRIDGE FROM SATELLITE.

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:22.914
I THOUGHT I, TOO,
COULDN'T MISS,

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.616
BUT I WAS WRONG.

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.684
AND NOW I KNOW THAT IF
YOU REALLY WANT SOMETHING,

00:21:26.684 --> 00:21:30.521
YOU MUST DO WHATEVER IS
NECESSARY TO GET IT!

00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:32.123
NOT IF IT
MEANS HURTING PEOPLE.

00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:35.860
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT
HERE AND RIGHT NOW.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.196
[GOODWIN CHUCKLING SINISTERLY]

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.465
OHH!

00:21:42.033 --> 00:21:43.067
Yusei: HEY, LOOK!

00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:45.270
NO WAY!
OUR MARKS!

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.738
Luna: THEY'RE GONE!

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:52.777
[GOODWIN CHUCKLING SINISTERLY]

00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:57.048
GOODWIN. SOMEHOW
HE'S TAKEN THEM
ALL FOR HIMSELF.

00:21:57.048 --> 00:21:59.217
[LAUGHTER CONTINUES]

00:22:02.153 --> 00:22:06.491
YOU SEE? I'LL STOP AT
NOTHING TO RULE ALL!
