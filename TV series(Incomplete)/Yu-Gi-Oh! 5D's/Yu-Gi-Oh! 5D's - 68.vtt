WEBVTT

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:07.774
Crow: WHAT HAPPENED

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:08.876
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS!

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:10.677
CLEANER STREETS,
NICE BUILDINGS...

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.012
Yusei: HA!

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.082
THE SATELLITE WE ALL
GREW UP IN IS GONE,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:17.351
WHAT DO YOU LADS SAY
TO A HIGH-SPEED RACE

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:19.019
THROUGH THE STREETS
FOR THE OLD TIME'S SAKE?

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.621
YOU'RE ON.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.499
Crow: WHAT'S UP,
LITTLE RUNTS?

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.101
Spike:
CROW! YUSEI!

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.435
LONG TIME NO SEE!

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.538
JACK, WILL YOU DUEL
ME LATER TODAY?!

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:40.574
WELL, LOOK WHO'S DECIDED
TO RETURN TO THEIR OLD
STOMPING GROUNDS.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.075
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.078
DID YOU SET UP SHOP FULL TIME
HERE, BLISTER?

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.713
YOU'VE TASTED
MARTHA'S COOKING.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.982
HOW COULD I WALK
AWAY FROM THAT?

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.184
HAVE YOU NERDS
BEEN BEHAVING?

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.053
BEEN PRACTICING
EVERY DAY.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.622
AND WE HELP MARTHA
TAKE CARE OF ALL
THE OLD PEOPLE.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.991
THEY CAUSIN' YOU
ANY TROUBLE, MARTHA?

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.528
NOTHIN' LIKE THE TROUBLE
YOU CAUSED ME WHEN YOU
WERE THEIR AGE.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.998
NOW GO LOOK AROUND
YOU THREE,

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.668
AND MEET US BACK
IN THE HOUSE.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.205
Martha:
SO WHAT DID HE SAY?

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.273
Schmidt: NOTHING.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.375
HE JUST LAUNCHED
A TRASH CAN LID AT ME.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.010
THAT SOUNDS PAINFUL.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.111
Martha:
OH, HEY, YOU THREE.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.280
MAYBE YOU CAN
HELP US OUT, CROW.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.348
WITH WHAT?

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:22.716
MISTER BASHFORD.

00:01:22.716 --> 00:01:24.418
AN ELDERLY FELLOW
WHO LIVES BY HIMSELF

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:25.919
OUT IN THE
GROGAN DISTRICT.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.487
WE'VE BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT HIM

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.089
AND WE WANTED
TO OFFER HIM
THE CHANCE TO RELOCATE

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.857
AND LIVE HERE
AT MARTHA'S PLACE.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.326
BUT HE'S A LITTLE HARD-HEADED

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:34.761
AND HE WON'T EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT
WE HAVE TO SAY.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.297
YOU SHOULD GO
AND CONVINCE HIM
TO MOVE HERE, CROW.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.865
WAIT, WHAT, WHY ME?

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.834
OLD PEOPLE MAKE ME
KINDA NERVOUS.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.337
HEAR THAT, YOU GUYS,
CROW'S NOT UP FOR
THE CHALLENGE.

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:44.371
SAY WHAT?

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.772
YEAH--HE CAN'T
PULL IT OFF.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.507
HE'S NOT CLEVER ENOUGH.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:48.742
OH, YES I AM!

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:50.344
YOU JUST SET

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.713
'CAUSE THIS OLD-FOSSIL'S

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.147
WAIT A MINUTE,
CROW.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.183
I'M ON THIS LIKE POP ON CORN.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:59.186
SO TALK TO ME, WHERE DO I FIND
THIS OLD CROCK POT?

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:02.556

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.935
NO, ADAM, I'M NOT...

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.104
NOT ANYMORE.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:29.276
HUH? TRESPASSERS.

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.516
SOMEBODY LIVES HERE?!

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.819
IT'S A MOUNTAIN OF JUNK.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.122
Yusei: IT'S MORE LIKE
A MOUNTAIN RANGE OF JUNK.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.524
ARE YOU CERTAIN
THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE?

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.625
THIS IS IT.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.127
ALRIGHT, GUYS,
I'M ON IT.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.830
Bashford:
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH, PUNK!

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.332
Blister:
AND THAT IS MISTER BASHFORD.

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:54.167
WHAT'S UP,

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.937
YA' WANNA DITCH THIS TRASH HEAP

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.772
Yusei: GOOD, CROW.
NICE AND DIRECT.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.274
Bashford:
THIS "TRASH HEAP" IS MY HOME!

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.442
BUT YOU'RE ALL ALONE.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.344
WHAT IF YOU FALL DOWN
AND CAN'T GET UP?

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:06.146
THE ONLY WAY I'M LEAVIN'S
IF YOU DRAG ME OUT.

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.714
WELL, YOU HEARD HIM.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.883
GUESS I GOTTA INFILTRATE
THE FORTRESS.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:11.618
HE'S GONNA
REGRET THAT.

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:13.954
AH!

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.470
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.772

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.273
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.142
BUT I CAN'T SAY
THE SAME FOR YOU!

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.944
AH!

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.180
AH!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.282

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.283
AH!

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.885

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.356
HA! HA HA!

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.292
WHOA! I'M FALLING!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.729
OKAY, NOW THIS IS MY IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME, BOYS.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.998
WE SHOULD DO STUFF LIKE THIS
MORE OFTEN.

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.268
CRAFTY USE OF THE DOUBLE TRAP,
GRAMPA...

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:04.604
THING IS...
I DO NOT GIVE UP EASILY.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.878
THANK YOU FOR FLYIN'
AIR BASHFORD!

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.081
WHOA!

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:18.718
I'D GIVE THAT DIVE

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:22.155
AH...HUH?

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.458

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.033
HUH?

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:35.635
THIS IS A DUEL ARENA.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.538
SO THAT WAS A HOLOGRAM JUST NOW.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.573
HEY, CROW!

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:40.607
THAT WAS A DOOZY.

00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:41.608
YOU ALRIGHT?

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.710
I'M GOOD.
BUT FORGET ME.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.779
LOOK AT THIS!
IT'S A DUEL ARENA!

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.414
LIKE A REAL ONE!

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.749
LOOK AT THOSE SUPPORTING RODS,
THEY'RE MADE OF TIRE RIMS.

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.750
YEAH...

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.086
I'M THINKING THIS
IS A HOMEMADE JOB.

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:54.120
Bashford:
HEY!

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.289
NO ONE'S ALLOWED UP THERE.
GET DOWN!

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.958
EASY THERE, GRANDPA...

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.793
I'M ONLY UP HERE BECAUSE

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:02.729
I DON'T CARE HOW
YOU GOT UP THERE.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:03.730
JUST GET DOWN.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.265
I GOT A BETTER IDEA--

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:08.101
WHY DON'T YOU GET ON UP HERE
AND DUEL ME, CENTURY MAN?

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.436
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:11.771
IF I LOSE,
I WILL QUIETLY LEAVE.

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:14.241
BUT IF I WIN, YOU HAVE
TO COME AND CHECK OUT

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.109
WHAT LIFE IS LIKE
AT MARTHA'S PLACE.

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:21.114

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.989

LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE
LOSING ON IT!

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:41.034
ARE THEY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS?

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:43.937
YOU AND I'VE DUELED
FOR SILLIER REASONS.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:53.613
LET'S DUEL!

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:55.115
SENIORITY FIRST!

00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:56.483

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:59.452
I SUMMON MATERNAL JUNK
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:03.323
ALRIGHT,

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:05.292

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.794
DON'T WORRY--
I'M PLANNING ON IT!

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.396
I'M NOT GOIN'
EASY ON YOU,

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:10.630
JUST 'CAUSE

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.732
I DRAW!

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:16.336
I SUMMON BLACKWING VAYU!

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.805
AND SINCE BIRDS OF A
FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER,

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.674
I CAN SUMMON ANOTHER
BLACKWING FROM MY HAND

00:07:20.674 --> 00:07:22.342
TO JOIN VAYU
ON THE FIELD.

00:07:22.342 --> 00:07:24.945
SAY HELLO TO
BORA THE SPEAR!

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.981
WHEN THIS BLACKWING
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.282
AND IT'S ROCKIN'
MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.917
THAN YOUR MONSTER
HAS DEFENSE POINTS...

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.053
IT SLAMS YOU
WITH THE DIFFERENCE!

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:35.288
DUCK AND COVER,
YA OLD FOGEY!

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:39.292

I ACTIVATE A TRAP--
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:46.933
NICE.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.602
LOOKS LIKE BASHFORD'S USING
A JUNK DECK LIKE MINE.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.073
AFTER SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW
SCRAPS YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK,

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:55.709
I CAN ONCE AGAIN PLACE IT
FACEDOWN ON MY FIELD!

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:58.278
SO--THERE!

00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:59.512
HEH.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.449
I'M THINKIN' I MIGHT'VE
UNDERESTIMATED
YOU, GRAMPS.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:07.620
AND BY UNDERESTIMATING ME,
YOU'VE WALKED HEADFIRST
INTO A CERTAIN DEFEAT.

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:26.239
IT'S MY TURN. I DRAW!

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:31.344

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.447

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.051
BUILT IT JUST FOR YOU.

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.253
LET'S BREAK IT IN WITH
A LITTLE FATHER-SON DUEL?

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:42.022
HA HA!

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.424
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW,
I GOTTA GO.

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:46.159
BUT...

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.997
HEY, GRANDPA--
SOMETHIN' WRONG?

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:53.333
IT'S NOTHIN', JUST...
JUST NEVER YOU MIND!

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:57.303
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!
SO MAKE A MOVE ALREADY.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.473
I SUMMON PATERNAL JUNK
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:05.178
AND WHEN MATERNAL JUNK
IS ON MY FIELD...

00:09:05.178 --> 00:09:09.582
PATERNAL JUNK GAINS AN
ADDITIONAL 500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:13.253
AND NOW FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE THE JUNK
FACTORY FIELD SPELL!

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.926
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.328
IT'S ABOUT WINNING,
SONNY BOY!

00:09:22.328 --> 00:09:24.264
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.334
SEE, HERE
IN THE JUNK FACTORY,

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:32.806
EVERY JUNK MONSTER ON THE FIELD
GAINS 500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:34.441
PRETTY GOOD, OLD DUDE!

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.142
YOU NEARLY DOUBLED
THAT MONSTER'S POWER

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.578
WITHOUT HAVING TO
SACRIFICE ANYTHING.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.780
BASHFORD'S
GOT A GOOD PAIR.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.782
AND IF HE SUMMONS WHAT
I THINK HE'LL SUMMON,

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.250
HE'LL HAVE A FULL HOUSE.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.019
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"HE'LL HAVE A FULL
HOUSE?"

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:48.054
YOU SAYING
CROW'S DONE FOR?

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.923
Yusei: NO WAY.
I'M PRETTY SURE CROW'S

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:51.991
GOT A FEW FEATHERS
UP HIS SLEEVE.

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:53.393
LET'S BATTLE!

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:55.628
GO, PATERNAL JUNK,

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:03.570
YOU JUST HELPED ME OUT,
YA' GOOFEY GEEZER.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.905
BECAUSE BLACKWING VAYU
THE EMBLEM OF HONOR

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.675
ONLY HAS THE POWER
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:10:08.675 --> 00:10:10.810
MY COMEBACK'LL BE
STARTING RIGHT NOW.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.246
IT'S HARD TO MAKE A COMEBACK
IN THE JUNK FACTORY, SONNY.

00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.547
WHADDYA MEAN?

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.882
IN THE JUNK FACTORY--

00:10:15.882 --> 00:10:18.685
WHEN ONE OF MY JUNK MONSTERS
DESTROYS ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS...

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:20.753
I CAN SNAG IT
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:22.555
AND SEND IT PACKIN'
BACK TO YOUR DECK.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.724
AAH!
AW, MAN!

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.595
NOT BAD.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.597
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YA',
YA OLD DOG.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:31.865
YOU STILL KNOW
A LOT OF TRICKS.

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.967
HA!...
WELL, FOR MY NEXT TRICK,

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.504
I PLACE THREE CARDS
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.139
WHY WON'T HE SUMMON IT?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.907
SUMMON WHAT?

00:10:43.343 --> 00:10:45.478
IT'S MY MOVE!...

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.180
HMPH!

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.916
I ACTIVATE

STRAFE SPELL CARD,

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:52.685
WHICH WIPES OUT ONE

IN DEFENSE MODE

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:55.788
BY SENDING A BLACKWING
FROM MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD!

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.057
LET'S SAY GOODBYE
TO MY SHURA THE
BLUE FLAME...

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.760
AND THEN SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR MATERNAL JUNK!

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:06.633
NOT SO FAST!
GO SCRAP-IRON BARRICADE!

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.269
DURING THIS TURN,
YOU CAN'T DESTROY THE MONSTER

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:12.739
PROTECTED BY THIS BARRICADE
WITH CARD EFFECTS!

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:14.040
GRR...

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.875
AND JUST LIKE

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:18.178
AFTER BEING ACTIVATED,

CAN RETURN TO ITS FACEDOWN
POSITION ON THE FIELD.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.115
GRR...

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:23.716
PRETTY GOOD, OLD TIMER!

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.687
BUT LET'S SEE HOW
YOU HANDLE BLACKWING
BLIZZARD THE FAR NORTH.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:32.025
WHEN BLIZZARD
THE FAR NORTH IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.193
I CAN THEN
SPECIAL SUMMON

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.595
ONE LEVEL 4-OR-BELOW

MY GRAVEYARD

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:37.063

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.865
SO I SPECIAL SUMMON--

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.502

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.040
THEN I'LL JUST ACTIVATE
ANOTHER TRAP!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.308
SCRAP-IRON PITFALL!

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:50.777
HUH? YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME!

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.278
AFRAID NOT, SPARKY!

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:53.880
WHEN YOU USE
A SPECIAL SUMMONING

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.381
TO BRING A MONSTER
TO THE FIELD,

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.117
IT FALLS RIGHT INTO
MY SCRAP-IRON PITFALL,

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.485
AND RETURNS TO YOUR HAND.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.321
AW, MAN!

00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.457

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.228
GRR...

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:10.563
THIS WHACKY OLD TIMER

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.198
LIKE HE SET UP
HIS HOUSE--

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.900
SURROUNDED
BY JUNK TRAPS.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.602
IF I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
A WAY THROUGH,

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:17.770
I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.274
THE OLD MAN'S
STARTING TO RATTLE OUR
EASILY RATTLED FRIEND.

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:25.178
CROW JUST NEEDS TO
FIND A WAY AROUND
ALL THOSE TRAPS.

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:28.681
FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE THE CARDS

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:38.491
SO BY SHIPPING OFF
MY SHURA THE BLUE FLAME,
I CAN DRAW!

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.228
WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER
BLACKWING ON MY FIELD,

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:43.863
I CAN SUMMON
GALE THE WHIRLWIND

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.332

ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS'
ATTACK AND DEFENSE
POINTS!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.609

YOU'RE NEVER GETTIN' TO ME,
SONNY BOY.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.730
HEH! NEVER SAY "NEVER,"

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:31.611
BEFORE ATTACKIN',
I ACTIVATE

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.674
AFTER I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD!

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.842
WHAT?

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.110
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE?

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.279
WITH THE TRAP JUNK SPIRIT
IN PLAY--

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:08.281
WHEN A JUNK MONSTER
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.882
AND SENT TO MY GRAVEYARD...

00:14:09.882 --> 00:14:11.317
I CAN RE-SUMMON
THAT MONSTER

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.819
DURING THE END PHASE!

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.854
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.489
NO WAY!!

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:19.492
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN!

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:21.794
AND NOW PATERNAL JUNK
RETURNS TO THE FIELD!

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.798
AND ONCE AGAIN, BECAUSE OF
MATERNAL JUNK AND PATERNAL
JUNK'S SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:29.202
PATERNAL JUNK GAINS
A THOUSAND ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.503
AW, GREAT...

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:31.838
SO WE'RE BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE.

00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:34.707
Yusei: OKAY,
NOW I'M CONFUSED--

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.542
WHAT'S THE OLD GUY WAITING FOR?

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:37.810
I KNOW.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.179
HE SEEMS INTO THAT
FAMILY STRUCTURE TACTIC,

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.514
SO WHY HASN'T
HE COMPLETED IT YET?

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:42.882
SO YOU'RE SAYING--

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.150
IF PATERNAL JUNK'S
THE FATHER

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.318
AND MATERNAL JUNK'S
THE MOTHER,

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:46.352
THEN THAT MEANS...

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.954
THAT MEANS
THERE'S A THIRD CARD

00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:50.423
MISSING FROM
THAT FAMILY.

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:51.858
Yusei: YUP--KID JUNK.

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:53.926
IF HE'D SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD,

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:56.496
PATERNAL JUNK'D GAIN ANOTHER
THOUSAND ATTACK POINTS

00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:59.232
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE KID
FROM ANY HARM.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:00.366
Blister: GOTCHA.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.667
AND IF
THAT HAPPENED--

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.170
THE OLD MAN WOULD
HAVE THIS IN THE
BAG, IS THAT IT?

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.906
WELL, IF THAT WAS PART
OF HIS PLAN, HE'D HAVE
DONE IT ALREADY.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.575
WITH PATERNAL JUNK
AND MATERNAL JUNK
BOTH ON THE FIELD,

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:13.579
GRAMPS COULD'VE USED THEIR
ABILITIES TO SUMMON KID JUNK
STRAIGHT FROM HIS HAND.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:17.583
SO WHY WOULDN'T
THAT BE PART OF
THE OLD MAN'S PLAN?

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.985
WHO KNOWS.

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:23.222
WHAT'S GOIN' ON, YUSEI?
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:25.224
GOIN' TO POKE AROUND
IN THE OLD MAN'S HOUSE.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.559
I'VE GOT A HUNCH
ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.827
WHAT KINDA HUNCH?

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:30.263
LET'S JUST SAY THAT IF
IT TURNS OUT I'M RIGHT,

00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:33.232
THEN CROW HAS NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:36.302
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT IS HIS HUNCH?

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.037
Bashford:
MY TURN, SONNY.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.339
I DRAW! HUH.

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.609
I ACTIVATE
THE JUNK BARRAGE SPELL CARD.

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:47.146
Duel Runner Computer:
WHEN THE MONSTER EQUIPPED
WITH THE SPELL CARD

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:49.348
JUNK BARRAGE DESTROYS A MONSTER,

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:53.119
YOU DEAL DAMAGE EQUAL TO HALF
THE DESTROYED MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.354
Bashford: AND I EQUIP IT
ON TO PATERNAL JUNK!

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.156
AND WITH THAT BOOST...

00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:00.526
NOW, PATERNAL JUNK,
ATTACK BLACKWING GALE
THE WHIRLWIND!

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.403
LOOKS LIKE THAT BIRDBRAIN
OF A MONSTER YOU HAVE

00:16:10.403 --> 00:16:11.637
IS ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:14.440
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS ARE
ABOUT TO FLY THE COOP, CROW.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.741
IT'S OVER!

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:16.843
AAH!

GET READY FOR A THRASHIN',
SCOOTER!

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:36.028
ARGH...

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:39.198
THIS FUNNY OLD GUY'S
NOT SO FUNNY ANYMORE.

00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:43.169
WHOA, WHAT IS THAT?

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.770
FEELS LIKE THE COMMOTION

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.240

WHAT'S A MATTER,

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:56.249
YOU'RE NOT SCARED OF
LOSIN' TO ME, ARE YA?

00:16:56.249 --> 00:16:58.317
ALRIGHT, IF THAT'S
HOW IT'S GONNA BE--

00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:01.020
I'M ACTIVATING
THE BLACK THUNDER
TRAP CARD!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.190
WHEN A BLACKWING
ON MY FIELD IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE--

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.660
BLACK THUNDER CRASHES
DOWN ON YOU FOR 400
POINTS OF DAMAGE--

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.329
FOR EVERY CARD
ON YOUR FIELD!

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.131
AND SINCE YOU'VE
GOT SEVEN

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:14.066
CARDS ON YOUR
FIELD, WELL...

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:17.103
HEH! LET'S JUST SAY THIS
MIGHT STING A LITTLE.

00:17:17.103 --> 00:17:20.172
AAH!

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.010
BASHFORD!

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:26.178
CROW!

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:27.613
HEY LOOK OUT!

00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:41.360
CROW! BASHFORD!

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.729
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?!

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.766
AH!

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.000
WERE YOU LOOKI''
FOR US?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.336
OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE SAFE.

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.773
NO...

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:56.976
ADAM'S DUEL ARENA,
THIS CAN'T BE. AH!

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:58.844
AH! STAY BACK.

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:00.313
LET GO OF ME, SQUIRT.

00:18:00.313 --> 00:18:02.048
I HAVE TO GET
INTO MY HOUSE.

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:04.383
Yusei: I'M AFRAID
THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT OF IT.

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:07.219
YUSEI! WHAT
WERE YOU DOING?

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.487
I'M SORRY.

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.723
YOUR HOUSE WAS BURIED
IN THE RUBBLE,

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:12.592
BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET
OUT IN TIME WITH THIS.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.827
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT IT.

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:18.297
AAW, LOOK AT THAT!
A NICE FAMILY MOMENT.

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:19.465
FAMILY?

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.033
WE FIGURED YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A FAMILY.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.504
I DON'T, I...
WELL, I...

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:26.606
I DID.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.374
YOU DIDN'T SUMMON
KID JUNK.

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.977
I'M GUESSING THAT'S
BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART
OF YOUR DECK, RIGHT?

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:32.445
HUH?

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:37.049
THAT'S RIGHT.
I USED TO HAVE IT, BUT...

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.618
I GAVE IT TO MY SON...

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:42.288
I WAS A SCULPTURE ARTIST.

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.458
AND I WAS SO FOCUSED
ON MY WORK

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:49.161
THAT I NEGLECTED WHAT WAS REALLY
MOST IMPORTANT TO ME...

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.097
WHEN I REALIZED
HOW I'D BEEN ACTING,

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.733
I BUILT THIS DUEL ARENA
TO TRY TO MAKE AMENDS,

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:56.936
BUT...IT WAS TOO LATE.

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:59.639
I HAVE WOKEN UP
EVERY DAY SINCE

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:03.309
THINKING "MAYBE THIS'LL
BE THE DAY MY SON COMES
BACK HOME FOR A DUEL."

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:08.247
SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO LEAVE THIS PLACE,
YOU'RE WAITING.

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:10.983
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:16.422
YES. I'VE--I'VE SPENT
AN ENTIRE LIFETIME WAITING.

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:19.258
[CRYING]

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.128
YA' KNOW WHAT?...

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:24.096
YOU GOT YOURSELF A NEW SON
RIGHT HERE!

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:25.264
HUH?

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:28.267
IN FACT, YOU'VE GOT FOUR,
FOUR GIANT LITTLE BOYS!

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:29.402
HE'S RIGHT.

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:30.569
I WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.571
AND LEARN A THING OR TWO
FROM YOU ABOUT JUNK DECKS.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:33.773
YES.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.275
I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO COME
AROUND AND DUEL WITH YOU.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.277
AND IF YOU LIVE
AT MARTHA'S,

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:39.412
YOU'LL BE SURROUNDED
BY MORE GRANDKIDS

00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:41.047
THAN YOU CAN SHAKE A CANE AT.

00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:43.482
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.685
Crow: WELL, THEN,
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:51.390
Child: OH! SO COOL!

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.393
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

00:19:54.393 --> 00:19:56.595
IT'S LIKE THE REAL
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:58.164
NO, IT'S EVEN BETTER!

00:19:58.164 --> 00:19:59.398
HA HA!

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.134
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D GO THAT FAR.

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:04.103
IT SEEMS LIKE
HE'LL BE HAPPY HERE.

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:06.205
YOU'VE DONE YOUR GOOD DEED
FOR THE DAY, CROW.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.306
YA' THINK SO?

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.241
HEY, CROW, GET OVER HERE.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:11.343
MY SHOULDERS ARE KILLIN' ME.

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.978
COME HERE AND RUB 'EM
FOR ME, WOULD YA?

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:15.347
HUH?
WHY DO I HAVE TO?

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:18.384
QUIT WHININ' AND HELP
A TIRED OLD MAN OUT, CROW.

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:19.952
DON'T YOU WANNA GET IN
YOUR GOOD DEED FOR THE DAY?

00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:21.020
I DID THAT!

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.354
GO ON, CROW!

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.790
YOU'RE HIS NEW SON,
REMEMBER?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.959
OH, YEAH.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.327
THAT'S THE STUFF
RIGHT THERE.

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.796
DON'T BE WEAK,
PUT SOME STRENGTH
INTO IT.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.164
OH, LIKE THIS?

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:33.566
OW, OW, OW, OW!

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:34.900
YOU SAID TO PUT
SOME STRENGTH INTO IT!

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.302
I DID NOT!

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:39.371
DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE GENTLE
WITH YOUR ELDERS?

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.973
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:42.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.848
Blister: GUYS, NOW THAT THE OLD
MAN'S HAPPY, WE NEED TO TALK.

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:50.716
Yusei: TALK ABOUT WHAT?

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:54.420
DID YOU GUYS SEE THE REPORT
ABOUT THAT METEOR THAT HIT
OUTSIDE THE CITY?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.654
YEAH.

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:57.757
WE DIDN'T NEED
A NEWS REPORT,
WE HEARD THE IMPACT.

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.292
I'VE BEEN PICKING UP
SOME WEIRD CHATTER
ABOUT IT

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:01.927
ON THE PSB CHANNELS.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:03.129
WHAT SORT OF CHATTER?

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:04.730
CRYPTIC STUFF...

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.600
FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER,
IT SEEMS LIKE IT WASN'T
A ROCK THAT FELL...

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.603
I'VE HEARD A FEW REFERENCES
TO "THE STONE TABLET."

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.104
THIS WAS TWO WEEKS AGO,
RIGHT?

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:15.040
THAT WAS THE SAME TIME
THAT DUEL BOT GHOST
STARTED SHOWING UP.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.776
THINK THERE MIGHT BE
A CONNECTION THERE?

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.011
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHATEVER
IT IS THAT FELL,

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.947
IT SEEMS THE PUBLIC SECURITY
BUREAU GOT HOLD OF IT

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.716
AND IS KEEPING IT
VERY HUSH-HUSH.

00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:26.619
A STONE TABLET.
A DUEL BOT.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.421
WHAT EXACTLY IS
GOING ON AROUND
HERE?

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.891
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
ONE THING IS CLEAR--

00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:34.894
SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW.
