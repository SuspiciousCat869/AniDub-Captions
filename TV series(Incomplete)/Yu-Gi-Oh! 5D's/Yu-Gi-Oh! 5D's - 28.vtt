00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:03.247
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's"...

00:00:03.247 --> 00:00:04.615
MC: AND IT'S OFFICIAL!

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:06.850
WE HAVE A NEW CHAMPION!

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.121
THE CROWN HAS BEEN PASSED
ON TO YUSEI FUDO!

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.490
[THINKING]
I MAY HAVE BEATEN JACK,
BUT I'VE GOT A FEELING

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.327
THAT A NEW BATTLE
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:00:16.327 --> 00:00:18.896
DON'T WORRY.
MISTER ATLAS IS
GONNA BE FINE.

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:21.732
WE JUST NEED TO GET HIM
TO THE CLINIC FOR SOME
ROUTINE TESTS.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:25.669
JACK, WHAT DID WE SEE
IN THAT LIGHT?

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.405
ACCORDING TO LEGEND,
THE CRIMSON DRAGON'S

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:32.109
HEAD, WINGS, HANDS,
LEGS, AND TAIL,

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.211
WERE SPLIT
INTO FIVE PARTS

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:35.980
AND THEN SEALED AWAY
AS MARKS

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.781
ON THE ORIGINAL SIGNERS.

00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:39.516
THE MARKS WERE
THEN PASSED DOWN

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.719
THROUGH THE GENERATIONS.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.220
Leo: SO LUNA'S
A SIGNER,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.722
JACK'S A SIGNER,

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:46.523
AKIZA'S A SIGNER,

00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:48.325
AND YUSEI'S A SIGNER.

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:50.060
SO WHO'S
THE OTHER ONE?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.428
[BEEPING]

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:53.163
CARLY, WHERE ARE YA!?

00:00:53.163 --> 00:00:55.366
WELL, SIR, I FOUND
A BIG SCOOP.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.501
A CONSPIRACY
AT THE FORTUNE CUP!

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.471
THIS ONE MIGHT LEAD
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:03.774
SO GOODWIN HAS ASSEMBLED
HIS PRECIOUS SIGNERS

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:06.210
AND SUMMONED
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.680
I THINK IT'S TIME WE
MAKE OUR PRESENCE KNOWN.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.682
WE MUST LOWER
THE CURTAIN OF SHADOWS

00:01:11.682 --> 00:01:13.517
ON DOMINO CITY.

00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:15.953
THE DAWN OF THE SPIDER
HAS COME.

00:01:15.953 --> 00:01:20.424
AND SOON IT SHALL CLOAK
THIS WORLD IN DARKNESS.

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:23.027
HA HA HA!

00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:24.428
WHO ARE YOU?

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:27.031
I AM A SHADOW DRONE
AND IF YOU SEEK THE TRUTH,

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:30.100
THEN MY MASTER SAYS YOU
MUST DUEL ME FOR IT.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.669
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DUEL.

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:35.873
GO, SCRAP FIST!

00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:37.808
Computer:
DUEL DISK SIGNALS DETECTED.

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:39.343
THOSE NUMBERS
CAN'T BE RIGHT.

00:01:39.343 --> 00:01:42.179
READINGS DON'T
GET THAT STRONG.

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.814
WHAT WAS THAT
LIGHT DOWN THERE?

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:47.251
COME FORTH,
FROZEN FITZGERALD!

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:48.986
A DARK
SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:50.721
HOW DO I
BATTLE THAT?

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:52.156
[THINKING]
SOON, THE WHOLE WORLD

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:54.658
WILL KNOW WHAT GOODWIN'S
TRYING TO HIDE.

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:55.726
Yusei, thinking:
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:56.960
HOW TO BEAT
THIS SHADOW DRONE

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.229

AND WHICH OF
THE SIGNERS DID HE FIND?

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:19.443
YUSEI FUDO,

00:03:19.443 --> 00:03:21.979
THE NEW CHAMPION
FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.413
HE DUELED
WITH GREAT STRENGTH

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:25.749
IN THE FORTUNE CUP,
BUT LET'S SEE IF

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:31.455
HIS POWER IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO ESCAPE OUR TRAP!

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:33.290

MR. MYSTERY MAN.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.792
WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO
TO THE SATELLITE?

00:03:35.826 --> 00:03:37.094
CONTINUE THE DUEL,

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:38.795

HUH?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:03:46.503 --> 00:03:48.872
IT'S SOME SORTA...
UNDERGROUND DUEL.

00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:50.941

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:52.109
YUSEI?!

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.577
WHAT IS HE
DOING HERE?!

00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:56.413
STAY COOL, CARLY,
AND JUST START
RECORDING.

00:03:56.413 --> 00:03:58.382

00:03:58.382 --> 00:04:00.284
THIS IS FIELD REPORTER

SOME KIND OF PARKING
GARAGE THING I GUESS.

00:04:03.587 --> 00:04:06.123
BUT! THE BIG STORY
HERE IS,

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:07.958
NEW DOMINO CITY'S
NEWEST CHAMP

00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.127
IN AN UNDERGROUND
DUEL WITH...

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.696
UM... SOME GUY IN
A, IN A BATH ROBE,

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:14.464
WITH A GLOWING ARM
LIKE YUSEI'S.

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:17.501
HA! YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE DARKNESS, YUSEI!

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.870
AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU
BY PLAYING THE DARK TUNER

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.638
CATASTROGUE WHICH
WILL SEND YOUR MONSTER

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:23.807
TO THE SHADOWS!
HA HA HA!

00:04:23.807 --> 00:04:25.909
Computer: WHEN DARK TUNER
CATASTROGUE IS USED

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.879
TO SUMMON A SYNCHRO MONSTER
YOU CAN DESTROY ONE CARD

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.814
ON YOUR OPPONENTS
SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.319
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.121
[GROWLS]

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.157
JUNK WARRIOR! NO!

00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:42.593
Carly: "DARK TUNER"?
THAT'S A NEW ONE!

00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:44.494
I WONDER WHAT ELSE
THIS GUY HAS?!

00:04:44.494 --> 00:04:46.230
LIKE THE FLY CAUGHT
IN THE WEB,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.564
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:49.666
FROZEN FITZGERALD,
ATTACK!!!

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:53.103
NOT SO FAST!
WHAT?

00:04:53.103 --> 00:04:54.771
MY MONSTER PREVENTS
YOU FROM USING

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:56.607
ANY TRAP OR SPELL CARDS.

00:04:56.607 --> 00:04:58.742
YOU'RE TRAPPED
IN THE THREADS OF DARKNESS

00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:00.344
AND AS LONG AS YOU
BELIEVE IN THE POWER

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:02.846
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON
THERE IS NO HOPE!

00:05:04.948 --> 00:05:08.485
UNH! AAH! UNH!

00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:10.254
[THINKING]
IF I WANT TO SAVE
THE SATELLITE,

00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:13.156
I BETTER FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO BEAT
THIS GUY AND FAST!

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.462
Carly: I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WE'RE SEEING,

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.963
BUT YUSEI SEEMS
REALLY HURT!

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.532
COULD IT BE THAT
THESE DARK MONSTERS'

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:33.966
ATTACKS ARE REAL?!

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.068
YOU'RE NO MATCH
FOR THE FORCES I REPRESENT!

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:37.904
SOON, LIKE ALL LIGHT
IN THE UNIVERSE YOU

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:39.238
TOO SHALL FADE.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.541
WHO ARE YOU?!

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.643
ARE YOU WORKING
FOR GOODWIN?

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.012
HIM? NOT QUITE.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:48.381
I DRAW...

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.082
AND NO MATTER
WHO SENT YOU HERE,

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:53.019
I'M GONNA BEAT YOU
AND GET THE ANSWERS
I WANT!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.122
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
DESCENDING LOST STAR.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.857
SO NOW I CAN
RE-SUMMON A MONSTER

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.225
FROM MY GRAVEYARD...

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:04.030
AND I'M BRINGING BACK
MY JUNK WARRIOR!

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.165
BUT I THINK I'LL
BE TRADING HIM IN
TO UPGRADE

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:08.801
FOR SOMETHING THAT
HAS JUST A LITTLE
MORE HORSEPOWER:

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.836
LIKE MY TURRET WARRIOR!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.810
NOW JUNK WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS GET
ADDED TO HIS!

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.412
LET'S SEE YOUR
"DARKNESS" STAND UP

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:22.548

YOUR PATHETIC ATTEMPT
TO DESTROY THE DARKNESS
HAS FAILED.

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.851
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
HERE BUT DELAY YOUR FATE,
MY POOR YUSEI.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:03.022
FROZEN FITZGERALD RETURNS
TO MY FIELD IF HE'S EVER
DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.492
WHAT?!

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.660
AND THERE'S MORE.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.695
IF ANY OF YOUR MONSTERS
ATTACKED MINE,

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.864
THEN THEY'RE
AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYED!

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:13.599
AFTER ALL, REVENGE

[THINKING]
OH, MAN, I GOTTA
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.013
AROUND THAT
MONSTER OF HIS
BECAUSE IF I LOSE,

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.948
THAT VISION
OF THE SATELLITE
BEING DESTROYED

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.050
MIGHT COME TRUE.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.485
WE SENSE YOUR FEAR.

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:34.654
IT GROWS LIKE
WAXING NIGHT.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.589
LIKE MY MONSTERS,
THE DARK SIGNERS

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.157
WILL ALWAYS WIN.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.426
WHAT?! IS THAT
WHO YOU ARE?!

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.028
DON'T BE SO SURPRISED.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.664
LIGHT AND DARK ARE
TWO SIDES OF ONE COIN,

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.032
WE ARE THE SAME.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:48.000
SORRY, NEVER GOT
THE MEMBERSHIP KIT.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.303

FIND IT AS FUNNY

WHEN YOUR WORLD
IS DESTROYED?

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.773
SO THE VISION
WAS TRUE?!

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:55.608
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE DARK SIGNERS POSSESS

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.543
A POWER THAT WILL ERASE
THE LIGHT OF YOUR MARK

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.578

TO SAVE WITH IT.

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:01.147
NOT ON MY WATCH.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.883
TO PROVE IT I PLAY
THE SPELL ONE FOR ONE!

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:06.519
SO BY SENDING
ONE MONSTER
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.954
I CAN THEN SUMMON
ANOTHER MONSTER
FROM MY HAND,

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.457
NOW, ONCE I ATTACK
YOUR SONIC CHICK,

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:47.660
ALL THOSE EXTRA ATTACK POINTS
ARE JUST THROWN AWAY.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.829
IN FACT, HALF
OF THEM REPLENISH

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:51.297
MY BOUNTIFUL LIFE POINTS,

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.631
WHILE YOU GET
THE OTHER HALF...

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:54.834
AS DAMAGE!

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:55.968
ATTACK!

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.269
WIPE HIS MARK CLEAN!

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:10.850
HA HA HA!

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.351
SOON YOU
WILL BE FINISHED

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.453
AS WILL YOUR
PRECIOUS SATELLITE!

00:09:32.034 --> 00:09:34.403
SOON, THE POWER
OF THE SPIDER'S THREAD

00:09:34.403 --> 00:09:37.006
WILL SQUEEZE THE LAST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS TO ZERO

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:39.208
AND ABSORB YOU
INTO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.110
I'LL NEVER
LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.879
TRY ALL YOU WANT,
BUT IN THE END,

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:45.781
THE DARKNESS WILL CONSUME
YOU AND YOUR PRECIOUS HOME!

00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:47.316
I WONT' LET IT!

00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:49.585
THIS WEB IS
ALREADY WOVEN.

00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:51.754
IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE FUTURE,

00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:53.055
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I'M GOING TO

00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:54.690
STOP YOU RIGHT NOW!

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.126
HA! BUT HOW CAN YOU STOP ME
WHEN YOU WON'T EVEN BE

00:09:57.126 --> 00:10:00.296
HERE FOR ONE MORE ROUND?

00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:01.631
WELL THEN LET'S
FINISH THIS

00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:03.366
AND SEE WHO'S RIGHT.

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:06.302
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:08.905
I SUMMON
NITRO SYNCHRON!

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.643
AND WITH HIM ON MY FIELD
I CAN RE-SUMMON

00:10:13.643 --> 00:10:15.678
ONE MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:10:15.678 --> 00:10:18.981
SO I'M BRINGING BACK
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:24.520
NEXT I ACTIVATE
GRACEFUL REVIVAL.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.222
WHICH LETS ME BRING
ANOTHER MONSTER BACK

00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:28.758
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
TO THE FIELD:

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.293
WELCOME BACK,
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:10:33.362 --> 00:10:35.765
AND NOW I TUNE
SONIC CHICK,
SPEED WARRIOR,

00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:38.534
AND QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
WITH MY NITRO SYNCHRON

00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:40.069
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:41.704
NITRO WARRIOR!

00:10:47.043 --> 00:10:48.978
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:10:48.978 --> 00:10:53.749
[ROARS]

00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:55.484
AND THANKS TO
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:55.484 --> 00:10:58.454
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD!

00:10:58.454 --> 00:11:01.457
AND NOW I'M GIVING MY
WARRIOR A POWER BOOST!

00:11:08.164 --> 00:11:11.300
NEXT I ACTIVATE
NITRO WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.603
WHICH GIVES HIM
AN EXTRA ONE THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS

00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:17.006
BECAUSE I
PLAYED THE SPELL CARD
JUNK BARRAGE.

00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:20.476
AND NOW... ATTACK
FROZEN FITZGERALD!

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:30.653
AND BECAUSE I
USED THE POWER
OF MY JUNK BARRAGE,

00:11:30.653 --> 00:11:33.189
YOUR LIFE POINTS NOW
TAKE AN ADDITIONAL HIT!

00:11:40.062 --> 00:11:41.731
THAT DOESN'T FAZE ME!

00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:43.966
CAUSE MY FROZEN
FIEND WILL COME BACK

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:46.502
AND DESTROY YOU
ON MY NEXT TURN!

00:11:46.502 --> 00:11:49.338
[GROWLS]

00:11:49.338 --> 00:11:51.974
DON'T COUNT ON IT!
HUH?

00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:55.111
SEE MY NITRO WARRIOR'S
GOT ANOTHER
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:55.111 --> 00:11:57.046
WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO
SWITCH YOUR MONSTER

00:11:57.046 --> 00:11:59.682
INTO ATTACK MODE
AND THEN ATTACK
YOU AGAIN!

00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:03.886
SO PREPARE TO FEEL
THE FURY

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:06.422
OF MY NITRO WARRIOR'S
DYNAMITE CRUNCH!

00:12:06.422 --> 00:12:07.723
ATTACK!

00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:10.926
HUH?

00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:20.302
[GROANING]

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:22.238
AND WITH YOUR
MONSTER DESTROYED,

00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:23.806
I CAN
FINISH YOU OFF!

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.641
[GROANING]

00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:37.620
WHOA. IT LOOKS LIKE...

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.789
YUSEI JUST WON THE MATCH!

00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:41.624
AND IT'S ON TAPE!

00:12:41.624 --> 00:12:45.161
I JUST GOT THE SCOOP
OF THE CENTURY!

00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:46.896
UNH! UGH!

00:12:46.896 --> 00:12:47.963
AHH!

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:57.573
WAKE UP!

00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:00.309
HEY, YOU OWE ME SOME
ANSWERS, GOT THAT?

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.178
START TALKIN'!

00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:05.614
START TALKIN'
ABOUT WHAT?

00:13:05.614 --> 00:13:07.183
OHH. WHO ARE YOU?

00:13:07.183 --> 00:13:09.618
WHAT AM'I DOIN' HERE?!

00:13:09.618 --> 00:13:11.620
STOP FOOLING AROUND
AND TELL ME WHAT

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.823
YOUR SPIDER MARK
HAS TO DO
WITH THE SATELLITE!

00:13:13.823 --> 00:13:16.592
HUH?

00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:19.261
[THINKING]
HIS MARK! IT'S GONE!

00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:21.797
HI I'M CARLY CARMINE,
AND I WAS HOPING YOU'D TELL

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:24.266
ME WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
THE FIRST AMATEUR TO

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:25.801
TAKE ON DOMINO CITY'S
NEW CHAMP?

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.236
AND WHY ARE
YOU ASKING?!

00:13:27.236 --> 00:13:29.705
BECAUSE I'M
A WORLD RENOWNED REPORTER,

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:32.308
AND THIS IS GONNA BE
MY BIGGEST STORY EVER.

00:13:32.308 --> 00:13:33.676
NOW, PERHAPS YOU
WOULDN'T MIND ANSWERING

00:13:33.676 --> 00:13:34.977
A FEW THINGS.

00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:36.645
FIRST, WERE YOU
ALWAYS PLANNING TO USE

00:13:36.645 --> 00:13:38.948
NITRO WARRIOR
TRIPLE-SYNCHRO SUMMON?

00:13:38.948 --> 00:13:41.784
TWO, DID YOU HAVE
A COUNTER FOR FROZEN
FITZY'S RE-SUMMONING?

00:13:41.784 --> 00:13:44.120
THREE. IS THIS SOME
PUBLICITY STUNT?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.789
WHY WOULD I BE A PART
OF SOME PUBLICITY STUNT?

00:13:46.789 --> 00:13:48.758
BECAUSE HE BEAT
JACK ATLAS

00:13:48.758 --> 00:13:51.293
AND MAYBE HE'S TRYING
TO SHOWCASE HIS
STREET TECHNIQUES!

00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:52.995
[THINKING]
THERE ARE CARDS
MISSING.

00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:56.999
HIS DARK TUNER AND
DARK SYNCHRO MONSTER
HAVE VANISHED.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.534
THIS GUY'S
THE NEW CHAMPION?

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:00.069
AND I TRIED TO
DUEL HIM?

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:01.604
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU DON'T KNOW

00:14:01.604 --> 00:14:03.172
WHY YOU'RE HERE,
WHY YOU'RE DUELING,

00:14:03.172 --> 00:14:05.374
AND WHY YOUR ARM HAD
A SPIDER ON IT.

00:14:05.374 --> 00:14:07.143
SPIDER.

00:14:07.143 --> 00:14:09.011
WAIT, THAT REMINDS
ME OF SOMETHING...

00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:10.513
I WAS DOWN IN THE NARROWS
WAITING FOR A COUPLE

00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:13.682
OF DUEL BUDDIES
WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE...

00:14:13.682 --> 00:14:15.651
IT FELT LIKE SOME
KINDA SPIDER STUNG ME

00:14:15.651 --> 00:14:17.553
OR SOMETHING.

00:14:17.553 --> 00:14:18.554
A SPIDER?!

00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:20.189
[ALARM BLARES]

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:21.457
WHO CALLED SECURITY?!

00:14:21.457 --> 00:14:22.625
WE BETTER GET OUTTA
HERE BEFORE THEY

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:24.059
START ASKING
QUESTIONS.

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:26.262
B-BUT MY INTERVIEW!

00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:28.798
WE'LL FINISH
IT LATER!

00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:31.500
WAIT! JUST ONE
MORE QUESTION!

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.802
COME ON!
WAIT!

00:14:32.835 --> 00:14:34.537
AAH!

00:14:38.874 --> 00:14:40.943
PLEASE! DON'T LEAVE
ME BEHIND!

00:14:40.943 --> 00:14:42.478
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
HUH?!

00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:45.848
I LOST THE BEST
SCOOP EVER!

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:55.024
SO, ARE YOU TWO
RESPONSIBLE

00:14:55.024 --> 00:14:56.492
FOR ALL THIS
PROPERTY DAMAGE?

00:14:56.492 --> 00:14:57.793
WHAT?

00:14:57.827 --> 00:14:59.662
OH... THAT.

00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:01.463
HANDS UP!

00:15:01.463 --> 00:15:03.332
AAH!
AAH!

00:15:10.973 --> 00:15:11.974
ERR.

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:16.979
IT SEEMS THE FLY
HAS ESCAPED
THE SPIDER'S WEB.

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:19.348
FOR THE MOMENT,
KALIN, YES.

00:15:19.348 --> 00:15:21.650
BUT THIS WAS JUST A TEST
TO SEE IF THIS SATELLITE

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.719
WAS TRULY WORTHY
OF OUR EFFORTS.

00:15:23.719 --> 00:15:26.755
REMEMBER THAT OUR WEB
IS WIDE AND STRONG.

00:15:26.755 --> 00:15:29.491
THE SPIDER'S BITE
SWIFT AND MERCILESS.

00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:31.627
IT'S NOT THE VENOM
WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:15:31.627 --> 00:15:33.529
BUT THE PREY.

00:15:33.529 --> 00:15:35.197
HA HA HA!

00:15:41.604 --> 00:15:43.906
HEY! WHERE'D YOU RUN OFF
TO LAST NIGHT?

00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:46.041
I WAS GETTIN' WORRIED.

00:15:46.041 --> 00:15:47.810
THERE WAS REALLY
STRANGE GUY OUTSIDE,

00:15:47.843 --> 00:15:48.844
AND I FOLLOWED HIM.

00:15:48.844 --> 00:15:49.912
WHAT HAPPENED?!

00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:51.080
DID HE CHALLENGE
YOU TO A DUEL?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.882
YEAH. AND HE WAS
BEING CONTROLLED

00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:54.516
BY A GROUP CALLED
THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:55.951
DID YOU SAY
SIGNERS?!

00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:57.319
HE HAD A MARK.

00:15:57.319 --> 00:15:59.521
AND IT GLOWED LIKE MINE,
BUT IT WAS IN THE SHAPE

00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:00.789
OF A SPIDER...

00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:10.712
ATTACK!

00:16:10.712 --> 00:16:12.781
WIPE HIS MARK CLEAN.

00:16:12.781 --> 00:16:15.450
SO, THEY'VE FINALLY
MADE THEIR MOVE.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.986
THE DARK SIGNERS MAY
PRESENT A PROBLEM.

00:16:17.986 --> 00:16:19.654
YES, BUT THEY'RE
NOTHING WE CAN'T
HANDLE,

00:16:19.654 --> 00:16:21.056
MY OLD FRIEND.

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:23.325
IF THEY WANT TO
FIGHT ME, WELL...

00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:25.193
THEY'LL GET MORE
THAN A BATTLE,

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:26.495
THEY'LL GET A WAR.

00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:44.758
PEOPLE OF THE SATELLITE,

00:16:44.758 --> 00:16:47.494
THE HAND YOU HAVE BEEN DEALT
IN LIFE IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:50.564
LAY BLAME ON NEW DOMINO CITY
AND ITS CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:16:50.564 --> 00:16:53.066
FOR THE CRIMSON DRAGON
WILL ONLY PUSH THE PEOPLE

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:54.868
OF THE SATELLITE
DOWN FURTHER!

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:57.137
LISTEN TO THE WORDS
WE SPEAK TODAY

00:16:57.137 --> 00:16:58.338
IF YOU WANT A BETTER LIFE!

00:16:58.338 --> 00:16:59.973
THE STRENGTH
OF THE DARK SHADOWS

00:16:59.973 --> 00:17:01.208
WILL RESCUE YOU ALL!

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.676
IT WILL RELEASE YOU
FROM THIS DESPAIR

00:17:02.676 --> 00:17:04.177
YOU CALL LIFE!

00:17:04.177 --> 00:17:06.513
BELIEVE MY WORDS
AND FOLLOW US!

00:17:06.513 --> 00:17:08.482

00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:11.118
WE CAN DISPEL
THE PAIN OF POVERTY!

00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:13.620
WE CAN TAKE AWAY
YOUR TROUBLES FOREVER!

00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:19.493
WHAT'S THAT?

00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:20.994
I FEEL TINGLY.

00:17:20.994 --> 00:17:23.397
YOU SHALL FIGHT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:25.899
WE SHALL FIGHT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:28.669
WE SHALL FIGHT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON!
WE SHALL...

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:30.971
Rally: WHAT ARE THESE
CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS?!

00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:34.775
HUH?
HUH?

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:36.843
WELL, THEY BETTER BE
BECAUSE THE LAST THING

00:17:36.843 --> 00:17:38.679
YOU WANT TO DO IS FIGHT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:40.013
UH, RALLY...

00:17:40.013 --> 00:17:41.148
YOU SHOULD ALL
BE ASHAMED!

00:17:41.148 --> 00:17:43.350
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
HELPED YUSEI WIN!

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.485
'N' YOU'RE STANDING HERE
CHEERING AND TALKING BAD

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:48.055
ABOUT STUFF YOU
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT?!

00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:49.456
THE DRAGON HELPED YUSEI?

00:17:49.456 --> 00:17:51.391
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:53.593
THAT'S RIGHT!
SO HOW ABOUT
AN APOLOGY?!

00:17:53.593 --> 00:17:55.195
CAUSE WHEN YUSEI GETS
BACK, HE'LL PROVE

00:17:55.195 --> 00:17:57.230
TO ALL OF YOU THAT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.432
IS GOOD
FOR THE SATELLITE.
WILL YOU BE QUIET?!

00:17:58.432 --> 00:18:00.500
HEY! I GOTTA RIGHT
TO SAY WHAT I WANT!

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.302
BUT CHECK OUT
YOUR AUDIENCE!

00:18:02.302 --> 00:18:03.837
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF ZOMBIES WHO DON'T

00:18:03.837 --> 00:18:06.840
AGREE
WITH YOUR POINT OF VIEW!

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.308
YOU MIGHT HAVE
A POINT, NERVIN.

00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:13.714
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE NOW!

00:18:13.714 --> 00:18:17.951
[THINKING]
THE LITTLE ONE'S
GOT SOME GUTS.

00:18:17.951 --> 00:18:19.720
Rally:
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.688
WHY WOULD A REPORTER
WRITE AN ARTICLE SAYING

00:18:21.688 --> 00:18:23.123
THAT YUSEI
AIN'T THE CHAMP!

00:18:23.123 --> 00:18:24.624
WE WATCH'D IT LIVE!

00:18:24.624 --> 00:18:26.059
YEAH THERE WAS
THAT FLASH OF LIGHT,

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:27.494
AND NO ONE SAW WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED

00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:28.762
WHEN THEY
VAN'SHED BUT...

00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.163
TANK, STOP "HELPING."

00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:31.498
WE ALL SAW HIM WIN.

00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:32.466
YUSEI'S
THA ONE TRUE CHAMP!

00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:33.834
COME'ON, BLITZ!

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:35.702
THIS WHOLE THING'S
ABOUT CLASS WARFARE!

00:18:35.702 --> 00:18:37.270
PEOPLE DON'T WANT
SOME STREET URCHIN

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.006
FROM THE SATELLITE
AS THEIR NEW DUEL CHAMP!

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:43.710
Man: GOOD TO KNOW YUSEI'S
GOT SUCH "SUPPORTERS."

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.745
HEY!

00:18:44.745 --> 00:18:46.813
WHO ARE YOU?!

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:49.349
A FRIEND. BUT IF YUSEI
TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MANNERS,

00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:51.251
I MIGHT'VE STAYED HOME.

00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:53.253
Carly:
YUSEI'S A FRAUD??!!

00:18:53.253 --> 00:18:54.688
WHY WOULD ANGELA DO IT?!

00:18:54.688 --> 00:18:55.989
THERE'S NOT ONE
CREDIBLE SOURCE

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:57.457
IN THIS ENTIRE ARTICLE!

00:18:57.457 --> 00:19:00.160
HOW DARE SHE SMEAR
YUSEI LIKE THAT.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.661
SHE'S GONNA WISH
SHE NEVER WROTE THIS!

00:19:01.661 --> 00:19:04.364
Man: BE QUIET!

00:19:04.364 --> 00:19:05.832
HEY! YOU WANNA TALK?

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:08.068
SAVE IT FOR
THE INTERROGATION ROOM!

00:19:08.068 --> 00:19:11.805
IN-INTERROGATION?!

00:19:11.805 --> 00:19:14.908
WELL, I STILL
HAVE YOU.

00:19:14.908 --> 00:19:17.077
LET'S SEE WHAT MY
FORTUNE DECK SAYS NOW?!

00:19:17.077 --> 00:19:18.712
SUPER PINCH?!

00:19:18.712 --> 00:19:20.981
SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
IS THAT THIS IS GONNA BE
A BAD DAY?

00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:22.916
UH, DUH,
I'M STUCK IN JAIL,

00:19:22.916 --> 00:19:24.618
I LOST MY STORY,
AND NOW ANGELA'S

00:19:24.618 --> 00:19:27.020
PLASTERING THE HEADLINES
WITH LIES.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.288
WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU

00:19:28.288 --> 00:19:29.456
GONNA TRY TO TELL ME, HUH?!

00:19:29.456 --> 00:19:31.024
LISTEN UP IN THERE!

00:19:31.024 --> 00:19:33.360
I SAID BE QUIET!

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.530
I NEED A GET OUT
OF SECTOR SECURITY
FOR FREE CARD!

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:42.869
HEY. HOWZ IT GOIN'?

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:46.039
NOT GOOD, MY SEARCHES
ON SPIDER SYMBOLS AREN'T

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:48.108
TURNING UP
ANY SOLID LEADS.

00:19:48.108 --> 00:19:49.910
I KNOW YOU'LL FIND
A WAY TO SAVE

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.845
THE SATELLITE,
YUSEI!

00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:54.481
COUNT ON IT, YANAGI,
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA

00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:55.982
HAVE TO GET
SOME ANSWERS.

00:19:55.982 --> 00:19:57.350
AND ONLY ONE
PERSON HAS THEM.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.019
I NEED TO FIND GOODWIN.

00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.821
BUT YOU CAN'T
TRUST HIM!

00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:02.956
YEAH! YOU FORGET HE
LOCKED YOU UP?

00:20:02.956 --> 00:20:04.291
HE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND!

00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.092
BUT HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WITH ANSWERS.

00:20:06.092 --> 00:20:09.062
Luna: WHO?

00:20:09.062 --> 00:20:10.263
YOU'RE LEAVING,
BUT IT'S NOT SAFE

00:20:10.263 --> 00:20:11.298
FOR YOU OUT THERE!

00:20:11.298 --> 00:20:14.000
PLEASE DON'T GO!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.436
I HAVE TO. THE PEOPLE
IN THE SATELLITE ARE

00:20:16.436 --> 00:20:17.404
IN DANGER
AND I HAVE TO TRY

00:20:17.404 --> 00:20:18.572
AND HELP THEM SOME HOW.

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:19.840
STAY HERE!

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.508
YOU'LL, BE SAFER
IN THE CITY!

00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:22.609
CAUSE WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S OUT THERE!

00:20:22.609 --> 00:20:24.311
AND WHAT IF
IT'S TRUE!

00:20:24.311 --> 00:20:26.012
WHAT IF SOME
SPIDER'S
GONNA DESTROY

00:20:26.012 --> 00:20:27.347
ALL OF
THE SATELLITE?!

00:20:27.347 --> 00:20:28.949
HE'S RIGHT!
DON'T LEAVE!

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:31.751
WHAT IF YOU GET STUCK
AND CAN'T GET BACK
HERE EVER AGAIN?

00:20:39.025 --> 00:20:40.460
HUH?
HUH?

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.496
DON'T WORRY.
IN FACT, I ALREADY
MADE ARRANGEMENTS

00:20:43.496 --> 00:20:45.398
FOR SOME BACK UP.

00:20:45.398 --> 00:20:46.833
YOU'RE GETTING
A BODY GUARD?

00:20:48.168 --> 00:20:51.638
[SIRENS]

00:20:51.638 --> 00:20:52.873
HUH?
HUH?

00:20:55.175 --> 00:20:56.509
HEH.
HUH.

00:20:56.543 --> 00:20:58.745
LOOKS LIKE
MY RIDE'S HERE.

00:21:00.814 --> 00:21:03.283
ALRIGHT, YUSEI,
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

00:21:03.283 --> 00:21:05.518
NOW GET YOUR DECK
AND GET DOWN HERE!

00:21:05.552 --> 00:21:07.520
I'M NOT GONNA WAIT ALL
DAY JUST BECAUSE WE'RE

00:21:07.554 --> 00:21:10.624
TEAMING UP TEMPORARILY
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

00:21:10.624 --> 00:21:12.959
TRUDGE IS YOUR
"PROTECTION?!"

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:14.995
HE'S MORE.

00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:16.897
IF HE GETS ME
TO GOODWIN SAFELY,

00:21:16.897 --> 00:21:18.431
WE JUST MIGHT HAVE
TO CALL TRUDGE

00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:19.900
ONE OF
THE GOOD GUYS.

00:21:29.943 --> 00:21:31.244
WELL WHAT ARE WE
WAITIN' FOR?

00:21:31.244 --> 00:21:32.245
LET'S ROLL OUT!
