00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.512
Blister:
THIS IS THE PLACE, YUSEI.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.718
YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE
UNTIL THE FORTUNE CUP.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:19.152
NOT QUITE 5 STARS,

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.821
BUT IT'S GOT ALL
THE CREATURE COMFORTS

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:22.923
YOU WOULD EXPECT
FOR THIS PART OF TOWN...

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.026
COCKROACHES, MICE,
STRAY CAT.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.427
THANKS, I THINK.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.930
I DECORATED
THE PLACE MYSELF.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.799
HMM.
NOW GET SOME REST.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.935
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
RECOVERED FROM
THAT FALL YOU TOOK,

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.170
AND IF YOU PLAN ON
DUELING AND WINNING
THE FORTUNE CUP,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.739
YOU'LL NEED
A CLEAR HEAD.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.442
I'LL REST, BLISTER,
WHEN MY FRIENDS ARE SAFE.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.177
I HEAR YOU, YUSEI,

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.781
BUT YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ANYBODY
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ALL YOUR STRENGTH.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.953
DON'T WORRY.
I HEAL REAL QUICK...

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:57.724

NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.594
THE TOOTH FAIRY
FORGET YOU AGAIN?

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:11.064
LUNA, HE TOOK
HIS RUNNER AND LEFT.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:13.533
WELL, DID HE LEAVE
A NOTE OR SOMETHING?

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.736
NO.
HUH?

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.871
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICER.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.073
HE WAS GOING TO TEACH ME
TO BE THE BEST DUELIST EVER.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.776
WILL YOU CALM DOWN?
LOOK AT THESE.

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:27.180
OH, WHAT DID HE
DO TO THEM?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.316
IT FITS NOW.
SO, HOW DOES
IT LOOK, LUNA?

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.951
PRETTY GOOD.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:34.121
NOW I JUST WISH
WE KNEW WHO HE WAS
SO WE COULD THANK HIM.

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:36.456
WELL, IT'S HIS OWN FAULT
FOR NOT TELLING US HIS NAME.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:38.825
I MEAN, HE HAD AMNESIA.
WE HELPED HIM.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.861
IF HE WANTED A THANK YOU,
HE WOULD HAVE STAYED.

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.030
I GUESS SO,
BUT WHY NO GOOD-BYE?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.931
MAYBE HE WANDERS
THE CITY STREETS

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.733
AND HELPS OUT
STRUGGLING DUELISTS,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.836
KIND OF LIKE A KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR,
BUT WITH A DECK.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.004
A KNIGHT?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.406
SOUNDS MORE LIKE
A SUPERHERO,

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.307
AND HIS NAME'S
SOME BIG SECRET.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.511
HMM.
[RING]
HUH?

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.480
WHAT UP,
MY MAIN MAN?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.049
DEXTER, GET THIS.
SOME GUY...

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.017
PAUSE. THERE'S
NO TIME FOR THAT.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.054
I GOT US A LEAD.
A LEAD?

00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.789
DUH.
THE BLACK ROSE?

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.057
COME ON, DEX.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:12.759
THE BLACK ROSE IS JUST
SOME URBAN LEGEND.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.961
YOU MISS ME,
DEXTER?

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:16.697
UH, NO. LISTEN.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.365
THE BLACK ROSE
IS NO LEGEND.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.500
SHE'S
THE MOST AMAZING
DUELIST EVER.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.935
HER CARDS
COME ALIVE.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.170
I KNOW
WHERE SHE IS,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.938
AND I
REBUILT MY DECK
TO TAKE HER ON.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.907
SO, WHERE IS SHE,
DEXTER?

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.076
I WAS SCANNIN'
SOME BLOGS EARLIER
THIS MORNING,

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:30.577
AND CHECK THIS OUT.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.779
THERE'S A RUMOR GOING AROUND
SAYING SHE'S GOING TO POP UP

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.614
AT THE STREET DUELS
TODAY.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.383
THEN LET'S GO.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.619
LEO, HOW COME
YOUR DUEL DISK ISN'T
FALLING OFF ANYMORE?

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.323
RIGHT, SO THIS
SUPERHERO STOPS BY AND...

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:45.859
HE'S NOT A SUPERHERO,
DEXTER. HE'S A KNIGHT.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.661
WHAT'RE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:49.596
WHO FIXED UP
YOUR DUEL DISK?

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:52.032
OK. THIS GUY'S
DUEL RUNNER IS RED AND...

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.400
LEO...
HUH?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.102
UNTIL WE KNOW MORE
ABOUT THIS GUY,

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.137
MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP
THIS BETWEEN US.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:03:58.705
OK. GOOD POINT.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.674
Dexter: HEY,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.075
UH, NOTHING.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.376
WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.278
HOW MUCH WE REALLY LIKE
YOUR NEW BOW TIE.

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.681
LISTEN. WE GOT TO GO NOW.
SEE YA.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.083
LISTEN.
THIS IS OUR SECRET.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.219
HMM.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.156
LUNA, YOU THINK
MR. AMNESIA MAN
FLIES OR HAS A JET PACK?

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:24.865
SO, WHAT EXACTLY DID
THAT PURPLE-HAIRED FREAK

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:28.335
SAY TO YOU ABOUT DUELING
IN THE FORTUNE CUP?

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:31.238
WELL, HMM...

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:34.541
IT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID,
BUT WHAT HE SHOWED ME.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.644
HMM? HUH.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.885
SO, THESE ARE
YOUR FRIENDS, HUH?

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.053
YEAH, AND IF I DON'T
SHOW UP TO THE FORTUNE CUP,

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.756
GOODWIN SAID
THEY'D PAY THE PRICE.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.825
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
GOODWIN WOULD DO.

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.094
IF IT'S NOT A BRIBE,
IT'S A THREAT.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.563
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE IN THE SATELLITE?

00:04:56.563 --> 00:05:02.002
THEY ARE.
OH, MAN.

00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:05.505
LISTEN. I WANNA
HELP YOU OUT.
HMM?

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.907
I'LL CHECK ON THEM

00:05:06.907 --> 00:05:09.276
AND MAKE SURE
NOTHING BAD HAPPENS.

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.211
YOU CAN GET
TO THE SATELLITE?

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:13.880
I CAN GET
ANYWHERE, YUSEI.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.715
NOW, DON'T WORRY.

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:19.219
YOU'LL BE BACK WITH
YOUR BUDS IN NO TIME.

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.656
[THINKING] THAT'S IF GOODWIN
EVER LETS ME SEE THEM AGAIN.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.057
HOW'S YOUR TRAINING COMING ALONG
FOR THE FORTUNE CUP?

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:47.793
IF YOU MEAN SITTIN' ON
THE COUCH, JUST GREAT.

00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:50.963
WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE.

00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:53.499
I INVITED AN ADDITIONAL
CONTESTANT THIS YEAR,

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:55.167
SOMEONE YOU KNOW.
WHO?

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.336
YOUR FRIEND FROM
THE SATELLITE... YUSEI FUDO.

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.472
HE'LL BE THERE?
I LIKE.

00:06:00.472 --> 00:06:02.307
I'M GLAD.

00:06:02.307 --> 00:06:05.043
I HOPED IT WOULD
MOTIVATE YOU.

00:06:05.043 --> 00:06:07.413
WELL, I SHOULD
PROBABLY LET YOU

00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:10.649
GET BACK TO YOUR,
UH, TRAINING REGIMEN.

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.651
I'LL SHOW MYSELF OUT,

00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.255
AND, JACK, MAKE SURE
YOU WIN THIS TIME, OK?

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:20.559
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS, MINA?

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:21.860
UM...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.163
I CAN FINALLY
TAKE ON YUSEI AGAIN.

00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:27.933
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING,
ISN'T IT?

00:06:27.933 --> 00:06:29.968
IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:32.204
IT'S A CHANCE.

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:36.608
A CHANCE FOR WHAT
MR. ATLAS?

00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:40.279
A CHANCE
TO REDEEM MYSELF.

00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:44.750
I UNDERESTIMATED YUSEI
IN OUR LAST MATCH,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.986
BUT THIS TIME,
I'LL PROVE TO HIM
THAT I'M THE BEST.

00:06:47.986 --> 00:06:50.355
HMPH.
WHAT?
LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:52.324
I'M JUST GOING
TO GO AND EVEN UP
THE PLAYING FIELD

00:06:52.324 --> 00:06:54.326
SO THAT YUSEI
DEFINITELY SHOWS UP,

00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:57.062
AND IF I'M RIGHT
ABOUT THIS,

00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:59.398
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
JUST MIGHT SHOW UP

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.934
AT THE FORTUNE CUP,
AS WELL.

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:05.137

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:10.442

00:07:10.442 --> 00:07:13.178

WE DIDN'T JUST
GET EARLY RELEASE.

00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:44.376
WE GOT WAY
EARLY RELEASE,

00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:47.746
SO WE HEADED
RIGHT OVER TO, UM,
THIS INTERESTING...

00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:49.481
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP.

00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:52.451
WHY DON'T YOU
GET A THROW RUG AND WORK
SOME FENG SHUI IN HERE?

00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:54.319
TANNER, YOU SAID
YOU'D BE NICE.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.754
THAT WAS NICE.

00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:58.223
I'M LIKIN'

BET YOU WISH YOU HAD THAT
BACK IN THE FACILITY.

00:08:04.363 --> 00:08:06.632
WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU LET ME
TAKE IT FOR A LITTLE RIDE

00:08:06.632 --> 00:08:08.500
AND SEE WHAT SHE'S GOT?

00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:10.302
I'LL BRING IT BACK
WITH A FULL CHARGE

00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:11.904
AND NOT ONE SCRATCH.

00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:13.171
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:08:13.171 --> 00:08:15.107
YOU MEAN LIKE
YOUR LAST RUNNER?

00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:16.508
HOW ABOUT WE DUEL?

00:08:16.508 --> 00:08:19.144
I WIN, I TAKE HER
FOR A QUICK SPIN, OK?

00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:21.580
AAH! I GOT
TO SEE THIS.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.649
HMM.

00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:33.659
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR STORY?

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.694
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I'M A FAMOUS EXPLORER

00:08:35.694 --> 00:08:37.162

00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:43.101

YOUR DECK'S JUST A JOKE.

HE WHAT? HE DID NOT.

00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:46.838
JUST TAKE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF.

00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:50.375
I'VE GOT CRYSTAL SKULL,
ASHOKA PILLAR...
OK. GRANDPA.

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:52.511
[THINKING] WHERE DO YOU
FIND THESE GUYS, YUSEI?

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:54.379
AN EX-CHAMP YOU MET
IN THE FACILITY?

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:56.315
HE WENT FROM FOE TO FRIEND
IN ONE DUEL.

00:08:56.315 --> 00:08:58.917
THEN THERE OLD GRANDPA,
AND HE THINKS YOU'RE TIED

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.787

ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD.

WITH THAT CARD, YOU MADE
THE CRIMSON DRAGON APPEAR.

00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:03.859
BUT JACK
WAS THERE, TOO.

00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:06.729

YOU'RE BOTH SIGNERS.

TO THEIR LIMITS,

00:13:09.725 --> 00:13:13.262
