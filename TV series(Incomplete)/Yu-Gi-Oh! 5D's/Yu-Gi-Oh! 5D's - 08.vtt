Announcer: DOES JACK ATLAS
HAVE THE MOVES THAT MATTER

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:00.627
TO TAKE DOWN HUNTER PACE'S
NEW DECK?

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:03.430
THE WORD ON THE CIRCUIT IS THAT
ITS POWERFUL, IT'S MEAN,

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.365
AND IT'S HOTTER THAN HOT!

00:09:10.403 --> 00:09:12.072
IF EVERYONE HERE WANTS A SHOW,

00:09:12.072 --> 00:09:14.174
THEN I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOW!

00:09:14.174 --> 00:09:18.878
All:
GO, JACK! GO, JACK! GO, JACK!

00:09:18.878 --> 00:09:20.146
Jack, thinking:
GO ON, CHEER.

00:09:20.146 --> 00:09:23.183
SCREAM YOUR LUNGS OUT.
BUY SEASON TICKETS.

00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:26.653
CROWD AROUND YOUR TELEVISIONS
TO WITNESS THIS DECEIT.

00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:28.755
HEH. IT'S ALL A WASTE.

00:09:28.755 --> 00:09:31.024
YOU CAME TO SEE A CHAMPION?

00:09:31.024 --> 00:09:33.059
WELL, HE'S STUCK
IN A CELL SOMEWHERE.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:35.128
BUT IF YOU WANT A SHOW,
STEP RIGHT UP,

00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:39.566
I'M THE ALL-SINGING, ALL-DANCING
RUNNER-UP OF NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:42.302
Announcer: JACK ATLAS
AND HUNTER PACE ARE
AT THE STARTING BLOCKS.

00:09:42.302 --> 00:09:45.038
NOW LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE,
NEW DOMINO!

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:47.941
ARE YOU READY TO TURBO DUEL??!!

00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.644
I THINK IT'S FINALLY TIME TO
GET THINGS STARTED, DON'T YOU?!

00:09:51.644 --> 00:09:53.613
I'LL FIRE THINGS UP!

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:55.315
Computer: DUEL MODE ENGAGED.

00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.350
AUTOPILOT STANDING BY.

00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:02.155
TURBO DUELISTS.

00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.290
COUNTDOWN INITIATED.

00:10:08.294 --> 00:10:11.364
READY, SET, DUEL.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.302
HEY, HUNTER!
WATCH THIS!

00:10:16.302 --> 00:10:20.306
DARK RESONATOR, PUT UP
THE "BIG-D!"

00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.742
[GROWLING]

00:10:22.742 --> 00:10:26.446
Computer: DARK RESONATOR
IS A DARK ATTRIBUTE FIEND TYPE
TUNER MONSTER

00:10:26.446 --> 00:10:30.049
THAT CANNOT BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE ONCE A TURN.

00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:32.152
Announcer: JACK ATLAS IS OFF TO
AS STRONG A START

00:10:32.152 --> 00:10:33.787
AS I HAVE EVER SEEN.

00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:35.688
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO LET
HUNTER PACE KNOW

00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:38.224
THAT THIS TITLE IS HIS
AND HIS ALONE!

00:10:38.224 --> 00:10:41.227
HEH! SO IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO SCARE ME?!

00:10:41.227 --> 00:10:44.664
NO, BUT THESE TWO FACEDOWNS
SHOULD DO THE TRICK!

00:10:44.664 --> 00:10:46.166
Announcer: HUNTER
HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL,

00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:48.935
OR ONE OF THOSE FACEDOWNS COULD
LEAD TO AN EARLY EXIT

00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:50.637
FOR THE FORMER CHAMP.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.242
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

00:10:56.276 --> 00:10:58.678
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME A FEW
MOMENTS OF YOUR TIME,

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.847
I WILL EXPLAIN THE DETAILS
OF THE PILOT PROGRAM

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:03.116
THAT CHIEF ARMSTRONG
MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:11:03.116 --> 00:11:04.651
I'M SURE THAT MANY OF YOU FEEL

00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:06.986
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DEALT
A BAD HAND IN LIFE,

00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:09.355
BUT I HOPE TO CHANGE THAT.

00:11:09.355 --> 00:11:11.090
IN FACT, FOR ONE PERSON HERE,

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.593
NEW OPPORTUNITIES
ARE A HANDSHAKE AWAY.

00:11:13.593 --> 00:11:17.163
YOUR EXPERIENCES IN LIFE CAN BE
OF GREAT SERVICE TO THE CITY.

00:11:17.163 --> 00:11:19.499
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE DECIDED
TO SELECT ONE OF YOU

00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:21.868
TO TAKE UNDER MY WING.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:24.003
AND SHOULD THAT PERSON PROVE
HIMSELF HELPFUL

00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:25.905
TO ME AND THE CITY,

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:29.375
THEN I WILL BE MORE THAN
HAPPY TO RETURN THE FAVOR...

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:31.878
LIKE, SAY, A FULL PARDON,
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:33.112
A CLEAN RECORD,

00:11:33.112 --> 00:11:34.948
PERHAPS EVEN AN INVITE
TO LIVE HERE

00:11:34.948 --> 00:11:37.150
IN NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.253
AND NOW ITS JUST A MATTER OF
PICKING ONE OF YOU HERE

00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:42.121
TO COME AND ASSIST ME.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.421
DON'T GO LOSING
YOUR COOL, JACK, OK?

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.189
'CAUSE NOW IT'S MY TURN,

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:07.559
AND I'M PLANNING ON
TURNING UP THE HEAT
IN THIS PLACE, "CHAMP!"

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:09.728
STARTING WITH
SKULL CONDUCTOR!

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:11.096
SEE, LOSING TO YOU
LAST TIME

00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:12.498
CAUSED ME
A LOT OF PAIN,

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:14.500
BUT THAT WAS NOTHING
COMPARED TO THE AGONY

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.236
THAT THIS MONSTER CARD
IS ABOUT TO ORCHESTRATE!

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:20.772
BECAUSE AS SOON AS
I SEND OL' BONEY HERE
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:23.342
I CAN SUMMON OUT
TWO ZOMBIE TYPE
MONSTERS

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:26.612
WHO ARE JUST DYIN' TO
BURN UP SOME OF
YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.747
HA HA HA!

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:32.251
SAY HELLO TO MY TWO
BURNING SKULLHEADS!

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.586
Announcer: AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HUNTER PACE IS GOING ALL OUT

00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:38.223
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DUEL
DOESN'T END UP LIKE
THEIR LAST REMATCH.

00:12:38.223 --> 00:12:40.526
THEY SAY THAT TWO HEADS
ARE BETTER THAN ONE,

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.027
AND I COULDN'T
AGREE MORE,

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:45.063
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU
LOSE A THOUSAND
LIFE POINTS

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.799
FOR EACH SKULL HEAD
I HAVE ON THE FIELD!

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:50.168
LOOKS LIKE I'M HALFWAY
TO MY VICTORY LAP,

00:12:50.168 --> 00:12:51.904
DOESN'T IT, JACK?!

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.372
[GROANING]

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.841
[GASPING]

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:56.875
JACK!

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:57.910
OH, DEAR!

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.611
I CAN'T BEAR TO
WATCH THIS UNFOLD.

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.246
WELL, THEN KEEP
YOUR EYES COVERED,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.482
'CAUSE THERE'S
LOTS MORE TO COME!

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:06.385
AND I'LL START
BY RELEASING MY BURNING
SKULLHEADS

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:09.321
IN ORDER TO
SUMMON SKULL FLAME!

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:12.624
Announcer: HUNTER PACE CERTAINLY
HAS BROUGHT HIS "A" GAME

00:13:12.624 --> 00:13:14.192
WITH HIM TODAY, FOLKS,

00:13:14.192 --> 00:13:16.295
AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO
DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.397
TO MAKE JACK SWEAT THIS ONE OUT.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.099
NOW LETS SEE WHAT
HE'S GONNA FIRE UP NEXT.

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:22.801
WELL THIS SHOULD
SEND A SIGNAL
TO THE WORLD

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:25.837
THAT JACK'S
NUMBER ONE RANK IS ABOUT
TO GO UP IN SMOKE!

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:28.307
ANOTHER BURNING SKULL HEAD?!

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:32.110
SOMETHING TELLS ME HUNTER'S GOT
A BONE TO PICK WITH JACK ATLAS!

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.414
BURNING SKULL HEAD,
ATTACK!

00:13:35.414 --> 00:13:36.515
[GRUNTING]

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.719
OUR CHAMP'S DOWN TO HIS LAST
THOUSAND LIFE POINTS!

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:42.454
IT SEEMS LIKE WE ALL MIGHT BE
WITNESSING

00:13:42.454 --> 00:13:45.023
JACK ATLAS' UNDEFEATED STREAK
COME TO AN END!

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.625
HEAR THAT, ATLAS?

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:47.993
SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOUR FANS

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.596
HAVE ALREADY CHALKED
THIS ONE UP AS
A LOSS FOR YOU!

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:51.697
HEH HEH!

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.831
SO HAVE I,

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.133
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A LITTLE SURPRISE

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.069
WAITING FOR
YOU NEXT TURN:

00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:00.772
I GET TO SUMMON
ANOTHER BURNING
SKULL HEAD.

00:14:00.772 --> 00:14:03.642
THAT MEANS A THOUSAND
LESS LIFE POINTS
FOR YOU,

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:06.411
AND A CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE
FOR ME!

00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:07.679
HEH HEH HEH!

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:09.314
DON'T LOOK SO GLUM,
JACK.

00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:10.916
IF YOU EVER MISS
YOUR TITLE,

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:14.519
FEEL FREE TO CONTACT
MY AGENT FOR A REMATCH!

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.455
I'M SURE HE'LL BE ABLE

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.856
IN A YEAR OR TWO.

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.224
WHEN YOU TOOK MY TITLE,

00:14:19.224 --> 00:14:21.593
I LOST MY SPONSORS,
MY PAYCHECKS,

00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:23.695
MY HOUSE,
AND ALL MY FANS!

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.531
THEY SAY THAT REVENGE IS
A DISH BEST SERVED COLD,

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:30.335
BUT MY BURNING SKULLS
THINK HEATIN' IT UP
WORKS JUST FINE!

00:14:30.335 --> 00:14:32.571
Announcer: IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS LAST TURN!

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.574
IF JACK CAN'T STOP
HUNTER, HE'S FINISHED!

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:37.442
HUNTER'S NO YUSEI.

00:14:37.442 --> 00:14:40.078
HE'S THE SAME SORT OF TRASH
I ALWAYS BEAT.

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:43.115
AND IT'S ABOUT TIME
I TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE!

00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.354
EVERYBODY, BACK TO YOUR CELLS!
IMMEDIATELY!

00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:53.125
THE DIRECTOR'S MADE HIS
DECISION!

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.793
COME ON, MOVE IT!

00:14:56.728 --> 00:14:59.398
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, YUSEI.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.701
YOU'RE THE ONE THE DIRECTOR
HAS CHOSEN.

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:04.302
CAREFUL, YUSEI.

00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:11.543
SO TELL ME, MR. FUDO,

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.245
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE LITTLE EXPERIMENT

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:14.379
THAT I'VE PROPOSED?

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:16.014
I DON'T WANT
ANY PART OF IT.

00:15:16.014 --> 00:15:18.817
YOU'LL TAKE PART,
AND YOU'LL LIKE
IT, YOU INSU...

00:15:18.817 --> 00:15:21.086
OH, COME NOW, YUSEI.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:23.288
I KNOW YOU WANT
SOME ANSWERS.

00:15:23.288 --> 00:15:25.657
HUH? WHAT KIND OF ANSWERS,
GOODWIN?

00:15:25.657 --> 00:15:26.692
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:30.195
DON'T ACT SO COY, YUSEI

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.431
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
THAT MARK OF THE DRAGON

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:34.299
THAT APPEARED
ON YOUR ARM.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:36.501
REALLY?
THEN TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

00:15:36.501 --> 00:15:37.969
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:40.906
THAT IS WHAT I'M HOPING TO
UNCOVER WITH YOUR HELP.

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.541
I CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.710
WELL,
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.046
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA USE ME.

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:49.214
OF COURSE!

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:52.217
WE ALL USE EACH OTHER!
LOOK AT OUR CITY!

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.753
THE SATELLITE NEEDS
THE TRASH THAT
WE GIVE THEM.

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:56.621
AND THEY RECYCLE IT
FOR ENERGY AND HEAT

00:15:56.621 --> 00:15:58.824
THAT WE IN TURN USE,
YUSEI!

00:15:58.824 --> 00:16:02.461
IT'S NOT TRASH THAT WE NEED,
IT'S FREEDOM.

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.496
FINE! IT'S YOURS!

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.998
OH, YEAH? FOR WHAT?

00:16:06.998 --> 00:16:08.233
JUST COME WITH ME

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.402
SO I CAN STUDY YOUR MARK
OF THE DRAGON.

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.237
TOGETHER,
WE MAY BE ABLE TO UNLOCK

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.172
THE SECRETS
OF THE SIGNERS!

00:16:14.172 --> 00:16:15.807
BUT SAY NO,
AND, WELL,

00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:17.042
WITHOUT THAT KNOWLEDGE,

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.244
WE HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE
TO SEND YOU TO.

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:21.446
AND THEN WHO KNOWS
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOU

00:16:21.446 --> 00:16:22.881
ONCE YOU GET THERE?

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.116
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.484
WELL,
HERE IN THE FACILITY,

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.152
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.054
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES.

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.288
YES, YOU WILL.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.637
Announcer: WE'RE BACK!

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.939
AND JACK ATLAS HAS
THIS ONE CHANCE
TO STAY UNDEFEATED!

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:49.307
ENOUGH WARM-UP.

00:16:49.307 --> 00:16:52.210
ITS TIME I KICK
THIS DUEL INTO OVERDRIVE!

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:56.548
AND I'LL START
BY SUMMONING OUT
BIG PIECE GOLEM!

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:59.984
WHAT'S THIS?
IT APPEARS JACK IS
GOING FOR A FACEDOWN!

00:16:59.984 --> 00:17:01.352
YOU WANNA "FACEDOWN?"

00:17:01.352 --> 00:17:03.621
HOW'BOUT I BLAST YA
OFF YOUR RUNNER!

00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:04.722
FUNNY, HUNTER,

00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:06.658
BUT HE WHO LAUGHS LAST
LAUGHS BEST

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:08.293
AND MY REVIVAL
GIFT TRAP

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.128
SHOULD HAVE ME LAUGHING
ALL THE WAY TO VICTORY

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.863
SINCE I CAN NOW SUMMON
A TUNER MONSTER

00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.598
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:16.634
NEXT I BRING OUT
DARK RESONATOR!

00:17:16.634 --> 00:17:18.970

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.673
Announcer: WAIT!
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?!

00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:26.044
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME, PAL?!

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:29.781
THAT'S A SPECIAL EFFECT
OF THE TRAP REVIVAL GIFT!

00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:32.617
HUNTER GETS TWO MONSTER TOKENS
ON HIS FIELD,

00:17:32.617 --> 00:17:35.086
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT
THOSE TWO HAVE PLANNED?

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:36.721
OH. IS JACK GOING TO
COME BACK?!

00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:38.289
WILL HE OVERCOME
CERTAIN DEFEAT?!

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.492
WILL HE RETAIN
HIS TITLE AS CHAMPION?!

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:42.627
WILL HE KICK IT INTO
OVER-DRIVE?!

00:17:42.627 --> 00:17:44.863
WELL, LET'S FIND OUT,
SHALL WE?!

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:48.133
RESONATOR, TIME TO
UPGRADE OUR GOLEM!

00:17:50.568 --> 00:17:53.872
[ROAR]

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.440
AND WITH HIM ON MY FIELD,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.376
I CAN SUMMON RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND!

00:18:03.281 --> 00:18:05.517
TALK ABOUT SAVING
THE BEST FOR LAST!

00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:08.386
JACK ATLAS UNLEASHES HIS
MOST POWERFUL MONSTER!

00:18:08.386 --> 00:18:10.889
NOW, LET'S GET FIRED UP!

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.292
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:16.394
ARCHFIEND, ATTAAAACK!

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:21.866
OUCH! THAT'S GOTTA HURT!

00:18:21.866 --> 00:18:24.469
HUNTER'S SKULL HEAD IS DUST,
OR SHOULD I SAY, SMOKE!

00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:25.803
N'THE TOKENS, TOO!

00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:27.906
ARCHFIEND'S JUST GETTIN'
WARMED UP!

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:31.009
WOW! NOW, THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:33.144
AS SOON AS IT DESTROYS
ANY MONSTER IN DEFENSE,

00:18:33.144 --> 00:18:37.549
ALL THE OTHERS GET A ONE-WAY
TICKET TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.450
NOW, I'LL PLAY MY TRAP:

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.020
LINEAGE OF DESTRUCTION!

00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:45.523
Computer:
WITH LINEAGE OF DESTRUCTION,

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:47.759
THE NUMBER OF TIMES
YOUR MONSTER CAN ATTACK

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:50.428
IS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER
OF YOUR OPPONENT'S
MONSTERS DESTROYED

00:18:50.428 --> 00:18:51.996
WHILE IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.731
Announcer: AND IT APPEARS JACK
HAS PLAYED THIS MATCH

00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:57.168
WITH THE SKILL AND POISE OF
THE TRUE CHAMPION THAT HE IS.

00:18:57.168 --> 00:18:59.771
AND IT SEEMS RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND IS READY

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.372
TO FINISH THINGS OFF!

00:19:01.372 --> 00:19:02.907
[ROARING]

00:19:02.907 --> 00:19:04.075
HUNTER!

00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:06.511
HOPE BY NOW YOU LEARNED
NOT TO PLAY WITH FIRE!

00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:09.881
'CAUSE YOUR CAREER'S
ABOUT TO GO UP IN FLAMES AGAIN!

00:19:09.881 --> 00:19:11.749
IS IT TOO LATE
TO SAY SORRY?

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:12.750
PLEASE?

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.252
GO AHEAD,

00:19:14.252 --> 00:19:15.820
BUT I GUARANTEE
IT WON'T HELP YA
AGAINST HIM!

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.223
ATTACK,
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.658
SHOW NO MERCY!

00:19:21.526 --> 00:19:22.660
AAH!

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.866
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
OF THIS, HUNTER?

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:30.001
YOU MAY LOSE,

00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:33.104
BUT AT LEAST IT MAKES
FOR GREAT TELEVISION!

00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:34.272
[GRUNTING]

00:19:34.272 --> 00:19:35.640
NICE LITTLE DRAGON.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.576
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO ATTACK ME,
DO YA?

00:19:40.078 --> 00:19:41.179
AAH!

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.247
Announcer:
FLAME ON!

00:19:42.247 --> 00:19:46.551
HUNTER PACE IS DOWN
TO HIS LAST 600 POINTS!

00:19:46.584 --> 00:19:49.354
DON'T FEEL TOO BAD,
YOU'RE JUST A WARM-UP.

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.822
ONCE WE'RE FINISHED,

00:19:50.822 --> 00:19:53.958
I'VE GOT A REMATCH WITH
AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.860
SO, THANKS
FOR THE PRACTICE!

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.928
HUH?

00:19:56.928 --> 00:19:59.497
IT'S TIME
TO LOSE A THIRD TIME!

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:02.033
ARCHFIEND, END THIS!

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:05.103
AAH!

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:16.381
THEY SAY THAT 3 TIMES'
A CHARM, HUNTER,

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.884
BUT I HAVE A FEELING
THAT YOUR SPONSORS
WON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

00:20:19.884 --> 00:20:23.021
MAYBE YOU'D BE BETTER OFF
CHANGING BRAKE PADS
FOR A LIVING.

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:25.556
OHH.

00:20:25.556 --> 00:20:27.859
Announcer: JACK ATLAS WINS!

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.061
IN A DUEL THAT'S SURE TO GO DOWN
IN HISTORY,

00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:32.230
JACK TURNS CERTAIN DEFEAT
INTO VICTORY

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.333
OVER FORMER CHAMP HUNTER PACE!

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:38.503
WHO'S THE MASTER OF FASTER?
WHO RULES THE DUELS?

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:43.041
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S ME,
JACK ATLAS!

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.743
[ECHOING]

00:20:45.743 --> 00:20:48.279
[THINKING]
AND NEXT TIME I MEET YUSEI FUDO,

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:51.316
I'LL PROVE IT,
ONCE AND FOR ALL!
