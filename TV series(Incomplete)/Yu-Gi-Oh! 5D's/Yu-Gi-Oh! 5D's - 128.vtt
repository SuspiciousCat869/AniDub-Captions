00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.251
THE PERSON WHOSE RESEARCH
BROUGHT ABOUT ZERO REVERSE

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.354
WAS YOUR FATHER,
WAS IT NOT, YUSEI?

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:16.356
AND SINCE YOU'RE
OF HIS BLOODLINE,

00:09:16.356 --> 00:09:19.793
YOU HAVE IT IN YOU TO CAUSE THE
SAME DAMAGE HIS RESEARCH DID.

00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:23.329
MY HEART DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE
WHAT YOU SAID COULD BE TRUE.

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:26.099
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
A DREAM ABOUT MY FATHER.

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:30.336
IN IT, HE WARNED ME
ABOUT A GREAT DANGER.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:34.040
YUSEI, THE POWER OF THE FORCE
YOU SEE BEFORE YOU

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.476
MUST NEVER REACH YOUR WORLD.

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:38.411
HUH?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.779
AHH.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.118
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT THING IS NOW,

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:46.719
IT'S MY FATHER'S SHADOW.

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:48.688
YOUR FATHER'S SHADOW?

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:51.524
YOU SEE, I WAS BORN
ON THE SAME DAY

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.293
THAT THIS CITY
NEARLY PERISHED.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.535
[CRYING]

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.608
WAS IT COINCIDENCE
OR WAS IT SOMETHING MUCH MORE?

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.010
SOMETHING THAT HAS
TO DO WITH THE FUDO FAMILY.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.447
EVEN THOUGH ZERO REVERSE
WAS NOT MY FATHER'S FAULT,

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.549
HE WAS A PART OF IT.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:19.018
SO MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT MY BLOODLINE

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.520
THAT BRINGS DOOM AND DESPAIR.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.755
AND IF THAT TURNS
OUT TO BE THE CASE,

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:24.524
THEN I'LL DO WHAT
I MUST TO STOP IT.

00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:26.759
JUST AS I'M GOING TO
STOP TEAM NEW WORLD.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.695
YOU SEE I'VE REALIZED
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:32.031
NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IN
NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.602
THE ONLY THING I CAN CONTROL
IS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:37.871
SO THAT'S JUST
WHAT I PLAN TO DO.

00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.506
I SEE.

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.808
SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:45.211
NO, HALLDOR, THERE'S NO WAY
I'LL EVER SURRENDER.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.412
[ELECTRONIC NOISE]

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.515
HUH?

00:10:48.515 --> 00:10:49.916
IT'S COMING.

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:00.493
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:03.863
THAT'S THE MARK OF
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.432
YES, BECAUSE HE'S THE
ONLY ONE STRONG ENOUGH

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.301
TO TAKE ON YOUR NORDIC GODS.

00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:10.970
NOW THEN, IT'S MY TURN.

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:18.311
I PLAY THE SPEED SPELL
ANGEL BATON!

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.080
SINCE I HAVE AT LEAST
TWO SPEED COUNTERS

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.550
I CAN DRAW TWO ADDITIONAL
CARDS FROM MY DECK

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.920
BY SENDING ONE CARD IN
MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.089
NEXT I SUMMON FORTH
DEBRIS DRAGON.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.663
IT'S A TUNER MONSTER,
HE'S PLANNING A SYNCHRO.

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:38.531
AND WHEN DEBRIS
DRAGON IS SUMMONED,

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.634
I GET TO SUMMON A MONSTER
WITH 500 OR LESS ATTACK POINTS

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:43.570
STRAIGHT FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.540
AND THE MONSTER I CHOOSE
IS COSMIC COMPASS.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.742
AND NOW, SINCE A TUNER
IS ON MY FIELD,

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:53.279
I CAN SUMMON FROM MY GRAVEYARD
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG.

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:59.018
NEXT UP, BECAUSE A MONSTER
WAS SUMMONED FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.287
I CAN SUMMON
THIS MONSTER FROM MY HAND,

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.089
DOPPELWARRIOR.

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.427
BUT I'M NOT THROUGH YET.

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:11.831
DOPPELWARRIOR,
TUNE WITH QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
AND DEBRIS DRAGON.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.367
NOW, OUT OF THREE
WILL COME ONE.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.537
AND OUT OF ONE WILL
COME GREAT COSMIC MIGHT.

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:21.641
I SYNCHRO SUMMON THE SYNCHRO
MONSTER STARDUST DRAGON.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:25.478
YOUR ULTIMATE BEAST.

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.614
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,
STARDUST DRAGON

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:30.216
IS STILL NO MATCH
FOR MY THREE NORDIC GODS.

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:32.452
I ACTIVATE
DOPPELWARRIOR'S ABILITY.

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:34.821
WHEN IT'S USED
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:38.458
I'M ALLOWED TO BRING OUT ONE
DOPPELWARRIOR TOKEN TO MY FIELD.

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:44.130
THEN FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED SPELL OVERTUNE.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.367
DUE TO OVERTUNE, SINCE
I HAVE FIVE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.637
I'M NOW ALLOWED TO RELEASE
ONE MONSTER ON MY FIELD.

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:53.640
AND IN EXCHANGE, I CAN SUMMON
ONE TUNER MONSTER FROM MY HAND

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.874
THAT HAS THE SAME LEVEL.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.843
WAIT, JUST WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:59.779
I RELEASE LEVEL ONE DOPPEL TOKEN

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.081
AND SUMMON MAJESTIC DRAGON.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.123
NOW COSMIC COMPASS
AND MAJESTIC DRAGON

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:12.091
TUNE WITH STARDUST DRAGON.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.362
[ROARING]

00:13:16.362 --> 00:13:18.798
YOU WERE WRONG WHEN YOU
CALLED STARDUST DRAGON

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.867
MY ULTIMATE BEAST, HALLDOR.

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:23.703
THIS IS MY ULTIMATE BEAST.

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:25.204
I NOW SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:27.974
THE MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON.

00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:33.746
Computer: <i>Majestic</i>
<i>star dragon is a level 10</i>

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:36.549
<i>dragon type monster</i>
<i>with 3,800 attack points</i>

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.118
<i>and 3,000 defense points.</i>

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:40.253
YES, YUSEI!

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:41.554
HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IT.

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:44.924
HE'S HARNESSED THE POWER
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:13:57.537 --> 00:14:00.306
[ROARING]

00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:02.075
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT?

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:04.277
DON'T KNOW, THAT CARD'S
NOT IN OUR SYSTEM.

00:14:04.277 --> 00:14:06.212
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT BEAST.

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:15.288
THIS MONSTER IS THE INCARNATION
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:18.091
NO MATTER, HE CANNOT ATTACK.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.895
AW, HALLDOR'S RIGHT.

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:26.132
THE MONSTER CHAIN TRAP YUSEI
PLAYED HASN'T EXPIRED YET.

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.101
YEAH, AND UNTIL IT DOES,

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:31.170
YUSEI'S MONSTERS CAN'T
MAKE ANY OFFENSIVE MOVES.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.042
NOW, SINCE COSMIC COMPASS
WAS USED TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.044
I GET TO MAKE
AN ADDITIONAL DRAW.

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:43.216
ALL RIGHT,
NEXT I THROW DOWN A FACEDOWN.

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.585
THEN END MY TURN.

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:48.554
AND NOW THAT I HAVE,
I ACTIVATE A FACEDOWN.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.690
THE TRAP STAY FORCE.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.093
NOW BY PAYING A THOUSAND LIFE
POINTS DURING THE END PHASE
OF MY TURN,

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:58.264
I CAN NEGATE MY DRAGON'S ABILITY
THAT MAKES HIM LEAVE THE FIELD.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.066
IT'S YOUR DRAW NOW.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:01.501
I SMELL A RAT.

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:03.336
YUSEI'S PLANNING SOMETHING.

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:04.837
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, DRAGAN.

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:07.740
OUR NORDIC GODS ARE GONNA
END THIS HERE AND NOW.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.511
AND THERE'S NOT A THING
YUSEI CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.946
IT'S MY TURN.

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:17.483
DEAR YUSEI, I APPLAUD
YOUR EFFORT TO KEEP FIGHTING,

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:21.053
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
ODIN OUTMATCHES YOUR DRAGON

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:22.855
BY 200 POINTS.

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.457
AND EVEN IF HE DIDN'T,

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:26.526
YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT
I'VE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:29.128
THAT WILL SECURE
MY VICTORY REGARDLESS.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.130
PRECAUTIONS SUCH AS THIS ONE:

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.133
I ACTIVATE A TRAP CARD,
ODIN'S EYE!

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.868
AND I'M AFRAID, YUSEI,

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:38.271
THAT YOUR MAJESTIC STAR
DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:41.140
ISN'T ABLE TO NEGATE
THE EFFECT OF THIS CARD.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.375
IT'S NOT?

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.343
THAT'S RIGHT,
WHEN A GOD IS ON THE FIELD,

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:47.113
NOTHING CAN NEGATE
THE GAZE OF ODIN'S EYE.

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:50.349
AND THAT BEING THE CASE,
THIS TRAP ACTIVATES.

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:53.119
NOW BY NEGATING
THE ABILITIES OF A GOD CARD,

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:57.290
I'M ALLOWED TO LOOK AT YOUR HAND
OR A FACEDOWN ON YOUR FIELD.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.559
AND I THINK I'LL
CHOOSE TO LOOK AT

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:01.661
YOUR FACEDOWN, YUSEI.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.037
I SEE, HOW INTERESTING.

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:14.874
YOUR FACEDOWN CARD
IS WAVE REBOUND.

00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:16.843
THAT MEANS THAT
ON THIS VERY TURN,

00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:19.178
IF A SYNCHRO WAS SUMMONED
FROM THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.947
YOU COULD NEGATE
THAT SUMMONING

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:23.316
AND THEN YOU COULD DEAL
DAMAGE EQUAL TO WHAT

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.685
THAT SYNCHRO'S
ATTACK POINTS WERE.

00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:28.721
AH, NOW I THINK I KNOW WHAT
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE DRAGON

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:30.823
WERE PLANNING TO
PULL ON ME, YUSEI.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:33.593
WHY, MY RUNE EYE LET'S
ME SEE THE FUTURE.

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:36.229
I WOULD USE ODIN AND
YOU WOULD FOLLOW WITH--

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:39.031
THAT'S JUST WHAT
I WAS HOPING FOR.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.834
I NOW PLAY MAJESTIC
STAR DRAGON'S ABILITY.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:45.705
IT ACTIVATES WHEN YOU USE
THE EFFECT OF A SPELL,
TRAP, OR MONSTER.

00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:48.174
NOW, BY RELEASING
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON,

00:16:48.174 --> 00:16:52.011
ODIN'S EFFECT IS STOPPED
AND ALL THE CARDS ON YOUR
FIELD ARE DESTROYED.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:55.915
[CRASHING]

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:58.951
NEXT I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP WAVE REBOUND.

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:00.786
WHICH MEANS AT THE END
OF THIS TURN,

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:03.055
YOU CAN'T BRING BACK
YOUR NORDIC GODS

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.858
AND YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THEIR ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.533
A VERY CUNNING SCHEME
YOU HAVE PLANNED.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.202
AND I DO BELIEVE IF YOU
MANAGE TO EXECUTE YOUR SCHEME

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:19.071
AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT,
YOU'LL WIN THE DUEL.

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:21.240
HOWEVER, I THINK YOU
KNOW QUITE WELL,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.842
I WON'T BE LETTING THAT HAPPEN.

00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:24.577
NOT A CHANCE.

00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:27.179
NOT SINCE I'VE SEEN IT COMING.

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:30.883
[THINKING]
LOOKS LIKE IT'S BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD.

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.685
IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE, REALLY.

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:35.421
AS IMPOSSIBLE AS IT IS
FOR YUSEI TO WIN THIS,

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.789
HE STILL ENDURES.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:39.692
AH, YUSEI,
THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE.

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:41.994
PERHAPS IT'S NOT
AS EXCITING FOR THE CROWD,

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.430
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
IT'S EXCITING FOR ME.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.833
AFTER ALL, THE VERY BEST PART
OF A CHESS MATCH SUCH AS THIS,

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:51.270
IS THE MOMENT THE PLAYERS
JUST SIT AND STRATEGIZE.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.040
AND GIVEN THE PRESENT STATE
OF THIS DUEL OF OURS,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.742
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE NOW MUST DO NOW.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:18:00.212
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.747
IT'S YOUR DRAW.

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:04.684
WELL, YOU HEARD IT
FROM HALLDOR HIMSELF.

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:07.520
SEEMS THESE TWO DUELISTS
CAN'T DO A THING UNTIL THAT

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.522
MONSTER CHAIN TRAP SNAPS.

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:12.725
THEN, AND ONLY THEN,
WILL A WINNER EMERGE.

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:16.128
IF ONLY YUSEI HAD BEEN
ABLE TO GET OFF HIS TRAP.

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:18.431
BUT HE DIDN'T GET IT OFF,
CROW, AND THAT'S THAT.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.067
IT'S LIKE HE SAID,
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:23.402
BUT YOU CAN CONTROL
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.339
OF COURSE BY THAT LOGIC,
HALLDOR CAN, TOO.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.041
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
DUE TO YUSEI'S STAY FORCE TRAP,

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.544
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON
CAN STAY OUT THREE MORE TURNS.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:33.245
BUT YOU HAVE
TO REMEMBER, BRUNO,

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:36.582
MONSTER CHAIN'S EFFECT WILL
END ON YUSEI'S NEXT TURN.

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:40.186
AND WHEN IT DOES,
THERE ARE GOING TO BE
SOME SERIOUS FIREWORKS.

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:42.088
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN, AKIZA,

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:44.657
BECAUSE THAT'LL BE THE MOMENT
WHEN ALL OF THIS IS SETTLED.

00:18:44.657 --> 00:18:47.360
WILL YUSEI WIN OR LOSE?

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.808
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:04.377
IT'S MY TURN.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:05.578
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:08.147
FIRST I USE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:11.150
NOW BY REMOVING
SEVEN OF MY SPEED COUNTERS,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.519
I CAN DRAW AN EXTRA CARD.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.789
NEXT, TO SUSTAIN THE EFFECT
OF THE TRAP STAY FORCE,

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:18.724
I'LL PAY A THOUSAND LIFE POINTS.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.459
NOW MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.762
NO LONGER HAS
TO LEAVE THE FIELD.

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:25.431
WITH THAT,
I END MY TURN.

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:27.400
IT'S MY DRAW.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.634
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:32.605
NOW THEN, TIME TO END
THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:35.307
THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI,
I KNOW THE PREVAILING WISDOM

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:37.743
HAS US ALL WAITING FOR
MONSTER CHAIN TO EXPIRE,

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:40.346
BUT IT'S LIKE I SAID...
HUH?

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.148
THE BEST PART OF A DUEL

00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:44.817
IS WHEN THE PLAYERS
TAKE TIME TO STRATEGIZE.

00:19:44.817 --> 00:19:47.186
WELL, I HAVE
STRATEGIZED, YUSEI.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:49.789
AND NOW I'M READY TO
IMPLEMENT THAT STRATEGY.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:53.259
SO HERE IT COMES,
ODIN, FATHER OF THE AESIR,

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:56.762
I ACTIVATE
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:59.865
GO COMMAND OF RUNE.
WHAT?

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:02.168
HE'S USING ODIN'S
POWER AFTER ALL?

00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:05.071
BUT WHY? YUSEI'S ALL
SET UP TO EXPLOIT IT.

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:06.605
NOW, THE MONSTER CHAIN TRAP

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:09.542
THAT IS AFFECTING
ODIN IS NEGATED.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:12.778
THEN I PLAY MY MAJESTIC
STAR DRAGON'S EFFECT.

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:16.582
AS YOU WELL KNOW, HALLDOR,
WHEN YOU ACTIVATE ODIN'S ABILITY

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:20.319
I CAN RELEASE MAJESTIC STAR
DRAGON AND NEGATE THAT ABILITY.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.456
THEN, ALL THE CARDS ON
YOUR FIELD ARE DESTROYED.

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:26.592
THAT IS THE POWER
OF STARDUST FORCE.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.637
[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:41.207
[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.981
[CHUCKLING]

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.257
I'LL NOW PLACE A CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.726
WHICH MEANS
WE'RE AT THE END PHASE

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:03.262
AND MY NORDIC GODS RETURN.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:10.569
SO RISE, THOR, LOKI, AND
OF COURSE, MIGHTY ODIN.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.838
[LIGHTNING CRASHES]

00:21:18.544 --> 00:21:21.514
[ROAR]

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:28.187
YOU ASKED FOR IT, HALLDOR.

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:31.157
I PLAY MY TRAP,
WAVE REBOUND.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.659
ANNOUNCER:
SIMPLY SENSATIONAL.

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:37.263
DUE TO WAVE REBOUND, ALL OF
TEAM RAGNAROK'S NORDIC GODS

00:21:37.263 --> 00:21:39.598
WILL BE WAVING
THEIR LAST GOOD-BYES.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:42.535
AND NOW, HALLDOR
WILL TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THE ATTACK POINTS

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.337
OF ALL THREE OF THOSE
CLOBBERING CONQUERORS.

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:48.040
TELL ME, YUSEI,
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR PLAN?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.142
BECAUSE I AM HAPPY WITH IT.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:53.312
IN FACT, I COULDN'T BE
HAPPIER, AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:56.015
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SHOW ME.

00:21:56.015 --> 00:21:58.951
I ACTIVATE A TRAP
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:21:58.951 --> 00:22:01.253
A TRAP FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD?

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:03.489
THAT'S CORRECT.
GJALLARHORN.

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:07.293
THIS TRAP UNLEASHES ITS EFFECT
ONLY WHEN SIX FEET UNDER.

00:22:07.293 --> 00:22:09.562
AND IT'S QUITE THE EFFECT.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.633
[HORN BLARING]

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:16.402
DO YOU HEAR THAT, YUSEI?

00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:19.338
THAT'S THE SOUND OF YOUR
COMPLETE AND UTTER DESTRUCTION.

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.707
THAT'S THE SOUND OF VICTORY.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:23.709
AND IT IS GETTING LOUDER.

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:27.813
YUSEI, PREPARE TO FEEL
THE FULL WRATH OF THE
NORDIC GODS.
