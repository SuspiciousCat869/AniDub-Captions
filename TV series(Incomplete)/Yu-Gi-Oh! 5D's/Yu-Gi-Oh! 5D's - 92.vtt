IT AT THE TOP OF MY DECK.

WHEN I DRAW
THIS CARD AGAIN

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:59.539
I SEND IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.041
Lawton thinking:
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE...

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.042

I'M GONNA DRAW

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.410
THE TOP CARD
ON MY DECK,

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:08.248

GET SLAMMED WITH 4800 POINTS

LAWTON.

HOWEVER, IF THIS CARD
ISN'T A MONSTER CARD,

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:18.024
THEN I TAKE 4000
POINTS OF DAMAGE,

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:20.493
WHICH WOULD SLAP ME WITH
THE THREE DOOM COUNTERS

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.662
REQUIRED TO
FINISH ME OFF.

HE'LL HAVE TO DRAW A CARD.

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:38.511
IT'S A SPELL CARD.

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.680
WHICH MEANS THE MOMENT
HE USES DOOM SLINGER,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.916
HE'S GONNA BE
OUT OF THIS DUEL.

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.018

GOT TO FIGURE OUT
