WEBVTT

00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:03.003
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.440
IF WE'RE GONNA RESCUE
OUR DAD FROM THE MINES,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.308
THEN WE'RE GONNA
NEED SOME HELP,

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:09.443
AND WHO BETTER
TO HAVE OUR BACKS

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.144
THAN KALIN AND
THAT YUSEI FELLA?

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.447
RIGHT.
LET'S JUST HOPE
WE CAN FIND 'EM.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.016
HUH?

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.152
IS THAT YOU,
WEST, NICO?

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.054
IT'S KALIN.
AND YUSEI.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.393
Lawton: I HAD A HUNCH IN MY GUT
THAT YUSEI FELLA

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.529
WOULDN'T JUST LAY DOWN
AND WORK THE MINES

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.397
LIKE A GOOD LITTLE PRISONER.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.133
THIS WAY,
YOU TWO.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.002
ARE WE GONNA DUEL,
OR WHAT?

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.703
WITH PLEASURE.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.607
FASTER. COME ON.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.242
YOU CAN RUN...

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.111
BUT YA CAN'T HIDE.

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:45.879
GET IN THE CART.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.014
AAH!
AAH!

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.262
DON'T TRY ANYTHING,
OR ELSE.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.765
KALIN.
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.267
JUST BE READY
FOR MY SIGNAL. GO!

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.373
WHAT'S
THE HOLD UP? HMM?

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.643
OVER THERE.
IT'S HIM.
FATHER.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.179
HA HA!
HA HA!

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.548
IT'S FATE.
IT LED US RIGHT TO HIM.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.758
I'VE MISSED YOU.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:33.527
[THINKING] AND UNLESS
WE FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO SLIP THESE GUARDS,

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:36.296
WE'LL MISS OUR ONE
CHANCE AT ESCAPE.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:39.299
NOW TURRET WARRIOR,
ATTACK FULL ARMOR OGRE.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.171
I'M NOW ALLOWED
TO BRING A MONSTER

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.840
THAT WILL BLAST YOUR
LIFE POINTS DOWN TO ZERO,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.508
AND IF I DRAW
A TRAP CARD,

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.212
THANKS TO
GATLING OGRE'S ABILITY,
IT'LL BE LIGHTS OUT, TOO.

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.614
IN OTHER WORDS, YUSEI,

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.617
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
ON THIS NEXT DRAW,

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:59.453

Guard:
COME ON, BOYS.

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.699
WE GOTTA TAKE THIS
RIFF-RIFF DOWN N'
HAUL 'EM BACK.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.968

GET DOWN, SON.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.377
ROUND 'EM UP, BOYS.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.046

ARE A REAL THORN IN MY SIDE.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.896
HEH HEH HEH.
COLLAR 'EM.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:52.566
UH!

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:53.900
Kalin: [THINKING]
THEY'VE ACTIVATED
HIS COLLAR.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.837
I'VE GOTTA
DO SOMETHING.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.705
KALIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.776
HUH?
UH!

00:04:04.945 --> 00:04:06.947
UGH! UH!

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.483
ARE YOU OK?

00:04:09.483 --> 00:04:11.785
West: BEHIND YOU!

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:15.388
YOU WANNA DANCE,
PUNK? COME ON!

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.423
UH!

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:21.061
STAY ON, KALIN.
DON'T FALL.

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.363
KALIN!

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:24.898
AAH!

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:29.770
NICO.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:36.376
CAN'T YOU DRIVE?
THEY'RE GETTIN' AWAY.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.744
HOLD ON.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.663
[STRAINING]

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.131
NICO, HANG ON.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.867
[BOTH STRAINING]

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:04.137
I'LL BE FINE, NICO.
JUST LET GO.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:07.874
NO WAY.
I'M NOT LETTING GO.
WE'RE GETTING OUT TOGETHER.

00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:09.843
IT'S OK.

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:11.378
NO. IT'S NOT OK.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:14.514
YOU SAVED MY DAD.
NOW LET ME SAVE YOU.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.029
YOU'RE OK.
DEEP BREATHS.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.697
CAN YOU STAND?

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.802
Kalin: NICE WORK.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:39.039
West:
YOU GOOD TO GO?
MM-HMM.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.608
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
YOU SAVED MINE.

00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:43.510
I'M FREE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.978
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:46.880
FIRST OF ALL,
WE'RE NOT FREE YET,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.748
AND SECOND OF ALL,
YOU'RE IN THIS MINE

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.383
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE
LIKE ME.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:53.353
I'M NOT HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.122
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.724
IT'S MY OWN FAULT.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:00.961
NOTHING I DID EVER WENT RIGHT,
AND I COULDN'T MAKE ENDS MEET.

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:03.897
SO I CAME TO CRASH TOWN
LOOKING FOR AN EASY WAY OUT.

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.432
HAPPY TRAILS.

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.236
Nico:
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.770
YOU WON.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.939
Sergio, voice-over:
FINALLY, I WAS GETTING
TO SHOW MY LITTLE ONES

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.075
THAT THEIR DAD COULD DO
SOMETHING WITH HIMSELF,

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:17.644
THAT I COULD BE SOMEBODY
AND TAKE CARE OF US.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:19.913
ALL MY LIFE, I'D NEVER REACHED
MY TRUE POTENTIAL,

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:22.415
BUT THINGS WERE FINALLY
TURNING AROUND,

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.317
BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST FOREVER.

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.157
HA HA HA!

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:33.960
AAH!
DON'T DO IT, PLEASE.
GIMME ANOTHER CHANCE.

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.736
DADDY!
COME BACK WITH HIM.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.738
I KNEW THE DEAL
WHEN I SIGNED UP.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.841
I WAS A DESPERATE MAN,
KALIN, A DESPERATE MAN

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:49.776
WHO FELT LIKE HE
HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:54.814
IN FACT, PART OF ME THINKS
I WANTED TO END UP DOWN HERE.

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.850
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR KIDS?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.286
A MAN CAN GET SO BLINDED
BY SELF-PITY,

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:02.422
HE FORGETS THAT HE'S GOT
SOMETHING WORTH LIVING FOR.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.591
I THINK A LOTTA MEN
WHO COME HERE ARE LIKE THAT.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.493
THEY'VE LOST THEIR WILL
TO FIGHT ON,

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:09.229
AND THEY COME HERE
READY TO LOSE, BUT NOT YOU.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.064
YOU STILL GOT
SOME FIGHT IN YOU.

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:13.967
YOU'RE STILL STRONG.

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.936
EVEN IN THIS DARK PLACE,
YOU SEE LIGHT--

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.871
I KNOW YOU DO--
AND BY RISKING YOUR HIDE

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.440
TO HELP ME AND MINE,
YOU'VE SHOWN ME THAT LIGHT.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.109
I SEE IT NOW, TOO.
HUH?

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.415
HA HA HA!

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:38.692
HERE WE GO.
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:40.727
[THINKING] I'VE GOT
4 SPEED COUNTERS.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:43.196
SAFETY'S OFF NOW,
AND NOT ONLY THAT.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.565
HE'S GOT GATLING OGRE
ON HIS FIELD.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.468
IF HE'S DRAWN EITHER
A TRAP OR A SPEED SPELL,

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:51.104
I'M DONE FOR.

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:53.873
HA HA HA!

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.176
WHAT DOES HE HAVE?

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:58.278
YOU SURE LUCKED OUT
THIS TIME,

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:00.080
BUT NOW I CAN RELEASE
MY GATLING OGRE

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.882
AND SUMMON BIG CANNON OGRE
IN ITS PLACE.

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.452
WHAT? YOU'RE DITCHING
GATLING OGRE?

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:06.920
SO YOU HAD
A BACK-UP PLAN?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.389
THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS STORY'S GOT
MULTIPLE ENDINGS,

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.959
BUT I'M AFRAID
EACH N' EVERY ONE OF
'EM'S BAD FOR YOU.

00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:16.162
[ROARS]

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.002
Computer: BIG CANNON OGRE
IS A LEVEL 7 FIEND TYPE MONSTER

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:25.538
WITH 2400 ATTACK POINTS
AND 2400 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:27.774
SO WHAT'S THIS
BIG GUY ALL ABOUT?

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:30.110
THIS HERE IS
BIG CANNON OGRE, MY FRIEND,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.645
AND HE'S ALL ABOUT BEING
TWO TONS OF GUTS N' GLORY

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:33.980
AND BRINGING
A RELENTLESS BARRAGE

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.583
OF DESTRUCTION AND MAYHEM
EVERYWHERE HE GOES.

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.318
SOUNDS IMPRESSIVE
ON PAPER,

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:41.955
BUT HE STILL DOESN'T
HAVE MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN MY TURRET WARRIOR.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.923
THAT DOESN'T MATTER
IN THIS CASE.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:47.394
DO IT, BIG CANNON OGRE.
ATTACK THAT TURRET WARRIOR.

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:50.030
MY WARRIOR.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.399
I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF SKILL SUCCESSOR

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.467
FROM WITHIN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.736
WHEN I REMOVE THIS CARD
ENTIRELY FROM PLAY,

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.172
I CAN INCREASE THE ATTACK
POINTS OF ONE MONSTER

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:02.675
ON MY FIELD BY 800
UNTIL THE END PHASE.

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.079
NOW BIG CANNON OGRE'S
BALLISTIC BARRAGE

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:08.782
CAN SHATTER
YOUR MONSTER'S DEFENSES.

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:11.184
GO, BIG CANNON FIRE!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.493
HRRGH!

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.763
WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT GIVES?

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:26.499
THANKS TO BIG CANNON OGRE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.334
THE BATTLE DAMAGE
YOU TAKE IS DOUBLED.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.437
THAT'S WHAT GIVES.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:34.607
NOW THAT WE'RE
IN THE END PHASE,

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:38.411
BIG CANNON OGRE'S ATTACK POINTS
RETURN BACK TO NORMAL.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.680
LOOKS LIKE
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.248
[THINKING]
I MANAGED TO HANG ON,

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.716
BUT IF I DON'T
TURN THIS THING AROUND,

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:46.086
THEN I'M NEVER GETTING
OUT OF THIS MINE.

00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:50.557
UGH.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:54.627
[THINKING]
I CAN DO THIS.

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.996
I JUST HAVE TO SPEED
THINGS UP A LITTLE.

00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:22.088
Guard: FASTER!
HUH?

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:24.691
MAN, THESE GUYS DON'T
KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.026
HUH? HUH?

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.196
I WORKED HERE.

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:33.299
IF WE BREAK RIGHT
AT THE FORK UP AHEAD,
WE CAN GET TO THE OUTSIDE.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.302
ARE YOU SURE? HUH?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.172
[THINKING]
IF WE CAN ELUDE
THOSE GUARDS UNTIL THEN.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:40.540
THEY GOTTA BE
KIDDIN' US.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.809
SURELY THEY DON'T
