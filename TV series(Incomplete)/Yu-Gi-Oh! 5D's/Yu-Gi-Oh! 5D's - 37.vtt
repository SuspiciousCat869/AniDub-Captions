00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:49.753
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T LIKE
TO LEAVE YOUR HOUSE.

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:51.254
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:52.656
WITHOUT THE MOVEMENT,

00:08:52.656 --> 00:08:55.358
YOU'LL GO THROUGH
THE SAME DRAMA THAT
I WENT THROUGH.

00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:57.094
AND TRUST ME,
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

00:08:57.094 --> 00:08:59.496
AKIZA!

00:09:05.502 --> 00:09:07.404
I THOUGHT
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:09.106
THE MEETING'S
ABOUT TO START.

00:09:09.106 --> 00:09:12.209
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO WITH LEO,
SAYER?

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:15.445
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY POWERS,
BUT WE CAN STILL USE HIM.

00:09:15.445 --> 00:09:17.748
IF WE CAN CONVINCE HIM
TO JOIN THE MOVEMENT,

00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:20.283
LUNA WON'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

00:09:20.283 --> 00:09:21.384
THE KID'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

00:09:21.384 --> 00:09:22.886
DON'T HURT HIM ANYMORE.

00:09:22.886 --> 00:09:26.890
DON'T WORRY, 'KIZA.
I AM NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.297
[THINKING]
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON,
IF... IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

00:09:34.297 --> 00:09:37.367
PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

00:09:39.703 --> 00:09:43.707
PLEASE HELP ME.
HELP ME, ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON.

00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:46.977
LUNA.

00:09:46.977 --> 00:09:48.278
[GASP]

00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:51.648
LUNA, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T HELP YOU
RIGHT NOW.

00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:53.483
I AM STILL BOUND
TO THIS DIMENSION

00:09:53.483 --> 00:09:56.119
BY FORCES DARK
AND SINISTER.

00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:57.988
BUT THERE MIGHT BE
A WAY.

00:09:57.988 --> 00:09:59.656
RIGHT NOW,
MY SERVANT REGULUS

00:09:59.656 --> 00:10:02.058
STRUGGLES DEEP
IN THE SHADOWS.

00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:05.462
IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
AND FREE HIM FROM HIS CURSE,

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:08.064
PERHAPS THE TWO OF YOU
CAN COMBINE YOUR POWERS

00:10:08.064 --> 00:10:10.934
AND BREAK THE SEAL
BINDING ME TO THIS ROCK.

00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:13.136
YOU MUST FIND
REGULUS, LUNA.

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:16.640
WITHOUT HIM,
I WILL BE TRAPPED HERE
FOREVER.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.009
WHO IS REGULUS?
IS HE A PERSON?

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:21.011
WHERE IS HE?
HOW DO I FIND HIM?

00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:23.013
HELLO?

00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:27.717
Carly: COULD YOU TELL ME
WHICH APARTMENT IS MISTY'S?

00:10:27.717 --> 00:10:28.952
Woman: LAST NAME, PLEASE?

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:30.587
I THINK IT'S TREDWELL.

00:10:30.587 --> 00:10:33.723
OH, SO YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE WORLD-FAMOUS SUPERMODEL
MISTY TREDWELL,

00:10:33.723 --> 00:10:35.158
WHO TREASURES HER PRIVACY

00:10:35.158 --> 00:10:36.459
AND DOESN'T WANNA
BE BOTHERED AT HER HOME

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:37.894
BY EVERY KOOK
OFF THE STREET.

00:10:37.894 --> 00:10:39.830
LOOK, I KNOW HER.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.833
REALLY? THAT'S WEIRD,
'CAUSE I KNOW WHERE
MY FRIENDS LIVE.

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:44.334
HEY, I KNOW.

00:10:44.334 --> 00:10:46.236
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
YOU HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
FOR HER,

00:10:46.236 --> 00:10:47.571
SEE IF THAT WORKS?

00:10:47.571 --> 00:10:50.907
WE ARE FRIENDS! WE...
WE MET AT A PARTY, ONCE.

00:10:50.907 --> 00:10:53.143
OH, YOU MET
AT A PARTY, ONCE!

00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:54.778
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:57.314
Misty: IT'S FINE, KATE.

00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:58.415
MISTY!

00:10:58.415 --> 00:10:59.749
IS EVERYTHING OK
WITH YOU?

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:03.019
YOU HAVE A VISITOR.
SHE SEEMS OFF TO ME.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:04.421
REMEMBER ME, MISTY?

00:11:04.421 --> 00:11:05.789
I WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING,

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:08.191
BUT... BUT YOUR GUARD
DOG WOULDN'T LET ME IN.

00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:09.759
SORRY, CARLY.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:12.429
KATE TAKES HER JOB
VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:14.898
COME ON,
LET'S GO SOMEWHERE A
LITTLE MORE PRIVATE

00:11:14.898 --> 00:11:16.032
SO WE CAN TALK.

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:17.033
[GIGGLE]

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.468
[SCOFF]

00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:22.505
OHH.

00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:24.875
DON'T JUST STAND THERE,
COME ON IN.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.277
R-RIGHT.

00:11:27.277 --> 00:11:30.013
I'LL GET US SOME TEA.
SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

00:11:30.013 --> 00:11:32.916
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM A SHOOT OVERSEAS.

00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:34.751
THIS PLACE
IS AMAZING.

00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:36.286
IT'S NOT BAD, I GUESS.

00:11:36.286 --> 00:11:38.388
IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
SOMETIMES.

00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:40.724
YOU CAN SURROUND YOURSELF
WITH ALL SORTS OF THINGS,

00:11:40.724 --> 00:11:43.260
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE
YOU LOVE,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.527
IT ALL FEELS EMPTY.

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:45.662
DO YA' KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:11:45.662 --> 00:11:47.664
GOSH, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU MEAN!

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:50.133
SPOKEN LIKE A GIRL
IN LOVE.

00:11:50.133 --> 00:11:51.768
I'M NOT IN LOVE.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

00:11:51.768 --> 00:11:53.770
YOUR FACE TELLS ME
EVERYTHING.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.273
EH?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:11:56.273 --> 00:11:57.440
YOU DO
FORTUNE TELLING

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.175
BY READING PEOPLE'S
FACES AND STUFF, RIGHT?

00:11:59.175 --> 00:12:00.143
[CHUCKLE]

00:12:00.143 --> 00:12:01.311
BUT THE WAY YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW,

00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:03.580
ANYONE COULD
READ YOUR FACE.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.882
THE WAY I AM?
WHADDYA MEAN,
HOW AM I?

00:12:05.882 --> 00:12:08.151
HERE, RELAX.

00:12:08.151 --> 00:12:09.552
THANKS, MISTY.

00:12:09.552 --> 00:12:13.356
SO WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DID YOU WANNA
ASK ME?

00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:15.125
THIS MIGHT SEEM
KINDA WEIRD,

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.326
BUT I'M A JOURNALIST,

00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:18.461
AND I'M INVESTIGATING
THAT CRIMSON DRAGON
THING

00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.230
THAT APPEARED DURING
THE FORTUNE CUP,

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.634
AND, WELL, THAT LED ME
TO INVESTIGATE THAT
DUELIST NAMED AKIZA,

00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:25.802
AND SO, UM...

00:12:25.802 --> 00:12:28.638
THAT LED YOU TO INVESTIGATE
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:33.343
YEAH, AND I FOUND OUT
THAT YOU HAD SOME
CONNECTION TO THEM.

00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:34.978
I NEVER GOT INVOLVED
WITH THEM,

00:12:34.978 --> 00:12:38.548
BUT THEY MANAGED
TO SINK THEIR CLAWS
INTO MY YOUNGER BROTHER,

00:12:38.548 --> 00:12:40.450
AND THEY TOOK HIM FROM ME.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.885
[GASP]

00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:00.292
[THINKING]
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M DOING THIS,

00:13:00.292 --> 00:13:03.128
BUT I HAVE TO SEE IF MISTY'S
STORY IS TRUE.

00:13:03.128 --> 00:13:04.563
THE LAST TIME
I SAW MY BROTHER,

00:13:04.563 --> 00:13:08.167
HE HAD JUST COME BACK
FROM WATCHING A DUEL
IN THE NARROWS.

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:09.501
HE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:11.870
HE WAS GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT "THE MOVEMENT."

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.338
I ASKED HIM WHAT HE MEANT,

00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:15.073
AND SUDDENLY WE WERE
FIGHTING,

00:13:15.073 --> 00:13:18.076
AND THEN HE STORMED OFF,
AND I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

00:13:18.076 --> 00:13:19.978
DID YOU REPORT
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT

00:13:19.978 --> 00:13:21.079
AND HAVE THEM
INVESTIGATED?

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:23.482
THE AUTHORITIES
ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS,

00:13:23.482 --> 00:13:25.150
BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.752
AND THAT WAS THAT.

00:13:26.752 --> 00:13:27.953
THAT'S WEIRD.

00:13:27.953 --> 00:13:28.921
YOU WOULD THINK
THEY'D STEP UP

00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:30.489
AND CONDUCT A FULL-ON
INVESTIGATION

00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:32.558
IN THE CASE OF
A MISSING PERSON.

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.126
SOMEONE IN
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT

00:13:34.126 --> 00:13:37.496
MUST HAVE SOME SERIOUS DIRT
ON ONE OF THE HIGHER-UPS
RUNNING THE CITY.

00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:39.598
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SECRET COVER-UP?

00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:41.600
THINK IT'S GOT
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH GOODWIN?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.835
I DON'T KNOW,

00:13:42.835 --> 00:13:45.070
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.006
HMM.
WHAT KIND OF SECRET
COULD GOODWIN BE HIDING?

00:13:48.006 --> 00:13:49.308
ARCADIA.
HUH?

00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:51.677
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT,

00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:53.779
BUT I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:55.480
NO MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.050
DON'T BELIEVE THEM,
THEY'RE LYING.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.785
[THINKING]
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE HERE,

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:01.620
BUT THIS IS THE ONLY LEAD
I'VE GOT.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.822
I'VE GOTTA FOLLOW IT
TO THE END.

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:06.158

THERE WAS A MEETING.

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:07.426

GONNA BE INVOLVED

00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:09.127
IN GROUP MEETINGS
ANYMORE, AKIZA.

00:14:09.127 --> 00:14:11.430
WE'VE GOT MUCH BIGGER
PLANS FOR YOU.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.631
IT'S TIME
FOR THE MOVEMENT

00:14:12.631 --> 00:14:14.466
TO SEEK MEMBERS
ACROSS THE GLOBE,

00:14:14.466 --> 00:14:17.636
AND WHO BEST TO HELP
THAN OUR OWN FORTUNE CUP
PARTICIPANT?

00:14:17.636 --> 00:14:21.406
I MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT STAR POWER
WRITTEN ALL OVER YOU, AKIZA.

00:14:21.406 --> 00:14:22.941
YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME
THE LIVING SYMBOL
OF THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:14:22.941 --> 00:14:28.380
YOU'RE GONNA TURN ME
INTO SOME KINDA
BILLBOARD?

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.250
DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT.
THIS IS A HUGE HONOR.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.185
YOU'RE GOING TO LEAD
A LOT OF LOST SOULS

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.621
TO THE ONE PLACE
THEY CAN TURN TO, AKIZA.

00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:37.923
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LOVE YOU.

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:41.460
WHERE AM I?

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.430
I FEEL LIKE I KEEP GOING DOWN
THE SAME HALLWAY OVER AND OVER.

THERE SHE IS!

00:14:52.271 --> 00:14:54.172
OH, MY. OH, NO.
I FORGOT TO SWEEP UP
BACK THERE.

00:14:54.172 --> 00:14:55.173

00:14:55.173 --> 00:14:56.241
UH, YES, SIR?

00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.743
HAVE I SEEN YOU
BEFORE?

00:14:57.743 --> 00:14:58.977
UH, YEAH.

I'M THE ONE
WHO FILLS IN
FOR THE FILL-INS

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:03.682

TO FILL IN FOR
THE SICK ONES.

00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:06.551
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, CARRY ON.

THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.559
THIS MUST BE SAYER'S OFFICE.

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:21.133
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
LANGUAGE THIS IS,

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:23.435
BUT MAYBE I CAN FIND A PICTURE
OF A SYMBOL

00:15:23.435 --> 00:15:25.904
THAT LOOKS LIKE
ONE OF THOSE MARKS.

00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:27.572

00:15:27.572 --> 00:15:29.808

00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:33.078

00:15:39.885 --> 00:15:42.854
I HAVE TO ADDRESS
A SMALL RODENT PROBLEM.

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:45.490
OK, WEIRD.

00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:47.059
AFTER HEARING MISTY'S STORY,

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:50.028
I MADE A LIST OF PEOPLE WHO'VE
GONE MISSING THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:15:50.028 --> 00:15:54.266
ALMOST EVERYONE ON MY LIST
IS MENTIONED IN THESE FILES.

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:56.935
WHAT IS THIS ARCADIA
MOVEMENT REALLY ABOUT?

00:15:56.935 --> 00:16:00.472
OH! HUH?

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:04.576

00:16:04.576 --> 00:16:07.279
"REX GOODWIN LIVES A LIFE
OF MANY LIES,

WELL, WELL,
A LITTLE MOUSE.
SAYER!

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:12.451
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL.

00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:15.821
YOU SHOULDN'T GO SCAMPERING
WHERE THERE COULD BE TRAPS.

00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:18.390

YOU MIGHT BE WORKING
FOR GOODWIN,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.258
BUT JUDGING FROM
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,

00:16:20.258 --> 00:16:22.728
I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE FLYING SOLO.

00:16:22.728 --> 00:16:24.096
DOESN'T MATTER, THOUGH,

00:16:24.096 --> 00:16:25.230
'CAUSE NOW THAT
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT YOU'VE SEEN,

OF GOOD SPORT,

00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:32.971

GIVE YOU A FIGHTING CHANCE.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:37.209
I'M WILLING TO GRANT YOU
A VERY SLIM HOPE.

00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:38.643
YOU WANNA DUEL?

00:16:38.643 --> 00:16:40.946
YOU CAN TRY TO RUN,
OR YOU CAN DUEL ME.

00:16:40.946 --> 00:16:42.581
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:45.550
OR SHOULD I JUST
LOCK YOU UP FOREVER NOW?

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.720
[THINKING]
I'M NOT AFRAID.
I CAN DO THIS.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.922
I LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT DUELING
WHEN I DUELED WITH JACK!

00:16:50.922 --> 00:16:53.558
AND, HEY, MAYBE
THIS COULD BE GOOD.

00:16:53.558 --> 00:16:55.994
I COULD STOP TRYING TO
BE A REPORTER

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:58.730
AND BECOME THE WORLD'S
FIRST FAMOUS DUELING
MARRIED COUPLE

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.265
WITH JACK!

00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:01.833
OH!

00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:07.973
BRING IT ON.

00:17:07.973 --> 00:17:09.941
YOU SHOULDA TRIED TO RUN.

00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:26.509
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:27.877
THE FIRST MOVE IS MINE!

00:17:27.877 --> 00:17:31.748
I SUMMON TELEKINETIC
SHOCKER IN ATTACK MODE!

00:17:33.616 --> 00:17:36.753
Computer: IF YOUR PSYCHIC TYPE
MONSTER IS ABOUT
TO BE DESTROYED,

00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:38.888
YOU CAN PAY 500 LIFE POINTS

00:17:38.888 --> 00:17:42.258
AND DESTROY TELEKINETIC SHOCKER
IN ITS PLACE.

00:17:42.258 --> 00:17:44.761
UNFORTUNATELY,
I CAN'T ATTACK YOU
WITH THIS MONSTER

00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:45.928
ON THE TURN IT'S SUMMONED,

00:17:45.928 --> 00:17:49.365
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE UP, LITTLE MOUSE.

00:17:49.365 --> 00:17:51.234
THIS IS PROB'LY
THE ONLY TURN YOU'LL HAVE,

00:17:51.234 --> 00:17:53.436
SO MAKE IT COUNT.

00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:56.205
OK, HERE GOES!

00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:57.540
EEH!

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.510
[THINKING]
"THE PERSON WHO DRAWS
THIS CARD IS DOOMED!"

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.045
I'M DOOMED?!

00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:04.747
MAKES SENSE,
'CAUSE HE'S A PSYCHIC
DUELIST, AND...

00:18:04.747 --> 00:18:07.850
AND THEY SAY THEY'RE
ABLE TO DEAL REAL
DAMAGE, SO IF...

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.952
NO! I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT MY FORTUNE NOW.

00:18:09.952 --> 00:18:12.021
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:15.825
I SUMMON FORTUNE FAIRY
SWEE IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:20.496
THEN, FROM MY HAND,

00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:23.966
I ACTIVATE THE
UNACCEPTABLE RESULT
SPELL CARD!

00:18:23.966 --> 00:18:25.601
NOW, WHEN I SUMMON
A FORTUNE FAIRY,

00:18:25.601 --> 00:18:26.769
I CAN USE THIS
SPELL CARD

00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:28.971
TO SUMMON ANOTHER ONE
TO THE FIELD!

00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:32.842
I GIVE YOU,
FORTUNE FAIRY CHEE!

00:18:32.842 --> 00:18:35.912
AND NEXT UP,
I'M ACTIVATING
ANOTHER SPELL CARD!

00:18:35.912 --> 00:18:37.213
I CAN USE THIS SPELL
TO SUMMON

00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:39.015
A FORTUNE FAIRY
FROM MY HAND

00:18:39.015 --> 00:18:40.249
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT
AS POWERFUL

00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:42.385
AS THE TWO OTHERS
ON MY FIELD.

00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:45.555
I SUMMON
FORTUNE FAIRY HU!

00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:48.458
NONE OF THEM
HAVE ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:48.458 --> 00:18:53.029
LOOKS LIKE MY LITTLE MOUSE
ISN'T GOING TO BE AROUND
TO BOTHER ME MUCH LONGER.

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:55.531
AND HERE I WAS HOPING
FOR A REAL CHALLENGE.

00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:56.766
OH, REALLY?

00:18:56.766 --> 00:18:59.235
I'M NOT AS WEAK
AS YOU THINK I AM,
SAYER!

00:18:59.235 --> 00:19:01.637
'CAUSE I'VE GOT THIS!
MIRACLE STONE!

00:19:01.637 --> 00:19:04.073
FOR EVERY FORTUNE FAIRY
ON THE FIELD,

00:19:04.073 --> 00:19:07.343
EACH ONE OF THEM GAINS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:07.343 --> 00:19:10.079
SO WE'RE TALKING
3,000 EACH!

00:19:12.882 --> 00:19:14.317
LUCKY FOR YOU,

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:16.018
THEY CAN'T ATTACK
ON THE TURN
THEY WERE SUMMONED.

00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:17.587
SO I END MY TURN.

00:19:17.587 --> 00:19:20.156
THE LITTLE MOUSE
HAS SOME SURPRISES.

00:19:20.156 --> 00:19:22.325
BUT I HAVE SOME, TOO.

00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:23.292
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:26.929
FROM MY HAND,
I SUMMON PSYCHIC SNAIL!

00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:31.300
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
MY EMERGENCY TELEPORT SPELL,

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.004
WHICH LETS ME SUMMON
ANOTHER PSYCHIC MONSTER
FROM MY HAND OR DECK.

00:19:35.004 --> 00:19:39.775
AND THE MONSTER
I'M SUMMONING
IS PSYCHIC COMMANDER!

00:19:39.775 --> 00:19:41.711
[ROAR]

00:19:41.711 --> 00:19:44.046
[THINKING]
HE'S GOT 3 MONSTERS
ON HIS FIELD,

00:19:44.046 --> 00:19:45.515
BUT NONE OF THEM
ARE STRONG ENOUGH

00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:47.583
TO TAKE ON MY
FORTUNE FAIRIES.

00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:50.086
YOU THINK YOU'VE
BUILT YOURSELF
A SOLID DEFENSE,

00:19:50.086 --> 00:19:51.854
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:19:51.854 --> 00:19:56.526
FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
PSYCHOKINESIS!

00:19:56.526 --> 00:19:58.995
BY SACRIFICING
1,000 LIFE POINTS

00:19:58.995 --> 00:20:00.229
TO THE POWER
OF TELOKENESIS,

00:20:00.229 --> 00:20:02.732
I CAN DESTROY
ONE OF YOUR CARDS.

00:20:02.732 --> 00:20:05.201
NOW, I WONDER WHICH CARD
I SHOULD DISPATCH OF?

00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:07.603
HOW ABOUT MIRACLE STONE?

00:20:07.603 --> 00:20:10.406
SINCE YOUR ENTIRE DEFENSE
DEPENDS ON THAT CARD.

00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:13.376
AAH!

00:20:13.376 --> 00:20:14.777
WITH THAT CARD GONE,

00:20:14.777 --> 00:20:17.780
YOUR LITTLE FORTUNE FAIRIES
LOSE ALL THEIR ATTACK POINTS.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.148
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:20:19.148 --> 00:20:22.885
AND NOW,
TELEKINETIC SHOCKER ATTACKS!

00:20:24.687 --> 00:20:26.255
[SCREAMING]

00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:30.092
THAT HURT?

00:20:30.092 --> 00:20:31.794
WHAT WAS THAT SHOCK?

00:20:31.794 --> 00:20:34.363
THAT WAS THE POWER
OF THE PSYCHIC DUEL.

00:20:34.363 --> 00:20:36.365
AND SO IS THIS!

00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:39.635
GO, PSYCHIC SNAIL!

00:20:39.635 --> 00:20:41.804
[YELLING]

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.008
YOU WON'T GET AWAY
WITH THIS.

00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:48.878
SECTOR SECURITY
WILL COME LOOKING
FOR CARLY CARMINE.

00:20:48.878 --> 00:20:50.079
OF COURSE THEY WILL,

00:20:50.079 --> 00:20:52.348
AND YOU'LL BECOME
ANOTHER MISSING PERSON,

00:20:52.348 --> 00:20:54.116
ONE MORE COLD CASE.

00:20:54.116 --> 00:20:56.786
SECTOR SECURITY
CAN'T TOUCH US,

00:20:56.786 --> 00:20:59.822
NOT AS LONG AS I KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT GOODWIN.

00:20:59.822 --> 00:21:01.457
AND WHAT TRUTH
WOULD THAT BE?

00:21:01.457 --> 00:21:03.826
EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN
JUST LOVES GOODWIN.

00:21:03.826 --> 00:21:06.095
HE'S AN HONEST LEADER,
A MODEL CITIZEN,

00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:09.031
NEW DOMINO CITY'S
FAVORITE SON.

00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:10.433
BUT HE HAS A SECRET.

00:21:10.433 --> 00:21:13.569
DIRECTOR GOODWIN IS
FROM THE SATELLITE SECTOR.

00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:17.240
AND THAT, MY DEAR,
IS THE LEAST OF HIS SECRETS.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.675
I WONDER
WHAT ELSE HE'S HIDING?

00:21:19.675 --> 00:21:21.310
NIGHT-NIGHT, LITTLE MOUSE.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.614
GO, PSYCHIC COMMANDER!

00:21:24.614 --> 00:21:25.615
AAH!

00:21:25.615 --> 00:21:27.049
OHH!

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:28.751
[YELLING]

00:21:33.489 --> 00:21:34.690
YOUR EYES...

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.592
THEY'RE SHOWING ME
THE PATH YOU WILL TAKE.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:39.996
IT IS A PATH THAT
WILL DISAPPEAR
INTO A DARKNESS, CARLY.

00:21:39.996 --> 00:21:42.365
BUT WHEN YOU CHOOSE
TO TAKE THIS PATH,

00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:46.602
YOU WILL KNOW YOURSELF BETTER
THAN YOU EVER HAVE BEFORE.

00:21:48.371 --> 00:21:52.642
MISTY, HELP ME!
