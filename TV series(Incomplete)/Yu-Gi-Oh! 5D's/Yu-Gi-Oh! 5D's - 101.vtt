WEBVTT

00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:02.738
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:05.076
MC: TEAM 5D's,
WHO STARTED THIS TOURNAMENT

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:09.350
AS ONE OF ITS TOP CONTENDERS,
IS NOW TEETERING ON THE EDGE
OF ELIMINATION!

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:13.322
EVEN THOUGH YUSEI HAS INHERITED
SPEED COUNTERS AND CARDS
FROM HIS TEAMMATE, AKIZA,

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.494
HE'S STILL JUST ONE DUELIST
WHO WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT THREE

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.199
IN ORDER TO WRANGLE THE WIN
AWAY FROM TEAM UNICORN!

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:21.737
SEE, YUSEI,
IN A TAG TEAM DUEL,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:23.506
WHEN YOU'RE UP THREE
TO ONE, WELL, THEN--

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:25.178
WELL, THEN WHAT?

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.046
THEN YOU CAN AFFORD
A FEW CASUALTIES.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:29.249
AFTER ALL, BETWEEN
THE THREE OF US,

00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:32.389
WE HAVE LIFE POINTS TO SPARE,
WHILE YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.325
HAVE ONLY A PRECIOUS FEW!

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:36.796
I ACTIVATE MAGIC CHARGE!
THANKS TO THIS TRAP,

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:40.335
IF A SPELL CARD ON MY FIELD
IS DESTROYED DUE TO ONE
OF YOUR CARD'S EFFECTS,

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:44.008
THEN WE'RE BOTH DEALT
2000 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:48.883
TALK ABOUT TAKING ONE
FOR THE TEAM!

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:53.925
ALL RIGHT, BREO,
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE UP NOW.
RIGHT!

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.471
[GROANING]
YUSEI!

00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:03.541
EASY, JACK.
JUST REST.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.848
YUSEI HAS IT ALL
UNDER CONTROL, I HOPE.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.888
NOW BY REMOVING TEN SPEED
COUNTERS, I CAN DESTROY
ONE CARD ON THE FIELD,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.427
AND THE CARD I CHOOSE
TO DESTROY IS ONE OF MY OWN!

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.999
VOLTIC BICORN!
WHAT?!

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.370
WHEN VOLTIC BICORN
IS DESTROYED,

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.675
WE EACH MUST THEN TAKE
HOWEVER MANY CARDS
ARE EQUAL TO HIS LEVEL

00:01:24.677 --> 00:01:26.313
AND THEN BANISH THOSE CARDS
STRAIGHT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:28.784
SO YOU LOSE SEVEN CARDS
FROM YOUR DECK!

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.589
UH-OH.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:33.492
[THINKING]
SORRY, YUSEI,

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.663
BUT YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE
OUT OF DUEL AMMO!

00:01:36.664 --> 00:01:41.004

MC: WELL, DUEL FANS,

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:49.254
YUSEI FUDO OF THE TEAM 5D's
HAS PUT UP AN IMPRESSIVE STAND

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:51.557
AGAINST THE CRAFTY COMBATANTS
OF TEAM UNICORN.

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.961
BUT THE QUESTION IS,
CAN HE KEEP IT UP?

00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:58.636
HE'S AWFULLY OUTNUMBERED AND
BEING METHODICALLY DRAINED
OF HIS DUEL CARDS.

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.509
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME,
YUSEI. DEFEAT IS COMING!

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:06.650
BUT UNTIL THEN,
I'LL END WITH THESE.

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.454
TEAM UNICORN'S PLAN
IS SO LAME!

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:12.960
YEAH, TOTALLY.
WHITTLING DOWN YUSEI'S DECK
UNTIL HE'S OUT OF CARDS?

00:03:13.962 --> 00:03:15.932
AGREED, BUT IF IT WORKS,
WE'RE THROUGH.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:18.903
YUSEI'LL HANG ON
THROUGH BREO. I KNOW IT!

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:22.410
YEAH, BUT THEN HE'S
GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
DUELING WITH JEAN.

00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:25.582
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING GOOD.

00:03:26.584 --> 00:03:28.954
YUSEI, STAY STRONG.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:35.665
JACK'S COMING TO!

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.004
[GRUNTS]
EASY, YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:41.175
THE DUEL.
DID WE END UP WINNING?

00:03:42.177 --> 00:03:44.247
IT'S NOT OVER YET.
YUSEI'S DUELING BREO
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.418
WHAT ABOUT AKIZA?
SHE WAS TAKEN DOWN
BY ANDRE.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.590
I SEE. SO, THEN...

00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:54.130
SO THEN UNLESS YUSEI BEATS
BOTH BREO AND JEAN,

00:03:55.132 --> 00:03:57.435
TEAM 5D's WILL BE OUT.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:03:59.573
IT'S STILL POSSIBLE.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.210
WE'LL SEE.

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.217
BREO'S PLAN IS
TO CHIP AWAY AT MY DECK,

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.855
AND I ONLY HAVE
23 CARDS LEFT,

00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:11.293
SO TIME IS OF
THE ESSENCE!

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:14.898
IT'S MY TURN!

00:04:17.136 --> 00:04:17.702
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT!

00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.109
I PLAY
THE SPEED SPELL
ACCELERATE DRAW!

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.615
NOW, SINCE I HAVE
12 SPEED COUNTERS
AND YOU DON'T,

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:26.651
I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.087
[ALL GASP]

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.589
WAS THAT
A GOOD IDEA?

00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:32.529
YEAH, SHOULDN'T YUSEI
BE CONSERVING HIS CARDS
AT THIS POINT?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.498
WELL, THAT'D BE
ONE STRATEGY--

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.971
TO PLAY IT SAFE
AND SLOWLY SHAVE DOWN
BREO'S LIFE POINTS.

00:04:38.973 --> 00:04:42.178
THEN AGAIN, ANOTHER WAY
TO GO WOULD BE TO CHARGE
RIGHT AT BREO

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.751
AND TAKE HIM DOWN BEFORE
HE CAN TAKE DOWN ANY
MORE OF YUSEI'S CARDS.

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:47.520
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
YUSEI'S SETTLED ON.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:49.490
GET READY
FOR SOME FIREWORKS.

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:52.328
STARDUST DRAGON,
ATTACK BREO DIRECTLY!

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.668
[DRAGON ROARING]

00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:01.911
NICE, BUT NOW
IT'S MY TURN!

00:05:02.913 --> 00:05:04.483
AND I PLAY
REGRETFUL TUNING!

00:05:05.484 --> 00:05:06.486
THANKS TO
THIS TRAP CARD,

00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:08.456
SINCE I RECEIVED
A DIRECT ATTACK,

00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:11.328
I CAN NOW SUMMON
A SYNCHRO MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVE!

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:14.700
WELCOME BACK,
VOLTIC BICORN!

00:05:15.702 --> 00:05:17.405
AND SINCE A MONSTER'S
BEEN SUMMONED USING
THIS EFFECT,

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:20.576
IF IT ATTACKS, IT'S THEN
DESTROYED AT THE END
OF THE BATTLE!

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:24.115
THIS IS BAD.
IF VOLTIC BICORN
IS BACK, THEN--

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.588
THEN HIS ABILITY IS
BACK, TOO, AN ABILITY
THAT ACTIVATES WHEN HE'S

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.294
DESTROYED AND WILL FORCE
YUSEI TO SEND SEVEN
CARDS TO HIS GRAVE!

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:35.368
[THINKING] STARDUST DRAGON
AND VOLTIC BICORN HAVE THE
SAME NUMBER OF ATTACK POINTS.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.305
IF HE ATTACKS,
THEY'LL BOTH BE DESTROYED,

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:41.311
WHICH MEANS I'LL LOSE
MY BEST MONSTER AND
SEVEN CARDS ALL AT ONCE.

00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:45.251
BREO'S DOING QUITE WELL.
YOU MAY NOT EVEN NEED
TO SUIT UP, JEAN.

00:05:46.253 --> 00:05:47.789
YOU COULD BE RIGHT, ANDRE.

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:50.327
I MEAN, JUST LOOK
AT YUSEI'S FACE.

00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:52.430
HE'S COMPLETELY PERPLEXED.

00:05:53.432 --> 00:05:55.068
AH! I END MY TURN

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.704
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:01.913
IS THAT ALL? FINE, THEN.
MY DRAW!

00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:03.538
FIRST THINGS FIRST!

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:07.055
VOLTIC BICORN,
ATTACK THAT STARDUST!

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.493
NO. HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA COME FIRST--

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.199
MY TRAP--SYNCHRO
STRIKER UNIT!

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.205
AND THEN, WHEN I EQUIP
SYNCHRO STRIKER TO
A SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:21.179
THAT SYNCHRO MONSTER
GAINS 1000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:28.191
IN THAT CASE, I PLAY
THE TRAP CARD FLATTERY!

00:06:29.193 --> 00:06:32.198
WITH THIS, IF YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS
CHANGE DURING BATTLE,

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.203
THAT AMOUNT IS THEN
ADDED TO MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.139
UNTIL THE END
OF THAT BATTLE.

00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.746
[WHINNIES]

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:43.246
NO!

00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:44.618
YES, YUSEI!

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.018
AW, MAN!

00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:47.557
SO STARDUST
DRAGON'S GONE?

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.061
I'M AFRAID SO.
HE POWERED UP,

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:52.999
BUT THEN BICORN
POWERED UP, TOO.

00:06:54.001 --> 00:06:56.472
AND NOW FOR
THE BEST PART, YUSEI.

00:06:57.473 --> 00:06:58.475
SINCE BICORN WAS
DESTROYED,

00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:02.849
WE BOTH SEND
SEVEN CARDS IN OUR
DECKS TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:04.852
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET!

00:07:05.854 --> 00:07:07.925
NOW I'M ACTIVATING
THE TRAP CARD
TUNING COLLAPSE!

00:07:08.926 --> 00:07:09.595
WHAT?

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.300
NOW YOU MUST SEND THE
SAME NUMBER OF CARDS IN
YOUR DECK TO THE GRAVE

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:17.307
AS WHATEVER YOUR
DESTROYED SYNCHRO MONSTER'S
LEVEL HAPPENED TO BE!

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:22.183
OH, NO! SO SINCE STARDUST
DRAGON'S LEVEL WAS 8,
THAT MEANS EIGHT CARDS?

00:07:23.184 --> 00:07:26.389
AND IF YOU ADD THAT TO
THE SEVEN HE'S ALREADY
LOST, THAT MAKES 15!

00:07:27.391 --> 00:07:29.060
NO! THAT'S TOO MANY!

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:32.200
OOH, THAT'S GOT TO HURT!

00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:33.702
IT'S HARD TO PLAY
YOUR CARDS RIGHT

00:07:34.703 --> 00:07:35.705
WHEN YOU'VE GOT
NO CARDS TO PLAY!

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:37.675
AND AT THE RATE
YUSEI'S DECK IS DIMINISHING,

00:07:38.677 --> 00:07:40.213
HE MAY WELL BE
IN THAT BOAT BEFORE LONG!

00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:42.517
IT'S NOW OR NEVER
FOR YUSEI,

00:07:43.518 --> 00:07:46.724
AND HE'S NEVER BEEN IN
A WORSE SPOT!

00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:04.321
[THINKING]
NOT ONLY DID I LOSE STARDUST
DRAGON IN THAT LAST ROUND,

00:08:05.323 --> 00:08:07.392
BUT I ALSO LOST 15 CARDS
FROM MY DECK.

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:10.230
I'VE ONLY GOT FIVE LEFT.

00:08:13.002 --> 00:08:13.469
LEO, THIS IS AWFUL.

00:08:14.471 --> 00:08:17.176
HOW CAN YUSEI MAKE
A COMEBACK WITHOUT ANY
CARDS TO COME BACK WITH?

00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:21.416
MAN! TEAM UNICORN
HAS REALLY DONE
A NUMBER ON US!

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.054
I KNOW, BUT AS LONG
AS THE NUMBER OF CARDS

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:26.892
IN YUSEI'S DECK ISN'T ZERO,
HE'S STILL IN THIS!

00:08:27.893 --> 00:08:29.931
JUST LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S STILL HOPING.

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:32.602
HOPE DOESN'T WIN
DUELS. WHAT DOES

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:36.141
IS A TEAM THAT'S
AS PERFECTLY BALANCED
AS WE ARE.

00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:38.144
WE'RE REALLY QUITE
THE THREESOME.

00:08:39.146 --> 00:08:42.686
IT'S TRUE. YOU SEE,
WHILE I PRIDE MYSELF ON
MY STRATEGIC INSTINCTS,

00:08:43.687 --> 00:08:46.191
BREO IS A GENIUS AT
ANALYZING AN OPPONENT'S
DUEL TACTICS.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.929
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE'S YOU,
OLD FRIEND.

00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:50.399
WHO, ME? YEAH, I ADMIT,

00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:53.504
IT TAKES A MASTER PLANNER
TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER,

00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:54.839
AND THAT PLANNER'S ME.

00:08:55.841 --> 00:08:57.844
THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT THAT, JEAN.
YOU'RE GOOD.

00:08:58.846 --> 00:08:59.280
HEH HEH!

00:09:00.282 --> 00:09:02.887
WHY, I BET
I HAVE MORE SKILLS
IN THIS FINGER,

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:04.890
AND MORE SMARTS
IN THIS ONE--

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:06.826
THAN ALL OF TEAM 5D's
PUT TOGETHER,

00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:08.863
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
GOING TO SAY?

00:09:09.864 --> 00:09:10.933
YOU READ MY MIND!

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:13.838
THAT'S TEAMWORK!
Breo: HEY!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.676
I WANT IN ON
THIS BACKSLAP SOIREE!

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:19.281
I KNOW I MAY BE
THE NEW GUY IN THE GROUP

00:09:20.283 --> 00:09:22.219
BUT EVER SINCE
THAT DAY YOU TOOK ME
UNDER YOUR WING,

00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:25.357
I'VE BECOME TWICE
THE DUELIST I EVER WAS!

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:27.829
Jean: WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A THIRD DUELIST
TO JOIN OUR TEAM,

00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:31.267
AND YOU HAVE SOME SKILLS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY? INTERESTED?

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:34.774
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
TEAM UNICORN IS
TEEMING WITH TALENT,

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.545
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE ON THAT TALENT,
GO RIGHT AHEAD!

00:09:38.546 --> 00:09:41.084
I PLAY THREE FACEDOWN
CARDS AND END MY TURN!

00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:43.555
MY DRAW!

00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:46.560
[THINKING]
WITH JUST FOUR CARDS LEFT
IN MY DECK, I'LL HAVE TO BE--

00:09:47.562 --> 00:09:48.530
I'M ACTIVATING
A TRAP CARD!

00:09:49.532 --> 00:09:50.434
TRICOLOR ILLUSION!

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:54.808
AND AS LONG AS TRICOLOR
IS ON THE FIELD,
YOU CAN'T ATTACK.

00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:58.247
BUT THERE'S MORE:
ONCE A TURN, DUE TO
THIS CARD'S EFFECT,

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:01.753
YOU HAVE TO DRAW A CARD;
THEN, DEPENDING ON
WHAT CARD YOU DRAW,

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:04.223
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW
CERTAIN INSTRUCTIONS:

00:10:05.225 --> 00:10:07.228
SHOULD YOU DRAW
A SPELL CARD, YOU ADD
THAT CARD TO YOUR HAND.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.432
DRAW A TRAP, AND YOU
MUST SEND THAT CARD

00:10:10.434 --> 00:10:11.870
AND ANOTHER IN
YOUR HAND TO THE GRAVE.

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:14.909
IF YOU DRAW A MONSTER,
YOU ADD THAT CARD
TO YOUR HAND,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.212
BUT THEN TAKE ANOTHER
CARD FROM YOUR HAND

00:10:18.214 --> 00:10:18.814
AND PLACE IT
ON TOP OF YOUR DECK.

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:21.152
RRR!
OR, IF YOU LIKE,

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.456
YOU CAN JUST
DESTROY TRICOLOR NOW

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.295
BY SENDING A CARD
IN YOUR DECK TO
THE GRAVEYARD.

00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:28.998
SO, YUSEI?
WHAT'LL IT BE?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.071
[THINKING]
I LOVE WATCHING
YUSEI SQUIRM.

00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:34.474
HE DOESN'T WANT TO
SEND A CARD IN HIS
HAND TO THE GRAVE

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:36.612
BUT HE ALSO
DOESN'T WANT
TO TAKE ANY GAMBLES,

00:10:37.613 --> 00:10:39.049
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE HAS SO LITTLE
TO GAMBLE WITH.

00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:43.657
THERE'S NO DOUBT.
HE'LL PLAY IT SAFE
AND DESTROY TRICOLOR.

00:10:45.126 --> 00:10:47.163
AH, BREO HAS HIM RIGHT
WHERE WE WANT HIM.

00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:49.334
YEP.

00:10:50.602 --> 00:10:53.106
[THINKING]
OF COURSE, IF YUSEI
USES SPEED WORLD 2,

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:55.844
HE CAN DESTROY TRICOLOR
ILLUSION OUTRIGHT,

00:10:56.846 --> 00:10:57.815
BUT I'M READY
FOR THAT, TOO.

00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:00.853
READY WITH THE TRAP
DESTRUCTION TRIGGER!

00:11:01.854 --> 00:11:03.490
I CAN ACTIVATE IT
WHEN A CARD I CONTROL
IS DESTROYED

00:11:04.492 --> 00:11:05.828
BY THE EFFECT OF
A SPELL OR A TRAP,

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.699
AND WHEN I DO
ACTIVATE IT, FIVE CARDS
FROM YUSEI'S DECK

00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:13.007
WILL BE BANISHED TO
THE GRAVE, AND THEN...

00:11:15.244 --> 00:11:16.780
MAKE UP YOUR MIND,
YUSEI, BUT KNOW THIS:

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:18.916
I KNOW YOUR DECK
AND I'VE DONE THE MATH.

00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:22.256
IF YOU DRAW, THE ODDS
WILL NOT BE GOOD.

00:11:23.257 --> 00:11:25.795
[THINKING]
THERE'S ONLY A 50% CHANCE
YOU'LL DRAW A MONSTER.

00:11:26.797 --> 00:11:27.264
IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK!

00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:29.234
THIS GUY'S DONE
HIS HOMEWORK ON ME,

00:11:30.236 --> 00:11:30.937
AND I KNOW WHAT HE
WANTS ME TO DO.

00:11:31.938 --> 00:11:33.274
Crows: ALL RIGHT, YUSEI! GO!

00:11:34.276 --> 00:11:34.677
YOU CAN DO IT!
WE'RE WITH YA!

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:36.681
[THINKING]
SO FOR THE SAKE OF MY TEAM,

00:11:37.682 --> 00:11:39.117
I'M SIMPLY NOT
GONNA DO IT, BREO!

00:11:40.119 --> 00:11:42.424
I'LL ACCEPT THE EFFECT
OF TRICOLOR AND DRAW A CARD!

00:11:43.425 --> 00:11:44.894
NO WAY! HE'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT!

00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:46.630
HE'S CHANGING UP
HIS STRATEGY!

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:50.003
THIS ISN'T THE YUSEI
I STUDIED!

00:11:51.472 --> 00:11:54.544
LOOKS LIKE THE RISK
NOT WORTH RISKING WAS
WORTH IT!

00:11:55.546 --> 00:11:58.951
FINE. YOU GOT LUCKY,
BUT IT WON'T CHANGE
ANYTHING IN THE LONG RUN!

00:11:59.953 --> 00:12:03.692
NOW ONE CARD IN MY HAND GOES
TO THE DECK, AND I CAN
SUMMON THE MONSTER I DREW!

00:12:04.694 --> 00:12:05.996
RISE, JUNK SYNCHRON!

00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:07.666
SYNCHRON? OH, NO!

00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:09.970
NOW, LEVEL 3
JUNK SYNCHRON TUNE

00:12:10.971 --> 00:12:14.878
WITH LEVEL 2 CARD
BREAKER AND LEVEL 3
DASH WARRIOR!

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.389
BEHOLD AS SHARDS
OF RAZOR SHARP STEEL

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.595
AND SCRAPS
OF IRONCLAD ALLOY
ARE FORGED TOGETHER

00:12:25.597 --> 00:12:26.664
TO CREATE A POWERFUL
NEW FORCE!

00:12:27.666 --> 00:12:28.134
I SYNCHRO SUMMON!

00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:31.340
JUNK DESTROYER!

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.014
UH-OH! HE DOESN'T
LOOK FRIENDLY!

00:12:37.016 --> 00:12:38.685
AND WHEN JUNK DESTROYER
IS SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.390
I CAN THEN DESTROY
THE SAME NUMBER OF
CARDS ON THE FIELD

00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:43.527
AS THE NUMBER
OF NON-TUNER MONSTERS

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:45.496
THAT WERE USED
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON HIM!

00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:47.467
GO, TIDAL SWEEP!

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:50.872
YEAH! NOW YUSEI
JUST NEEDS TO ATTACK
AND HE'LL BEAT BREO!

00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:52.642
COME ON!
DO IT, YUSEI!

00:12:53.644 --> 00:12:55.079
CONSIDER IT DONE! ATTACK!

00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:58.018
YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
IT'D BE THAT EASY NOW,
DID YOU?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.289
I ACTIVATE DAMAGE LANCE!

00:13:01.356 --> 00:13:04.529
NOW, SINCE A MONSTER
WITH 2000 ATTACK POINTS
ATTACKED ME DIRECTLY

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.968
ONE OF YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS
DECREASES BY 1000

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.475
AND YOU TAKE
1000 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:18.753
PRESS ON!

00:13:19.754 --> 00:13:22.426
GO, FISTS
OF FEROCITY!!

00:13:25.497 --> 00:13:27.902
AAH!

00:13:29.938 --> 00:13:31.341
ALL RIGHT!
BREO'S BEEN BESTED!

00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:34.012
OK, TWO DOWN
AND ONE TO GO!

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.550
[THINKING]
YEAH, BUT THE ONLY
PROBLEM IS,

00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.221
WHEN YUSEI TAKES ON
THAT ONE,

00:13:40.222 --> 00:13:43.595
HE'LL NOW ONLY HAVE
1000 LIFE POINTS!

00:13:56.584 --> 00:13:56.951
SO, JACK,

00:13:57.953 --> 00:13:58.787
TEAM UNICORN'S
THIRD DUELIST--

00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:00.323
IS HE ANY GOOD OR WHAT?

00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:03.829
NOT ONLY IS HE GOOD,
HE MIGHT BE
TEAM UNICORN'S BEST.

00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:07.770
AND WITH YUSEI ALREADY
HANGING ON BY A THREAD,
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:11.776
BUT WE'VE BEEN IN JAMS
BEFORE. YUSEI AT LEAST
STILL HAS A CHANCE, RIGHT?

00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:13.211
MM-HMM.

00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:15.749
[THINKING]
ONE CHANCE IN
A THOUSAND, MAYBE.

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:18.321
YUSEI DUELS WELL,
BUT TO WIN THIS,

00:14:19.323 --> 00:14:21.592
HE'LL HAVE TO DUEL
PERFECTLY.

00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:25.800
SORRY, JEAN. I JUST
COULDN'T FINISH IT.

00:14:26.802 --> 00:14:28.271
DON'T SWEAT IT, BREO.
HE JUST GOT LUCKY.

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:31.076
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE OUTPLAYED YOU
OR ANYTHING.

00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:33.079
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.017
IT'S JUST I THOUGHT
I KNEW ALL HIS TACTICS,

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:39.523
BUT THEN HE DID
SOMETHING COMPLETELY
UNEXPECTED!

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:41.727
I KNOW, BREO.

00:14:42.729 --> 00:14:45.200
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN A DUELIST RUNS OUT
OF ALL HIS OPTIONS.

00:14:46.201 --> 00:14:48.772
HE STARTS PANICKING
AND MAKING DESPERATE,
LAST-DITCH MOVES

00:14:49.774 --> 00:14:52.612
TO TRY AND WIN,
BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO WORK.

00:14:53.614 --> 00:14:54.215
I WILL SEE TO THAT.

00:14:55.217 --> 00:14:58.722
MC: WELL, DUEL FANS,
HERE WE GO--THE FINAL
CONFRONTATION!

00:14:59.724 --> 00:15:01.394
A SMACK DOWN
WITH SUPER-SIZED STAKES

00:15:02.362 --> 00:15:03.831
BETWEEN THE TWO TEAM'S
LAST TWO DUELISTS!

00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:05.834
ON ONE RUNNER
WE HAVE YUSEI FUDO,

00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:08.239
WHOSE FANS MUST BE
BREATHING A SIGH OF RELIEF

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.242
THAT HE MADE IT THROUGH
HIS LAST MELEE,

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.446
BUT CAN HE MAINTAIN
THE MOMENTUM?

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:16.987
AFTER ALL, HE'S NOW
FACING TEAM UNICORN'S
CRAFTY CAPTAIN, JEAN!

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:21.294
CONGRATS ON LASTING
THIS LONG, BUT NOW
YOUR TIME IS UP.

00:15:22.295 --> 00:15:24.266
YOU'VE BEEN
CALLING THE SHOTS SINCE
THE START, HAVEN'T YOU?

00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:25.668
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.173
EVEN BACK WHEN ANDRE
AND I FIRST DUELED,

00:15:29.174 --> 00:15:32.145
THAT WAS ALL SET UP BY YOU
JUST SO YOU'D KNOW MORE
ABOUT OUR DUEL TACTICS.

00:15:33.147 --> 00:15:35.318
DON'T BE SORE.
I SIMPLY DID WHAT
I HAD TO FOR THE EDGE.

00:15:36.286 --> 00:15:38.022
THE EDGE?
OH, REALLY?

00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:41.228
OVER THE COURSE
OF THIS DUEL, JEAN,

00:15:42.229 --> 00:15:44.233
I'VE LEARNED QUITE
A BIT ABOUT TEAMWORK,

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:46.736
AND I'VE LEARNED IT
BY WATCHING YOU THREE,

00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:50.543
WHICH IS WHY I'M STUMPED
WHY YOU WOULD WANT
TO WIN THIS WAY--

00:15:51.545 --> 00:15:54.684
BEATING ME BY TAKING AWAY
WHAT'S MOST PRIZED
TO A DUELIST--HIS CARDS.

00:15:55.686 --> 00:15:56.720
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
MORE HEART THAN THAT.

00:15:57.722 --> 00:15:58.691
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
WANTED TO WIN WITH FORCE,

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.629
NOT BY FINDING
SOME TECHNICALITY.

00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:04.067
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR YUSEI'S MIND GAMES.

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:06.203
TEAM UNICORN
NEVER HOLDS BACK.

00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:09.208
WHEN WE SEE A WEAKNESS,
WE STRIKE WITH
ALL OUR MIGHT.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.644
BUT IT WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THAT;

00:16:11.646 --> 00:16:14.885
AT LEAST, NOT WHEN
WE WERE ALL STILL
ON OUR OWN.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:22.765
Man: COMMAND KNIGHT,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:29.276
ALL RIGHT!
VICTORY IS MINE!

00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:31.212
TOUGH LUCK, BRO.

00:16:32.214 --> 00:16:34.785
COME BACK ANY TIME
IF YOU WANT TO GET
YOUR BUTT KICKED AGAIN!

00:16:35.787 --> 00:16:37.423
HA HA HA HA!

00:16:41.162 --> 00:16:43.133
JUST AS I THOUGHT--
YOU COULD'VE BEATEN HIM,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.169
SO TELL ME THEN, STRANGER,

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:46.605
WHY DIDN'T YOU PLAY THIS?

00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:48.575
IT WOULD'VE WON YOU
THE DUEL.

00:16:49.577 --> 00:16:52.315
LET ME GUESS, YOU HELD BACK
OUT PITY FOR YOUR OPPONENT.

00:16:53.317 --> 00:16:54.385
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING,

00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:58.291
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO THAT
BECAUSE YOUR OPPONENT HAS
NO PITY FOR YOU.

00:16:59.293 --> 00:17:00.295
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

00:17:01.363 --> 00:17:04.703
I KNOW BECAUSE I WAS
ONCE LIKE YOU.

00:17:06.038 --> 00:17:07.574
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE JOIN FORCES?

00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:09.010
JOIN FORCES?

00:17:10.011 --> 00:17:11.681
YES, DUEL TOGETHER
ON THE SAME TEAM,

00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:14.653
BECAUSE ON A TEAM,
YOU WIN AT ANY COST.

00:17:15.654 --> 00:17:18.726
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR PITY
BECAUSE YOUR TEAMMATES
ARE COUNTING ON YOU.

00:17:19.728 --> 00:17:21.664
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:25.204
GOOD. THEN OUR BOND
IS FORGED.

00:17:26.206 --> 00:17:27.842
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GOING TO BREAK
THAT BOND NOW

00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:29.845
BY SHOWING YUSEI
ANY PITY.

00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:33.083
MY TEAMMATES ARE
COUNTING ON ME.

00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:34.519
FAREWELL, YUSEI.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.558
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR TEAM UNICORN
TO LOWER ITS HORN,

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:41.331
CHARGE IN, AND FINISH
YOU AND TEAM 5D's OFF
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.935
IT'S OVER!

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:01.065
IT'S MY TURN!

00:18:02.867 --> 00:18:04.670
I SUMMON
TRIDENT WARRIOR!

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:11.082
AND WHEN THIS CARD'S
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:18:12.084 --> 00:18:13.553
I'M THEN ALLOWED
TO SUMMON ONE
LEVEL 3 MONSTER

00:18:14.554 --> 00:18:16.591
DIRECTLY
FROM MY HAND OUT TO
THE FIELD OF BATTLE!

00:18:17.592 --> 00:18:21.332
AND THE LEVEL 3
MONSTER I'M SUMMONING
IS DELTA FLYER!

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:25.506
NOW I'LL PLAY
DELTA FLYER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:26.508 --> 00:18:28.044
ONCE PER TURN,
IT LETS ME INCREASE
THE LEVEL OF A MONSTER

00:18:29.045 --> 00:18:30.915
ON MY FIELD OTHER THAN
DELTA BY ONE POINT!

00:18:31.916 --> 00:18:34.454
SO, TRIDENT WARRIOR,
POWER UP TO LEVEL 5!

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:36.424
BUT I'M NOT DONE
WITH YOU YET!

00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:39.930
NOW, TUNE WITH LEVEL 3
DELTA FLYER!

00:18:40.932 --> 00:18:43.436
LET THE SKIES OPEN UP
AND NOW GIVE WAY

00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:47.710
TO A GLEAMING BEAST
OF ELECTRIC MIGHT!

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.883
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
LIGHTNING TRICORN!

00:18:53.253 --> 00:18:54.989
Woman: WHEN LIGHTNING TRICORN
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:59.664
YOU CAN SUMMON THUNDER UNICORN
OR VOLTIC BICORN FROM
YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:19:01.734 --> 00:19:03.036
NOW, TRICORN,

00:19:03.036 --> 00:19:04.672
CHARGE AND CRUSH
JUNK DESTROYER!

00:19:05.674 --> 00:19:06.843
OH, NO!

00:19:06.843 --> 00:19:07.444
YUSEI'S MONSTER
WILL BE MUSH

00:19:08.446 --> 00:19:09.013
IF THIS ATTACK HITS!

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:11.184
THIS CAN'T BE.

00:19:11.184 --> 00:19:12.653
YUSEI! DON'T LET IT
END LIKE THIS!

00:19:13.654 --> 00:19:15.424
I WON'T, AND I HAVE
SHIELD WARRIOR TO THANK!

00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:18.362
HE'S IN THE GRAVEYARD,
BUT BY REMOVING HIM
FROM PLAY,

00:19:19.363 --> 00:19:20.966
I CAN STOP A MONSTER
FROM BEING DESTROYED
IN BATTLE!

00:19:21.968 --> 00:19:23.204
YEAH? BUT YOU
STILL TAKE DAMAGE!

00:19:24.206 --> 00:19:25.641
[GROANING]

00:19:26.642 --> 00:19:28.145
GUESS I HAVE YOUR TEAM
TO THANK FOR THAT ONE.

00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:30.616
YOU'RE THE ONES WHO SENT
WARRIOR TO THE GRAVE.

00:19:31.618 --> 00:19:33.054
ENJOY THE MOMENT.
HUH?

00:19:34.056 --> 00:19:34.957
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
GOING TO LAST,

00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:37.995
NOT WITH THE SPEED SPELL
I HAVE RIGHT HERE
IN MY HAND!

00:19:38.997 --> 00:19:39.999
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.835
I CAN PLAY
SPEED WORLD 2,

00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:43.838
SO NOW, BY USING
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.876
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:19:46.877 --> 00:19:47.879
AND THAT'S
ALL THE POINTS
YOU HAVE LEFT!

00:19:48.881 --> 00:19:50.917
ALL HIS POINTS?
WAIT. SO THEN
THAT WOULD MEAN--

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:54.857
IT WOULD MEAN YUSEI
WOULD LOSE THE DUEL.

00:19:56.059 --> 00:19:56.995
GOOD-BYE, YUSEI!

00:19:57.996 --> 00:20:01.167
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
BUT THIS GUY IS!

00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:03.839
BY REMOVING DAMAGE EATER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:20:04.841 --> 00:20:05.475
AND ONE CARD IN
MY HAND FROM PLAY,

00:20:06.477 --> 00:20:07.979
I CAN NEGATE DAMAGE
FROM YOUR EFFECT,

00:20:08.981 --> 00:20:12.120
AND THEN ADD
TO MY LIFE POINTS THE
AMOUNT I WOULD'VE LOST!

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:18.196
WITH SO FEW CARDS
IN HIS DECK, HE'S USING
THE ONES IN HIS GRAVE!

00:20:19.198 --> 00:20:22.704
Jean: IRONIC- HE'S CLINGING
TO LIFE BY USING CARDS
THAT HAVE MET THEIR DEMISE,

00:20:23.706 --> 00:20:26.611
BUT ONE CAN ONLY CLING
FOR SO LONG. HE'LL SEE.

00:20:27.613 --> 00:20:29.616
MY DRAW!

00:20:30.618 --> 00:20:32.087
I PLAY THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2!

00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:34.257
NOW, BY REMOVING
TEN SPEED COUNTERS,

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:37.062
I CAN DESTROY
LIGHTNING TRICORN!

00:20:38.064 --> 00:20:42.237
NEXT I'LL HAVE
JUNK DESTROYER
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:20:43.773 --> 00:20:44.642
YOU'LL DO NO SUCH THING!

00:20:45.643 --> 00:20:47.614
GO, REANIMATION WAVE!

00:20:48.615 --> 00:20:50.285
THANKS TO THIS TRAP,
SINCE A SYNCHRO ATTACKS,

00:20:51.286 --> 00:20:53.123
ALL BATTLE DAMAGE IS
CUT IN HALF!

00:20:54.124 --> 00:20:56.629
AND THEN I CAN SUMMON
A SYNCHRO MONSTER FROM
THE GRAVEYARD

00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:00.669
WHOSE LEVEL IS THE SAME
AS THAT OF THE SYNCHRO
MONSTER THAT JUST ATTACKED!

00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:03.273
SO RISE,
LIGHTNING TRICORN!

00:21:04.274 --> 00:21:08.248
THEN YOU RISE,
TOO, SONIC CHICK,
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.419
WITH THAT,
I'LL END MY TURN,

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.291
SO GO ON, JEAN, AND DO
YOUR VERY WORST. GO!

00:21:15.293 --> 00:21:16.863
I THINK THE PRESSURE IS
STARTING TO GET TO HIM.

00:21:17.865 --> 00:21:19.067
I THINK IT'S
GETTING TO US ALL!

00:21:20.068 --> 00:21:21.103
[WHIMPERING]

00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:23.808
MY TURN NOW!

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.516
FIRST, I SUMMON
RHINOTAURUS!

00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:32.122
NEXT I'LL HAVE LIGHTNING
TRICORN ATTACK

00:21:33.123 --> 00:21:35.294
JUNK DESTROYER!

00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:38.966
[GROANING]

00:21:39.968 --> 00:21:40.402
BUT THERE'S MORE!

00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:45.411
NOW RHINOTAURUS WILL
ATTACK SONIC CHICK!

00:21:49.785 --> 00:21:51.121
OH! I CAN HARDLY
BEAR TO WATCH!

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:54.159
THEN I THINK NOW
MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
TO CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:21:54.246 --> 00:21:55.990
AND NOW FOR THE BEST PART!

00:21:56.382 --> 00:21:58.384
SINCE TWO OF YOUR MONSTERS
WERE DESTROYED THIS TURN,

00:21:59.385 --> 00:22:02.555
RHINOTAURUS CAN ATTACK
A SECOND TIME!

00:22:03.556 --> 00:22:04.757
NOT GOOD.

00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:05.224
SO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

00:22:06.225 --> 00:22:07.226
GOOD-BYE, YUSEI!

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:10.363
TAKE HIM OUT, RHINOTAURUS!

00:22:11.597 --> 00:22:12.598
YUSEI!

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:14.300
NO!
NO!
NO!
