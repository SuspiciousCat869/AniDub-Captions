WEBVTT

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:02.936
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.873
THANK YOU FOR TAKING
THE TIME TO SEE ME,
MR. FUDO.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:10.010
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I NEED YOU TO SAVE
MY DAUGHTER AKIZA.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.145
SHE'S IN
THE HOSPITAL,
SUFFERING FROM

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.281
SOME HEARTBREAK
THAT'S MY FAULT!

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:15.716
I PUSHED HER AWAY,

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.318
AND SHE JOINED
THAT ARCADIA
MOVEMENT.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.021
I CAN'T HEAL
HER BROKEN HEART,
BUT YOU CAN.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.057
JACK THINKS
THAT YOU JUST NEED
TO DUEL HER AGAIN!

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.559
HE SAID YOUR VOICE
HAS THE POWER

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.761
TO WAKE AKIZA
FROM HER COMA.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:31.532
IT'S ME.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.002
YUSEI.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.174
YUSEI?

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.209
AKIZA!

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.711
HUH? WHAT ARE THEY
DOING HERE?!

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.948
THAT STRANGER OVER THERE
RUINED MY LIFE!

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:51.084
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ERASE
THE PAST, DON'T BOTHER!

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.021
I HAVE ALREADY FORGOT
ABOUT THEM!

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:58.058
AND NOW I THINK
I'LL ERASE YOU FROM
MY MEMORIES AS WELL!

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.426
DON'T DO THIS!

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.628
YOU ALL WANT
TO DESTROY MY LIFE!

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.464
WELL, I WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.634
Yusei: IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.803
AND PROVE THAT WE'RE
ALL TRYING TO HELP YOU!

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.373
DUEL, HUH? I THOUGHT
THAT YOU NEVER WERE
GONNA ASK ME!

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.376
AKIZA, THE ONLY TIME
I EVER GOT THROUGH

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.645
TO THE REAL YOU WAS
DURING OUR DUEL.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:20.514
SO THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.648
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.116
I'M THE BLACK ROSE,

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:27.487
AND I SYNCHRO SUMMON
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.722
All: AAH!

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.724
I THOUGHT YOU REALLY
BELIEVED IN ME,

00:01:30.724 --> 00:01:32.893
BUT IT WAS
ALL ABOUT MY MARK.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.228
I'LL NEVER DUEL FOR YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.397

MY LITTLE GIRL.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.439
YOU'RE GOING
TO REGRET INTERFERING
IN MY LIFE, YUSEI,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.275
BECAUSE ONCE I REMOVE
MY EVIL THORN FROM PLAY,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.745
MY DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY
REDUCES THE POWER
OF YOUR WARRIOR

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:01.014
AND FORCES IT
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:04.317
GO, BLACK ROSE GALE!

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.026
AND NOW THAT
SHIELD WARRIOR IS HELPLESS,

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.962
BLACK ROSE DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.667
I TRIGGER
THE REALIZE DEFENSE
TRAP CARD!

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.637
Duel Runner Computer:
IF A MONSTER THAT'S IN ATTACK
MODE HAS MORE DEFENSE POINTS

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:28.942
THAN ATTACK POINTS,
THE REALIZE DEFENSE TRAP CARD
SWITCHES IT TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.879
AND SINCE MY SHIELD
WARRIOR IS A BETTER
GUARD THAN ATTACKER,

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.416
I CAN NOW MAKE
THE MOST OUT OF
A STICKY SITUATION.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.785
DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU,
BLACK ROSE!

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.493
BUT YOUR THORN
OF MALICE EQUIP
SPELL

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.729
WON'T LET YOU
DESTROY A MONSTER
IN BATTLE.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.164
THAT'S TRUE, BUT SINCE
MY DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.133
ARE GREATER THAN
SHIELD WARRIOR'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.169
YOU'RE STILL GONNA GET
SLAMMED WITH DAMAGE.

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:03.043
YUSEI!

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:04.511
YOU MAY HAVE MANAGED

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.481
TO SPARE SHIELD WARRIOR
A MAJOR THRASHING,

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:12.486
BUT THE THORN OF MALICE
STILL WEAKENS HIS ATTACK
AND DEFENSE ABILITIES.

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:13.754
OH, NO!

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.223
WITH YUSEI'S MONSTER
NOT FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS,

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:19.593
AKIZA'S GONNA BLAST AWAY
HIS LIFE POINTS NEXT ROUND.

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.629
I END MY TURN.

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.632
DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO MAKE THIS QUICK, YUSEI.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:28.735
I'M GOING TO WATCH YOU SQUIRM.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.871
AKIZA,

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.839
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.841
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
AND SCARED,

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.345
BUT THAT MARK
ON YOUR ARM MEANS
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.380
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS THING TOGETHER.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.848
DON'T BOTHER, YUSEI.

00:04:41.848 --> 00:04:44.251
STOP TRYING TO REACH ME.

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:46.753
I GET IT.
YOU'RE THE GOOD GUY.

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.789
YOU LIKE SAVING PEOPLE.

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:50.757
BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE ME.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.226
NO ONE CAN. NOT NOW.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.730
ONLY ONE PERSON REALLY GOT ME,
REALLY TRIED TO HELP ME.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.001
ONLY ONE PERSON UNDERSTOOD
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE ME.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.436
DAD DOESN'T. YOU DON'T.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.871
JUST SAYER, AND HE'S...

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.474
AAH...

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.346
NO!

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:17.417
WITH HIM MISSING,
THERE'S NO PLACE LEFT
THAT I CAN CALL HOME.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.885
IT'S JUST ME.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.787
AND I DON'T FEEL
LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT!

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.789
AKIZA,
YOU DO HAVE A HOME.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.960
YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
A HOME WITH
YOUR FAMILY.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.428
THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:30.397
WAIT. MY FAMILY?

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.866
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD GO HOME
AND PLAY HOUSE

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.368
WITH THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE,
THE ONES WHO SENT ME AWAY

00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.070
'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT
I WAS A MONSTER?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.572
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:41.508
MY REAL FAMILY IS GONE!

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:43.543
THERE IS
NOWHERE LEFT FOR ME!

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.045
AAH!
AAH!

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:50.317
[GROANS]
AKIZA.

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.652
[THINKING]
THIS IS BAD.

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.154
THE ANGRIER
AKIZA GETS,

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:56.122
THE STRONGER
HER POWER GETS,

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.158
AND THE MORE
DANGEROUS
THE SITUATION IS

00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:02.262
FOR EVERYONE HERE,
INCLUDING HER.

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:04.331
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:06.967
[GRUNTS]

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.935
I REVEAL MY TRAP!

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:10.403
REINFORCE TRUTH!

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:11.805
BY NOT BATTLING
THIS TURN,

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:14.307
I CAN USE
THIS TRAP CARD TO
SUMMON ANY MONSTER

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:16.610
WITH LESS THAN
A THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.813
I SUMMON
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:26.052
AND NEXT, I'LL
BRING OUT MY FAVORITE
TUNER MONSTER...

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.255
JUNK SYNCHRON!

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:33.693
[THINKING]
THOSE 3 MONSTERS ARE USELESS
AGAINST AKISA'S DRAGON, UNLESS...

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:37.230
Yusei: I TUNE JUNK SYNCHRON
WITH SHIELD WARRIOR
AND SPEED WARRIOR

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.401
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.376
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:57.417
COOL MOVE,

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.453
BUT HER DRAGON HAS MORE
ATTACK POINTS THAN STARDUST.

00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.922
SO IF THEY DUKE IT OUT,

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.957
STARDUST DRAGON
WON'T SURVIVE

00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:06.626
AND NEITHER WILL YUSEI.

00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:23.437
Yusei:
YOUR MOVE, AKIZA.

00:07:23.437 --> 00:07:25.306
Akiza: SO WHAT'S
YOUR ENDGAME, YUSEI?

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:28.609
ARE YOU COUNTING
ON STARDUST DRAGON
TO PROTECT YOU?

00:07:28.609 --> 00:07:30.478
TO PROTECT
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS?

00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:32.480
HEH! DON'T TRY
TO FOOL YOURSELF.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.914
YOU CAN'T PROTECT THEM.

00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:36.350
AND YOU CERTAINLY
CAN'T SAVE YOURSELF.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.420
YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE STARDUST
SUFFER FOR NOTHING,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.356
BUT MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT,
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

00:07:42.356 --> 00:07:44.659
I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO BE OF SERVICE,

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:47.061
STARTING RIGHT NOW!

00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:49.563
GO FORTH, MY MIGHTY BEAST!
ATTACK!

00:07:49.563 --> 00:07:52.566
SLICE AWAY
AT STARDUST DRAGON!

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:54.268
[ROARING]

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.376
AAH!

00:08:02.376 --> 00:08:04.345
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR YOUR BEAST,

00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:06.814
THORN OF MALICE PREVENTS ME
FROM DESTROYING IT,

00:08:06.814 --> 00:08:11.485
SO I GET TO DISH OUT
A WORLD OF HURT OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!

00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:13.287
[ROARING]

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:16.524
AAH!

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:20.861
I DON'T LIKE HER
WHEN SHE'S ANGRY.

00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:24.565
AKIZA!
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THIS!

00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:27.301
PLEASE, STOP!
LET'S TALK
THIS OUT.

00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:29.270
NOT A CHANCE, DAD.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.772
IT'S MY TURN!

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:33.207
FROM MY HAND,

00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:35.376
I'M ACTIVATING
THE HALF SHUT
SPELL CARD!

00:08:35.376 --> 00:08:38.979
AND WITH IT, I CAN CUT
THE ATTACK POINTS OF
ONE MONSTER IN HALF!

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:40.915
IN EXCHANGE,
THAT MONSTER CAN'T

00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:42.917
BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE THIS TURN.

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:46.620
AND I THINK
I'LL CHOOSE YOUR
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:50.658
OH, YEAH!
NOW HIS STARDUST

00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:53.127
IS MORE POWERFUL
AND HAS THE UPPER HAND!

00:08:53.127 --> 00:08:56.364
[THINKING]
THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI. YOU NEED
TO GET ON THE OFFENSIVE.

00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:58.299
IF YOU WON'T LISTEN
TO ME AND YOUR DAD,

00:08:58.332 --> 00:09:01.268
THEN MAYBE YOU'LL
LISTEN TO THE POWER
OF MY DECK!

00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:05.306
STARDUST DRAGON,
ATTACK WITH
COSMIC FLARE!

00:09:05.306 --> 00:09:07.508
[ROARS]

00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:16.584
WAS THAT LITTLE MOVE
SUPPOSED TO SCARE ME
OR SOMETHING?

00:09:16.584 --> 00:09:19.520
NO, BUT THESE TWO
FACEDOWNS MIGHT.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.021
YOU'LL NEED MORE
THAN THAT,

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:24.558
ESPECIALLY SINCE
MY DRAGON GETS ALL OF ITS
ATTACK POINTS BACK NOW.

00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:26.127
[ROARS]

00:09:26.127 --> 00:09:28.295
THIS SHOULD BE FUN.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:29.797
BLACK ROSE DRAGON,

00:09:29.797 --> 00:09:32.299
ATTACK HIS FRAGILE FIEND
ONCE AGAIN!

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:34.001
[ROARS]

00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:37.505
[ROARS]

00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:40.708
AAH!

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:43.210
YOU OUGHT TO RELEASE
STARDUST DRAGON

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.246
AND PUT IT OUT
OF ITS MISERY, YUSEI.

00:09:45.246 --> 00:09:47.915
IT'S ONLY GOING
TO EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN

00:09:47.915 --> 00:09:50.384
AS IT GETS WEAKER
AND WEAKER.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.956
[THINKING]
YUSEI IS DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN.

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:58.492
HE'S TRYING
TO HELP HER, TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HER.

00:09:58.492 --> 00:10:01.462
BUT SHE WON'T LISTEN
TO ANYONE.

00:10:01.462 --> 00:10:04.832
I WAS RIGHT BACK THEN.
SHE IS A MONSTER.

00:10:04.832 --> 00:10:07.768
AAH!

00:10:08.903 --> 00:10:10.971
NO, NO,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:12.940
SHE'S JUST SCARED
OF HERSELF.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.575
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT BACK THEN

00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:17.077
BECAUSE I WAS
TOO AFRAID TO BE
A GOOD FATHER.

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:20.114
IF SHE IS A MONSTER,
THEN I CREATED
THAT MONSTER

00:10:20.114 --> 00:10:22.583
BY TURNING
MY BACK ON HER.

00:10:24.351 --> 00:10:26.353
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:10:26.353 --> 00:10:28.122
YOUR MOVE, YUSEI.

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:29.490
LET'S DO THIS.

00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:32.193
[THINKING]
WHERE IS IT?

00:10:32.193 --> 00:10:35.696
I CAN'T PLAY
THE MOVE I WANT UNTIL
I GET SILVER WING.

00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:37.898
I'M PLACING
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:10:37.898 --> 00:10:39.867
AND ENDING MY TURN.

00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:42.903
WOW. NO BIG ATTACKS?
NO BIG SPEECH?

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:46.340
WHAT'S UP?
YOU RUN OUT OF THINGS
TO DO AND SAY?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.342
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA SAVE ME.

00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:51.545
GIVEN UP ON ME ALREADY?
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE?

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:55.716
NOT A CHANCE.
YOU CAN TRY TO PUSH ME
AWAY ALL YOU WANT.

00:10:55.716 --> 00:10:58.819
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
BY NOW THAT I'LL NEVER
GIVE UP ON YOU.

00:10:58.819 --> 00:11:01.188
I WON'T DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT ME.

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:05.759
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TO ME, I NEVER GIVE UP
ON MY FRIENDS.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.127
OH!
OH!

00:11:07.127 --> 00:11:08.863
HMM.

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:11.398
I'M YOUR FRIEND?

00:11:11.398 --> 00:11:13.968
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING
TO SHOW YOU.

00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.303
THAT'S WHY I WON'T
GIVE UP ON THIS DUEL.

00:11:16.337 --> 00:11:19.907
YOU'RE ONLY SAYING
ALL THIS STUFF
TO MAKE ME STOP.

00:11:19.907 --> 00:11:22.977
I'M NO DUMMY.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:11:22.977 --> 00:11:25.412
I'LL SAY I'M SORRY.
EVERYONE'LL HUG.

00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:27.848
AND THEN YOU'LL JUST
SHIP ME OFF SOMEWHERE.

00:11:27.848 --> 00:11:29.517
WELL,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK!

00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:31.018
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:33.554
CRIPPLE HIS DECREPIT CREATURE!
NOW ATTACK!

00:11:33.554 --> 00:11:35.222
[ROARS]

00:11:39.193 --> 00:11:41.629
I FELL FOR THIS
"WE'RE HERE FOR YOU" BIT ONCE,

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:44.498
RIGHT BEFORE
MY DAD SENT ME AWAY.
OH!

00:11:44.498 --> 00:11:48.035
REMEMBER, DAD?
RIGHT BEFORE YOU FORCED ME
TO LEAVE AND SHIPPED ME OFF,

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:50.037
YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU CARED ABOUT ME.

00:11:50.037 --> 00:11:53.674
WELL, NOW YUSEI'S GONNA PAY
FOR YOUR MISTAKES!

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.418
STOP THIS, AKIZA!

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:14.921
STOP HURTING PEOPLE MORE
THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE!

00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.323
OUTTA THE WAY!

00:12:17.323 --> 00:12:20.092
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP...
DEFENSE DRAW!

00:12:20.092 --> 00:12:23.563
AND WITH IT, I CAN
STOP YOUR BLACK ROSE
DRAGON'S ATTACK!

00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:27.667
[GROANS]

00:12:29.402 --> 00:12:33.105
NEXT UP,
I DRAW ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.442
SORRY, AKIZA.

00:12:36.442 --> 00:12:38.878
I... I WASN'T AS GOOD
A FATHER AS...

00:12:38.878 --> 00:12:41.547
SAVE IT.
IT'S ALL TOO LITTLE
AND TOO LATE.

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:45.117
I ADMIT IT.
I WAS SCARED
OF YOUR POWER.

00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:47.086
I WAS SCARED OF YOU.

00:12:47.086 --> 00:12:48.554
HUH?

00:12:48.554 --> 00:12:52.058
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR... YOUR
ABILITIES.

00:12:52.058 --> 00:12:54.594
YOU JUST... YOU REALLY
FRIGHTENED ME.

00:12:54.594 --> 00:12:59.065
YEAH, I KNOW ALL OF THIS.
THAT'S WHY YOU DECIDED
TO GET RID OF ME.

00:12:59.065 --> 00:13:01.934
YOU WERE SCARED.
SCARED OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

00:13:01.968 --> 00:13:03.402
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:13:03.402 --> 00:13:06.906
YOU HAD POWERS
I COULDN'T COMPREHEND
AND THAT TERRIFIED ME.

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:09.308
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON.

00:13:09.308 --> 00:13:12.778
I WAS DISAPPOINTED
IN MYSELF FOR NOT BEING
ABLE TO DEAL WITH YOU.

00:13:12.778 --> 00:13:16.882
HAVING YOU AROUND
MADE ME FEEL POWERLESS,
LIKE A FAILURE.

00:13:16.882 --> 00:13:18.851
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:20.519
THIS IS ABOUT YOU NOW?!

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:23.022
YES, IT'S ABOUT ME
LETTING YOU DOWN.

00:13:23.022 --> 00:13:25.591
I NEVER STOPPED CARING
ABOUT YOU, AKIZA.

00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:27.593
NEITHER DID YOUR MOTHER.

00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:29.929
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
OUR LITTLE GIRL.

00:13:29.962 --> 00:13:32.932
STOP!
JUST STOP TALKING, DAD!

00:13:32.965 --> 00:13:34.934
NO WAY AM I FALLING
FOR THIS.

00:13:34.967 --> 00:13:37.703
AKIZA!

00:13:37.703 --> 00:13:40.139
DUE TO THORN
OF MALICE'S POWER,

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:44.176
YOUR BELOVED STARDUST DRAGON
LOSES 600 MORE ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:44.176 --> 00:13:46.078
[ROARING]

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:50.016
NOW FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE WONDER CLOVER SPELL!

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:54.553
BY REMOVING ONE LEVEL-4 MONSTER
FROM MY HAND AND SENDING IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:57.990
I CAN GIVE ONE OF MY MONSTERS
THE POWER TO ATTACK TWICE.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.759
AKIZA, PLEASE,
STOP THIS!

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:01.727
GO, BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:04.230
ATTACK STARDUST
ONE MORE TIME!

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.199
AND THIS TIME,
IF MY DAD GETS IN THE WAY,

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.235
THEN TAKE HIM OUT, TOO!

00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:12.872
YUSEI BETTER DO SOMETHING
OR HIS DRAGON'S DONE FOR.

00:14:14.373 --> 00:14:17.109
I ACTIVATE
THE IRON RESOLVE
TRAP CARD!

00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:19.078
BY HALVING
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:21.147
I CAN AVOID
THE EFFECT
OF THIS ATTACK.

00:14:21.147 --> 00:14:22.682
WHATEVER! I MEAN,

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:25.885
STARDUST DRAGON'S
STILL GONNA LOSE
MORE ATTACK POINTS.

00:14:25.885 --> 00:14:28.554
[ROARING]

00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:31.357
LOOK AT IT.
IT'S SO WEAK NOW.

00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:33.693
[ROARING]

00:14:33.693 --> 00:14:35.728
NEXT, I REVEAL
MY TRAP CARD...

00:14:35.728 --> 00:14:38.197
DOOM PETAL COUNTDOWN!

00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:40.633
I CAN CHANNEL THIS CARD'S
INCREDIBLE POWER

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:44.670
BY REMOVING
ONE PLANT-TYPE MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.672
THEN I CAN USE
THAT POWER TO SLAM YOU

00:14:46.672 --> 00:14:49.108
WITH 300 POINTS
OF DIRECT DAMAGE.

00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:51.110
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO MOVE, SIR!

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.412
OH!

00:14:53.412 --> 00:14:55.581
[GROANING]

00:14:56.582 --> 00:14:58.017
ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:14:58.017 --> 00:15:00.586
IS REMOVE ONE MORE
PLANT MONSTER FROM PLAY

00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:04.056
ON MY NEXT TURN
AND YOU'RE FINISHED, YUSEI.

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:06.058
MAKE THE MOST
OF YOUR NEXT MOVE,

00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:07.893
'CAUSE IT'LL BE YOUR LAST.

00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:10.396
[THINKING]
SHE'S DONE MAKING
HER MOVE,

00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:14.600
BUT HER POWER IS
STILL GOING CRAZY.

00:15:16.102 --> 00:15:17.570
UHH!

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.507
OF COURSE.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO CONTROL HER POWER.

00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:27.079
AKIZA.

00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:29.248
DARLING, NO!

00:15:30.316 --> 00:15:32.251
MY LITTLE GIRL,

00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:34.286
PLEASE GIVE US
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:15:34.286 --> 00:15:35.821
COME HOME TO US,
AKIZA.

00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:37.823
COME HOME TO... AAH!

00:15:37.823 --> 00:15:40.393
STAY BACK.
I'M NOT KIDDING!

00:15:40.393 --> 00:15:42.428
MOVE, SIR!
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT!

00:15:42.428 --> 00:15:43.896
I DON'T CARE!

00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:45.831
I DON'T CARE
IF SHE HURTS ME.

00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:49.368
AFTER ALL,
WHEN SHE WAS HURTING,
I TURNED MY BACK ON HER.

00:15:49.368 --> 00:15:51.904
WHEN SHE NEEDED ME,
I TURNED AWAY.

00:15:51.904 --> 00:15:53.639
I WON'T TURN AWAY
FROM HER AGAIN.

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:56.675
THAT ALL SOUNDS REALLY SWEET,
BUT YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

00:15:56.675 --> 00:15:58.711
HE DOES!
HUH?

00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:00.179
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:02.114
PEOPLE DESERVE
SECOND CHANCES.

00:16:02.114 --> 00:16:05.184
GIVE YOUR PARENTS
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW
THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:07.119
I MEAN,
TAKE IT FROM ME.

00:16:07.119 --> 00:16:09.622
IN A WAY,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
REALLY LUCKY.

00:16:09.622 --> 00:16:11.824
YOU HAVE
A REAL FAMILY.

00:16:11.824 --> 00:16:14.493
A REAL FAMILY?

00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:22.334
NO, I... UH-UH!

00:16:22.334 --> 00:16:24.804
I'M GOING TO PROVE
TO YOU THAT YOU'RE
MY FRIEND.

00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:27.873
I'M GONNA RISK
EVERYTHING TO SHOW YOU
THAT I CARE,

00:16:27.873 --> 00:16:29.275
AND YOU WON'T STOP ME!

00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:31.277
[THINKING]
PERFECT!

00:16:31.277 --> 00:16:35.514
I EQUIP STARDUST DRAGON
WITH THE SILVER WING
SPELL CARD!

00:16:37.716 --> 00:16:41.720
THEN I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL RELEASE
RESTRAINT WAVE.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.756
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO WITH THAT?

00:16:43.756 --> 00:16:46.158
I'M GONNA HARNESS
THIS SPELL'S ENERGY

00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:48.794
BY DESTROYING
ONE EQUIP SPELL
ON MY FIELD.

00:16:48.794 --> 00:16:50.729
NOW I'VE GOT
THE POWER TO DESTROY

00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:53.365
EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD
YOU HAVE IN PLAY.

00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:55.034
HUH? OH!

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.539
MY THORN OF MALICE...
IS HISTORY,

00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:04.543
AND SINCE BLACK ROSE DRAGON
WAS GETTING ITS SPECIAL
POWERS FROM THAT TRAP,

00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:09.748
BOTH OF OUR DRAGONS'
ATTACK POINTS RETURN
TO NORMAL!

00:17:09.748 --> 00:17:12.117
NO WAY!
YES WAY!

00:17:12.117 --> 00:17:13.586
NOW, STARDUST DRAGON,

00:17:13.586 --> 00:17:15.621
ATTACK
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:18.290
GO! COSMIC FLARE!

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.799
[GRUNTING]

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:30.302
FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE EFFECT OF HEDGE GUARD!

00:17:30.302 --> 00:17:32.505
BY SENDING THIS CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:35.541
I CAN PROTECT ONE MONSTER
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:37.009
NICE TRY, YUSEI,

00:17:37.009 --> 00:17:38.777
BUT YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

00:17:38.777 --> 00:17:41.680
IT'S TIME I END THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.550
[GROANING]

00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:02.707
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO END THIS CHARADE.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:05.210
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME
AND NEITHER DOES MY FATHER.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.679
SAYER'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO EVER UNDERSTOOD ME,

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:11.149
AND NOW HE'S VANISHED
FROM MY LIFE JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE HAS.

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:12.183
AKIZA.

00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:15.053
DAD, DON'T. GET BACK.

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:18.390
I CAN'T STOP IT.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.925
MY POWERS
WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:22.660
AAH!

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.064
STOP IT! I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE!

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.966
AAH!
DADDY!

00:18:27.966 --> 00:18:30.235
NO!

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.006
[PANTING]

00:18:39.544 --> 00:18:41.513
I DID IT.

00:18:41.513 --> 00:18:44.516
I WAS ABLE
TO CONTROL MY POWER.

00:18:44.516 --> 00:18:46.017
AKIZA.

00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:48.620
UH...

00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:53.691
DADDY.

00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:55.727
I'M SORRY.

00:18:57.062 --> 00:18:59.064
HMM.

00:18:59.064 --> 00:19:00.698
HMM!

00:19:05.203 --> 00:19:07.739
YUSEI, PLEASE.
FINISH THIS.

00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:09.874
END THIS DUEL.

00:19:09.874 --> 00:19:12.544
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

00:19:12.544 --> 00:19:16.147
I'M DOING THIS
ONLY 'CAUSE YOU
ASKED ME TO, AKIZA.

00:19:16.147 --> 00:19:18.616
NOW IF MY DRAGON
CAN'T DESTROY
YOUR MONSTER,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:21.619
THE SYNCHRO RING
TRAP CARD DOUBLES
ITS ATTACK POINTS

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:25.356
AND GIVES IT
THE ABILITY
TO ATTACK AGAIN.

00:19:34.866 --> 00:19:37.402
THE CURSE OF
THE BLACK ROSE ENDS NOW!

00:19:37.402 --> 00:19:42.607
STARDUST DRAGON,
TAKE OUT AKIZA'S BEAST
WITH COSMIC FLARE!

00:20:03.895 --> 00:20:07.365
AKIZA, PLEASE,
WAKE UP.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.368
DADDY?

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.906
I MISSED YOU.

00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:17.876
I AM SO SORRY, AKIZA.

00:20:17.876 --> 00:20:20.411
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
BEEN AFRAID OF YOU.

00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:23.381
I SHOULD'VE REALIZED
THAT YOU WERE JUST
AS FRIGHTENED.

00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:26.384
I SHOULD HAVE HELD YOU
AND COMFORTED YOU,
BUT I DIDN'T.

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:28.853
LET ME START MAKING UP
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.923
THANK YOU, DAD,
BUT YOU SURE
YOU WANT ME HOME?

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:34.392
I MEAN, I...

00:20:34.392 --> 00:20:36.828
I WAS VERY MEAN.

00:20:36.828 --> 00:20:39.397
I HURT YOU AND MOM
AND EVERYONE ELSE
I EVER KNEW...

00:20:39.397 --> 00:20:41.299
Yusei: AKIZA.

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:45.003
LISTEN,

00:20:45.003 --> 00:20:48.039
YOU AND YOUR PARENTS
HAVE A LOT OF
CATCHING UP TO DO.

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.309
BUT WE SIGNERS
COULD REALLY USE YOU
AROUND, TOO.

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:53.278
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:20:53.278 --> 00:20:54.746
WILL YOU FIGHT
WITH US?

00:20:54.746 --> 00:20:58.316
WILL YOU TAKE
A STAND ALONGSIDE
YOUR FRIENDS?

00:20:58.316 --> 00:21:00.852
YOU GOT IT, YUSEI...

00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:03.388
IF THAT'S OK.

00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:06.357
OF COURSE.

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.994
YAY!
AWESOME.

00:21:09.994 --> 00:21:11.262
SEE, AKIZA?

00:21:11.262 --> 00:21:12.730
IT'S JUST LIKE
YUSEI SAID.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.766
WE'RE ALL BOUND
BY OUR MARKS!

00:21:14.766 --> 00:21:17.902
E-EXCEPT MINE HASN'T
APPEARED YET.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.805
IT'S TRUE.

00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:22.774
THESE MARKS CONNECT US.

00:21:22.774 --> 00:21:25.810
ALL OF US.
WE SHARE A DESTINY.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.479
SO, LIKE IT OR NOT,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

00:21:34.352 --> 00:21:37.822
THAT'S SWEET,
BUT I'VE HAD FRIENDS BEFORE,

00:21:37.822 --> 00:21:40.358
AND THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT
SO WELL FOR THEM.

00:21:41.626 --> 00:21:47.332
I MEAN, LOSING PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT REALLY HURTS.

00:21:47.332 --> 00:21:50.335
YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU MEAN, AKIZA.

00:21:50.335 --> 00:21:53.404
I RAN INTO AN OLD FRIEND
THE OTHER DAY AND, WELL,

00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:55.773
LET'S JUST SAY
HE'S CHANGED.

00:21:58.042 --> 00:22:00.612
WE ALL LOSE PEOPLE
IN DIFFERENT WAYS,

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:02.046
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:03.548
WE JUST HAVE
TO KEEP GOING.

00:22:03.548 --> 00:22:06.317
I KNOW
IT'S SCARY TO TRUST
NEW PEOPLE, BUT,

00:22:06.317 --> 00:22:07.785
AKIZA,
I'M ASKING YOU

00:22:07.785 --> 00:22:10.788
TO TRUST ME,
TO CALL ME A FRIEND.

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.957
I'LL TRY.

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:16.394
HMM.

00:22:16.394 --> 00:22:17.862
[THINKING]
I KNOW THAT TOGETHER,

00:22:17.862 --> 00:22:22.100
WE CAN DEFEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS
AND SAVE OUR HOMES!
