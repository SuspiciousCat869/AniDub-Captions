I CAN REMOVE
RED NOVA DRAGON FROM PLAY

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:50.890

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:54.860
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.829
[ELECTRONIC NOISES]

00:19:56.829 --> 00:20:00.833
WHEN GRANEL ATTACKS, IT CAN
NEGATE THE SPECIAL ABILITY

00:20:00.833 --> 00:20:03.536
OF A SYNCHRO MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:04.637
IT WHAT?

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:10.309
GO FINAL BOMBARDMENT.

00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.381
[EXPLOSIONS]
[ROARING]

00:20:15.381 --> 00:20:18.484
RED NOVA DRAGON.NOOO...!

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.391
JACK!

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.492
OH NO.

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.493
OH MY.

00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:28.728
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.565
AND NOW, GRANEL ATTACK'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.067
AND IT ABSORBS
THE SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.603
THAT WAS JUST DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:42.541

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:49.849
AND WITH THAT, MEKLORD EMPEROR
GRANEL NOW GAINS ATTACK POINTS

00:20:49.849 --> 00:20:51.951
EQUAL TO THE
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:54.220
OF YOUR RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:20:56.956 --> 00:21:00.359
WHERE'S YOUR CONFIDENCE NOW,
JACK ATLAS?

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:02.595

Luna: YOU'RE UP, CROW

00:21:10.603 --> 00:21:12.037
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:15.775
IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY TO
DEFEAT THAT THING?

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:19.645
