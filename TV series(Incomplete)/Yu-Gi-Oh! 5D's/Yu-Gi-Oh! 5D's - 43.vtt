WEBVTT

00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:03.422
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's"

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:06.258
Goodwin: I'VE WAITED A LONG
TIME FOR THIS MOMENT:

00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:09.028
THE FOUR SIGNERS
ALL TOGETHER!

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.065
OHH!
OH!
LOOK!

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:15.134
Yusei: WHAT IS IT?!
Goodwin: THIS, MY FRIENDS,

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:18.070
IS THE STAIRWAY
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.338
WHAT'S THAT SHAPE?

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:21.140
IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL OF OUR SIGNS!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.808
IT IS THE SYMBOL
THAT BINDS YOU ALL

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:25.845
AND DEFINES YOU AS SIGNERS:
PROTECTORS OF OUR WORLD!

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.580
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
SENSED THE STRENGTH

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.049
IN YOUR HEARTS AND CHOSE
THE FOUR OF YOU TO TAKE ON

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:31.650
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.453
ALL OF NEW DOMINO
CITY HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD,

00:00:34.453 --> 00:00:37.256
EVERY INNOCENT PERSON
A POTENTIAL VICTIM.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.258
AND OUR CITY IS
JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.560
IF WE FAIL TO DEFEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.096
TO STOP THE ARMY
OF SHADOWS FROM AWAKENING,

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.099
THE SOULS OF THE PLANET
WILL FALL INTO DARKNESS.

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.134
YOU MUST EACH
MAKE YOUR CHOICE.

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:51.036
AFTER TODAY THERE IS
NO TURNING BACK.

00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:54.740
GOODWIN, WE WANNA KNOW
EV'RYTHING ABOUT ALL
OF THESE DARK SIGNERS!

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.675
YOU DON'T.

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:58.577
THEY HAVE NEVER LOST,
UNLIKE THOSE PAWNS

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:01.447
YOU FACED
IN THE PARKING GARAGE
AND HOSPITAL.

00:01:01.447 --> 00:01:03.249
THE TASK THAT'S
BEFORE US JUST MIGHT BE

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.917
IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER WIN.

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:05.918
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:07.953
WE'VE LOST BEFORE
THE FIRST DRAW?!

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:09.989
I'M NOT SAYING
THERE'S NO HOPE AT ALL.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:12.391
YOU MUST FACE ALL
OF THEM TOGETHER.

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:14.593
BUT, EVEN IF WE DO
BEAT THEM,

00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:17.129
I CAN'T PROMISE
WE'LL ALL BE STANDING
HERE AGAIN.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:19.899
I HOPE THE FOUR OF YOU
CAN LOOK INTO YOUR HEARTS

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.601
AND MAKE THE DECISION
THAT OUR WORLD NEEDS.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.703
BUT BE QUICK,
I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE

00:01:24.703 --> 00:01:26.639
MUCH TIME LEFT.

Crow, thinking:

WHERE ALL
THE DARK SIGNERS ASSEMBLE.

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.718
I BETTER GO GET
MY DUEL RUNNER.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:48.053
AND, LIKE, PEOPLE
WERE TRAPPED

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:49.521
IN THIS FREAKY WALL
OF PURPLE MIST.

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:50.823
AND THEN THEY
ALL TURNED

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.691
INTO THIS GIGANTIC
MONSTER, RIGHT?

00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:55.127
YEAH. I SAW THAT
HAPPEN, TOO!

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:57.096
BAH! IT HAD TO'VE BEEN
A TRICK, FELLAS,

00:02:57.096 --> 00:03:00.199
LIKE ONE O' THOSE
OCTUPAL ILLUSIONS.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.101
STOP WHINING LIKE
A BUNCHA' KURIBOH'S.

00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:04.269
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.772
Crow: YOU SHOULD BE
WORRIED ABOUT IT!

00:03:06.772 --> 00:03:08.807
OH, YEAH!?
AND WHO'RE YOU?

00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:11.410
WHO'M I? NOBODY.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.245
JUST THE GUY WHO'S
TOTALLY GONNA SAVE

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:15.547
YOUR SORRY SATELLITE BUTTS.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.418
DON'T GO NEAR THAT HOLE
IN THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT!

00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:21.553
IT'S TOO SCARY!

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:23.255
YOU GUYS MIGHT WANNA
FIND YOUR OWN HOLE

00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:25.624
TO HIDE IN FOR A WHILE.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.829
'CAUSE THINGS ARE
ABOUT TO GET REALLY CRAZY.

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:47.274
[THINKING]
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:51.545
MY OLD FRIEND IS ONE
OF THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:55.516
YUSEI, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT

00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:57.485
KALIN, PLEASE
YOU HAVE TO STOP

00:03:57.485 --> 00:03:59.720
WHAT YOUR PLANNING TO
DO TO THE SATELLITE.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.555
YOU WERE ONCE OUR FRIEND.

00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:06.494
ONCE YOUR FRIEND YES
BUT NOW YOUR ENEMY!

00:04:09.296 --> 00:04:11.132
OH, KALIN.

00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:15.069
UM, YUSEI.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.406
Akiza: I, UH, WOULDN'T
BOTHER HIM RIGHT NOW.

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:20.841
HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HIM, AKIZA?

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.143
HAS HE BEEN OUT
THERE ALL MORNING?

00:04:22.143 --> 00:04:24.378
YEAH, I THINK THAT HE'S
STILL TRYING TO COME

00:04:24.378 --> 00:04:26.614
TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT
THAT HIS BEST FRIEND

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.649
ALMOST SENT HIM
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:31.318
IT MUST BE TEARING HIM UP
THAT ONE OF HIS OLD
CHILDHOOD BUDDIES

00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:35.523
FROM THE SATELLITE JUMPED
THE FENCE N' BECAME ONE
OF THOSE DARK SIGNER'S.

00:04:35.523 --> 00:04:37.892
THAT MUST BE
ROUGH FOR HIM.

00:04:37.892 --> 00:04:39.460
IT'S ROUGH
ON ALL OF US.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.928
SO, ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

00:04:40.928 --> 00:04:43.130
ABOUT FIGHTING
THIS ARMY OF SHADOWS?

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.765
NO WAY, I'M IN THIS.

00:04:44.765 --> 00:04:47.768
THE THING IS,
I'VE GOT SOMEONE
I'M TRYING TO HELP.

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:51.272
AND I THINK FIGHTING
THE DARK SIGNERS IS
THE WAY TO DO IT.

00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:52.840
[THINKING]
SHE'S SO YOUNG TO
BE CAUGHT UP

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.975
IN ALL OF THIS.

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:58.512
HEY, YUSEI, WANNA HAVE
A PRACTICE DUEL?

00:04:58.512 --> 00:04:59.880
NOT RIGHT NOW.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.416
I NEED SOME TIME
ALONE, LUNA.

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:03.584
OH.

00:05:07.154 --> 00:05:11.492
OH, ALRIGHT,
MAYBE LATER THEN.

00:05:11.492 --> 00:05:13.394
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:16.263
HMM.

00:05:21.035 --> 00:05:23.170
HOW ARE PREPARATIONS
ON YOUR END?

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.239
EVERYTHING IS
GOING SWIMMINGLY.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.007
HEE HEE HEE!

00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:38.552
[THINKING]
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES ANYMORE.

00:05:38.552 --> 00:05:40.955
THE OTHERS NEED YOU
TO BE STRONG, YUSEI.

00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:43.290
JACK.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.259
I KNOW THAT HE'S
A DARK SIGNER NOW,

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.429
BUT KALIN USED TO BE
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS.

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:50.264
WE USED TO THROW
DOWN TOGETHER

00:05:50.264 --> 00:05:52.867
AND PLAY KING
OF THE DECK
AND ALL THAT.

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.335
NOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO CALL HIM

00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:57.104
THE BAD GUY
AND GO AT HIM?

00:05:57.104 --> 00:06:00.574
I MAY'VE BEEN
THE ONE WHO MADE HIM
A DARK SIGNER.

00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:02.576
I DON'T KNOW IF I
CAN DO THIS, JACK.

00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:05.112
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE, YUSEI!

00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:07.114
THAT ISN'T HOW IT WORKS!

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.316
UGH!

00:06:09.316 --> 00:06:11.118
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

00:06:15.623 --> 00:06:16.657
[THINKING]
THIS GARDEN IS

00:06:16.657 --> 00:06:20.928
SO BEAUTIFUL AND PEACEFUL.

00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:23.898
I JUST WANT TO WALK
AROUND HERE FOREVER.

00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:30.404
I WISH I COULD SHARE
THIS WITH MY FAMILY.

00:06:32.206 --> 00:06:34.775
DO YOU REALLY
HAVE TO DO THIS?

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:35.943
I DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE.

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:38.012
THIS IS
MY DESTINY, MOM.

00:06:38.012 --> 00:06:40.714
BESIDES, IF I DON'T
HELP YUSEI FIGHT
THE DARK SIGNERS,

00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:42.216
WE'RE ALL
IN TROUBLE.

00:06:42.216 --> 00:06:43.384
SHE'S RIGHT.

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:44.819
BUT IT SOUNDS SO
HORRIBLE AND SCARY

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.021
AND DANGEROUS, AKIZA,
AND, YOU KNOW, WE... WE'VE

00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:49.757
FINALLY GOT A CHANCE
TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN.

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:51.659
THERE'LL BE
PLENTY OF TIME
TO BE A FAMILY

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.594
AFTER I BRING
DOWN THE BAD GUYS.

00:06:53.594 --> 00:06:55.229
I HAVE TO DO
THIS, MOM.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.232
I OWE IT TO
EVERYBODY I EVER
PUSHED AWAY.

00:06:58.232 --> 00:06:59.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:02.570
I'VE LET MY POWERS
GET THE BEST OF ME
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.806
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
I HURT A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:07.274
THAT'S ALL OVER
NOW, SWEETIE.

00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:09.276
YOU'RE NOT THAT
PERSON ANYMORE.

00:07:09.276 --> 00:07:11.278
RIGHT, BUT NOW I
HAVE A CHANCE TO USE

00:07:11.278 --> 00:07:12.746
MY POWERS FOR GOOD.

00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:14.215
THE DARK SIGNERS
ARE THREATENING

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:16.550
TO DESTROY
THIS ENTIRE CITY.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.285
IF I WANT TO
STOP THEM FROM
DOING THAT,

00:07:18.285 --> 00:07:19.954
THEN I
GOTTA STEP UP.

00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:21.555
LET SOMEONE
ELSE STEP UP!

00:07:21.555 --> 00:07:23.991
AKIZA, WHAT IF
YOU'RE NOT READY YET?

00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:25.626
WHAT IF YOU STILL
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FULLY

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.161
CONTROL YOUR POWERS?

00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:29.196
YOU COULD END UP
DESTROYING YOURSELF.

00:07:29.196 --> 00:07:30.998
WHAT?
I'LL BE OKAY.

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:33.167
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:36.370
YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.072
WELL, I CERTAINLY
WISH THINGS COULD BE

00:07:38.072 --> 00:07:40.541
DIFFERENT, BUT AT LEAST
YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS.

00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.310
YOU'LL HAVE YUSEI
AND THE OTHERS WITH YOU.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.712
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:47.081
DARLING, OUR GIRL HAS
SPENT HER WHOLE LIFE

00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:49.583
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE SHE BELONGS.

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:51.285
SHE FINALLY KNOWS.

00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:55.122
AND WHO ARE WE TO
HOLD HER BACK?

00:07:55.122 --> 00:07:57.558
[THINKING]
THANK YOU, DAD.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.431
Leo: OH, MAN!
LOOK AT THIS SPREAD!

00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.467
SAVING THE WORLD
HAS ITS PERKS!

00:08:06.467 --> 00:08:09.803
I'LL TAKE THIS
AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS.

00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:11.672
LEO! WE ATE
BREAKFAST
AN HOUR AGO!

00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:13.340
YOU GOTTA TRY THESE
LITTLE SANDWICHES.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.575
THEY'RE AMAZING!

00:08:14.575 --> 00:08:17.645
AAARGH, COULD YOU
BE SERIOUS FOR ONE
SECOND, LEO?

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.748
UH, I'M SERIOUS ABOUT
NOT LETTING THIS FOOD
GO TO WASTE.

00:08:20.748 --> 00:08:22.349
THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:24.518
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO MESS AROUND
AND SLACK OFF.

00:08:24.518 --> 00:08:26.020
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT GOODWIN SAID?

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.588
IT WILL TAKE
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT

00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:29.290
TO STOP
THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.893
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GONNA
BE REALLY INTENSE.

00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:35.562
OH, OKAY, SO WHILE
EVERYONE FREAKS OUT,

00:08:35.562 --> 00:08:37.231
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
RELAX AND EAT

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:38.232
AND CHILL
'ROUND HERE?

00:08:38.232 --> 00:08:39.300
PRETTY MUCH.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.301
IT'S A TOUGH JOB,
I KNOW,

00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:42.803
BUT SOMEONE'S
GOTTA DO IT.

00:08:42.803 --> 00:08:44.772
I CANNOT
BELIEVE YOU.

00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:47.374
I'M THINKING OF HITTING
THE ROOFTOP POOL LATER,

00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.376
YOU SHOULD COME,
THERE'S A VOLLEYBALL NET!

00:08:49.376 --> 00:08:51.145
A VOLLEYBALL NET?!

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:52.279
THIS TRIP TO
THE SATELLITE SECTOR

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.447
ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:54.548
YOU SHOULD BE
PREPARING,

00:08:54.548 --> 00:08:56.417
NOT PLAYING GAMES.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.152
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU.

00:08:58.152 --> 00:08:59.653
HUH?

00:08:59.653 --> 00:09:01.021
WHY SHOULD I GO?

00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.257
I'M NOT A SIGNER.

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:07.761
YEAH, BUT... DON'T
YOU WANNA COME?

00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:10.264
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE PART WAYS.

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:30.152
NOT SURE WHEN YUSEI'S
PLANNING ON BRINGING THE FIGHT.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:31.820
DOESN'T MEAN I GOTTA
WAIT AROUND.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.522
THERE'S NO REASON
I CAN'T GO ON AHEAD

00:09:33.522 --> 00:09:36.491
N' START BUSTING SOME
DARK SIGNER SKULLS.

00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:40.562
CROW'S HOUSE OF KICK-BUTT IS
OFFICIALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

00:09:40.562 --> 00:09:43.265
HUH? N' HERE COMES
OUR FIRST CUSTOMER.

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:47.169
THAT CREEPY LITTLE DUDE
HAS DARK SIGNER WRITTEN
ALL OVER HIM.

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:48.337
HEH.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.507
HEY, DARK SIGNER!
HUH?

00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:53.575
UNH!

00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:56.578
GOTCHA!

00:09:56.578 --> 00:09:57.746
HUH?

00:09:59.614 --> 00:10:01.350
OKAY, THAT'S WEIRD.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.518
I COULDA SWORN
I HAD HIM.

00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:05.053
HA HA HA!

00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.488
I'M AFRAID THAT ONLY
THE CAT CAN PLAY

00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:08.991
CAT-AND-MOUSE,
LITTLE RAT.

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:10.258
HEY!

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.665
GET BACK HERE!

00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:22.204
I KNOW YOU'RE
IN HERE.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:25.474
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:27.809
HA HA HA!
HUH?

00:10:30.012 --> 00:10:33.215
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD
THAT IT'S DANGEROUS
AROUND HERE?

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.483
THERE YOU ARE!

00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:36.385
NOW STOP
PLAYIN' GAMES!

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:38.020
YOU SHOULD TURN
AROUND RIGHT NOW,

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.688
AND SCAMPER ON HOME.

00:10:39.688 --> 00:10:41.857
HA, HA! SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONE

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.525
WHO'S SCARED,
DARK SIGNER!

00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:44.793
OH, MY.

00:10:44.793 --> 00:10:47.262
IT SEEMS WE'VE SOME SORT
OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

00:10:47.262 --> 00:10:49.498
YOU SEE, BECAUSE OF THAT
UNAPPEALING MARK

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:52.000
ON YOUR FACE, AND BECAUSE
YOU WERE SKULKING ABOUT,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.469
I THOUGHT PERHAPS THAT
YOU WERE A DARK SIGNER.

00:10:54.469 --> 00:10:55.804
ME?!

00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:59.408
OH, I SEE.

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.176
IT SAYS HERE THAT
YOU'RE OLD FRIENDS

00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:02.778
WITH YUSEI AND JACK ATLAS.

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:03.845
WHAT?

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:05.714
HA HA HA!

00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:07.249
OKAY, I'LL BITE,
LET'S SAY YOU'RE

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:08.784
NOT A DARK SIGNER.

00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:11.219
THEN WHO ARE YOU?

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:12.721
PARDON MY MANNERS.

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:14.956
I SHOULD'VE PROPERLY
INTRODUCED MYSELF.

00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:16.758
MY NAME IS LAZAR,
AND I WORK

00:11:16.758 --> 00:11:18.226
FOR THE PUBLIC SECURITY
BUREAU,

00:11:18.226 --> 00:11:19.494
UNDER DIRECTOR GOODWIN.

00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:21.997
I'M SORT OF
HIS RIGHT HAND.

00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:23.765
WAIT, YOU WORK
FOR GOODWIN?

00:11:23.765 --> 00:11:25.333
I JUST SAID THAT!

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:27.869
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
IN OVER YOUR HEAD HERE.

00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:29.471
NOW, RUN ALONG.

00:11:32.407 --> 00:11:34.543
I'M SORRY,
WAS I NOT CLEAR?

00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:36.244
IF YOU REALLY WORK
FOR GOODWIN,

00:11:36.244 --> 00:11:38.780
THEN WHY ARE YOU
LURKING AROUND HERE?

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.115
WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH YUSEI?

00:11:40.115 --> 00:11:41.783
ARE HE AND HIS
CRIMSON BUDDIES
GETTING READY

00:11:41.783 --> 00:11:44.586
TO COME HERE
N' TAKE OUT
THE DARK SIGNERS?

00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:46.955
THOSE ARE
NEED-TO-KNOW QUESTIONS.

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:49.157
AND A WRETCHED LITTLE
SEWER RAT LIKE YOU

00:11:49.157 --> 00:11:51.159
DOESN'T NEED TO
KNOW THE ANSWERS.

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:52.627
YA' KNOW WHAT I
THINK, BUDDY?!

00:11:52.627 --> 00:11:54.196
I THINK YOU'RE
TRYIN' TO TRICK ME,

00:11:54.196 --> 00:11:56.598
YOU'RE A DARK SIGNER
AND I'M GOING
TO PROVE IT!

00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:58.033
OH, GOODNESS.

00:11:58.033 --> 00:11:59.501
WHY DO I ALWAYS
HAVE TO DEAL

00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.769
WITH THE DENSE ONES?

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:03.472
OKAY, LOOK... WHAT DO I
HAVE TO DO TO PROVE THAT

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:04.906
I'M NOT A DARK SIGNER?

00:12:04.906 --> 00:12:07.809
HUMPH! I'M NOT
FALLING FOR ANYMORE
O' YOUR TRICKS.

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:09.845
HOW 'BOUT I JUST DUEL
THE TRUTH OUTTA YOU!

00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:11.613
HEH HEH HEH.

00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:13.815
BRING IT ON!
BRING IT ON!

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:15.117
I'M GOIN' FIRST,
CREEP!

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:17.486
I DRAW!

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.121
I'M KICKIN' THIS
THING OFF BY SUMMONING

00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.457
BLACKWING BORA
THE SPEAR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:26.661
HMPH.

00:12:26.661 --> 00:12:28.497
SO ACCORDING
TO YOUR FILE HERE,

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.732
YOUR WHOLE DECK IS BUILT
AROUND BLACKWINGS.

00:12:30.732 --> 00:12:31.867
INTERESTING.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:34.836
AND I PLAN ON
KEEPING IT THAT WAY.

00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:38.373
SO I'M ALSO SUMMONING
GALE THE WHIRLWIND
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:41.109 --> 00:12:43.145
I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT
'CAUSE BORA THE SPEAR

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:45.780
LETS ME SUMMON
A SECOND BLACKWING
TO THE FIELD.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.849
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,
BIRDS OF A FEATHER

00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:50.619
FLOCKING TOGETHER
AND ALL THAT.

00:12:50.619 --> 00:12:53.622
NOW, I PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:55.056
MY, MY.

00:12:55.056 --> 00:12:58.026
YOU HAVE A MONSTER
AND A TUNER MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:12:58.026 --> 00:13:00.862
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON?

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:03.231
YUP! I'M
UNPREDICTABLE
LIKE THAT.

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:04.833
I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO END UP

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:07.369
REGRETTING
YOUR DECISION.

00:13:23.143 --> 00:13:25.479
[GROANING]

00:13:25.479 --> 00:13:26.947
WHY'D YOU PUNCH ME?

00:13:26.947 --> 00:13:28.248
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

00:13:28.248 --> 00:13:29.816
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE,
YOU DOLT,

00:13:29.816 --> 00:13:32.152
I'M TRYING TO KNOCK
SOME SENSE INTO YOU!

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:33.253
UNH!

00:13:33.253 --> 00:13:35.489
[GROANING]

00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:39.760
LOOK AT YOU, YUSEI!

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.361
YOU LOOK LIKE SOME
SAD LITTLE PUPPY

00:13:41.361 --> 00:13:42.829
THAT'S BEEN LEFT
AT THE PARK.

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:44.965
NO WONDER YOU LOST
TO KALIN WHEN YOU
DUELED HIM.

00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:47.701
I'M GONNA SHARE
A SECRET WITH YOU,
OLD CHUM.

00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.269
I CAN'T STAND YOU.

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:51.471
YOU WIPED THE FLOOR
WITH ME IN THE TOURNAMENT,

00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:53.206
YOU STOLE MY TITLE.

00:13:53.206 --> 00:13:55.943
YOU WERE ABLE TO DO SO
'CAUSE YOU HAD NO FEAR.

00:13:55.943 --> 00:13:57.911
YOU WERE SURE OF YOURSELF.

00:13:57.911 --> 00:13:59.947
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THAT GUY, YUSEI?

00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:03.116
WHERE DID THAT
MAN RUN OFF TO ANYWAY?

00:14:03.116 --> 00:14:04.851
I KNOW KALIN
WAS OUR FRIEND.

00:14:04.851 --> 00:14:06.720
BUT THAT WAS THEN,
AND THIS IS NOW,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.190
AND YES,
ITS THAT SIMPLE.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.493
BUT I BETRAYED HIM.

00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:15.662
YOU DIDN'T BETRAY HIM,
HE BETRAYED YOU,

00:14:15.662 --> 00:14:17.597
HE BETRAYED ALL
OF US, REMEMBER?

00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:19.833
NOW PULL YOURSELF
TOGETHER, MAN!

00:14:22.035 --> 00:14:24.004
LEO.

00:14:24.004 --> 00:14:25.906
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
ABOUT PARTING WAYS

00:14:25.906 --> 00:14:29.309
AND NOT COMING TO
SATELLITE WITH ME.

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:31.511
COME ON WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL, LUNA?

00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.581
YOU DON'T WANT ME THERE,
I'M THE COMIC RELIEF,

00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:35.782
I'M THE GUY THAT SNEEZES
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

00:14:35.782 --> 00:14:37.384
TO SNEAK UP ON SOMEONE.

00:14:37.384 --> 00:14:40.087
I'M NOT A BIG HERO
LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:42.022
I'M JUST A CLOWN.

00:14:42.022 --> 00:14:43.590
I THOUGHT I MIGHT
HAVE IT IN ME,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.161
BUT WHEN I DUELED SAYER,
I REALIZED I GOT NOTHIN'.

00:14:48.161 --> 00:14:49.863
WHATEVER HEROES
ARE MADE OF,

00:14:49.863 --> 00:14:51.098
I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME.

00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:55.102
OH. LEO.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.104
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,
BUT I USED TO THINK

00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:59.306
YOU WERE HOLDING
ME BACK, LUNA.

00:14:59.306 --> 00:15:01.641
YOU WERE ALWAYS SICK
AND I HAD TO LOOK AFTER YOU.

00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.877
AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
WANTING TO STAY INSIDE.

00:15:03.877 --> 00:15:06.079
AND SO I HAD TO
STAY IN, TOO.

00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:07.381
I NEVER GOT TO
PRACTICE DUELING

00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:08.648
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

00:15:08.648 --> 00:15:09.950
SO I COULDN'T GET
ANY BETTER,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.086
AND I BLAMED YOU
FOR THAT.

00:15:13.086 --> 00:15:14.988
I KNOW, LEO.
HUH?

00:15:14.988 --> 00:15:16.356
I KNOW I HELD
YOU BACK.

00:15:16.356 --> 00:15:17.824
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU RESENT ME.

00:15:17.824 --> 00:15:19.526
I GUESS NOW'S AS GOOD
A TIME AS ANY,

00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:20.560
SO HERE GOES.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.163
LEO, I AM REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY...

00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:24.564
NO, THAT'S JUST IT!

00:15:24.564 --> 00:15:26.333
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO APOLOGIZE, LUNA,

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.468
BECAUSE, LIKE,
I GET IT NOW.

00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:29.836
YOU'RE AWESOME, LUNA!

00:15:29.836 --> 00:15:31.538
YOU HAVE SPECIAL POWERS!

00:15:31.538 --> 00:15:32.873
YOU'RE A SIGNER
AND YOU'RE TOTALLY GONNA

00:15:32.873 --> 00:15:34.241
SAVE THE WORLD!

00:15:34.241 --> 00:15:36.743
DON'T YOU GET IT?
HUH?

00:15:36.743 --> 00:15:39.546
IT'S NOT YOU WHO'S
THE BURDEN, IT'S ME.

00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:41.581
IF I GO WITH YOU GUYS,
I'LL JUST END UP

00:15:41.615 --> 00:15:42.983
BEING IN THE WAY.

00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:46.820
OR STANDING
ON THE SIDE LIKE A DORK,
GOING... HOORAY! YEAH!

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.321
GO, LUNA!

00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:51.758
SHOW THOSE DARK SIGNERS
HOW TO DUEL, YOU GO!

00:15:51.758 --> 00:15:53.326
YEEEAH!

00:15:53.326 --> 00:15:54.961
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT
IS PRETTY LAME,

00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:56.963
BUT DON'T YOU
GET IT?

00:15:56.963 --> 00:15:58.432
I'M REALLY SCARED, LEO,

00:15:58.432 --> 00:16:00.867
MORE THAN
I'VE EVER BEEN.

00:16:00.867 --> 00:16:03.070
I WANT YOU
THERE STANDING
ON THE SIDELINES

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.371
AND SHOUTING
LIKE A DORK.

00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:07.074
HUH? YA' DO?

00:16:07.074 --> 00:16:09.142
I DON'T CARE IF
YOU'RE NOT A SIGNER.

00:16:09.142 --> 00:16:14.815
YOU'RE MY BROTHER,
AND THAT... THAT MAKES
YOU MY HERO.

00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:17.517
I CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT YOU.

00:16:19.719 --> 00:16:21.154
HEY, JACK.

00:16:21.154 --> 00:16:22.556
WHAT IS IT?

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:25.025
YOUR WORDS HIT HARDER
THAN YOUR PUNCHES DO.

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.359
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT KALIN,

00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:27.828
AND YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT ME.

00:16:27.828 --> 00:16:30.330
I LOST MY FOCUS
AND MY CONFIDENCE.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.932
I KNOW THAT TO BEAT
THESE DARK SIGNERS

00:16:31.932 --> 00:16:35.969
AND PROTECT MY FRIENDS
I CAN'T HANG ON
TO ANY DOUBTS.

00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:38.205
EXACTLY.
FORGET KALIN.

00:16:38.205 --> 00:16:41.608
THINK ABOUT RALLY
AND CROW AND EVERYONE ELSE.

00:16:45.612 --> 00:16:47.280
[THINKING]
AND SO WILL I.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.682
DON'T WORRY, CARLY.

00:16:48.682 --> 00:16:52.018
WHEREVER YOU ARE,
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU.

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.130
Akiza: FEELING ANY BETTER?

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.331
YUP!

00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:07.067
THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE I
WAS STARTING TO WORRY.

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.768
WE CAN'T SAVE THE WORLD
FROM IMMINENT DOOM

00:17:08.768 --> 00:17:10.303
WITHOUT YOU, YA' KNOW.

00:17:10.303 --> 00:17:11.872
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:17:11.872 --> 00:17:14.307
SAME GOES
FOR YOU, AKIZA.

00:17:14.307 --> 00:17:15.742
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

00:17:15.742 --> 00:17:17.978
Luna: YUSEI!

00:17:17.978 --> 00:17:19.980
HEY, LUNA.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.515
YOU'RE COMING, RIGHT?

00:17:21.515 --> 00:17:22.983
YOU BET.

00:17:22.983 --> 00:17:24.918
WHAT ABOUT LEO?

00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:33.460
HEY, YOU GUYS!

00:17:35.595 --> 00:17:37.531
ARE YOU READY
FOR THIS?

00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:39.566
I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH
YOU TAKE THOSE
DARK SIGNERS DOWN,

00:17:39.566 --> 00:17:41.201
IT'S GONNA BE SO
TOTALLY AWESOME,

00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:42.869
YOU'RE THE BEST!

00:17:42.869 --> 00:17:44.137
THANKS.

00:17:44.137 --> 00:17:45.939
YOU'RE AWESOME, TOO,
JACK, EVEN THOUGH

00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.807
YOU'RE NOT
THE BEST ANYMORE.

00:17:47.807 --> 00:17:49.976
JUST CAUSE I LOST
DOESN'T MEAN I'M
NOT THE BEST.

00:17:49.976 --> 00:17:52.946
DON'T WORRY,
I STILL LOOK UP
TO YOU AND EVERYTHING.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:53.947
LOOK, YOU!

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:54.981
I'M ALWAYS GOING
TO BE THE BEST,

00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:56.416
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND ME?

00:17:56.416 --> 00:17:59.686
OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY,
YUSEI'S THE BEST NOW.

00:17:59.686 --> 00:18:01.788
TECHNICALLY NOTHING,
YOU WORM, I'M THE BEST!

00:18:01.788 --> 00:18:03.023
YOU LOST
THE CHAMPIONSHIP,

00:18:03.023 --> 00:18:05.125
THAT MAKES
YOU NUMBER TWO!

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.893
IT'S MY TURN.

00:18:06.893 --> 00:18:09.696
I DRAW!

00:18:09.696 --> 00:18:12.832
AND I PLACE THREE CARDS
FACEDOWN AND WITH THAT,

00:18:12.832 --> 00:18:14.534
I END MY TURN.

00:18:14.534 --> 00:18:17.204
REALLY? YOU MEAN,
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GONNA DO?

00:18:17.204 --> 00:18:19.606
DID YOU NOT HAVE
ANY MONSTERS
IN YOUR HAND?

00:18:19.606 --> 00:18:23.276
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.
HEH HEH HEH.

00:18:23.276 --> 00:18:25.679
NOW I BELIEVE IT'S
YOUR TURN, CROW.

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.847
YOU TRYING TO MAKE
THIS EASY FOR ME?

00:18:27.847 --> 00:18:29.749
I DRAW!

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:32.586
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT YOU'RE HOPING
I'LL START ATTACKING,

00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:35.121
HENCE THOSE THREE
FACEDOWN CARDS.

00:18:35.121 --> 00:18:38.158
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:18:38.158 --> 00:18:40.493
HECK... I DON'T WANNA
DISAPPOINT YOU, SO...

00:18:40.493 --> 00:18:45.098
BLACKWING BORA
THE SPEAR,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:18:45.098 --> 00:18:48.201
IN THAT CASE, I ACTIVATE
MY IMPERIAL MANNERS TRAP.

00:18:48.201 --> 00:18:50.103
I'M ABLE TO PUT THIS
TRAP'S PERKS TO USE

00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:52.038
WHEN YOUR MONSTER
DECLARES AN ATTACK,

00:18:52.038 --> 00:18:54.541
AND AS LONG AS I HAVE
NO MONSTERS ON MY FIELD,

00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:56.309
THEN I CAN DESTROY
EVERY MONSTER

00:18:56.309 --> 00:18:58.578
ON YOUR FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:18:58.612 --> 00:19:00.113
YOU CAN WHAT?

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:03.583
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME!

00:19:03.617 --> 00:19:06.753
WELL, THEN I ACTIVATE
THE URGENT TUNING TRAP!

00:19:06.753 --> 00:19:09.022
[THINKING]
I WANTED TO SAVE THIS
BADBOY FOR LATER,

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.790
BUT ACTIVATING IT NOW IS
THE ONLY WAY I CAN STOP

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.927
HIM FROM DESTROYING
BOTH OF MY MONSTERS.

00:19:13.927 --> 00:19:15.228
A-HA!

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:16.263
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T
SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:19:16.263 --> 00:19:17.564
DURING YOUR FIRST TURN,

00:19:17.564 --> 00:19:19.299
YOU WERE TRYING
T' HOLD OUT.

00:19:19.299 --> 00:19:22.302
HOWEVER I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE WASTED
YOUR SURPRISE.

00:19:22.302 --> 00:19:24.170
HERE'S FACEDOWN
NUMBER TWO!

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.338
THE DISCORD TRAP.

00:19:25.338 --> 00:19:26.840
THIS CARD'S PRESENCE
ON THE FIELD MEANS

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.775
THAT NEITHER ONE OF US
CAN SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:30.243
NO EXCEPTIONS,
I'M AFRAID.

00:19:30.243 --> 00:19:32.045
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:33.813
YOU CANNOT STOP
IMPERIAL MANNERS,

00:19:33.813 --> 00:19:36.783
SO SAY BYE-BYE
TO YOUR MONSTERS!

00:19:39.152 --> 00:19:41.688
YUSEI SAID YOU
DARK SIGNERS
WERE SNEAKY,

00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:43.456
AND BOY
WAS HE RIGHT!

00:19:43.456 --> 00:19:46.760
I ALREADY TOLD YOU...
I'M NOT A DARK SIGNER,

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.963
MY NAME IS LAZAR,
AND I WORK FOR
MISTER GOODWIN.

00:19:49.963 --> 00:19:52.032
RIGHT! IF YOU EXPECT
ME TO BELIEVE THAT

00:19:52.032 --> 00:19:54.601
AND WALK AWAY,
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER
THING COMIN'!

00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.569
I'M PLACING
ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:19:56.569 --> 00:19:58.138
YOUR MOVE,
DARK SIGNER!

00:19:58.138 --> 00:19:59.406
I DON'T GET IT.

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:01.241
WHY DID A BLATHERING
BUFFOON LIKE YOU

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.143
HONESTLY THINK HE COULD
COME HERE AND TAKE ON

00:20:03.143 --> 00:20:05.812
THE POWER
OF THE DARK SIGNERS
ALL BY HIMSELF?

00:20:05.812 --> 00:20:06.846
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

00:20:06.846 --> 00:20:08.014
YOU'RE
THE BLATHERING
BUFFOON,

00:20:08.014 --> 00:20:09.382
YOU BLATHERING
BUFFOON.

00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:11.685
I CAN TAKE ALL YOU
DARK SIGNERS ON!

00:20:11.685 --> 00:20:12.952
JUST STOP TALKING.

00:20:12.952 --> 00:20:14.854
BELIEVE ME, EVERY TIME
YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,

00:20:14.854 --> 00:20:16.456
YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF.

00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:19.125
THEN TELL YA' WHAT...
LET'S STOP TALKING
AND KEEP DUELING.

00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:20.794
I MEAN IT, I'M DONE
TALKING TO YOU,

00:20:20.794 --> 00:20:24.597
NO MORE TALKING,
I'M GONNA STOP TALKING
RIGHT NOW, NO MORE TALK.

00:20:24.597 --> 00:20:28.335
HEH HEH HEH!
THERE'S SOMETHING
LIKABLY AMUSING ABOUT YOU.

00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:32.339
LOOK, I'M SIMPLY
TRYING TO SAVE YOU
FROM HUMILIATION.

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:35.108
BUT IF YOU WISH,
I DRAW!

00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:39.679
AND NOW, I SHALL SUMMON
JESTER LORD TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:20:41.815 --> 00:20:44.284
HA HA HA!

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:47.053
Computer: JESTER LORD IS
A LEVEL ONE DARK ATTRIBUTE

00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:49.255
SPELL CASTER
WITH ZERO ATTACK POINTS

00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:51.825
AND ZERO DEFENSE POINTS.

00:20:51.825 --> 00:20:54.494
EH!? THAT'S
A MONSTER?

00:20:54.494 --> 00:20:57.597
A MONSTER THAT'S GOING
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.265
HEE HEE HEE!

00:20:59.265 --> 00:21:01.868
YOU KNOW THAT THING
HAS NO ATTACK POINTS,
RIGHT?

00:21:01.868 --> 00:21:03.737
WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

00:21:03.737 --> 00:21:05.305
JUST ONE THING.

00:21:05.305 --> 00:21:07.173
WHEN JESTER LORD
IS THE ONLY MONSTER

00:21:07.173 --> 00:21:09.976
ON THE FIELD,
IT GAINS 1000 ATTACK POINTS

00:21:09.976 --> 00:21:12.946
FOR EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD THAT
IS ON THE FIELD.

00:21:12.946 --> 00:21:14.280
IT DOES WHAT?!

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.216
CURRENTLY, THERE ARE
THREE SPELL AND TRAP CARDS

00:21:16.216 --> 00:21:17.584
ON THE FIELD.

00:21:17.584 --> 00:21:21.888
THEREFORE, JESTER LORD'S
ATTACK POINTS ARE 3000.

00:21:21.888 --> 00:21:24.591
WOAH. THAT'S
A LOT A POINTS,
NOT TOO BAD.

00:21:24.624 --> 00:21:26.826
BUT DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA SIT HERE
AND TAKE IT.

00:21:26.826 --> 00:21:29.562
I'M ACTIVATING MY
DUST TORNADO TRAP CARD!

00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:33.433
WITH THIS HUMDINGER,
I CAN DEMOLISH YOUR
DISCORD TRAP!

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:35.168
[THINKING]
BY GETTING RID
OF TWO TRAP CARDS,

00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:38.471
I CAN LOWER JESTER'S
ATTACK POINTS
TO A THOUSAND.

00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:40.907
I'LL STILL TAKE DAMAGE,
BUT WITH THAT DISCORD
TRAP GONE,

00:21:40.907 --> 00:21:43.643
I'LL BE ABLE TO
SYNCHRO SUMMON
ON MY NEXT TURN.

00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:45.745
BEFORE YOU GET AHEAD
OF YOURSELF,

00:21:45.745 --> 00:21:49.516
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO ACTIVATE
THE IMPERIAL CUSTOM TRAP CARD,

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:51.518
WHICH SAVES ALL
CONTINUOUS TRAPS

00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:53.520
ON MY FIELD
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.588
SO, IT LOOKS LIKE MY
JESTER WILL ONLY BE

00:21:55.622 --> 00:21:57.424
LOSING ONE THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS?!

00:21:57.424 --> 00:21:58.925
HUH!?

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:01.694
NOW JESTER LORD,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY.

00:22:01.694 --> 00:22:02.996
HEEE!

00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:07.600
HEH HEH HEH.

00:22:07.634 --> 00:22:09.235
I ADMIT,
THAT WAS GOOD.

00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:10.670
BUT I CAME HERE
TO HELP YUSEI TAKE

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.205
YOU DARK SIGNERS OUT,

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:13.273
SO DON'T THINK
FOR A SECOND

00:22:13.273 --> 00:22:14.874
THAT I'M EVEN CLOSE
TO BACKING DOWN.

00:22:14.874 --> 00:22:17.510
IF YOU'RE SO CONVINCED
THAT I'M A DARK SIGNER,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.180
WHY DON'T YOU PUSH ME
TO MY LIMITS BY FORCING ME

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.482
INTO A CORNER WHERE
I'LL HAVE TO RELY

00:22:22.482 --> 00:22:24.117
ON MY DARK
AND MYSTERIOUS POWERS?

00:22:24.117 --> 00:22:26.319
HEH! FUNNY YOU
SHOULD SAY
THAT, PAL,

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:28.254
CAUSE THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT
I'M ABOUT TO DO.

00:22:28.254 --> 00:22:30.156
SO GET READY TO
COME FACE-TO-FACE

00:22:30.156 --> 00:22:31.424
WITH YOUR
BREAKING POINT.
