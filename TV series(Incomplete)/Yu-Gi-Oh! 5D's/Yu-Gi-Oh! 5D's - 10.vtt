WEBVTT

00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:03.643
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:03.643 --> 00:00:05.378
GET IN THERE.

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:08.448
DON'T EXPECT A MINT
ON YOUR PILLOW.

00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:10.650
SAY, UH,
IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
TROUBLE,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.486
TAKE THE TOP BUNK,
WOULD YA?

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:13.820
NO ARGUMENTS, NICE!

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.258
YOU LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON?

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:19.493
YES, EVERYWHERE!

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:22.162
WELL, THEN, PERHAPS WE
NEED TO CHALLENGE YUSEI

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.563
TO A DUEL OF SOME SORT.

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:26.099
I'LL TAKE THAT PIECE
OF GARBAGE ON RIGHT NOW!

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.768
YOU MUST ARRANGE
A SITUATION

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:30.203
WHERE THAT SATELLITE
WILL WANT TO DUEL.

00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:33.206
I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO!

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:35.709
HERE'S THE REAL REASON
I WANTED THE BOTTOM BUNK.

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:41.448
I FOUND SMUGGLED MAGAZINES
IN TANNER'S CELL!

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:43.116
YOU ALL KNOW THAT'S
AGAINST THE RULES.

00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:45.652
THERE ARE NO MAGAZINES,
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:47.988
SO I'M JUST PUNISHING TANNER
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT?

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:50.791
YOU'RE ABUSING
YOUR AUTHORITY,
ARMSTRONG.

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.392
TO PROVE THAT
I'M A REASONABLE MAN,

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:53.493
I'LL LET YOU DUEL ME
OUT HERE

00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:55.095
WHERE YOUR FELLOW INMATES
CAN WATCH,

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:57.631
AND IF YOU WIN, I'LL
PARDON TANNER'S OFFENSE.

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:00.100
BUT IF I HAPPEN
TO WIN THE DUEL...

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.836
THEN NO ONE HERE BUT ME
GETS PUT IN LOCKDOWN.

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:04.971
HURRY UP AND PREPARE
THE DUEL DISKS!

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:09.075
WHAT'S THIS CHAIN ALL ABOUT?

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.243
OH, THAT'S....

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:11.845
JUST TO MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE FUN.

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:13.880
EVERY TIME YOU TAKE
LIFE POINT DAMAGE,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.982
THAT CHAIN'LL SORTA
GIVE YOU A LITTLE TICKLE.

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:17.551
WHAT KIND OF
LITTLE TICKLE?

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:19.085
YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:20.120
LET'S GO!
LET'S GO!

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.955

00:01:21.955 --> 00:01:26.059

PHANTOM INTO THE FLOOR!

BRACE YOURSELF, SATELLITE.

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:30.430

A LITTLE SHOCKING.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.902
FROM WINNING THIS DUEL,

00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:44.204
I'M NOT TAKING MY EYES
OFF THE PRIZE.

I'M GLAD
TO SEE THIS DUEL

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:56.750
ISN'T TOO SHOCKING
FOR YOU, SATELLITE.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.685
WELL, THAT'S EASY FOR ARMSTRONG
TO SAY,

00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:03.523
ESPECIALLY SINCE HIS
DUEL DISK ISN'T CONNECTED
TO THE STATIC GENERATOR.

00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:05.692
IT'S MY TURN!

00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:08.061
AND I THINK I'LL START BY
PLAYING THE SPELL CARD

00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:10.096

00:03:12.132 --> 00:03:15.502
DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU'RE ALREADY
BEHIND BARS???

00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:17.604
YEAH, WELL THESE BARS
ARE GONNA KEEP ME SAFE

00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:20.840
FROM YOUR STATIC
GENERATOR'S SHOCKS
FOR THE NEXT TWO ROUNDS.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.743
THAT LITTLE
CAGE WON'T SAVE YOU!

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:25.045
WE'LL SEE.

00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:27.180
NOW I LAY DOWN
A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.549
STEELCAGE!
THAT WAS MY CARD!

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.051
SEE? I TOLD YOU
MY DECK WASN'T LAME.

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:34.354
LISTEN! I SAID THAT
YOU WERE LAME, NOT
YOUR STINKIN' DECK!

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:37.290
SHUT IT YOU TWO,
YOU'RE BOTH LAME!

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.358
HMM.

00:03:38.358 --> 00:03:40.427
NOW, YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE SAFE

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:43.930
WITH THAT STEELCAGE
STOPPING MY MONSTERS
FROM ATTACKING YOU,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.666
BUT I DON'T NEED TO
ATTACK IN ORDER
TO WIN THIS DUEL,

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:49.769
N'HERE'S WHY YUSEI:

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.405
FIRST
I'LL PLAY IRON CHAIN SNAKE.

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:54.975
AND SINCE I HAVE
IRON CHAIN REPAIRMAN

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:56.376
ALREADY ON THE FIELD,

00:03:56.376 --> 00:03:59.679
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY LETS ME
BRING OUT ANOTHER MONSTER.

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.183
SO I THINK I'LL BRING OUT
ANOTHER IRON CHAIN SNAKE!

00:04:03.183 --> 00:04:07.420
NEXT UP, I'M ACTIVATING
THESE TWO SPELL CARDS!

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.855
AND WITH THEM IN PLAY,

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:10.457
THIS MATCH
IS ALL BUT A LOCK FOR ME

00:04:10.457 --> 00:04:13.526
BECAUSE WITH 2 LEVEL 5 CHAIN
MONSTERS ON MY FIELD,

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:16.997
MY POISON CHAIN
NOW FORCES YOU TO SEND 10
CARDS TO YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:19.032
IF MY MONSTERS DON'T ATTACK.

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:21.701
AND WHEN YOUR DECK RUNS OUT OF
CARDS TO PLAY, SATELLITE,

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:25.105
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS,
DON'T YOU?

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:26.506
I LOSE.

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:27.907
NOW, I HOPE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING PLANNED

00:04:27.907 --> 00:04:29.943
FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF YEARS, YUSEI,

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.511
'CAUSE ONCE I
WIN THIS DUEL,

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:35.715
YOU CAN WAVE BYE-BYE
TO YOUR FUTURE.

[GRUNT]

00:04:40.186 --> 00:04:44.691
SO WITH THOSE 10 CARDS GONE,
YOU'VE ONLY GOT 19 LEFT.

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:46.593
AT THIS RATE,
YUSEI WON'T SURVIVE

00:04:46.593 --> 00:04:48.161
FOR MORE THAN
TWO MORE ROUNDS!

00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:05.015
COME ON, GRANDPA,

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:06.684
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING YUSEI CAN DO

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:08.452
TO STOP
ARMSTRONG'S SPELL!

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:10.221
THERE IS, BUT I DON'T
THINK THE GUARDS

00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:12.990
ARE GONNA LET HIM RUN
AWAY AND HIDE.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.893
NOW I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
PARALYZING CHAIN,

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:18.129
WHICH SHOCKS AWAY
300 LIFE POINTS

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.531
WHENEVER YOU SUFFER
THE EFFECTS
OF MY POISON CHAIN.

ITS ALMOST TIME. SORRY I
CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

00:05:30.608 --> 00:05:33.077
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, YUSEI.

00:05:37.314 --> 00:05:41.018
LOOKS LIKE THAT CAGE
ISN'T SO SAFE
AFTER ALL, HUH, YUSEI?

00:05:41.018 --> 00:05:42.720
GUESS THOSE CARDS
ARE AS USELESS

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.955
AS THE PEOPLE WHO
GAVE THEM TO YOU!

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:46.957
I'LL SHOW YOU USELESS.

00:05:46.957 --> 00:05:48.893
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

00:05:48.893 --> 00:05:50.494
IF YOU CAN LAST!

00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:56.700
THAT'S MY SIGNAL.

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.139
MAYBE YUSEI WAS RIGHT ABOUT NOT
LEAVING HIS FRIENDS HERE.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:03.707
HMM.

00:06:03.707 --> 00:06:06.243
LOOK. LET'S...
LET'S JUST ESCAPE,
THE TWO OF US.

00:06:06.243 --> 00:06:09.013

ARE DEAD WEIGHT IN
THEIR CURRENT STATE.

FOR MY OWN BENEFIT.

IF IT'S A TRAP OR A SPELL,

00:06:46.317 --> 00:06:49.153
NOT ONLY DO YOU LOSE IT,

00:08:56.113 --> 00:09:00.250
THEIR ATTACKS AREN'T
GOING TO SHOCK YOU
INTO SUBMISSION!

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.920
HA HA HA!

00:09:02.953 --> 00:09:05.189
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
YOUR TIME BEHIND BARS
BACKFIRED.

00:09:05.189 --> 00:09:07.691
I MEAN, ALL YOU HAVE LEFT
ARE A HALF-DOZEN CARDS

00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:10.394
IN THAT JOKE
YOU CALL A DECK.

00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:14.365
THESE CARDS ARE
THE HEART AND HOPE
OF EVERY MAN IN HERE!

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:16.200
THEN I'LL BE SURE
TO DESTROY THEM,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.135
AS SOON
AS I'M DONE WITH YOU!

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:20.504
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:21.572
HUH?

00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:22.673
[MURMURING]

00:09:22.673 --> 00:09:26.577
SOMEBODY
TURN ON THE LIGHTS!

00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:27.911
WHAT WAS THAT?!

00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:29.313
WE'RE NOT SURE, SIR.

00:09:29.313 --> 00:09:32.416
BUT WE'RE CHECKING THE GENERATOR
CONTROL ROOM NOW.

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:34.685
LET'S GET BACK
TO BUSINESS.

00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:36.420
[THINKING]
ALEX! HE'S GONE!

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.288
THAT BLACKOUT MUST
HAVE BEEN CAUSED

00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:40.190
BY HIS FRIENDS
ON THE OUTSIDE!

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.625
WISH I WAS WITH YOU,

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:43.494
BUT I GOT MY FRIENDS
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:09:43.494 --> 00:09:45.162
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

00:09:45.162 --> 00:09:50.401
OK, CHIEF, I'M PLAYING
THIS: THE TRAP CARD
THE JAR OF GREED!

00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.902
AND THANKS TO IT,
ARMSTRONG,

00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:53.570
I DRAW ONE MORE CARD.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.973
HA! WITH EACH CARD
THAT YOU REMOVE
FROM YOUR DECK,

00:09:55.973 --> 00:09:59.043
YOU'RE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO LOSING THIS DUEL!

00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:03.313
NOT IF I PLAY MY TRAP
CALL OF THE HAUNTED.

00:10:03.313 --> 00:10:04.982
Computer: CALL OF THE HAUNTED
IS A TRAP CARD

00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:07.851
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO
SPECIAL SUMMON A MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:10.854
BACK ONTO YOUR FIELD
IN ATTACK POSITION.

00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:13.223
AND GUESS WHO
I'M BRINGING BACK
WITH IT, ARMSTRONG?!

00:10:13.223 --> 00:10:15.859
YOU SHOULD GET A BIG
KICK OUT OF THIS.

00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:17.394
YOU BROUGHT BACK
KICK MAN?!

00:10:17.394 --> 00:10:19.363
HE'S AS VALUABLE
AS YOU ARE!

00:10:19.363 --> 00:10:21.965
YOU SHOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE THE
POWER OF ANY CARD,

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:25.602
ESPECIALLY ONE THAT
CAN JOIN FORCES WITH
A CARD IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:10:25.602 --> 00:10:27.304
BUT YOUR GRAVEYARD
IS FULL OF...

00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:29.473
CARDS YOU FORCED ME
TO GET RID OF.

00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:32.810
SO IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR
STRATEGY IS THE ONE
THAT BACKFIRED,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.345
BECAUSE NOW I CAN
CALL ON AXE OF DESPAIR

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:38.582
TO GIVE MY KICK MAN
AN EXTRA 1,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:39.917
HEH HEH HEH!

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.186
NICE ONE! COURSE,
I DID THE SAME COMBO

00:10:42.186 --> 00:10:44.154
BACK IN MY PRO DAYS
ON THE CIRCUIT.

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:49.026
AND NEXT UP,
I'M SUMMONING
EXILED FORCE!

00:10:49.026 --> 00:10:52.362
KICK MAN, ATTTTAAAACK!

00:10:57.434 --> 00:11:00.137
OW! AAH!

00:11:00.137 --> 00:11:02.840
HOLD ON! HIS DUEL DISK
FIN'LY SHOCKED HIM!

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.444
YEAH! LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE TURNED THE POWER
BACK ON!

00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:09.480
NOW, EXILED FORCE,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.081
MOVE IN AND SLAY
THAT SERPENT OF HIS

00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:12.416
WITH A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.084
HOLD ON!
TIME OUT!

00:11:14.084 --> 00:11:17.955
WAIT! THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH MY... NOOOOOO!

00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:20.591
[SHOUTING]

00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:21.959
IF I FIND OUT
THAT THE PERSON

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:24.895
WHO TURNED MY DUEL DISK
BACK ON KNOWS YOU, YUSEI,

00:11:24.895 --> 00:11:27.865
THEY'RE GONNA
WISH THEY NEVER MET YOU!

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:29.967
UNH!

00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:47.403
Guard: CHIEF ARMSTRONG,

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:48.637
AN INTRUDER HAS BEEN CAUGHT
AND RESTRAINED

00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:49.905
IN THE POWER GENERATOR ROOM.

00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:51.974
WE'RE BRINGING HIM TO YOU A-SAP.

00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:54.877
[GRUNTING]

00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:56.979
NOW LET'S SEE WHO DID THIS!

00:11:59.248 --> 00:12:00.983
[SPUTTERING]

00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:02.685
SIR,
HERE'S THE CULPRIT!

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:04.887
THIS WAS YUSEI'S
CELLMATE!

00:12:04.887 --> 00:12:07.957
NO! THEY CAUGHT ALEX!

00:12:07.957 --> 00:12:10.392
[GASPING]

00:12:10.392 --> 00:12:13.696
HOW DID THIS PUNK
SNEAK OUT OF HIS CELL?!

00:12:13.696 --> 00:12:15.764
SIR, HE DUG A HOLE,
GOT TO THE POWER ROOM,

00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:17.032
AND FRIED
THE MAINFRAME.

00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:18.901
HE DID WHAT?

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:20.035
GO FIX IT!

00:12:20.035 --> 00:12:21.904
MY DUEL DISK
HAS BEEN SHOCKING ME!

00:12:21.904 --> 00:12:24.640
EXACTLY. AND IT'S NOT
GOING TO STOP.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.242
AH! I SAID FIX IT!

00:12:27.242 --> 00:12:28.310
I'M SORRY, SIR,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.778
BUT THE MAINFRAME
CAN'T BE REPAIRED,

00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:31.780
WHICH MEANS THE SHOCKS
THAT ARE RUNNING
THROUGH YOUR DUEL DISK

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.450
WILL CONTINUE FOR
THE REMAINDER OF
THE CONTEST.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.952
[GROWLING]

00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:38.687
SOON AS I'M DONE HERE,
PUNK,

00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:41.657
YOU AND I WILL HAVE
A NICE LONG "CONVERSATION!"

00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:43.158
BUT FIRST: YOUR DUEL.

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:45.027
AND WITH THE PLAYING FIELD
EVENED UP,

00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:46.695
I'D BE SHOCKED TO
SEE YOU WIN.

00:12:46.695 --> 00:12:47.896
[GROWLING]

00:12:47.896 --> 00:12:49.431
WHY'D YOU COME BACK,
ALEX?!

00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:51.767
WELL, I COULDN'T
JUST LEAVE YOU HERE.

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:53.602
I HAD TO TRY
AND HELP YOU, YUSEI.

00:12:53.602 --> 00:12:55.771
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO
FOR EACH OTHER.

00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:58.273
JUST LIKE YOU PUT
YOUR FRIENDS
AHEAD OF YOURSELF,

00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:00.142
I WANTED TO DO
THE SAME FOR YOU!

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:01.477
HMM.

00:13:01.477 --> 00:13:03.512
IT'S TIME WE ADD
TO THE STAKES.

00:13:03.512 --> 00:13:05.981
NOW THAT
YOUR DUEL DISK IS
"WORKING" ONCE AGAIN,

00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:09.351
I SAY WE
BATTLE IT OUT FOR ALEX.

00:13:09.351 --> 00:13:11.086
I WIN,
YOU DON'T PUNISH HIM.

00:13:11.086 --> 00:13:13.922
I LOSE, AND HE GOES
INTO LOCKDOWN LIKE ME.

00:13:13.922 --> 00:13:15.924
UM, YUSEI?

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:17.359
SOUNDS PERFECT!

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:18.794
YOU'RE DONE NEXT TURN,
ANYWAY!

00:13:18.794 --> 00:13:22.498
LET ALEX WATCH HIS FUTURE
DISAPPEAR!

00:13:22.498 --> 00:13:25.234
SO, THEN,
LET'S KEEP GOING.

00:13:25.234 --> 00:13:29.238
I SACRIFICE EXILED
FORCE TO DESTROY
IRON CHAIN REPAIRMAN!

00:13:33.108 --> 00:13:35.444
IT'S YOUR MOVE, CHIEF.

00:13:35.444 --> 00:13:37.546
THIS IS IT!
ONE DRAW!
ONE CARD!

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:39.014
AND IF IT'S A MONSTER,

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:41.016
YUSEI HAS TO THROW AWAY
ALL HIS CARDS!

00:13:41.016 --> 00:13:44.787
SO, UM, WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT THAT?

00:13:44.787 --> 00:13:47.389
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT
IS HE'LL LOSE!

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:48.957
DIDN'T YOU EVER
FIND A RULE BOOK

00:13:48.957 --> 00:13:50.526
WHEN YOU WERE
TRAVELING THE WORLD?!

00:13:50.526 --> 00:13:53.095
MAN, IT'S LIKE
TALKIN' ABOUT THIS
TO MY DAD!

00:13:53.095 --> 00:13:54.630
BUT YOU CALL ME GRAMPS!

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.031
NEVER MIND.

00:13:58.033 --> 00:14:00.702
HERE WE GOOOOO!

00:14:02.504 --> 00:14:05.174
WELL, WELL.
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE OK.

00:14:05.174 --> 00:14:07.609
AT LEAST FOR NOW,
YOU ARE.

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:09.011
[THINKING]
BUT WHAT YUSEI DOESN'T KNOW

00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.580
IS THAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING
EVERY MOVE OF HIS GAME

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.216
SINCE DRAW ONE.

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:18.287
THANKS TO
MY SECURITY CAMERAS,

00:14:18.287 --> 00:14:22.157
HIS CARDS ARE ABOUT AS SECRET
AS A PRIME-TIME LINE-UP.

00:14:22.157 --> 00:14:25.494
AND PREMIERING TONIGHT ARE
YUSEI'S FACEDOWN CARDS.

00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:26.595
AND I GOT A FEELING,

00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:29.198
IT'S GONNA
BE SOMETHING OF A TRAGEDY.

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:31.366
THE FACEDOWN
ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS TAUNT,

00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:33.836
A TRAP CARD
HE CAN'T EVEN USE THIS TURN!

00:14:33.836 --> 00:14:36.105
AND ON THE LEFT SIDE?
BATTLE MANIA.

00:14:36.105 --> 00:14:37.873
NOW, THAT TRAP
COULD BE TROUBLE,

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:40.509
SINCE IT FORCES
OUR MONSTERS TO
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:43.612
AND AS LONG AS YUSEI'S
KICK MAN IS SWINGIN'
THAT AXE OF DESPAIR,

00:14:43.612 --> 00:14:45.247
HE'S GOT THE UPPER HAND.

00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:47.850
BUT WITH BATTLE MANIA GONE,
I WIN,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.886
AND I'VE GOT
JUST THE CARD
TO GET RID OF IT!

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:52.287
I'LL THINK
I'LL MIX THINGS UP

00:14:52.287 --> 00:14:54.523
WITH MY SPELL CARD
RELOAD!

00:14:54.523 --> 00:14:56.892
NOW I'LL JUST PUT ALL MY CARDS
IN MY DECK,

00:14:56.892 --> 00:14:59.928
SHUFFLE 'EM UP,
AND REDRAW!

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:01.396
YAH!

00:15:02.731 --> 00:15:04.967
HEH HEH HEH!

00:15:04.967 --> 00:15:08.303
HA HA HA!

00:15:08.303 --> 00:15:10.639
I PLAY
MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHO!

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.174
Computer: MYSTICAL SPACE TYPHO

00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:14.376
IS A SPELL CARD THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO DESTROY

00:15:14.376 --> 00:15:18.614
ONE SPELL OR TRAP CARD
THAT YOU OR YOUR OPPONENT
HAS ON THE FIELD.

00:15:18.614 --> 00:15:22.618
AND NOW I CHOOSE
TO DESTROY THE FACEDOWN
CARD ON THE LEFT!

00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:23.952
SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:29.324
WHAT?!
IT'S NOT BATTLE MANIA?!

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.059
NO,
BUT THE RIGHT ONE IS!

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:33.228
CHECK IT OUT!

00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:35.931
SO NOW OUR MONSTERS
HAVE TO ATTACK.

00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:37.799
AND THAT MEANS
I DON'T LOSE
ANY MORE CARDS

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:39.868
IN THIS ROUND!

00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:41.103
HE DID IT!

00:15:41.103 --> 00:15:43.172
YUSEI MUST HAVE SWITCHED
ALL HIS CARDS AROUND

00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:45.073
WHEN THE BLACKOUT
HAPPENED!

00:15:45.073 --> 00:15:47.543
NOW YUSEI'S KICK MAN
CAN WIN THIS!

00:15:47.543 --> 00:15:49.311
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?!

00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:51.847
THIS DUEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE
FIXED SO THAT I WIN!

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:53.482
Man: DON'T WORRY, SIR.
WE'VE STACKED YOUR DECK

00:15:53.482 --> 00:15:56.051
WITH THE MOST ADVANCED CHAIN
MONSTER COMBOS AVAILABLE.

00:15:56.051 --> 00:15:58.754
YUSEI'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNOWS HOW TO DUEL WITH DRAGONS!

00:16:13.452 --> 00:16:14.520
[GRUNT]

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.855
[THINKING]
ALRIGHT, YUSEI,

00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:17.456
I DIDN'T GO THROUGH ALL
THE TROUBLE TO CHEAT

00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:18.757
JUST SO YOU
WOULD WIN!

00:16:18.757 --> 00:16:21.493
TIME TO SHOW YOU
THE REST OF MY CHAIN GANG!

00:16:21.493 --> 00:16:25.030
I SUMMON OUT
MY IRON CHAIN COIL!

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.867
[MOAN]

00:16:27.867 --> 00:16:31.704
AND I'LL TUNE HIM
WITH IRON CHAIN BLASTER
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON:

00:16:31.704 --> 00:16:33.739
IRON CHAIN DRAGON!

00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:36.175
HA HA HA!

00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:38.244
[ROARING]

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:42.281
HERE'S WHERE IT GETS FUN!

00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:45.150
SEE, FOR EVERY
CHAIN MONSTER THAT
I'VE GOT IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.686
MY DRAGON GAINS
200 ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:47.686 --> 00:16:50.756
AND RIGHT NOW,
I'VE GOT 5!

00:16:50.756 --> 00:16:53.792
SO WITH AN EXTRA
THOUSAND ATTACK POINTS, YUSEI,

00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:57.897
I'M ATTACKING YOU
WITH MY IRON CHAIN DRAGON!

00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:04.370
TRUST ME, CHIEF.
THAT'S A BAD IDEA.

00:17:04.403 --> 00:17:06.672
I KNOW IT IS!
FOR YOU!

00:17:06.672 --> 00:17:07.973
[ROAR]

00:17:09.508 --> 00:17:11.243
[YELLING]

00:17:13.612 --> 00:17:15.281
DID I FORGET TO MENTION

00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:18.417
THAT HIS SPECIAL ABILITY
AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATES?

00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:19.919
YA SEE,
WHENEVER HE ATTACKS,

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.955
YOU HAVE TO SEND

AND WITH PARALYZING
CHAIN'S EFFECT,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.362
YOU LOSE
300 MORE LIFE POINTS.

00:17:30.396 --> 00:17:31.830
[YELLING]

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:36.068
[GROANING]

00:17:38.137 --> 00:17:39.505
YUSEI, NO!

00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:40.572
HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:41.774
HE'S FINISHED!

00:17:41.774 --> 00:17:43.442
Man: HE CANT WIN NOW.
HE'S TOO WEAK.

00:17:43.442 --> 00:17:45.344
[INMATES MURMURING]

00:17:45.344 --> 00:17:46.445
[GRUNTING]

00:17:49.748 --> 00:17:51.517
MY TURN.

00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:59.425
OH! HA HA HA!

00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:02.361
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT!

00:18:02.394 --> 00:18:03.629
YOU'RE DOWN TO
100 LIFE POINTS

00:18:03.629 --> 00:18:05.030
AND YOUR VERY LAST CARD!

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.365
YOUR DECK'S EMPTY,

00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:08.867
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE A SINGLE FACEDOWN!

00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:10.069
I KNOW.

00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:13.439
BUT ALL I NEED TO WIN
IS ONE CARD...

00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:15.808
AND A LITTLE
OF YOUR HELP!

00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:17.209
MY HELP?!

00:18:17.209 --> 00:18:18.377
YOU SPENT THE WHOLE DUEL

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.313
TRYING TO SEND MY CARDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:21.313 --> 00:18:23.415
YOU THOUGHT
MY ENTIRE DECK
WAS WORTHLESS,

00:18:23.415 --> 00:18:25.551
JUST A MISH-MASH OF
CARDS GIVEN TO ME

00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:28.320
BY YOUR PRISONERS,
MY FRIENDS.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.556
AND MAYBE,
ON THEIR OWN,

00:18:30.556 --> 00:18:33.926
THEY WOULDN'T STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST YOUR
SUPERCHARGED CHAINS,

00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:36.462
BUT TOGETHER,
THEY WILL WITH THIS.

00:18:36.462 --> 00:18:37.596
HUH?

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:39.898
I KNEW YOU WOULD USE
THE SECURITY CAMERAS

00:18:39.898 --> 00:18:41.367
TO SPY ON THE CARDS
IN MY HAND

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.102
ONCE THE MATCH STARTED.

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:46.238
BUT I ALSO KNEW
YOU WOULDN'T SEE THIS.

00:18:46.238 --> 00:18:47.973
IT'S CALLED RUBBLE KING!

00:18:47.973 --> 00:18:49.842
I HID IT SO YOUR LITTLE
SURVEILLANCE FRIENDS

00:18:49.842 --> 00:18:52.311
COULDN'T
"BIG BROTHER" IT.

00:18:52.311 --> 00:18:54.947
SO AS SOON AS YOU
PICKED THE WRONG
TRAP CARD TO DESTROY,

00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:59.818
I JUST HAD TO KEEP YOU
SENDING MY CARDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:59.818 --> 00:19:01.086
[GROWLS]

00:19:01.086 --> 00:19:02.788
FOR WHAT? TO LOSE?!

00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:03.922
NOT QUITE.

00:19:03.922 --> 00:19:05.290
I'LL SHOW YOU
AFTER I SUMMON HIM.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.726
HAH!

00:19:07.726 --> 00:19:09.995
NOW, IF THERE ARE
OVER 30 CARDS
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:11.997
WHEN RUBBLE KING
IS SUMMONED,

00:19:11.997 --> 00:19:13.799
LIKE YOU SO THOUGHTFULLY
PROVIDED,

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.434
I GET TO USE A TRAP!

00:19:15.434 --> 00:19:18.337
IT COMES DOWN TO
MY VERY LAST CARD.

00:19:18.337 --> 00:19:21.373
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
BLASTING THE RUINS!

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:24.309
IF I HAVE 30 OR MORE
CARDS IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:25.711
WHICH YOU KNOW I DO,

00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:29.982
THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY
LOSE 3,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:19:29.982 --> 00:19:31.550
3 WHAT?!

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.651
[ROARING]

00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:39.191
AAH!

00:19:39.191 --> 00:19:40.959
[YELLING]

00:19:43.095 --> 00:19:44.096
UNH!

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:49.301
YOU BEAT 'IM, YUSEI!

00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:50.869
HE WON, HE WON!

00:19:50.869 --> 00:19:52.571
NEVER A DOUBT!

00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:53.906
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:19:53.906 --> 00:19:55.274
YOU SEE THAT?

00:19:55.274 --> 00:19:57.176
HE TOOK OUT THE CHIEF
WITH ALL OF OUR CARDS!

00:19:57.176 --> 00:19:58.610
[INMATES CHANTING "YUSEI!"]

00:20:08.187 --> 00:20:10.489
PUT 'EM BOTH
INTO LOCKDOWN.

00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:11.857
WHAT?!

00:20:11.857 --> 00:20:13.225
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR DEAL?!

00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:14.827
WE DON'T HAVE ANY DEAL!

00:20:14.827 --> 00:20:16.762
TAKE THEM BOTH AWAY NOW!

00:20:16.762 --> 00:20:20.065
Goodwin: I DON'T THINK SO,
MR. ARMSTRONG.

00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:22.568
I SAW THE ENTIRE DUEL.

00:20:22.568 --> 00:20:26.105
AND THE ONLY PERSON GOING AWAY
IS YOU, I'M AFRAID.

00:20:26.105 --> 00:20:28.841
I DON'T SEE HOW THE FACILITY
CAN BE RUN EFFECTIVELY

00:20:28.841 --> 00:20:32.044
IF NO TRUST EXISTS BETWEEN
THE GUARDS AND THE INMATES.

00:20:32.044 --> 00:20:35.481
PACK YOUR THINGS, ARMSTRONG,
YOU'RE FIRED.

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:49.261
SO WHAT NOW, YUSEI?

00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:50.529
YOU'RE FREE TO GO!

00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:51.797
SOMETHING'S WEIRD.

00:20:51.797 --> 00:20:53.699
WHY DID GOODWIN
SHOW UP JUST THEN?

00:20:53.699 --> 00:20:54.700
SEEMS FUNNY.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.934
OH, BE QUIET!

00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:57.069
THANKS TO GOODWIN,

00:20:57.069 --> 00:20:59.071
WE'RE ALL GETTING
OUT SOON, TOO!

00:20:59.071 --> 00:21:03.142
I KNOW, AND THAT'S WHY
THIS WHOLE SITUATION
JUST SEEMS STRANGE.

00:21:03.142 --> 00:21:05.978
YUSEI WINS, NOW WE'RE
ALL GONNA BE FREE?

00:21:05.978 --> 00:21:07.679
JUST BE SURE
TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:09.014
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

00:21:09.014 --> 00:21:13.185
SO, PLEASE,
TAKE THIS GIFT.

00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:14.520
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR CARD!

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.054
YES, YA CAN!

00:21:16.054 --> 00:21:18.590
I FIGURE YOU'LL
PROBABLY HAVE MORE
USE FOR THAT CARD

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.060
THAN I EVER WILL!

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.663
THIS IS INCR'DIBLE.
THANK YOU.

00:21:24.663 --> 00:21:27.032
HOLD ON!
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU AS WELL.

00:21:27.032 --> 00:21:29.001
THIS CARD'S GONNA HELP
YOU GET YOUR RUNNER BACK.

00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:31.570
I OVERHEARD THE GUARDS
TALKING ABOUT YOUR SWEET RIDE

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.772
AND HOW IT'S LOCKED UP
IN THE IMPOUND CENTER.

00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:36.542
NOW, TAKE THIS TO
A STORE NAMED BOOTLEG,

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.210
ORDER SOME MILK,
AND ASK FOR BLISTER.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.645
HE'LL HELP YOU OUT.

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:43.448
Lazar:
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:47.819
IF YOU LET HIM GO,
WE MIGHT NEVER
FIND HIM AGAIN!

00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:50.255
IT'S OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YUSEI'S
MARK OF THE DRAGON

00:21:50.255 --> 00:21:51.990
WON'T REAPPEAR
WHILE HE'S TRAPPED

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.426
INSIDE THE WALLS
OF THE FACILITY.

00:21:54.426 --> 00:21:57.329
IT'S TIME FOR
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

00:21:57.329 --> 00:22:00.966
BESIDES, I NEVER SAID
THAT WE WERE
LETTING HIM GO.

00:22:00.966 --> 00:22:02.601
YOU'RE GOING TO TRACK HIM?!

00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:06.538
OH, YOU ARE SO SNEAKY!
HEE HEE HEE!

00:22:06.538 --> 00:22:09.441
WITH YUSEI FREE TO ROAM
NEW DOMINO CITY,

00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:11.476
I HAVE SELECTED
AN ELITE TASK FORCE

00:22:11.476 --> 00:22:13.312
TO KEEP HIM
UNDER SURVEILLANCE

00:22:13.312 --> 00:22:16.815
AND WATCH FOR
ANY SIGNS OF HIS MARK
REAPPEARING.

00:22:16.815 --> 00:22:19.284
NOW, AS LONG
AS NO ONE INTERFERES
IN OUR AFFAIRS,

00:22:19.284 --> 00:22:23.121
ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS WATCH AND WAIT.

00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:27.025
HELLO AGAIN, YUSEI.

00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:28.660
[GRUNT]

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.098
I HEARD ABOUT
THE LITTLE TASK FORCE
GOODWIN PUT TOGETHER.

00:22:33.098 --> 00:22:36.068
YOU BETTER HOPE
THEY GET TO YOU BEFORE I DO
