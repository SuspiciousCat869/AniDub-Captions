WEBVTT

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.237
Rick: GENTLEMEN! MAY I PRESENT--

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.206
THE LATEST AND GREATEST
IN DUEL RUNNER MODIFICATIONS!

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:07.174
IS THAT IT!?

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.575
IS THAT OUR
ENGINE DESIGN?

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.310
Rick: IT IS, EXCEPT
THAT WE INCREASED

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.979
YOUR ENGINES ROTATION RADIUS,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.048
WHICH HELPED BOOST
THE ENER-D OUTPUT BY 150%.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:19.620
THIS IS OUR MASTERPIECE.
IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.356
WE'VE ALREADY INSTALLED THE OS
PROGRAM YOU GUYS DESIGNED

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.358
AND RAN A BATTERY OF TESTS.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.425
CHECK OUT THESE RESULTS.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.361
JUST LOOK AT THAT
ACCELERATION RATE.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.662
WHOA!

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:29.930
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK, BRUNO?

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:32.332
DOES THE REAL THING
MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS?

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.600
MM-HMM.

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.836
HOW WERE YOU GUYS ABLE
TO WORK ON THIS THING?

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:37.504
CONSIDERING YOUR
PRESIDENT NOW HAS

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.339
"CRIMINAL"
ON HIS RESUME...

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.475
OBVIOUSLY OUR COMPANY
IS IN THE MIDST

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.377
OF A LITTLE PR CRISIS
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.579
BUT INDUSTRIOUS MINDS
NEVER SLEEP!

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:49.149
AND OUR PRESIDENT
WANTED US TO BUILD
THIS INCREDIBLE ENGINE.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.051
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO YOUR PRESIDENT?

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.620
ARE THEY
GOING TO SHIP BOLTON
OFF TO THE SLAMMER?

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.723
I CAN'T DISCUSS THE PARTICULARS
AT THIS MOMENT.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.894
BUT I'M AFRAID WE WON'T
BE SEEING OUR PRESIDENT
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.098
THAT BEING SAID--
OUR PRESIDENT'S PASSION
FOR DUEL RUNNERS LIVES ON.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.867
AND IN HIS HONOR,
THIS COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.602
TO PURSUE AND DEVELOP
THE LATEST

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.939
IN CUTTING EDGE
DUEL RUNNER ENGINEERING.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:12.940
GOOD LUCK.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.474
THANKS FOR ALL
THAT YOU'VE DONE.

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.211
YOU'VE BROUGHT US
ONE STEP CLOSER TO
REALIZING OUR DREAM.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.052
Crow: THOSE DUEL RUNNERS...
ARE...AWESOME!

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.226
Leo: YUSEI!

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.028
AKIZA TOLD US THE NEW
DUEL RUNNERS ARE DONE.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.096
IS IT TRUE?!

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:38.832
FORGET THE RUNNERS,
CHECK OUT THESE THREADS!

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.001
CUSTOM-DESIGNED
AND HAND-CRAFTED

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:42.469
VINTAGE RIDING
OUTFITS...

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.572
BROUGHT TO YOU
BY YOURS TRULY.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.507
VERY NICE!
YOU GUYS
LOOK AWESOME!

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:49.076
Jack: I THINK
YOU LOOK ABSURD.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.545
YOU LOOK LESS
LIKE PRO-CIRCUIT
TURBO DUELISTS

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:54.114
AND MORE LIKE
A COUPLE OF
RODEO CLOWNS.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.549
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT, JACK?

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.551
I MODELED THESE OUTFITS
AFTER YOURS!

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.153
MY OUTFIT
IS BURSTING WITH
STYLE AND SUBSTANCE.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.489
YOU FAILED TO CAPTURE
THE MANY SUBTLE NUANCES

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:04.625
THAT GIVE IT
ITS TRUE FLAIR!

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:07.127
Luna: UM...5D'S?

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.730
IS THAT LIKE
THE TEAM NAME?
YEAH.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.298
IF YA' DON'T LIKE IT,
BLAME JACK.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:12.799
HE INSISTED ON 5D'S.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.836
OH RIGHT, BECAUSE
"THE SUPER RADICAL
FRIENDLY ALLIANCE TEAM"

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.638
WAS THE GREATEST
NAME EVER!

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.074
I THINK 5D'S SOUNDS KINDA COOL,
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.877
I WAS WONDERING THAT MYSELF,
BUT I THINK I GOT IT...

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:27.047
ONE D STANDS FOR DASHING...
ANOTHER FOR DANGEROUS...

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:29.483
THERE'S DARING, OF
COURSE..DESTRUCTIVE...

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.585
AND THE LAST ONE
IS, UUHUH...

00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:34.921
I'M AN ENGINE DESIGNER,
SO THAT MUST BE IT!

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.456
YOU FOOL.
5D'S IS ABOUT

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:38.659
ONE THING--THIS RIGHT HERE.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.428
SO YOU'RE NAMED AFTER...
OUR MARKS?

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.829
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.432
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED
BY THE MARK OF
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.401
THAT'S WHAT TIES US
ALL TOGETHER.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.169
I DON'T HAVE ONE OF
THOSE MARKS...

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.737
BUT HEY,
COME TO THINK OF IT,

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.439
YOUR MARK IS THE REASON
I MET EVERYONE.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.207
SO IN THAT SENSE I'M
CONNECTED THROUGH YOU.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.242
MM-HMM.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.177
THAT, AND YOU AND LUNA
COUNT AS ONE PERSON.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.578
Both: EH!?

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.881
WHAT ABOUT ME?
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ANY DRAGON!

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.616
HOW 'BOUT WE
NAME THE TEAM
BRUNO AND THE 5D'S,

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.851
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALREADY THE--

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.620
I THINK IT'S A REALLY
GREAT NAME.

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.855
IT'S PERFECT.
THANKS.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.357

Announcer: TEAM EXTREME
TO PRACTICE LANE 2.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.861
TEAM EXTREME TO PRACTICE LANE 2.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.563
Leo: SO, UH--WHAT ARE
WE LOOKING AT?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.998
Yusei: THE MAIN TOURNAMENT
CALL BOARD.

00:04:25.065 --> 00:04:27.134
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE ALREADY
DECIDED THE MATCHUPS

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.969
FOR THE PRELIMINARY ROUNDS.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.036
ISN'T IT SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:30.971
A BRACKET THING?

00:04:31.037 --> 00:04:32.239
THIS IS
FOR THE PRELIMS

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:33.673
AND THERE ARE
32 TEAMS...

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.142
SO--THEY'VE
DIVIDED
THOSE TEAMS

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.343
INTO 8
DIVISIONS.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.044
THE TOP TWO TEAMS
FROM EACH DIVISION

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.513
WILL GO ON TO DUEL
IN THE FINALS,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.848
AND THAT TAKES ON
THE TOURNAMENT
FORMAT.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.383
Luna: YOU MEAN
THE BRACKET THINGY.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.952
YEAH.
THE BRACKET THINGY.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.054
WITH ONLY
4 TEAMS COMPETING
IN EACH DIVISION,

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.656
AS LONG AS
WE WIN TWICE,

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.224
WE'LL BE HEADING
INTO THE FINALS.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.260
NICE, SO THEN...
WHO'S LUCKY ENOUGH

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:55.529
TO BE NUMBER ONE
ON OUR TO BEAT LIST?

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.031
Bruno: LOOKS LIKE...
TEAM UNICORN...

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.633
WHO IS TEAM UNICORN?

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.268
WE MET 'EM
AT THAT PARTY.

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.270
OH RIGHT,
I REMEMBER NOW!

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:05.405
THE GUY WITH THE FUNNY
POINTY HAIR.

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.373
YEAH!

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.208
THAT GUY WITH
THE FUNNY POINTY HAIR

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:09.342
LED HIS TEAM TO VICTORY

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.278
IN THE ATLANTIS TOURNAMENT
LAST YEAR.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.747
THEY'RE THE ODDS-ON FAVORITE
TO WIN THIS WHOLE THING.

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:16.516
Leo: [SIGH] WHY DID
THEY HAVE TO GO
AND PUT THE TOP TEAM

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:19.052
IN THE SAME PRELIMINARY
BLOCK AS US?

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.320
HMPH! THEY MAY BE

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:21.988
CONSIDERED THE BEST
RIGHT NOW....

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.491
BUT ONCE THE WORLD GETS
A TASTE OF TEAM 5D'S,

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:26.493
THINGS ARE GONNA
CHANGE REAL FAST!

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.296
BESIDES, IF TEAM UNICORN
IS REALLY THAT GOOD,

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.398
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DUEL
'EM SOONER OR LATER.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.134
YEAH, BUT IT WOULDA
BEEN NICE TO HAVE
AN EASY TEAM FIRST.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.503
EXACTLY, LIKE A WARM-UP
OR SOMETHING.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.737
SPEAKING OF WARM UPS--

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.207
OUR PRACTICE LANE
IS ABOUT TO OPEN UP.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.810
RIGHT! COME ON, YOU GUYS,
LET'S DO THIS.

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:45.812
YOU WANNA GO TO THE MALL
OR SEE A MOVIE?

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.347
AND MISS THE MAIDEN VOYAGE?

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.850
NO WAY, LET'S GO UP
AND WATCH FROM THE STANDS.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.184
Leo: YEAH!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.254
Announcer: TEAM 5D'S
TO PRACTICE LANE 2

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.856
FOR YOUR SCHEDULED PRACTICE RUN.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.757
TEAM EXTREME,
PLEASE CLEAR THE LANE.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:01.728
TEAM 5D'S TO PRACTICE LANE 2
FOR YOUR SCHEDULED PRACTICE RUN.

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:04.965
HUH? HEY, IS THAT
TRUDGE DOWN THERE?

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.736
Leo: HEY! TRUDGE!

00:06:09.803 --> 00:06:11.004
THE PEANUT GALLERY!

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:13.139
YOU GUYS
HANGING AROUND
TO ROOT FOR YUSEI?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.241
Luna: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.842
Leo: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, TRUDGE?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.410
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:19.312
LOOK FOR YOURSELF.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.448
ALL THOSE
DIFFERENT LANES
AND DIFFERENT TEAMS

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:22.983
COMING IN AND OUT
TO PRACTICE...

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.752
AND YOU CAN'T USE
AUTOPILOT IN THIS
TOURNAMENT...

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.520
THE WHOLE SITUATION
IS A RUNNER WRECK

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:28.722
JUST WAITING
TO HAPPEN...

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.090
WE DREW STRAWS
AT THE STATION

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:31.458
TO SEE WHO HAD
TO COME DOWN HERE

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:32.692
AND WAIT
FOR THE BIG BANG,

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.227
AND I DREW
THE SHORT STRAW,

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:36.563
SO HERE I AM,
DOING MY CIVIC DUTY.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.131
OH.
BUMMER, MAN.

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:40.634
CHECK IT OUT--THE BOYS
HAVE BEEN SET LOOSE.

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:48.575
All: YEAH!

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.878
All: YEAH!

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.183
THE GEAR SHIFT IS SMOOTH!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.386
THIS ACCELERATION
IS INCREDIBLE!

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:01.288
AND THE TORQUE IS GREAT.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.630
Crow, thinking:
PEARSON...BOLTON...

00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:12.632
WHO WOULDA THOUGHT THAT
WHEN WE BUILT THIS RUNNER

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.200
THAT ONE DAY, I'D BE HERE...

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.970
PEARSON...I'M GONNA
WIN THIS THING.

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.339
FOR YOU.
FOR OUR DREAMS.

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:20.907
ALRIGHT!
WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:23.243
WE PUSH THESE NEW
BAD BOYS TO THE EDGE?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.511
Jack and Yusei: YEAH!

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.731
WELL, THE GUYS SEEM TO
BE ENJOYING THEMSELVES.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.300
YEAH--WE COMPLETELY REVAMPED
THEIR ENGINES, SO...

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:50.737
THEIR DUEL RUNNERS ARE WORKING
ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.872
OOOH...
THEN I LOOK FORWARD

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.607
TO DUELING THEM AGAIN.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.343
WAIT, "DUELING THEM AGAIN?"

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:57.677
Trudge: OH, WOULDYA LOOK
AT THE TIME!

00:07:57.744 --> 00:07:59.212
BOY, I GOTTA
GET GOING!...

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.747
THERE'S ROUNDS TO MAKE,

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:02.615
AND PARKING GARAGES
TO PATROL,

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.651
AND TICKETS TO WRITE UP,
AND DOUGHNUTS TO--

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:07.187
Bruno: HANG ON, TRUDGE, WHAT DID
YOU MEAN "DUELING THEM AGAIN?"

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.822
ARE YOU DUELING
IN THE TOURNAMENT?

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:11.257
[CHUCKLES] ALRIGHT,
GUYS, SEE YA' LATER!

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.492
STAY SAFE!

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.170
Announcer: TOWER TO 5D'S...
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES REMAINING.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.139
DID YOU COPY THAT, GUYS?
OUR TIME IS UP.

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:28.441
LET'S PULL OFF WHEN
WE GET TO THE EXIT RAMP.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.810
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
WE'VE GOT TWO MINUTES.

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:32.479
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO BURN ANOTHER LAP

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.480
WITH THESE NEW ENGINES!

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.581
AH, COME ON, CROW!

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.816
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP HIM ON A LEASH.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:43.356
OH MAN, I AM LOVING
THE WAY THIS BABY FLIES!

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:50.597
LOOK OUT!
[STRUGGLING]

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:58.238
Leo: DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
Luna: WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.041
Bruno: LOOKS LIKE
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT
ON ONE OF THE LANES.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.544
HEY!...

00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:10.016
BREO!
HEY, ARE YOU HURT?

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.052
DON'T WORRY, ANDRE.
I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.353
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M HERE!

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.754
EVERYONE CALM DOWN,
GIVE HIM AIR,

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.755
HOW'S HE DOING?

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:17.424
WHY DID YOU HIT HIM,
YOU FOOL?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.259
IT WASN'T
ON PURPOSE, GUY.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.527
I COULDN'T STOP.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.762
YOU TRIED TO INJURE
MY TEAMMATE!

00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:23.763
STOP IT!

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.932
HE SAID IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT, MATE.

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.267
"AN ACCIDENT,"
YOU SAY?

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.401
IT WAS OUR TURN
ON THE LANE.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:29.602
YOUR TIME WAS UP.

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:30.570
AND HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.038
OUT HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:09:32.105 --> 00:09:33.673
WE'LL SLAP HIS WRIST.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.475
LOOK--NOBODY GOT HURT...

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:36.976
AND MY FRIEND APOLOGIZED...

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.679
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.215
YOUR FRIEND TRIED
TO SABOTAGE MY TEAM,

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.283
THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT.

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:44.684
AND I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S THE WAY

00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.686
THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
WILL SEE IT, AS WELL.

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:48.354
WE ARE NOT CRYING TO
THE COMMITTEE, JEAN.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.590
UNICORNS HAVE MORE
INTEGRITY THAN THAT.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.825
WAIT, WHAT?

00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.794
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
OUR FACES ALREADY,
YUSEI FUDO?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.533
OH, YOU GUYS ARE...
TEAM UNICORN!...

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.169
I FEEL DUMB THAT
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:04.404
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:07.407
IT WAS
A BRIEF MEETING WITHOUT
PROPER INTRODUCTION.

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:10.777
I AM CALLED ANDRE.
THIS HERE IS JEAN.

00:10:10.844 --> 00:10:12.278
AND THIS IS BREO.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.613
HELLO.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.848
HMPH!

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:17.517
I REALLY AM SORRY.
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.352
NAH...I'M STILL
IN ONE PIECE, RIGHT?

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.856
YEAH. I...GUESS YOU
COULD SAY THAT...

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:24.657
CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR
YOUR DUEL RUNNER THOUGH.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.427
LOOK AT THAT THING.
THERE'S NO WAY
IT'LL RUN NOW.

00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.362
PERHAPS.
BUT WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:30.430
I'LL JUST USE
ANOTHER ONE.

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:31.297
C'EST LA VIE, DUDE.

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.665
HUH!?

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.201
Andre: WE'VE GOT A TON OF
SPONSORS FUNDING OUR TEAM.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:37.036
WE'VE GOT LIKE 10
OF THOSE EXACT SAME RUNNERS

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.204
BACK AT THE GARAGE.

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:39.672
Crow: STILL, LET ME PAY
FOR THE DAMAGES.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:41.274
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO.

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.577
JUDGING FROM YOUR CLOTHES,
I DOUBT YOU COULD PAY
FOR A NEW KICKSTAND.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.579
KNOCK IT OFF, JEAN.
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.949
[STRUGGLING] MUST CONTROL
URGE TO SAY SOMETHING BACK...

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.618
THIS WAS OUR FAULT.
WE CAN'T NOT

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:54.420
MAKE IT UP TO YOU SOMEHOW,
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.490
YOU'RE VERY HONORABLE...
HOW ABOUT THIS?--

00:10:57.557 --> 00:10:59.092
YOU GUYS DUEL US
RIGHT NOW

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.593
AND IF YOU WIN,
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.661
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.663
ABOUT PAYING
FOR ANY DAMAGES.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.631
REALLY?...

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:05.598
Andre: SURE, WHY NOT?

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.100
THIS IS OUR PRIVATE
PRACTICE LANE

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:09.335
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW,
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE RULES

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:11.871
STATING THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY
DUEL WHILE WE'RE OUT HERE.

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:13.072
Jean: DON'T BE
ABSURD, ANDRE.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.441
WE ONLY HAVE THIS LANE
FOR AN HOUR OR SO.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.143
OH RIGHT, THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH TIME

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.145
FOR A 3-ON-3 BATTLE,
IS THERE?...

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:22.649
WELL THEN HOW ABOUT
YUSEI AND I GO
MONO Y MONO?

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:24.050
YOU N' ME?

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.152
I HAVE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:28.221
I WANT TO SEE
THE SKILL THAT WON YOU

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:30.256
THE FORTUNE CUP
IN ACTION.

00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:31.791
YEAH, NOW THINGS
ARE GETTING EXCITING.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.126
DO IT, YUSEI!

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:35.662
BUT THEY'RE
OUR FIRST OPPONENTS
IN THE PRELIMINARIES.

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:36.996
THAT'S JUST WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:39.165
THERE'S NO NEED
TO SHOW THEM OUR HAND YET.

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.634
DO NOT ACCEPT
THIS CHALLENGE, YUSEI.

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:42.869
LET'S GO, ANDRE.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:44.737
WE SHOULDN'T INTIMIDATE
THEM INTO DOING

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.606
SOMETHING THEY
DON'T WANNA DO.

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.575
WHAT!?
LOOK--I GET IT,

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:49.976
YOU GUYS
KNOW WHO WE ARE.

00:11:50.043 --> 00:11:51.578
YOU'RE PROBABLY
SCARED TO DUEL US

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:52.912
IN THE TOURNAMENT
AS IT IS,

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.147
IT MAKES SENSE.

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:57.116
ARE YOU DAFT!?

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:58.851
YOU THINK WE'RE SCARED OF YOU!?

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.186
THAT'S--...!
THAT'S--...!

00:12:00.253 --> 00:12:02.589
YUSEI!
YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT
THIS CHALLENGE!

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:04.257
DO NOT BACK DOWN!

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.794
ALRIGHT, THEN...
IF THIS IS HOW

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.863
YOU WANNA SETTLE THINGS,
THEN LET'S DUEL...
YOU AND ME.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.765
NOW THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:30.016
Duel Runner Computer:
DUEL MODE ENGAGED!

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:37.090
Breo: I HOPE THIS
LITTLE RUSE PROVES TO BE
WORTH THE TROUBLE.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:39.359
CONSIDERING THAT
I'M THE ONE WHO
HAD TO TAKE THE FALL.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.294
AND YOU MADE IT LOOK
SO CONVINCING.

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.229
THANKS TO YOUR LITTLE
"ACCIDENT", BREO,

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.764
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET
A SNEAK PEEK

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.267
AT YUSEI'S STRENGTHS
AND WEAKNESSES.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.736
YEAH, BUT HOW DO
WE KNOW FOR SURE
THAT THIS TEAM

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.804
IS EVEN WORTH
THE BOTHER, JEAN?

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:54.641
WELL, JACK ATLAS WAS
THE TOP TURBO DUELIST

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:57.577
UNTIL YUSEI CAME ALONG
AND WON THE FORTUNE CUP...

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:00.780
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
TEAM 5D'S WILL IMPRESS.

00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:03.316
HOW IMPRESSIVE
CAN THEY BE IF
THEY CAN'T EVEN TELL

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:04.617
WHEN THEY'RE
BEING DUPED.

00:13:04.684 --> 00:13:07.854
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE
THE ENEMY, BREO...

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.289
THEY'RE ABOUT TO BEGIN.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:12.892
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS
YUSEI FUDO IS MADE OF.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.735
HEH HEH!

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:24.003
Crow: OH YEAH!

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.105
THAT'S HOW TEAM 5D'S
GETS IT DONE!

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:27.907
NOW HE GETS TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.909
AAW. A DELAYED
POWER THRUST.

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:31.444
ISN'T THAT
JUST PRECIOUS?

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:35.748
BEST PART IS--I TOLD
ANDRE TO HOLD HIS
THROTTLE AT 80%.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.183
[LAUGHS]

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.990
LET'S REV IT UP!
I DRAW!

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:46.793
I SUMMON MAX WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.099
AND WITH THAT,
I END MY TURN.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.702
Breo: REALLY...THAT'S
HIS BIG OPENING?

00:13:55.768 --> 00:13:58.237
PERHAPS HE IS WAITING
FOR ANDRE TO REVEAL
HIS DECK

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:00.440
BY MAKING THE FIRST
BIG MOVE.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.009
AND WHICH DECK
DID YOU TELL
ANDRE TO USE?

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.044
I REASONED THAT
THE QUICK ATTACK
POWER DECK

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:07.246
WOULD BE THE EASIEST
FOR THEM TO COMPREHEND

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.949
AND WOULD LEAVE A STRONG
AND LASTING IMPRESSION.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.417
THE QUICK ATTACK
POWER DECK,

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:12.719
SO THAT'S
WHY YOU DECIDED

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.454
THAT ANDRE SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO DUEL.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.490
EXACTLY.
YOU CAN PRE-STRATEGIZE
ALL YOU WANT,

00:14:17.557 --> 00:14:19.892
BUT IF YOU DON'T DRAW
THE CARDS YOU NEED
AT THE BEGINNING,

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.994
YOUR STRATEGY
GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.764
THAT'S WHEN HOW YOU PLAY
THE CARDS BECOMES IMPORTANT.

00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:26.432
AND THE QUICK ATTACK
POWER DECK

00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:28.334
CAN BE ESPECIALLY TRICKY.

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:31.137
ANDRE IS A MASTER OF
DECIPHERING THE BEST STRATEGY

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.005
WITHIN THE LIMITED HAND
HE IS GIVEN.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.474
HE ROLLS
WITH THE PUNCHES....

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.109
NO MATTER
WHAT COMES HIS WAY,

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:38.644
HE CAN SPIN IT INTO
A BEAUTIFUL COMBO.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.180
THE GUY IS A TRUE POET
OF THE CARDS.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:44.751
[THINKING] IT'S TIME
FOR THE MATADOR
TO START ANGERING THE BULL.

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.652
IT'S MY TURN NOW, YUSEI!

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:50.957
I SUMMON PLAYFUL POSSUM
TO THE FIELD!

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:56.696
THEN I ACTIVATE THE POSSUM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.431
WHEN YOU HAVE A MONSTER
OUT ON YOUR FIELD

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:01.134
WITH MORE ATTACK POINTS
THAN PLAYFUL POSSUM...

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.436
I CAN DESTROY THIS CARD!

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:06.239
NOW GO!

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.275
WHAT!?

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:11.411
THAT'S WEIRD...WHY BRING
A MONSTER TO THE FIELD

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.212
AND THEN DESTROY IT
RIGHT AWAY?

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.915
HMPH! THIS IS ONE OF
MY FAVORITE COMBOS.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:17.583
IT'S A GENUINE
WORK OF ART.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.118
DUE TO PLAYFUL POSSUM'S
DESTRUCTION,

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:21.587
I CAN SUMMON GREEN BABOON,
DEFENDER OF THE FOREST

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:22.922
FROM MY HAND!

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:29.262
YOU SEE, YUSEI,

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.731
WHEN A BEAST-TYPE MONSTER
ON MY FIELD IS DESTROYED,

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:34.467
I CAN THEN SUMMON GREEN BABOON
DIRECTLY FROM MY HAND

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.402
BY PAYING 1,000 LIFE POINTS!

00:15:36.469 --> 00:15:38.638
I FIGURED IT WAS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:40.239
I MEAN, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE DESTROYING

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:43.176
THE FIRST MONSTER
YOU SUMMONED FOR MY BENEFIT.

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:44.343
GO, GREEN BABOON!

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.779
ATTACK MAX WARRIOR
WITH HAMMER CLUB!

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:10.136
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT
ATTACK WAS SOMETHING,

00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:12.872
JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT
THESE TWO FACEDOWNS CAN DO.

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:15.808
CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT!

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:19.178
FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE ANGEL BATON SPEED SPELL!

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:21.080
WHEN I HAVE TWO OR MORE
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.383
I CAN USE THIS CARD'S POWER TO
DRAW TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK...

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.753
AS LONG AS I SEND ONE CARD
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.592
FOR MY NEXT MOVE,
I'M ACTIVATING ANOTHER
ANGEL BATON!

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.260
DOUBLING HIS SPEED SPELL!?

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:36.963
Breo: A VERY CLEVER MANEUVER.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.566
AND NOW--I'M SUMMONING
JUNK SYNCHRON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.039
WHEN I SUCCESSFULLY SUMMON
JUNK SYNCHRON,

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.442
I CAN ALSO SUMMON A LEVEL
2-OR-BELOW MONSTER

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.310
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.779
SAY HELLO TO SPEED WARRIOR!

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.116
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET!...

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.519
SINCE JUNK SYNCHRON
IS A TUNER MONSTER,

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:01.621
I CAN ALSO SUMMON
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.589
DIRECTLY FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:08.227
Jean: HE MANAGED
TO SUMMON BOTH OF

00:17:08.294 --> 00:17:09.562
THE MONSTERS
THAT HE DISCARDED

00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:12.198
TO PAY FOR THE COST OF
THOSE TWO SPEED SPELLS.

00:17:12.265 --> 00:17:15.401
AN ALL IN ONE COMBO.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:18.271
IT SEEMS HE'S LIVING UP
TO HIS REPUTATION.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:20.740
THESE ARE PROBABLY
HIS STANDARD MOVES.

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:23.743
BET HE PRACTICES
THESE EVERY DAY.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:27.013
HMPH. IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.549
NOW, BOTH MY LEVEL 3
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG...

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:31.450
AND MY LEVEL 2
SPEED WARRIOR...

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.020
WILL GET A TUNING
FROM JUNK SYNCHRON.

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:49.101
I SYNCHRO SUMMON--
JUNK ARCHER!

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:52.772
NEXT--I ACTIVATE
JUNK ARCHER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.974
ONCE A TURN...
JUNK ARCHER CAN REMOVE

00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:57.843
A MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD
ENTIRELY FROM PLAY!

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.879
GO DIMENSION SHOT!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.149
Crow: YE-E-EAH!
NOW ANDRE'S GOT

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.917
NO MONSTERS
ON HIS FIELD!

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.285
HE'S ALL YOURS, YUSEI!

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:07.720
NOW PUT HIM
IN HIS PLACE!

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.256
NOW JUNK ARCHER--
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:12.925
GO SCRAP ARROW!

00:18:12.992 --> 00:18:16.095
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK HARDER THAN
THAT TO GET TO ME!

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:18.264
I ACTIVATE
BATTLE INSTINCT!

00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.966
WHEN I FIND MYSELF
THE TARGET

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:21.300
OF A DIRECT ATTACK...

00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:23.202
I CAN ACTIVATE THIS CARD
AND SUMMON

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:26.138
A LEVEL 4-OR-BELOW
MONSTER FROM MY HAND!

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:28.941
I CALL FORTH...
NIMBLE MOMONGA!

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.613
MAN!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.682
Leo: ANDRE MAY'VE
AVOIDED A DIRECT HIT...

00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:39.285
BUT YUSEI STILL MANAGED
TO DAMAGE HIM.

00:18:39.352 --> 00:18:40.853
IT'S AT THIS MOMENT
THAT MOMONGA'S

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.788
SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:45.891
WHEN IT'S DESTROYED
IN BATTLE AND SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.260
I CAN REGAIN 1,000
LIFE POINTS...

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:50.963
...AND I CAN SUMMON
TWO MORE NIMBLE MOMONGAS

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.065
TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:59.672
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN...
AND END MY TURN.

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.507
SINCE WE HAVE REACHED
THE END PHASE,

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:02.975
THE GREEN BABOON
THAT JUNK ARCHER'S

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.710
SPECIAL ABILITY
REMOVED FROM PLAY

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:06.245
RETURNS TO THE FIELD.

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.547
Leo: WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:10.983
IT SEEMED LIKE YUSEI
WAS ROCKING HIS TURN.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.120
Akiza: LOOK. ANDRE ONLY LOST
300 LIFE POINTS.

00:19:14.186 --> 00:19:16.856
AND HE'S GOT 3 MONSTERS
ON HIS FIELD.

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.392
THAT ANDRE GUY WAS ABLE
TO USE YUSEI'S TURN

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.960
TO HIS COMPLETE ADVANTAGE.

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:22.695
ANDRE'S DOING WELL.

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:24.964
THESE ARE HIS NATURAL
INSTINCTS AT WORK.

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:27.099
HE'S A MASTER AT
FINESSING A BATTLE.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.935
YOUR ATTACK JUST NOW
WAS CARELESS, YUSEI.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.405
YOU'VE GOT OPENINGS
IN YOUR STRATEGY...

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:34.940
WHICH I WILL
NOW EXPLOIT!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.008
FIRST, I ACTIVATE

00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:37.977
PLAYFUL POSSUM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:39.912
WHEN PLAYFUL POSSUM
IS IN THE GRAVEYARD

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:41.247
DUE TO ITS OWN ABILITY,

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:42.848
I CAN RE-SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.784
DURING
THE STANDBY PHASE!

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.788
THEN I RELEASE
BOTH PLAYFUL POSSUM
AND NIMBLE MOMONGA

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:51.023
IN ORDER
TO SUMMON BEHEMOTH

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.059
THE KING OF ALL ANIMALS!

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:05.137
Duel Runner Computer:
BEHEMOTH THE KING OF ALL ANIMALS

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.039
IS A LEVEL 7 BEAST-TYPE MONSTER

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:11.143
WITH 2700 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1500 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.212
WHOA, THAT THING IS HUGE.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:16.048
Andre: AS IS THE POWER OF
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:18.084
WHEN BEHEMOTH IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.686
I CAN MOVE THE SAME NUMBER
OF BEAST-TYPE MONSTERS

00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:22.188
FROM MY GRAVEYARD TO MY HAND

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.824
AS THE NUMBER OF MONSTERS
I USED TO SUMMON IT!

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.960
WHICH LETS ME GAIN
TWO NIMBLE MOMONGAS!

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.430
AS FOR THE ONE
ON MY FIELD...

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:33.466
I SWITCH IT
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:37.103
Leo: YIKES...

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.805
Akiza: YEAH, I'M NOT SURE
I WANNA WATCH THIS.

00:20:39.872 --> 00:20:42.408
DON'T WORRY.
YUSEI CAN
TURN THIS AROUND.

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:45.277
ANDRE HAS 3 BACK-TO-BACK
ATTACKS READY TO GO...

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:46.445
HE CAN'T WIN THIS.

00:20:46.512 --> 00:20:47.680
YA THINK...?

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:49.081
Both: COME ON!

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.585
SLOW DOWN...
YOU'VE ONLY LET YUSEI

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:54.120
EXECUTE A FEW MOVES...

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.155
WASN'T THE WHOLE POINT
OF DUELING HIM NOW

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:58.057
TO STUDY HIS SKILLS?

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.192
MAYBE I WAS WRONG...

00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:02.261
IF ANDRE CAN DEFEAT HIM
THIS QUICKLY...

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:03.562
THEN PERHAPS THIS YUSEI

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:07.099
ISN'T A THREAT TO US
AFTER ALL...?
