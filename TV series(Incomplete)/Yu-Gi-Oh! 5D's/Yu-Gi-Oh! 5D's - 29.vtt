00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:09.717
YOUR EYES...

00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:11.920
THEY'RE SHOWING ME
THE PATH YOU WILL TAKE.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.388
IT IS A PATH
THAT WILL DISAPPEAR

00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:15.323
INTO A DARKNESS CARLY...

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:18.326
OH, YEAH? HUH.
THAT'S NICE.

00:08:18.326 --> 00:08:20.895
BUT... WHEN YOU CHOOSE
TO TAKE THIS PATH...

00:08:20.895 --> 00:08:24.499
YOU WILL KNOW YOURSELF BETTER
THAN YOU EVER HAVE BEFORE.

00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:27.001
EH!? UH, EXCUSE ME!

00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:28.703
THIS HAS BEEN FUN,
BUT I GOTTA RUN HOME

00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:30.538
AND FEED MY PLANT
AND WATER MY CAT.

00:08:34.843 --> 00:08:36.344
[THINKING] I THINK
FAME HAS MADE HER

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:38.780
TWO TACOS SHORT OF A FIESTA.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.215
ENJOYING THE FILM?

00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:42.483
WHEN CAN I TALK
TO GOODWIN?

00:08:42.483 --> 00:08:44.018
BE PATIENT, YUSEI.

00:08:44.018 --> 00:08:45.753
THE DIRECTOR IS A BUSY MAN.

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:47.589
IF YOU'RE BORED,
WE COULD ALWAYS

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:50.091
PASS THE TIME WITH A DUEL,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.094
ARE YOU GAME,
OR ARE YOU AFRAID
YOU MIGHT LOSE YOUR TITLE

00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:55.563
BEFORE YOUR FIRST
ENDORSEMENT DEAL
COMES THROUGH?!

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:58.366
HEH! NOW THAT WOULD BE
AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.702
THOUGH I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
OUR NEW CHAMPION

00:09:00.702 --> 00:09:03.605
WOULD FOLD TO A MAN OF YOUR
CALIBER, OFFICER TRUDGE.

00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:04.873
WHY, YOU...!

00:09:04.873 --> 00:09:06.941
SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING.

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:10.478
THE DIRECTOR IS READY
TO SEE YOU, NOW.

00:09:10.478 --> 00:09:12.580
MISTER GOODWIN WOULD
LIKE TO THANK YOU

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.282
FOR ESCORTING
THE CHAMPION HERE...

00:09:14.282 --> 00:09:16.150
NOW HE'D LIKE YOU
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.153
AND FETCH JACK.

OUTSIDE OF DOMINO HOSPITAL,

IN THE FORTUNE CUP FINALE,

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:36.437
AND AS OF NOW,
NOBODY HAS BEEN

00:09:36.437 --> 00:09:38.339

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:39.307
SORRY ABOUT THAT!

00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:40.308
I'LL SHOW YOU SORRY...

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.210
WE'RE STILL LIVE!
[GASP] RIGHT,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.245
UM, AS OF NOW,
NOBODY HAS BEEN

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:45.747
ALLOWED INSIDE
TO SEE OR TALK...

[EXHALES] I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
NURSE'S COSTUME IS WORKING.

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:54.188
GO AND FETCH JACK.

HMPH! TALKING TO ME
LIKE I'M SOME DOG...

00:09:57.292 --> 00:09:59.027
IF ONLY THEY KNEW
I WAS DOING THIS

00:09:59.027 --> 00:10:00.662
TO GET CLOSER TO GOODWIN
TO FIND OUT

00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:02.196
WHAT HE'S REALLY UP TO...

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:07.635
HUH?!

I'D LIKE TO BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW, MINA.

MR. ATLAS!

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.513
UM-SAY... I WAS WONDERING
IF, UH...

00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:10.749
Jack: TRUDGE.

00:11:10.749 --> 00:11:13.152
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
A LITTLE ROUGH, OFFICER.

00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:23.195
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:23.195 --> 00:11:25.064
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THAT MARK ON YOUR ARM?

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.836
ATTACK! AND WIPE HIS MARK CLEAN!

00:11:30.836 --> 00:11:31.870
[SCREAMING SQUAWK]

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.539
Carly: THAT'S THE SAME
GLOWING MARK

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:35.207
THAT HOODED DUELIST
HAD ON HIS ARM

00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:37.076
WHEN HE WAS DUELING YUSEI!

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.513
SO YOU THE FIFTH SIGNER?

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:44.516
MY MASTER IS A DARK SIDER
AND HE SENT ME HERE

00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:46.752
TO EXTINGUISH THE LIGHT
OF YOUR MARK

00:11:46.752 --> 00:11:48.320
SO THAT WE MAY
ENVELOP THE WORLD

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.390
IN A CLOAK OF DARKNESS.

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:53.492
AND YOU WILL BE
THE FIRST TO FALL.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:55.761
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT.

00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:58.263
HANG ON, YOU CAN'T
DUEL HIM, JACK!

00:11:58.263 --> 00:11:59.999
YUSEI BATTLED
SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:01.634
IT WAS SOME GUY
DRESSED IN A BATH ROBE,

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:03.469
AND HE HAD THE SAME
WEIRD PURPLE MARK

00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:04.670
GLOWING ON HIS
ARM AND...

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.971
I'M CARLY,
BY THE WAY.

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:07.706
WHAT? DID YOU
SAY YUSEI?

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:09.074
WHEN DID
ALL THIS HAPPEN?

00:12:09.074 --> 00:12:12.044
LAST NIGHT, AND...
YUSEI WON.

00:12:12.044 --> 00:12:14.013
CARLY?
YEAH! HI!

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:15.381
TELL ME
SOMETHING, CARLY...

00:12:15.381 --> 00:12:17.116
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO DUEL?

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:18.584
WELL...
KINDA, BUT...

00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:20.986
IN THAT CASE...
LEND ME YOUR HANDS,
WILL YOU?

00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:25.290
YOU JUST HAVE TO HOLD
THE CARDS FOR ME
AND DRAW, ALRIGHT?

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.693
HUH!?...BUT I, UH...

00:12:27.693 --> 00:12:30.396
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
THIS PURPLE GLOW
IS ALL ABOUT...

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:31.463
BUT IF YUSEI WAS ABLE

00:12:31.463 --> 00:12:32.965
TO TAKE SOMEONE
LIKE HIM DOWN,

00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.234
THEN I'LL HAVE
NO PROBLEM.

00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:37.703
COME ON... PUT
THE DUEL DISK ON MY ARM.

00:12:37.703 --> 00:12:39.071
RIGHT. OKAY.

00:12:40.272 --> 00:12:41.640

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.808
All: BRING IT ON!

00:12:42.808 --> 00:12:44.376
WOW... DID I JUST SAY THAT?

00:12:47.946 --> 00:12:50.849

HEY! JACK, LOOK,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.452
YOUR ARM IS GLOWING, TOO!

00:12:53.452 --> 00:12:54.887
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:12:54.887 --> 00:12:56.822
YUSEI'S ARM WAS GLOWING
LAST NIGHT AS WELL

00:12:56.822 --> 00:12:58.557
AND THEN THIS SAME
CIRCLE APPEARED.

00:12:58.557 --> 00:12:59.992
WHAT'S IT ALL MEAN?

00:12:59.992 --> 00:13:02.795
LET'S CUT THE CONVERSATION,
SHALL WE?

00:13:04.329 --> 00:13:07.733
I'M SUMMONING WARM WORM
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.740
THIS IS REAL FRONTLINE
JOURNALISM RIGHT HERE,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.077

ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY TURN!

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:21.513
OH RIGHT, SORRY.

00:13:21.513 --> 00:13:23.348
TO START
THINGS OFF..
I'M SUMMONING

00:13:23.348 --> 00:13:25.150
VICE DRAGON
FROM MY HAND!

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.418
RIGHT!

00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:30.255
Jack: WHOEVER
YOU REALLY ARE...

00:13:30.255 --> 00:13:32.458
YOU'VE GOT SOME GALL
COMING HERE.

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:34.993
DID YOU THINK
YOU COULD KICK ME
WHILE I WAS DOWN?

00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:36.395
WELL, I'M NOT DOWN!

00:13:36.428 --> 00:13:38.630
AND THERE'S NO WAY
SOME DADDY LONGLEGS

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.032
IS GONNA TRIP ME UP.

00:13:40.032 --> 00:13:41.934
I RELEASE VICE
DRAGON TO SUMMON OUT

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:44.436
STRONG WIND DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:48.173 --> 00:13:50.876
NEXT, I'M ACTIVATING
STRONG WIND DRAGON'S

00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:52.211
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:54.246
NOW IT GAINS HALF
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:13:54.246 --> 00:13:55.948
OF THE DRAGON
MONSTER I RELEASED

00:13:55.948 --> 00:13:57.349
IN ORDER
TO SUMMON IT.

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:01.353
SO, UH... RIGHT,
OKAY, SINCE VICE DRAGON

00:14:01.353 --> 00:14:02.921
HAS 2,400 ATTACK POINTS...

00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:04.656
IT GAINS
A THOUSAND MORE!

00:14:04.656 --> 00:14:07.893
WOAH!... THIRTY-FOUR
HUNDRED?!

00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:10.596
STRONG WIND DRAGON...
ATTACK WARM WORM!

00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:16.935
WHY'D THE FLOOR
EXPLODE?!

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:18.871
I DUNNO, BUT THE SAME
KINDA STUFF WAS HAPPENING

00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:21.540
WHEN YUSEI WAS BATTLING
THAT UNDERGROUND DUELIST
FROM LAST NIGHT.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.443
IT WAS LIKE DUEL THINGS
WERE REALLY HAPPENING
OR SOMETHING...

00:14:24.443 --> 00:14:26.745
SO HE'S MAKING
THIS DUEL REAL.

00:14:26.745 --> 00:14:29.748
Carly: BY THE WAY?... WARM WORM
WAS IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:29.748 --> 00:14:32.050
HOW COME HE LOST
LIFE POINTS?

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.119
STRONG WIND DRAGON'S
SPECIAL POWER

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:36.488
ENABLES IT
TO FIGHT THROUGH
A MONSTER'S DEFENSES

00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:37.856
AND ATTACK DIRECTLY.

00:14:37.856 --> 00:14:39.825
AS LONG AS ITS ATTACK
POINTS ARE GREATER

00:14:39.825 --> 00:14:41.827
THAN THE OPPONENT'S
DEFENSE POINTS...

00:14:41.827 --> 00:14:43.595
THE DIFFERENCE
IS DEALT AS DAMAGE.

00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:44.830
THIS IS GREAT!

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.699
I'M DUELING WITH THE DECK
OF A ONCE GREAT DUELIST!

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:49.067
A ONCE GREAT DUELIST!?

00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:51.136
I ONLY LOST YESTERDAY,

HEY HAS-BEEN,

00:14:55.107 --> 00:14:57.376
WHEN WARM WORM IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE...

00:14:57.376 --> 00:15:00.445
YOU HAVE TO SEND
3 CARDS FROM YOUR DECK
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:02.714
OH! I'M SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT, RIGHT?

00:15:02.714 --> 00:15:05.184
THE TOP 3?...THAT'S
HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?

00:15:06.752 --> 00:15:09.922
[SNICKERS]

00:15:09.922 --> 00:15:13.025
I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:14.493
UH... RIGHT.

00:15:16.328 --> 00:15:18.831
IT'S MY MOVE
AND FROM MY HAND,

00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:21.200
I SUMMON SHIELD WORM
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.202
WHEN THIS MONSTER IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED...

00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:25.537
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE ASSISTANT
MUST SEND ONE CARD

00:15:25.537 --> 00:15:27.806
FROM YOUR DECK
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:30.209
EH?! AGAIN?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.146
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:34.146 --> 00:15:36.582
AND NOW... I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:37.983
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:39.952
THEN IT'S MY MOV...!...
I MEAN...

00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:41.720
LEMME SEE MY CARDS...

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.855
HUH?

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:45.958
THAT SPELL CARD COULD BE
QUITE USEFUL RIGHT NOW,

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.393
BUT I WOULD
HAVE TO RELEASE
STRONG WIND DRAGON

00:15:48.393 --> 00:15:49.661
IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE IT.

00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:51.129
I KNOW WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO!

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:53.165
STRONG WIND DRAGON
TAKE OUT HIS SHIELD WORM

00:15:53.165 --> 00:15:54.366
WITH A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:15:54.366 --> 00:15:56.568
DIMWIT!
WHAT?! DID I MESS UP?

00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:00.706
HA HA!

00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:02.608
YOU WALKED
RIGHT INTO THAT ONE!

00:16:02.608 --> 00:16:05.510
SHIELD WORM IS ABLE
TO DEFLECT ANY ATTACK!

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.778
[GASP]

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:08.347
THEREFORE, IT ALSO NEGATES

00:16:08.347 --> 00:16:10.749
STRONG WIND DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:13.318
AND WITH THAT,
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD!

00:16:13.318 --> 00:16:14.953
REGRET REBORN.

00:16:14.953 --> 00:16:17.489
THIS CARD ENABLES ME
TO RESUMMON A MONSTER

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:19.291
THAT YOU DESTROYED
IN BATTLE...

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:22.261
AS LONG AS I SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.398
AND OF COURSE...
SINCE SHIELD WORM

00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:29.434
HAS ONCE AGAIN
BEEN SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED TO MY FIELD,

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:32.604
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SEND ANOTHER CARD
IN YOUR DECK

00:16:32.604 --> 00:16:34.106
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:36.041
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT,
ISN'T IT?

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.043
JACK, I AM SO SO SORRY!

00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:40.812
[THINKING] NOT AS SORRY
AS TRUDGE IS GOING TO BE.

00:16:56.719 --> 00:16:58.587
Jack: TRUDGE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA WIN THIS DUEL!

00:16:58.587 --> 00:16:59.622
AND TO MAKE SURE OF IT,

00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:01.757
I'M SUMMONING
TWIN-SHIELD DEFENDER

00:17:01.757 --> 00:17:03.659
TO THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:05.361
UH... HERE!

00:17:09.865 --> 00:17:11.634
IT'S MY TURN THEN.

00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:15.137
FROM MY HAND, I'M ACTIVATING
THE SPELL CARD... WORM BAIT!

00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:17.873
AND AS LONG AS THERE'S
A WORM MONSTER ON MY FIELD,

00:17:17.873 --> 00:17:19.375
I CAN USE THE POWER
OF THIS SPELL

00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:22.144
TO SUMMON OUT
TWO WORM TOKENS!

00:17:25.848 --> 00:17:28.050
NEXT, I RELEASE
THE TWO WORM TOKENS

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.087
IN ORDER TO ADVANCE SUMMON
DARK TUNER CATASTROGUE!

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:38.694
Jack: DID HE SAY
"DARK TUNER?"

00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.429
OKAY, THIS MIGHT BE BAD.

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:41.664
THIS HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:43.732
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, UM...

00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:46.101
NOW I DARK TUNE
MY LEVEL 8 CATASTROGUE

00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:48.304
WITH MY LEVEL 4
SHIELD WORM.

00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:51.140
WHAT'S THIS
DARK TUNING BUSINESS
ALL ABOUT CARLY?

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.809
THAT ROBED DUELIST DID
THE SAME THING LAST NIGHT.

00:17:53.809 --> 00:17:55.244
SOMETHING ABOUT
MONSTERS USING

00:17:55.244 --> 00:17:56.579
NEGATIVE ENERGY AND SHADOWS

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:59.882
AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER
REALLY EERIE SOUNDING STUFF.

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:03.552
Trudge: WHEN
SHADOWS ARE DEVOURED
BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS...

00:18:03.552 --> 00:18:06.222
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS...

00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:08.457
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:14.897
NOW RISE!... DARK DIVINER!

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.136
Duel Runner Computer:
DARK DIVINER IS A NEGATIVE LEVEL
4 DARK SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:25.441
WITH 2,000 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1,000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:28.978
WHAT?! SO THAT THING'S
LEVEL IS A NEGATIVE 4!

00:18:28.978 --> 00:18:30.112
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:30.112 --> 00:18:31.513
THE MONSTERS
OF THE NETHERWORLD

00:18:31.513 --> 00:18:33.883
DON'T COME TOGETHER
AND BUILD ON ONE ANOTHER

00:18:33.883 --> 00:18:36.252
THE WAY YOUR
PATHETIC MONSTERS DO.

00:18:36.285 --> 00:18:37.853
THEY DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER

00:18:37.853 --> 00:18:40.189
AND FEED OFF EACH OTHER'S
NEGATIVE ENERGY

00:18:40.189 --> 00:18:41.891
LIKE A SNAKE
EATING ITS OWN TAIL.

00:18:41.891 --> 00:18:43.158
RIGHT! THAT'S KINDA WHAT

00:18:43.158 --> 00:18:45.127
THE UNDERGROUND DUELIST
SAID TO YUSEI LAST NIGHT

00:18:45.127 --> 00:18:47.463
AFTER PERFORMING
THE SAME KIND OF
SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:18:47.463 --> 00:18:48.998
INTERESTING...

00:18:48.998 --> 00:18:50.666
CATASTROGUE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:50.666 --> 00:18:52.501
ACTIVATES FROM
THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:55.304
BECAUSE I USED THIS CARD
TO PERFORM A DARK SYNCHRO...

00:18:55.304 --> 00:18:57.473
I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE
TO SEND 5 MORE CARDS

00:18:57.473 --> 00:18:59.308
FROM YOUR DECK
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:18:59.308 --> 00:19:03.245
KEEP DOING THAT AND WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY CARDS LEFT.

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:07.082
AND NOW DARK DIVINER,
SLAY HIS STRONG WIND DRAGON!

00:19:07.082 --> 00:19:09.418
WAIT, WHAT?!
BUT STRONG WIND DRAGON

00:19:09.418 --> 00:19:10.486
HAS MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:19:10.486 --> 00:19:12.388
THAN YOUR DARK DIVINER
THING-A-MA-WHAT.

00:19:12.388 --> 00:19:14.323
THAT'S NOT WHAT
MATTERS TO HIM.

00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:18.627
THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN
DARK DIVINER ATTACKS...

00:19:18.627 --> 00:19:21.330
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS
BECOME THE SAME.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.667
AND FOR EVERY
100 ATTACK POINTS
YOUR DRAGON LOSES,

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:27.569
YOU HAVE TO SEND ONE CARD
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:19:27.569 --> 00:19:29.238
I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU.

00:19:29.238 --> 00:19:31.840
SO-UM... THAT MEANS
14 CARDS, RIGHT?

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.642
WHAT DOES THAT
LEAVE US WITH?

00:19:34.376 --> 00:19:35.744
JUST ENOUGH.

00:19:35.744 --> 00:19:38.013
WHAT!? ARE YOU
FEELING OK?

00:19:38.013 --> 00:19:39.615
Trudge: WE OF
THE NETHERWORLD CAME HERE

00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:41.250
TO ROB YOU
OF YOUR POWER,

00:19:41.283 --> 00:19:43.218
TO EXTINGUISH THE LIGHT
OF YOUR WORLD

00:19:43.218 --> 00:19:45.387
BY BURYING YOU
IN THE SHADOWS.

00:19:45.387 --> 00:19:47.957
DARK DIVINER... ATTACK!

00:19:47.957 --> 00:19:49.525
BRING IT, OFFICER.

00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:52.761
AAAAH!!

00:19:52.761 --> 00:19:53.996
WHAT'RE YOU...!?

00:19:53.996 --> 00:19:57.032
AAAAAH, I'M
PROTECTING YOU!

00:19:57.032 --> 00:19:58.600
HEY!

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.936
ATTACK ALL YOU WANT,
BUT STRONG WIND DRAGON

00:20:00.936 --> 00:20:02.538
CAN'T BE DESTROYED
BY A MONSTER

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:04.540
WITH THE SAME NUMBER
OF ATTACK POINTS!

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.508
DARK DIVINER CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:20:06.508 --> 00:20:08.410
SO WE'VE GOT A STALEMATE.

00:20:11.113 --> 00:20:15.351
I'M SO SO SORRY, JACK...
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT...

00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:18.153
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO HELP, UH...

00:20:18.153 --> 00:20:20.889
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME
AGAIN? CALI?

00:20:20.889 --> 00:20:22.691
MY... MY NAME IS CARLY.

00:20:22.691 --> 00:20:23.859
WHAT SAY YOU, CARLY?...

00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:25.327
LET'S FINISH THIS
TOGETHER.

00:20:25.327 --> 00:20:27.429
OH! OH, UH...

00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:28.530
IT'S MY AND...

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:29.531
AND... AND... AND,

00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:31.367
AND, AND MY...
Both: TURN!

00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:35.404
FROM OUR HAND, CARLY AND I

00:20:35.404 --> 00:20:38.040
ARE ACTIVATING
THE MIND TRUST SPELL CARD!

00:20:39.408 --> 00:20:42.678
WITH THIS SPELL,
WE CAN RELEASE
A POWERFUL MONSTER...

00:20:42.678 --> 00:20:44.813
TO PULL A WEAKER MONSTER
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD

00:20:44.813 --> 00:20:47.116
AND ADD IT TO OUR HAND.

00:20:47.116 --> 00:20:49.651
SO WE RELEASE
STRONG WIND DRAGON!

00:20:50.519 --> 00:20:52.755
AND THEN
FROM OUR GRAVEYARD...

00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:55.758
WE ADD DARK RESONATOR
TO OUR HAND.

00:20:57.593 --> 00:21:01.463
AND NOW WE SUMMON...
DARK RESONATOR!

00:21:01.463 --> 00:21:06.001
NEXT... DARK RESONATOR
GIVES TWIN-SHIELD
DEFENDER A TUNE-UP!

00:21:13.742 --> 00:21:15.611
WE SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:18.013
EXPLODER DRAGONWING!

00:21:20.115 --> 00:21:22.251
WHEN THIS MONSTER
BATTLES AGAINST
A MONSTER

00:21:22.251 --> 00:21:23.685
WITH FEWER
ATTACK POINTS...

00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:25.554
THAT MONSTER
IS INSTANTLY DESTROYED

00:21:25.554 --> 00:21:27.523
WITHOUT CALCULATING
ANY DAMAGE!

00:21:27.523 --> 00:21:29.091
THEN YOU GET SLAMMED
WITH DAMAGE

00:21:29.091 --> 00:21:31.493
EQUAL TO YOUR VANQUISHED
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:21:31.493 --> 00:21:33.128
IT'S OVER, CHUM!

00:21:33.128 --> 00:21:34.596
WOW! SO BACK
WHEN YOU WERE

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:36.231
THINKING OF ACTIVATING
MIND TRUST,

00:21:36.231 --> 00:21:37.399
YOU KNEW HIS GOAL
WAS TO SEND

00:21:37.399 --> 00:21:38.534
YOUR CARDS
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:21:38.534 --> 00:21:39.868
SO YOU WAITED...!

00:21:39.868 --> 00:21:41.470
YOU STILL HAVE IT, JACK!

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.072
OF COURSE I STILL
HAVE IT!

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:45.607
I ONLY
LOST THE CHAMPIONSHIP
YESTERDAY!

00:21:45.607 --> 00:21:50.079
AND NOW...
EXPLODER DRAGONWING
ATTACK DARK DIVINER!

00:21:55.084 --> 00:21:56.985
All: WOAH! AAAH!

00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:07.496
OH!

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.138
WHERE AM I?

00:22:16.138 --> 00:22:18.040
THAT'S HOW
THE OTHER GUY WAS...

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.676
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE BEING
CONTROLLED BY SOMEONE ELSE.

00:22:21.944 --> 00:22:23.745
AAH! JACK!

00:22:23.745 --> 00:22:26.682
WOULD YOU MIND...
HELPING ME GET
OUTTA THIS HOSPITAL?

00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:27.683
EH!?

00:22:27.683 --> 00:22:28.984
Carly: EXCUSE ME.

00:22:28.984 --> 00:22:31.720
PARDON ME, COMING THROUGH,
OUT OF THE WAY PLEASE...

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.022
THERE WERE SEVERAL
SMALLER BOOMS
FROM THE TOP FLOOR,

00:22:34.022 --> 00:22:35.858
AND THEN THERE WAS
A SUDDEN EXPLOSION.

00:22:38.393 --> 00:22:39.495
[THINKING] THIS IS CRAZY...

00:22:39.495 --> 00:22:41.663
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH HIM NOW?

00:22:49.171 --> 00:22:50.772
Goodwin: YUSEI.

00:22:50.772 --> 00:22:53.509
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED
THE WHOLE TRUTH.

00:22:53.509 --> 00:22:55.077
ABOUT WHAT?

00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:01.216
ABOUT WHERE
YOU COME FROM...

00:23:01.216 --> 00:23:03.318
AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
