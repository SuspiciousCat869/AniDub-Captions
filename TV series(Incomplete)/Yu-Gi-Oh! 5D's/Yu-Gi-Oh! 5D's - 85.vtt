00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:09.963

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.197

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.140

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:27.347
BUT GET OUTTA HERE!

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:28.715

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.051
YOU PUT PEOPLE IN FIXES!

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:32.686

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:37.757
WAIT! LYNDON!

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:39.859
HOLD UP!
DON'T GO.

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:41.061
YOUR MOM'S
JUST UPSET.

00:07:41.728 --> 00:07:43.096
LET'S ALL JUST TAKE
A FEW MINUTES
TO COOL DOWN--

00:07:43.763 --> 00:07:44.431
I DON'T WANNA
COOL DOWN!

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:45.699
I JUST WANT
OUTTA HERE!

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:47.033
SHE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT ME!

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:48.268
SHE JUST CARES
ABOUT HER...

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:50.370
COME ON, YOU KNOW
THAT'S JUST
NOT TRUE, LYNDON.

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:51.671
ALL I KNOW
IS THAT MY MOM

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.373
DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT MY DREAMS!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.607
NOT ONE BIT!

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:55.809
THAT'S WHY
I WANT
OUT OF HERE--

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:56.876
AND FOR GOOD!

00:07:57.544 --> 00:08:00.380
OK...YOU WANT TO GO
AND I WANT YOU TO STAY

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:01.648
SO THAT LEAVES
ONE OPTION.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.416
HUH? IT DOES?

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.019
YEAH. AND AS A PRO
DUELIST IN TRAINING,

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:07.320
I HAVE A HUNCH
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:08.788
YOU AND I
ARE GONNA DUEL

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:10.457
AND IF I WIN
YOU GIVE YOUR MOM

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:11.558
ANOTHER CHANCE...

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.093
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF YOU WIN,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.494
YOU GO ON YOUR WAY...

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:15.829
I WON'T
TRY AND STOP YOU--

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.497
YA CAN TAKE OFF
AND NEVER COME BACK

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:18.999
FOR ALL I CARE.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:20.000
HMM.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:21.134
Lyndon: FINE...

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:23.536
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL!

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:25.939
NOW LET'S GET IT ON!

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:28.675
WOW, CROW
MUST REALLY WANT

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.111
LYNDON AND ZORA
TO PATCH THINGS UP, HUH?

00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:33.480
YEAH...THE QUESTION IS...

00:08:34.147 --> 00:08:36.549
WILL ONE DUEL ACTUALLY
DO THE TRICK?

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.486
Crow: LET'S DO THIS!
YOU GO FIRST!

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:41.321
OH, WITH PLEASURE! DRAW!

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:45.058
ALRIGHTY...I SUMMON TO
THE FIELD MONSTER CLOCK!

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.862
Crow: BUT THAT
MONSTER HAS ZERO
ATTACK POINTS...

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.196
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:51.831
NOTHING!
I END MY TURN.

00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:53.133
THEN IT'S MY MOVE!

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.300
AND WITH IT,
I SUMMON

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:57.537

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:00.640
Zora: OOH, WHAT

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:01.841
BE CAREFUL SON!

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:03.610
EMBARRASSING...

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:04.878
Crow: LYNDON!

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.946
IT SURE SOUNDED
LIKE YOUR MOM
CARED ABOUT YOU

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:08.882
RIGHT THEN,
DONTCHA THINK?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.183
IF SHE CARED
ABOUT ME,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.019
SHE'D LET ME LIVE
THE LIFE I WANT!

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:14.788
LYNDON...I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:16.523
MAD WITH YOUR MOM
A LONG TIME

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.260
BUT WHEN YOU'RE MAD,
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
SEE THINGS CLEARLY!

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.695
BUT MAYBE
BY THE TIME OUR
LITTLE DUEL IS OVER

00:09:23.363 --> 00:09:24.631
THAT WON'T BE
THE CASE ANYMORE.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.032
SPEAKIN' OF
OUR DUEL,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.134

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.663
OF THE MONSTER
IT JUST SWALLOWED

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.731
AND THAT MEANS MY ROUGH
AND TUMBLE TIMEPIECE'S

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.400
ATTACK POINTS
TICK UP HIGHER

00:10:01.034 --> 00:10:02.836
THAN YOUR BLACKWING STEEL
CHAIN'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:03.970
DOESN'T MATTER!

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:05.605
WITH STEEL CHAIN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.774
I CAN STILL WAGE
A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.443
SO LET HIM
HAVE IT, BLACKWING!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.852
Crow: IT'S YOUR

RUN AWAY FROM HOME
AND NEVER COME BACK,

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:41.474
YOU'D BETTER MAKE
THIS TURN COUNT!

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:43.042

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.412
WATCH AND LEARN!
IT'S MY DRAW!

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.714
ALRIGHT, FIRST

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.304
THAT LETS ME
FLIP A COIN

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.805
AND IF IT LANDS ON HEADS

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:14.541

1200?!

00:11:18.578 --> 00:11:19.412
BUT THE BEST PART
IS THAT SINCE

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:21.548
THERE ARE TWO OF THEM OUT
AT THE SAME TIME,

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:23.149
IF EITHER OF
MY COIN FLIPS LANDS

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:24.250
IN A WAY THAT
I DON'T WANT,

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:26.085
I'M ALLOWED TO TOSS

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.357
Yusei: YEAH, AND TWO
REDOS IF THINGS

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.593

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.528
Akiza: I'M NO MATHEMATICIAN
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:37.230

00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:39.465
GETTING A WHOLE LOT
STRONGER ARE GOOD.

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:41.301

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:57.944
EVEN WITH YOUR POWER UP
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POINTS

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.379
TO WIN THAT BATTLE.

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.981
LET'S JUST END THIS TURN

THE LEAST
OF YOUR CONCERNS.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:10.957
