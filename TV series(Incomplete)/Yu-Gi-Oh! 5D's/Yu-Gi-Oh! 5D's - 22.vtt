WEBVTT

00:00:01.506 --> 00:00:03.742
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:07.479
MC: WELCOME BACK
TO THE SEMI-FINALS
OF THE FORTUNE CUP!

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.448
FIRST UP IN OUR TURBO DUEL,
WE'VE GOT YUSEI FUDO,

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:14.286
SQUARING OFF AGAINST
THE TOWER OF POWER: GREIGER!

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:17.055
YOU SAID THAT ONE OF US
WAS GOING TO HAVE TO
LOSE TODAY,

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.424
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT SOMEONE IS YOU!

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:23.528
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
ARMORY ARM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:26.431
AND THAT MEANS
THAT THIS DUEL IS OVER.

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.733
[GRUNTING]

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:34.639
GREIGER, ARE YOU OK?

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:37.943
I'M FINE.
BUT IT'S NOT OVER.

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:40.578
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
MY VILLAGE, YUSEI.

00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:43.415
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE FIRE
AND THE DESTRUCTION.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:45.150
BUT I'VE LEARNED
THE TRUTH,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.618
GOODWIN ISN'T GOING
TO HELP ME

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:48.887
REBUILD MY VILLAGE
LIKE HE PROMISED.

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:52.457
HOW COULD HE WHEN IT
ISN'T EVEN THERE
ANYMORE?

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:57.495
GREIGER!

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.564
NOW THAT THE WORLD
KNOWS WHAT YOU DID,

00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:01.733
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO PAY!

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.734
NO!

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:14.512
Jack: HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT?!

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.856
YUSEI! HOW COULD YOU?
I HAD HIM!

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:26.891
GOING AFTER HIM
WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:28.460
WHAT DO I DO?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.996
YOU TRUST ME
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:35.000

Goodwin:
PEOPLE OF NEW DOMINO CITY,

00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:51.843
IT'S ALWAYS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY
WHEN A GIFTED DUELIST
LIKE OUR VERY OWN GREIGER,

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:56.481
SUFFERS A COMPLETE
NERVOUS AND EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN
FOLLOWING SUCH AN INTENSE DUEL.

00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:00.085
BUT REST ASSURED HE'LL GET
ALL THE HELP HE NEEDS.

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:03.188
[CHEERING]

00:03:03.188 --> 00:03:07.058
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE EATING UP ALL
OF GOODWIN'S LIES.

00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:08.927
HERE COMES THAT "HELP."

00:03:08.927 --> 00:03:13.498
MR. GOODWIN'S GONNA MAKE SURE
YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU DESERVE.

00:03:13.498 --> 00:03:18.436
YUSEI, PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TAKE DOWN GOODWIN
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:27.412
Commander Koda:
DISCIPLINARY ISSUES IN SCHOOL.
DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:31.516
TELEKINETIC ABILITIES.
INTERESTING, VERY INTERESTING.

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.619
COMMANDER KODA,
YOUR DUEL'S STARTING SOON.

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.589
WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?
I'M STILL COMPILING DATA.

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.658
I'VE GOT 1,872 DUELS
TO ANALYZE

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:43.628
BEFORE I CAN COMPLETE
MY BLACK ROSE PROFILE.

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:46.698
DON'T LET US DOWN.
THE DIRECTOR IS
COUNTING ON YOU.

00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:48.867
HE WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED,

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.935
BECAUSE AFTER I DUEL
THE BLACK ROSE,

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:54.739
WE'LL KNOW WITHOUT A DOUBT
WHETHER SHE IS A SIGNER OR NOT.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.245
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING
ABOUT MY ARM,

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.815
I WAS IN AN UNFORTUNATE
ACCIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:07.318
Sayer: YOU DON'T NEED
THAT MASK ANYMORE.

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:10.054
BUT I CAN'T DUEL
WITHOUT IT NOW.

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:12.790
I CAN'T FACE THAT CROWD.

00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:16.828
COME ON. DON'T LISTEN
TO THEM, AKIZA.

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:18.530
YOU'RE NOT WHO
THEY THINK YOU ARE.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.266
YOU HAVE SPECIAL POWERS.
THAT'S WHY YOU JOINED
OUR GROUP.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:23.601
YOU'RE A PSYCHIC,
NOT A SORCERESS.

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:26.538
YOU DON'T NEED
THIS MASK.

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:29.541
IT'S TIME
WE STOPPED LIVING
IN THE SHADOWS, AKIZA.

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:33.344
IT'S TIME THE WORLD KNEW
ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE US.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:36.347
MC: WELCOME BACK
TO OUR SECOND SEMIFINAL DUEL!

00:04:36.347 --> 00:04:39.617
NOW ENTERING THE ARENA,
THE DUELING DETECTIVE:

00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:42.086
COMMANDER KODA.

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:44.822
AND HIS OPPONENT:
THE MAGICIAN WITH THE MOVES,

00:04:44.822 --> 00:04:48.326
THE PRESTIDIGITATOR WITH
THE PLAN: THE BLACK ROSE!

00:04:48.326 --> 00:04:50.361
Man: LOOK!
THE WITCH IS BACK!

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:52.697
Second man: I'M GOIN'
TO THE BATHROOM;
DON'T SAVE MY SEAT!

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:55.266
MC: GET READY TO DUEL!

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:58.203
LAST TIME SHE DUELED,
SHE ALMOST BLEW
THIS BUILDING DOWN!

00:04:58.203 --> 00:04:59.671
I KNOW, BUT I'M
NOT SCARED.

00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:01.472
IN FACT,
IT'D BE GREAT
IF THAT HAPPENED!

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:03.841
I HAVEN'T DONE ONE
OUNCE OF HOMEWORK
ALL WEEK LONG!

00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:07.178
HA! I HAVEN'T DONE A DAY
OF HOMEWORK MY WHOLE LIFE!

00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:10.081
AND JUST LOOK...
I TURNED OUT PERFECT!
HMM.

00:05:13.918 --> 00:05:16.521
YUSEI! THE NEXT MATCH
IS ABOUT TO START!

00:05:16.521 --> 00:05:19.357
SORRY. FIXIN' MY RUNNER
COMES FIRST.

00:05:19.357 --> 00:05:22.727
BUT IT'S THE BLACK ROSE.
YOU THINK SHE REALLY IS
A WITCH?

00:05:22.727 --> 00:05:26.231
NO, SHE'S MORE
DANGEROUS THAN THAT.

00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:30.201
MC: LET'S GET
THIS MATCH STARTED!

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.508
Both: LET'S DO THIS!

00:05:55.863 --> 00:05:58.532
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT LADIES FIRST!

00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:02.402
I SUMMON VIOLET WITCH!

00:06:02.402 --> 00:06:07.608
AND NEXT UP, I'M CASTING
THE FIELD SPELL BLACK
GARDEN THAT'S IN MY HAND.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.945
WELL, WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT.

00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:15.849
IT SEEMS THAT OUR
BLACK ROSE HAPPENS TO HAVE
A GREEN THUMB, DOESN'T SHE?

00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:23.957
Akiza:
I PLAY A FACEDOWN.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:27.628
MC: THE BLACK ROSE IS
GROWING STRONG WITH HER
GARDEN FIELD SPELL.

00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:29.830
WILL THE COMMANDER PRUNE
OR BE PRICKED?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.599
NOT A BAD MOVE...
[GRUNTS]

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.303
BUT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
STUDYING YOU, "BLACK ROSE."

00:06:36.303 --> 00:06:38.639
I KNOW YOUR EVERY CARD,
YOUR EVERY MOVE;

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:43.577
YOUR PAST IS A CRIME SCENE,
AND I'M JUST FOLLOWING THE CLUES
UNTIL I FINALLY BRING YOU DOWN.

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:46.513
SO FOR NOW I'LL JUST PLAY THIS
AND END MY TURN.

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:48.815
ONE CARD?! BUT HE'S
DUELING A WITCH!

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:50.784
HE'LL NEVER WIN
PLAYING LIKE THAT!

00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:53.220
TELL THE MAN WITH THE MIC
HE BETTER THINK AGAIN.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.490
THIS GIRL IS NO WITCH;
SHE HAS THE POWER
OF TELEKINESIS,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.626
WHICH MEANS SHE CAN MOVE
OBJECTS WITH HER MIND.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:02.563
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE ABOVE THE LAW!

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:07.167
IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE POWER,
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT JUSTICE
HAS IN STORE FOR YOU!

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:10.404
HE'S PERFORMING WELL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:12.773
Lazar: DID YOU TELL JACK
THAT THE COMMANDER

00:07:12.773 --> 00:07:16.009
IS THE BEST PROFILER
THE FACILITY HAS?
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.246
HE'S FAMOUS
FOR UNCOVERING
THE TRUTH.

00:07:19.246 --> 00:07:22.316
AND NOW THAT HE'S
DUELING, WE EXPECT
A SIMILAR RESULT.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:24.318
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:26.753
IT'S MY TURN! I DRAW.

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:32.526
VIOLET WITCH, ATTACK
THE COMMANDER DIRECTLY!

00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:36.129
[GROANING]

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:37.631
[GASPING]

00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:39.833
MC: THE COMMANDER IS DOWN!
WITCH OR NOT,

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:43.370
THE BLACK ROSE'S ATTACKS
STILL PACK A REAL PUNCH!

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.107
FEELS JUST LIKE IT DID
LAST TIME, AKIZA,

00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:50.010
DURING OUR MATCH
AT DUEL ACADEMY!

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.245
HUH?

00:07:51.245 --> 00:07:54.181
HUH?
DID HE JUST SAY
DUEL ACADEMY?!

00:07:54.181 --> 00:07:55.716
I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN.

00:07:55.716 --> 00:07:57.718
I WAS A THIRD YEAR.
OBELISK BLUE.

00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:59.653
I WAS ALL SET TO TURN PRO.

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:04.358
THEN THIS NEW GIRL,
A SLIFER RED, WALKS UP
AND CHALLENGES ME.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:06.560
AAH!

00:08:08.462 --> 00:08:12.032
YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS DESTROYED
MY DECK AND ALMOST ME
ALONG WITH IT.

00:08:12.032 --> 00:08:14.635
I LEFT PRO DUELING TO STUDY
THE CRIMINAL MIND.

00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:17.738
I'VE TRACKED DOWN
THE MOST DANGEROUS DUELISTS
IN NEW DOMINO CITY,

00:08:17.738 --> 00:08:19.506
BUT I WAS SAVING YOU
FOR LAST.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:23.010
AND THANKS TO GOODWIN,
I'VE GOT JUST THE CARD
FOR MY VENGEANCE.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.711
[THINKING]
BUT I WAS JUST
A CHILD THEN!

00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:26.780
I COULDN'T CONTROL
MY PSYCHIC POWERS!

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.615
I KNOW YOU.

00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:30.651
YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

00:08:30.684 --> 00:08:33.020
"LOOK AT ME! I'M AKIZA
THE TELEKINETIC!"

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.222
WELL, GUESS WHAT!
IT'S TIME FOR JUSTICE!

00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:38.225
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN TRAP CARD:
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT!

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.028
IT ACTIVATED AS SOON
AS YOU ATTACKED ME!

00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:43.897
AND NOW YOUR MONSTER'S
COMPLETELY DESTROYED!

00:08:46.667 --> 00:08:49.002
YOU'VE JUST ACTIVATED
HER SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:08:49.002 --> 00:08:51.705
IF VIOLET WITCH IS EVER
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.540
I GET TO TAKE
A PLANT-TYPE MONSTER

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.809
FROM MY DECK
AND ADD IT TO MY HAND.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:08:59.079
IT SERVES YOU RIGHT
FOR CONFUSING JUSTICE
WITH REVENGE!

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:02.416
I SELECT PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS!

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.885
AKIZA, JUSTICE IS REVENGE,

00:09:04.885 --> 00:09:07.354
AND YOUR PUNISHMENT'S
JUST BEGINNING.

00:09:07.354 --> 00:09:10.090
REMEMBER MY CRIME
AND PUNISHMENT TRAP CARD?

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.994
WELL, ITS OTHER EFFECT IS
TO AUTOMATICALLY SUMMON
A MONSTER FROM MY HAND,

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:15.996
LIKE AGENT OF HATRED.

00:09:15.996 --> 00:09:19.433
YOU CAN THINK OF THE TWO OF US
AS GOOD COP AND BAD COP.

00:09:25.906 --> 00:09:28.175
YOU WANT TO PLAY
IN MY GARDEN?

00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:29.643
YOU'VE GOT TO PAY
THE PRICE.

00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:32.112
MY FIELD SPELL CUTS
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS IN HALF!

00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:34.114
NOT A BAD COUNTER EFFECT.

00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:37.050
TOO BAD IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY ATTACK POINTS FOR YOU
TO TAKE AWAY.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.886
I KNOW YOUR DECK
AND HOW TO GET AROUND
YOUR LITTLE TRICKS.

00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:42.189
WELL, THEN YOU MUST'VE
SEEN THIS COMING,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:44.424
BECAUSE YOU SUMMONED
AGENT OF HATRED,

00:09:44.424 --> 00:09:46.593
I GET TO SUMMON
MY OWN ROSE TOKEN!

00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:49.996
IT CAN'T ATTACK, BUT
IT CAN'T BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE, EITHER.

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:51.832
SO I GUESS THAT LEAVES US
WITH TWO MONSTERS

00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:53.734
THAT AREN'T REALLY GOOD
FOR ANYTHING?

00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:56.036
YOU'RE WRONG AGAIN. HA!

00:09:56.036 --> 00:09:59.740
I DIDN'T SUMMON MY AGENT
TO ATTACK, BUT TO USE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.510
SO EACH ROUND, I RECOVER
THE LIFE POINTS I LOST
DURING ONE OF MY BATTLES

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.446
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
YOUR TELEKINETIC POWERS
CAN'T UNDO.

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:09.716
LOOKS LIKE THE ROSE
HAS LOST HER THORNS.

00:10:09.716 --> 00:10:12.819
HOW CAN HE LOSE
IF HE KEEPS GETTING
HIS LIFE POINTS BACK?

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:15.322
UH, MAYBE HE CAN'T?

00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:17.624
[GROANS]
WHAT'S WRONG, LUNA?

00:10:17.657 --> 00:10:19.693
IS YOUR ARM STILL
BOTHERING YOU?

00:10:19.693 --> 00:10:22.796
NO. IT'S, UM, NOTHING.

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:24.765
I'M SUMMONING
PHOENIXIAN SEED

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:27.134
TO MY FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:32.105
YOUR LAST MOVE GAVE ME
THE IDEA TO PLAY THIS.

00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:35.008
SEE, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY ATTACK POINTS
TO CUT IN HALF EITHER,

00:10:35.008 --> 00:10:37.844
BUT A ROSE TOKEN IS
STILL SUMMONED.

00:10:37.844 --> 00:10:39.780
AND BECAUSE
I SUMMONED THE MONSTER,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.283
IT'S GOING TO
APPEAR ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD.

00:10:43.283 --> 00:10:47.320
NOW I ACTIVATE
MY ROSE FLAME TRAP CARD!

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.857
Computer: THE TRAP CARD
ROSE FLAME DEALS
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:10:50.857 --> 00:10:55.195
TO YOUR OPPONENT WHENEVER
A PLANT-TYPE MONSTER IS
SUMMONED ONTO THEIR FIELD.

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.432
NOW LET'S SEE
YOUR GOOD COP/BAD COP
ROUTINE TRY AND HANDCUFF

00:10:58.432 --> 00:11:00.967
THIS SWEET-SMELLING
MANEUVER OF MINE.

00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:06.940
[GROANING]

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:11.344
UHH! NOT BAD.

00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:14.815
I READ ABOUT THAT COMBO
THE FIRST TIME YOU USED IT
WHEN YOU WERE 5 YEARS OLD.

00:11:14.815 --> 00:11:15.916
HMM?

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.083
HMM.

00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:19.352
IT WAS YOUR VERY FIRST DUEL,

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:21.188
WHEN YOU LEARNED
ABOUT YOUR CURSE.

00:11:23.089 --> 00:11:25.592
YOUR POWER WAS
UNCONTROLLABLE.

00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:29.062
YOU COULDN'T STOP;
YOU WERE A DANGER
TO YOURSELF AND TO OTHERS.

00:11:29.062 --> 00:11:31.965
THEN YOUR PARENTS
SENT YOU AWAY FOR HELP,

00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:35.302
YET YOU REFUSED
TO GIVE UP THE POWER
THAT YOU HAD INSIDE YOU.

00:11:35.302 --> 00:11:37.704
I'M LEARNING
TO CONTROL IT!

00:11:37.704 --> 00:11:40.106
I WANT TO USE IT SO THAT
I CAN HELP PEOPLE!

00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:44.744
Commander Koda:
"HELP PEOPLE"?
YOU'VE CAUSED NOTHING

00:11:44.744 --> 00:11:47.647
BUT DESTRUCTION AND PAIN,
INCLUDING MY OWN!

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:49.649
YOU DON'T CARE
WHO YOUR POWER HURTS!

00:11:49.683 --> 00:11:52.018
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:55.422
INCOMPETENCE,
LIKE IGNORANCE,
IS NO EXCUSE, AKIZA.

00:11:55.422 --> 00:11:57.924
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR EXCUSES.

00:11:57.924 --> 00:12:01.261
ONCE THIS DUEL IS OVER,
I KNOW THAT YOU'LL
THANK ME FOR THIS.

00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:03.597
MY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE
SOCIETY IS SAFE,

00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.565
AND I DON'T PLAN
ON LETTING SOCIETY DOWN.

00:12:05.565 --> 00:12:07.968
I'M GOING TO SEND YOU
TO A SPECIAL FACILITY

00:12:07.968 --> 00:12:11.771
TO CURE YOU OF YOUR AFFLICTIONS
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!

00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:13.573
[SIGHS]

00:12:31.185 --> 00:12:33.421
AND NOW, TO CURE YOU!

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:35.390
I ACTIVATE MIND MONSTER!

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.659
JUST THINK OF IT
AS A GUESSING GAME.

00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:41.529
I CHOOSE
ANY MONSTER I WANT.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:44.365
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE IT,
THEN YOU LOSE HALF
ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:48.603
AND IF ALL MY RESEARCH IS RIGHT,
YOU'VE GOT BLACK ROSE DRAGON.

00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:50.605
HUH?

00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:54.976
AND I HOPE YOU'VE LEARNED
BY NOW THAT MY RESEARCH
IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:58.713
NOW WHY DON'T WE GIVE YOU
A TASTE OF YOUR OWN
MEDICINE, AKIZA?

00:12:58.713 --> 00:13:01.482
BLACK ROSE DRAGON HAS
2,400 ATTACK POINTS,

00:13:01.482 --> 00:13:04.218
WHICH MEANS YOU TAKE
1,200 POINTS IN DAMAGE.

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:07.288
IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE,
YOU'RE GONNA GET BURNED.

00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:12.326
[GROANING]

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:15.930
MC: AND THE COMMANDER RESPONDS
WITH HIS FIRST ATTACK
AGAINST THE BLACK ROSE!

00:13:17.699 --> 00:13:20.435
HOW ABOUT THAT?
1,200 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:23.237
AND I DIDN'T EVEN NEED
TO USE ANY PSYCHIC POWERS.

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:26.774
UNLIKE YOUR "SPELLS,"
I DON'T NEED TO CHEAT!

00:13:26.774 --> 00:13:31.479
NOW I SWITCH ROSE TOKEN
TO DEFENSE MODE
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:33.881
YOU'LL WISH YOU NEVER
CALLED ME A CHEAT!

00:13:36.718 --> 00:13:38.453
[THINKING]
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:41.823
I JUST WANT
A NORMAL LIFE,
BUT I CAN'T HAVE ONE.

00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:45.760
[WHIMPERING]

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.895
Akiva, thinking:
DESTRUCTION ALWAYS
FOLLOWED ME.

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:50.264
AND THE MORE I RAN,
THE MORE PEOPLE I HURT.

00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.400
MY ONLY CHOICE WAS
TO KEEP DUELING

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.003
AND HOPE THAT I'D FIND
SOMEONE WHO COULD
HELP ME, AND I DID.

00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:59.040
I AM SAYER, AND I HEAD
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.043
WE ARE A GROUP OF DUELISTS
WITH POWERS LIKE YOURS,

00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:03.444
AND WE CAN HELP YOU.

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:05.947
SAYER GAVE ME STRENGTH.

00:14:05.947 --> 00:14:09.350
AKIZA, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO, CONTACT
YOUR PSYCHIC FRIENDS?

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.786
WELL, THEY CAN'T HELP YOU.
YOU ARE ALL MINE!

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:12.820
HUH?

00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:16.791
IF WHAT
THE COMMANDER
SAID IS TRUE

00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:18.559
AND AKIZA HAS
GIFTED FRIENDS,

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:21.162
SHE MAY BE
EVEN MORE USEFUL
THAN WE THOUGHT.

00:14:21.162 --> 00:14:23.898
THERE'S RUMORS OF
A PSYCHIC SOCIETY;

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:28.569
IF AKIZA'S IN IT,
SHE COULD LEAD US TO
EVEN GREATER POWER!

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:31.072
YOU MAY KNOW ABOUT
MY FRIENDS AND MY DECK,

00:14:31.072 --> 00:14:33.307
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S REALLY INSIDE ME.

00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.943
YOU CANNOT PROFILE
SOMEONE'S HEART!

00:14:35.943 --> 00:14:38.579
AND WHILE THAT'S
SINKIN' IN,
I'M ACTIVATING THIS:

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:41.582
PHOENIXIAN SEED'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:44.285
BY SENDING THIS CARD
STRAIGHT TO
MY GRAVEYARD,

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:46.721
I CAN NOW SUMMON
MY OTHER
PHOENIXIAN MONSTER

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.422
DIRECTLY FROM MY HAND:

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:51.759
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS!

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:54.796
MC: THE BLACK ROSE'S
NEW MONSTER SPROUTS
TO THE FIELD,

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:57.698
BUT IT WON'T ESCAPE
HER BLACK GARDEN FIELD SPELL!

00:14:57.698 --> 00:14:59.901
AMARYLLIS LOSES HALF
ITS POWER,

00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.003
AND THE COMMANDER GETS
A NEW ROSE TOKEN!

00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:03.371
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS:

00:15:03.371 --> 00:15:05.773
THE ROSE FLAME TRAP
INSTANTLY ACTIVATES!

00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:08.142
IS IT ME, OR IS IT
GETTIN' HOT IN HERE?!

00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:10.111
[GROANING]

00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:12.480
COMMANDER, I DON'T NEED
PSYCHIC POWERS

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.315
TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:15:14.315 --> 00:15:17.418
AMARYLLIS, ATTACK
HIS ROSE TOKEN!

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:22.523
[GROANING]

00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:25.126
AMARYLLIS IS
AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYED,

00:15:25.126 --> 00:15:27.328
BUT ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:15:27.328 --> 00:15:29.630
I'M SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.499
THE CARD GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.734
AND YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE.

00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:38.039
NOW SURELY YOUR RESEARCH
SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
THAT THIS WAS COMING!

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:42.243
IT'LL TAKE A LOT MORE THAN
WILTING FLOWERS TO BEAT ME!

00:15:42.243 --> 00:15:43.744
MC: DON'T FORGET!

00:15:43.744 --> 00:15:45.680
DUE TO THE COMMANDER'S
AGENT OF HATRED,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.983
HE GETS BACK THE POINTS
HE LOST THIS ROUND!

00:15:48.983 --> 00:15:51.519
YOU WILL NOT
DEFEAT ME, AKIZA!

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.721
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
YOU ATTACK,

00:15:53.721 --> 00:15:57.925
I WON'T REST UNTIL I MAKE SURE
YOU NEVER HURT ANYONE AGAIN.

00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:01.295
AND ONCE I WIN,
YOU'RE GOING TO THAT
SPECIAL FACILITY!

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:04.465
AND ONCE YOU'RE THERE,
THEY WILL DISPATCH YOU
OF YOUR POWER!

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:06.767
WELL, I DON'T PLAN
ON LOSING TODAY.

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:09.770
NOW I PLAY A FACEDOWN,
BUT DON'T DRAW JUST YET

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.540
BECAUSE I CAN RE-SUMMON
PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER
AMARYLLIS

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.542
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:16.644
MC: BLACK ROSE GETS
HER MONSTER BACK,

00:16:16.644 --> 00:16:21.048
BUT THE FIELD SPELL GIVES
THE COMMANDER ANOTHER
ROSE TOKEN!

00:16:21.048 --> 00:16:24.185
WHICH MEANS MY TRAP
ACTIVATES AGAIN!

00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:28.055
MC: OUCH!
IT'S ANOTHER FIERY FINISH
FROM THE BLACK ROSE!

00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.557
[GROANING]

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:31.325
[PANTING]

00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.561
YOU'RE ASKIN'
FOR IT, AKIZA!

00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:35.396
AND NOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GET IT!

00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:39.267
I KNEW YOU'D FILL MY FIELD
WITH ROSE TOKENS.
IT'S WHAT I WANTED!

00:16:39.267 --> 00:16:42.536
NOW I CAN SACRIFICE THEM
TO SUMMON MY OWN MONSTER:

00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:44.505
THE MAD PROFILER!

00:16:44.505 --> 00:16:48.476
Computer: MAD PROFILER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY ALLOWS YOU
TO SEND ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:52.179
TO THE GRAVEYARD TO REMOVE
THE SAME TYPE OF CARD
ON THE FIELD FROM PLAY.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.749
I'M SURE YOU NOTICE
THE PROFESSIONAL
RESEMBLANCE,

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:56.851
SINCE WE'RE BOTH
IN THE SAME BUSINESS
OF MAKING SURE

00:16:56.851 --> 00:16:59.387
YOU NEVER HOLD
A DUELING DECK
AGAIN!

00:16:59.387 --> 00:17:01.589
MC: WHAT A MOVE!
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:17:01.589 --> 00:17:04.659
THE MAD PROFILER ESCAPES
BLACK ROSE'S FIELD SPELL!

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:07.828
BUT THIS TIME, THE TOKEN'S
ON AKIZA'S SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:17:07.828 --> 00:17:10.831
[THINKING]
YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING
I KNEW YOU WOULD, AKIZA.

00:17:10.831 --> 00:17:14.135
I GOT A LITTLE SINGED
IN THE PROCESS,
BUT VENGEANCE IS MINE!

00:17:14.135 --> 00:17:17.038
NOW I'LL TAP INTO
MY MAD PROFILER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:17:17.038 --> 00:17:20.441
SO, BY SENDING A SPELL CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:23.010
I CAN REMOVE ANY OTHER
SPELL CARD FROM THE GAME,

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.479
AND I'VE GOT JUST
THE ONE IN MIND!

00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:29.583
HMM?

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:32.053
HE GOT RID OF
THE BLACK GARDEN
FIELD SPELL!

00:17:32.053 --> 00:17:33.688
AND NOW ALL THE MONSTERS
WILL GET BACK

00:17:33.688 --> 00:17:35.856
THEIR ATTACK POINTS
THAT WERE CUT IN HALF!

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:40.027
MY PROFILER CAN WORK
WITH MORE CARDS
THAN JUST SPELLS!

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:42.596
I CAN SEND A MONSTER CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:17:42.596 --> 00:17:46.934
TO DESTROY ANY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS!

00:17:46.934 --> 00:17:49.170
HA! THAT EVENS THINGS UP!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.638
NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE BATTLE?

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:52.473
MAD PROFILER, ATTACK!

00:17:52.473 --> 00:17:56.444
TAKE OUT HER ROSE TOKEN
WITH MAD DASH DESTRUCTION!

00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:00.281
[GROANING]

00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:06.654
NOW THAT THAT TOKEN
IS OUT OF THE WAY,

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:08.656
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO END THIS DUEL

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:11.292
AND PUT YOU AWAY FOR GOOD!

00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:28.189
THE BLACK ROSE
CAN'T KEEP THIS UP
FOR LONG.

00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:29.590
IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.592
BEFORE THE COMMANDER
PUSHES THIS GIRL

00:18:31.592 --> 00:18:34.695
TO HER LIMITS
AND ACTIVATES
HER SIGNER POWER!

00:18:34.695 --> 00:18:36.764
NEXT UP, I PLAY
MY EQUIP SPELL!

00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:39.934
AND IT GOES BY THE NAME
DESTRUCTION INSURANCE!

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:42.169
[GIGGLING]

00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:43.838
I HEARD ABOUT
THAT NEW CARD.

00:18:43.838 --> 00:18:45.539
ONCE YOU EQUIP IT
TO A MONSTER,

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:47.007
IF YOUR OPPONENT
DESTROYS IT,

00:18:47.007 --> 00:18:49.043
THEY LOSE HALF
ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:49.043 --> 00:18:51.679
LOOKS LIKE
THE COMMANDER GOT
THE PROTOTYPE.

00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:54.415
AND WITH BLACK ROSE
DOWN TO HER LAST FEW
ATTACK POINTS,

00:18:54.415 --> 00:18:57.852
IF SHE TAKES OUT
MAD PROFILER, SHE TAKES
HERSELF OUT AS WELL.

00:18:57.852 --> 00:19:00.154
MAGIC OR NOT,
THAT GIRL IS GONE.

00:19:00.154 --> 00:19:04.258
NOW I ACTIVATE
A SECOND EQUIP SPELL:
LIGHTLOW PROTECTION!

00:19:04.258 --> 00:19:06.060
[GIGGLING]

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.162
WHOA, ANOTHER
PROTECTION SPELL.

00:19:08.162 --> 00:19:10.364
HIS CARD'S TOTALLY SAFE.

00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:12.499
NOW, IF SHE CHANGES
ITS ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:15.069
LIKE WITH
THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF
ONE OF HER OTHER CARDS,

00:19:15.069 --> 00:19:16.871
THEN THAT CARD IS
DESTROYED!

00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:20.507
NOT EVEN HER
BLACK ROSE DRAGON CAN
SAVE HER NOW, YUSEI.

00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:25.679
DON'T BE SO SURE, TANNER.

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:27.514
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.150
AND I SUMMON
NIGHT ROSE KNIGHT!

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.989
MY COMBO WON'T BE
A SURPRISE.

00:19:34.989 --> 00:19:36.991
AFTER ALL, AREN'T YOU
THE "PROFILER"

00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:39.326
WHO SPENT THE LAST
FEW YEARS STUDYING ME?!

00:19:39.326 --> 00:19:42.496
INSTEAD OF OFFERING
TO HELP, YOU TREAT ME
LIKE A MONSTER,

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:45.666
SO ALL I CAN DO IS
ANSWER WITH A MONSTER
OF MY OWN.

00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:48.335
I COMBINE MY KNIGHT
WITH TWO ROSE TOKENS

00:19:48.335 --> 00:19:51.839
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:19:55.209 --> 00:19:56.710
[GROANING]

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.379
THIS IS IT!

00:20:01.982 --> 00:20:04.852
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
THAT WILL SURPRISE ME.

00:20:04.852 --> 00:20:07.187
I KNOW YOUR EACH
AND EVERY MOVE.

00:20:07.187 --> 00:20:10.491
JUST FACE IT, BLACK ROSE!
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:20:14.628 --> 00:20:16.764
IT'S ABOUT MORE
THAN WINNING;

00:20:16.764 --> 00:20:19.333
IT'S ABOUT FINDING
YOUR PLACE IN THE WORLD,

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:21.602
AND I KNOW
WHERE I BELONG.

00:20:21.602 --> 00:20:23.904
I'M THROUGH HIDING
BEHIND A MASK!

00:20:23.904 --> 00:20:27.241
I'M GOING TO SHOW
EVERYONE IN THIS ARENA
MY TRUE POWERS

00:20:27.241 --> 00:20:29.443
AND WIN THIS DUEL!

00:20:29.443 --> 00:20:32.379
GOOD LUCK, BECAUSE AS LONG
AS I'VE GOT MY EQUIP SPELLS

00:20:32.379 --> 00:20:35.549
AND LINE-UP OF MONSTERS,
I'M UNTOUCHABLE!

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:36.884
MC: THE COMMANDER'S RIGHT!

00:20:36.884 --> 00:20:39.019
PSYCHIC? WITCH?
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:41.088
THE BLACK ROSE
CAN'T GET TO HIM!

00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:43.757
WHAT WILL SHE DO?

00:20:43.757 --> 00:20:47.461
I ACTIVATE
BLACK ROSE DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:47.461 --> 00:20:49.129
IF I TAKE
A PLANT-TYPE MONSTER

00:20:49.129 --> 00:20:51.332
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
AND REMOVE IT
FROM PLAY,

00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:54.535
THEN YOUR MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS GO
TO ZERO!

00:21:00.474 --> 00:21:02.309
RRR!

00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:04.511
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
WAITING FOR!

00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.281
NOW MY EQUIP SPELL
ACTIVATES!

00:21:07.281 --> 00:21:10.117
AND BECAUSE YOU USED
BLACK ROSE DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:21:10.117 --> 00:21:14.188
MY LIGHTLOW PROTECTION
AUTOMATICALLY DESTROYS IT!

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.529
SHE'S A SIGNER!

00:21:25.299 --> 00:21:28.335
WE'VE CAPTURED HER ENER-D!
I CAN PAY MY STUDENT LOAN!

00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:31.605
EXCELLENT.
3 DOWN AND ONLY
TWO MORE TO GO.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.810
A NICE SPELL,
BUT I STILL HAVE
MY TRAP CARD:

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.613
ROSE CURSE!

00:21:39.613 --> 00:21:42.282
YOU SPENT SO MUCH TIME
STUDYING MY PAST

00:21:42.282 --> 00:21:45.486
THAT YOU NEVER EVEN
STOPPED TO LOOK AT
THE PERSON I'VE BECOME.

00:21:45.486 --> 00:21:47.221
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
YOUR LIFE POINTS ARE

00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:50.224
NOW GOING TO SUFFER FOR
YOUR NARROW-MINDEDNESS.

00:21:50.224 --> 00:21:52.259
MY ROSE CURSE IS
A NEW CARD,

00:21:52.259 --> 00:21:54.528
ONE YOU COULD
NEVER PROFILE.

00:21:54.528 --> 00:21:55.763
I'M SORRY!

00:21:55.763 --> 00:21:58.298
BUT YOU BROUGHT THIS
UPON YOURSELF!

00:21:58.298 --> 00:22:00.801
[SCREAMING]

00:22:00.801 --> 00:22:02.636
[GROANING]

00:22:07.374 --> 00:22:11.779
MC: IT'S OVER!
THE BLACK ROSE IS OUR WINNER!

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:13.680
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.452
SHE'LL MOVE ON TO THE FINALS
TO TAKE ON YUSEI FUDO!

00:22:25.292 --> 00:22:27.327
ANOTHER FINE VICTORY.

00:22:27.327 --> 00:22:28.962
YOU HAVE GROWN.

00:22:28.962 --> 00:22:30.931
YOU'RE LEARNING
TO CONTROL YOUR POWERS,

00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:33.333
AND I HOPE YOU CAN DO
THE SAME AGAINST YUSEI.

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:38.038
I HAVE A FEELING THAT HE
WILL BE THE BIGGEST TEST
THAT YOU HAVE EVER FACED.

00:22:40.274 --> 00:22:43.610
I CAN'T SAY
THAT I ENVY YOU, YUSEI.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.047
THAT BLACK ROSE IS
A ONE-WOMAN WRECKING
MACHINE! HUH!

00:22:47.047 --> 00:22:49.817
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
TONIGHT'S MATCH MIGHT BE
MY MOST DANGEROUS DUEL YET.
