800 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:24.023
I END MY TURN.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:25.525
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.760
THAT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
I LOST MY LIFE POINTS.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.463
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
DRAINED MY ENERGY.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.268
[THINKING]
NO, I CAN'T LET IT
GET TO ME.

00:10:35.268 --> 00:10:39.139
I HAVE TO WIN THIS DUEL.
I HAVE TO SAVE LUNA!

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.375
IT'S MY TURN! HERE GOES!

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:43.576
OH!

00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:45.545
[THINKING]
I GOTTA GET THIS GUY
OUT ON THE FIELD.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.147
I'LL SEND
MORPHTRONIC DATATRON

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:48.648
TO THE GRAVEYARD
TO SUMMON--

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.782
OH, BY THE WAY,

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.384
SINCE THE CARD
I SENT TO THE GRAVE
ON MY TURN

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.486
WAS MIRROR PRISON,

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:56.456
THE MONSTER YOU SUMMON NOW
ISN'T ALLOWED TO ATTACK

00:10:56.456 --> 00:10:59.726
UNLESS IT'S THE SAME TYPE
OF MONSTER AS THE ONE
YOU SACRIFICE.

00:10:59.726 --> 00:11:00.860
THAT IS, OF COURSE,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.496
IF THE MONSTER
IS A MACHINE OR ZOMBIE-TYPE.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.131
GOOD, BECAUSE IT
JUST SO HAPPENS

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.735
THAT THE MONSTER
I'M SUMMONING
IS A MACHINE!

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:12.038
COME ON OUT,
MORPHTRONIC SCOPEN!

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.640
YOU HAVE A MACHINE DECK?!

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.041
I SURE DO!

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.143
AND IT'S ABOUT TO GO
INTO HIGH GEAR ON YOU

00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:19.445
'CAUSE DUE TO SCOPEN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:23.416
I CAN NOW SUMMON
THE LEVEL 4 MORPHTRONIC
VIDEON FROM MY HAND!

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:29.923
AND NOW I'LL TUNE
MORPHTRONIC VIDEON
WITH MORPHTRONIC SCOPEN

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:31.824
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:34.194
A MONSTER WITH SOME
MAJOR MOTOR--

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:38.031
A BEAST BUILT OUT OF
PURE BRAWN!

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.666
HERE HE IS!

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:42.202
THE POWER TOOL DRAGON!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.905
WOW. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.173
BUT IT WON'T BE ENOUGH
TO GET PAST ME,

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:49.576
YOU FOUL SPIRIT
OF THE DARK!

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.611
I'M NOT
SOME FOUL SPIRIT!

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.813
AND MY DRAGON
WILL GET PAST YOU!

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:56.549
'CAUSE HIS ABILITY
LETS ME ADD ONE
RANDOM EQUIP SPELL

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.984
TO MY HAND!

00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.920
NEXT I'LL SEND
MORPHTRONIC CORD
TO MY GRAVEYARD

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.722
AND USE THE EQUIP SPELL
I JUST DREW!

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.192
BREAK! DRAW! WITH
MY POWER TOOL DRAGON!

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:07.527
HUH?

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:09.495
AAH!

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.497
[ENGINE ROARING]

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.168
YOU'RE TOUGH TO FIND.

00:12:15.168 --> 00:12:16.169
YUSEI!

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:18.771
WHAT'S THIS,
ANOTHER WICKED SPIRIT?

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:20.406
WHAT'S GOING ON, LEO?

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:22.041
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME, YUSEI.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.343
YOU NEED TO HELP
LUNA.

00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:25.678
THIS KID HAS HER
TRAPPED
IN THAT HOUSE!

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.513
TRAPPED?!

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:30.750
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
SHE'S SAFE FROM YOU TWO!

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.452
HMM!

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:33.553
US?

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:36.022
HELLO!
I'M HER BROTHER,
AND HE'S HER FRIEND!

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:37.557
NOW, GO,
POWER TOOL DRAGON,

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:40.727
AND TAKE DOWN
THAT HOLLOW SPIRIT!

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.931
[GROANING]

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.269
OH! AAH!

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.274
LUNA!

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.909
YUSEI?!

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.245
AND NOW I ACTIVATE
THE EFFECT OF
BREAK! DRAW!

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.981
SINCE POWER TOOL DRAGON
DESTROYED YOUR MONSTER,

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.685
I GET TO DRAW ONE CARD!

00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:06.919
THAT WAS FOOLISH!

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.855
I WARNED YOU NOT TO
ENTER THE HOUSE,

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:10.690
BUT YOU DIDN'T LISTEN!

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.292
NOW YOU WILL PAY!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.694
[GROWL]

00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:16.229
WHOA!

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:17.964
LEO?

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.167
WHAT'S THIS?

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.402
TWO CHILDREN.

00:13:22.402 --> 00:13:24.170
JUST LIKE IN CROW'S STORY.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.738
THEY WERE LIVING IN
A HOUSE IN THE FOREST

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:29.642
UNTIL ONE DAY THE WICKED SPIRITS
CAME AND SNATCHED THEM!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.344
THEY WERE THE FIRST
TO DISAPPEAR.

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:32.879
ONLY HOW CAN THEY HAVE
DISAPPEARED

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:34.547
IF THEY'RE STILL HERE?

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.216
OR AT LEAST,
IF ONE OF THEM IS.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:41.020
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE,
UNLESS...

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.723
[GRUNTING]

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:46.759
THIS KID'S REALLY
STARTING TO GIVE ME
THE CREEPS!

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:49.862
WELL, THEN, THAT'S
ALL THE MORE REASON
FOR ME TO STOP HIM.

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:52.632
I WON'T LET HIM
OR HIS WEIRD POWERS
HURT LUNA!

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:55.234
YOU SHOULD BE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT YOURSELF RIGHT NOW

00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:57.303
BECAUSE WHEN HOLLOW SPIRIT
IS SENT TO THE GRAVE,

00:13:57.303 --> 00:13:58.304
A NEW PORTAL OPENS

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:01.307
AND HOLLOW GHOST
IS RELEASED!

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:11.284
2,600 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:12.285
I'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:14.220
KEEPING HOLLOW SPIRIT
AROUND!

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.588
[SIGH]

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.056
[THINKING]
CALM DOWN, LEO.

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:20.426
YOU JUST HAVE
TO REMEMBER WHAT'S
ON THE LINE HERE.

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:21.494
LEO!

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:23.596
Girl: I KNOW,
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:27.100
HE'S JUST SO PROTECTIVE,
AND IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.303
OH, WELL. MAYBE THIS TIME,
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:33.740
NO WAY. ARE YOU...?

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.976
AFTER ALL,
HE WOULD LOVE YOU ALL
SO MUCH!

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.314
IT IS YOU.
YOU'RE CLAIRE.

00:14:41.314 --> 00:14:43.549
BUT WHO IS IT
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.418
WHY, THE SPIRITS,
OF COURSE!

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:46.886
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS!

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.260
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN!

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.295
YOU SHOULD GIVE UP NOW,
WICKED SPIRIT.

00:14:56.295 --> 00:14:58.965
I WON'T LET YOU
TAKE ME AND MY SISTER!

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:01.834
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU COME AND TRY!

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.436
[THINKING]
HE'S DONE THIS BEFORE?

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:05.905
IT'S MY TURN NOW!
HA!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.907
AND FIRST,
I'LL HAVE MY HOLLOW GHOST

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.910
ATTACK YOUR
POWER TOOL DRAGON!

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:15.782
FINE!
YOU CAN ATTACK,

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:16.916
BUT YA CAN'T DESTROY!

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.085
'CAUSE BY SENDING
BREAK! DRAW!
TO THE GRAVE,

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.587
MY DRAGON SURVIVES
FOR ANOTHER TURN!

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.656
HE MAY,
BUT YOUR LIFE POINTS WON'T!

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.491
I PLAY MY GHOST'S ABILITY!

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.160
WHEN A CARD
IS SENT TO THE GRAVE,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.395
YOU TAKE 600 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.931
UNH!

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.100
THEN, DUE TO CIRCLES OF LIFE
AND TERROR,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.402
I SEND TWO MORE CARDS
TO THE GRAVE:

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:38.805
A SPELL AND A MONSTER.

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:40.907
AND HOLLOW GHOST'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES AGAIN,

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:42.942
GIVING YOU
1,200 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.043
AAH!

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:45.344
YOU'RE FINISHED, SPIRIT!

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:05.598
SAVE ME, PLEASE.

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:06.699
THOSE VOICES--

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:09.902
THEY'RE COMING
FROM IN HERE.

00:16:09.902 --> 00:16:11.037
HELP ME.

00:16:11.037 --> 00:16:12.672
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:13.673
I'M TRAPPED.

00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:14.874
OH, MAN!

00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:17.076
THESE MUST BE THE VICTIMS
OF THE WICKED SPIRITS,

00:16:17.076 --> 00:16:18.444
BUT THAT MEANS THAT...

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:21.547
YOUR TURN NOW,
IF YOU DARE.

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.549

WHICH IS WHY ONE WAY
OR ANOTHER,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.803
HERE GOES! I DRAW!

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:46.939
YES!

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:48.674

OF THESE CIRCLES

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.443

MORPHTRONIC IMPACT RETURN
IS A TRAP CARD

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:06.092
ON YOUR OPPONENTS' FIELD

ONE MORPHTRONIC

YEAH, BUT I'M NOT
SO SURE THAT SHE IS.

WHAT THIS MEANS?!

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.600
BAD MOVE!

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.802
SINCE YOU SENT MY CIRCLES
TO THE GRAVE,

00:17:49.802 --> 00:17:53.406
YOU'LL NOW FEEL THE WRATH
OF MY HOLLOW GHOST'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

[GROANING]

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.247

NOW ONE
RANDOM EQUIP SPELL
IN MY DECK

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:05.818
IS ADDED TO MY HAND.

CAN HELP LUNA!

I EQUIP POWER PICKAXE
TO MY DRAGON.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.096
NOW I CAN REMOVE
A MONSTER WHOSE LEVEL

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.831
IS LESS THAN
MY POWER TOOL DRAGON'S

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:21.233
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD
AND FROM PLAY!

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:24.170
SO I REMOVE HOLLOW SPIRIT!

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.439
AND SINCE HOLLOW SPIRIT
IS NOW GONE,

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.674
SO ARE HOLLOW GHOST'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.378
[GASP]

00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:34.981
AND NOW POWER TOOL
DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS
INCREASE

00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.682
BY HALF
THE ATTACK POINTS
OF THE MONSTER

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.618
THAT WAS REMOVED
FROM PLAY!

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.852
ALL RIGHT!

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:43.589
NOW, POWER TOOL DRAGON,
ATTACK HOLLOW GHOST!

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.292
SUPER-CHARGED SLICE!

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.632
AAH!

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.437
OH, NO!

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.206
I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH
TO PROTECT CLAIRE

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:01.874
FROM THE WICKED SPIRITS.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:02.875
Luna: THEY'RE NOT WICKED!

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.110
HUH?

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.646
SIS!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.214
LEO!

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:10.116
Claire: HALEY!

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:12.952
Haley: CLAIRE!
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN,
THE SPIRITS AREN'T WICKED?

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:14.153
THEY KEEP COMING FOR US,

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.922
TRYING TO TAKE US
SO THEY CAN MAKE US
LIKE THEM!

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:20.059
BROTHER,
THEY MADE US LIKE THEM
A LONG TIME AGO.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:23.663
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT I REALIZED IT
AND YOU DIDN'T.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:26.666
THEN WHO ARE THEY?!

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:27.667
LEO!

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:28.934
LUNA,
ARE YOU OK?

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.803
YEAH! YOU SAVED ME.

00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:31.837
OF COURSE!

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:32.905
I'M SO CONFUSED.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.945
HALEY, YOU'VE BEEN
SO FOCUSED
ON PROTECTING ME,

00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:43.082
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ACCEPT REALITY.

00:19:43.082 --> 00:19:46.152
YOU'VE BEEN IN LIMBO

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:47.687
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:51.624
I THINK, BUT WHY
DID THE SPIRITS TAKE US?!

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:54.994
'CAUSE THEY WANTED
TWO FUN KIDS
TO PLAY WITH!

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.530
LUNA, LEO,

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.599
IS THERE ANY WAY
THE TWO OF YOU WILL EVER
BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME?

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.767
OF COURSE!

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.169
EVERYTHING YOU DID,

00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:05.571
YOU DID BECAUSE
YOU WERE TRYING TO KEEP
YOUR KID SISTER SAFE,

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.106
RIGHT?

00:20:07.106 --> 00:20:10.109
BUT WHEN YOU STARTED
TO LOSE, THIS APPEARED.

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:11.110
IT'S WHAT
MADE IT POSSIBLE

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.179
FOR YOUR SISTER
TO APPEAR

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:14.714
AND YOU TO HAVE CLOSURE.

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:16.916
NOW, THEN, READY?

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.351
YES.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:21.454
HEY, THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:25.257
NO PROB.
YOU'RE ONE
GREAT DUELIST!

00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:38.971
Leo: WHOA!
WHERE DID THEY GO?

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.006
WHERE'S THE HOUSE
GOING?!

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.675
AND WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.910
PEOPLE THAT HALEY
BEAT IN DUELS.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.579
YOU SEE,
THE STORIES WERE TRUE,

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:48.514
THERE WAS A WICKED SPIRIT,

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:51.016
BUT WICKED ONLY
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER.

00:20:51.016 --> 00:20:53.953
HALEY WAS THE ONE
DOING ALL THE SNATCHING.

00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:55.855
ALL THE REAL FOREST
SPIRITS WANTED

00:20:55.855 --> 00:20:57.656
WERE TWO KIDS
TO PLAY WITH.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.825
THEY DIDN'T MEAN
ANY HARM WHATSOEVER.

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:02.428
SO THEN HALEY
AND CLAIRE CAN COME BACK
TO THIS WORLD

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.963
ANYTIME THEY WANT TO?

00:21:03.963 --> 00:21:06.265
THEY'RE NOT STUCK
IN SOME SUPER SCARY
SPIRIT WORLD

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.500
FROM HERE ON OUT?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.634
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:09.935
Yusei: HEY, WHO KNOWS,

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.937
MAYBE THEY'LL INVITE US UP
TO COME PLAY SOMETIME!

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.405
Leo: YEAH, THAT
WOULD BE AWESOME!

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:16.408
Luna: WELL, WELL,
LOOKS WHO'S FINALLY
NOT AFRAID ANYMORE.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.077
AFRAID? I WAS
NEVER AFRAID!
[CAT MEOWS]

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:19.678
HEY, WHAT WAS THAT?
