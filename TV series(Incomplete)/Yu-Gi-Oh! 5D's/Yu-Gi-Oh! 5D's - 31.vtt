STILL FIGHTING
THE GOOD FIGHT.

00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:31.224
ROBBING THE RICH TO FEED

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:33.693
SO I SEE SECTOR SECURITY

00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:36.196
YEAH, WELL.

YEAH! FINISHED HER
LAST YEAR.

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.869

00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:14.401
HEY, CROW... WHY

00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:17.470

00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:23.310
TRYING TO ROUND
UP FOLLOWERS.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.046
I HEAR THEY'RE
GATHERING EVERYONE DEEP
WITHIN THE SATELLITE.

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:27.814

00:02:52.332 --> 00:02:54.000

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.179
YOU BEAT ME.

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.214
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DID IT, YUSEI,

00:03:08.214 --> 00:03:10.517
BUT YOU'RE
THE CHAMP NOW.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.155
HOW COULD I LOSE
TO HIM TWICE?

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:17.023
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE
WITH JACK ATLAS

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:19.426
RIGHT NOW, THE SAME JACK
ATLAS THAT EVERY OTHER

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:20.994
REPORTER IS RUNNING
AROUND THE CITY LOOKING FOR,

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:23.430
AND THAT YOU
HAVEN'T GOTTEN
AN INTERVIEW YET?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.498
NOT EVEN A JUICY
SOUND BITE OR SOMETHING?

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:27.300
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.969
THAT INTERVIEW IS
THE ONE THING STANDING

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.805
BETWEEN YOU
AND A LIFETIME
OF MAKING COPIES.

00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:35.375
CARLY, NO MORE CHANCES,
GET THAT INTERVIEW
OR WE'RE DONE!

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.911
AAH! OH!

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:39.212
JACK THINKS I'M
HELPING HIM,

00:03:39.212 --> 00:03:41.281
BUT IF I TELL HIM I'M JUST
SOME WANNABE REPORTER

00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:43.883
LOOKING FOR A CAREER BOOST,
HE'LL LEAVE.

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:46.252
BUT THEN AGAIN,
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:47.454
I'M INTERVIEWING HIM.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:49.589
IT COULD JUST BE
A CONVERSATION.

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:55.662
HEY, UH, DO YOU
WANNA TALK ABOUT...

00:03:55.662 --> 00:03:58.965
OHH! JACK?

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:01.835
AAH! HE SNUCK OUT
THE WINDOW!!

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:04.637
[THINKING]
UNBELIEVABLE, BEFORE
YESTERDAY I'D'VE HAD

00:04:04.637 --> 00:04:06.706
100 PEOPLE ASKING
FOR AUTOGRAPHS,

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:08.708
AND TODAY, NOTHING.

00:04:15.615 --> 00:04:17.217
Blister:
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:19.252
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A DUEL RUNNER.

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:20.653
SECTOR SECURITY?

00:04:23.623 --> 00:04:25.358
HMM.

HEY, THERE, YUSEI!

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.801
YUSEI?
SERIOUSLY?

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.936
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:38.505
HE-E-EY!

00:04:38.505 --> 00:04:39.939
THE CRAZIEST THING
HAPPENED TO US

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.142
LAST WEEK, YUSEI,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:44.310
WELL NOW THAT I'M BACK
HERE IN THE SATELLITE,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.546
I'M GOING TO SET
THINGS STRAIGHT!

00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:05.530
BLISTER, THANKS

WITH MY FRIENDS.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.300
NO WORRIES, YUSEI.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.569
SO, UH... IS THIS
AN EXCLUSIVE CLUB
OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.604
HEY, CROW!
HEY, CROW!

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.605
I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE YOU

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:15.073
WITH THE HELMET
AND BIKE.

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:17.742
YEAH, YUSEI'S NOT
THE ONLY TURBO-CHARGED
DUEL RUNNER

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:19.878
IN SATELLITE ANYMORE.
RIGHT?

00:05:19.878 --> 00:05:21.046
THIS IS SECTOR SECURITY!

00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:24.616
I.D. NUMBER AWX 74098!
GIVE YOURSELF UP.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.018
HEH! AND HE'S
NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH A KNACK

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:29.287
FOR TICKING OFF
SECTOR SECURITY,

00:05:32.757 --> 00:05:35.193
Nervin: THEY'RE TRYING
TO SMOKE US OUT!?

00:05:35.193 --> 00:05:36.661
WE NEED TO
SPLIT UP.

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.964
LET'S MEET AT
THE DAEDALUS BRIDGE
IN TWO HOURS.

00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.899
THAT'S WHERE
MY HIDEOUT IS.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:41.967
Security: COME ON, CROW.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.802
DON'T MAKE
THIS DIFFICULT.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:45.437
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
THIS TIME.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.477
THERE HE GOES!

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.846
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HIDE FROM OUR
NEW PURSUIT BOT!

00:05:56.247 --> 00:05:58.817
WOW! THEY GOT
NEW TOYS!

00:06:02.754 --> 00:06:04.422
THIS THING'S GONNA
BE TOUGH TO SHAKE.

00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:05.490
Yusei: NEED SOME HELP?

00:06:08.026 --> 00:06:09.394
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.796
SOMEONE HAS TO
BABY-SIT YOU, CROW.

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:16.001
LOOK! THAT'S
YUSEI FUDO.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.736
WHAT IS HE DOING BACK

00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:20.705
WHO CARES, HE'S AIDING

LET'S GET 'EM!
RIGHT!

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:26.878
THEY CAN'T OUTRUN OUR
SPEED WORLD FIELD SPELL.

00:06:26.878 --> 00:06:29.180
ACTIVATE IT!

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.684
Computer: OVERRIDING
SUSPECT'S DUEL RUNNER.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:37.255
DUEL MODE ENGAGED.
AUTOPILOT ENGAGED.

00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:40.792
THEY CAN CATCH US BOTH
IN THE SPEED WORLD FIELD
AT THE SAME TIME?

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:43.661
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE
SINCE YOU HAD SECTOR
SECURITY ON YOUR TAIL,

00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.030
HASN'T IT, BUDDY?

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.264
IT'S LIKE A TAG DUEL.

00:06:46.264 --> 00:06:48.733
WHADDYA SAY? ARE YOU UP
FOR THIS OR WHAT?

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.535

All: LET'S DUEL!

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.210
WHERE COULD
HE HAVE GONE? EHRR.

00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:03.014
WHAT'S THIS?

00:07:03.014 --> 00:07:04.249
Computer: PLEASE SWIPE
METRO PASS.

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:06.451
WHAT'S A METRO PASS?

00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:09.054
HEY, ISN'T THAT
JACK ATLAS
OVER THERE?

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.355
IT SURE LOOKS LIKE HIM.

00:07:10.355 --> 00:07:12.791
HEY, JACK, YOU CAN'T
JUST WALK THROUGH!

00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:15.026
DON'T YOU KNOW HOW
TO RIDE THE METRORAIL?

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:16.961
GUESS HE'S NOT USED
TO TECHNOLOGY.

00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:18.730
MAYBE HE IS
FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.098
HUH?

00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:21.833
NO, NO, NOTHING
TO SEE HERE,
THIS ISN'T JACK.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:23.468
IT'S MY COUSIN RALPH,
HE JUST LOOKS LIKE JACK,

00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:24.569
HE'S NEW HERE,
SO PLEASE DON'T
UPSET HIM.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.337
WHO'S RALPH?!

00:07:26.337 --> 00:07:29.741
COME ON, RALPH,
TIME TO GO HOME!

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:30.975
ARE YOU BONKERS?!

00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:32.477
DON'T YOU KNOW THE PRESS
IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:34.679
IF YOU GET SPOTTED,
YOU'RE GONNA GET MOBBED!

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:36.681
AND YOU HAVEN'T
RECOVERED YET.

00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.416
YOU NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE HOTEL

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.151
AND LAY LOW
FOR A LITTLE WHILE!

00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.687
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF,
NOW GO AWAY.

00:07:42.687 --> 00:07:44.422
ERR!

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:46.524
[THINKING]
IF I LOSE JACK,
I LOSE MY SCOOP.

00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:48.993
COME ON, CARLY.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:07:48.993 --> 00:07:50.295
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!!

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.296
I SAVED YOU
AND I HELPED YOU

00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:52.730
AND NOW YOU'RE JUST
GONNA WALK AWAY,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.899
THAT'S HOW YOU
SHOW GRATITUDE?

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.035
I UNDERSTAND YOU NOW,
JACK ATLAS.

00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:59.003
YOU'RE JUST A SPOILED,
PAMPERED JERK

00:07:59.003 --> 00:08:02.140
WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO GET ON A METRORAIL
BY HIMSELF.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.575
HEY, EVERYBODY!

00:08:03.575 --> 00:08:06.578
EVERYBODY,
LOOK OVER THERE,
CHECK IT OUT, THE...

00:08:06.578 --> 00:08:09.747
ALRIGHT, I'LL HANG
OUT WITH YOU IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

00:08:09.747 --> 00:08:11.449
I'LL PLAY YOUR
LITTLE GAME,

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.251
BUT I'LL DO IT
WITH DIGNITY!

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:17.956
THAT OUTFIT
IS PERFECT.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.158
NOBODY WILL KNOW
IT'S YOU UNDER THERE.

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:22.026
I LOOK LIKE
A DISCOTHEQUE REJECT.

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:23.361
I FEEL ABSURD.

00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.029
BOY, YOU ARE
SO HIGH STRUNG.

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:27.699
YOU NEED TO JUST WIND
DOWN AND HAVE
SOME FUN, JACK.

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:30.168
I HATE FUN.

00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:32.070
[THINKING]
I'VE GOTTA GET HIM
TO OPEN UP TO ME.

00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:33.738
WE NEED TO GO DO
SOMETHING THAT
FRIENDS

00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:35.039
WOULD DO TOGETHER.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.074
AH! GOT IT!

00:08:36.074 --> 00:08:37.509
JACK, YOU NEED TO...

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:39.310
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.179
I DUNNO, BUT...
FOR SOME REASON,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.447
I DON'T TRUST HER.

00:08:42.447 --> 00:08:43.681
LET'S KEEP AN EYE
ON 'EM TO SEE

00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:45.750
IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT SHE'S UP TO.

00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:55.059
I'VE GOT
THE FIRST MOVE.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.662
AND I SUMMON OUT
GATE BLOCKER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:01.099
THESE SECTOR SECURITY
GOONS ALWAYS START
WITH GATE BLOCKER.

00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:03.101
Security A: WELL HOW'S
THIS FOR SOME VARIETY,

00:09:03.101 --> 00:09:08.173
I RELEASE GATE BLOCKER
TO SUMMON GATE BLOCKER 2
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.608
Computer: WHEN THE MONSTER CARD
GATE BLOCKER 2 IS

00:09:10.608 --> 00:09:13.311
FACE UP ON THE FIELD
YOUR OPPONENT CANNOT GAIN

00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:16.080
SPEED COUNTERS
DURING THEIR STANDBY PHASE.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.850
NEXT, I PLACE THREE
CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.186
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GUYS
GOT AN UPGRADE.

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.487
MY MOVE.

00:09:22.487 --> 00:09:24.756
HOLD UP... I ACTIVATE
FULL THROTTLE!

00:09:24.756 --> 00:09:26.758
WITH HIS IN PLAY,
SPEED WORLD GIVES ME

00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:28.393
ONE EXTRA
SPEED COUNTER!

00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:31.563
AND WITH GATE BLOCKER
2'S SPECIAL ABILITY
IN EFFECT,

00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:33.965
THERE'S NO CHANCE
YOU'LL EVER ESCAPE!

00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.039
I GUESS THEY'RE TRYING
TO STOP US FROM USING
SPEED SPELLS.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.941
WELL, IF THESE JOKERS
DIDN'T HAVE SOME
KINDA SKILLS,

00:09:42.941 --> 00:09:44.676
THIS WOULDN'T BE FUN.

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:46.611
NOW I'M PLAYING
THE TRAP CARD
SPEED EDGE!

00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:48.279
DURING EACH
STANDBY PHASE,

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:49.914
FOR EVERY
SPEED COUNTER
THAT I HAVE

00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:52.884
AND YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL TAKE 300
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.852
AND RIGHT NOW,
THE DIFFERENCE IS TWO.

00:09:54.852 --> 00:09:58.523
SO YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A 600 POINT HIT!

00:09:58.523 --> 00:10:00.291
CROW, ARE YOU OKAY?

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.793
IT TAKES MORE THAN
A LITTLE TICKLE

00:10:01.793 --> 00:10:04.395
TO RATTLE THIS GUY.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:05.830
AND I'LL PROVE IT
BY SUMMONING

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.034
BLACKWING BORA THE SPEAR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:10.034 --> 00:10:11.502
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY ABOUT BIRDS

00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:14.072
OF A FEATHER
FLOCKING TOGETHER?

00:10:14.105 --> 00:10:16.474
WELL, I CAN SUMMON
BLACKWING GALE
THE WHIRLWIND

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:17.976
FROM MY HAND
WHEN I HAVE ANOTHER

00:10:17.976 --> 00:10:20.011
BLACKWING MONSTER
ON MY FIELD.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.616
AND ONCE A TURN,
GALE THE WHIRLWIND

00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:27.619
CAN SLICE YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK AND DEFENSE
POINTS IN HALF!

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:30.855
Security A:
WELL THEN I GUESS
I'LL COUNTER

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:32.523
WITH
DEFENDER'S MIND!

00:10:32.523 --> 00:10:35.026
Computer DEFENDER'S MIND IS
A TRAP CARD THAT SWITCHES

00:10:35.026 --> 00:10:37.395
ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD TO DEFENSE MODE

00:10:37.395 --> 00:10:40.265
AND THEN DOUBLES
THEIR DEFENSE POINTS.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.899
LET'S SEE YOUR
BIRD BRAIN BUFFOONS

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:43.601
GET PAST
THIS DEFENSE!

00:10:43.601 --> 00:10:45.470
BETTER LUCK
NEXT TIME, CROW.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.772
THEY'VE GOT
SOME STRONG
DEFENSE SET UP.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.507
AND THEY'RE DISHING
OUT DIRECT DAMAGE

00:10:49.507 --> 00:10:51.409
BY SUPPRESSING OUR
SPEED COUNTERS.

00:10:51.409 --> 00:10:52.944
ANY IDEAS?

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:54.879
ONLY ONE, BUT IF IT
DOESN'T WORK,

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:55.880
WE MAY NEED TO
BOOK A ROOM

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.715
AT THE FACILITY TONIGHT.

00:11:13.132 --> 00:11:14.466
THERE'S NO ESCAPING
SECTOR SECURITY,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.635
YOU SATELLITE
REJECTS.

00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:21.140
TIME TO START THROWING
THESE GUYS OFF OUR TAIL,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.208
AND I KNOW JUST
THE COMBO TO MAKE
THAT HAPPEN.

00:11:23.208 --> 00:11:25.611
I TUNE BLACKWING GALE
THE WHIRLWIND

00:11:25.611 --> 00:11:27.212
WITH BORA THE SPEAR!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.719
SAY HELLO TO...

00:11:33.719 --> 00:11:35.921
BLACKWING ARMOR MASTER!

00:11:37.956 --> 00:11:41.560
NOW ATTACK!
WITH BLACK HURRICANE!

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.961
Security A:
IS THIS SOME
KIND OF A JOKE?

00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:44.763
THAT FLYING OAF
DOESN'T HAVE

00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:46.065
ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS
TO BREAK

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:48.434
THROUGH GATE
BLOCKER 2'S DEFENSE.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.571
AND NOW YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO'S GONNA BE

00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:54.106
TAKING SOME DAMAGE.

00:11:54.106 --> 00:11:56.375
NOT WITH BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:59.945
ABOUT TO KICK IN,
OFFICER.

00:11:59.945 --> 00:12:03.716
BUT UNTIL THEN,
I PLACE TWO FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN!

00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:06.852
AND NOW YOUR WHIRLWIND'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:09.588
WEARS OFF, AND THE POWER
OF DEFENDER'S MIND KICKS IN!

00:12:11.824 --> 00:12:13.926
WITH 6000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:17.529
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY
TO TAKE A RUN AT GATE
BLOCKER 2 NOW, CROW!

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:18.964
IT'S MY TURN!

00:12:18.964 --> 00:12:21.100
BECAUSE OF FULL THROTTLE
AND GATE BLOCKER 2,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.368
THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR
SPEED COUNTERS IS FOUR!

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:26.472
NOW MY SPEED EDGE
IS GONNA STOP YOU
IN YOUR TRACKS!

00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:28.440
AAH!

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.642
I SUMMON GATE DEFENDER
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:12:30.642 --> 00:12:33.579
AND END MY TURN!

00:12:33.579 --> 00:12:35.848
Yusei: DID YOU EVER RUN
INTO OFFICER TRUDGE?

00:12:35.848 --> 00:12:37.416
I DEALT WITH THIS
GATE DEFENDER THING

00:12:37.416 --> 00:12:39.151
WHEN I DUELED HIM,
IT CAN NEGATE ONE

00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:41.120
MONSTER'S ATTACK
ONCE A TURN.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.689
DON'T WORRY... I'VE SET
THIS THING UP FOR US.

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:44.857
YOU JUST GOTTA
KNOCK IT DOWN.

00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.794
[CARLY SCREAMING]

00:12:52.698 --> 00:12:54.566
[SCREAMING]

00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:58.670
[SCREAMING]

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.672

00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:02.541
[SCREAMING]

00:13:08.814 --> 00:13:10.115
IT'S OKAY, SIR.

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.151
STOP CRYING, SIR,
WE'VE GOT YOU.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:14.052
THAT WAS GREAT!

00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:16.555
WE REALLY BONDED
JUST NOW!

00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:20.259
I'VE HAD A BETTER TIME
SITTING AND WATCHING
PAINT DRY.

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:21.693
[THINKING]
THIS ISN'T
GOING WELL.

00:13:21.693 --> 00:13:23.228
HOW CAN I GET HIM
TO OPEN UP TO ME

00:13:23.228 --> 00:13:26.098
ABOUT HIS LOSS
OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP?

00:13:26.098 --> 00:13:27.466
I'M OUTTA HERE.

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:30.869
CONSIDER YOUR SO-CALLED
"KINDNESS" REPAID.

00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:32.337
HEY, HANG ON.

00:13:32.337 --> 00:13:33.605
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?!

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:37.176
Boy: HEY, JACK!
JACK ATLAS!

00:13:37.176 --> 00:13:38.944
NO. THIS ISN'T
JACK ATLAS,

00:13:38.944 --> 00:13:40.612
HE JUST LOOKS
LIKE JACK.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:43.081
I KNOW IT'S HIM,
I'M HIS BIGGEST FAN!

00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:44.983
MY FRIENDS ALL SAY HE'S
A LOSER CAUSE HE LOST TO

00:13:44.983 --> 00:13:47.085
SOME GUY
FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:49.021
BUT I KNOW YOU CAN WIN
BACK THE CHAMPIONSHIP!

00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:50.122
RIGHT JACK?!

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:51.290
YOU'RE GONNA
SHOW 'EM ALL!

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.761
THAT'S NICE,
BUT I'M NOT JACK ATLAS.

00:13:55.761 --> 00:13:57.529
SEE YA LATER, JACK!

00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:00.098
YOU'RE STILL THE BEST
TURBO DUELIST EVER!

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:03.702
[THINKING]
THAT LITTLE BOY'S FRIENDS

00:14:03.702 --> 00:14:04.770
HAD IT ALL RIGHT.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.138
I AM A LOSER.

00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:08.340
HOW COULD I LOSE
THAT TOURNAMENT!

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.008
I HAVE TO MAKE
THIS RIGHT.

00:14:10.008 --> 00:14:12.411
I HAVE TO FIND YUSEI.

00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:13.679
HE'S SAD.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:18.250
[THINKING]
WHAT COULD I DO
TO CHEER HIM UP?

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.452
I REMEMBER THE ROAR
OF THE CROWD.

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:23.856
IT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS,
THAT'S ALL BEEN WASHED AWAY.

00:14:23.856 --> 00:14:25.724
NOBODY CHEERS
FOR A HAS BEEN.

00:14:25.724 --> 00:14:27.893
[CROWD CHANTING, "JACK!"]

00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:29.194
Yusei: YOU'RE WRONG,
OLD FRIEND.

00:14:29.194 --> 00:14:31.964
HUH?

00:14:31.964 --> 00:14:33.665
YUSEI?!

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:37.135
I HAVE TO FIND YOU.

00:14:37.135 --> 00:14:39.371
[THINKING]
HE'S REALLY UPSET
ABOUT LOSING TO YUSEI,

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:41.073
AND HERE I AM TRYING TO
GET HIM TO TALK ABOUT IT

00:14:41.073 --> 00:14:42.875
SO I CAN SCORE
AN ARTICLE AND KICKSTART

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:44.376
MY JOURNALISM CAREER.

00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:45.978
AM I A HORRIBLE PERSON?

00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:48.647
CARLY!
AAH! HEY, ANGELA.

00:14:48.647 --> 00:14:51.116
I ASSUME YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR ATLAS, TOO?

00:14:51.116 --> 00:14:52.985
HE WAS JUST SPOTTED
IN THE AREA, YA KNOW.

00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:55.153
JACK?! HE WAS?!

00:14:55.153 --> 00:14:57.122
I'M GONNA FIND HIM
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE,

00:14:57.122 --> 00:14:59.024
AND I'M GONNA GET HIM
TO ADMIT THAT THE RUMORS

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.827
ABOUT HIM BEING
FROM THE SATELLITE
SECTOR ARE TRUE.

00:15:01.827 --> 00:15:03.395
I MEAN, THEY
OBVIOUSLY ARE.

00:15:03.395 --> 00:15:04.897
WHY ELSE WOULD HE
HAVE SNUCK OUT

00:15:04.897 --> 00:15:07.032
OF THE HOSPITAL WHEN I
FIRST BROKE THE STORY?

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:09.968
MAYBE HE'S JUST
UPSET BECAUSE HE LOST
THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:15:09.968 --> 00:15:11.336
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LEAVE HIM ALONE

00:15:11.336 --> 00:15:13.138
AND LET HIM DEAL
WITH THINGS.

00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:14.473
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:15:14.473 --> 00:15:17.242
YOU DO WANNA BE
A REAL REPORTER,
DON'T YOU?

00:15:17.242 --> 00:15:19.011
REPORTERS DON'T
LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE.

00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:21.313
REPORTERS FOLLOW THEIR
LEADS AND EXPOSE PEOPLE

00:15:21.313 --> 00:15:23.081
FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

00:15:23.081 --> 00:15:25.550
REPORTERS DON'T
CARE ABOUT HOW
SOMEONE'S "FEELING."

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.519
THAT'S NOT
THE WAY IT WORKS.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.354
CARLY? DID YOU SEE SOME...

00:15:29.354 --> 00:15:30.689

I CAN'T LET THOSE

00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:41.366
I HAVE TO HELP HIM
GET THROUGH THIS.

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:44.236
WHERE COULD HE'VE GONE?

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.375
THAT TOWER.

00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:52.010
WE COULD SEE IT
FROM THE HOTEL,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.845
AND THE METRORAIL JACK
WAS TRYING TO GET ON

00:15:53.845 --> 00:15:55.480
WAS GOING THERE.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.649
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

00:15:57.649 --> 00:15:58.951

TO GIVE BLACKWING ARMOR

OUR GATE DEFENDER.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.043
AND ONCE WE WIN,
YOU TWO ARE GOING

00:17:07.043 --> 00:17:08.744
STRAIGHT
TO THE FACILITY!

00:17:08.744 --> 00:17:10.847
ACTUALLY, WITH TURBO
WARRIOR IN PLAY

00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:13.716
YOUR GATE DEFENDER WON'T
BE DEFENDING ANYTHING.

00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:16.853
AND BECAUSE YOUR
DEFENDER IS ONLY
A LEVEL FOUR MONSTER...

00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:19.822
I'M ACTIVATING THE EBON
ARROW TRAP CARD WHICH

00:17:19.822 --> 00:17:23.326
LOWERS THE ATTACK POINTS
OF TURBO WARRIOR
BY 500 POINTS!

00:17:23.326 --> 00:17:25.528
AND AS LONG AS
IT'S STRONGER THAN
YOUR DEFENDER,

00:17:25.528 --> 00:17:26.762
THE DIFFERENCE
IN THEIR POWER IS DEALT

00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:29.165
TO YOU AS DAMAGE,
AND AS A BONUS,

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:33.669
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THE DESTROYED MONSTER'S
ORIGINAL DEFENSE POINTS.

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:36.806
NOW TURBO WARRIOR!
ATTACK!

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:38.841
TRY ALL YOU WANT, YUSEI,
BUT YOU'RE ATTACKING

00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:41.410
A MONSTER WITH 6000
DEFENSE POINTS.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.413
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DOUBLE CHECK
YOUR MATH, OFFICER.

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:46.849
HUH? WHY'D
IT DROP TO ZERO?

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:48.684
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:50.319
Crow: WHEN BLACKWING ARMOR
MASTER ATTACKED

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:53.022
YOUR GATE DEFENDER, IT LEFT
A WEDGE COUNTER BEHIND,

00:17:53.022 --> 00:17:54.924
AND THAT WEDGE NOW WIPES
OUT ALL OF YOUR PRECIOUS

00:17:54.924 --> 00:17:56.792
DEFENDER'S ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS.

00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:58.227
ALL OF EM!?
ALL OF EM!?

00:17:58.227 --> 00:17:59.262
Yusei: ALL OF THEM!

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:06.536
OHH!
OHH!

00:18:06.536 --> 00:18:09.839
AND NOW YOU TAKE
THE DAMAGE FROM
EBON ARROW'S EFFECT!

00:18:14.143 --> 00:18:16.479
AAH!
AAH!

00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:18.047
HE GOT AWAY AGAIN!

00:18:21.217 --> 00:18:22.919
WE DID IT, CROW!

00:18:22.952 --> 00:18:25.288
YOU'VE GOTTEN
A LOT BETTER SINCE
THE OLD DAYS.

00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:26.689
YOU THINK SO?

00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:28.891
BY THE WAY, DID
YOU HEAR ABOUT JACK?

00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:30.660
SOME REPORTER FOUND OUT
HE'S REALLY

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.596
FROM THE SATELLITE
AND NOW HE'S GONE
OFF THE GRID.

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.164
HE DISAPPEARED?!

00:18:35.164 --> 00:18:36.599
SO ARE YOU STILL
TICKED OFF AT HIM

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.134
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOU?

00:18:38.134 --> 00:18:41.537
NOT ANYMORE, NO.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.140
JACK DID WHAT HE
THOUGHT HE HAD TO DO
AT THE TIME.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.841
HE THOUGHT IF HE DIDN'T
GRAB THAT OPPORTUNITY,

00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:47.410
HE'D BE STUCK
IN THE SATELLITE

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.644
FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE.

00:18:48.644 --> 00:18:50.513
I CAN'T BLAME HIM
FOR MAKING A CHOICE

00:18:50.513 --> 00:18:52.148
WHEN HE DIDN'T THINK
HE HAD ONE.

00:18:52.148 --> 00:18:56.018
WOW, MAN. YOU'RE
A BIGGER PERSON THAN I AM.

00:18:56.018 --> 00:18:57.286
I GUESS.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.636
HE'S BEEN STARING
AT THE WATER FOR HOURS.

00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:17.340
MAYBE NOW'S A GOOD
TIME TO TALK TO HIM.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.908
Carly: JACK.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.610
IF THIS WAS WHERE
YOU WANTED TO GO,

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.244
YOU COULDA JUST SAID SO.

00:19:24.614 --> 00:19:27.383
[THINKING]
WOW, HE SEEMS
WORSE THAN BEFORE.

00:19:27.383 --> 00:19:30.386
I WONDER WHAT
HE'S LOOKING AT?

00:19:30.386 --> 00:19:34.023
CAN YOU SEE
THE SATELLITE SECTOR
FROM HERE?

00:19:34.023 --> 00:19:35.891
DO YOU MISS IT, JACK?

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.494
DO YOU WANT TO GO
BACK THERE OR SOMETHING?

00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:41.130
ITS ALRIGHT YOU
CAN TELL ME.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.000
TWO YEARS AGO, I GAVE
UP EVERYTHING I KNEW

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.235
TO COME TO THIS CITY
FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:49.305
I BETRAYED MY FRIEND,
THE PEOPLE I
GREW UP WITH,

00:19:49.305 --> 00:19:52.108
I TURNED MY BACK
ON EVERYTHING I WAS.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:53.743
AND WHAT DID I GAIN?

00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:57.079
TEMPORARY GREATNESS,
THE ADMIRATION

00:19:57.079 --> 00:19:58.481
OF FICKLE FANS
WHO LOVE YOU

00:19:58.481 --> 00:19:59.715
WHEN YOU'RE ON TOP

00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:01.851
AND HATE YOU WHEN
YOU'RE NOT.

00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:04.587
IN ORDER TO BE
THE DUELIST
I WANTED TO BE,

00:20:04.587 --> 00:20:07.323
I LOST SIGHT
OF THE DUELIST
THAT I REALLY AM.

00:20:07.323 --> 00:20:11.027
I WANTED TO BE
THE GREATEST.

00:20:11.027 --> 00:20:14.563
BUT I SEE NOW THAT I
TOOK THE EASY PATH.

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:16.265
NOW THAT IT'S TOO LATE,

00:20:16.265 --> 00:20:18.167
I KNOW WHAT I REALLY
STAND FOR.

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.269
IT'S NOT TOO LATE, JACK,

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:22.938
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
A DO-OVER.

00:20:22.938 --> 00:20:26.609
YOU CAN USE WHAT YOU'VE
LEARNED AND GO FORWARD.

00:20:26.609 --> 00:20:29.045
THINK OF IT THIS
WAY... OLD JACK LOST

00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:30.946
IN THE BATTLE
AGAINST YUSEI.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.282
AND NEW JACK
WAS REBORN.

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:35.451
YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN.
YOU CAN GO BACK

00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:37.386
TO THE SATELLITE
AND RIGHT YOUR WRONGS.

00:20:37.386 --> 00:20:39.388
YOU CAN SAY SORRY
TO YOUR FRIENDS,

00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:42.124
AND THINGS CAN BE
LIKE THEY WERE BEFORE.

00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:44.927
HUH? AHH! JACK!

00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:46.128
HEY, THERE, JACK!

00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:47.229
BUD-DY!

00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:48.464
HEY, PAL.

00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:49.465
WHAT'S UP!

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:59.809
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:02.378
I CAN STILL DO THIS.

00:21:02.378 --> 00:21:04.647
THAT'S IT.
NO MORE HIDING.

00:21:04.647 --> 00:21:07.083
NO MORE FEELING
SORRY FOR MYSELF.

00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:08.551
IT'S TIME
TO MOVE ON.

00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:13.122
OHH! UH, JACK,
THAT WAS MY HAT.

00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:14.924
SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

00:21:14.957 --> 00:21:18.027
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO SHOW THE WORLD
WHO I REALLY AM.

00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.829
THEN YOU'LL NEED THIS!

00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:25.601
WRITE WHATEVER
YOU WANT ABOUT ME.

00:21:25.601 --> 00:21:29.171
ACTUALLY, I DECIDED.
I'M NOT GONNA
WRITE THE ARTICLE.

00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:31.440
NEW DOMINO CITY'LL JUST
USE IT AS AN EXCUSE

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.476
TO POINT THEIR
FINGERS AT YOU.

00:21:33.476 --> 00:21:36.645
AND I DON'T WANNA BE
A PART OF THAT.

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:37.913
[THINKING]
MAYBE WE'VE BOTH
LEARNED A LITTLE MORE

00:21:37.913 --> 00:21:39.949
ABOUT WHO WE REALLY ARE.

00:21:42.518 --> 00:21:43.786
THANK YOU, CARLY.

00:21:45.354 --> 00:21:46.822
HEY! WAIT UP!

00:21:46.822 --> 00:21:48.824
I'M COMING WITH YOU!
