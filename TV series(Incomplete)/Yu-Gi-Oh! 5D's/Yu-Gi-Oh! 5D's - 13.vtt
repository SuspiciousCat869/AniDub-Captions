00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.598
Leo: SHOULD WE
WAKE HIM UP?

00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:04.566
Luna: I DUNNO... LOOK AT
THAT MARKER ON HIS CHEEK.

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.901
WHAT ABOUT IT?

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.270
REMEMBER THAT WEIRDO
WHO USED TO CLEAN
THE POOL?

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.871
WHEN DAD CAME HOME
AND SAW THAT GUY

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.507
HAD A MARK ON HIS CHEEK,
HE FIRED HIM.

00:00:12.507 --> 00:00:15.010
DAD SAID THAT MARK MEANT
HE WAS IN THE FACILITY.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.747
SO YOU THINK THIS GUY
WAS IN THE FACILITY
TOO?...COO-OOL!

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.749
THAT'S NOT COOL,
YOU DORK!

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.318
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN
TO THE FACILITY ARE BAD.

00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:25.554
WELL... TALK TO
HIS CARD SPIRITS.

00:00:25.554 --> 00:00:27.556
SEE WHAT THEY HAVE
TO SAY ABOUT HIM.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:28.657
WELL?

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:31.727
THEY SAY THAT HE'S
A VERY GOOD PERSON.

00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:34.196
THEY ALSO SAY
HE'S VERY SAD.

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:35.931
I WONDER WHAT
HE'S SAD ABOUT.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.899
MAYBE HE LOST HIS DOG
OR HIS HAMSTER...

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.234
SHHH!...HE'S WAKING UP.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.404
Yusei: WHO ARE YOU?!

00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:44.139
Luna: WE FOUND YOU
IN THE ALLEY DOWNSTAIRS.

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:45.140
Leo: YOU WRECKED

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:24.706
Luna: LEO!

00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:26.174
HOW DID I END UP
IN THAT ALLEYWAY?

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:31.046
Trudge: DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID!?

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:32.848
THERE MAY BE
A FUGITIVE IN THERE!

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.483
Security guard:

SO, HOW DID IT GO?

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:58.306
JEEVES OVER THERE

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.746
IN ORDER TO GET IN THERE

00:03:04.746 --> 00:03:07.182
THESE TOPS SECURITY
SNOBS ACTUALLY

00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:09.484
JUST 'CAUSE THEY GUARD
THE RICH CATS.

00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:11.186

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.054
WHAT DO YA' WANNA DO

00:03:13.054 --> 00:03:15.390
HE'S DEFINITELY

00:03:20.595 --> 00:03:21.696
UH.

NOW THAT YOU GOT
YOUR JACKET ON,

00:03:23.532 --> 00:03:26.101
TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND SAY
"MY NAME IS"...

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:27.669
AND THEN...
SAY YOUR NAME!

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.271
HE'S TRIED THAT
10 TIMES.

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:31.473
IT'S OBVIOUSLY
NOT WORKING, LEO.

00:03:31.473 --> 00:03:33.441
WELL, IT WORKED ON TV!

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:35.644
I SAW THIS GUY
ON A SHOW ONE TIME?

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:37.712
HE WAS HELPING PEOPLE
REMEMBER THINGS
THEY FORGOT,

00:03:37.712 --> 00:03:39.714
LIKE WHERE THEY LEFT
THEIR KEYS AND STUFF...

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:41.383
HEY. WHATCHA LOOKIN AT?

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:43.251
Yusei: THOSE.

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:45.754
HUH? OH!
THAT'S MY SHRINE!

00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:48.190
JACK ATLAS IS LIKE
MY ALL-TIME HERO.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.793
HE'S THE GREATEST,
NO ONE CAN BEAT HIM
IN A TURBO DUEL!

00:03:51.793 --> 00:03:54.529
N'ONE DAY, I'M
GONNA BE THE CHAMP,
JUST LIKE JACK.

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.199
YOU CAN'T EVEN
RIDE A NORMAL BIKE.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.835
I STAYED UP
FOR 12 SECONDS
LAST TIME I TRIED!

00:03:59.835 --> 00:04:02.704
SO DOES JACK ATLAS
MEAN ANYTHING
TO YOU?

00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:04.940
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
KNOW WHY.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.808
MAYBE YOU'RE A FAN
OF HIS, TOO.

00:04:06.808 --> 00:04:08.410
OR MAYBE YOU WERE
HOPING TO DUEL HIM,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.679
I MEAN, YOU ARE
A TURBO DUELIST.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:11.980

HUH?

00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:18.954
AM I RIGHT ABOUT YOU?

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:21.857
ARE YOU
A BIG TIME DUELIST
IN TOWN TO DUEL JACK?

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.758
I DON'T THINK I'M
A BIG TIME ANYTHING.

00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:28.463
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
HYPNOTIZING HIM, LEO.

00:04:28.463 --> 00:04:32.133
I KNOW! AH!

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:34.002
MISTER!... MAYBE YOU HAVE
ONE OF THESE.

00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:35.070
I'LL TAKE IT OUT,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.705
YOU TELL ME
IF IT LOOKS FAMILIAR.

00:04:36.705 --> 00:04:38.139
OK...

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.207
WELL!?

00:04:39.207 --> 00:04:41.576
DOES THIS
RING ANY BELLS?

00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:43.578
THE FORTUNE CUP?

00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:45.513

BIG TOURNAMENT

00:04:45.513 --> 00:04:47.849

I'M GONNA BE IN IT!

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:54.256
ACTUALLY,
THEY SELECTED ME.

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:55.724
TECHNICALLY,
THEY SELECTED LUNA,

00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:57.225
BUT SHE'S TOO SCARED
TO ENTER,

00:04:57.225 --> 00:04:59.060
SO I'M GONNA PRETEND
TO BE HER AND ENTER

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.462
AND THEN WIN THAT THING!

00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:02.697
NO ONE'S GONNA BELIEVE
YOU'RE ME, LEO.

00:05:02.697 --> 00:05:03.965
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
BELIEVE IT?

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:06.034
WE'RE TWINS,
WE LOOK JUST ALIKE.

00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:07.802
I'M A GIRL.
I'M PRETTY.

00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:09.104

YOU'RE JEALOUS.

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:17.178
WHY ARE WE EVEN
ARGUING ABOUT THIS?

00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:19.614
WE STILL HAVE
A BAD GUY IN OUR HOUSE.

00:05:19.614 --> 00:05:22.017
YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
THAT HE'S A BAD GUY, LUNA.

00:05:22.017 --> 00:05:24.185
MAYBE HE WAS FRAMED FOR
A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT,

00:05:24.185 --> 00:05:26.821
THAT HAPPENS, YOU KNOW,
I SAW IT ON TV ONCE.

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:28.690
UM... HE'S STILL
IN THE ROOM.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.792
HUH? UHH...

THANKS FOR TRYING TO HELP ME
AND EVERYTHING, BUT...

00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.064
THIS FORTUNE CUP THING
ISN'T RINGING ANY BELLS.

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:40.502
I SHOULD GET OUTTA HERE.

00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:42.137

00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:04.526
THIS COULD HELP HIM!

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:06.194
I SAW IT ON TV
THIS ONE TIME,

00:06:06.194 --> 00:06:08.363
JACK ATLAS WAS GIVING
AN INTERVIEW, AND...!

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:09.998
JACK SAID THAT THE WAY
A DUELIST DUELS

00:06:09.998 --> 00:06:11.533
REVEALS WHO HE REALLY IS,

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:14.002
SO IF YOU DUEL,
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER YOU ARE!

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:18.740

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.101
IS THAT
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.003
THAT NOT HAVING OUR PARENTS
AROUND ALL THE TIME

00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:31.104
IS THE COOLEST.

00:07:31.104 --> 00:07:32.906
I SEE.

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:34.908
WELL... HOW'S THAT?

00:07:34.908 --> 00:07:37.477
UH... IT'S PERFECT!

00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:38.812
THANKS, MISTER
AMNESIA MAN.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.115
WHADDYA SAY,
YOU READY TO DUEL?

00:07:42.115 --> 00:07:43.984
YOU CAN HAVE
THE FIRST TURN LEO.

00:07:43.984 --> 00:07:44.985
YEAH!!!

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.659
I SHOULD WARN YOU,
MY DECK RULES!

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.461
I'M SURE IT DOES.

00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:55.595
HERE WE GO...!

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.732
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:07:58.732 --> 00:08:01.668
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE DUEL IS ON!

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:04.171
THE AMAZING LEO DRAWS!

00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:05.972
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:08.275
I'M CALLING OUT
MORPHTRONIC CELFON.

00:08:22.322 --> 00:08:24.858
YEAH!! THIS GUY'S SWEET!

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:27.227
NOW MY MORPHTRONIC'S
SPECIAL ABILITIES CHANGE

00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:29.629
DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY'RE
IN ATTACK OR DEFENSE MODE.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:32.065
N 'SINCE MORPHTRONIC CELFON'S
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:35.135
IT DIALS AND RANDOMLY STOPS
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 1 AND 6.

00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:36.803
THEN... I TAKE THAT NUMBER
AND FLIP OVER

00:08:36.803 --> 00:08:38.138
THE SAME NUMBER OF CARDS.

00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:39.873
IF ANY OF THOSE
IS A LEVEL 4-OR-BELOW

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:41.374
MORPHTRONIC MONSTER...

00:08:41.374 --> 00:08:43.210
THEN I CAN SUMMON IT!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.845
HERE WE GO!

00:08:44.845 --> 00:08:46.079
[SIGH]

00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:47.480
YOU OK?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.017
IT APPEARS THAT
LEO'S DUEL DISK
IS A LITTLE HEAVY.

00:08:51.017 --> 00:08:53.286
YOU SHOULD KNOW...
HE NARRATES HIS DUELS.

00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:55.422
WE NEED SILENCE
IN THE ARENA, PEOPLE!

00:08:55.422 --> 00:08:57.057
THIS IS A CRITICAL MOMENT!

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:59.626
THE CELFON IS
DIALI-I-ING... NOW!

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:04.464
N' IT STOPPED ON 3!

00:09:04.497 --> 00:09:05.765
THE CROWD IS TENSE.

00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:09.536
LOOK AT THIS!

00:09:09.536 --> 00:09:11.605
ONE OF THE CARDS
THE AMAZING LEO HAS FLIPPED

00:09:11.605 --> 00:09:13.840
IS A LEVEL 3,
MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN!

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.008
THAT MEANS
HE CAN SUMMON IT.

00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.679
THE CROWD GOES WILD!

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:23.283
[FAKE CHEERING]
AWESOME!

00:09:23.283 --> 00:09:25.285
NICE ONE!
YEAH! WOOHOO!

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.291
Duel runner computer:
WHEN THE MONSTER CARD
MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN

00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.592
IS IN DEFENSE MODE

00:09:32.592 --> 00:09:35.128
YOUR OPPONENT CANNOT
ATTACK ANY OTHER MONSTER

00:09:35.128 --> 00:09:36.997
EXCEPT THIS ONE.

00:09:36.997 --> 00:09:38.865
NEXT I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.367
AND END MY TURN!

00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.402
AND NOW...
WILL MR. AMNESIA MAN

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:43.870
RISE TO THE CHALLENGE?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.474
SOMETIMES I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M RELATED TO HIM.

00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:49.809
I HOPE THIS JOGS
MY MEMORY.

00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:52.345
I SUMMON SPEED WARRIOR.

00:09:54.547 --> 00:09:55.649
AND DURING
THE WHOLE TURN

00:09:55.649 --> 00:09:57.951
THAT SPEED WARRIOR IS
SUMMONED TO THE FIELD...

00:09:57.951 --> 00:09:59.653
ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE DOUBLED!

00:09:59.653 --> 00:10:00.654
THEY'RE DOUBLED!?

00:10:00.654 --> 00:10:02.322
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:10:02.322 --> 00:10:03.823
CELFON IS DOOMED!!

00:10:03.823 --> 00:10:05.926
BUT, WAIT, WHAT'S THIS,
LADIES AND GENTS?!

00:10:05.926 --> 00:10:07.961
THE AMAZING LEO
ACTIVATES A TRAP CARD!

00:10:09.629 --> 00:10:11.197
BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH?!

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:17.971
AMAZING!... LEO USED
HIS MORPHTRANSITION TRAP

00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.173
TO PUT HIS MORPHTRONIC
MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:22.075
SO HE COULD
BLOCK THE ATTACK!

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:23.977
I THINK MY MEMORY'S
COMING BACK.

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:26.713
LOOKS LIKE LEO'S
ALREADY ON THE PATH
TO VICTORY, PEOPLE,

00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:28.481
THERE'S NO
DEFEATING HIM!

00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:30.917
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
TO GET COCKY.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:32.485
JUST YOU WAIT!

00:10:32.485 --> 00:10:34.788
YOU'RE GONNA END
YOUR TURN NOW, RIGHT?

00:10:34.788 --> 00:10:36.156
I AM.

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:38.091
WELL IN THAT CASE...
I'M UP!

00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:40.627
I DRAW...!

00:10:40.627 --> 00:10:42.429
MAYBE YOU NEED
A SMALLER DUEL DISK.

00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.630
NO I DON'T!

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.200
FROM MY HAND... I SUMMON
ANOTHER MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.536
BUT THIS TIME,
IT'S IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:02.949
ADMIT IT,
THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME!

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:05.352
WHEN THERE'S ONE MAGNEN
ON THE FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:06.987
YOU CAN'T ATTACK
ANY OTHER MONSTER,

00:11:06.987 --> 00:11:08.888
BUT THIS IS AN EVEN BETTER
DEFENSE SYSTEM

00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:11.191
BECAUSE NOW ON THE FIELD
I'VE GOT 2 MAGNENS!

00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:13.493
WHICH MEANS... I'M INVISIBLE!

00:11:15.395 --> 00:11:19.065
I THINK YOU MEANT TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE INVINCIBLE.

00:11:19.065 --> 00:11:21.134
Policeman: THE STREETS
ARE BLOCKED.

00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:23.169
Second policeman:
GET INTO POSITION!

00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:24.704
PUT YOUR SQUAD
ON THE WEST GATE.

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:26.306
CHECK EVERYONE
LEAVING THE BUILDING.

00:11:26.306 --> 00:11:28.174
OLD LADIES, EVERYONE!

00:11:28.174 --> 00:11:30.477
Policeman: GOT IT!

00:11:30.477 --> 00:11:33.146
[THINKING] THOSE SECTOR
SECURITY GOONS HAVE GOT
THE BUILDING SURROUNDED.

00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:35.148
AND IF YOU DON'T FIGURE
A WAY OUT, YUSEI?

00:11:35.148 --> 00:11:36.950
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO
THE FACILITY FOR GOOD.

00:11:52.368 --> 00:11:55.304
Leo: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!

00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:56.605
IF MR. AMNESIA MAN

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:58.774
TRIES TO ATTACK
THE FIRST MAGNEN...

00:11:58.774 --> 00:12:01.010
THE SECOND MAGNEN
WILL ABSORB THE ATTACK!

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.379
IF HE TRIES TO ATTACK
THE SECOND MAGNEN...

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:05.514
THE FIRST MAGNEN WILL
ABSORB THE ATTACK!

00:12:05.514 --> 00:12:07.616
IT'S MAGNELOCK!

00:12:07.616 --> 00:12:10.152
MR. AMNESIA MAN
HAS NO HOPE WHATSOEVER

00:12:10.152 --> 00:12:12.221
OF BREAKING THROUGH
LEO'S DEFENSE!

00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:16.092
THE UNSTOPPABLE LEO
IS DRIVING THE CROWD
TOTALLY CRAZY!

00:12:16.092 --> 00:12:17.960
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.930
NOW I'M GOING TO
USE CELFON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY AGAIN!

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.965
CELFON IS DIALING, NOW!

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:25.267
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
WHERE'S IT GONNA STOP?

00:12:28.537 --> 00:12:29.739
AND IT'S A 2!

00:12:29.739 --> 00:12:32.274
WHICH MEANS LEO
CAN DRAW 2 CARDS.

00:12:32.274 --> 00:12:33.676
AND AGAIN, HE'S GOT
A MORPHTRONIC

00:12:33.676 --> 00:12:34.677
THAT QUALIFIES!

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:37.880
HE SUMMONS
DIRECTLY TO THE FIELD...

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.149
MORPHTRONIC DATATRON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:46.889 --> 00:12:49.625
THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING
OF THE AWESOMENESS!

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:52.862
FROM MY HAND, I ACTIVATE
THE GADGET BOX SPELL CARD!

00:12:52.862 --> 00:12:55.097
N'THANKS TO THIS
BADBOY OF A CARD,

00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:57.166
I'M NOW ABLE TO SUMMON OUT
ONE GADGET TOKEN

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:58.834
ONCE EVERY TURN!

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:00.069
SO HERE COMES THE FIRST!

00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:04.940
HOW DOES HE THINK
A MONSTER

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.942
WITH NO ATTACK POINTS
AND NO DEFENSE POINTS

00:13:06.942 --> 00:13:08.010
IS GONNA HELP?

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.678
I'VE GATHERED
ALL THE PARTS!

00:13:09.678 --> 00:13:12.515
NOW FOR DATATRON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:14.750
BY RELEASING ONE MONSTER
FROM THE FIELD,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.455
I CAN HAVE DATATRON DISH OUT
600 POINTS OF DIRECT DAMAGE.

00:13:19.455 --> 00:13:21.457
SO BY REMOVING
MY GADGET TOKEN...

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:25.828
I CAN NOW ATTACK YOU!

00:13:25.828 --> 00:13:27.663
GO DATATRON
CORRUPTOR CANNON!

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.769
HE USES WEAKER MONSTERS
IN WAYS YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT.

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:35.604
THAT REMINDS ME OF...

00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:37.940
I SUMMON SONIC CHICK
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:40.943 --> 00:13:45.014
I SUMMON OUT
SPEED WARRIOR.

00:13:45.014 --> 00:13:47.683
I SUMMON QUILL BOLT HEDGEHOG
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:52.154
I DID IT I DID IT
I DID IT!

00:13:52.188 --> 00:13:54.256
I TOLD YOU THAT COMBO
COULD WORK, LUNA,

00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:55.925
BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK
I COULD PULL IT OFF,

00:13:55.925 --> 00:13:57.026
BUT I DID IT!

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:58.761
THE CROWD'S GOING CRAZY
FOR LEO'S

00:13:58.761 --> 00:14:00.729
SPECTACULAR
MORPHTRONIC DECK!

00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:03.098
ISN'T IT THE END
OF YOUR TURN NOW?

00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:05.501
OH YEAH, UH...
GOT CARRIED AWAY.

00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:07.069
MAKE YOUR MOVE,
MR. AMNESIA MAN.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.509
WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON THE FORTUNE CUP?

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:15.978
THE INVITATIONS WERE
MAILED OUT AS REQUESTED.

00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:19.748
ONLY ONE REMAINS UNSENT.
[GIGGLES]

00:14:19.748 --> 00:14:21.684
I ASSUME THAT ONE
IS YUSEI'S.

00:14:21.684 --> 00:14:22.852
WHERE IS HE?

00:14:22.852 --> 00:14:24.520
HE RECOVERED HIS RUNNER.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.223
BUT WHEN HE DID, THAT
OFFICER TRUDGE WAS THERE

00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:29.225
AND HE CHASED YUSEI
TO THE TOPS.

00:14:29.225 --> 00:14:31.493
NOW TRUDGE HAS
THE PLACE SURROUNDED.

00:14:31.493 --> 00:14:33.429
WASN'T TRUDGE
TOLD TO BACK OFF?

00:14:33.429 --> 00:14:35.331
SOME PEOPLE
JUST DON'T LISTEN.

00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:37.032
PERHAPS I SHOULD
GO TO HIM IN PERSON

00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:38.601
AND REMIND HIM
WHO'S IN CHARGE

00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:41.337
BEFORE THIS... "SITUATION"
GETS OUT OF HAND.

00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:45.074
IT'S MY TURN.

00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:50.379
I SEND ONE CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:53.148
IN ORDER TO ACTIVATE
THE CARD ROTATOR
SPELL CARD.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.752
WHAT'S THAT DO?

00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:59.388
WELL CARD ROTATOR
CHANGES THE BATTLE MODE

00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:01.857
OF EVERY MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD.

00:15:01.857 --> 00:15:03.759
HUH?! AS IN
ALL OF 'EM?

00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:06.929
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:14.370
AAAH!
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.106
WE'RE SEEING
AN AWFUL TURNAROUND!
THE MAGNIFICENT LEO...

00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:19.608
[SIGH]
STOP NARRATING, LEO!

00:15:19.608 --> 00:15:21.377
JUST FOCUS ON
STAYING IN THE DUEL.

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:22.411
BUT I'M TOAST!

00:15:22.411 --> 00:15:24.346
Yusei: NOT YET.

00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:26.382
BUT AFTER I SUMMON
JUNK SYNCHRON,

00:15:26.382 --> 00:15:27.383
YOU MIGHT BE.

00:15:29.118 --> 00:15:30.786
I AM TOTALLY GONNA LOSE.

00:15:30.786 --> 00:15:32.788
WELL WITH JUNK SYNCHRON
IN PLAY...

00:15:32.788 --> 00:15:35.824
I CAN SUMMON A LEVEL
2-OR-BELOW MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:15:35.824 --> 00:15:37.126
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:37.126 --> 00:15:40.062
SO I SUMMON
TO THE FIELD...
NITRO SYNCHRON.

00:15:41.597 --> 00:15:43.165
THIS MEANS HE CAN
SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:45.067
A LEVEL 7 MONSTER NOW.

00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:46.135
NUH-UH.

00:15:46.135 --> 00:15:47.169
YEAH HUH.

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:49.038
HE'S GOT A LEVEL 3...
A LEVEL 2...

00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:50.806
AND ANOTHER LEVEL 2!

00:15:50.806 --> 00:15:52.341
IF YOU ADD THEM UP
YOU GET 7

00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:54.910
WHICH BRINGS OUT A LEVEL 7
SYNCRO MONSTER!

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.112
TRUE, EXCEPT THAT IN ORDER
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:15:57.112 --> 00:15:59.481
I CAN ONLY USE ONE TUNER.
HUH?

00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.117
JUNK SYNCHRON
AND NITRO SYNCHRON
ARE TUNER MONSTERS,

00:16:02.117 --> 00:16:04.520

SEE WHEN IT DESTROYS
A MONSTER IN BATTLE...

00:17:33.027 --> 00:17:35.229

BUT BY SENDING ALL
YOUR TIME AND ENERGY

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:29.817
GETTING YOUR MONSTERS
WHERE YOU WANTED
THEM TO BE...

00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.319
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE
ROOM TO ANTICIPATE

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.087
ANY COUNTER-ATTACKS.

00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:35.723
YOUR MORPHTRONIC
MONSTERS CAN ADAPT.

00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:38.292
NOW YOU JUST NEED
TO LEARN HOW TO DO
THE SAME.

00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:39.794

00:18:42.263 --> 00:18:44.932

00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:46.601
SO UM...

00:18:46.601 --> 00:18:48.669
ARE YOU GONNA
TELL US WHO YOU ARE?

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.905

THE SAFER YOU'LL BE.

00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:01.916
OK, BUT... IF I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:03.584
THEN HOW CAN I BE
YOUR FRIEND?

00:19:03.584 --> 00:19:05.553
I THINK THAT'S
KINDA THE POINT, LEO,

00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:07.321
HE'S SAYING HE CAN'T
BE OUR FRIEND.

00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.689
