want to destroy
the Satellite Sector?

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.029
That's right, Nervin.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.198

If it's true,
what do we do?

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.338
I know, we go home, pack up,
and then use that pipeline

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:27.007
to get out of here.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:28.308
Sounds good to me.

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.910
If these Dark Signers
are here, we should

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.078
all go over there.

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.079
I'm good with a deck,

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.580
but once the
shuffling part's done,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.049
it's all downhill
after that.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.719
I know you're scared,
Nervin, and so am I.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.021
But this mark has made
me a part of this war,

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:42.823
and if I don't fight
the Dark Signers,

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.424
then there's no
hope for anyone.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.625
You know I'm with you,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.561
a Crow never backs
away from a fight.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.329
And I got my nest to protect.

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.699
But they hurt your bike,
just say the word, pal,

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.767

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.035

That's not true.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.371
You'll always protect us.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:04:00.407
Can you tell us a
good-night story, Crow?

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:01.908
How about a scary one?

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.976
But you're afraid
of the dark,

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.879
and you always run off
before he gets to finish it!

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.548
How about I tell the one
about the bridge to nowhere?

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:09.449
Tell it!

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.383

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:12.152
Well...okay.

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:14.821
A long time ago there
was a special place.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:16.690
An island in the
middle of the ocean.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.192
But the people were very
sad because they were poor

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.594
and had to work
all the time.

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.195
Next to them was
another island,

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.830
where the people
were rich and happy,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.031
and never had to work.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.233
Get to the part
with the bridge,

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.701
this bit is so boring!

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:30.070
Oh, and don't forget,
you gotta do it with voices!

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.838
Ugh, there are no voices!

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.508
Hey, I didn't ask for
the running commentary.

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:35.375
Be quiet!

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.010
I'll get to all
that soon enough.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.879

(grunting)

00:04:39.746 --> 00:04:43.517

without voices!

Okay, so there's the
Satellite and the City,

two isolated islands.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.157
But one day, a man
had a great idea.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:51.258
He wanted freedom.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:52.793
He wanted to connect
the two islands,

00:04:52.793 --> 00:04:54.828
so people could
choose where to live.

00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:57.497

the trouble began.

when a stranger arrived
in the Satellite.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.584
No one knew who he was
or where he was from.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.920
He never spoke, and spent
nearly all his time

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.621
staring across

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:23.824

Of what no one else dared,
making a difference.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:31.531
One day, with no
fanfare and no help,

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:33.233
he began to build a bridge.

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:34.868
He was determined
to join the Satellite

00:05:34.868 --> 00:05:36.369
and New Domino City.

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:39.172
He was determined
to give people hope.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:42.409
Hold on, one guy's gonna build
a whole bridge by himself?

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.011
It's impossible,
this story's for kids!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.214
And that's what
they all believed.

00:05:47.214 --> 00:05:49.649
They said what he was
doing was impossible.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.485
But, through it all,
he kept working.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.521
People came from all
over the Satellite

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.457
to look and to laugh, but
the stranger kept building.

00:05:57.457 --> 00:05:59.359
And then, a funny
thing happened.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.161
People started to believe.

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.496
Before they had no hope,
they had no life,

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.531
except their work.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.533
They thought even
if the bridge was

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.302
an impossible dream,
it was still a dream.

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.338
A handful of volunteers
became a dozen,

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.505
a dozen, a hundred.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:13.773
And soon, it looked
like the bridge

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:15.508
might actually be built.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.744
But not everyone was
happy with that idea.

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.946
The people of the City,
the people of power,

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.481
liked the way things were.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.616
They didn't want
to give the people

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:24.251
of the Satellite
their freedom.

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.586
They threatened to send
everyone to the Facility

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.188
if they were
found working on it.

00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:31.091
Many were arrested,
but most simply gave up,

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.159
their dreams fading
away like the hope

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.128
for a future with freedom.

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:35.929
That's not right!

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:36.930

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.164

I'm just sayin'!

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.902
It's not fair they did that!

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:42.969
Well, yeah.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.038
But whoever said
that life was fair?

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.439

Oh, right.

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.877
So, security had other
plans for the stranger.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.846
He tried to outrun them
as long as he could,

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.615
but he knew in the end that
they'd finally catch him.

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:56.583
He was surrounded.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.617
No way out.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.119
Escape was impossible!

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.888
He knew he'd spend the rest
of his life in the Facility,

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:04.024

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.650
where the ancient phenomenon
known as the Nazca Lines

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.254
are vanishing from Earth
with no known explanation.

"Whoa, cool spider dude!"

And then things
get all freaky-deeky!

laser light shows where

like, bow-weoh--
