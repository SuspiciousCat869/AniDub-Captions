THAT CONTINUES
TO PROTECT IT

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.862
BOTH REPRESENT
THE STRENGTH
MY FRIENDS GIVE ME.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.831
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.066
YOU'RE THE SELFISH JACK
I USED TO BE,

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:55.701
THE JACK THAT HAD NO USE
FOR FRIENDS,

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.704
AND THAT MAKES YOU
THE WEAKER ONE!

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.539
AH!

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.774
AH!
AH!
AH!

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:03.576
HUH?

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:04.710
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.045
THEY'RE GATHERING TOGETHER.

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.881
ALL RIGHT, CRIMSON DRAGON,
GET TO IT!

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.751
GIVE JACK THE POWER
THAT HE NEEDS!

00:19:17.023 --> 00:19:17.823
NOW, ALLOW ME
TO SHOW YOU

00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:19.959
WHAT A REAL DUELIST
IS CAPABLE OF.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.862
I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO
ACCEPT DEFEAT, BECAUSE...

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.798
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE!

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:30.536
I SUMMON TO THE FIELD
MAJESTIC DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:39.111
AND NOW MAJESTIC DRAGON
TUNES RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND

00:19:39.879 --> 00:19:42.114
AND DARK BUG!

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:56.462
THIS IS MY TRUE POWER!
I SYNCHRO SUMMON--

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.832
MAJESTIC RED DRAGON!

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:02.435
UNBELIEVABLE!

00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:04.270
BELIEVE IT,
YOU INADEQUATE PUNK!

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.440
AND MAJESTIC RED DRAGON
HAS A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.442
IT CAN ABSORB
ALL OF THE ATTACK POINTS

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.744
FROM ONE OF THE MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD!

00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:15.014
GO POWER GAIN!

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:24.023
7,000 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.592
IT'S BEEN SO NICE AND
ALL HAVING YOU AROUND!

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.162
BUT IT'S TIME FOR
THE REAL JACK ATLAS
TO STAND UP!

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.699
GO ULTIMATE POWERFORCE!

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.245
THAT THING'S A ROBOT?

00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:08.934
WELL, I GUESS THAT
WAS IMPRESSIVE.

00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:12.638
AND I WENT THROUGH
ALL THAT TROUBLE
TO COPY THOSE CARDS.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.407
WHAT A WASTE!

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:22.615
THE CIRCUIT'S
BEEN ACTIVATED!

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:24.250
EXCELLENT.

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:28.587
I TOLD YOU HE'D FIT INTO
THE GRAND DESIGN.

00:21:33.392 --> 00:21:34.393
JACK! YOU DID IT!

00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:36.529
AND I WITNESSED
THE WHOLE THING!

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.564
SO I CAN TESTIFY THAT
YOU WEREN'T THE ONE

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:39.799
COMMITTING THOSE CRIMES.

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:41.400
THANK YOU, KAZ.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.602
I KNEW JACK WAS INNOCENT.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:45.838
I JUST KNEW IT!

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:48.140
HOLD STILL!

00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:49.308
OKAY...

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:50.709
IT-- IT IS YOU!

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:52.478
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER
SEE YOU AGAIN!

00:21:53.245 --> 00:21:54.280
I THOUGHT A LOTTA
THINGS ABOUT YOU
THAT WEREN'T TRUE.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.182
I-- I SAID ALL SORTS
O' MEAN STUFF,

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:57.950
AND I CALLED YOU
NAMES LIKE...

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:01.120
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, CROW.
I WAS BEING STUBBORN.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:04.824
ALTHOUGH IF YOU WANNA KEEP
GROVELING AND APOLOGIZING,
I'LL TAKE IT.

00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:06.959
ALL RIGHT, DON'T
MILK IT, YOU JERK!

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.628
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.034
Crow: YOU'RE SURE THIS IS WHERE
YOU WERE BEING HELD?

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:18.270
Jack: YES, I'M SURE.
THERE WAS A CAVE, AND--

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:19.505
BUT IT'S GONE NOW.

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:22.474
EVEN MY DUEL RUNNER TRACKS
ARE GONE.

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:24.143
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.011
WHAT WAS THAT ROBOT?

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:28.681
WHY WAS IT RUNNING AROUND
AND ACTING LIKE ME?

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.050
AND HOW DID IT HAVE
MY CARDS?

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.619
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
THIS ROBOT HAS
ANYTHING TO DO

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:34.954
WITH THAT OTHER
DUEL BOT?

00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:37.990
IT'S DEFINITELY ALL CONNECTED,
I'M SURE OF IT.

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.559
THE DUEL BOTS, ILLIASTER,
THE GRAND PRIX--

00:22:41.327 --> 00:22:42.661
THE PIECES ARE THERE.

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:43.929
NOW IT'S UP TO US

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:47.833
TO FIGURE OUT
HOW THEY ALL FIT TOGETHER.
