WE LOVE YOU, JACK!

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:44.417
Jack: HOPE YOU'RE
READY, ANDRE,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.319
BECAUSE WHEN RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND ATTACKS

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.354
EVEN ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:51.558
THEN ALL OF THE MONSTERS
YOU HAVE IN DEFENSE
MODE ARE DESTROYED.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:53.593
NOW LET HIM HAVE IT,
ARCHFIEND.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.062
ATTACK WITH ABSOLUTE
POWERFORCE!

00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:58.331
YES. HE FELL FOR IT!

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:01.201
I PLAY UNI-HORNED
FAMILIAR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.570
YOU SEE, WHEN UNI-HORNED
FAMILIAR IS ATTACKED

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.971
WHILE IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.173
BY REMOVING A MONSTER
ON MY FIELD FROM PLAY,

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:10.210
I CAN ALSO REMOVE
UNI-HORNED FAMILIAR
FROM PLAY.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.311
WHAT?

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:13.713
NOW ANDRE'S FIELD DOESN'T
HAVE A THING ON IT.

00:10:13.713 --> 00:10:15.648
Jack, thinking:
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
LURING ME IN

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.484
SO THAT HE COULD USE
A TRAP ON ME.

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:20.120
Jack: IN THAT CASE,
NICE TRY, ANDRE,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.690
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M STOPPING ARCHFIEND'S
ATTACK HERE AND NOW.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.892
YOU'RE NOT STOPPING
ANYTHING, JACK.

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.627
MY UNI-HORNED
FAMILIAR'S ABILITY

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.929
FORCES YOU
TO SEE YOUR ATTACK
THROUGH TO THE END.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.164
WHAT?

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:33.600
COME TO ME,
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND...

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.137
COME AND BE SNARED

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.205
LIKE THE ANNOYING LITTLE
PEST THAT YOU ARE.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:40.640
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.476
DIFFERENT DIMENSION
BARRIER--LOST FORCE!

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.379
NOW THE DAMAGE
YOUR ARCHFIEND WAS
ABOUT TO INFLICT ON ME

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.414
IS DEFLECTED BACK TO YOU!

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.582
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:55.455
[DRAGON ROARS]

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.459
[GROANS]

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.461
OH!
HE'S BEEN HIT.

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.462
OH, DEAR!

00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:04.964
IS HE OK?
HANG ON!

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.499
HE'LL PAY FOR THAT!

00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.549
Announcer:
JACK ATLAS JUST TOOK
A CRUSHING COUNTER-HIT.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:24.184
CAN HE COME OUT OF IT OK?

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.859
I PLAY THREE CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:36.629
HA! JEAN, YOUR STRATEGY IS
WORKING PERFECTLY SO FAR.

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.131
OF COURSE IT IS.
AFTER ALL,

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.233
JACK'S AS
PREDICTABLE
AS HIS DECK.

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.936
VICTORY IS
ALL BUT ASSURED
NOW, BREO.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:46.539
SO MUCH FOR
THE INFAMOUS TEAM 5D's.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:49.742
Andre, thinking:
JACK'S DOWN, BUT HE'S
NOT OUT. NOT YET.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:50.910
Andre: MY TURN!

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:53.880
FIRST, THE UNI-HORNED
FAMILIAR

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.481
THAT WAS REMOVED
FROM PLAY LAST ROUND

00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.050
RETURNS TO THE FIELD.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.119
SO WELCOME BACK,
MY SINGLE-SPIKED FRIEND.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:07.393
AND NEXT I'LL BE
WELCOMING
UNICORN KNIGHT.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.428
BUT IN ORDER
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:09.996
I MUST RESURRECT
MONOCEROS

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.564
AND THEN
SPECIAL SUMMON HIM.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.334
SO, COME BACK,
MONOCEROS!

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:21.507
NOW APPEAR,
UNICORN KNIGHT.

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:29.148
AND NOW, LEVEL 2
ONE-HORNED FAMILIAR,

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.951
TUNE WITH LEVEL 3
MONOCEROS.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.854
FEEL THE WINDS BLOW

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:38.091
AND WATCH THE STORM
CLOUDS UP ABOVE RUMBLE
WITH ELECTRICITY

00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:39.926
AS I SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.461
THUNDER UNICORN!

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:44.030
[NEIGHING]

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.766
Computer:
THUNDER UNICORN IS

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:47.967
A LIGHT ATTRIBUTE

00:12:47.967 --> 00:12:49.168
BEAST-TYPE MONSTER

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:53.239
WITH 2,200 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1,800 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.575
THAT UNICORN WOULDN'T
SCARE A MOUSE.

00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:58.678
HE'S NO MATCH FOR
MY RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:00.046
VERY TRUE, JACK.

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.214
RIGHT NOW HE'S NOT,

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:03.383
BUT ONCE A TURN,
THUNDER UNICORN CAN LOWER

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.518
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 500

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:07.520
FOR EVERY
NON-THUNDER-UNICORN MONSTER

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.722
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
OUT ON MY FIELD.

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.757
SO WHAT?

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:12.792
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE
NON-THUNDER UNICORN OUT.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.194
DO THE MATH. MY ARCHFIEND
WILL STILL BE STRONGEST.

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:16.696
NOT IF YOU DO
THE MATH

00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:18.665
WITH MONOCEROS'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:21.100
AN ABILITY THAT
I CAN ACTIVATE
FROM MY GRAVE.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.803
YOU SEE, WHEN
MONOCEROS IS USED
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.805
ALONG WITH
A BEAST-TYPE
TUNER MONSTER,

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.107
I CAN THEN RESURRECT
THAT TUNER MONSTER.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:31.311
WELCOME BACK
ONCE AGAIN,
UNI-HORNED FAMILIAR.

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:34.347
NOW THERE ARE

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:36.916
TWO NON-THUNDER
UNICORN MONSTERS
ON MY FIELD...

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.821
MEANING YOUR RED
DRAGON ARCHFIEND'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.090
DECREASE TO 2,000.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.091
NO!

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.560
NOW GO, THUNDER UNICORN.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.295
ATTACK WITH
SUPER CHARGER BOLT!

NO WAY!

MONSTER, AND IT'S
ALREADY DESTROYED?

OH, MY WORD!

JACK!

00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:06.245
STEP OFF, CARLY.

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.513
I'M ROOTING FOR JACK.
GOT IT?

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.848
OH, PLEASE.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.950
I'VE BEEN ROOTING FOR
HIM LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.653

BE QUIET. JACK
IS ALL MINE!

00:14:16.489 --> 00:14:18.825
ANDRE IS SIMPLY
PLAYING LIGHTS OUT.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:22.528
I'D SAY THAT THE DECK
IS A COMPLETE
AND TOTAL SUCCESS SO FAR.

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.863
WOULDN'T
YOU AGREE, JEAN?

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.031
OF COURSE I WOULD.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.467
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.
AFTER ALL, IT TOOK WEEKS OF

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:30.169
METICULOUS STUDY
TO ASSEMBLE THOSE CARDS.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.573
EACH AND EVERY
DUEL SCENARIO ANDRE
MAY ENCOUNTER AGAINST JACK

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:35.808
HAS BEEN THOUGHT OUT
AND PLAYED THROUGH.

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.143
HE HAS NO CHANCE.

00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:38.277

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.545
"NO CHANCE"!

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:42.115
BOY, YOU GIVE ME
GOOSEBUMPS WHEN
YOU TALK LIKE THAT.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.350
[BEEPING]

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.819
YUSEI, TAKE A LOOK.

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:47.954
Yusei: WHAT IS IT?

00:14:47.954 --> 00:14:50.289
Bruno: SOMETHING'S ENTERED
JACK'S AIR INTAKE.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:54.460
YUSEI, IT'S YOUR CALL,
BUT I'D RECOMMEND
TAKING A PIT STOP

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.728
TO CHECK IT OUT.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.363
IT'LL COST US SOME
SPEED COUNTERS,
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:58.531
SAFETY FIRST.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:01.534
Andre: I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:03.970
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE
IS COMING TO AN END--

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.505
YOUR LEAD IN THIS DUEL

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:08.641
BECAUSE THE MASTER OF
FASTER IS ABOUT TO
SHIFT INTO OVERDRIVE.

00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:15.548
OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME. A PIT STOP?

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:18.484
COME ON! I WAS JUST
GETTING FIRED UP!

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.119
THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT!

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.923
UM, EITHER JACK'S BRAKES
AREN'T WORKING

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.491
OR HE'S
COMPLETELY IGNORING US.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.627
I SUMMON MAD ARCHFIEND!

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:35.735
NEXT, I'LL ACTIVATE
THE TRAP
POWERFUL REBIRTH.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.938
NOW I GET TO SUMMON
A LEVEL 4 OR BELOW
MONSTER FROM MY GRAVE.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:43.042
AND THANKS TO REBIRTH,
ITS ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS
EACH GO UP BY A HUNDRED

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.344
AND ITS LEVEL
INCREASES BY ONE.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.448
THE MONSTER I CHOOSE
TO SUMMON IS DARK RESONATOR.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.649
COME ON OUT.

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:57.123
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
ANOTHER TRAP.

00:15:57.123 --> 00:15:59.392
IT'S CALLED RAGE RESYNCHRO.

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:02.094
NOW, BY SENDING MONSTERS
THAT HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.763
A SYNCHRO MONSTER
TO MY GRAVE,

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:06.466
I CAN SUMMON A SYNCHRO
MONSTER FROM MY GRAVE

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.701
WITH A 500-ATTACK-POINT BONUS.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:12.772
SO GO, LEVEL 4 DARK RESONATOR
AND LEVEL 4 MAD ARCHFIEND!

00:16:12.772 --> 00:16:15.174
TO THE GRAVEYARD WITH YOU.

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:16.809
BUT YOUR BANISHING
WON'T BE IN VAIN.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.412
WITH YOUR DEMISE,
NEW LIFE IS GIVEN.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:21.981
AND GIVEN TO A GREAT
AND MIGHTY MONSTER.

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.417
RISE AGAIN,
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:28.087
WHOA. HE'S GOT
3,500 ATTACK POINTS?

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.222
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:32.024
AND HE'S ABOUT TO
USE THEM ALL ON YOU!

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.259
GO, ARCHFIEND.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.962
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN
CARD, DIMENSION TRAP!

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:38.197
NOW BY REMOVING
ONE MONSTER ON MY FIELD

00:16:38.197 --> 00:16:40.199
AND ONE TRAP CARD
IN MY GRAVE FROM PLAY,

00:16:40.199 --> 00:16:43.069
I CAN USE THE EFFECT
OF THE TRAP CARD
I JUST REMOVED.

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:44.270
YOU CAN DO WHAT?!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.005
I NOW REMOVE
UNI-HORNED FAMILIAR

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:49.275
AND DIFFERENT
DIMENSION BARRIER--
LOST FORCE FROM PLAY!

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:52.512
AND NOW I'M ALLOWED
TO USE THE EFFECT
OF LOST FORCE,

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:54.280
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.215
THE ATTACK YOU JUST
WAGED WITH ARCHFIEND

00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:58.117
IS NEGATED AND YOU
TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.353
TO ITS ATTACK
POINTS.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.822
NO, JACK, YOU'VE GOT
TO CALL OFF THE ATTACK!

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:04.891
IF THIS GOES THROUGH,
HE'S FINISHED!

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:08.895
AAH!

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:12.198
BRING IT ON, ANDRE,
BECAUSE THIS TIME
I'M READY.

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:31.284
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP OVERPOWER.

00:17:31.284 --> 00:17:33.853
THIS CARD NEGATES
THE EFFECT OF A CARD

00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:35.621
THAT CANCELS
A MONSTER'S ATTACK,

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.924
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR DIMENSION TRAP.

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:47.833
NOW RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
HAS YOU BACK IN HIS SIGHTS!

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.939
[NEIGHING]

00:17:52.939 --> 00:17:54.640
[GROANING]

00:17:57.343 --> 00:17:58.911
WOW. NOT BAD.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.747
COUNTERATTACKING FROM
THOSE DIRE STRAITS?

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.349
NO, NOT BAD AT ALL.

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:05.217
YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE
JACK SOME CREDIT.

00:18:05.217 --> 00:18:09.355
OH! THAT TOOK SOME
YEARS OFF MY LIFE.

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:10.856
YEAH, THAT WAS
A CLOSE CALL,

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:13.626
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT
WHAT'S BOTHERING
ME MOST RIGHT NOW.

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:14.760
Akiza: WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.162
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT,
YUSEI?

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:18.864
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE TYPE OF DECK
THAT ANDRE'S USING.

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.233
IT'S NOT A POWER DECK
LIKE WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.936
IT'S A DECK BUILT
FOR COUNTERING POWER.

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.805
BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN
YUSEI DUELED HIM?

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:33.646
[MONSTER GROWLING]

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:35.881
WAIT A SECOND.
COULD IT BE
THAT TEAM UNICORN

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:39.218
HAD THIS
ALL PLANNED OUT?

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.753
AND SO FAR
THE SHOW'S GOING

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:42.021
ACCORDING TO SCRIPT.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.791
I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT, CROW.

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:47.927
TEAM UNICORN'S BEEN
PLAYING US FROM THE START.

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.895
PLAYING US
FROM THE START? HOW?

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.330
Yusei: I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.499
IT WASN'T JUST
SOME ACCIDENT THAT THEY
CHALLENGED US TO A DUEL

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.867
AT THAT PRACTICE.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:58.070
WAIT. SO THEN
YOU'RE SAYING WHEN BREO
FELL IN FRONT OF ME,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.238
THAT WAS PLANNED
ON PURPOSE?

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:01.741
YEAH, TO MAKE US
THINK A CERTAIN WAY.

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.476
SAY WHAT?

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.044
TEAM UNICORN WANTED US
TO THINK

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:07.079
THAT ANDRE WOULD BE
DUELING FIRST FOR THEM

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.448
AND BE USING A POWER DECK
IN THAT DUEL.

00:19:09.448 --> 00:19:11.083
BECAUSE IF WE THOUGHT THAT,

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.752
THEN WE WOULD MOST
LIKELY SELECT JACK

00:19:12.752 --> 00:19:14.887
TO BE THE FIRST DUELIST
FOR OUR TEAM.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.255
OF COURSE.

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:18.224
BECAUSE JACK USES
A POWER DECK.

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:20.526
BUT YOU'RE SAYING
TEAM UNICORN
WANTED US TO DO THAT

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:23.763
BECAUSE THEY HAD
A SPECIAL ANTI-POWER DECK
ALL READY TO GO.

00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:26.932
SO THEN, THEY'VE BEEN
PLANNING AND TRAINING
FOR THIS DUEL WITH JACK

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:29.602
SINCE BACK THEN AND
PROBABLY EVEN BEFORE?

00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:31.137
MM-HMM.

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:37.443
JUDGING FROM
THOSE SUSPICIOUS SCOWLS,

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:39.578
I'D SAY THEY JUST REALIZED
HOW WE DUPED THEM.

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.648
SO WHAT? WHAT
CAN THEY DO NOW?

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:45.418
JACK ATLAS'S DEFEAT
IS ALL BUT CERTAIN.

00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:47.019
WAY TO HANG IN THERE.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.588
BUT I WOULDN'T GET
YOUR HOPES UP ABOUT
WINNING THIS OR ANYTHING.

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.390
I MEAN, SURE, YOU
WERE GREAT IN YOUR DAY,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.625
BUT THAT DAY HAS PASSED.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:54.627
NOW YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A WASHED UP HAS-BEEN.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:56.929
HAS-BEEN? YOU
ARROGANT LITTLE PUNK,

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:59.098
I CAN'T WAIT TO MOP
THE FLOOR WITH YOU.

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:02.435
OH, PLEASE.
EVEN YOUR INSULTS
ARE PREDICTABLE.

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.270
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.306
IT MEANS I KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA DO WHAT
YOU JUST DID, JACK.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.575
THAT'S WHY I HAD
THIS CARD READY--

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.677
PARALLEL SELECT.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:12.878
THANKS TO THIS TRAP,

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.081
WHEN A SYNCHRO
MONSTER ON THE
FIELD IS DESTROYED,

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:16.749
I CAN ADD ONE CARD
THAT WAS REMOVED

00:20:16.749 --> 00:20:18.350
FROM PLAY
TO MY HAND.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.786
AND THE CARD
I'M ADDING BACK IS

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.055
THE SPEED SPELL
END OF THE STORM.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:24.056
WHAT?

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.791
NO WAY!

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.461
MY TURN!

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:31.230
JACK'S LIFE POINTS
ARE DOWN TO A MERE 800,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.499
AND ANDRE HAS
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:34.667
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:38.070
I PLAY THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.774
NOW BY REMOVING
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:43.409
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:46.178
FOR EVERY SPEED
SPELL CARD THAT I
POSSESS IN MY HAND.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.183
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU LOSE.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.863
OH, NO!

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:09.602
[ALL GASP]
