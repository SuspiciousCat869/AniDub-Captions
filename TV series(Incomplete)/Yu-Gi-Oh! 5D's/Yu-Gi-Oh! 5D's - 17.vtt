THE REAL HEAT...

00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:46.478
AS I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED BOOSTER
TRAP CARD!

00:08:46.478 --> 00:08:48.780
Duel runner computer:
SPEED BOOSTER ALLOWS YOU
TO DEAL DAMAGE

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.750
EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT'S
SPEED COUNTERS

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.084
MULTIPLIED BY 100.

00:08:57.355 --> 00:08:58.590
MAN, THIS GUY'S QUICK.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.591
[GROANING]

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:04.696
Hunter: WELCOME TO
THE REAL WORLD
OF TURBO DUELING, KID...

00:09:04.696 --> 00:09:07.565
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP,
YOU'RE GONNA GET
LEFT BEHIND...[LAUGHS]

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:22.045
I CAME HERE TO BURN RUBBER
AND TAKE NAMES, YUSEI,

00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:23.880
AND NO ONE IS GONNA
STOP ME FROM WINNING

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.882
THE CHANCE TO RECLAIM MY TITLE.

00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.217
SEE WHEN I WAS
THE NUMBER ONE RANKED

00:09:27.217 --> 00:09:28.718
TURBO DUELIST IN THE WORLD,

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:30.120
I LEARNED TO DEFEND MY TITLE

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.856
BY REPEATEDLY DEFLECTING ATTACKS
FROM ALL DIRECTIONS

00:09:32.856 --> 00:09:34.157
JUST LIKE MY MONSTER,

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.159
BUT I ALSO LEARNED
THAT TO STAY AT THE TOP

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.094
YOU GOTTA DISH OUT DAMAGE
HARD AND FAST

00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:40.030
SO GET READY TO FEEL THE HEAT!

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.765
TALKS A LOT,
DOESN'T HE?

00:09:41.765 --> 00:09:43.199
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S ABLE TO PUT

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:44.734
HIS MONEY WHERE HIS
MOUTH IS IN THIS CASE

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:46.102
'CAUSE HE'S EARNED
A BIG ADVANTAGE.

00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.706
DID YUSEI JUST
CRACK A SMILE?

00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:52.642
I DIDN'T SEE THAT,
IS HE SMILING,

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:54.811
DID YOU SEE HIM SMILE,
WHY WOULD YUSEI SMILE?

00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.879
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:57.047
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

00:09:57.047 --> 00:10:00.250
AND NOW TO TURN UP
THE HEAT SATELLITE...

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.918
I INITIATE SPEED BOOSTER'S
SPECIAL ATTACK!

00:10:07.757 --> 00:10:09.993
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS A WHOLE NEW HUNTER PACE

00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:11.027
WE'RE SEEING!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.996
HE'S TOTALLY REINVENTED HIMSELF.

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:16.833
I'M ON THE FAST TRACK TO GLORY,
NO ONE CAN STOP ME!

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:18.902
DON'T BLINK OR YOU'LL MISS ME!

00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:21.171
I'M BRINGING A WHOLE NEW
INTENSITY TO TURBO DUELING,

00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:26.009
I'M GONNA LEAVE
THE ENTIRE WORLD IN MY DUST,
I'M GONNA... HUH!?

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:27.610
YOU'RE GONNA WHAT?

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.312
HOW ARE YOU KEEPING UP
WITH ME!?

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.681
HUH? SLIP STREAM?!

00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:34.217
AW, MAN YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME!

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.052
IS THAT WHY
HE WAS SMILING?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.254
SURE IS.
YA SEE, SLIP STREAM

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:40.156
IS A GREAT ASSET
IN THIS SITUATION.

00:10:40.156 --> 00:10:42.292
IF YOUR SPEED COUNTER
IS LESS THAN
YOUR OPPONENT'S...

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:44.260
AND YOUR OPPONENT
USES A SPEED SPELL,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.729
YOU CAN ACTIVATE
SLIP STREAM.

00:10:45.729 --> 00:10:47.130
THEN... DURING THE NEXT
STANDBY PHASE,

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.133
YOUR SPEED COUNTERS BECOME
EQUAL TO YOUR OPPONENT'S.

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.835
YUSEI RULES!

00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:54.237
LET'S JUST HOPE
HE MAKES USE
OF THIS POSITION.

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.005
YOU MUST THINK YOU'RE
SLICKER THAN SLICK,
DON'T YOU...

00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:58.141
I DRAW!

00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.809
I'M CRANKIN' THIS DUEL
UP A NOTCH

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:01.311
WITH THE SUMMON
SPEEDER SPELL!

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.014
NOT SO FAST...
I PLAY SLIP STREAM.

00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:06.015
YOU KNOW,
I HEARD SOME PEOPLE

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:08.118
SAYING YOU WERE
GOOD, YUSEI!

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:09.986
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:11.020
TO KEEP UP WITH ME.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.958
I ACTIVATE...
ACCELERATION ZONE!

00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.693
JUST TRY TO CATCH ME NOW!

00:11:19.696 --> 00:11:21.998
YEEEEEEAH!!!

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:24.968
HA HA...

00:11:24.968 --> 00:11:26.669
Announcer: INCREDIBLE!

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:29.806
HUNTER PACE'S SPEED COUNTER
HAS ROCKETED ALL THE WAY TO 11!

00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:35.311
[GRUNTING]
WOOOHOOO!!

00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:37.180
YOU MAY THINK
YOU OUTSMARTED ME

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.616
BY SLIPPING IN YOUR
SLIP STREAM LAST ROUND

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:40.984
BUT MY DECK IS SO FAST

00:11:40.984 --> 00:11:42.619
THAT NO MATTER WHAT CARD
YOU PLAY OR MOVE YOU MAKE,

00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:45.288
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
A STEP BEHIND.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.023
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SATELLITES

00:11:47.023 --> 00:11:48.958
HAVE COME TO EXPECT
ISN'T IT?!

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.827
WELL I WONDER
IF YOU EXPECTED ME

00:11:50.827 --> 00:11:53.296
TO PLAY THIS,
THE SUMMON SPEEDER
SPELL CARD!

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.665
WOAH! YUSEI MET
HUNTER PACE'S CHALLENGE

00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:56.966
WITH A DIRECT COUNTER!

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.301
HMPH!

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.637
Yusei: NOW WITH THE POWER
OF SUMMON SPEEDER...

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.306
I SUMMON QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:06.109
AND JUNK SYNCHRON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:08.878
AND THANKS TO
MY JUNK SYNCHRON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:11.781
I CAN SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:13.783
SO I'M BRINGING BACK...
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:19.823
AND NOW, I TUNE
MY JUNK SYNCHRON

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.324
WITH MY SPEED WARRIOR,

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:22.792
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
JUNK WARRIOR!

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:33.903
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:12:43.713 --> 00:12:45.048
All: ALRIGHT!

00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:46.216
I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY HE'S

00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:47.684
KEEPING PACE
WITH HUNTER!

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:49.085
BUT BEFORE I ATTACK...

00:12:49.085 --> 00:12:51.955
SINCE THE QUILLBOLT
ON MY FIELD IS A LEVEL 2,

00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:53.122
JUNK WARRIOR CAN ABSORB
ITS ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:55.992
IT'S GO TIME!

00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:58.595
HEH!...FORGET MY
SPEED BOOSTER
TRAP ALREADY?

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.534
OH DEAR...

00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:07.103
HOW DID HE STOP
JUNK WARRIOR'S
ATTACK LIKE THAT?

00:13:07.103 --> 00:13:09.505
REMEMBER, WITH THAT
SPEED BOOSTER TRAP CARD,

00:13:09.505 --> 00:13:11.107
HUNTER CAN BLOCK
THE SAME NUMBER OF ATTACKS

00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:13.042
AS THEIR DIFFERENCE
IN SPEED COUNTERS.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.677
OH, RIGHT, SO...
SINCE HUNTER'S
AT 11...

00:13:14.677 --> 00:13:17.847
AND YUSEI'S
AT 6, THEN...

00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:20.750
HUNTER'S ABLE TO DEFLECT
5 OF YUSEI'S ATTACKS?

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.819
I'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO PUSH THROUGH THIS.

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:26.789
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:28.691
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT...

00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:29.692
I DRAW!

00:13:30.827 --> 00:13:33.029
HUNTER IS TOTALLY MAXED OUT!

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:35.865
IT DOESN'T GET ANY FASTER THAN
12 SPEED COUNTERS, PEOPLE!

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.369
AFTER JACK TOOK MY TITLE

00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:41.304
AND I FAILED TO SNATCH IT BACK,

00:13:41.304 --> 00:13:43.673
I WENT INTO HIDING TO UNDERGO
SOME SERIOUS RE-TRAINING,

00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:46.075
AND I REALIZED
THAT IF I WAS GONNA

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:47.844
AGAIN RULE THE TURBO DUELS,

00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:49.012
I HAD TO PUT SPEED FIRST!

00:13:49.012 --> 00:13:51.681
YOU'RE AS GOOD AS DONE
IN A TURBO DUEL

00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:54.083
IF YOU CAN'T FEARLESSLY HARNESS
THE AWESOME POWER OF TRUE SPEED!

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:57.287
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU DO,
IT'S HOW FAST YOU DO IT,

00:13:57.287 --> 00:13:58.621
WHICH I WILL NOW
DEMONSTRATE BY ACTIVATING

00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:01.324
THE ACCELERATE DRAW SPEED SPELL!

00:14:01.324 --> 00:14:03.092
THIS LETS ME DRAW
2 MORE CARDS FROM MY DECK!

00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:07.730
HA HA.
OH... YEA-A-A-AH!

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.165
IT'S IN MY HAND!...

00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:11.501
THE END OF STORM SPELL CARD!

00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:12.769
WHAT?!
HE HAS THE SPELL CARD
END OF STORM?

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.071
SHOULDA STAYED INDOORS
TODAY, YUSEI!...

00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.641
YOUR LOCAL FORECAST CALLS FOR
SOME HARDCORE SCHOOLING

00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:20.043
AND A WHOLE LOTTA LET DOWN.

00:14:20.043 --> 00:14:22.111
WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF ANNIHILATION.

00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:23.880
BUT IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU NOW!

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.983
I ACTIVATE... END OF STORM!

00:14:26.983 --> 00:14:28.885
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,

00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:30.954
YOU AND JACK ATLAS
HAVE SOME HISTORY,

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.989
SO I'M SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS.

00:14:32.989 --> 00:14:35.391
THE STORM DESTROYS
EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:37.827
AND THEN WE BOTH TAKE
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:14:37.827 --> 00:14:39.162
FOR EVERY MONSTER WE HAD.

00:14:39.162 --> 00:14:41.965
[GRUNTING]

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.700
WO... W!

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.103
HUNTER PACE HAS MANAGED TO NAIL
YUSEI FOR 600 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:50.039
BUT IN DOING SO, HE HAD
TO OBLITERATE HIS OWN MONSTER!

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:52.775
HE CAN'T ATTACK NOW!
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

00:14:52.775 --> 00:14:56.279
HEH! NOW THAT THE STORM
HAS BLOWN OVER.

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:59.615
I REMOVE ONE SKULL FLAME
IN MY GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY.

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:01.985
BY DOING SO... I CAN SUMMON

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.520
THE INCREDIBLE
SPEED KING SKULL FLAME

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.257
TO THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE,
3,000 ATTACK POINTS AND ALL!

00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:13.863
OH NO.

00:15:13.863 --> 00:15:15.698
3,000 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:17.934
NOT ONLY DID HUNTER DESTROY
EVERY MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:19.736
AND DEAL DAMAGE TO YUSEI,

00:15:19.736 --> 00:15:22.972
BUT HE'S MANAGED TO SUMMON
AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
NEW MONSTER!

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:25.274
WHAT A STUPENDOUS
STRING OF MOVES!

00:15:25.274 --> 00:15:27.276
THIS COULD BE THE END
OF THE DUEL RIGHT HERE!

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:29.746
HUNTER PACE MAY BE MOVING ON
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:32.181
AND JACK ATLAS MAY BE GETTING
A LITTLE SCARED RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:15:46.591 --> 00:15:47.626
THIS DUEL IS OVER YUSEI!

00:15:47.626 --> 00:15:49.227
'CAUSE SPEED KING
SKULL FLAME

00:15:49.227 --> 00:15:50.895
IS GONNA
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:15:52.831 --> 00:15:56.234
WELL MY SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW
SHOULD EXTINGUISH ITS ATTACK!

00:15:56.234 --> 00:16:00.205
YUSEI HAS SHIELDED HIMSELF
FROM HUNTER'S SKULL FLAME!

00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:03.241
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU DO WHEN I
ACTIVATE SPEED BOOSTER AGAIN!

00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:11.016
[GRUNTING]

00:16:11.016 --> 00:16:12.017
OH NO!

00:16:12.017 --> 00:16:13.785
STAY STRONG, YUSEI!

00:16:13.818 --> 00:16:17.922
AND NOW I ACTIVATE SPEED KING
SKULL FLAME'S SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:16:17.922 --> 00:16:20.358
SO FOR EVERY BURNING SKULLHEAD
IN MY GRAVEYARD...

00:16:20.358 --> 00:16:22.193
YOU TAKE 400 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.399
Announcer: YUSEI IS
BARELY HOLDING ON

00:16:27.399 --> 00:16:28.400
WITH A MEASLY 400 LIFE POINTS.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.870
CAN HE SURVIVE?

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.438
[THINKING] COME ON YUSEI,

00:16:33.438 --> 00:16:35.307
SHOW ME
YOUR MARK OF THE DRAGON...

00:16:36.574 --> 00:16:39.077
IF WE CONFIRM THAT
YUSEI'S A SIGNER,

00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:41.579
SHALL I HAVE HIM
BROUGHT TO YOU
DIRECTOR?

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:44.883
Yusei: IT'S MY TURN!

00:16:44.883 --> 00:16:47.519
FIRST, I'M GONNA SLOW THIS DUEL
DOWN A LITTLE BIT...

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:49.387
WITH SHIFT DOWN!

00:16:49.387 --> 00:16:51.156
Announcer:
IN A QUESTIONABLE MOVE,

00:16:51.156 --> 00:16:53.625
YUSEI HAS INTENTIONALLY
DECREASED HIS SPEED COUNTERS.

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.560
WHAT COULD HE BE THINKING?

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.095
MAYBE HE
ISN'T THINKING.

00:16:57.095 --> 00:16:58.763
HE MUST BE BANKING ON
HIS DECK RIGHT NOW.

00:16:58.763 --> 00:17:00.999
BANKING ON
HIS DECK?

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:04.002
THAT'S RIGHT...
SHIFT DOWN MAY FORCIBLY

00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:05.870
LOWER YOUR
SPEED COUNTERS BY 6,

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.839
BUT THE UPSIDE IS THAT
IT LETS YOU DRAW 2 CARDS

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.207
FROM THE TOP OF YOUR DECK.

00:17:09.207 --> 00:17:10.975
I GET IT...
HE'S HOPING HE CAN

00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:12.377
BUST OUT A GAME CHANGER.

00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:14.079
EXACTLY.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.848
OUR FRIEND YUSEI NEVER STOPS
BELIEVING IN HIS CARDS.

00:17:20.418 --> 00:17:24.055
NOW THAT MY SPEED HAS DECREASED,
I CAN DRAW 2 MORE CARDS.

00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:27.625
AND NEXT, I SUMMON
NITRO SYNCHRON.

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.361
NOW THAT I'VE GOT A TUNER
MONSTER ON MY FIELD...

00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:33.164
I CAN BRING QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
BACK FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:39.037
WITH THAT DONE, I'M ACTIVATING
THE GIVE AND TAKE TRAP CARD.

00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:40.271
Duel runner computer:
THE GIVE AND TAKE TRAP CARD

00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:42.240
SUMMONS A MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.775
TO YOUR OPPONENT'S FIELD.

00:17:43.808 --> 00:17:45.477
THE LEVEL OF THAT MONSTER
IS THEN ADDED

00:17:45.477 --> 00:17:47.846
TO A MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD.

00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.382
SO NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOUR DEFENSE A LITTLE BOOST

00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:53.318
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE POWER
THAT BEAST POSSESSES!

00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:54.319
YOU'RE DOING WHAT?

00:17:55.587 --> 00:17:56.588
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
AT THE TOP OF THE RANKS

00:17:56.588 --> 00:17:58.089
BACK IN THE DAY HUNTER,

00:17:58.089 --> 00:18:00.992
BUT THAT'S ONLY 'CAUSE
YOU NEVER FACED BEASTS

00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:03.194
WITH ABILITIES
LIKE THESE.

00:18:03.194 --> 00:18:06.030
SO WITH QUILLBOLT
HEDGEHOG BUMPED UP
TO LEVEL 5

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.166
AND NITRO SYNCHRON
ALREADY AT LEVEL 2,
THEN HE......

00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:10.435
CAN SYNCHRO SUMMON
A LEVEL 7 MONSTER!

00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:13.538
NOW I TUNE MY NITRO SYNCHRON
AND MY QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

00:18:13.538 --> 00:18:16.274
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON NITRO WARRIOR!

00:18:18.777 --> 00:18:20.945
LET'S REV IT UP ONE MORE TIME!

00:18:26.217 --> 00:18:29.120
PRETTY COOL MONSTER, BUT...
I CAN DEFLECT YOUR ATTACK

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.388
WITH SPEED BOOSTER,

00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:32.190
SO THERE WAS NO POINT
IN SUMMONING THAT THING!

00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:35.160
I WONDER IF HUNTER
KNOWS THAT

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.327
SYNCHRO SUMMONING
NITRO WARRIOR

00:18:36.327 --> 00:18:37.862
HAS ENABLED YUSEI
TO DRAW ANOTHER CARD

00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:40.165
FROM THE TOP
OF HIS DECK.

00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:41.933
IS THAT WHY YUSEI
SUMMONED IT?

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:43.001
YOU GOT IT.

00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:44.469
HE'S TRYING TO GET
TO A CERTAIN CARD.

00:18:46.304 --> 00:18:47.772
CHECK IT OUT, YUSEI!

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:50.775
I'M SO MUCH FASTER,
I'M ABOUT
TO LAP YOU...

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:51.943
HEH, HEH, HEH!!

00:18:51.943 --> 00:18:53.178
[THINKING] I CAN DO THIS...

00:19:06.991 --> 00:19:09.027
JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

00:19:09.027 --> 00:19:11.062
I'M ACTIVATING THE SPEED
SPELL... GAP STORM!

00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:14.999
WHAT IS THIS?

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:16.401
I CAN ONLY
ACTIVATE GAP STORM

00:19:16.401 --> 00:19:17.402
WHEN THE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR SPEED COUNTERS IS

00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:19.370
10 OR MORE,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.039
THAT'S WHY I SLOWED DOWN.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:24.075
NOW I CAN DESTROY EVERY TRAP
AND SPELL CARD ON THE FIELD.

00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:26.110
OH, NO, SO
THAT MEANS...

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.147
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR SPEED BOOSTER!

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:32.383
WOW, TALK ABOUT A BIG-TIME RISK
ACTUALLY PAYING OFF.

00:19:32.383 --> 00:19:34.586
HOW IRONIC... HE MIGHT
MANAGE TO WIN
A GAME OF SPEED

00:19:34.586 --> 00:19:35.587
BY SLOWING DOWN.

00:19:37.455 --> 00:19:40.225
THIS AIN'T OVER.

00:19:40.225 --> 00:19:43.495
IT WILL BE ONCE NITRO'S
SPECIAL ABILITY KICKS IN!

00:19:43.495 --> 00:19:44.496
AND BECAUSE I ACTIVATED
A SPELL CARD

00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:46.798
ON MY OWN TURN...

00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:48.266
MY NITRO WARRIOR
GETS HOOKED UP

00:19:48.266 --> 00:19:49.567
WITH 1,000
ATTACK POINTS.

00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:50.835
WHA-HA-HA?!

00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:53.271
NITRO... ATTACK WITH
DYNAMITE CRUNCH!!

00:20:06.184 --> 00:20:07.552
I'M STILL AHEAD!

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:09.020
NOT FOR LONG!

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.622
YOU SEE HUNTER,
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD THE LEAD

00:20:10.622 --> 00:20:12.056
FOR MOST OF THE DUEL

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:14.225
YOUR LIFE POINTS ARE
ABOUT TO RUN OUT OF GAS

00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:15.326
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF

00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:17.962
MY NITRO WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:17.962 --> 00:20:19.964
WAIT, SO...
MY JUNK SYNCHRON'S

00:20:19.964 --> 00:20:21.566
SWITCHED TO
ATTACK MODE?

00:20:21.566 --> 00:20:24.202
BUT THAT MEANS...
IT CAN'T PROTECT ME!

00:20:24.202 --> 00:20:25.937
NITRO ATTACK!
AAH!

00:20:25.937 --> 00:20:28.339
YUSEI IS
ABOUT TO PULL OFF A MAJOR
COME-FROM-BEHIND VICTORY!

00:20:32.076 --> 00:20:33.077
CAN'T WE BE FRIENDS?

00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:39.484
IT'S OVE... R!
THERE'S JUST NO LOVE

00:20:39.484 --> 00:20:41.252
FOR THE ONE-TIME CHAMPION
THESE DAYS.

00:20:41.252 --> 00:20:43.288
HIS DREAM GOES UP
IN SMOKE AGAIN!

00:20:43.288 --> 00:20:44.455
YUSEI DID IT!

00:20:44.455 --> 00:20:45.857
I JUST KNEW
HE COULD DO IT!

00:20:45.857 --> 00:20:46.858
THAT WAS
INCREDIBLE.

00:20:49.827 --> 00:20:53.865
[LAUGHING]

00:20:53.865 --> 00:20:55.066
OH, YEAH...

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:58.403
THAT WAS A REALLY
GREAT DUEL, HUNTER.

00:20:58.403 --> 00:20:59.771
DON'T THINK
I'LL TAKE THIS LOSS

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:01.773
SITTIN' DOWN, YUSEI.

00:21:01.806 --> 00:21:04.142
I PROB'LY SHOULDA
STOOD UP BEFORE
I SAID THAT.

00:21:04.142 --> 00:21:06.210
MAN, I THOUGHT
I HAD YA!

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.112
[LAUGHING]

00:21:13.418 --> 00:21:16.487
Zigzix: OH, NOTHING.

00:21:16.487 --> 00:21:19.557
HUNTER WAS TOO WEAK
TO BRING OUT
YUSEI'S SIGN.

00:21:19.557 --> 00:21:21.793
HIS NEXT OPPONENT
SHOULD TRY BREAKING HIM

00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:23.361
INSTEAD OF BENDING HIM.

00:21:23.361 --> 00:21:25.563
[LAUGHS]

00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:27.198
THIS TOURNAMENT
ISN'T JUST ABOUT

00:21:27.198 --> 00:21:29.567
WINNING THE CHANCE
TO DUEL ME, IS IT?

00:21:29.567 --> 00:21:31.035
WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON HERE?!

00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:32.070
WHAT DO YOU
NEED YUSEI

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.272
TO HELP YOU
DO ANYWAY?!

00:21:34.272 --> 00:21:39.877
Goodwin: ALL IN DUE TIME, JACK.
ALL IN DUE TIME. [LAUGHS]
