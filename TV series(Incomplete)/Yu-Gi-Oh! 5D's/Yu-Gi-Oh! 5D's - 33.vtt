00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.786
THEY'RE HERE...

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.628
Magician: CUT THE POWER!

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:07.038
AAH!
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING,
ARE YOU?

00:10:08.506 --> 00:10:11.008
THE FUN'S
JUST ABOUT TO START.

00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:13.911
[GRRR]

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:16.214
HMPH!

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:22.787
THE LOSER'S DUEL DISK
IS DESTROYED.

00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:25.456
AND UNTIL WE HAVE
A WINNER...

00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:27.758
NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE.

00:10:28.726 --> 00:10:30.127
WHO ARE YOU?

00:10:31.662 --> 00:10:33.130
YUSEI...

00:10:34.632 --> 00:10:35.299

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:49.146
Jack: STOP!

00:10:50.414 --> 00:10:52.016
I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE
WITHOUT THANKING YOU...

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:54.185
FOR TAKING CARE
OF MY FRIEND.

00:10:55.486 --> 00:10:56.487
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

00:10:57.455 --> 00:10:58.122

00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:45.102

I'M THE GUY
WHO'S GONNA

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:51.642
YOU AND YOUR FAKE
MAGICIAN FRIENDS

00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:53.110
HAVE BEEN MAKING
LIFE MISERABLE

00:11:53.511 --> 00:11:54.712
FOR PEOPLE IN
THE FLEET DISTRICT.

00:11:54.979 --> 00:11:57.548
THAT'S GONNA END
HERE AND NOW.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:13.633
Kalin: YOUR
HOCUS POCUS DAYS

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:14.968

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.542

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:26.513
YOU'RE GONNA

00:12:28.848 --> 00:12:29.516

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.186

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:35.055

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.885
AGAINST MY HATE BUSTER

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.094

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:16.863
Kalin: AND PRESTO!
THIS DUEL'S OVER.

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:21.334
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE LIKE A RABBIT
AND DISAPPEAR.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.003
Yusei: KALIN.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:25.872
Kalin: NICE JOB, CROW.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:27.807
SORRY YOU HAD TO BE THE BAIT.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.977
Crow: NEXT TIME--DON'T DELAY
THE SURPRISE ENTRANCE SO MUCH?

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:32.846
Kalin: YOU GOT IT.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.116
THAT GANG WAS
THE LAST OF 'EM...

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:39.686
DONE!

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:41.287
THE FLEET DISTRICT
IS OFFICIALLY
SAFE...

00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:44.390
THANKS TO
THE ENFORCERS.

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:47.761
[SNICKERS]

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:51.731
SOMETHING FUNNY?

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.501
WE HAD FUN...
WAY BACK IN
THE DAY...DIDN'T WE?

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.936
DIDN'T WE, CROW?

00:13:57.837 --> 00:13:59.239
AND JACK!?--
DIDN'T WE
HAVE A BLAST?!

00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:01.975
BUT NOW THAT'S
ALL GONNA END!

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:04.911
SO UH...I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
FRIENDS ANYMORE?...

00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:09.315
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.719
Jack: WHEN I WAS GROWING UP...

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.020
SATELLITE WAS A ROUGH PLACE.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.022
ROUGHER THAN IT IS NOW.

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.757
EVERY DISTRICT WAS
OVERRUN BY DUEL GANGS.

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:21.327
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE,
YOU FOUND FRIENDS...

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.297
YOU STUCK TOGETHER...
AND YOU LAID LOW...

00:14:25.932 --> 00:14:27.333
I HAD YUSEI...AND CROW...
AND KALIN...

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:29.836
THEY WERE MY FRIENDS.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.572
WE HUNG OUT TOGETHER...
WE LOOKED OUT FOR EACH OTHER...

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:35.341
AND FOR EVERYBODY ELSE
IN OUR DISTRICT...

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.881
AND THEN ONE DAY, KALIN DECIDED
HE WAS DONE LAYING LOW.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.218
HE DECIDED IT WAS
TIME TO FIGHT BACK.

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:48.321
THE BISHOPS ARE HAVING
A LITTLE GET TOGETHER TONIGHT

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:49.389
IN CHECKER SQUARE.

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:52.659
TIME TO LET THEM KNOW THEY CAN'T
HAVE THE COURT DISTRICT ANYMORE.

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:56.496
Jack: AT FIRST, OUR ONLY GOAL
WAS TO MAKE OUR DISTRICT

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:57.797
A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE...

00:14:58.631 --> 00:14:59.632
BUT THEN KALIN GOT AMBITIOUS.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.302
HE DECIDED WE NEEDED
TO RID THE SATELLITE

00:15:02.602 --> 00:15:03.603
OF ALL THE DUEL GANGS.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:07.507
YOU GUYS READY TO GO
TAKE DOWN THE AMBULATORS?

00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:09.909
YEAH.

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.145
WE CAN DREAM ALL WE WANT TO,

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:13.746
BUT WE'RE NEVER GETTIN'
OUTTA THE SATELLITE, BOYS.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.116
SO WE NEED TO MAKE
THE SATELLITE THE PLACE TO BE!

00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:19.118
WE NEED TO WIPE OUT
THESE DUEL GANGS

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.254
AND MAKE THE STREETS
SAFE FOR EVERYONE!

00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:23.256
Jack: KALIN INSPIRED US...

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.892
HE TAUGHT US TO BELIEVE
IN OURSELVES.

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:28.061
HE SHOWED US THAT
WE HAD THE POWER

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:28.862
TO CHANGE OUR SITUATION

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:31.397
AND THAT WE COULD CONTROL
OUR OWN DESTINIES.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.467
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
HE WAS OUR LEADER.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.202
AT THE TIME, WE WOULD'VE
FOLLOWED HIM ANYWHERE.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:41.040
TIME FOR THE ENFORCERS
TO DO SOME ENFORCING!

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.448
[CHUCKLES]

00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:49.916
Jack: THINGS WERE GOING GREAT...

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.551
SATELLITE'S DISTRICTS
WERE STARTING TO BECOME SAFE.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.656
BUT THEN...KALIN
TOOK THINGS TOO FAR...

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:21.582
Kalin: YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE
BETRAYED ME, YUSEI.

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.085
Yusei: YOU HAD TO BE
STOPPED, KALIN.

00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:26.954
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
SATELLITE A BETTER PLACE!

00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:28.856
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SECTOR SECURITY

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:31.292
HAD OUR BEST INTEREST
IN MIND?

00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:32.727
WELL, NO, BUT...

00:16:32.727 --> 00:16:35.129
THEY NEEDED TO FALL,
LIKE THE DUEL GANGS!

00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:37.632
SATELLITE NEEDED TO BE
OURS AND OURS ALONE.

00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:40.268
BUT--THE PAST
IS ANCIENT HISTORY,

00:16:40.268 --> 00:16:42.603
LET'S START TALKING
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

00:16:42.603 --> 00:16:45.239
I'M GOING TO SEND YOU
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:52.179
COME ON--LET'S DUEL!

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:58.586
KALIN--WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

00:16:58.586 --> 00:17:00.755
HOW DID YOU BECOME
A DARK SIGNER?

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:04.859
[LAUGHS]
ARE YOU SCARED, YUSEI!?

00:17:06.027 --> 00:17:07.428
NO!

00:17:12.934 --> 00:17:14.135
IN THE FIELD SPELL--
SPEED WORLD!

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.171

AUTOPILOT STANDING BY.

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.182
KALIN, TALK TO ME--
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.117
[LAUGHS]

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:33.187
IT'S A LITTLE
LATE IN THE GAME

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:34.188
TRYING TO PLAY
CATCH-UP, YUSEI!

00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:36.991
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE,
AND THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

00:17:38.426 --> 00:17:39.627
THE ONLY THING
LEFT TO DO...

00:17:40.094 --> 00:17:41.295
IS FOR ME TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:17:41.729 --> 00:17:43.531
SO--WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
IF I LOSE THIS DUEL?

00:17:45.066 --> 00:17:46.267
DO I BECOME ONE OF YOU?

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:48.602
NOT QUITE...BUT
YOU WILL BE CONSUMED.

00:17:50.004 --> 00:17:51.806
YOU'LL BE IMMERSED,
IN THE SHADOWS
OF THE NETHERWORLD.

00:17:53.374 --> 00:17:54.575
Yusei: THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN!

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:58.112
I'M GONNA PUT
A STOP TO YOU
AND SAVE THE SATELLITE.

00:18:00.214 --> 00:18:01.749
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:08.022
MINA--DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:09.924
THEIR PLAY-BY-PLAY
UP ON THE MONITOR?

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:11.759
YES--I CAN DO THAT.

00:18:12.493 --> 00:18:14.795
JUST NEED TO LOCK IN
TO THEIR FREQUENCIES.

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:26.907
YUSEI...BE CAREFUL...

00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:29.510
LET'S GO.

00:18:30.011 --> 00:18:31.012
YES--TIME TO BEGIN
THIS THING!

00:18:33.014 --> 00:18:34.415
TIME FOR THE ENFORCERS
TO RIDE AGAIN!

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:36.250
[LAUGHS]

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:39.453
IT'S MY TURN!

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:42.723
I SUMMON INFERNALTY BEAST!

00:18:46.727 --> 00:18:48.529
Duel runner computer:
INFERNALTY BEAST IS A LEVEL 3

00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:49.764
DARK ATTRIBUTE
BEAST TYPE MONSTER

00:18:50.664 --> 00:18:52.466
THAT HAS 1600 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1200 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.370
AND NOW THAT I'VE
GOT HIM ON THE FIELD,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.672
I THINK I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN!

00:19:00.107 --> 00:19:00.775
COME, YUSEI!

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:03.010
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS DUEL

00:19:03.244 --> 00:19:04.445
FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME...

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:06.380
DON'T LET ME DOWN!

00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:07.581
GIMME EVERYTHING

I SUMMON SPEED WARRIOR

00:19:19.293 --> 00:19:20.895
AND DURING THE BATTLE PHASE
OF THIS TURN--

00:19:21.762 --> 00:19:22.963
SPEED WARRIOR'S ATTACK POINTS
ARE DOUBLED!

00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:26.233
SPEED WARRIOR MOVE IN

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:29.336
AND SEND THAT BEAST

NOT SO FAST YUSEI!

00:19:33.674 --> 00:19:34.875
I PLAY THE TRAP
DEPTH AMULET!

00:19:36.177 --> 00:19:37.578
BY DISCARDING ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND,

00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:40.614
I CAN NEGATE
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK!

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:42.316
[LAUGHS]

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.718
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE STILL
PLAYING THE SAME OLD CARDS.

00:19:45.686 --> 00:19:46.487
I EXPECTED MORE YUSEI!

00:19:47.621 --> 00:19:48.289
OH, YEAH?

00:19:48.756 --> 00:19:50.357
AND HOW HAVE YOU
CHANGED UP YOURS, KALIN?

00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:51.859
[LAUGHS]

00:19:52.393 --> 00:19:54.462
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:58.466
WELL IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL PLAY TWO FACEDOWNS

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.268
AND END MY TURN.

00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:05.005

00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:29.763
DON'T SPIN OUT OF CONTROL!

00:20:33.367 --> 00:20:35.136
THE POWERS OF THE DARK SHADOWS
REALLY SUIT ME!

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.171
DUELS ARE MUCH MORE EXCITING

00:20:37.438 --> 00:20:39.740
WHEN I CAN DISH OUT REAL PAIN!

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.311

HANG ON, PAL!

00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:02.263
[LAUGHS]

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.168
[LAUGHS]

00:21:08.602 --> 00:21:09.603
HEY, YUSEI--HERE'S
A HELPING HAND!

00:21:11.338 --> 00:21:13.541
TOO BAD, THE ONLY ONE
IT'S GOING TO HELP IS ME.

00:21:14.375 --> 00:21:17.845
NOW PREPARE TO BE ABSORBED
INTO THE NETHERWORLD...
