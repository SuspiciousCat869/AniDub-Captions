OF THE NETHERWORLD
FAST APPROACHES,

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:07.875
AND WHEN HE ARRIVES,
YOU CAN BE SURE

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.444
THAT ALL YOU SEE AROUND YOU
WILL BE DESTROYED

00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:14.147
SO THAT I CAN CREATE
A NEW WORLD TO RULE!

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.473
TO POWER UP
THAT MONSTROSITY.

ABOUT TO ROUT
YUSEI'S LIFE POINTS!

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:54.054
DON'T THINK SO!
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN
CARD... LIFE EXCHANGE!

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.090
WITH THIS TRAP,
IF LIFE POINTS CHANGE
DUE TO A CARD EFFECT,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.159
I BECOME THE NEW TARGET
OF THAT EFFECT!

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.129

OH, NO! CROW!

YOU CAN FEND OFF
THOSE MINIONS ALL YOU WANT,

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:42.189
BUT THE KING OF THE NETHERWORLD
WILL STILL ARRIVE HERE
AT THIS ANCIENT TEMPLE,

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.293
AND KNOW THAT WHEN HE DOES,
THE WORLD AS YOU KNOW IT
WILL BE GONE!

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.894
NOT IF WE WIN
THIS MATCH!

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.832
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!
SO QUIT YOUR BLABBING
AND LET'S FINISH THIS!

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:53.366

[THINKING]
JACK'S FIELD IS EMPTY.

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.773
THAT MEANS GOODWIN'S
GONNA BE AIMING FOR HIM.

00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:21.343
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD...
FIENDISH CHAIN!

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:24.379
THIS NEGATES SUN DRAGON
INTI'S SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.882
AND MAKES IT
SO IT CAN'T ATTACK
OR BE SACRIFICED!

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:33.421
YES! NOW THAT SUN DRAGON
WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTACK
JACK'S LIFE POINTS.

00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:35.657
BUT WAIT.

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:40.328
OH, LITTLE JACK.
SO MUCH TO LEARN.

00:04:40.328 --> 00:04:41.730
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU

"GIVE UP
YOUR LONER WAYS,"
AS YOU PUT IT.

AND NOW YOU'LL PAY
FOR THEM,

00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:50.271
AND PAY DEARLY.

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:53.041
OF COURSE, THE IRONY
IN ALL OF THIS IS
THAT EVEN THOUGH

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.609
YOU'VE COMMITTED
YOURSELF
TO YOUR FRIENDS,

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:57.112
YOU'LL BE PAYING

YES, THAT'S RIGHT, JACK,

00:05:33.648 --> 00:05:37.819
AND THAT MEANS
MY SUN DRAGON INTI IS FREE!

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.488
AND THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD
IS THAT MUCH CLOSER

00:05:40.488 --> 00:05:42.991

THAT I'VE CHECKED OUT
OF THIS DUEL.

KNOW THAT I'LL BE THERE
IF YOU NEED ME, OLD FRIEND.

DOWN FOR THE COUNT,

AND THIS TURN
I CHOOSE TO REMOVE
SUN DRAGON INTI!

00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:23.324

I DIDN'T HAVE THIS:

OF BAIMASSE!

ANGEL BATON FROM MY HAND!

AND SINCE I HAVE TWO
OR MORE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:09:00.088 --> 00:09:02.457
I GET TO DRAW TWO CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:09:02.457 --> 00:09:05.693
NOW I PICK ONE
TO KEEP AND ONE TO
SEND TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:08.863
NEXT, I'LL SUMMON
THE TUNER MONSTER

00:09:11.432 --> 00:09:13.701
AND SINCE DEBRIS DRAGON
WAS CALLED OUT,

00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:16.337
I'M ALLOWED TO BRING BACK
A MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:19.040
AS LONG AS IT HAS 500
OR LESS ATTACK POINTS,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.409
SO I BRING BACK YOU,
SONIC CHICK!

00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:24.545
AND NOW, I TUNE MY
LEVEL 4 DEBRIS DRAGON

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:27.815
WITH LEVEL 1 SONIC CHICK
AND LEVEL 3 SHIELD WARRIOR,

00:09:27.849 --> 00:09:31.886
TO SYNCRO SUMMON

00:09:33.888 --> 00:09:35.590
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.258

THAT BEAST DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS
TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE!

00:09:43.998 --> 00:09:47.101
WRONG! LIKE I SAID,
THIS BEAST IS LIKE
THE BOND WE SHARE!

WAIT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:09:48.603 --> 00:09:51.906
I MEAN I'M USING
THE EFFECT OF THE TRAP
CROW LEFT BEHIND.

00:09:54.309 --> 00:09:56.811
NOW, BY SENDING
BLACKWING ANCHOR
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:56.844 --> 00:10:01.015
STARDUST DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS INCREASE
BY 2,500 FOR THIS TURN.

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:04.252
WHAT?!
THAT'S WHY CROW
RELEASED BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER

00:10:04.252 --> 00:10:08.790
WITH HIS LAST MOVE...
NOT FOR HIMSELF,
BUT FOR THE TEAM!

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.058
AND NOW,

00:10:10.058 --> 00:10:12.894
SINCE STARDUST
DRAGON IS STRONGER
THAN EVER BEFORE,

00:10:12.894 --> 00:10:17.031
I'LL HAVE HIM ATTACK
SUN DRAGON INTI!

00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:24.539
FOOL! ANY MONSTER
THAT DESTROYS INTI
IS ALSO DESTROYED,

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:28.376
AND THEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE
EQUAL TO YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:28.376 --> 00:10:31.012
ACTUALLY, GOODWIN,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:33.681
THANKS TO
STARDUST DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.718
IF I RELEASE HIM,
THEN INTI'S EFFECT
IS NEGATED!

00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:41.589
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
I LIKE TO CALL
VICTIM'S SANCTUARY!

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:45.026
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,
YUSEI, BUT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:47.428
WHENEVER SUN DRAGON INTI
IS DESTROYED,

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:51.265
I'M THEN ALLOWED TO
RESURRECT HIS COUNTERPART
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:55.536
COME FORTH,
MOON DRAGON QUILLA!

00:10:55.536 --> 00:10:56.904
NOT THIS TIME, GOODWIN.

00:10:56.904 --> 00:10:58.639
HUH?

00:11:01.876 --> 00:11:03.511
WAIT.
IS THAT JACK'S CARD?

00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:05.013
TOLD YA, GOODWIN.

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:06.681
OUR BOND IS POWERFUL!

00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:11.119
THANKS TO JACK, I NOW PLAY
THE TRAP CONQUEST OF
THE SUPREME RULER!

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:13.821
NOW, BY SENDING THIS CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:13.855 --> 00:11:18.059
YOU'RE NO LONGER
ALLOWED TO SUMMON
MOON DRAGON QUILLA!

00:11:19.193 --> 00:11:21.062
NO, BUT...
BUT NOTHING!

00:11:21.062 --> 00:11:22.797
AND NOW, SINCE I'M
ENDING MY TURN,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.466
STARDUST DRAGON
RESURRECTS FROM
MY GRAVEYARD.

00:11:25.466 --> 00:11:28.569
[ROARS]

00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:30.304
WELCOME BACK, FRIEND.

00:11:30.304 --> 00:11:31.806
GOODWIN! I WARNED YOU

00:11:31.806 --> 00:11:34.275
ABOUT THE POWER OF
THE BOND BETWEEN US ALL.

00:11:34.275 --> 00:11:37.979
NOW, PERHAPS YOU'LL
FINALLY BELIEVE ME!

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:39.480
NO, I REFUSE!

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.316
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS PEOPLE SHARING A BOND!

00:11:42.316 --> 00:11:44.819
MAYBE ONCE I THOUGHT
THAT THERE COULD BE,

00:11:44.852 --> 00:11:46.320
BUT NOW I KNOW BETTER

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.024
AND THE ONLY THING I BELIEVE IN
IS THE POWER OF MY TWO MARKS!

00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:51.492
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:11:51.492 --> 00:11:53.428
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL
CONNECTED TO ROMAN!

00:11:53.428 --> 00:11:54.462
WHAT?

00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:55.863
THAT'S WHY YOU BUILT
THAT BRIDGE...

00:11:55.863 --> 00:11:58.800
BECAUSE HE TRUSTED YOU
AND YOU WANTED TO
FULFILL HIS DREAMS.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.003
MAYBE YOU FAILED, BUT
I KNOW THERE IS STILL
THAT DREAM IN YOU.

00:12:02.003 --> 00:12:04.939
I KNOW YOU TWO STILL
SHARE THAT BOND.

00:12:07.742 --> 00:12:09.877
ROMAN.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.584
Yusei: AND YOU GET MORE
STRENGTH AND POWER FROM HIM
THAN WITH THOSE TWO MARKS!

00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:18.820
NO, IT'S NOT TRUE!

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.223
YOU'RE LYING,
TRYING TO CONFUSE ME
SO YOU CAN WIN!

00:12:22.223 --> 00:12:25.626
BUT IT WON'T WORK! THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD APPROACHES,

00:12:25.626 --> 00:12:28.596
AND YOU THREE ONLY HAVE
ONE LIFE POINT LEFT EACH
TO STOP HIM

00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:32.600
FROM DESTROYING
THIS MISERABLE WORLD AND
LEAVING ME ALL-POWERFUL!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.936
YOU ARE DOOMED!

00:12:51.827 --> 00:12:53.996
Goodwin: RIDE AS FAST
AS YOU CAN, YUSEI.

00:12:53.996 --> 00:12:56.198
THERE IS NO ESCAPING
YOUR FATE.

00:12:56.198 --> 00:12:59.435
YOU AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS SHALL
BE SENT TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:00.736
[SINISTER LAUGHTER]

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.506
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:06.242
AND YOUR TURN, YUSEI, TO LOSE!

00:13:06.242 --> 00:13:09.879
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!
ATTACK YUSEI DIRECTLY!

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:11.747
WITH ONE LIFE POINT LEFT,

00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:14.416
NOW MAY BE A GOOD TIME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE!

00:13:14.416 --> 00:13:17.820
UNLEASH YOUR FURY, RASCA!

00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:19.722
[ROARS]

00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:23.893
Jack: YUSEI!
HUH?

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:28.130
QUICKLY! MY CARD!
USE IT RIGHT NOW!

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.001
THAT'S RIGHT! YOU THREW
A FACEDOWN DURING YOUR
LAST TURN, DIDN'T YOU?

00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:34.003
AGAIN, GOODWIN,

00:13:34.003 --> 00:13:36.205
THE STRENGTH OF
OUR BOND IS PROVEN!

00:13:36.205 --> 00:13:39.341
AND NOW, I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP SCRUBBED RAID!

00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:42.111
THIS ALLOWS ME TO PUT
AN END TO THIS TURN'S
BATTLE PHASE

00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:46.448
SIMPLY BY SENDING
A CARD ON MY FIELD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:46.448 --> 00:13:50.152
WHICH MEANS YOUR
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CAN'T ATTACK!

00:13:51.887 --> 00:13:56.592
HUH! IN THAT CASE,
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP,
METEOR FLARE!

00:13:56.592 --> 00:13:59.495
NOW, BY SENDING TWO CARDS
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:02.231
YOU'RE DEALT
2,000 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:04.667
Yusei: WRONG, BECAUSE
I ACTIVATE JOINT FUTURE!

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.703
WITH THIS, I SEND
ONE CARD IN MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:14:07.703 --> 00:14:09.972
AND YOUR TRAP'S EFFECT
IS NEGATED!

00:14:09.972 --> 00:14:12.975
MAYBE, BUT METEOR FLARE STILL
GETS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:16.512
WHICH MEANS, SINCE IT'S STILL
THE DRAW PHASE OF MY TURN,

00:14:16.512 --> 00:14:19.915
I'M ALLOWED TO ADD IT
RIGHT BACK TO MY HAND!

00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:22.518
'FRAID NOT, GOODWIN!

00:14:22.518 --> 00:14:25.020
ANY CARD WHOSE EFFECT IS
NEGATED BY JOINT FUTURE

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.122
IS RETURNED TO THE DECK,
WHICH IS THEN SHUFFLED.

00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:30.192
WHAT?!
[GRUNTS]

00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:35.264
[GRUNTS]
I END MY TURN.

00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:39.034
DO YOU SEE?
AGAIN AND AGAIN,

00:14:39.034 --> 00:14:41.003
THE POWER
OF FRIENDSHIP TRIUMPHS!

00:14:41.003 --> 00:14:43.772
NOW LET THE POWER
OF YOUR BROTHERLY BOND
TRIUMPH, TOO!

00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:47.643
BE QUIET!
THE BOND I SHARED WITH
MY BROTHER IS LONG GONE!

00:14:47.643 --> 00:14:51.614
YOU'RE WRONG!
THERE ARE CERTAIN BONDS
THAT LAST FOR ETERNITY!

00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:55.584
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

00:14:55.584 --> 00:14:58.821
AND I KNOW THAT YOU DO,
TOO, GOODWIN!

00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:02.791
AFTER ALL,
YOUR BROTHER TRUSTED YOU
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:15:02.791 --> 00:15:06.228
TRUST LIKE THAT MAY
BE EASY TO IGNORE,
BUT NOT TO FORGET.

00:15:06.228 --> 00:15:09.765
GO ON, GOODWIN,
AND TAKE A LOOK DEEP
DOWN INTO YOUR HEART!

00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:11.900
I'M TELLING YOU,
ROMAN IS STILL THERE.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.103
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LISTEN TO HIM!

00:15:14.103 --> 00:15:16.639
HUH?

00:15:18.941 --> 00:15:21.176
MY BROTHER.

00:15:21.176 --> 00:15:23.879
OH, REX.

00:15:27.683 --> 00:15:30.052
WAIT! ROMAN!

00:15:34.023 --> 00:15:36.492
IS THAT...

00:15:36.492 --> 00:15:38.961
[GROANING]

00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:39.962
WHAT?

00:15:39.962 --> 00:15:41.697
OUR MARKS!

00:15:41.697 --> 00:15:43.666
THEY'RE BACK!

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:45.301
[GROANS]

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:47.703
THE MARK OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:15:47.703 --> 00:15:50.673
IT'S GIVING US POWER
LIKE NEVER BEFORE!

00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:55.177
THE MARK OF
THE DRAGON HEAD
IS WITH ME?

00:15:55.177 --> 00:15:56.845
HUH?

00:15:56.845 --> 00:15:58.814
WHAT IN THE WORLD?!

00:15:58.814 --> 00:15:59.982
NO FAIR!

00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:01.950
I WAS THE CHOSEN ONE!

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.187
I HAD THE MARKINGS OF BOTH
THE LIGHT AND THE DARKNESS!

00:16:05.187 --> 00:16:07.823
PERHAPS!
AND YET BENEATH THEM,

00:16:07.856 --> 00:16:11.293
THE CRIMSON DRAGON SAW
THAT YOU STILL HONOR
YOUR BROTHER'S MEMORY.

00:16:11.293 --> 00:16:14.196
SO NOW
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
IS A PART OF ME!

00:16:14.196 --> 00:16:15.264
All: YUSEI!

00:16:15.264 --> 00:16:17.333
YOU DID YOUR PART,
GOODWIN.

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:19.268
AND NOW, I'LL DO MINE!

00:16:19.268 --> 00:16:20.936
[ROARS]
MY TURN!

00:16:20.936 --> 00:16:22.971
FIRST, SINCE STARDUST DRAGON

00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:26.508
IS ON MY FIELD,
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
THE STARDUST XIAOLONG

00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:28.477
THAT'S SLEEPING
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:28.477 --> 00:16:30.112
[ROARS]

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.250
AND THEN I SUMMON
MAJESTIC DRAGON!

00:16:38.053 --> 00:16:39.521
NOT THAT, NO!

00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:42.491
NEXT, I TUNE LEVEL 1
MAJESTIC DRAGON

00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:44.593
WITH LEVEL 8
STARDUST DRAGON

00:16:44.593 --> 00:16:47.629
AND LEVEL 1 STARDUST
XIAOLONG!

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:51.533
[GROWL]
[ALL GASP]

00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:53.402
WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YUSEI'S DOING,

00:16:53.402 --> 00:16:55.704
HE'D BETTER DO IT QUICK!

00:16:56.972 --> 00:17:00.109
Yusei: I HARNESS ALL
THE POWER OF THE STARS.

00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:02.511
I CHANNEL ALL THE MIGHT
OF THE DRAGONS!

00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.613
I SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:17:04.613 --> 00:17:07.149
THE MAJESTIC
STAR DRAGON!

00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:09.651
[ROARS]

00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:13.422
Computer: MAJESTIC
STAR DRAGON IS A LEVEL 10
DRAGON TYPE MONSTER

00:17:13.422 --> 00:17:17.860
WITH 3,800 ATTACK POINTS
AND 3,000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:20.629
[ROARS]

00:17:20.629 --> 00:17:23.132
Yusei: AND NOW
I'LL USE HIS ABILITY!

00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:25.701
IT NEGATES THE POWER
OF YOUR IMMORTAL!

00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:29.738
WHAT?!
AND THEN I REVEAL
MY TRAP CARD,
SYNCHRO BATON!

00:17:29.738 --> 00:17:31.673
THANKS TO THIS, FOR
EVERY SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:17:31.673 --> 00:17:34.476
THAT'S IN OUR GRAVEYARDS,
I CAN INCREASE
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:17:34.476 --> 00:17:37.112
OF ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER
ON MY FIELD BY 600!

00:17:37.112 --> 00:17:40.082
SO, SINCE THERE ARE
FOUR SYNCHRO MONSTERS
IN OUR GRAVES,

00:17:40.082 --> 00:17:44.253
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON
GAINS 2,400
ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:46.021
AND HE GAINS
THE DISTINCTION OF BEING

00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:48.524
THE TOUGHEST MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:17:48.524 --> 00:17:49.958
[ROARS]

00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.660
YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS!

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.296
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
RASCA IS GOING DOWN!

00:17:54.296 --> 00:17:58.000
GO, MAJESTIC

STAR SHINE SHRED!

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.568
[GASPS]

00:17:59.568 --> 00:18:01.503
I'VE LOST. IT'S OVER.

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:03.672

00:18:47.916 --> 00:18:50.586
IS IT REALLY YOU?

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:53.055
NOT JUST ME.

00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:55.424
HELLO, BROTHER.

00:18:57.192 --> 00:18:59.228
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:18:59.228 --> 00:19:01.663
IT FEELS

00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:05.667
YOU WERE RIGHT,
YUSEI.

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:09.905
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
I WAS STILL HONORING
MY BROTHER'S MEMORY.

00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:11.340
WHERE ARE WE?

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.309
IN BETWEEN THE LIGHT
AND THE DARKNESS, YUSEI.

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:17.779
A PLACE OF PEACE,
AND IT'S ALL THANKS
TO YOU.

00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:23.018
THE BONDS WE FORM
REALLY ARE ALL
THAT MATTER IN LIFE.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.990
YUSEI,
TAKE CARE OF THEM.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.726
THEIR PLACE IS BACK
ON EARTH.

00:19:30.726 --> 00:19:33.228
NOW, IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE US,

00:19:33.228 --> 00:19:34.997
MY BROTHER ROMAN AND I

00:19:34.997 --> 00:19:38.200
HAVE SOME

00:19:44.373 --> 00:19:46.174
BUT WAIT!

00:19:55.317 --> 00:19:58.787

00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:09.097
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:20:15.304 --> 00:20:16.672
AAH!

Akiza: YEAH, AND CHECK IT OUT.

00:20:34.923 --> 00:20:37.092
EVERYTHING'S GOING
BACK TO NORMAL!

00:20:37.092 --> 00:20:38.694
AMAZING.

00:20:38.694 --> 00:20:40.996
IT'S AS THOUGH YUSEI'S
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON

00:20:40.996 --> 00:20:44.066
IS REVERSING ALL
THE DAMAGE THAT THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD DID!

00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:46.034
OH, IT'S ALL SO PRETTY!

00:20:46.034 --> 00:20:48.503
GUESS THERE'S JUST ONE
LITTLE THING THAT REMAINS.

00:20:48.503 --> 00:20:51.640
WHAT?
UH, WHERE'S THE
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.377
TAKING JACK, CROW,
AND YUSEI?

00:21:21.945 --> 00:21:22.990
Akiza:
CHECK IT OUT, GUYS.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.026
I GOT A POSTCARD IN THE MAIL
FROM MISTY THE OTHER DAY.

00:21:26.026 --> 00:21:27.961
AS USUAL,
SHE'S BUSY AS EVER.

00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:30.998
OH, AND I MEANT
TO TELL YOU, I HEARD
FROM GREIGER AND KALIN.

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:33.734
THEY SAY HI.
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
HAVING A GREAT TIME!

00:21:33.767 --> 00:21:37.037
ANYONE HEAR FROM YUSEI,
JACK, OR CROW? HUH?

00:21:37.037 --> 00:21:39.339
NO, AND I'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE FOR THEM!

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:41.341
Carly: WHAT?!

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.610
HOW CAN I WRITE MY STORY
IF THEY'RE NOT AROUND?!

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.114
ALL OF THIS SIGNER STUFF IS
MY TICKET TO A PEABODY!

00:21:47.114 --> 00:21:49.917
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
INTERVIEW YOURSELF?
YOU WERE THERE, TOO!

00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:53.554
I'LL TELL YA WHY. IT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T REMEMBER ONE SECOND
OUT OF THE WHOLE THING!

00:21:53.554 --> 00:21:56.557
SOME KIND OF MAGIC MEMORY
BRAINWASH, I GUESS!

00:21:56.557 --> 00:21:58.258
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING!

00:21:58.258 --> 00:22:02.296
HEH HEH! ON THE BRIGHT
SIDE, AT LEAST YOU HAVE
YOUR BRAIN BACK

00:22:02.296 --> 00:22:04.798
AND YOU'RE NOT
PRANCING AROUND AS
A SCARY DARK SIGNER.

00:22:04.798 --> 00:22:06.667
I WAS A DARK SIGNER?!

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:09.503
Crow:
I KNOW THE OTHERS
MUST BE WORRIED,

00:22:09.503 --> 00:22:13.006
BUT I HAVE A FEELING
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:22:13.006 --> 00:22:14.708
OH, YEAH.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:17.611
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT IT.

00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:21.648
HMM. MAKES WHAT
WE WENT THROUGH
ALL WORTH IT.

00:22:21.648 --> 00:22:23.150
SURE DOES.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.453
FINALLY, SATELLITE AND CITY
ARE ONE AND THE SAME.

00:22:26.453 --> 00:22:28.589
MAYBE ONE MAN CAN'T
BUILD A BRIDGE,

00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:30.724
BUT A TEAM
OF FRIENDS SURE CAN.

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:32.960
RIGHT, BUT OUR WORK'S
NOT DONE YET.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.963
THERE ARE PLENTY MORE BRIDGES
OUT THERE THAT NEED BUILDING.

00:22:35.963 --> 00:22:38.865
IN THAT CASE,
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

00:22:40.701 --> 00:22:42.703
LET'S REV IT UP, GUYS!

00:22:42.703 --> 00:22:44.771
AND LET'S DO IT TOGETHER!

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.418
YEAH!
