WEBVTT

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.735
Security A: OPEN UP IN THERE!

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:05.870
THIS BETTER
BE IMPORTANT.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.006
I WAS HAVING
THE BEST DREAM.

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.242
OH!

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:13.044
SECTOR SECURITY!
WE'VE GOT AUTHORIZATION

00:00:13.044 --> 00:00:15.213
TO SEARCH THESE PREMISES!

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:17.181
ANY INTERFERENCE WILL BE
CONSIDERED A CRIME.

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:19.183
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:20.218
Security B:
BACK ROOM CLEAR!

00:00:20.218 --> 00:00:21.219
WHAT'S UP?

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:22.320
Security A:
CHECKING UPSTAIRS!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.889
UH, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:26.324
HE'S IN HERE, BOYS!

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.427
JACK ATLAS, WE GOT
A WARRANT HERE FOR YOUR ARREST.

00:00:29.427 --> 00:00:31.629
YOU NEED TO COME DOWN
TO HEADQUARTERS WITH US.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:32.964
WHAT FOR!?

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:34.599
CUFF HIM, BIGGS!

00:00:34.599 --> 00:00:35.967
WHAT'S THE MEANING
OF THIS?!

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.269
Security C:
CONFISCATING
HIS DECK, SIR!

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.904
Jack: THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
I KNOW MY RIGHTS!

00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:40.905
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING!

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:41.939
GET IN THE CAR!

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:45.076
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT DID HE DO?

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:51.249

CAPTURED BY A SECURITY CAMERA

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.818
POSITIONED ON
THE GLEETMAN HIGHWAY.

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:02.720
HUH?
HUH?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.590
Crow: THAT'S JACK'S
DUEL RUNNER!

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:09.560
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.762
Trudge:
HE'S PARTICIPATING
IN A TURBO DUEL,

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.365
AND HE'S CLEARLY
TRYING TO MAKE
HIS OPPONENT CRASH.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.900
AND THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY TIME.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.870
WE'VE CAUGHT 3 OTHER
INSTANCES ON TAPE
IN THE PAST WEEK.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.273
WELL, THE...
TIMING WORKS.

00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:24.542
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "THE TIMING,"
WHAT DO YOU GUYS KNOW?

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.577
UM...

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:27.612
IT'S JUST THAT...

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:29.113
ABOUT A LITTLE MORE
THAN A WEEK AGO...

00:02:29.113 --> 00:02:33.684
WE WERE TESTING OUT SOME
NEW ENGINES AND TRAINING
FOR THE WRGP.

00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:37.355
MY LEVEL 3
DARK RESONATOR

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.558
TUNES MY LEVEL 5
BIG PIECE GOLEM.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.763
Yusei: WE WERE FOCUSING
ON TAG DUELS AND TEAM TACTICS,

00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:47.565
TRYING TO LEARN
HOW TO PLAY OFF OF ONE ANOTHER

00:02:47.565 --> 00:02:49.300
AND BUILD
ON EACH OTHER'S MOVES.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.404
Jack: AND NOW RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY!

00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:56.173
GO ABSOLUTE POWERFORCE!

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.116
HUH. I REALLY AMAZE ME!

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:06.217
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.719
WHY DID YOU SUDDENLY
GO ROGUE LIKE THAT?

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:09.820
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.422
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
JACK!

00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:13.357
HERE.
LEMME SEE YOUR HAND.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:14.425
I JUST KNEW IT!

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:16.827
YOU DREW TRUST GUARDIAN,
IT WAS READY TO GO.

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:18.563
WHEN I PLAY
MY BLACKWING,

00:03:18.563 --> 00:03:20.431
YOU BUST OUT
TRUST GUARDIAN.

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.366
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT?

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:25.002
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:29.140
I AM NOT USING SOME COWARDLY
TUNER AS SYNCHRO MATERIAL!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.374
COME ON, JACK.

00:03:30.374 --> 00:03:32.243
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO STUBBORN?

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:34.545
TRUST GUARDIAN'S POWER
CAN SAVE A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:35.980
FROM BEING DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.649
HOW IS THAT "COWARDLY,"
JACK?

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.385
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND IS
STRONG ENOUGH TO FIGHT ALONE!

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:43.921
I'M NOT HIDING IT
BEHIND SOME TUNER.

00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.423
THAT'S JUST NOT MY STYLE.

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:46.724
ARE YOU SERIOUS!?

00:03:46.724 --> 00:03:48.092
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
YOUR STUPID STYLE.

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:50.161
IT'S ABOUT
WORKING TOGETHER
WITH YOUR TEAMMATES!

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:52.763
RUBBISH! I'LL DO WHAT
I WANT N' YOU'LL LIKE IT

00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:54.031
'CAUSE YOU'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE ME!

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:55.700
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
WITHOUT ME!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.701
YOU NEED JACK ATLAS!

00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:57.935
OH, YEAH!?

00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:59.637
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CAN DO IT ALONE.

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:00.738
YOU NEED US, TOO.

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:02.006
I NEED YOU!?

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:03.741
WHO EXACTLY DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO, MATE?

00:04:03.741 --> 00:04:05.576
Yusei:
JACK, COME ON.

00:04:05.576 --> 00:04:07.578
WE'VE GOTTA THINK
LIKE A TEAM.

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:09.981
IT'S NOT ABOUT
OUR INDIVIDUAL
STYLES ANYMORE,

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.984
WE EITHER WORK TOGETHER
OR WE LOSE THE WRGP,

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:14.018
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

00:04:14.018 --> 00:04:15.920
MAYBE IT'S THAT SIMPLE
FOR YOU.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.022
BUT I AM NOT HAVING IT.

00:04:18.022 --> 00:04:19.023
SO YOU'RE LEAVING?

00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:20.191
HUH?

00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:22.493
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITHOUT US?

00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:23.995
I'LL DO WHATEVER
I WANNA DO.

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:26.097
JUST THE SAME AS
I HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

00:04:26.097 --> 00:04:28.232
NO, JACK, HEY!

00:04:28.232 --> 00:04:30.968
HE HISSY-FITS
ALL THE TIME, YUSEI.

00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:33.304
HE'LL COME TO HIS SENSES.

00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.406
Crow: WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, MAN!?

00:04:35.406 --> 00:04:37.908
WE HAVE A FIGHT, AND YOU TAKE IT
OUT ON INNOCENT RANDOMS?

00:04:37.908 --> 00:04:39.810
IT WASN'T ME,
I'M INNOCENT!

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.545
YOU DON'T SEEM INNOCENT!

00:04:41.545 --> 00:04:43.781
THAT WAS YOUR DUEL RUNNER
SLAMMING INTO THAT POOR SAP

00:04:43.781 --> 00:04:46.851
AND THAT WAS RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND TEARING THROUGH
THE SKY.

00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:49.086
HOW COULD THAT'VE POSSIBLY BEEN
SOMEONE ELSE?

00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:52.023
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
I DIDN'T DO WHAT I DIDN'T DO.

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:54.492
HUH. RIGHT.

00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:56.460
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.496
SINCE YOU'RE
A PATHETIC HAS-BEEN JERK

00:04:58.496 --> 00:05:00.064
WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING
BY HIMSELF,

00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:01.732
YOU'RE TRYING TO RUIN
OUR TEAM'S NAME!

00:05:01.732 --> 00:05:04.535
YOU'RE TRYING TO DRAG US
ALL WITH YOU TO LOSER TOWN.

00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:05.736
WHY, YOU--!!

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:07.371
WHY DON'T YOU
GET DOWN HERE, CROW,

00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:09.707
AND SAY EVERYTHING
THAT YOU JUST SAID TO MY FACE?

00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:11.075
I WOULD, BUT--
YOU'RE IN A CELL, N'--

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:12.143
CROW...

00:05:12.143 --> 00:05:13.310
I DON'T HANG OUT IN CELLS,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.345
THAT'S WHERE
SELFISH EX-CHAMPIONS

00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:15.579
WITH ATTITUDE PROBLEMS

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:16.947
WHOSE BEST DAYS ARE
WAY BEHIND THEM HANG OUT!

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:18.849
AT LEAST
I'VE BEEN A CHAMPION,

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.785
YOU'RE A NOTHING!
YOU ALWAYS WILL BE!

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:21.986
ALRIGHT, YOU...

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:23.154
IT'S QUIET TIME NOW,
LET'S GO.

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:24.955
SO LONG, JACK,
NICE KNOWIN' YA!

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:26.090
COME ON.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.258
Jack: I WISH
I COULD SAY THE SAME.

00:05:27.258 --> 00:05:29.126
Crow:
HAVE FUN NOT HAVING ANY FRIENDS!

00:05:42.403 --> 00:05:45.239
THE WORLD RACING GRAND PRIX
IS COMING SOON!

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.942
GET YOUR TICKETS NOW
OR GET LEFT IN THE DUST!

00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:49.377
WORLD RACING GRAND PRIX!

00:05:49.377 --> 00:05:52.246
THE FUTURE OF TURBO DUELING
IS NOW.

00:05:52.246 --> 00:05:53.814
THIS JUST IN.

00:05:53.814 --> 00:05:55.750
FORMER TURBO DUELING CHAMPION
JACK ATLAS

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.619
HAS BEEN ARRESTED BY SECTOR
SECURITY ON CHARGES OF ASSAULT.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.823
HE'S ACCUSED OF VIOLENTLY
ENGAGING WITH SEVERAL DUELISTS
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

00:06:02.823 --> 00:06:06.694
ACCORDING TO A STATEMENT FROM
SECTOR SECURITY, ATLAS IS
DENYING THESE CHARGES.

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:08.629
WE'LL HAVE MORE DETAILS
WHEN THEY EMERGE.

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.364
THIS IS ANGELA RAINES REPORTING.

00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:12.767
GUESS WE HAVE TO FIND
A NEW CRUSH, GIRLS.

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:14.235
SO MANY POSTERS
TO TEAR UP.

00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:16.304
AND SO LITTLE TIME.

00:06:16.304 --> 00:06:17.638
[ALL SIGH]

00:06:17.638 --> 00:06:18.906
HUH?

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:20.207
DOESN'T SHE KNOW HIM?

00:06:20.207 --> 00:06:22.877
HMM?
HMM?

00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:24.312
HOW IS THIS SURPRISING?

00:06:24.312 --> 00:06:26.714
THE GUY IS NOTHING
BUT A COCKY WASHED-UP JERK

00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:28.082
AND LET'S FACE IT...

00:06:28.082 --> 00:06:30.151
ALL WASHED-UP JERKS
EVENTUALLY CRACK.

00:06:30.151 --> 00:06:31.452
HE SAYS
HE'S INNOCENT.

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:33.554
HMM. HUH?

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:35.790
LET ME GO.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.291
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:39.894
IF JACK SAYS HE DIDN'T DO IT,
THEN HE DIDN'T DO IT.

00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:42.430
RIGHT. YOU WOULD
TAKE HIS SIDE, LEO.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.998
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:06:43.998 --> 00:06:45.900
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING!!

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.235
LEO, STOP IT!
LET HIM GO.

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.738
Editor: WHAT IS THIS DRIVEL
YOU JUST SENT ME, CARLY!?

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:53.240
I TOLD YOU TO WHIP UP
SOMETHIN' SCANDALOUS!

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.477
EVERYONE WHO KNOWS JACK
INSISTS THAT THERE'S
NO WAY HE'S GUILTY.

00:06:56.477 --> 00:06:59.580
THEY SAY THAT HE'S NICE
AND LOYAL AND HONORABLE
AND---

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.783
THE PUBLIC WANTS TO READ ABOUT
DIRT, NOT THE SUNSHINE!

00:07:02.783 --> 00:07:04.685
YOU DIG ME UP SOME DIRT
REAL QUICK-LIKE,

00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:05.786
OR YOU'RE FIRED!

00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:08.990
I CAN'T JUST
MAKE SOMETHING UP!

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.226
Akiza: SO YOU WEREN'T ABLE
TO LEARN ANYTHING ELSE?

00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:13.394
NOT REALLY.

00:07:13.394 --> 00:07:14.895
THAT'S YOUR FAULT, CROW.

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:17.231
YOU SHOULDN'T'VE GONE OFF
ON HIM LIKE YOU DID.

00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:19.367
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WAS MY BAD, I KNOW.

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:22.336
I DUNNO WHAT HAPPENED,
I JUST LOST MY TEMPER.

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:25.673
SO DO YOU THINK HE DID
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING HE DID?

00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:27.308
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY
BAD AT THIS POINT.

00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:29.010
IF THERE IS A FAKE
JACK OUT THERE,

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.579
WELL, HE HASN'T APPEARED
SINCE JACK'S ARREST.

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.214
AND JACK DOESN'T HAVE
A SINGLE ALIBI

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:36.017
FOR ANY OF THE
INCIDENTS ON VIDEO.

00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:38.052
SO UNLESS SOME NEW EVIDENCE
IS BROUGHT FORWARD,

00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:40.788
ARE THEY JUST GONNA
LOCK HIM UP AND THAT'S THAT?

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:41.956
NO WAY.

00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:43.357
BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT,
RIGHT?,

00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:45.359
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO TO PROVE THAT.

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:46.594
Yusei: LIKE WHAT?

00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:48.095
I GOT IT!

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:50.364
THERE'S CLEARLY SOMEONE OUT
THERE PRETENDING TO BE JACK.

00:07:50.364 --> 00:07:52.066
SO WE GOTTA GET OUT THERE
AND FIND HIM

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.235
AND THEN DRAG HIM TO
JUSTICE'S DOOR! HEH HEH.

00:07:54.235 --> 00:07:56.037
HOW DO WE DO THAT,
DETECTIVE?

00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:57.738
DO YOU HAVE ANY CLUES
OR LEADS, OR ANYTHING?

00:07:57.738 --> 00:07:58.739
[SIGHS]

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:00.274
LOOK GUYS,
I THINK IT'S BEST

00:08:00.274 --> 00:08:02.743
IF WE LEAVE THIS UP
TO TRUDGE FOR NOW.

00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:06.580
TRUDGE, WAIT!
YOU GOT THE
WRONG GUY.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.049
LISTEN TO ME!

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:10.785
YOU CAN'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT JACK
WOULD DO THAT STUFF.

00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:12.920
AFTER EVERYTHING HE
DID TO HELP US OUT?

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.389
HE RISKED HIS LIFE TO
TAKE DOWN SYD'S GANG

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:17.258
AFTER INTERFERING WITH
THE INVESTIGATION.

00:08:17.258 --> 00:08:19.260
THE KID'S ALL
HONOR AND HEART.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.496
I'M WITH YOU ON THIS, KAZ!
I WANNA BELIEVE, BUT...

00:08:22.496 --> 00:08:25.700
YOU SAW THE VIDEO.

00:08:29.537 --> 00:08:32.239
Jack: HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO KEEP ME LOCKED UP IN HERE?

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:35.242
HASN'T YOUR INVESTIGATION
UNCOVERED ANYTHING NEW? MINA!

00:08:35.242 --> 00:08:37.778
THE EVIDENCE IS STACKED
AGAINST YOU, JACK.

00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:40.381
THERE IS NO INVESTIGATION
ANYMORE.

00:08:40.381 --> 00:08:42.083
THE CASE IS CLOSED NOW.

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.351
ARE YOU KIDDING!?

00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:45.853
UH!

00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:48.055
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
IN THE CITY

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:50.324
SOMEONE IS PRETENDING
TO BE ME,

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:52.593
AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
FROM IN HERE.

00:08:52.593 --> 00:08:55.563
I CAN'T STAND IT.

00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:03.204
HUH?

00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:05.740
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.074
[SIREN]

00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:08.576
OH.

00:09:13.447 --> 00:09:15.549
WE HEARD THE ALARM,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:17.585
WHY IS THE DOOR OPEN?
WHERE'S JACK?

00:09:17.585 --> 00:09:18.753
[PHONE RINGS]

00:09:18.753 --> 00:09:20.254

Wedge: IT'S WEDGE,

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.557

00:09:23.557 --> 00:09:24.959

HE WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS!?

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:35.402
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
IS RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:37.304
HOW COULD SOMEBODY ELSE
HAVE THIS?

00:09:37.304 --> 00:09:39.273
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:42.243
THIS IS A RARE ONE-OF-A-KIND
MONSTER CARD.

00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:48.215
AH!
THAT'S MY DUEL RUNNER, BUT-!!

00:09:48.215 --> 00:09:50.651
[BIG MEAN LAUGH]

00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:52.353
YOU FINALLY MADE IT!

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:54.488
I WAS WORRIED YOU
DIDN'T HAVE IT IN YOU.

00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:57.525
WHAT IS THIS!?
WHO THE DEUCE ARE YOU?

00:09:57.525 --> 00:10:00.561
EVERYONE KNOWS WHO I AM!
MY NAME IS JACK ATLAS!

00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:04.131
VERY CUTE! WHY ARE YOU
RUNNING AROUND PRETENDING

DON'T BE ABSURD!

00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:12.239
IS THAT SO?

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:14.341
JACK ATLAS WOULDN'T LET
4 WALLS CONTAIN HIM.

00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:17.711
HE WOULDN'T NEED
"OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE"
TO ESCAPE, WOULD HE?

00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:22.349
HUH? ARE YOU SAYING IT WAS
YOU WHO DESTROYED THE LOCK

00:10:22.349 --> 00:10:24.485

00:12:21.635 --> 00:12:23.604
HOW COULD HE DO SOMETHING
SO DUMB!?

00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:26.607
HE'S PROBABLY HOPING TO
CATCH THE REAL CRIMINAL!

00:12:26.607 --> 00:12:29.944
IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN
WHERE WOULD HE GO?

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:31.812
AH!
HUH?

00:12:31.812 --> 00:12:35.849

00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:02.977
HE COPIES
MY MONSTERS, TOO!

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:04.144
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

00:13:04.144 --> 00:13:07.047
HURRY UP AND MAKE A MOVE.
I NEED A GOOD CHUCKLE.

00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:10.651
THAT DOES IT! YOU CAN ACT

YOU CAN'T DUEL LIKE ME!

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:15.456

I CAN SUMMON RED DRAGON

00:13:21.028 --> 00:13:23.797
BUT THIS MONSTER
JUST ISN'T MY STYLE.

00:13:23.797 --> 00:13:27.034
YOU SERIOUS!? THIS ISN'T ABOUT
YOUR STUPID STYLE.

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:29.737
THIS IS ABOUT WORKING
WITH YOUR TEAM! JERK!

00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:32.973
WE EITHER WORK TOGETHER
OR WE LOSE THE WRGP.

00:13:32.973 --> 00:13:34.908
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, JACK.

00:13:34.908 --> 00:13:36.176
I CAN'T DO IT.

00:13:36.176 --> 00:13:38.846
THIS CARD GOES AGAINST
EVERYTHING I STAND FOR.

00:13:38.846 --> 00:13:41.582
I'D RATHER LOSE
THAN USE THIS.

00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:43.917
WHEN ALL YOU'VE GOT ARE
MONSTERS ON YOUR FIELD,

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:46.286

TAKE OUT DARK RESONATOR
WITH KING STORM ATTACK!

00:14:31.598 --> 00:14:34.068
DARK RESONATOR'S ABILITY
ACTIVATES!

00:14:34.068 --> 00:14:36.236
NO NEED TO TELL ME
WHAT IT DOES!

00:14:36.236 --> 00:14:38.505
I'M FULLY AWARE THAT
DARK RESONATOR CAN AVOID

00:14:38.505 --> 00:14:40.941
BEING DESTROYED IN BATTLE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:42.543

WHAT THE REAL JACK
ATLAS IS CAPABLE OF!

00:14:47.314 --> 00:14:50.584
WHEN EXPLODER DRAGONWING
BATTLES A MONSTER WITH
FEWER ATTACK POINTS,

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:52.953
THAT MONSTER
IS DESTROYED.

00:14:52.953 --> 00:14:55.956
AND THIS IS
A SPECIAL ABILITY
DOLLING OUT THE DAMAGE,

00:14:55.956 --> 00:14:58.425
SO I'M AFRAID RESONATOR
CAN'T PROTECT ITSELF!

00:14:58.425 --> 00:15:02.129
AND NOW ALL OF
DARK RESONATOR'S
1,300 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:04.231
SLAM INTO YOU
AS DIRECT DAMAGE!

00:15:06.967 --> 00:15:10.170
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.306
PATHETIC.

00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:15.576
IS THIS A JOKE?

00:15:15.576 --> 00:15:18.579
ARE YOU TRYING TO MOCK ME
WITH THIS PALTRY EFFORT?

00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:21.248
NOBODY INSULTS ME!

00:15:21.248 --> 00:15:25.419
I BUSTED YOU OUT
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY CHALLENGE ME.

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:29.189
BUT YOU'RE DUELING LIKE
A SECOND-RATE CLOWN
HOPING TO GET A LAUGH.

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:31.325
YOU AREN'T WORTHY OF
DUELING THE CHAMPION.

00:15:31.325 --> 00:15:33.227
YOUR VERY PRESENCE
IS AN INSULT.

00:15:33.227 --> 00:15:37.965
AND NO ONE, NO ONE
INSULTS THE GREAT JACK ATLAS!!

00:15:37.965 --> 00:15:40.334
WHAT'S THIS
WEIRD FEELING?

00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:44.571
IS THIS...IS THIS
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE
AFRAID OF SOMETHING?

00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:46.673
WHY AM I AFRAID?

00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.479
YUSEI, HEADS UP!

00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:54.148
CHECK OUT THE SIGNS!

00:15:54.148 --> 00:15:55.983
SOMEONE'S DUELING UP AHEAD.

00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:58.852
WELL, DO YOU THINK
IT'S JACK?

00:16:03.857 --> 00:16:06.026

THAT I'M THE REAL
JACK ATLAS!

00:16:10.264 --> 00:16:13.400

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.672
JUST WATCH! FIRST, I ACTIVATE

00:16:18.672 --> 00:16:19.907

00:16:19.907 --> 00:16:22.142
YOUR SAD LITTLE ATTEMPT
TO WHITTLE AWAY AT MY POWER

00:16:22.142 --> 00:16:26.246
HELPED ME SATISFY
THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED
TO ACTIVATE THIS TRAP!

00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:28.148
WHEN I HAVE FEWER
LIFE POINTS THAN YOU,

00:16:28.148 --> 00:16:30.884
I CAN SEND OUT SHOCKWAVE
AND DESTROY ONE MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:34.321
AND THEN WE'LL BOTH TAKE DAMAGE
EQUAL TO ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:38.292
SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR EXPLODER DRAGONWING!

00:16:45.766 --> 00:16:47.668
WHY DID THAT HURT?

00:16:47.668 --> 00:16:50.470
HOW'S IT POSSIBLE
THAT I FELT THAT?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.239
HA HA!

00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:53.740
THIS IS HOW A CHAMP
DOES THINGS!

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.010
THIS DUEL ISN'T JUST ABOUT
OUR LIFE POINTS, IS IT?

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.547
NO, NO, LITTLE CLOWN.
THIS DUEL IS ABOUT OUR LIVES!

00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:02.015
WHA--!? YOU--!!

00:17:02.015 --> 00:17:03.350
WHY'RE YOU ACTING
LIKE YOU'RE WINNING?

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.552
YOU JUST LOST
LIFE POINTS THE SAME
AS I DID!

00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:08.455
HMPH! IF I WERE TO GO
AT YOU FULL FORCE,

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:10.190
YOU WOULD BE FINISHED
IN AN INSTANT.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.259
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
FINISH YOU JUST YET.

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:14.928
I INTEND TO PLAY
A LITTLE CAT AND MOUSE.

00:17:14.928 --> 00:17:17.598
I NOW SUMMON
MAD ARCHFIEND!

00:17:21.168 --> 00:17:24.238
MAD ARCHFIEND HAS
1,800 ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:24.238 --> 00:17:26.974
IF IT ATTACKS
SUCCESSFULLY,
I'M FINISHED.

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:28.942
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:17:28.942 --> 00:17:32.079
I REVEAL THE POWERFUL
REBIRTH TRAP CARD!

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:35.249
THIS TRAP ENABLES ME TO
SUMMON A WEAKER MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:35.249 --> 00:17:38.385
AND THEN EQUIP THE
MONSTER I SUMMON WITH
THE POWER OF THIS CARD.

00:17:38.385 --> 00:17:43.190
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,
I SUMMON DREAD DRAGON
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.659
AND NOW, BY EQUIPPING
POWERFUL REBIRTH,

00:17:45.659 --> 00:17:50.097
IT GAINS 100 DEFENSE
POINTS AND ONE LEVEL!

00:17:50.097 --> 00:17:51.531
EVEN IF I TAKE
PIERCING DAMAGE

00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:53.934
FROM MAD ARCHFIEND'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:56.403
I'LL HAVE 300
LIFE POINTS REMAINING.

00:17:56.403 --> 00:17:58.572
I REVEAL THE POWERFUL
REBIRTH TRAP CARD!

00:17:58.572 --> 00:18:01.908
YOU WHAT!? THAT WAS
YOUR FACEDOWN CARD, TOO?

00:18:01.908 --> 00:18:05.579
AND I SUMMON DARK RESONATOR
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:07.547
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK
I WOULD ATTACK YOU

00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:10.017
WITH MAD ARCHFIEND
WITHOUT POWERING IT UP?

00:18:10.017 --> 00:18:11.184
WHAT A LAUGH!

00:18:11.184 --> 00:18:13.353
A CHAMPION DOESN'T BOTHER
TRYING TO CHIP AWAY,

00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:15.922
A CHAMPION GOES FULL FORCE!

00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:18.625
REMEMBER, I'M
THE MASTER OF FASTER.

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.360
I RULE THE DUEL!

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.962
AH.

00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:24.865
THIS CHAMPION
IS GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:18:24.865 --> 00:18:28.068
MAD ARCHFIEND GETS
A TUNING FROM DARK
RESONATOR,

00:18:28.068 --> 00:18:30.971
WHICH IS ALSO
A LEVEL 4 NOW.

00:18:30.971 --> 00:18:32.105
A LEVEL 8...

00:18:32.105 --> 00:18:34.207
IT..IT CAN'T BE...!

00:18:42.749 --> 00:18:47.287
I SYNCHRO SUMMON--
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:53.427
THIS ISN'T POSSIBLE.

00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:56.163
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
IS A ONE-OF-A-KIND
MONSTER.

00:18:56.163 --> 00:18:58.598
AND IT'S ONLY
IN MY DECK!

00:19:18.751 --> 00:19:23.923
GO, RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND,
TEAR UP THAT DREAD DRAGON!

00:19:27.126 --> 00:19:29.028
WITH IT GONE,
I REVEAL MY TRAP!

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:30.696
LINEAGE OF DESTRUCTION!

00:19:30.696 --> 00:19:31.964
NO!

00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:35.034
SINCE I DESTROYED A MONSTER
OF YOURS IN DEFENSE MODE...

00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:37.670
LINEAGE OF DESTRUCTION CAN
ENABLE RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.239
TO ATTACK FOR A SECOND TIME!

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:42.541
AND I'M AFRAID THAT
THIS TIME AROUND

00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:45.845
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND WILL BE
ATTACKING YOU DIRECTLY!

00:19:47.947 --> 00:19:49.682
NO WAY!

00:19:49.682 --> 00:19:52.418
UH! AAH!

00:19:56.088 --> 00:19:58.290
HOW? HOW COULD HE
HAVE MY CARDS?

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.427
AND HOW COULD HE'VE
MASTERED RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND'S TACTICS?

00:20:01.427 --> 00:20:03.162
WHO IS HE?

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.332
WHEN AN ENGINE BURNS OUT,

00:20:06.332 --> 00:20:08.868
YOU REPLACE IT WITH
A BETTER ONE, AN UPGRADE.

00:20:08.868 --> 00:20:12.872
AND YOU, MY LITTLE CLOWN,
HAVE DEFINITELY BURNED OUT.

00:20:12.872 --> 00:20:15.841
SO I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
YOUR UPGRADE!

00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:17.443
AH!

00:20:30.222 --> 00:20:32.358
JACK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:20:32.358 --> 00:20:34.660
RUNNING ONLY MAKES YOU
LOOK GUILTY?

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.095
HEH HEH.

00:20:39.265 --> 00:20:40.933
[SCREAMING]

00:20:42.968 --> 00:20:45.037
HUH?

00:20:46.906 --> 00:20:48.674
HE'S GONE.
