WEBVTT

00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:03.074
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D'S"

00:00:03.074 --> 00:00:05.810
Jack: WELCOME
TO THE KAIBA DOME!

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.944
LET'S RIDE.
LET'S RIDE.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:10.281
JUNK WARRIOR SEND'EM
TO THE SCRAP HEAP!

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.917
ERR!

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:14.419
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.056
FEEL THE POWER OF MY
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.924
[ROARING]

00:00:23.494 --> 00:00:25.797
YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET
EVER COMING HERE, YUSEI,

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:29.667
'CAUSE I'M GOING TO BEAT
YOU WITH YOUR OWN CARD!

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:30.868
WHAT IS THAT?

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.040
I'LL TEACH YOU TO
PLAY TRICKS WITH ME!

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.009
I ACTIVATE
A SPEED SPELL!

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.811
END OF STORM!

00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.546
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WE GOTTA STOP!

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.253
[THINKING]
THE MIGHTY BEAST HAS
EMERGED FROM ITS SLUMBER

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:57.428
WHERE DID THIS
COME FROM?

00:00:57.428 --> 00:01:00.498
JACK, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:01.632
UNH!

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:03.835
YOU ARE IN VIOLATION
OF CODE 36-B,

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.303
WE ARE PLACING YOU
UNDER ARREST.

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:06.671
DO NOT TRY TO RUN.

00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.306
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:10.208
[THINKING]
OH, MAN, I GOT
NO ESCAPE,

00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:12.443
BUT EVEN IF I DID MANAGE
TO GET AWAY,

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:13.444
I STILL DON'T
KNOW WHAT THAT

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.079

Judge: WHO'S NEXT?

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.343
"YUSEI FUDO?"

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:21.579
LOOK AT HIM...
HE'S A BOY!

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.182
WHAT'S SO BAD
ABOUT THIS KID?

00:02:24.182 --> 00:02:26.250
LET'S CHECK OUT
THE COMPLAINT.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.187
MR. YUSEI FUDO,
TURBO DUELING

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:30.454
WITHOUT A LICENSE,

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:33.191
BLAH BLAH,
MALICIOUS MISCHIEF

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.892
BLAWDY BLAH BLAH...

00:02:34.892 --> 00:02:38.095
ENTERING THE LIMITS
OF NEW DOMINO CITY
WITHOUT A PERMIT?

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:39.664
HMM.

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:42.500
WELL NOW, WE CAN'T
HAVE THAT, CAN WE?

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:45.970
SO HERE'S A LITTLE
TRACKING DYE.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.405
IS IT SUPPOSED
TO TICKLE?

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:50.975
IT'S SUPPOSED TO MAKE
SURE WE CAN KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU!

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:54.478
NOW TO DISCUSS
PUNISHMENT.

00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:57.448
AWWWWW!

00:02:57.448 --> 00:02:59.584
Judge, voice-over:
I BELIEVE A FEW MONTHS
IN THE "THE FACILITY"

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:00.751
SHOULD DO IT.

00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:02.119
ALL ABOARD!

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.187
NOT TO WORRY,
YOUNG MAN.

00:03:03.187 --> 00:03:05.623
THINK OF IT AS
A SORT OF SUMMER CAMP.

00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:08.059
LOTS OF TIME TO YOURSELF,
ARTS CRAFTS,

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.360
COLORFUL CHARACTERS.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.461
HI!

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.129
AFTER YOUR SENTENCE... AHEM...

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.032
I MEAN, "VACATION" IS OVER,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO

00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:18.402
BACK TO SATELLITE,
AS LONG AS YOU NEVER DUEL

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:21.172
OR SET FOOT
IN NEW DOMINO CITY AGAIN.

00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:22.740
HEY, KID!

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.375
HUH? HMM.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.943
HOW YA DOIN'?

00:03:25.943 --> 00:03:27.812
I'M SURE YA HEARD
OF ME, YOUNG FELLA.

00:03:27.812 --> 00:03:29.347
NAME'S YANAGI!

00:03:29.347 --> 00:03:32.283
ADVENTURE'S MY NAME,
AND FAMOUS RELICS
ARE MY GAME!

00:03:32.283 --> 00:03:34.986
PUT 'ER THERE!

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.854
GUESS YOU'RE NOT
INTO SHAKING HANDS.

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:38.356
WELL, THAT'S ALRIGHT!

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:41.492
WAAAIT A SECOND,
I NEVER FORGET A FACE!

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:43.094
YOU WERE
AT THE KAIBA DOME!

00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:46.163
I SAW SECTOR SECURITY
TAKE YOU AWAY!

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:49.734
SO WAS IT YOU WHO
MADE ALL THE POWER
IN THE CITY GO OUT?

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:51.335
AND THAT MONSTER.

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:54.372
DID YOU CAUSE THAT
RED DRAGON TO APPEAR,
AS WELL?!

00:03:57.575 --> 00:04:02.213
'CAUSE IF YA DID,
NOT BAD!

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:04.982
I MEAN THAT WAS WAS
THE MOST AMAZING THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:06.017
YOU SAW THAT?

00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:07.218
DID I SEE IT?

00:04:07.218 --> 00:04:09.754
THE WHOLE CITY
SAW THAT DRAGON!

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:11.188
PLEASE TELL ME
WHERE YOU GOT IT!

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:12.423
EAST INDIA?

00:04:12.423 --> 00:04:13.491
THE SOUTH AMERICAN
PYRAMIDS?

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:15.059
LOST CAVES?

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.060
HUH?

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:23.868
AAH!

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:29.940
AAH!

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.211
AH. MY ARM WHY DOES IT
HURT SO MUCH?

00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:36.914
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:04:36.914 --> 00:04:40.284
MINA? WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME LAST NIGHT?

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:41.919
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN, MR. ATLAS?

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.788
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

00:04:43.788 --> 00:04:45.489
YOU WERE
IN THE KAIBA DOME.

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:48.092
YOU HAD A DUEL
WITH A SATELLITE
NAMED "YUSEI".

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:50.094
IT WAS AMAZING!
YOU HAD HIM
ON THE ROPES,

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:51.095
AND THEN HE
COUNTERED,

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:52.263
AND YOU COUNTERED,

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:53.331
AND THEN
THE POWER OUTAGE

00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:54.365
SAVED YOU
FROM LOSING.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:55.633
SAVED ME FROM WHAT?!

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:56.867
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I HAD HIM RIGHT

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.202
WHERE I WANTED HIM!

00:04:58.202 --> 00:05:00.638
OH, UM,
OF COURSE YOU DID!

00:05:00.638 --> 00:05:02.206
PLEASE DON'T BE
ANGRY MR. ATLAS.

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:04.141
RIGHT!

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.377
WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU
HEADING OFF TO?

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:08.846
MR. GOODWIN TOLD
ME YOU SHOULD BE
RESTING!

00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:12.817
Zigzix: YOU SEE, WHEN JACK
AND YUSEI'S DRAGONS ATTACKED

00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:14.585
EACH OTHER,
THERE WAS A HUGE BURST

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.387
OF THE "ULTIMATE ENERGY"
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:18.022
I CALL IT ENER-D!

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:19.390
GET IT? IT RHYMES
WITH "ENERGY,"

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.591
AND THE "D" IS
FOR DUELING,

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:23.594
SO YOU GET,
THE, UM, THE IDEA. HEH.

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:25.463
WHATEVER WE CALL IT
ZIGZIX,

00:05:25.463 --> 00:05:28.132
THIS POWER FLUX WAS
APPARENTLY STRONG
ENOUGH TO AWAKEN

00:05:28.132 --> 00:05:29.800
THE ANCIENT
AND MYSTICAL POWERS

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.702
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:34.271
THE CRIMSON DRAGON?!

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:35.773
BUT ITS ENERGY
IS IMMEASURABLE.

00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:37.341
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:38.909
SHOULD ALL OF ITS POWERS
BE UNLEASHED!

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.946
EARTHQUAKES! TORNADOES!
CATACLYSMIC CATASTROPHES!

00:05:41.946 --> 00:05:44.615
COMPLETE GENERATOR MELTDOWN!

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:47.051
WE LOST THE SIGNAL
RIGHT HERE.

00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.687
THE DRAGON OVERLOADED
THE POWER GRID.

00:05:49.687 --> 00:05:50.955
EXCELLENT.

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.289
SO IT SEEMS
THE POWER CREATED

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.959
BY ITS SUMMONING IS
GREATER THAN WE
EVER IMAGINED.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.960
HEH HEH HEH.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.961
HMM.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.121
Man: WELCOME
TO THE FACILITY,

00:06:13.121 --> 00:06:14.723
YOUR "HOME AWAY FROM HOME!"

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:16.458
A WARM BED,
THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY,

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:20.628
EVERYTHING THE PUBLIC
MISCREANT COULD WANT!

00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:21.796
HURRY UP!

00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:27.902
Computer: IDENTIFICATION
NUMBER G2MA2-88.

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:30.772
ILLEGAL ENTRY
TO NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:34.142
BET YOU WISH YOU STAYED
IN THE SATELLITE NOW!

00:06:34.142 --> 00:06:36.311
NOW LISTEN UP...
THE RULES ARE SIMPLE:

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:38.213
NO CHEWING GUM,
NO FIGHTING,

00:06:38.213 --> 00:06:39.781
AND NO DUELING!

00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:42.150
ALSO, YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.585
TO THESE BARS.

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.887
SOME OF THESE GUYS BITE!

00:06:48.556 --> 00:06:51.693
NOW AS LONG AS YOU STAY QUIET
AND FOLLOW THOSE DIRECTIONS,

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:54.062
YOU SHOULD BE SAFE.

00:06:54.062 --> 00:06:56.397
ALRIGHT!
HERE ARE YOUR NEW ROOMS.

00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:58.933
I HOPE THE WATER STAINED
BATTLESHIP GREY IS

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:00.368
TO YOUR LIKING.

00:07:00.368 --> 00:07:03.571
HOME SWEET HOME!!!

00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:06.674
YANAGI'S BEEN HERE
A FEW TIMES BEFORE
AS YOU CAN TELL.

00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:09.711
PERSONALLY I THINK
THE FOOD'S FINALLY
GOTTEN TO HIM!

00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:12.514
HEY! GUARD!

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:13.815
WHAT D'YA WANT?

00:07:13.815 --> 00:07:15.950
THOUGHT I'D
THROW A LITTLE
"WELCOME PARTY"

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.452
FOR MY NEW
NEIGHBORS.

00:07:17.452 --> 00:07:19.220
YOU KNOW, TEACH 'EM
THE ROPES,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.189
MAKE SURE THEY STAY
IN LINE.

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:22.891
GOOD LUCK.

00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:24.793
NEW GUY LOOKS
LIKE TROUBLE.

00:07:26.895 --> 00:07:28.663
HEH HEH HEH!

00:07:28.663 --> 00:07:31.332
AHHHH!
GREAT TO BE BACK!

00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:34.936
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO
MUCH NICER THAN MY
LAST ROOMMATE?

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:37.572
WHAT'S A GUY LIKE
YOU DOING HERE?

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:39.707
ME? I COLLECT CARDS!

00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:41.276
EVERYONE DOES THAT!

00:07:41.276 --> 00:07:42.977
NOT QUITE!

00:07:42.977 --> 00:07:45.480
SEE MINE ARE ILLEGAL
MAGIC RELICS!

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.216
THEY'RE FROM ANCIENT
CIVILIZATIONS!

00:07:48.216 --> 00:07:49.818
THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY COOL.

00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:51.486
WISH I COULD SEE SOME.

00:07:51.486 --> 00:07:54.923
TA-DAH! LOOK HERE!
AND HERE!

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:56.157
LIKE I SAID!

00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:57.759
I'VE BEEN STUCK HERE
SO MANY TIMES,

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.960
I'VE LEARNED HOW
TO SNEAK IN

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.728
MY ENTIRE DECK
PAST THE GUARDS!

00:08:00.728 --> 00:08:02.363
AND IT'S A GOOD
THING I DID!

00:08:02.363 --> 00:08:04.399
WHY? WE CAN'T DUEL!

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.367
YOU GOT A LOT
TO LEARN, SONNY!

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:08.303
DUELING IS THE ONLY
WAY TO STAY SAFE!

00:08:08.303 --> 00:08:10.405
AND YOU'LL LEARN THAT
LESSON SOON ENOUGH!

00:08:10.405 --> 00:08:14.008
BUT AS LONG AS WE GOT
THESE CARDS, WE'RE SET!

00:08:14.008 --> 00:08:16.477
OKAY.
HA HA HA!

00:08:16.477 --> 00:08:18.813
WAIT! THE DIRECTOR'S
IN A MEETING!

00:08:18.813 --> 00:08:21.549
HE CAN'T
BE DISTURBED!

00:08:21.549 --> 00:08:23.351
LOOK AT THIS!

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:24.652
THE ENER-D INCREASED

00:08:24.652 --> 00:08:26.321
WHEN BOTH DRAGONS
WERE OUT!

00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:28.523
BUT IT ONLY WENT INTO
TO OVERDRIVE WHEN THEY

00:08:28.523 --> 00:08:30.391
ATTACKED EACH OTHER!

00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:32.393
VERY INTERESTING.

00:08:32.393 --> 00:08:34.963
WE MUST FIND OUT WHY
THESE TWO BEASTS

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.699
WERE ABLE TO AWAKEN
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:08:37.699 --> 00:08:38.700
HMM.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.635
[DOOR OPENS]

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:43.671
I'M SORRY, DIRECTOR.

00:08:43.671 --> 00:08:45.807
JACK.

00:08:45.807 --> 00:08:47.442
THAT'S MY DUEL!

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:50.511
DID THESE TWO PEONS
RECORD WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?!

00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:52.413
CALM DOWN, JACK.

00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:55.383
YOU BROKE A DOZEN
LAWS LAST NIGHT.

00:08:55.383 --> 00:08:56.751
YOU'RE LUCKY THAT
YOUR LITTLE MATCH

00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:58.319
DIDN'T END UP
ON THE NEWS!

00:08:58.319 --> 00:09:00.521
IT'S OUR JOB
TO PROTECT YOU, JACK,

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:02.357
SO WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:05.360
SO THEN PLEASE HELP
ALL OF US HELP YOU.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.029
TELL US ABOUT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:09.931
SURE, LIKE WHAT,
GOODWIN?!

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.932
I KNOW!

00:09:10.932 --> 00:09:13.134
HOW'BOUT THIS?

00:09:13.134 --> 00:09:15.336
THIS STARTED TO BURN!

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:16.971
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:18.773
IT'S THE CRIMSON
DRAGON'S MARK.

00:09:18.773 --> 00:09:20.608
IT'S A SYMBOL
OF POWER.

00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:21.776
YOU ARE ONE
OF THE RARE FEW

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:24.245
KNOWN AS A SIGNER.

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:25.680
SO WHAT?

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.282
THIS SIGN INDICATES
THAT YOU ARE

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.684
DESTINED
FOR GREAT THINGS.

00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:33.121
YEAH?! WELL I ALREADY
KNEW I WAS DESTINED
FOR GREATNESS!

00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:36.157
SO TELL ME, WHY DID
YUSEI HAVE ONE, AS WELL?!

00:09:36.157 --> 00:09:37.358
WHAT WAS THAT?!

00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:39.627
THAT SATELLITE HAD
THE SIGN AS WELL?!

00:09:39.627 --> 00:09:41.429
DIDN'T YOUR
CAMERAS PICK IT UP?

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:43.898
JACK, SIGNS MEAN FAR
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

00:09:43.898 --> 00:09:46.567
YOU HAVE TO BE SURE
THAT YUSEI HAD ONE.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:48.736
SO WHAT IF HE HAD ONE!

00:09:48.736 --> 00:09:50.505
YUSEI'S NOT DESTINED
FOR ANYTHING

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:52.807
BUT MINIMUM WAGE!

00:09:52.807 --> 00:09:54.742
PLUS, HE DIDN'T HAVE
ONE IN THE SATELLITE,

00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:57.378
SO IT MUST BE A FAKE.

00:09:57.378 --> 00:09:58.813
HUH? WHAT WAS THAT
ON THE VIDEO?!

00:09:58.813 --> 00:10:00.381
PLAY IT BACK TO ME!

00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:02.717
BEFORE THIS!

00:10:02.717 --> 00:10:04.786
THERE! COME ON. COME ON!

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:07.588
I WANT THAT
IMAGE ENLARGED.

00:10:07.588 --> 00:10:11.259
UH-OF COURSE!

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:13.995
OH! THAT CARD!

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:16.564
THAT'S... THAT'S
METEOR STREAM!

00:10:16.564 --> 00:10:18.633
YOU ARE CORRECT
AS USUAL.

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:20.802
AND YOU SHOULD BE
PLEASED THAT
THE POWER WENT OUT.

00:10:20.835 --> 00:10:22.437
OTHERWISE,
YOUR UNBEATEN STREAK

00:10:22.437 --> 00:10:24.138
WOULD HAVE
COME TO AN END.

00:10:24.138 --> 00:10:25.139
IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME,

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:26.441
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:28.609
I ACTIVATE
A SPEED SPELL!

00:10:28.609 --> 00:10:30.445
END OF STORM!

00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:32.347
DON'T LOOK SO
DEPRESSED, JACK!

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:35.350
I GUESS YOUR FRIEND
YUSEI LEARNED SOME
NEW TRICKS!

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.151
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
YOUR COMBO WOULD

00:10:37.151 --> 00:10:39.620
GIVE YOU BACK STARDUST,
BUT YOU OPENED THE DOOR

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.822
FOR A COUNTERATTACK.

00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:43.224
IT'S AN EASY MISTAKE.

00:10:43.224 --> 00:10:44.525
A MISTAKE?!

00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:46.361
YOU HAD BETTER WATCH
WHAT YOU SAY IN FRONT OF ME,

00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:48.496
YOU MISERABLE
PURPLE-HAIRED
LITTLE FREAK!

00:10:48.496 --> 00:10:50.598
I ONLY SPEAK
THE TRUTH.

00:10:50.598 --> 00:10:52.700
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING
ALL ALONG!

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.268
HOW MANY TIMES
MUST I TELL YOU

00:10:54.268 --> 00:10:56.604
YUSEI'S JUST A LOSER?!

00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:58.272
I'M THE CHAMP,
AND I'M THE ONE WHO'S

00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:01.376
GONE UNDEFEATED
IN NEW DOMINO CITY!

00:11:01.376 --> 00:11:03.044
THEN WHY DOESN'T
OUR DEAR CHAMPION

00:11:03.044 --> 00:11:04.612
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YUSEI'S

00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:08.182
METEOR STREAM
COUNTERS YOUR
INTENDED MOVE?

00:11:08.182 --> 00:11:10.284
YOU LOSE THE MATCH!

00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:13.421
BUT I STILL HAD 900
LIFE POINTS AFTER MY COMBO,

00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:17.191
AND HIS METEOR STREAM
WAS ONLY GONNA TAKE AWAY...

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:21.095
ALL OF THEM.

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:23.464
THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO.

00:11:23.464 --> 00:11:27.068
I ACTUALLY LOST TO HIM.
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:11:27.068 --> 00:11:29.303
ERR!

00:11:29.303 --> 00:11:31.706
JACK! LAST NIGHT
NEVER HAPPENED.

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:34.575
NO ONE OUTSIDE
THIS ROOM KNOWS
THIS VIDEO EXISTS.

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:36.144
BUT I KNOW, GOODWIN!

00:11:36.144 --> 00:11:37.945
I KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT!

00:11:37.945 --> 00:11:40.181
AND I'M GOING
TO SETTLE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS!

00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:41.816
WHERE IS YUSEI?!

00:11:41.849 --> 00:11:43.885
I HAVE TO DUEL
HIM AGAIN!

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.256
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
A LITTLE TRICKY
RIGHT NOW.

00:11:48.256 --> 00:11:49.824
YUSEI'S A SATELLITE.

00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:52.560
THEREFORE HE'S
BEEN TAKEN TO
THE FACILITY.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.028
AND I'M AFRAID HE
WON'T BE LEAVING

00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:55.797
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

00:11:55.797 --> 00:11:57.265
BUT DON'T WORRY,
JACK.

00:11:57.265 --> 00:12:01.803
WE HEAR THAT
HE'S BEING MADE
FEEL RIGHT AT HOME

00:12:01.803 --> 00:12:03.604
I'M GOING.

00:12:03.604 --> 00:12:05.273
THE FACILITY?!

00:12:05.273 --> 00:12:06.507
IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF A JOKE,

00:12:06.507 --> 00:12:08.109
I'M NOT LAUGHING,
JACK.

00:12:08.109 --> 00:12:10.411
DON'T THROW AWAY ALL
THAT WE'VE WORKED FOR

00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:12.013
JUST TO PROVE THAT
YOU'RE THE BEST
AGAINST HIM.

00:12:12.013 --> 00:12:14.782
YOUR SIGN, JACK,
IT IS YOUR DESTINY!

00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:20.988
[WHIMPERING]

00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:24.425
SAY HELLO, NEWBIE,
TO MY DUEL STADIUM.

00:12:26.594 --> 00:12:28.496

READY?

00:12:51.445 --> 00:12:52.880
YOU READY, GUYS?

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.382
LET'S SEE WHAT
HE'S MADE OF.

00:12:55.382 --> 00:12:56.984
AAH! AAH!

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:59.286
NOW LEMME TELL YA HOW
THINGS ARE GONNA WORK
AROUND HERE.

00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:01.388
FIRST DAY IN,
EVERYONE DUELS.

00:13:01.388 --> 00:13:03.457
YOU DUEL GOOD,
YOU GET RESPECT.

00:13:03.457 --> 00:13:05.692
BUT DON'T GET
NO IDEAS

00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:07.361
'CAUSE I'M THE BEST.

00:13:07.361 --> 00:13:10.564
AHHH! HA HA HA!

00:13:10.564 --> 00:13:11.899

YOU'RE BOLT TANNER!

00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:14.468
HE'S A PRO!

00:13:14.468 --> 00:13:16.036
AND I'M YOUR
BIGGEST FAN!

00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:18.005
CAN I HAVE
AN AUTOGRAPH PLEASE!

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:20.374
SURE, BUT I ONLY WRITE
IN BLACK AND BLUE?

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:21.742
AW, MAN.

00:13:21.742 --> 00:13:23.610
THE OLD GUY HAD
THAT COMING!

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.078
TANNER SURE DOES HATE IT
WHEN ANYBODY

00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:26.647
BRINGS UP HIS PAST!

00:13:26.647 --> 00:13:27.981
CONGRATS!

00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:29.416
YOU GOT YOUR
FIRST OPPONENT,

00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:30.951
AND IT'S YOURS TRULY!

00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.052
AND I'M GONNA MOP THE FLOOR

00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:33.821
WITH THAT BIG HEAD
OF YOURS!

00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:35.289
AND CAUSE YA GOT
NO DECK, LOOKS LIKE

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:38.091
YOU'RE DUELIN' WITH
A REJECT ONE WE PUT TOGETHER.

00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:39.326
HEE HEE!

00:13:39.326 --> 00:13:42.162
ACTUALLY I SMUGGLED
IN MY OWN DECK, TANNER!

00:13:42.162 --> 00:13:44.031
AND IT'S THE GREATEST
DECK EVER MADE!

00:13:44.031 --> 00:13:45.232
EHHH!

00:13:45.232 --> 00:13:47.401
AND I CALL IT MY
TREASURE DECK!

00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:48.602
AND IT'S PACKED!

00:13:48.602 --> 00:13:52.406
RELICS! FOSSILS!
ANTIQUES!

00:13:52.406 --> 00:13:53.874
SEE? SEE?

00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:55.275
IT'S ALL HERE!

00:13:55.275 --> 00:13:56.410
A "TREASURE DECK?!"

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.246
HOW'D HE GET THAT?!

00:13:59.246 --> 00:14:01.415
EITHER WAY, THEY WON'T
HELP YOU, GRANDPA.

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:03.383
N'WHERE'S YOUR DECK?

00:14:03.383 --> 00:14:05.953
NOT WITH ME.

00:14:05.953 --> 00:14:07.754
AFTER I'M THROUGH
WITH GRAMPS OVER HERE,

00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:09.656
I'LL RUSTLE UP SOME
CARDS FOR YOU.

00:14:09.656 --> 00:14:11.124
AND THEN I'LL TEACH
YOU A THING OR TWO

00:14:11.158 --> 00:14:12.993
ABOUT DUELING
IN THE FACILITY.

00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:14.628
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE
IT'LL BE A LESSON

00:14:14.628 --> 00:14:16.997
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:18.232
OOOOOOKAY!

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.067
LET'S EVERYONE
CALM DOWN!

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:21.902
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE,
AND I KNOW HOW THE RULES

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:23.303
ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK!

00:14:23.303 --> 00:14:25.906
IF I WIN, THEN
WELL I'M IN CHARGE.

00:14:25.906 --> 00:14:28.041
LIKE THAT WOULD
EVER HAPPEN!

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:29.943
WELL SINCE YOU'RE
SO CONFIDENT,

00:14:29.943 --> 00:14:31.111
LET'S GET
THIS DUEL STARTED

00:14:31.111 --> 00:14:32.513
SO I CAN END IT.

00:14:32.513 --> 00:14:34.314
WHOO-HOO!

00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:36.450
THIS IS LIKE A DREAM
COME TRUE, TANNER!

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.985
DUELING MY HERO!

00:14:37.985 --> 00:14:38.986
JUST GO!

00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:40.354
BE CAREFUL, TANNER!

00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:41.889
AFTER ALL IF HIS DECK'S
FOR REAL,

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:44.491
THEN YOU JUST MIGHT HAVE
A FIGHT ON YOUR HANDS!

00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:46.360
LIKE HIS "TREASURE DECK"
IS REAL.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.061
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH!

00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:50.564
OH THEY'RE REAL!
I PROMISE!

00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:53.400
AND THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE!

00:14:54.668 --> 00:14:57.604
GRANDPA!
AGE BEFORE BEAUTY!

00:14:57.604 --> 00:15:00.407
HA HA HA! I GET IT!

00:15:00.407 --> 00:15:01.875
I'M FIRST!

00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:07.014
HA HA HA!

00:15:07.014 --> 00:15:08.615
WATCH THIS!

00:15:08.615 --> 00:15:09.716
OH!

00:15:09.716 --> 00:15:11.218
A PRICELESS ARTIFACT!

00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:14.521
I GOT THIS ONE DURING MY
LAST AMAZING ADVENTURE!

00:15:14.521 --> 00:15:17.257
I BEFRIENDED
AN ANCIENT TRIBE
OF AZTEC WARRIORS,

00:15:17.257 --> 00:15:19.660
WHO LED ME
TO THEIR SECRET,
FORBIDDEN TEMPLE,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.761
WHERE I FOUND...

00:15:20.761 --> 00:15:22.896
SAVE THE STORIES
FOR BEDTIME, GRANDPA,

00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:24.031
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:25.599
WHERE I FOUND THIS!

00:15:25.599 --> 00:15:30.237
THE ANCIENT RELIC KNOWN
AS THE CRYSTAL SKULL.

00:15:30.237 --> 00:15:32.205
Computer: CRYSTAL SKULL
IS A MONSTER CARD

00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:34.174
THAT DEALS 1000 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:15:34.174 --> 00:15:36.710
TO ITS CONTROLLER
WHEN IT IS SUMMONED.

00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:42.649
HA HA HA!

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:46.687
SO WHO'S LAUGHING
NOW, TANNER?!

00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:49.556
HUH? AAH!

00:15:49.556 --> 00:15:51.858
YOU DIDN'T READ
THE FINE PRINT,
GRAMPS!

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:54.795
LOOKS LIKE HIS TREASURE
HAS ITS OWN CURSE!

00:15:54.795 --> 00:15:57.097
HE LOST LIFE POINTS
JUST FOR SUMMONING IT!

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.600
BUT OF COURSE!

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.568
THE CURSE PROVES
THAT IT'S NO FAKE!

00:16:01.568 --> 00:16:04.037
THE AZTECS PROMISED
ME THAT IT WAS REAL!

00:16:04.037 --> 00:16:05.839
AND WHAT ELSE DID
THEY PROMISE YOU?

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:08.976
MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE?

00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:10.577
HEY GRANDPA!

00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:12.713
I GOT AN ANCIENT
ARTIFACT FOR YA:

00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:14.348
IT'S YOUR WARDROBE!

00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:16.483
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THE ANCIENT AZTECS

00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:18.352
DIDN'T GIVE YOU,
IT WAS A MIRROR!

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.053
HA HA HA!

00:16:20.053 --> 00:16:21.989
OH YEAH! NOT TO
MENTION DEODORANT!

00:16:21.989 --> 00:16:23.523
YOU THINK
YOU'RE FUNNY?

00:16:23.523 --> 00:16:25.058
JUST YOU WAIT.
THE ANCIENT

00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:27.494
AND MYSTICAL POWERS
OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL

00:16:27.494 --> 00:16:29.563
WILL STOP
YOU LAUGHING
IN YOUR TRACKS!

00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:32.699
OK, GRAMPS,
STORY-TIME'S OVER.

00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:35.102
SO NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:16:35.135 --> 00:16:36.770
AND I'M STARTING OUT
WITH THIS...

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.640
MY SPELL CARD COST DOWN.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.175
Computer: COST DOWN IS
A SPELL CARD THAT DOWNGRADES

00:16:42.175 --> 00:16:45.012
ALL THE MONSTERS
IN YOUR HAND BY TWO LEVELS

00:16:45.012 --> 00:16:47.614
UNTIL THE END OF YOUR TURN.

00:16:47.614 --> 00:16:49.282
HUH?

00:16:49.282 --> 00:16:51.652
AND WHY'D YOU
DO THAT?

00:16:51.652 --> 00:16:53.186
'CAUSE YOU'RE
A FUNNY GUY, GRANDPA.

00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:55.922
N' I WANT THE CHANCE TO
EMBARRASS YOU EVEN MORE!

00:16:55.922 --> 00:16:58.091
AND THIS GUY SHOULD KEEP
THE MISERY COMING...

00:16:58.091 --> 00:17:00.093
I SUMMON USHI ONI!

00:17:00.093 --> 00:17:01.461
AND HE'S WORSE THAN
ANYONE YOU MIGHT

00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.496
RUN INTO HERE.

00:17:02.496 --> 00:17:03.630
AAH!

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.532
[ROARS]

00:17:20.864 --> 00:17:23.700
HA HA HA!
YOU LOOK SCARED, GRANDPA!

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.202
AND YOU SHOULD BE
BECAUSE THE MY USHI ONI

00:17:26.202 --> 00:17:27.871
IS ABOUT TO TURN
YOUR CRYSTAL SKULL

00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:29.706
INTO AN AZTEC RUIN.

00:17:29.706 --> 00:17:33.376
USHI ONI, TAKE OUT
THAT ANCIENT RELIC!

00:17:33.376 --> 00:17:34.611
YOU CAN'T!

00:17:34.611 --> 00:17:37.147
THE CRYSTAL SKULL IS
A PRICELESS ARTIFACT!

00:17:37.147 --> 00:17:38.915
[ROARS]

00:17:38.915 --> 00:17:39.916
AAH!

00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:47.023
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE JUST DONE?!

00:17:47.023 --> 00:17:49.826
I JUST DESTROYED
A "PRICELESS
ARTIFACT," GRAMPS!

00:17:49.826 --> 00:17:52.629
GUESS WHAT?
NOW IT REALLY IS
ANCIENT HISTORY!

00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:54.164
YOUR TURN.

00:17:54.164 --> 00:17:57.300
WELL LET'S SEE WHAT
OTHER TREASURES I
HAVE FOR YOU!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.735
HA HA! WATCH THIS!

00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:00.136
HA HA HA!

00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:02.539
THIS WAS A RARE
FIND INDEED!

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:04.541
DURING MY ADVENTURES
IN INDIA,

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.876
I DISCOVERED THIS
ASHOKA PILLAR

00:18:06.876 --> 00:18:10.613
IN THE LOST CAPITAL
OF THE MAURYA EMPIRE!

00:18:15.685 --> 00:18:17.287
HA HA HA!

00:18:17.287 --> 00:18:18.455
AMAZING.

00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:20.423
LOOKS MORE LIKE
A GIANT LAMP POST TO ME!

00:18:20.423 --> 00:18:22.625
YEAH! THAT DON'T
SEEM SO SPECIAL!

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:24.194
WELL IT IS!

00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:25.428
SEE THE ASHOKA
PILLAR IS A SOURCE

00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:28.365
OF GREAT STRENGTH
TO THE MAURYA CULTURE!

00:18:28.365 --> 00:18:30.300
IT'S OVER
A MILLENNIA OLD,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.569
AND NO ONE KNOWS QUITE
HOW IT WAS CREATED!

00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.471
I HAVE MY
SUSPICIONS.

00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.440
HEY! GRANDPA!
GIVE THE COLLEGE
LECTURE A BREAK!

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.142
THEY TRIED TO TEACH
ME THAT STUFF BACK

00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:41.044
AT THE REEDUCATION CENTER!

00:18:41.044 --> 00:18:43.480
AND I FLUNKED IT
A DOZEN TIMES!

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.850
I'D BE HAPPY TO
TUTOR YOU IN ALL
THE RELEVANT TEXTS!

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.619
FOR INSTANCE, THIS
SPIRIT MASK SPELL CARD

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.088
IS A TREASURED ARTIFACT
FROM A AFRICA TRIBE!

00:18:55.992 --> 00:18:58.528
HEH! ALL THAT'S GOOD
FOR IS HALLOWEEN!

00:18:58.528 --> 00:19:01.798
BUT IT HAS VAST
SUPERNATURAL POWERS!

00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:03.433
JUST WAIT 'TIL
NEXT TURN!

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:05.869
DON'T THINK SO!

00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:08.405
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF AZTEC-THIS,

00:19:08.405 --> 00:19:10.707
ASHOKA-THAT,
AND AFRICAN-WHATEVER!

00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:12.809
SO I THINK I'LL END
THIS LECTURE OF YOURS

00:19:12.809 --> 00:19:14.978
AND START UP
ONE OF MY OWN!

00:19:14.978 --> 00:19:18.014
SEE I RULE THIS PLACE,
AND IT'S TIME YOU LOSERS

00:19:18.014 --> 00:19:19.983

00:19:19.983 --> 00:19:21.618
NOW LETS GET THIS
CLASS STARTED.

00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:22.619
AND START UP
ONE OF MY OWN!

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:23.987
UH-OH.

00:19:23.987 --> 00:19:26.322
I SUMMON GIANT
USHI ONI!

00:19:26.322 --> 00:19:28.191
[ROARING]

00:19:32.128 --> 00:19:35.098
HEY, GRANDPA!
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
CLOSE YOUR EYES!

00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:37.767
UNLESS YOU WANT TO
SEE YOUR PILLAR
GET PULVERIZED!

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.205
HA! SO MUCH
FOR THAT!

00:19:42.205 --> 00:19:44.274
AAH!

00:19:47.277 --> 00:19:48.878
BUT WAIT, GUYS.

00:19:48.878 --> 00:19:51.881
GRAMPS WASN'T LYING ABOUT
THAT PILLAR'S STRENGTH...

00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:53.149
HUH?

00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:55.018
'CAUSE AS SOON
AS IT GETS DESTROYED,

00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.487
IT DELIVERS TWO THOUSAND
POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:58.488
TO ITS OWNER!

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.590
AAH!

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.960
AND LET'S NOT FORGET
YOUR SUPERNATURAL
SPIRIT MASK.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.695
IT WENT RIGHT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:20:05.695 --> 00:20:07.897
'N' THAT MEANS YOU TAKE
ONE CARD FROM YOUR HAND

00:20:07.897 --> 00:20:09.566
'N' THROW IT
IN AFTERWARDS

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:11.000
TO KEEP IT COMPANY!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.270
OH YEAH.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.905
HEH! TANNER'S RIGHT!

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:17.340
HE SHOULD'VE SAVED
THAT MASK

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.942
FOR SOME
MASQUERADE BALL!

00:20:18.942 --> 00:20:20.477
ERR.

00:20:20.477 --> 00:20:22.679
IF YOU WANT TO SEE
SOME REAL MAGIC,

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.481
CHECK OUT USHI'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:26.516
IF HE DESTROYS A MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:30.186
HE CAN ATTACK YOU
ALL OVER AGAIN!

00:20:30.186 --> 00:20:32.856
NOW, GIANT USHI ONI,
ATTACK!

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:33.857
AAH!

00:20:33.857 --> 00:20:35.291
[ROARS]

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:36.893
AAH! AAH!

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.266
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:20:43.266 --> 00:20:44.667
[WHIMPERING]

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:47.704
CLASS DISMISSED.

00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:49.939
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN HERE
BEFORE, GRANDPA,

00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:52.208
BUT YOU NEVER DUELED
WITH THE LIKES OF ME!

00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:54.010
N' SINCE YOU LOST,
THAT MEANS IM STILL

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.346
IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE!

00:20:56.346 --> 00:20:57.714
NOW GET OUTTA HERE.

00:20:57.714 --> 00:21:01.751
AND LEAVE YOUR
"PRECIOUS TREASURES" WITH ME!

00:21:01.784 --> 00:21:03.753
PLEASE LET ME
KEEP MY DECK!

00:21:03.753 --> 00:21:05.855
I'M... I'M JUST
AN OLD MAN,
MR. TANNER!

00:21:05.855 --> 00:21:09.993
I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE
LIFE COLLECTING ALL
THESE RARE CARDS!

00:21:09.993 --> 00:21:12.795
THESE CARDS ARE ALL
I HAVE LEFT,
YOU UNDERSTAND!

00:21:12.795 --> 00:21:14.364
THEY'RE LIKE
MY CHILDREN!

00:21:14.364 --> 00:21:16.833
THESE CARDS
ARE SO SPECIAL
AND SO DELICATE

00:21:16.833 --> 00:21:19.302
THAT THEY REQUIRE
PROPER SUPERVISION!

00:21:19.302 --> 00:21:20.870
I'VE CLIMBED
MOUNT EVEREST,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.539
I'VE SURVIVED
THE SAHARAN HEAT,

00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:24.240
I'VE TOUCHED
THE NORTH
AND SOUTH POLES,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.643
AND IN ALL THESE
AMAZING TRAVELS,

00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:29.846
THERE'S NOTHING
AS PRECIOUS
AS THESE CARDS!

00:21:29.846 --> 00:21:31.681
JUS' OPEN YOUR HEART
AND LET ME KEEP

00:21:31.681 --> 00:21:33.683
THEM SAFE
AND SOUND!

00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:35.485
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

00:21:37.921 --> 00:21:43.126
UGH! UNH! AAH!

00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:47.263
LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST
EARNED YOURSELF A DUEL!

00:21:47.263 --> 00:21:49.699
CAN I BORROW YOUR CARDS?

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:53.002
I CAN SEE THE TRUE VALUE
OF YOUR TREASURE DECK.

00:21:53.002 --> 00:21:54.404
WHAT?
HUH?

00:21:54.404 --> 00:21:56.806
YOU THINK THIS
TREASURE DECK IS WORTHLESS?

00:21:56.806 --> 00:21:59.075
THEN PROVE IT, TANNER.

00:21:59.075 --> 00:22:01.978
DUEL YOU?
WITH THAT DECK?

00:22:01.978 --> 00:22:04.581
PLEASE, I WANT
A CHALLENGE.

00:22:04.581 --> 00:22:06.282
AND YOU'LL GET ONE.

00:22:06.282 --> 00:22:08.518
YOU SAID WE DUEL
HERE FOR RESPECT.

00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:09.919
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU LEARN WHAT

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:11.921
THAT REALLY MEANS.

00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:13.256
AHH.
