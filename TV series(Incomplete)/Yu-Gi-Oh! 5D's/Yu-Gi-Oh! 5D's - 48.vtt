00:09:40.822 --> 00:09:42.857
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME!

00:09:42.857 --> 00:09:47.795
AND THEN WHEN I'M THROUGH
WITH YOU, I'M COMING AFTER
YOUR SISTER NEXT!

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:08.842
LOOK, THERE MUST BE
A SHADOW DUEL THERE.

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:11.678
YOU'RE RIGHT, MINA,
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE.

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:14.348
FOR SOME REASON MY DRAGON
SIGN'S NOT GLOWING.

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:20.487
Jack:
LUNA'S SUPPOSED TO BE DUELING
UNDER THAT SHADOW MARK,

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.756
BUT I CAN'T FEEL
OUR SIGNER CONNECTION.

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:25.726
IT'S LIKE SHE FELL OFF THE FACE
OF THE EARTH.

00:10:25.726 --> 00:10:27.094
WHERE DID SHE GO?

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:28.462
BEATS ME BOSS!

00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:30.697
I THINK I SAW HER!

00:10:30.697 --> 00:10:32.099
HUH?

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:41.174
WE'RE SAFE.
FOR NOW.

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.076
I WOULD'VE BEEN MONKEY
BAIT WITHOUT YOUR HELP,

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.478
SO THANK YOU!

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:50.350
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
ANY DUEL SPIRIT I'VE
SEEN, SO WHO ARE YOU?

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.119
UM...

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.856
AN OLD LEGEND SAYS A LITTLE GIRL
WILL APPEAR AND SAVE US ALL!

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:57.324
I ASSUME IT'S YOU.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:59.192
SO STOP STANDING AROUND
AND GET TO WORK!

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:03.063
FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT
A LITTLE GIRL, AND SECOND
OF ALL, WHAT LEGEND?

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:06.199
I'M NOT PART OF ANY
LEGEND, I'M JUST HERE
TO FREE MY DRAGON!

00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:08.368
ANCIENT FAIRY,
AM I RIGHT?

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:10.170
AND REGULUS IS
GOING TO HELP, TOO.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.438
HUH?

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.740
SEE? NOW HOW
WOULD I KNOW ALL THAT

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.776
IF YOU'RE NOT TIED
TO THAT OLD LEGEND?

00:11:17.244 --> 00:11:19.112
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
BY THE WAY?

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:20.447
I'M TURUNKA.

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:22.582
I'M LUNA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:24.651
SSSH.
WE HAVE TO BE QUIET.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:26.887
WHY ARE THOSE
MONKEY SOLDIERS

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:30.157
TURNING ALL THE DUEL
SPIRITS INTO STONE
TABLETS?

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:31.858
BEATS ME.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.194
ALL WE KNOW IS THEY
TAKE THEM TO SOME
CASTLE HIDDEN FAR AWAY.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:37.464
A FEW OF US ESCAPED,
BUT NOW WE'RE UNDER
THE MINUS CURSE.

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:39.566
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE
YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHER.

00:11:39.566 --> 00:11:42.436
BUT THE MONKEYS MADE US ALL
LOOK THIS YOUNG.

00:11:42.436 --> 00:11:44.338
UM, IS IT CONTAGIOUS?

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:46.773
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE COMPLETELY SAFE.

00:11:46.773 --> 00:11:50.010
IT ONLY AFFECTS DUEL SPIRITS,
BUT NOW WE'RE TOO WEAK
TO DO ANYTHING!

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.511
HOW'D THIS START?!

00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:53.413
WHY WOULD ANYONE
DO THIS?!

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:54.581
[SIGHS]

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.816
IT'S A COMPLETE MYSTERY.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:59.119
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT ONE DAY
THE SHADOWS CAME.

00:11:59.152 --> 00:12:02.556
BEFORE, THE DUEL SPIRITS
ALL LIVED IN HARMONY.

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:07.527
IN YOUR DECKS, WE MIGHT FIGHT,
BUT HERE, WE WERE FREE TO LIVE
LIVES OF PEACE.

00:12:07.527 --> 00:12:10.497
WIZARD AND BEAST, FAIRY AND
DRAGON, WE ALL LIVED TOGETHER.

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:13.400
THAT IS, UNTIL
THE SKY GREW DARK.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.736
NO ONE KNEW HIS NAME
OR SAW HIS FACE,

00:12:15.736 --> 00:12:18.739
BUT THE FIGURE IN THE SHADOWS
BROUGHT WITH HIM AN ARMY.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:21.475
THEY HAD WEAPONS... STAFFS...
THEY USED FOR BATTLE.

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:26.413
WITH BUT ONE STRIKE, THEY COULD
TURN THE MOST POWERFUL DUEL
SPIRIT INTO STONE.

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:28.582
SOON, THE CITIES WERE SILENT.

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.650
THE FIELDS EMPTY.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.219
AND THAT'S WHERE
YOU COME IN.

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.620
AH...

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.256
I KNOW I PROMISED
TO HELP SAVE THE
SPIRIT WORLD,

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.525
BUT I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO MY WORLD AND HELP
MY BROTHER.

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:40.193
THE LEGEND IS CLEAR!

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:43.029
YOU WILL SAVE YOUR DRAGON
AND ALL OF US ALONG WITH IT!

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:44.898
BUT I'M NOT REALLY
THE LEGEND TYPE,

00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:47.601
MY TEACHERS BARELY
EVEN REMEMBER MY NAME!

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.971
WELL, SOMEONE THINKS
YOU'RE IMPORTANT, OR YOU
WOULDN'T BE A SIGNER!

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.506
YOU KNOW THAT?!

00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:55.108
OK, FINE, LET'S SAY THAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP.

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:57.010
WHERE DO I FIND
THIS REGULUS GUY?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.247
IT'S, UH... NOT AS EASY
AS IT SOUNDS, I'M AFRAID.

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:01.748
IT NEVER IS, IS IT?

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.650
REGULUS IS
THE SWORN PROTECTOR

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.119
OF ALL THE SPIRITS
THAT LIVE IN THIS WORLD.

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:10.190
BUT NOW HE'S BEEN ACTING
DIFFERENT EVER SINCE ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON WAS TAKEN FROM US.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.360
WE THINK MAYBE THE MINUS
CURSE IS INFECTING HIM,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.228
TURNING HIS HEART BLACK.

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:18.732
NOW HE JUST ROAMS THE FOREST,
ATTACKING ANYTHING THAT
COMES TOO CLOSE!

00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:20.300
[GROWLS]

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.369
BUT, WE NEED HIM!

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.905
YOU EVEN SAID THAT HE'S
PART OF THIS LEGEND,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:27.207
IN THE LAST DAY,
I'VE SEEN SHADOW DUELS,

00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:29.409
TALKING MONKEYS
AND THE BEGINNING OF
THE END OF THE WORLD!

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:32.512
SO CURSED OR NOT,
WE'VE GOTTA FIND
REGULUS!

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.714
WHADDYA MEAN WE?

00:13:34.714 --> 00:13:36.450
WHAT CAN I DO
TRAPPED IN THIS BODY?

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.884
FINE, THEN!

00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.320
I'LL DO THIS
ALL BY MYSELF!

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.222
IT'S NOT THAT I'M SCARED.
IT'S JUST THAT...

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.857
OK, MAYBE I AM SCARED.

00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:46.126
FINE!
STAY HERE ALONE!

00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.096
ON SECOND THOUGHT...

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:52.599
I'M GLAD YOU CAME WITH ME.

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.234
DON'T RUN SO FAST...

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:56.369
I'M AN OLD MAN,
REMEMBER?!

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:58.805
AH! THIS WAY!

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:00.407
AH! THEY FOUND US!

00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:02.108
HOW PERCEPTIVE OF YOU!

00:14:05.378 --> 00:14:06.713
I HAVE AN IDEA!

00:14:06.713 --> 00:14:08.582
HOW DO THOSE STAFFS WORK?

00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:11.418
YOU FLIP THE SWITCH AT THE TOP
AND THEN THINGS GO BACKWARDS.

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:13.520
PERFECT!

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.859
[SNARLING]

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.563
PRETTY GOOD.

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:25.232
THANKS! NOW, LET'S
GET OUTTA HERE!

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:27.100
NOT SO FAST, OK?!

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:36.109
WELL, WE GOT RID
OF THE MONKEYS!

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:37.544
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN TAKE
A BREAK?

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:38.745
AHH...

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:40.647
COME ON!

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:42.482
DIDN'T YOU SAY WE STILL
HAD A LONG WAY LEFT?

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.084
YOU HAVE A LONG WAY.

00:14:44.084 --> 00:14:45.519
IT'S MY NAP TIME.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.053
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.889
I'M NOT TAKING
ONE MORE STEP.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.658
ALL RIGHT. THEN YOU
LEAVE ME WITH NO CHOICE.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:53.393
AH. GET ON.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.628
WHAT?

00:14:54.628 --> 00:14:56.930
COME ON. YOU HEARD
WHAT I JUST SAID.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.766
HUH? WELL, THANKS, LUNA.

00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:06.473
NOW, BE CAREFUL,
MY SCIATICA IS ACTING UP.

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:09.109
WHA'D YOU MEAN
BEFORE ABOUT
SAVING YOUR BROTHER?

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.510
I HAVE A TWIN.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.078
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:13.847
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO A SHADOW DUEL,

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:15.749
BUT I THINK
HE TOOK MY PLACE.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.083
I'M SURE THAT
HE'S FINE!

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:18.985
I SENSE THE POWER
OF THE DRAGON IN YOU.

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.921
IT MUST FLOW THROUGH
HIS SPIRIT, TOO.

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:23.823
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF IT WORKS LIKE THAT.

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:27.827
LEO IS ALWAYS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME NO MATTER
WHAT THE DANGER IS!

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:30.063
BUT YOU HAVE THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:31.798
AREN'T YOU THE BEST
AT DUELING?

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:35.468
UH-UH. LEO'S GOT
ALL THE SKILL.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:38.104
[GRUNTING]

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:40.307
I HOPE THIS WORKS....

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:41.808
OK.

00:15:41.808 --> 00:15:43.777
FINALLY!

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:46.813
I SUMMON MORPHTRONIC
CELFON TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.294
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO
DIAL UP SOME TROUBLE!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.496
SEE, SINCE MY CELFON'S
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:16:03.496 --> 00:16:06.232
HE CHOOSES A NUMBER
BETWEEN 1 AND 6.

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.835
WHATEVER HE PICKS,
I CAN DRAW THAT
MANY CARDS.

00:16:08.835 --> 00:16:10.804
AND IF THERE'S ANOTHER
MORPHTRONIC IN THERE,

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.672
I CAN SUMMON HIM
AUTOMATICALLY!

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:14.107
3!

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:15.875
ALL RIGHT!

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:19.179
HOPE YOU BROUGHT
YOUR EARBUDS!

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:22.015
I SUMMON...
MORPHTRONIC REMOTEN!

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.321
THAT'S QUITE...
ENTERTAINING.

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:31.358
YEAH, WELL, THIS PARTY'S
JUST GETTING STARTED!

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:35.095
I ACTIVATE
LEVEL MIRRORING!

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:37.464
NOW I GET TO CHOOSE
A MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:39.566
AND MATCH HIS LEVEL
TO ONE OF MINE.

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:43.570
IN OTHER WORDS,
MAGNEN'S NOW AS
TOUGH AS YOUR APE!

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.105
AND WITH THAT
POWER BOOST,

00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.740
IT'S TIME TA GET
THINGS ROCKIN',

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.541
SO NOW I TUNE MY REMOTEN

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:50.777
WITH MY MAGNEN BAR
AND CELFON

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:53.446
TO MORPH MY MORPHTRONICS
INTO SOMETHING NEW!

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.589
I SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:17:02.589 --> 00:17:05.158
MY POWER TOOL DRAGON!

00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:10.964
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:13.433
NOW LEO'S ADDED A LITTLE
FIREPOWER TO HIS SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:16.102
I DIDN'T THINK THE KID HAD
A COMBO LIKE THAT IN HIM!

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.737
[THINKING]
IT'S A GOOD START.

00:17:17.737 --> 00:17:20.240
AND I KNOW IT'S ONLY
GOING TO GET BETTER!

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.808
[CHUCKLING]

00:17:21.808 --> 00:17:24.344
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?!

00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:29.649
BECAUSE IF IT IS, YOURS
IS A FUTURE BATHED IN SHADOW!

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.284
[OMINOUS LAUGHTER]

00:17:48.831 --> 00:17:51.801
THAT'S NO SIGNER DRAGON!

00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:54.103
THAT'S A TOY YOU SHOULD HAVE
LEFT IN YOUR PLAYROOM.

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.438
I HOPE YOUR SISTER

00:17:55.438 --> 00:17:57.940
WILL BE
MORE OF A CHALLENGE.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.642
TOO BAD YOU'LL
NEVER FIND OUT

00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:01.677
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO
TAKE YOUR GAME APART.

00:18:01.677 --> 00:18:04.580
FIRST I ACTIVATE MY
DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.383
WHICH LETS ME ADD
A RANDOM EQUIP SPELL
TO MY HAND!

00:18:07.383 --> 00:18:09.385
AND AS LUCK
WOULD HAVE IT,

00:18:09.385 --> 00:18:12.188
I GET TO USE THE POWER
OF BREAK DRAW!

00:18:12.188 --> 00:18:15.624
SO AS SOON AS MY POWER
TOOL DRAGON DESTROYS
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS,

00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:17.626
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD.

00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:20.262
YOU MIGHT THINK MY
CARDS ARE NO MATCH
FOR YOUR DARK DECK,

00:18:20.262 --> 00:18:22.364
BUT I'M ABOUT TO SHED
SOME LIGHT ON THE FACT

00:18:22.364 --> 00:18:25.668
THAT MY MONSTERS ARE
THE BEST BEASTS AROUND!

00:18:25.668 --> 00:18:26.802
[ROAR]

00:18:26.802 --> 00:18:29.572
NOW... ATTACK
MAGICIAN APE!

00:18:33.142 --> 00:18:35.044
ARGH!

00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:38.347
WELL, THAT WAS QUITE
THE VANISHING ACT,
WASN'T IT?!

00:18:38.347 --> 00:18:40.549
NOW IF YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:42.551
ABOUT THE POWER OF MY
DRAGON, GO RIGHT AHEAD!

00:18:43.853 --> 00:18:45.488
NOTHING?

00:18:45.488 --> 00:18:47.957
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DRAGON GOT YOUR TONGUE?

00:18:47.957 --> 00:18:49.892
JOKE ALL YOU WANT.

00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:54.363
IT'S MY TURN NOW,
AND YOUR DRAGON'S
ABOUT TO MEET ITS MATCH!

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:57.867
OH. I'VE BEEN
WONDERING SOMETHING...

00:18:57.867 --> 00:18:59.535
WHAT IS IT?

00:18:59.535 --> 00:19:02.371
WHAT HAPPENS
AT THIS SECRET CASTLE
WITH ALL THE DUEL SPIRITS?

00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:03.806
WELL, NO ONE KNOWS
FOR SURE

00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:06.308
BUT THE RUMOR IS THAT
ZEMAN THE APE KING

00:19:06.308 --> 00:19:07.943
LINES HIS CASTLE
WITH THEM.

00:19:07.943 --> 00:19:09.912
BUT WHAT DOES HE WANT?

00:19:09.912 --> 00:19:12.848
IS HE ON THE
DARK SIGNERS' SIDE?

00:19:12.848 --> 00:19:14.116
MAYBE.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.085
AND IF HE IS,
WE BETTER STOP HIM

00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:19.221
OR ELSE WE'RE LOOKING
AT THE END OF THE ENTIRE
DUEL SPIRIT REALM...

00:19:19.221 --> 00:19:22.024
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR WORLD AS WELL!

00:19:22.024 --> 00:19:24.660
THEN I THINK ITS TIME
WE FOUND OUT!

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.296
Zeman The Ape King:
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS
WE'VE WAITED...

00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:30.966
WATCHING WHILE THE SPIRITS
SPREAD OVER THIS WORLD
LIKE A PLAGUE.

00:19:30.966 --> 00:19:33.502
IT IS OUR TURN TO RULE.

00:19:33.502 --> 00:19:37.606
NOW, ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON
WILL DO MY BIDDING!

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:40.543
BLAST IT! AH!

00:19:40.543 --> 00:19:44.980
WITH REGULUS STILL FREE
I CANNOT ABSORB ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON'S POWER.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.286
BUT IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE I ADD HIM
TO MY COLLECTION AS WELL!

00:19:50.286 --> 00:19:52.688
[EVIL LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.688 --> 00:19:55.825
Devack:
I SENSE GOOD THINGS.

00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:57.426
HA HA!

00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.128
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

00:19:59.128 --> 00:20:02.464
YOU HUMAN BEINGS,
SO NARROW MINDED.

00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:06.368
YOU HAVE NO IDEA THAT THIS
BATTLE IS BEING WAGED IN
THE SPIRIT WORLD AS WELL.

00:20:06.368 --> 00:20:09.939
I ASSUME THAT'S WHERE
YOUR POOR SISTER IS
RIGHT NOW, ISN'T SHE?

00:20:09.939 --> 00:20:11.674
LEAVE LUNA OUTTA THIS!

00:20:11.674 --> 00:20:13.108
YOU'RE DUELIN' ME.

00:20:13.142 --> 00:20:14.777
NOW DRAW YOUR CARD
AND GO!

00:20:14.777 --> 00:20:16.278
MY PLEASURE.

00:20:16.278 --> 00:20:18.747
THOUGH ONCE YOU SEE
WHAT I HAVE IN MIND,

00:20:18.747 --> 00:20:20.850
YOU'LL WISH I WAITED!

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.888
NOW MEET YOUR DOOM
IN THE GUISE OF MY DARK
TUNER MONSTER DARK APE!

00:20:25.888 --> 00:20:28.924
[ROARS, CHITTERING]

00:20:28.924 --> 00:20:30.059
WHA-?!

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:31.627
BUT ITS POWERLESS?!

00:20:31.627 --> 00:20:33.362
NOT FOR LONG.
JUST WATCH.

00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:36.765
YOUR FRIEND YUSEI KNOWS
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

00:20:36.765 --> 00:20:40.836
BEHOLD: BY USING
MY DARK WAVE SPELL

00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:44.506
I CAN CONVERT A MONSTER'S
LEVEL INTO NEGATIVE ENERGY.

00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:47.776
NOW YOU CAN WITNESS
THE REAL PURPOSE
OF MY DARK APE,

00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:51.013
AS I USE HIM TO COMBINE
FORCES WITH FIGHTER APE!

00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:07.296
WHEN THE SHADOWS ARE DEVOURED
BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS,

00:21:07.296 --> 00:21:09.899
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS...

00:21:09.899 --> 00:21:12.234
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:21:12.234 --> 00:21:16.872
COME FORTH ZEMAAAAAAN
THE APE KING!

00:21:16.872 --> 00:21:18.474
[GROWLS]

00:21:20.476 --> 00:21:23.112
GOOD LUCK USING
ANY SPELLS OR TRAPS,

00:21:23.145 --> 00:21:26.882
SINCE THE STRENGTH OF THIS KING
OVERRULES ALL THEIR POWERS!

00:21:26.882 --> 00:21:28.951
[GASPS]

00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:31.320
SO WHAT?!
ALL I NEED IS MY DRAGON!

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.122
HE'S GOT MORE
ATTACK POINTS

00:21:33.122 --> 00:21:35.524
THAN YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE MONKEY
HAS ANYWAY.

00:21:38.227 --> 00:21:41.697
YEAH! LOOKS LIKE OLD DEVACK
MADE A LITTLE ERROR IN JUDGMENT,

00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:43.165
EH, YUSEI?

00:21:43.165 --> 00:21:46.635
MY ONLY ERROR HAS BEEN NOT
FINISHING YOU OFF SOONER.

00:21:46.635 --> 00:21:49.371
BUT I'LL RECTIFY THAT
RIGHT NOW!

00:21:51.974 --> 00:21:53.042
UH...

00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:57.079
I PLAY THE FIELD SPELL
CLOSED FOREST!

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:58.547
NOT A FIELD SPELL!

00:21:58.547 --> 00:21:59.715
OH, NO!

00:21:59.715 --> 00:22:01.951
NOW DEVACK'S GOT
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS

00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:04.954
TO SUMMON ONE OF
THOSE EARTHBOUND
IMMORTALS AGAINST LEO!

00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:11.393
AH!

00:22:14.396 --> 00:22:16.966
Luna: THIS IS WHERE
REGULUS LIVES?

00:22:16.966 --> 00:22:19.168
IT USED TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL FOREST.

00:22:19.168 --> 00:22:23.405
I GUESS THAT WAS BEFORE
ZEMAN THE APE KING

00:22:23.405 --> 00:22:25.874
MADE EVERYTHING
GO BACKWARDS AND
STOLE DUEL SPIRITS.

00:22:25.874 --> 00:22:27.876
I'M AFRAID
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT.

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:30.546
LIKE I SAID, WITH THE
FOREST WITHERING AWAY,

00:22:30.546 --> 00:22:33.615
SPRITS BEING KIDNAPPED,
KING REGULUS WENT MAD!

00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:34.917
HEY!
KING REGULUS!

00:22:34.917 --> 00:22:36.118
WE NEED YOU!

00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:37.619
BE QUIET!

00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:40.055
HE'S MAD, NOT
HARD OF HEARING!

00:22:40.055 --> 00:22:41.290
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.192
AFTER ALL, I'VE GOT
A KITTEN AT HOME!

00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:45.661
HEY, KITTY,
KITTY, KITTY!

00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:47.696
I'VE GOT A NICE TREAT
FOR YOU.

00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:49.264
STOP! AH!

00:22:51.233 --> 00:22:54.503
UM... HI? AH!

00:22:54.503 --> 00:22:56.105
[GROWLING]

00:22:58.474 --> 00:23:00.409
[ROARS]

00:23:01.977 --> 00:23:04.480
HE CAME FOR A TREAT,
ALL RIGHT.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.049
AND I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE US!
