00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:02.536
NOW LET'S GET UP TO
SPEED WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's"

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:04.204
WHAT DID YOU
WANNA ASK ME?

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:07.107
I'M INVESTIGATING
THAT CRIMSON DRAGON
THING THAT APPEARED

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.308
DURING
THE FORTUNE CUP, AND...

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:11.345
THAT LED YOU TO INVESTIGATE
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.447
YEAH... AND I FOUND
OUT THAT YOU HAD

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.115
SOME CONNECTION
TO THEM?

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.884
THEY MANAGED TO SINK
THEIR CLAWS

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.353
INTO MY YOUNGER BROTHER,
AND THEY TOOK HIM FROM ME.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.021
OHH!

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.322
THE LAST TIME I SAW
MY BROTHER,

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.291
HE HAD JUST COME BACK
FROM WATCHING A DUEL.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:25.659
HE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:28.128
HE WAS GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT "THE MOVEMENT."

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.796
I ASKED HIM WHAT
HE MEANT,

00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:31.532
AND SUDDENLY
WE WERE FIGHTING,

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.866
AND THEN HE STORMED OFF,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.002
AND I NEVER SAW
HIM AGAIN.

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:37.304
IT'S TIME FOR THE MOVEMENT
TO SEEK MEMBERS

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.072
ACROSS THE GLOBE,
AND WHO BEST TO HELP

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.241

FORTUNE CUP PARTICIPANT?

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:43.477
YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME
THE LIVING SYMBOL

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.679
OF THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.015
YOU'RE GOING TO TO LEAD
A LOT OF LOST SOULS

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.716
TO THE ONE PLACE THEY
CAN TURN TO, AKIZA,

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.019
PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO LOVE YOU.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.022
WHAT IS THIS ARCADIA
MOVEMENT REALLY ABOUT?

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.658

WHAT YOU'VE SEEN,

I CAN'T LET YOU LEAVE.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.269
ALLOW ME TO AT LEAST GIVE
YOU A FIGHTING CHANCE.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.638
YOU CAN TRY TO RUN
OR YOU CAN DUEL ME.

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:13.307

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.208

00:09:42.636 --> 00:09:44.638
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
IS AUTOMATICALLY
DESTROYED!

00:09:45.305 --> 00:09:46.507
AND THERE'S MORE,
DEAR SAYER.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.142
UNFORTUNATELY,
ALL THE POINTS

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:50.777
OF THE MONSTER YOU JUST
LOST TURN TO DAMAGE!

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:52.446
YOU CAN'T!

00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:55.215
I CAN AND I WILL,
NOW WATCH AND LEARN!

00:09:55.883 --> 00:09:58.385
DESTROY MAGICAL ANDROID!

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.991
AAH!

00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:08.929
ARGH! UNH! OHH!

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:15.435
I... I'VE NEVER FELT
AN ATTACK LIKE THAT.

00:10:16.103 --> 00:10:18.639
THAT ENERGY JUST NOW
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING
I'VE FACED BEFORE.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:20.307
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:22.476
THE POWER
OF THE SHADOWS
IS LIMITLESS.

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:25.479
WELL, CARLY,
SO IS MINE.

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:27.381
YOUR POWER PALES
IN COMPARISON

00:10:28.048 --> 00:10:29.216
TO THAT
OF THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:10:29.883 --> 00:10:32.953
FORTUNE LADY FIRE,
ATTACK HIM DIRECTLY!

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.323
AAH! UGH!

00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:42.162
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD
A TASTE OF MY POWER,

00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:44.264
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:10:44.932 --> 00:10:46.633
UNLESS YOU DO
SOMETHING AND QUICK

00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:49.469
I'M AFRAID THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE
OUR LITTLE DUEL

00:10:49.536 --> 00:10:52.906
AND END UP
IN THE NETHERWORLD!

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:12.330
WHY CAN'T WE
SEE ANYTHING?
COME ON!

00:11:12.998 --> 00:11:15.267
I DON'T REMEMBER
US SUBSCRIBING
TO THE STATIC CHANNEL?!

00:11:15.567 --> 00:11:16.568
WHERE'S THE PICTURE!

00:11:16.835 --> 00:11:17.836
AH, THERE WE GO.

00:11:18.036 --> 00:11:19.838
OHH! WHAT IS THAT?!

00:11:20.505 --> 00:11:23.508
NO! GOODWIN!
A DARK SIGN!

00:11:24.175 --> 00:11:25.243
BUT, WHAT'S IT
DOING HERE?!

00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:28.847
A SIGN IN OUR CITY CAN
ONLY MEAN ONE THING, LAZAR.

00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:30.482
A SHADOW DUEL?!

00:11:30.782 --> 00:11:32.984
BUT I THOUGHT
THE DARK SIGNERS WERE
IN THE SATELLITE!

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:34.753
AND NOW, THEY'RE
FIGHTING HERE?!

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.489
GOODWIN, WHAT
IN THE DECK
IS GOING ON?!

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.525
SAYER? ANYONE?

00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:42.193
HELLO? COME ON!

00:11:42.627 --> 00:11:43.628
STOP KIDDING AROUND!

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:45.263
Misty: LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE?

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.631
I'M AFRAID SAYER
IS A LITTLE,

00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:50.168
HOW SHOULD I SAY,
OCCUPIED.

00:11:52.304 --> 00:11:55.707
WAIT I KNOW YOU!
YOU'RE THAT MODEL!

00:11:56.374 --> 00:11:58.643
I DO HAPPEN TO HAVE
A NAME YOU KNOW:
IT'S MISTY.

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:01.813
YOU'RE FAMOUS YOURSELF
AREN'T YOU, MISS AKIZA?

00:12:02.447 --> 00:12:04.482
OR DO YOU PREFER
"BLACK ROSE"?

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.485
TELL ME, ARE YOU
REALLY A WITCH?

00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:11.156
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS, MISS WHATEVER
YOU'RE CALLING YOURSELF.

00:12:11.823 --> 00:12:13.258
I WANT MY BROTHER BACK.

00:12:13.925 --> 00:12:14.926
YOUR BROTHER?!

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.161
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM!

00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:17.629
WHY DO YOU THINK I DO?

00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:19.264
ENOUGH LIES!

00:12:19.664 --> 00:12:22.834
I WANT ANSWERS
AND I WANT THEM NOW,
MISS AKIZA.

00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.871
YOUR GROUP OF PSYCHICS...
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT...
STOLE HIM.

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:30.542
SO NOW, I'LL GIVE
YOU ONE MORE CHANCE
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH:

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.812
WHERE. IS.
MY BROTHER, BLACK ROSE?

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:36.748
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
THAT I DON'T KNOW!

00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:38.817
THEN WE DUEL.

00:12:39.484 --> 00:12:41.386
FINE! LET'S GO!

00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:45.156
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
I HAD HOPED IT MIGHT
COME TO THIS.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.359
A DUEL SHOULD BE
THE PERFECT CHANCE

00:12:48.026 --> 00:12:49.461
TO TRY OUT SOME
OF THE NEW ABILITIES

00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:51.229
THAT I'VE RECENTLY
BEEN OFFERED.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.833
YOU SEE, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO'S
KEEPING A BIG SECRET.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.968
DO NOT LET MY
PERFECT FACE FOOL YOU,

00:12:57.602 --> 00:12:58.603
FOR I AM
A DARK SIGNER

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.072
WHO HAS COME TO SEND YOU
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.975
YOU'RE A DARK SIGNER??!!

00:13:09.814 --> 00:13:12.217
UNH! MY SIGN!

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:20.358
HUH?

00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:22.127
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:13:22.794 --> 00:13:23.862
THE TRUTH,
AND I'LL GET IT

00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:26.231
EVEN IF I HAVE TO
SHAKE IT OUT OF YOU.

00:13:26.898 --> 00:13:27.899
WHAT'S THIS?!

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:30.268
ISN'T ONE EARTHQUAKE
ENOUGH?!

00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:35.840
THIS WAS A NICE NIGHT
FOR A RIDE.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.182
HUH?

00:13:44.849 --> 00:13:45.850
WHAT?!

00:13:46.251 --> 00:13:48.920
I BEST GET
A BETTER LOOK AT THIS!

00:14:00.865 --> 00:14:02.834
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?!

00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:15.013
[WHIMPERING]

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.384
TWO DARK SIGNS?
THIS IS QUITE UNEXPECTED.

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:23.421
Jack: THIS LOOKS
AWFULLY FAMILIAR.

00:14:25.356 --> 00:14:28.226
HMM. HUH?

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:37.702
THAT'S OVER
NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:40.305
MY SIGN IT'S GLOWING.

00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:42.340
AND THAT CAN ONLY
MEAN ONE THING.

00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:45.143
A SHADOW DUEL IS
ABOUT TO START.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.446
IT'S SIGNER VERSUS
DARK SIGNER, BUT WHERE?

00:14:49.114 --> 00:14:50.281
THE ARCADIA BUILDING?!

00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:53.585
TIME TO KICK IT
INTO OVERDRIVE.

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:01.826
AAH!

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.667
WHAT'S THIS?!
SOME PURPLE
FIRE BLOCKADE?!

00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:11.736
LOOKS LIKE YOUR TRIP
TO THE FACILITY

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.338
JUST GOT DELAYED,
GREIGER.

00:15:14.005 --> 00:15:16.508
I'M SURE YOU'RE
REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.679
GRAMPS!
YOU OKAY?

00:15:22.347 --> 00:15:23.782
WELL, GUESS THAT
KINDA DEPENDS.

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:26.618
WE STILL
LOCKED UP IN SOME
UNDERGROUND BASEMENT?

00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:28.286
I GUESS SO.

00:15:28.353 --> 00:15:29.788
BUT THAT AFTERSHOCK
GAVE ME AN IDEA

00:15:30.155 --> 00:15:32.724
ON GETTIN'
OUTTA HERE!

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.027
IT MIGHT'A LOOSENED
THE WHOLE FOUNDATION!

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:42.734
YES! THAT'S USING
YOUR HEAD!

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.402
EASY.

00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:45.136
AND NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS FIND THE TWINS

00:15:45.804 --> 00:15:48.039
BEFORE THIS BUILDING
COMES DOWN.

00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:08.809
IF I CAN'T MAKE
YOU REVEAL MY
BROTHER'S FATE,

00:16:09.377 --> 00:16:10.378
MY DECK WILL.

00:16:10.778 --> 00:16:13.814
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
DID, AKIZA.

00:16:14.482 --> 00:16:15.716
I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO SAY IT,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.719
BUT THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
WOULDN'T HURT OR HIDE ANYONE.

00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:20.388
IT'S ONLY HERE TO HELP!

00:16:21.055 --> 00:16:25.626
BUT IF YOU WANNA DUEL
THEN I THINK I SHOULD
AT LEAST DEFEND MYSELF.

00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:29.096
AFTER ALL,
THIS IS MY HOME.

00:16:29.764 --> 00:16:31.699
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
SOME DARK SIGNER PUSH ME

00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:34.168
AROUND IN MY OWN PLACE!

00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:36.003
HMM.

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.978
LET'S DO THIS!
LET'S DO THIS!

00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:45.646
I'M FIRST.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.983
AND I SUMMON
TWILIGHT ROSE KNIGHT!

00:16:50.851 --> 00:16:53.354
AND LUCKY FOR ME,
I CAN USE HIS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:55.022
AS SOON AS HE'S SUMMONED!

00:16:55.656 --> 00:16:57.324
SO NOW, I CAN ADD
A LEVEL 4 OR BELOW

00:16:57.992 --> 00:16:59.627
PLANT TYPE MONSTER
FROM MY HAND AND SUMMON

00:17:00.294 --> 00:17:05.433
IT DIRECTLY TO MY FIELD,
AND I THINK I'LL BRING
OUT LORD POISON!

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:09.837
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO
INVITE YOU TO WITNESS

00:17:10.504 --> 00:17:15.075
THE ROYAL ENGAGEMENT
OF MY ROSE KNIGHT
AND LORD POISON.

00:17:23.617 --> 00:17:27.188
BLACK ROSE DRAGON,
WELCOME TO THE GAME!

00:17:31.992 --> 00:17:33.594
HMPH. IMPRESSIVE.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:35.696
WIELDING A POWERFUL
BEAST LIKE THAT

00:17:36.297 --> 00:17:38.666
IS A TESTAMENT TO WHY
YOU WERE CHOSEN TO BE
A SIGNER.

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:42.002
I WONDER
IF YOUR CALLING WAS
SIMILAR TO MINE.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.871
HER VITALS
ARE DROPPING DOCTOR!

00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:46.040
WE HAVE TO GET HER
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM!

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.442
I KNEW I HAD ONE REASON
TO STAY ALIVE:

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:51.145
I HAD TO FIND MY BROTHER
AND TAKE REVENGE

00:17:51.812 --> 00:17:53.047
ON THOSE WHO TOOK HIM
FROM ME.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.150
SO I MADE A DEAL.

00:17:56.817 --> 00:17:58.519
AND NOW THE POWER
OF THE SHADOWS

00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:00.454
HAS GIVEN ME
A NEW LEASE ON LIFE

00:18:00.688 --> 00:18:02.490
AND THE CHANCE
TO FINALLY DISCOVER
THE TRUTH.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.625
AND ONCE YOU TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,

00:18:05.025 --> 00:18:07.328
THE SHADOWS
WILL ENVELOPE
YOU AND YOUR DECK.

00:18:07.995 --> 00:18:08.996
WELL THESE
THREE FACEDOWNS

00:18:09.597 --> 00:18:11.332
ARE GOING TO PUT
A STOP TO THAT PLAN.

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.000
YOUR TURN.

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:14.835
THEN I DRAW.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.876
I ACTIVATE
THE FIELD SPELL
SAVAGE COLISEUM!

00:18:22.543 --> 00:18:24.879
NOW AS LONG AS THIS
CARD'S IN PLAY,

00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:28.849
EVERY MONSTER
THAT'S IN ATTACK MODE
ACTUALLY HAS TO ATTACK.

00:18:29.517 --> 00:18:31.519
NOT ONLY THAT,
FOR AS LONG AS
THIS CARD'S IN PLAY,

00:18:32.052 --> 00:18:33.787
I GET THREE HUNDRED
ADDITIONAL LIFE POINTS

00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:35.656
EVERY TIME
A MONSTER BATTLES.

00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:40.361
AND TO KEEP THINGS SAFE,
I'LL BE ACTIVATING
ANOTHER SPELL CARD!

00:18:41.028 --> 00:18:42.963
THANKS TO THE EFFECT
OF MY FIELD BARRIER,

00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:44.865
YOU CAN'T COUNTER
MY COLISEUM,

00:18:45.466 --> 00:18:47.268
AND NO OTHER FIELD SPELL
CAN REPLACE THE ONE

00:18:47.902 --> 00:18:48.903
I ALREADY HAVE IN PLAY!

00:18:49.537 --> 00:18:52.573
THIS PIECE OF ANCIENT
ARCHITECTURE MIGHT JUST
TURN ME INTO HISTORY.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.777
NOW I'LL SUMMON OUT
MY REPTILE GORGON!

00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:02.850
Computer: REPTILE GORGON
IS A LEVEL THREE

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:05.152
DARK ATTRIBUTE
REPTILE TYPE MONSTER

00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:08.522
THAT HAS 1400 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS.

00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.224
AND I EQUIP IT
WITH THIS:

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:12.693
MY SPELL CALLED
ATTACK PHEROMONE.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.296
AND NOW, WHEN MY REPTILE
ATTACKS YOUR MONSTERS,

00:19:15.763 --> 00:19:17.565
THEY CAN'T SIMPLY HIDE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:19:18.232 --> 00:19:19.800
THIS CARD SWITCHES THEM
TO ATTACK MODE

00:19:20.134 --> 00:19:21.302
WHETHER YOU LIKE
IT OR NOT.

00:19:21.969 --> 00:19:23.404
NOW YOU KNOW
HOW IT FEELS TO BE

00:19:24.071 --> 00:19:25.105
IN A POWERLESS
SITUATION,

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.107
JUST LIKE I'VE BEEN
ALL THESE YEARS

00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:31.679
AS I STRUGGLED TO FIND
OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY BROTHER.

00:19:35.983 --> 00:19:38.385
AND THIS NEXT CARD
SHOULD HELP DRIVE
THAT SENTIMENT HOME!

00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:41.689
I CAST MOLTING ESCAPE
ON REPTILE GORGON!

00:19:42.356 --> 00:19:43.991
NOW MY MONSTER'S
PRACTICALLY INVINCIBLE!

00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:46.427
ONCE A TURN SHE CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE

00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:48.162
NO MATTER HOW STRONG
YOUR MONSTER IS!

00:19:48.796 --> 00:19:51.031
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT EVERY TIME I USE
THIS EQUIP EFFECT,

00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:54.802
REPTILE GORGON
GAINS AN EXTRA 100
ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:55.469 --> 00:19:57.271
NOW LET'S SEE HOW ALL
THESE SPELLS PLAY OUT.

00:19:57.938 --> 00:19:59.306
REPTILE GORGON, ATTACK!

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.842
HOLD ON!
I THINK THE DARK SIGNERS

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:04.078
LEFT YOU A COUPLE CARDS
SHORT OF A DECK!

00:20:04.678 --> 00:20:06.547
EVEN WITH ALL THOSE
EQUIP SPELLS YOU STILL DON'T

00:20:06.947 --> 00:20:10.084
HAVE A CHANCE
AGAINST MY BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:18.058
[GROANING]

00:20:22.329 --> 00:20:26.200
AND NOW, THANKS TO MY
MOLTING ESCAPE EQUIP
SPELL, GORGON LIVES!

00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:28.235
NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT SHE GETS THOSE

00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:30.537
EXTRA 100 ATTACK POINTS
I MENTIONED,

00:20:31.205 --> 00:20:33.507
EVENING
THE PLAYING FIELD JUST
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:20:34.141 --> 00:20:35.142
[THINKING]
I DON'T GET IT!

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:36.944
ALL THOSE SPELLS
AND COMBOS JUST TO ADD

00:20:37.444 --> 00:20:38.646
100 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:20:39.313 --> 00:20:40.447
WHAT'S HER REAL PLAN?

00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:42.116
THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.785
I HAVEN'T YET
TALKED ABOUT GORGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:45.185 --> 00:20:46.186
WHAT'S IT DO?!

00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:48.155
HUH?

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.295
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO MY DRAGON, MISTY?!

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.232
LET'S JUST SAY SHE'S
RESTING FOR NOW.

00:20:58.899 --> 00:21:00.234
YOU SEE GORGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:21:00.734 --> 00:21:01.935
FREEZES HER MODE,
I'M AFRAID.

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:03.871
SO SHE CAN'T DEFEND YOU
AND OR ATTACK

00:21:04.538 --> 00:21:06.373
SINCE ALL OF HER POWER
HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED.

00:21:07.007 --> 00:21:08.475
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

00:21:09.143 --> 00:21:11.345
YES I CAN.
AND I DID!

00:21:12.012 --> 00:21:15.449
NOW IF YOU'LL
EXCUSE ME FOR JUST
THIS ONE MOMENT,

00:21:16.116 --> 00:21:17.685
I'LL ENJOY MY FIELD
SPELL'S EFFECT:

00:21:18.352 --> 00:21:19.653
I GET 300 LIFE
POINTS BECAUSE

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.722
I ATTACKED YOU
THIS ROUND!

00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:23.390
YOU CAN
NEVER BEAT ME!

00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:25.259
BE SMART AND TALK:
TELL ME WHAT

00:21:25.926 --> 00:21:27.761
YOU KNOW ABOUT MY
ONLY BROTHER'S FATE!

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:31.432
AND I PROMISE I'LL
MAKE YOUR DEFEAT QUICK
AND PAINLESS.

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.167
SO WHAT'S YOUR DECISION?

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.370
I TOLD YOU ALREADY
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED!!!

00:21:37.037 --> 00:21:39.473
I SEE. THEN THAT
LEAVES ME NO CHOICE.

00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:41.442
YOU KNOW YOUR
DEAR FRIEND SAYER?

00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.244
I'M AFRAID HE'S
ABOUT TO LOSE
HIS SHADOW DUEL!

00:21:44.912 --> 00:21:45.913
SAYER?!

00:21:45.913 --> 00:21:47.781
AND SO ARE YOU
