00:18:50.008 --> 00:18:51.944
YOU DON'T NEED THEM, JACK.

00:18:51.944 --> 00:18:54.046
STOP IT! YOU'RE
JUST TRYING TO
WEDGE US APART,

00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:56.581
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:59.952
ALL I'M SAYING IS
THIS, ONCE UPON A TIME,
JACK ATLAS WAS

00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:02.087
A GREAT DUEL CHAMPION.

00:19:02.087 --> 00:19:04.022
AND THEN HE GOT CAUGHT
UP IN ALL THIS SILLY
FRIENDSHIP BUSINESS

00:19:04.022 --> 00:19:06.558
AND BECAME A BIG NOBODY.

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:08.560
COME, JACK. YOU KNOW
THAT I AM RIGHT--

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.797
THAT NOW YOU'RE
NOTHING MORE THAN
A SINGLE SPOKE

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:13.999
ON A BROKEN WHEEL
GOING NOWHERE,

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:16.468
A SHELL OF
THE DUEL MONSTERS
LEGEND YOU ONCE WERE.

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:20.839
BUT, JACK, IT'S NOT
TOO LATE, YOU KNOW.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:22.574
YOU STILL HAVE TIME

00:19:22.574 --> 00:19:24.676
TO BECOME THE MAN
YOU ONCE WERE,

00:19:24.676 --> 00:19:27.946
TO BE THE GREATEST
DUEL CHAMPION OF OUR
TIME OR ANY OTHER.

00:19:27.946 --> 00:19:32.050
AND ALL YOU NEED DO
IS TURN YOUR BACK ON
YOUR FRIENDS HERE AND NOW.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.886
Jack: HE'S RIGHT.
IT'S TIME I DUEL FOR ME.

00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:56.125
Jack: GOODWIN'S RIGHT.
IT'S TIME I DUEL FOR ME!

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.360
NO, JACK!

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.495
GO, RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:19:59.495 --> 00:20:01.931
ATTACK THAT
SUN DRAGON INTI!

00:20:01.931 --> 00:20:04.934
GO, SCORCHING
CRIMSON FLARE!

00:20:12.842 --> 00:20:14.343
I'M QUITE PROUD
OF YOU, JACK.

00:20:14.343 --> 00:20:16.145
YOU HAVE DONE IT.

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:17.446
YOU DUELED ONLY
FOR YOURSELF THERE,

00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:20.015
AND NOW YOU'LL
PAY THE PRICE!

00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:22.885
I ACTIVATE SUN DRAGON
INTI'S ABILITY.

00:20:22.885 --> 00:20:25.921
NOW, NOT ONLY IS YOUR
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
DESTROYED

00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:29.992
FOR TAKING DOWN INTI,
BUT YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO DRAGON ARCHFIEND'S

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:31.761
ATTACK POINTS, AS WELL!

00:20:31.761 --> 00:20:34.196
WHY'D YOU DO IT?
WE HAD HIM, JACK.

00:20:34.196 --> 00:20:36.265
AND NOW YOU HAVE
MOON DRAGON QUILLA

00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:38.834
BECAUSE HE RISES BACK UP
WHEN INTI IS DESTROYED.

00:20:40.803 --> 00:20:46.041
I PLACE ONE FACEDOWN
TO END MY TURN.

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:48.110
NOW, NOW. DON'T GET
SO DOWN ON YOURSELF.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.680
IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME
TO BRING YOU BACK
TO YOUR GLORY DAYS

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.315
OF YESTERYEAR.

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:55.718
TRUST ME, I,
OF ALL PEOPLE, KNOW.

00:20:55.718 --> 00:20:57.186
AFTER ALL, JACK,

00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:58.187
I HAD TO GO IT ALONE
FOR QUITE A LONG TIME

00:20:58.187 --> 00:21:00.756
TO GET WHERE I AM.

00:21:00.756 --> 00:21:03.859
I THINK I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.

00:21:03.859 --> 00:21:06.996
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE YOU.

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:08.864
BEING THE BEST, IT'S NICE,

00:21:08.864 --> 00:21:11.801
BUT NOT WHEN YOU
EXPERIENCE IT ALONE.

00:21:11.801 --> 00:21:13.769
WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS HAVING
PEOPLE TO SHARE

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:15.204
YOUR TRIUMPHS WITH.

00:21:15.204 --> 00:21:16.405
WOW, JACK.

00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:19.108
ALL THE PEOPLE
I'VE MET AND BECOME
FRIENDS WITH

00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:20.743
GETTING TO THIS POINT HAVE
TAUGHT ME THAT,

00:21:20.743 --> 00:21:25.114
ESPECIALLY ONE VERY
SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL.

00:21:26.882 --> 00:21:29.919
NOW, GOODWIN, I'LL PAY
THAT INDIVIDUAL BACK

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.155
AS WELL AS THE REST
OF MY FRIENDS BY GIVING UP

00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:35.191
MY LONER WAYS FOR GOOD.

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:38.093
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO AFTER ALL
THEY'VE DONE FOR ME.

00:21:40.129 --> 00:21:41.664
JACK.

00:21:41.664 --> 00:21:43.866
FROM HERE ON OUT,
I'M GOING TO RISK
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE

00:21:43.866 --> 00:21:47.470
AND EVERYTHING THAT
I AM TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT,

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.706
JUST LIKE SOMEONE
DID FOR ME ONCE.

00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:53.342
THIS ONE'S
FOR YOU, CARLY!

00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:55.311
GOODWIN, YOU AND YOUR
DREAMS OF WORLD CONQUEST

00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:57.980
ARE GOING TO BE STOPPED.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.381
YOU FOOL.

00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.184
YOUR SAPPY IDEALS CAN'T
WIN THIS CONTEST FOR YOU.

00:22:02.184 --> 00:22:03.352
JUST FACE IT.

00:22:03.352 --> 00:22:06.856
THE TRUST YOU PUT IN YOUR
FRIENDS IS ALL WASTED.

00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:08.357
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT

00:22:08.357 --> 00:22:10.092
BECAUSE NOW
IT'S MY TURN
TO DRAW, GOODWIN.

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:11.760
HERE I GO!

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.232
Yusei, thinking:
AND HERE'S HOPING I CAN
TURN THE TIDE OF THIS DUEL

00:22:16.232 --> 00:22:18.334
RIGHT NOW.

00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:21.070
Yusei: FIRST,
DUE TO JUNK ARCHER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.039
MOON QUILLA IS
REMOVED FROM PLAY.

00:22:24.039 --> 00:22:26.375
I THINK NOT.
I PLAY A TRAP--

00:22:26.375 --> 00:22:28.611
DESTRUCT POTION.

00:22:28.611 --> 00:22:31.747
NOW, BY DESTROYING
MY OWN MONSTER,
I GET TO GAIN LIFE POINTS

00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:33.415
EQUAL TO ITS
ATTACK POINTS.

00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:35.951
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:39.255
THE MONSTER I CHOSE
TO DESTROY IS
MOON DRAGON QUILLA.

00:22:39.255 --> 00:22:43.158
AND SINCE HE'S GONE,
SUN DRAGON
INTI RISES AGAIN!

00:22:43.158 --> 00:22:45.895
SO MUCH FOR THE GRAND
POWER OF FRIENDSHIP,
EH, YUSEI?

00:22:45.895 --> 00:22:49.265
ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D
CARE TO TRY THIS TURN?

00:22:49.265 --> 00:22:53.068
I'M DONE. YOUR MOVE.

00:22:53.068 --> 00:22:55.070
YOU PEONS, YOU FOOLS.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.907
YOU STRUGGLE, YOU FIGHT.
AND FOR WHAT?

00:22:57.907 --> 00:23:01.477
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
IT WILL ALL JUST
END THE SAME WAY.

00:23:01.477 --> 00:23:04.179
I WARNED YOU THAT
YOUR FATES WERE SEALED.

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:06.749
THEY ARE,

00:23:06.749 --> 00:23:09.985
JUST AS THE FATE
OF THE ENTIRE WORLD IS
SEALED, AS WELL.

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:12.421
ALL THAT YOU'VE SAID
AND DONE, IT MEANS NOTHING.

00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:14.390
DOOMSDAY IS
FINALLY HERE!

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.959
TIME HAS ALL BUT RUN OUT.

00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:18.928
THE SIGNERS HAVE FAILED!

00:23:18.928 --> 00:23:19.929
[GOODWIN CHUCKLING SINISTERLY]
