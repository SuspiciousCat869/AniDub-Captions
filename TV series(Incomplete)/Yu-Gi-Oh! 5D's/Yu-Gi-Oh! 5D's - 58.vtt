WEBVTT

00:00:02.065 --> 00:00:04.000
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED WITH
"YU-GI-OH 5D's!"

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.405
HEY, AKIZA,
YOU IN HERE?

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:13.009
IT'S JACK. AKIZA!

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:14.310
HUH?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.147
I KNOW THESE.

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:20.717
THEY LOOK LIKE... CARLY!

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.554
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:26.623
WHAT'S WITH
THIS DUEL DISK?

00:00:26.623 --> 00:00:29.025
WHAT'S THIS
MARK ON MY ARM?!

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.161
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:36.532
CARLY, DON'T BE
AFRAID OF YOUR DESTINY.

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:38.868
WHEN THE LIFE YOU ONCE
KNEW WAS TAKEN AWAY,

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:41.170
YOU HAD UNFINISHED
BUSINESS, SOMETHING YOU

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.306
NEEDED TO SAY OR DO.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.408
THE IMMORTALS GAVE YOU
THEIR POWER SO THAT YOU

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:48.945
COULD, WELL,
STICK AROUND.

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:50.546
THAT'S A LIE!

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.316
DON'T WORRY.

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:55.118
YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND SOON,

00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:58.655
BUT BEFORE YOU CAN DO THAT,
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:02.258
OUT WHAT IS YOUR
UNFINISHED BUSINESS?

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:06.296
AND HOW CAN IT BENEFIT
THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:08.264
Jack: HEY, YOU!

00:01:08.264 --> 00:01:09.265
YEAH, YOU.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:11.234
WHY YOU LOOK SO
FAMILIAR?

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:17.273
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:20.643
CARLY, IS THAT YOU?

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:21.678
YES.

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:23.112
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:26.382
YOU CAN'T REALLY BE
A DARK SIGNER.

00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:28.418
IF IT'S ANSWERS THAT
YOU WANT, YOU'LL HAVE TO

00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:30.820
COME FIND ME TOMORROW.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.323
TILL THEN, JACK.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:36.125
[THINKING]
I'M COMING TO HELP YOU, CARLY.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.328
'CAUSE WHEN I WAS HURT,
YOU TOOK CARE OF ME,

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.264
AND WHEN I WAS DOWN,
YOU PICKED ME UP.

00:01:41.264 --> 00:01:45.234
NOW IT'S MY CHANCE
TO RETURN THE FAVOR.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:47.370
YOU CAN BRING THAT
BEAST BACK AGAIN?

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.005
THAT'S RIGHT, ROMAN,
AND NOW HE'S GOING

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.541
TO ATTACK WITH
COSMIC FLARE!

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:01.084
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S
OVER, DON'T YOU?

00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:04.487
WELL UNLESS YOU SEAL
ALL THE TOWERS BY SUNSET,

00:02:04.487 --> 00:02:08.324
THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD
WILL RESURRECT!

00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:12.528

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.286
I'M ALRIGHT,
WE'RE ALL ALRIGHT.

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:44.854

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:46.422

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:50.093
OH DEAR.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:01.304
[THINKING]
DON'T YOU WORRY, CARLY,

00:04:01.304 --> 00:04:03.039

00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:07.477

WELL, WELL.

00:04:15.852 --> 00:04:17.820
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.589
YES, THIS MUST BE IT.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.157
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN HIDING

00:04:21.157 --> 00:04:24.260
AND WHERE I'LL
SAVE YOU, CARLY.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.696
AAH!

00:04:26.696 --> 00:04:28.264
HUH?!

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:30.967
OHH.

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:33.669
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
BECAME A DARK SIGNER,

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.738
BUT IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT,

00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:38.040
YOU WON'T BE
ONE FOR LONG.

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:47.717
CARLY, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN THERE!

00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:49.552
I'VE COME HERE
TO HELP YOU!

00:04:49.552 --> 00:04:51.320
IF ONLY YOU'LL
LET ME.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.655
CARLY!

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:58.461
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:03.633
BUT IT IS.

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:22.118
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, JACKIE!

00:05:22.118 --> 00:05:24.654
CARLY, WHO DID
THIS TO YOU?

00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:25.755
TELL ME!

00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:27.123
WHO, JACK?

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:29.859
YOU MUST BE JOKING... THE
ANSWER IS SO OBVIOUS...

00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:31.727
YOU ARE THE ONE
RESPONSIBLE!

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:33.129
NO, YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.264
I'M THE ONE WHO'S
TRYING TO SAVE YOU!

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:37.400
PLEASE, IN THE END YOU
CHOSE TO CUT ME OFF

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.668
BECAUSE YOU
THOUGHT I WAS ONE

00:05:38.668 --> 00:05:40.436
OF THE PAPARAZZI.

00:05:40.436 --> 00:05:41.971
PAPARAZZI?

00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:43.573
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:44.707
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

00:05:44.707 --> 00:05:46.576
OH YES IT IS,
IF ONLY YOU HAD BEEN

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:48.578
A LITTLE NICER, JACKIE.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:50.813
DON'T YOU SEE,
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:53.015
THAT'S WHY I
ALWAYS KEPT YOU
AT A DISTANCE.

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:54.116
CARLY.

00:05:54.116 --> 00:05:55.618
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET INVOLVED...

00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:57.253
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET HURT!

00:05:57.253 --> 00:05:58.854
WELL, YOU FAILED.

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:02.425
AND NOW, IT'S MY TURN
TO EVEN THE SCORE!

00:06:16.755 --> 00:06:17.756
FACE IT, JACKIE,
I'M A DARK SIGNER

00:06:17.756 --> 00:06:18.790
BECAUSE OF YOU!

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.825
WRONG, CARLY!

00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:21.259
BUT IT WILL BE
BECAUSE OF ME

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.727
THAT YOU'RE RID OF
THIS DARK SCOURGE.

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:25.864
I WILL DO WHATEVER
I MUST TO RELEASE
YOU OF IT!

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:27.232
REALLY?

00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:28.466
WELL, I'M AFRAID
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

00:06:28.466 --> 00:06:30.235
TO DO THAT, JACKIE.

00:06:30.235 --> 00:06:31.970
AND IN CASE YOU'RE
IN THE DARK AS TO WHAT

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.908
WAY THAT IS, ALLOW ME
TO ENLIGHTEN YOU.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.753
THE STAGE IS SET.

00:06:48.753 --> 00:06:52.524
AND NOW, ONLY ONE
THING REMAINS... WE DUEL.

00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:53.558
BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU,

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:55.594
THIS GOES BOTH WAYS.

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:59.030
YOU WIN, I RETURN
TO HOW I WAS.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.266
HOWEVER, SHOULD I WIN,
YOU BECOME

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:03.001
A DARK SIGNER LIKE ME!

00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:04.970
SO? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.005
I SAY, BRING IT!

00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:11.276
CHECK IT OUT!

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:13.712
SOMEONE'S DUELING.

00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:15.580
MUST BE JACK!

00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:18.483
I'M SO PLEASED
YOU ACCEPTED

00:07:18.483 --> 00:07:20.518
MY CHALLENGE, JACKIE.

00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:22.754
A BIG SHOT PRO
DUELIST LIKE YOU FACING

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:24.589
AN AMATEUR LIKE ME?

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:26.725
FOR A MINUTE THERE
I WAS AFRAID FACING ME

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:28.526
WOULD BE BENEATH YOU.

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:29.961
WHO SAYS IT'S NOT?

00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.396
AH, THAT'S THE JACK
I KNOW,

00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:33.298
ARROGANT
UNTIL THE VERY END.

00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:35.000
AND THIS WILL
BE YOUR END.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.469
NOW THEN, ALLOW ME TO
GET THINGS STARTED.

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:40.272
I ACTIVATE THE SPEED WORLD
FIELD SPELL!

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:42.707
MY, MY, AREN'T YOU
IN A HURRY TO LOSE!

00:07:42.707 --> 00:07:46.411
VERY WELL.
LET'S DO THIS!

00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:48.013
AH, THE IRONY.

00:07:48.013 --> 00:07:50.015
BEFORE I WAS CHASING
AFTER YOU AND HANGING

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:52.484
OFF YOUR EVERY WORD
BUT NOW THINGS HAVE

00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:54.052
GONE FULL CIRCLE.

00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:56.288
NOW, YOU'RE
THE DESPERATE ONE.

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:57.255
THAT'S RIGHT,
DESPERATE TO GET

00:07:57.255 --> 00:07:58.924
THE OLD CARLY BACK.

00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:00.892
AND THERE'S NO WAY
I'LL BE DENIED!

00:08:00.892 --> 00:08:02.560
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:08:03.728 --> 00:08:05.897
WHOEVER'S FIRST TO TURN
THE CORNER COMING UP

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:08.400
GETS TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.535
[THINKING]
IF THAT'S HOW YOU
WANT TO PLAY IT, FINE.

00:08:10.535 --> 00:08:13.438
TIME TO TAKE THIS
INTO OVERDRIVE!

00:08:18.476 --> 00:08:20.312
AAH!

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:21.546
HA HA HA!

00:08:21.546 --> 00:08:23.081
PROBLEM?

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:28.053
LOOKS LIKE
THE HONOR'S MINE.

00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:29.654
HERE GOES!

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:32.590
FIRST I'LL SUMMON
FORTUNE LADY LIGHT!

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:38.630
Computer: FORTUNE LADY LIGHT'S
LEVEL INCREASES VERY TURN,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.799
AND ITS ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS ARE EQUAL

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.568
TO ITS LEVEL
MULTIPLIED BY 200.

00:08:43.568 --> 00:08:47.138
SO, JACKIE BOY, IT LOOKS
LIKE THE FIRST MOVE
HAS BEEN MADE.

00:08:47.138 --> 00:08:50.408
TIME TO SEE WHAT MY DECK'S
GOT PLANNED FOR YOU NEXT.

00:08:51.743 --> 00:08:53.244
[THINKING]
THIS CARD?

00:08:56.147 --> 00:08:58.483
HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING
TO KEEP ME ALL ALONE

00:08:58.483 --> 00:09:01.119
AND LOCKED UP
IN THIS ROOM?

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:04.089
WHAT IS IT THAT
THEY WANT WITH ME?

00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:08.126
Roman: SINCE YOU ASKED,
I WILL TELL YOU...

00:09:08.126 --> 00:09:11.062
THE ANSWER IS
IN THE CARDS.

00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:12.430
THE CARDS?

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.166
SWEET, INNOCENT
CARLY.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:18.203
YOU NEED ONLY BUT LOOK
AND YOU WILL SEE

00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:20.071
WHAT I SPEAK OF.

00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:25.043
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:37.188
HA HA HA!

00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:39.424
FINALLY, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:40.859
THAT'S IT FOR MY TURN.

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:44.562
NOW SHOW ME WHAT
YOU GOT, JACKIE!

00:09:44.562 --> 00:09:46.598
WITH PLEASURE!

00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:51.503
I THINK THAT'LL
DO FOR NOW.

00:09:51.503 --> 00:09:52.737
THAT'LL DO?

00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:54.039
BUT YOU DIDN'T SUMMON
A MONSTER OR EVEN

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.340
PLACE A FACEDOWN!

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.674
OH, WAIT.

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:59.077
I GET IT... YOU'RE STILL
RACKED WITH GUILT,

00:09:59.077 --> 00:10:00.912
AREN'T YOU, JACKIE?

00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:02.714
FOR WHAT YOU DID,
FOR HOW YOU GAVE ME

00:10:02.714 --> 00:10:05.784
THE COLD SHOULDER WHEN
I NEEDED YOU THE MOST.

00:10:05.784 --> 00:10:07.085
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:08.853
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:10:08.853 --> 00:10:10.488
JUST BECAUSE YOU WON'T
ATTACK ME, DOESN'T MEAN

00:10:10.488 --> 00:10:12.157
THAT I WON'T ATTACK YOU!

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.059
AND NOW I'LL SACRIFICE
FORTUNE LADY LIGHT

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:15.460
TO BRING OUT A PAIR
OF MONSTERS

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.729
THAT'LL DO JUST THAT!

00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:22.067
YOU SEE, WHEN LADY
LIGHT LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:10:22.067 --> 00:10:23.601
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
ANY MONSTERS

00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:25.904
FROM MY DECK JUST SO LONG
AS THEY HAVE FORTUNE LADY

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:27.439
IN THEIR NAME.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:29.641
SO COME ON
OUT, FORTUNE LADY EARTH

00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:31.543
AND FORTUNE LADY DARK!

00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:32.610
IN CASE YOU WERE
WONDERING... THEIR

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.312
ATTACK POINTS ARE EQUAL
TO THEIR LEVELS

00:10:34.312 --> 00:10:35.914
MULTIPLIED BY 400!

00:10:35.914 --> 00:10:37.882
AND SINCE EARTH'S LEVEL
IS SIX AND DARK'S LEVEL

00:10:37.882 --> 00:10:40.018
IS FIVE THAT MEANS THEIR
ATTACK POINTS ARE,

00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:41.886
WELL, YOU DO THE MATH.

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:43.822
2400 AND 2000?

00:10:43.822 --> 00:10:45.557
BUT THAT MEANS IF
I TAKE A DIRECT HIT

00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:48.026
FROM BOTH OF THEM, MY
LIFE POINTS WILL BE...

00:10:48.026 --> 00:10:50.428
HEH HEH. QUITE DIMINISHED.

00:10:50.428 --> 00:10:52.664
TOO BAD FOR YOU!

00:10:52.664 --> 00:10:54.532
THIS IS GONNA HURT.

00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:55.967
OH, I'M COUNTING ON IT!

00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:57.569
LET HIM HAVE IT!

00:10:57.569 --> 00:11:00.371
GO CURSED THORN!

00:11:03.308 --> 00:11:05.477
[GROANING]

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:13.151
BUT THE FUN'S
NOT OVER YET.

00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:14.586
ROUND TWO!

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:16.955
GO GET HIM, LADY DARK!

00:11:18.923 --> 00:11:20.859
DO WHAT YOU WILL.

00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:28.666
THERE YOU GO,
ALL BANDAGED UP!

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:31.503
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:33.905
BUT I BELIEVE IN MY
HEART THE CARLY I KNOW

00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:37.142
IS STILL SOMEWHERE
DEEP INSIDE YOU!

00:11:37.142 --> 00:11:38.843
AND I'M GOING TO DO
WHATEVER I MUST TO FIND

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:42.580
HER, BRING HER BACK OUT,
AND DO AWAY WITH YOU!

00:11:44.549 --> 00:11:49.320
SO I'LL START BY
SUMMONING CRYING OGRE!

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.723
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
CRYING OGRE'S

00:11:51.723 --> 00:11:53.725
ATTACK POINTS ARE EQUAL
TO THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE

00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:55.727
I TOOK FROM
THAT LAST ATTACK.

00:11:55.727 --> 00:11:57.762
AND SINCE YOU ATTACKED
ME TWICE, HE GETS TO

00:11:57.762 --> 00:11:59.731
AUTOMATICALLY BATTLE
THE SECOND MONSTER

00:11:59.731 --> 00:12:02.300
THAT STRUCK ME...
SO GO TO IT!

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.302
[ROARS]

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.508
WELL, WELL, JACKIE.

00:12:10.508 --> 00:12:11.910
GUESS YOU'RE GOING TO
BE PUTTING UP A FIGHT

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.345
AFTER ALL, EH?

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:16.247
IN THAT CASE, I THINK
I PLAY THIS FACEDOWN

00:12:16.247 --> 00:12:17.649
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:19.851
YOU KNOW, IT'S
BEST THIS WAY.

00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:22.020
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH, IT WOULD BE

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.588
SUCH A SHAME TO TAKE
YOU DOWN WITHOUT

00:12:23.588 --> 00:12:25.056
SOME RESISTANCE.

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:26.791
THIS WAY I CAN
REALLY SAVOR WATCHING

00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:27.959
YOU SQUIRM.

00:12:27.959 --> 00:12:29.861
AND BELIEVE ME, WITH
WHAT I HAVE PLANNED,

00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:32.764
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
SQUIRM BIG TIME!

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:51.155
[THINKING]
JACK ATLAS MAY BE ONE
OF THE BEST DUELISTS

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:53.524
IN THE WORLD,
BUT IF HE REALLY IS

00:12:53.524 --> 00:12:56.127
FACING A DARK SIGNER
THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.

00:12:56.127 --> 00:12:58.696
DARK SIGNERS PLAY
BY A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET

00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:02.266
OF RULES,
AND THEY PLAY FOR KEEPS.

00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:04.702
I HOPE JACK KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:13:04.736 --> 00:13:06.371
OF COURSE HE KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:09.507
AS LONG AS HE PLAYS
HIS GAME HE'LL COME
OUT ON TOP.

00:13:09.507 --> 00:13:12.377
[THINKING]
I JUST HOPE HE
CAN STAY FOCUSED.

00:13:14.112 --> 00:13:16.347
CARLY!

00:13:16.347 --> 00:13:20.518
AFTER ALL, I KNOW
HE'S HAD A LOT
ON HIS MIND LATELY.

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:27.125
ALRIGHT,
IT'S MY TURN!

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.662
[THINKING]
CRYING OGRE
AND FORTUNE LADY EARTH

00:13:31.662 --> 00:13:33.398
HAVE THE SAME NUMBER
OF ATTACK POINTS,

00:13:33.398 --> 00:13:34.599
WHICH MEANS
IF THEY BATTLE,

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:36.501
THEY'LL ONLY
DESTROY EACH OTHER.

00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.070
BUT THAT'S
ABOUT TO CHANGE!

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.407
I SUMMON POWER SUPPLIER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:44.842
DUE TO POWER SUPPLIER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:13:44.842 --> 00:13:48.012
CRYING OGRE GAINS 400
ATTACK POINTS!

00:13:48.012 --> 00:13:49.580
NOT SO FAST, JACKIE.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.315
I PLAY A TRAP!

00:13:51.315 --> 00:13:53.317
IT'S CALLED BENDING DESTINY,
AND IT RETURNS

00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:55.153
POWER SUPPLIER
TO YOUR HAND!

00:13:55.153 --> 00:13:56.554
NO WAY!

00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:58.056
YES, AND I'M
AFRAID THERE'S MORE.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:00.691
IT NEGATES SUPPLIER'S
EFFECT, AS WELL!

00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.327
[THINKING]
NOT GOOD... NOW NOT ONLY
WILL CRYING OGRE BE

00:14:03.327 --> 00:14:05.963
USELESS FOR THIS TURN,
NEXT TURN, WHEN CARLY'S

00:14:05.963 --> 00:14:08.533
FORTUNE LADY EARTH'S
ATTACK POINTS INCREASE,

00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.435
HE'LL BE A SITTING DUCK
FOR HER... AND HE'LL

00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:13.704
NO DOUBT SHED SOME REAL
TEARS AFTER HER ASSAULT.

00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:15.706
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:19.610
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.345
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:22.747
ANOTHER LAME MOVE.

00:14:22.747 --> 00:14:24.649
I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE.

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:26.918
HERE, LET ME SHOW
YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:28.619
I HOPE YOU'RE READY!

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:30.822
HYAH!

00:14:30.822 --> 00:14:32.657
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
NO ONE COULD BE READY

00:14:32.657 --> 00:14:34.192
FOR WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO PLAY!

00:14:34.192 --> 00:14:36.260
QUIT YOUR YAPPING
AND DUEL!

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.299
HMM. ALRIGHT, IF YOU INSIST,
BUT YOU ASKED FOR IT.

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:44.836
FIRST THINGS FIRST,
FORTUNE LADY'S
LEVEL INCREASES!

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:46.537
AND WHEN HER LEVEL
INCREASES, SO DO HER

00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:49.407
ATTACK POINTS... TO 2800!

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:54.479
AND DID I MENTION
FORTUNE LADY'S
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:56.781
OH, WAIT, I FORGOT...
YOU'RE SICK OF MY YAPPING

00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:58.082
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LOOK DOWN

00:14:58.082 --> 00:14:59.984
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS
AND SEE FOR YOURSELF...

00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:03.087
BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT TO
BE 400 LESS OF THEM!

00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:05.523
AAH! AAH!

00:15:05.523 --> 00:15:08.059
AND NOW TO DEAL
WITH THAT OGRE!

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:10.461
GO, CURSED THORN!

00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:13.931
[GROANING]

00:15:21.105 --> 00:15:24.242
HA HA HA!

00:15:24.242 --> 00:15:26.177
THAT'S RIGHT,
LAUGH...

00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:27.445
WHILE YOU CAN.

00:15:27.445 --> 00:15:30.081
OH, DON'T TELL ME,
JACKIE, YOU'VE ALREADY

00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:32.917
LOST YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR...
WE'VE JUST BEGUN.

00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:35.086
INDEED WE HAVE
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:36.787
THERE'S A LONG
WAY TO GO!

00:15:36.787 --> 00:15:39.023
AND IT'S GOING TO BE
ROUGH GOING FOR YOU!

00:15:39.023 --> 00:15:40.892
YOU STILL DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

00:15:40.892 --> 00:15:43.327
THE QUESTION OF WHO WINS
AND WHO LOSES THIS DUEL

00:15:43.327 --> 00:15:45.663
HAS ALREADY BEEN
ANSWERED BY THE CARDS

00:15:45.663 --> 00:15:48.065
JUST AS THE QUESTION OF
WHY I WAS CHOSEN TO BE

00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:51.002
A DARK SIGNER WAS
ANSWERED BY THE CARDS.

00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:54.205
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

00:15:54.205 --> 00:15:57.775
THE CARDS WILL SPEAK
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:15:59.277 --> 00:16:00.578
YOU'VE GONE DAFT.

00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:01.846
DON'T BELIEVE ME?

00:16:01.846 --> 00:16:03.981
HERE TAKE A LOOK.

00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:06.484
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:17.528
Leo: OOH, YUSEI,
HE'S, HE'S...

00:16:17.528 --> 00:16:18.996
HE'S GONE.

00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:20.364
YUSEI!

00:16:20.364 --> 00:16:21.832
NO!

00:16:21.832 --> 00:16:24.101
YUSEI'S JUST
GOTTA BE ALRIGHT!

00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:25.503
AND HE IS!

00:16:25.503 --> 00:16:27.838
YUSEI'S A SURVIVOR,
THAT MUCH WE KNOW!

00:16:27.838 --> 00:16:29.707
OF COURSE WHAT WE
DON'T KNOW IS WHERE

00:16:29.707 --> 00:16:32.743
THIS GLOWING LAKE
OF LIGHT TOOK HIM.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.292
WHERE IN THE WORLD?

00:16:48.292 --> 00:16:50.294
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:54.699
WELL, I'M STILL
IN ONE PIECE.

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:56.867
[MOANING]

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.572
WHERE ARE ALL THOSE
THINGS COMING FROM?

00:17:01.572 --> 00:17:02.807
AAH!

00:17:04.508 --> 00:17:06.911
AAH! LET GO OF ME!

00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:09.413
BEAT IT!

00:17:09.413 --> 00:17:10.414
STAY BACK!

00:17:10.414 --> 00:17:12.083
STAY BACK!!!

00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:27.531
WAIT A SEC.

00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.267
COULD THESE BE
THE SPIRITS OF THE PEOPLE

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:31.936
WHO DISAPPEARED WHEN
THE ORIGINAL ENER-D REACTOR

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:33.571
HAD ITS MELT DOWN?

00:17:33.571 --> 00:17:35.840
WELL, IF THEY ARE,
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.709
VERY BIG FANS OF ME,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:46.150
AAH! HELP!!!

00:17:48.953 --> 00:17:50.354
YOO-HOO.

00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:53.591
WAKEY, WAKEY,
JACKIE, JACKIE.

00:17:53.591 --> 00:17:55.793
DON'T WORRY IF YOU
FEEL A BIT GROGGY.

00:17:55.793 --> 00:17:58.796
I KNOW I DID AFTER.

00:17:58.796 --> 00:18:01.599
WHAT?
AFTER WHAT?

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:04.635
AFTER I BECAME
A DARK SIGNER, OF COURSE.

00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:07.071
NO, NO.
THIS CAN'T BE.

00:18:07.071 --> 00:18:08.339
BUT IT IS.

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:10.441
I WELCOME YOU TO
THE SHADOWS, JACKIE.

00:18:10.441 --> 00:18:12.877
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO ME?

00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:16.514
MY EYES, THEY'RE...

00:18:16.514 --> 00:18:19.250
THEY'RE AS BLACK
AS THE NIGHT.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.252
AN IMPROVEMENT,
I'D SAY.

00:18:21.252 --> 00:18:25.222
I DID TRY TO WARN YOU,
OR DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:18:25.222 --> 00:18:26.991
ONCE I ATTACKED WITH
FORTUNE LADY EARTH,

00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:28.826
IT WAS ALL OVER.

00:18:41.072 --> 00:18:42.940
THE MYSTICAL POWER
OF THE DARK SIGNERS

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.942
HAD INFECTED YOU.

00:18:44.942 --> 00:18:47.778
YOU'RE ONE OF US NOW.

00:19:02.753 --> 00:19:04.455
YOUR TRANSFORMATION
IS COMPLETE NOW, JACK.

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.457
AND SO IS THE WORLD'S.

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:09.894
HOW DOES ME BECOMING
A DARK SIGNER AFFECT
THE WORLD?

00:19:09.894 --> 00:19:11.596
IN EVERY WAY
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:19:11.596 --> 00:19:13.231
YOUR ALLEGIANCE
TO THE SHADOWS HAS SHIFTED

00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:14.665
THE BALANCE OF NATURE.

00:19:14.665 --> 00:19:18.169
NOW THE OCEANS BOIL
AND THE SKIES ARE
FOREVER DARK.

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:20.571
DEAR ME.
IT'S... IT'S...

00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:21.806
BEAUTIFUL.

00:19:21.806 --> 00:19:23.441
OF COURSE, THE SIGNERS
MIGHT DISAGREE BUT SINCE

00:19:23.441 --> 00:19:25.209
THEY CAN ONLY CHALLENGE
OUR REIGN ONCE EVERY

00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:27.879
FIVE THOUSAND YEARS,
THEY'LL JUST HAVE TO
DEAL WITH IT.

00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:30.581
OR PAY THE PRICE
LIKE THEIR MONSTERS
ALREADY HAVE.

00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:33.117
AND IT'S A STEEP
PRICE INDEED.

00:19:52.603 --> 00:19:56.374
HA HA HA!

00:19:56.374 --> 00:19:58.442
YES, I THINK IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME.

00:19:58.442 --> 00:20:00.411
ALL THE DESTRUCTION,
ALL THE DEVASTATION,

00:20:00.411 --> 00:20:03.447
ALL PAVING THE WAY
TO THIS DELIGHTFUL
NEW PARADISE.

00:20:03.447 --> 00:20:04.916
PARADISE, INDEED,
BECAUSE IN THIS

00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:08.085
NEW WORLD YOU ARE
THE SUPREME RULER...
THE DARK KING,

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:10.454
ALL THAT YOU SEE
BEFORE YOU IS YOURS!

00:20:10.488 --> 00:20:13.124
AS IT SHOULD BE.

00:20:13.124 --> 00:20:16.027
WHAT A FOOL I WAS BEFORE
AS MY FORMER SELF.

00:20:16.027 --> 00:20:20.131
COUNTING ON FRIENDS,
FIGHTING FOR WHAT IS
GOOD... WHAT A JOKE!

00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:21.599
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:25.670
THIS IS WHAT DESTINY HAD
PLANNED FOR JACK ATLAS!

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.004
HOW RIGHT YOU ARE.

00:20:27.004 --> 00:20:29.006
AND IT WAS IN THE CARDS
THE WHOLE TIME

00:20:29.006 --> 00:20:31.108
LIKE I ALWAYS SAID.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.414
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
IN ONE CARD TO BE EXACT.

00:20:36.414 --> 00:20:38.015
ENLIGHTENMENT.

00:20:38.015 --> 00:20:43.154
IT CHANGED EVERYTHING,
REMEMBER?

00:20:43.154 --> 00:20:45.189
THAT'S RIGHT, JACK,
THIS WAS THE SAME CARD

00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:47.825
THAT MADE ME REALIZE
WHY, WHY I WAS CHOSEN

00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:50.661
TO BECOME ONE
OF THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:20:50.661 --> 00:20:52.697
AND THE REASON WAS SO
I COULD FACE YOU

00:20:52.697 --> 00:20:55.700
IN A DUEL, FACE YOU
AND DEFEAT YOU SO THAT

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.768
YOU COULD BECOME WHAT
YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE...

00:20:57.768 --> 00:20:59.470
THE DARK KING!

00:20:59.503 --> 00:21:01.739
AND HOW FITTING IT IS
THAT THIS IS THE CARD

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:03.040
I DO WITH IT!

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.309
WHEN ACTIVATED IT
ALLOWS THE MONSTER THAT

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:08.112
DESTROYED YOUR MONSTER
TO ATTACK A SECOND TIME!

00:21:08.112 --> 00:21:09.313
IT'S OVER, JACK.

00:21:09.313 --> 00:21:10.615
YOU'VE LOST THE DUEL.

00:21:10.615 --> 00:21:12.250
DESTINY HAS
BEEN FULFILLED!

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.052
MY DESTINY...
FULFILLED.

00:21:23.527 --> 00:21:26.631
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE PAST,
IT'S ALL ANCIENT HISTORY NOW

00:21:26.631 --> 00:21:28.466
AND AS YOU CAN SEE
ALL TRACES

00:21:28.466 --> 00:21:31.402
OF THAT WRETCHED
TIME ARE NO MORE.

00:21:31.402 --> 00:21:33.471
INDEED. STRUCK
FROM THE EARTH

00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:36.040
AS SOON
AS OUR DUEL ENDED.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.441
HUH?

00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:39.744
WAIT, THOSE ARE
CARLY'S.

00:21:39.744 --> 00:21:41.779
BUT HOW, UNLESS...

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:42.847
WE'RE STILL
IN THE PRESENT

00:21:42.847 --> 00:21:46.017
AND THIS HAS ALL
BEEN ONE BIG TRICK.

00:21:46.017 --> 00:21:47.351
MEANING OUR DUEL
ISN'T OVER YET!

00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:49.120
MEANING I CAN
PLAY THIS...

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.788
CHANGING DESTINY!

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:53.924
THIS TRAP CARD NEGATES
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK!

00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:57.895
NO, WAIT.

00:21:57.895 --> 00:22:00.931
SURE, MAYBE THAT WAS ALL
AN ILLUSION BUT, JACK,

00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:02.767
IT COULD BE A REALITY.

00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:04.602
DON'T YOU SEE, THAT'S
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS

00:22:04.602 --> 00:22:09.240
FOR YOU IF YOU GIVE
INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.042
I'M NOT GIVING ANYTHING
TO THE DARKNESS,

00:22:11.042 --> 00:22:12.843
IN FACT, I'M TAKING
SOMETHING BACK.

00:22:12.843 --> 00:22:15.980
CARLY, THE REAL CARLY,
YOU GOT THAT?

00:22:18.783 --> 00:22:20.785
SO GET READY!

[SPIRITS MOANING]

00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:29.427
AAH! AAH! AAH!

00:22:31.629 --> 00:22:36.200
STAND DOWN, OH,
LOST SPIRITS
OF THE NETHERWORLD.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.036
IT IS NOT YET
THIS ONE'S TIME.

00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:49.213
YUSEI, THERE IS STILL
MUCH FOR YOU TO DO BACK

00:22:49.213 --> 00:22:51.649
IN THE SATELLITE SECTOR.

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:53.851
HEY, WHO ARE YOU?

00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:56.587
SOMEONE NOT TO
BE QUESTIONED.
