00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:18.085
THIS BE THE POWER
OF MY BLACK GARDEN.

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:20.187
AS LONG AS
WE'RE INSIDE
THIS GREENHOUSE,

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:22.857
YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS
ARE CUT IN HALF

00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.826
AND A ROSE TOKEN
BLOSSOMS
ON MY FIELD.

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.596
I'M SURE A KNIGHT
LIKE YOU CAN HANDLE
A FEW THORNS.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:30.731
WATCH HER BEAUTY
BLOOM.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:32.600
AND BE SURE THAT
YOU TAKE IN

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:35.035
THE SWEET SMELL OF
MY SUCCESS.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:36.871
HEH HEH.

00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.906
Announcer: WITH MASKED
KNIGHT'S ATTACK
POINTS SLICED IN HALF,

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:42.777
SIR RANDSBORG CAN'T GET
CLOSE TO THE BLACK ROSE.

00:10:42.777 --> 00:10:43.811
Gil, thinking:
MINE POINTS ATTACKETH
MATTER NOT!

00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:46.413
THINE MONSTERS SHALL
STILL FALL

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.916
TO THY KNIGHT'S ABILITY
MOST SPECIAL.

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:51.152
VENGEANCE IS MINE!

00:10:54.722 --> 00:10:55.990
YOU YIELD?

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.026
NOT WITH
MY DOPPELGANGER
TRAP CARD IN PLAY.

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:01.195
Computer: WITH THE TRAP CARD
DOPPELGANGER,

00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:04.165
WHEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE FROM
THE SPECIAL ABILITY OF
YOUR OPPONENT'S MONSTER,

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:07.101
YOUR OPPONENT TAKES
THE SAME AMOUNT OF DAMAGE.

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:09.637
TAKE THAT,
YOU BIG TIN CAN!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:14.074
OH, NO!

00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:15.576
IT LOOKS LIKE
SIR RANDSBORG
TOOK HIS FIRST HIT,

00:11:15.576 --> 00:11:18.612
AND IT IS A MAJOR ONE.

00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:20.047
HIS FACE!

00:11:20.047 --> 00:11:21.582
SHE GAVE HIM
A SCAR!

00:11:21.582 --> 00:11:23.751
I GUESS HER POWERS
ARE REAL!

00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.619
EH, LET'S GO HOME.

00:11:25.653 --> 00:11:27.087
IF SHE CAN DO THAT TO HIM,

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:28.622
WHAT'LL SHE DO TO US?

00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:30.424
'TIS BUT A MERE
SCRATCH.

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:33.661
HER POWERS SCARE NOT
THIS BRAVE WARRIOR.

00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:36.997
BUT 'ERE WITCH
SHALL PAY!

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:39.166
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU
CALL A WITCH.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.702
A THREAT?

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:43.704
YOU SHALL PAY DEARLY
FOR THAT!

00:11:43.704 --> 00:11:45.773
I CASTETH TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN.

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:47.141
THINE TURN.

00:11:47.141 --> 00:11:48.809
I KNOW.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:51.011
AND FOR STARTERS,
I'LL PLAY MY SPELL
MARK OF THE ROSE,

00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:53.948
WHICH LETS ME
SELECT ONE
OF THE MONSTERS

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:56.183
ON YOUR SIDE OF
THE FIELD AND TAKE
CONTROL OF IT.

00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:58.819
MASKED KNIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT JOINING ME?

00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:09.196
HA HA HA.

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.598
OH, MY!

00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:12.266
HE APPEARS TO BE QUITE
SMITTEN WITH HER.

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.603
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOUR MONSTER

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:18.138
HAS SWORN HIS
ALLEGIANCE TO ME.

00:12:18.138 --> 00:12:20.341
I THINK
IT'S TIME TO LET
SIR RANDSBORG FEEL

00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:22.843
THE STING
OF YOUR BETRAYAL.

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:23.844
AAH!

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:36.023
THOU BEWITCHED THE HEART
OF MY NOBLE KNIGHT!

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:38.092
THOU SHALL SUFFER
FOR SUCH INSOLENCE!

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.229
NOT BEFORE THIS.

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.430
I EQUIP
THE SPELL
VENGEFUL SERVANT

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.965
ON MY NEW
MASKED KNIGHT!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.670
SO NOW WHEN
HE GOES BACK
TO YOUR CONTROL

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.939
AT THE END
OF MY TURN,

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.841
YOU LOSE
EVEN MORE
LIFE POINTS...

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.609
ONE FOR
EACH OF HIS
ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:55.643 --> 00:12:57.011
YOU DARE NOT!

00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:59.413
OH, NO, I DO DARE!

00:12:59.413 --> 00:13:02.049
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
THE END OF MY TURN!

00:13:02.049 --> 00:13:04.718
MASKED KNIGHT,
WHY DON'T YOU GO
ON HOME?

00:13:04.718 --> 00:13:06.720
AND UNLEASH
THE TRUE POWER OF
MY VENGEFUL SERVANT?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.923
NOW STRIKE DOWN
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:13:08.923 --> 00:13:10.557
[GIL SCREAMING]

00:13:16.563 --> 00:13:18.332
THIS ROSE HAS THORNS!

00:13:18.332 --> 00:13:20.935
IN JUST ONE ROUND,
SHE'S PULLED UP THE ROOTS
OF RANDSBORG'S LEAD

00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:22.903
LIKE IT WAS A WEED
INFESTATION!

00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.039
THINE GIRL SHALL
SUFFER MY WRATH

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:29.843
WITH THIS, MINE TRAP
CARD... THY LEVEL CHANGE!

00:13:29.843 --> 00:13:32.680
THINE TURN HATH
NOT FINISHED AS
OF YET, BLACK ROSE!

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.282
MINE TRAITOROUS
MASKED KNIGHT,
LEVEL THE THIRD,

00:13:35.282 --> 00:13:37.751
SHALL BE SACRIFICED
TO THE YARD OF GRAVES

00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:41.722
SO THAT A FAR NOBLER
WARRIOR MAY
TAKE THINE PLACE...

00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:42.923
MY MASKED KNIGHT,
LEVEL THE FIFTH!

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:46.293
RETURNETH TO THY BATTLE,
MY BRAVE WARRIOR!

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:50.097
Announcer:
SIR RANDSBORG'S CRACKED
THE BLACK ROSE'S COMBO!

00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:52.599
THIS IS ANYONE'S DUEL NOW!

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:54.935
IT APPEARS YOU FORGOT
ABOUT BLACK GARDEN.

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:56.804
FOR EVERY MONSTER
YOU SUMMON,

00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:58.939
ITS ATTACK POINTS ARE
CUT IN HALF.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:00.107
[KNIGHT GROANING]

00:14:02.209 --> 00:14:06.313
AND NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT I'LL BE GETTING
ANOTHER ROSE TOKEN.

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:08.282
NOW I END MY TURN.

00:14:08.282 --> 00:14:12.052
SORCERESS, YOU DARE
ENCHANT MINE MONSTERS
WITH THINE SPELLS?

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:15.990
THY GARDEN
BE NO EDEN BUT SHALL
FALL THE SAME!

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.025
NOW, MINE KNIGHT,
YOU HATH EARNED PROMOTION

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.595
FOR BRAVE SERVICE AGAINST
THY MOST WICKED OPPONENT.

00:14:21.595 --> 00:14:23.197
HE'S RIGHT!

00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:25.165
THANKS TO MASKED KNIGHT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:14:25.165 --> 00:14:29.203
HE UPGRADES FROM LEVEL 5
ALL THE WAY TO LEVEL 7.

00:14:29.203 --> 00:14:32.139
NOW, JOIN
MINE SIDE! HYAH!

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.793
BLACK GARDEN,
DO YOUR THING.

00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:01.135
ONCE AGAIN,
ANOTHER ROSE TOKEN
SHALL BLOOM.

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:03.871
IMPRESSIVE.

00:15:03.871 --> 00:15:06.807
THOSE ROSE TOKENS
OF HERS CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE.

00:15:06.807 --> 00:15:08.842
SHE'S GOT
AN IMPENETRABLE WALL.

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:11.245
THE QUESTION IS,
CAN SHE HOLD OUT?

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:14.248
NOT EVEN A PRETTY
GARDEN CAN STOP
RANDSBORG FOREVER.

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:16.583
I'M AFRAID IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:17.985
BEFORE THAT BLACK ROSE
GETS CLIPPED.

00:15:33.704 --> 00:15:35.005
FOUL SHE-CREATURE,

00:15:35.005 --> 00:15:36.040
THOU HATH DRAPED THY
ARENA IN DARK FOLIAGE.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.742
YE HATH SEDUCED
MINE KNIGHTS,

00:15:38.742 --> 00:15:41.578
BUT NOW, THY DARK
DECK SHALL FALL
BEFORE MINE MIGHT!

00:15:41.612 --> 00:15:43.847
BEHOLD MY GLORY SHIELD!

00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:44.915
WITH IT, MY MASKED KNIGHT
BE IMPERVIOUS

00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:46.784
TO ANY OF THY
BEWITCHING SPELLS.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.355
NICE MOVE.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.790
AND NOW WHEN RANDSBORG
DECIDES TO BRING
IN THE BIG BLADES

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.125
AND ATTACK
WITH MASKED KNIGHT,

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:56.360
BLACK ROSE CAN'T
USE HER SPELL CARDS
OR TRAPS.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.629
AND IF IT
DOES DAMAGE,

00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:59.630
IT DESTROYS
A CARD.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.764
MAYBE
BLACK ROSE

00:16:00.764 --> 00:16:03.133
JUST ISN'T
SO POWERFUL
AFTER ALL.

00:16:03.133 --> 00:16:05.369
MASKED KNIGHT,
UNLEASH THINE POWERS

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:08.305
ON THY DARKEST
OF MONSTERS,
THE TOKENS OF ROSE!

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:11.241
CRY HAVOC
AND STRIKE DOWN

00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.876
THINE MAIDEN'S
LIFE POINTS!

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:14.878
Announcer: AND RANDSBORG
BRINGS THE HAMMER DOWN...

00:16:14.878 --> 00:16:16.313
OR SHOULD I SAY SWORD...

00:16:16.313 --> 00:16:18.582
AS AKIZA TAKES A BIG HIT!

00:16:18.615 --> 00:16:20.584
BLACK ROSE IS STARTING
TO WILT!

00:16:20.617 --> 00:16:22.653
A FEW MORE ATTACKS
LIKE THAT,

00:16:22.653 --> 00:16:24.221
AND SHE'LL BE CHECKING
THE WANT ADS!

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:26.023
DOES ANYONE NEED
A GARDENER?

00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:30.060
AND NOW MINE GLORY
SHIELD EFFECT DESTROYETH
THINE DOPPELGANGER!

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.595
WITH THY CURSED SPELL
LOST TO THEE,

00:16:31.628 --> 00:16:33.097
MASKED KNIGHT,

00:16:33.097 --> 00:16:35.666
UNLEASH THINE EFFECT
MOST SPECIAL.

00:16:39.203 --> 00:16:41.839
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:49.113
Announcer:
ONLY 50 LIFE POINTS LEFT?

00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:51.148
THIS DUEL IS ALL BUT OVER!

00:16:51.148 --> 00:16:52.783
IT'S A FOURTH ENCORE!

00:16:52.783 --> 00:16:53.784
IT'S A PARTY
WITH NO MUSIC!

00:16:53.784 --> 00:16:55.285
IT'S THE CLOSING CREDITS.

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:58.288
I END MINE TURN...

00:17:00.157 --> 00:17:02.593
SO DO YOU THINK
IT'S OVER?

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:04.862
NOT A CHANCE.
SHE'S JUST
GETTING WARMED UP.

00:17:04.862 --> 00:17:07.865
AND WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT? YOU KNOW HER?

00:17:07.865 --> 00:17:09.766
SOME ANCIENT
MYSTICAL BOND?

00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:10.834
THINE TURN.

00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:13.370
AND ANY LAST WORDS,
FAIR MAIDEN,

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.706
FOR YOU SHALL NOT
SEE ANOTHER! HA!

00:17:15.706 --> 00:17:17.541
YEAH.

00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.277
I GOT SOME LAST WORDS...
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:17:20.277 --> 00:17:23.947
LIAR!

00:17:23.947 --> 00:17:26.650
Gil, thinking: YOU HATH
LOST ALREADY, MY DEAR.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.719
I SEETH THINE CARDS
AS IF THEY BE MINE.

00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:30.888
YOU SHALL RELEASE
YOUR TOKENS OF ROSE,

00:17:30.888 --> 00:17:33.290
HOPING AGAINST HOPE
TO SUMMON A CREATURE.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.092
AND THAT SHALL BE
THY UNDOING.

00:17:35.092 --> 00:17:36.960
FOR ONCE SUMMONED,
THY BLACK GARDEN

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.862
WILL AFFORD ME
A TOKEN OF ROSE.

00:17:38.862 --> 00:17:40.330
YOU SHALL ATTACK.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.599
AND YOU SHALL FAIL,
FOR YOU HATH NO IDEA

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:45.235
WHAT DWELLS BENEATH
MINE CARD MOST FACEDOWN.

00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:47.771
LIKE ALL DUELISTS
WHO BATTLED BEFORE ME,

00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:48.872
YOU HATH NO MIND
FOR STRATEGY.

00:17:48.872 --> 00:17:51.975
WAITING FOR YOU IS
MY MARTYR FLAG...

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:53.143
A SPELL
MOST SIMPLE, TRUE,

00:17:53.143 --> 00:17:54.378
BUT IT SHALL DOUBLE
THY ATTACK POINTS

00:17:54.378 --> 00:17:57.047
OF MY MASKED KNIGHT.

00:17:57.047 --> 00:17:59.783
YOU SHALL TASTE
THE AGONY OF DEFEAT

00:17:59.783 --> 00:18:02.119
AND LEARN NOT
TO TREAD HERE
IN MINE ARENA!

00:18:03.253 --> 00:18:06.256
SO WHAT TO DO?

00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:10.360
I THINK
I'LL DESTROY
MY BLACK GARDEN!

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.361
WHAT'S THIS,
A TRICK OF SOME SORT?

00:18:11.361 --> 00:18:14.831
TRICK? NO.
STRATEGY? YES.

00:18:14.831 --> 00:18:16.800
SEE, YOU'VE GOT
TO LEARN TO LOOK

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.802
BEYOND THE BEAUTY
OF MY ROSES.

00:18:18.802 --> 00:18:20.671
BY DESTROYING
MY BLACK GARDEN
AND MY ROSE TOKENS,

00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:22.239
I GET TO SUMMON
A NEW MONSTER:

00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:23.674
ONE THAT'S
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:18:23.674 --> 00:18:24.675
YOU WOULD NOT!

00:18:24.675 --> 00:18:25.809
OH, BOY.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:27.344
Yanagi, Leo, and Dexter:
IT CAN'T BE.

00:18:28.745 --> 00:18:30.914
NOW IF MY MATH IS
CORRECT... AND IT ALWAYS IS...

00:18:30.914 --> 00:18:33.150
THEN AKIZA HAS SACRIFICED
ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.620
TO SUMMON
THE BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:18:38.188 --> 00:18:41.992
THAT THING IS DANGEROUS!

00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:46.296
NOW SAY HELLO TO
MY BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:51.835
Computer:
BLACK ROSE DRAGON IS

00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:54.171
A LEVEL 7 FIRE
ATTRIBUTE SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:18:54.171 --> 00:18:56.106

00:18:56.106 --> 00:18:58.208
AND 1,800 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:18:58.208 --> 00:18:59.710
Announcer: AKIZA DID IT!

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.345
BUT IS IT TOO LATE?

00:19:01.345 --> 00:19:03.113
WITH BLACK GARDEN
GONE, MASKED KNIGHT'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:19:03.113 --> 00:19:05.148
GO BACK
TO THEIR MAXIMUM!

00:19:05.148 --> 00:19:06.817
AND IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FAIRY TALES

00:19:06.817 --> 00:19:08.819
WHEN IT COMES TO
KNIGHTS VERSUS DRAGONS,

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:11.188
IT NEVER ENDS WELL
FOR THE DRAGON!

00:19:11.188 --> 00:19:12.689
WITH NOTHING ELSE
ON HER FIELD,

00:19:12.689 --> 00:19:14.992
BLACK ROSE
CAN'T WIN THIS.

00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:16.193
TOO BAD, TOO.
I THOUGHT
SHE HAD IT.

00:19:16.193 --> 00:19:18.228
YE TRULY ARE
A FOOL, MILADY.

00:19:18.228 --> 00:19:19.563
PERHAPS YE SHOULD
LAY THY CARDS DOWN

00:19:19.563 --> 00:19:22.032
AND GO TEND
TO THINE GARDEN.

00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:23.367
GREEN THUMB YOU HATH NOT

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:24.935
WHEN IT COMES TO DUELING.

00:19:24.935 --> 00:19:26.069
I SURE HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

00:19:26.069 --> 00:19:29.239
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS DUEL'S OVER.

00:19:29.239 --> 00:19:31.174
YEAH. BUT IT
WON'T PLAY OUT
LIKE YOU THINK.

00:19:31.174 --> 00:19:32.242
SAY WHAT?

00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:38.215
DUE TO MY
BLACK ROSE DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:39.983
IF I REMOVE
A PLANT-TYPE MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:19:39.983 --> 00:19:41.752
FROM PLAY,

00:19:41.752 --> 00:19:44.721
YOUR MASKED
KNIGHT'S ATTACK
POINTS GO TO ZERO.

00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:47.758
GO, BLACK
BINDING BLOOM!

00:19:54.398 --> 00:19:56.733
BUT THOUEST CANNOT
DO THAT TO ME!

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:58.402
IT BE NOT FAIR.

00:19:58.402 --> 00:20:01.271
I SPENT ALL YEAR
MAKING THIS COSTUME FOR
THIS SPECIAL TOURNAMENT!

00:20:01.271 --> 00:20:02.272
I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO LOSE!

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:04.941
WELL, TOO BAD.

00:20:04.941 --> 00:20:07.177
AND NEXT TIME
YOU WANT TO PLAY
DRESS-UP,

00:20:07.177 --> 00:20:08.378
YOU SHOULD REALIZE

00:20:08.378 --> 00:20:10.113
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WEAR
ON THE OUTSIDE

00:20:10.113 --> 00:20:11.581
THAT MAKES YOU
WHO YOU ARE,

00:20:11.615 --> 00:20:13.717
BUT WHAT'S
ON THE INSIDE.

00:20:13.717 --> 00:20:15.018
I WANT TO GO HOME!
TAKE IT EASY NOW!

00:20:15.018 --> 00:20:17.287
I AM TAKING IT EASY!

00:20:17.287 --> 00:20:21.291
BLACK ROSE DRAGON,
ATTACK!

00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:24.761
[GIL YELLING]

00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:27.297
[CROWD SCREAMS]

00:20:27.297 --> 00:20:28.965
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:30.734
I THINK RANDSBORG
WORKED WELL.

00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:33.036
NOW TO CHECK IN
WITH ZIGZIX!

00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:35.172
SO TELL US, WHAT DID
YOUR D-TECTOR SEE?

00:20:35.172 --> 00:20:36.640
WELL, UM,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.676
THERE WAS NO
SIGNER ENERGY.

00:20:39.676 --> 00:20:40.844
WE GOT NOTHING.

00:20:42.646 --> 00:20:43.914
THEN KEEP LOOKING.

00:20:50.754 --> 00:20:53.690
I KNEW SHE'D
WIN THAT DUEL.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.259
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LIKE
YOU TWO ARE CONNECTED?

00:20:56.259 --> 00:20:58.695
Yusei: I DON'T KNOW.

00:20:58.695 --> 00:21:00.597
BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING
BETWEEN US.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.300
[MOANING]

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.168
Man: HER MONSTERS
ARE REAL!

00:21:05.168 --> 00:21:06.269
Girl: BOO! GET
HER OUT OF HERE!

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:08.672
[SCATTERED BOOS]

00:21:10.207 --> 00:21:12.876
NOT A BAD WIN, AKIZA.

00:21:12.876 --> 00:21:17.547
BUT I GOT A BAD FEELING
THAT YOUR REAL FIGHT IS

00:21:17.547 --> 00:21:21.151
JUST ABOUT TO
GET STARTED. GOOD LUCK.
