INFINITE AURA GAINS ONE COUNTER

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:22.508
FOR EVERY 100 POINTS OF DAMAGE
THAT I TAKE.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.015
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:32.485
Lester: THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.453
LET'S JUST SAY
WHEN INFINITE AURA

00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:36.455
ABSORBS ENOUGH DAMAGE

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:38.724
YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE
ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.092
[LAUGHS]

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.761
Jack: SO RIGHT NOW,
IT DOES NOTHING.

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:42.762
GOT YA.

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:44.997
THEN I END MY TURN.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.165
Crow: ALL RIGHT, JACK!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.967
THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD
ROUND FOR US.

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:49.902
JACK REMAINED UNSCATHED.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.003
THIS IS SO GREAT.

00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:52.471
Luna: WOO-HOO!

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:59.512
Primo: THAT FOOL ATLAS
HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TRIGGERED.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:03.449
Jakob: INDEED, THIS IS THE
BEGINNING OF THE END.

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:20.866
Lester: IT'S MY MOVE, JACKY!

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:25.371
AND I ACTIVATE MEKLORD EMPEROR
SKIEL'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:29.175
ONCE A TURN, THIS BAD BOY CAN
ABSORB ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:37.383
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL TAKE RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.218
Jack: ACTUALLY, I DO MIND.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:42.054
NOW, BY REMOVING MY RED NOVA
DRAGON FROM PLAY

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.825
FROM PLAY, I CAN PUT A STOP TO
YOUR MONSTER'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:18:45.825 --> 00:18:47.693
HOW'S THAT FOR A SURPRISE?

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:51.397
WITH NO TARGET, YOUR SPECIAL
ABILITY IS COMPLETELY USELESS.

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:52.598
YOUR EMPEROR CAN'T
ABSORB MY DRAGON.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.599
SWEET.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:54.667
HE DID IT.

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:57.803
AS LONG AS JACK HAS
RED NOVA DRAGON'S POWER

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.106
HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE
SCARED OF MEKLORD EMPEROR.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:01.107
YEAH.

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:02.842
Lester: HUMPH, YOU'RE NO FUN.

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:06.112
I END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN CARD.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:10.650
Jack: AND WITH THAT RED NOVA
DRAGON RETURNS TO THE FIELD.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.386
MC: LOOKS LIKE JACK ATLAS HAS
FOUND A WAY TO SEVERELY CRIPPLE

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:14.887
LESTER'S STRATEGY.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.222
AND BLOCKING HIS WAY IS JACK

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:21.427
ATLAS'S NEWEST ACE,
RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:24.864
THAT LITTLE HALF-PINT HAS LOST
HIS ABILITY TO COUNTERATTACK.

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:26.098
THAT'S GREAT AND ALL

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.334
BUT NOW NEITHER ONE OF THEM
CAN DEAL ANY DAMAGE.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.902
CARLY'S RIGHT-- IT
SEEMS LIKE WE COULD HAVE

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:33.973
A STALEMATE ON OUR HANDS.

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:34.974
Lazar: COME ON, JACK.

00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:36.142
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

00:19:36.142 --> 00:19:37.910
WIN THIS THING ALREADY.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.312
I'M GOING CRAZY, HERE!

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.848
Jack: THIS IS THE STANDOFF
I'VE BEEN BUILDING TOWARDS.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:44.183
SOON, RED NOVA DRAGON

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:48.554
WILL HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM
YOUR MEKLORD EMPEROR.

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:52.191
IT'S MY TURN.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.893
HMPH.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:56.228
I'M SUMMONING FORCE RESONATOR.

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.330
BY SENDING THIS BLOKE
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.567
I CAN PREVENT YOUR MONSTER FROM
ACTIVATING ITS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:06.272
WHEN MY SYNCHRO MONSTER
ATTACKS THIS TURN.

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:09.909
WHICH MEANS RED NOVA DRAGON CAN
TEAR INTO YOUR EMPEROR

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:12.478
AND THERE IS NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:14.146
UM, SAY WHAT?

00:20:14.146 --> 00:20:16.882
OH, AND NOW THAT THERE'S ANOTHER
TUNER IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:20.920
RED NOVA DRAGON GAINS ANOTHER
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.855
THIS BATTLE IS MINE.

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:27.426
RED NOVA DRAGON, SOAR IN AND
ATTACK MEKLORD EMPEROR SKIEL!

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:31.163
GO BLAZING SOUL STRIKE!

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.833
[WHOOSHING SOUNDS]

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.368
Lester: I ACTIVATE
THE INFINITE PRISON TRAP.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:39.338
BY PULLING ONE CARD FROM
MY HAND AND DISCARDING IT

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:42.108
I CAN USE INFINITE PRISON TO
TAKE ONE MONSTER CARD

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:44.176
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
AND TREAT IT AS IF IT WERE

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.244
A SPELL CARD.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.245
THAT'S USELESS.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:47.847
IT CAN'T SAVE
YOUR MEKLORD EMPEROR

00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:50.483
AND IT CAN'T SAVE YOU.

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.952
[LESTER GRUNTS]

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.255
Lester: NOW MY INFINITE AURA'S
EFFECT KICKS IN.

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:58.190
AND THAT MEANS IT NOW GAINS A
COUNTER

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.960
FOR EVERY 100
POINTS OF DAMAGE I TOOK

00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:10.069
MC: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT... IS... OVER!

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:12.638
JACK ATLAS HAS BURIED
TEAM NEW WORLD'S LESTER

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.940
BENEATH AN AVALANCHE OF
ONE-HUNDRED-PERCENT

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.576
PURIFIED PERFECTION!

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:18.577
Luna: ALL RIGHT!

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.980
YEAH, YOU DID IT, JACK!

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.882
YEAH, KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING.

00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:25.885
SEND THE NEXT JOKER
TO THE SAME PLACE.

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:27.486
Yusei: <i>SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.</i>

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:31.357
<i>THAT WAS WAY TOO EASY.</i>

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:32.992
WAY TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:34.460
YOU DID WELL.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.163
WHATEVER.

00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:38.798
IT WOULD'VE BEEN YOU
TAKING THE FALL

00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:42.635
IF I HADN'T LOST TO YOU
IN ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:43.936
STUPID SCISSORS.

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:46.806
Jakob: WHAT MATTERS IS
THAT OUR PLAN IS IN MOTION.

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.841
THEY'VE THRUST THEMSELVES
INTO A TEMPEST

00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.309
FROM WHICH THEY CANNOT ESCAPE.

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.310
RIGHT.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.478
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:56.215
THAT NEW DOMINO CITY'S TIME
IS ALMOST UP.
