00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.403
NOW LET'S GET UP TO
SPEED WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:04.638
KALIN KESSLER?

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.473
YOU WERE ONCE
OUR FRIEND!

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.878
"ONCE YOUR FRIEND,"
YES BUT NOW YOUR ENEMY!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.622
I COULD HAVE GIVEN
YOU EVERYTHING!

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.524
BUT YOU WERE TOO SCARED!

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.893
YOU KNEW THE ONLY WAY
THE SATELLITE COULD BE OURS

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.095
WAS IF WE ELIMINATED
EVERY THREAT.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.734
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,
CCAPAC APU!

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:37.571
POUND THIS PATHETIC
SIGNER INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:38.672
YUSEI!

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:39.907
WATCH OUT!

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:47.814
WHAT WAS IT THAT
TOURNAMENT MC STARTED
CALLING YOU?

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.182
"SATELLITE'S
SHOOTING STAR?"

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.552
MORE LIKE "SATELLITE'S
FALLING STAR."

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.487
SEE YOU AROUND,
YUSEI.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.791
YOU OKAY?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.326
AH, MY GUT!

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.827
HEY, YUSEI, CAN
YA' HEAR ME?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.964
Crow: DON'T TOUCH HIM!

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.332
CROW!

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.700
I'LL TAKE HIM
TO MARTHA'S PLACE.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.435
GOOD IDEA.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.070
I NEED HANDS
OUT HERE, PEOPLE.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.372
COME HELP ME GET
YUSEI INSIDE!

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.807
IS HE GOING
TO BE ALRIGHT?

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.809
IT'S A LONG SHOT.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.878

[GROANING]

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.948
DOCTOR,
HOW'S IT LOOKING?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.549
THERE'S A LOT
OF INTERNAL BRUISING,

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.351
BUT I'LL KNOW
MORE SHORTLY.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.061
POOR YUSEI.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.129
HUH?

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:46.633
TELL US DOC!
HOW'S HE DOIN'?!

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.735
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'LL MAKE
A COMPLETE RECOVERY.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:50.604
HE'LL NEED A FEW
MORE DAYS OF REST
IN BED,

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:52.139
BUT HE'LL BE
JUST FINE.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.674
JUST KEEP HIM FROM
UNDERGROUND DUELS

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.542
FOR A WHILE OKAY?

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.244
YOU'RE THE DOC!

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.179
SO, WHAT NOW?

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:01.348
NOW?! WE FIND THAT
DARK SIGNER

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.083
AND MAKE HIM PAY!

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.251
HMM.
HMM.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.821
AH-AH-HA...

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:08.889
AHCHOO!
AHCHOO!

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.290
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.393
WALKING ALL NIGHT
WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES!

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.162
I THINK WE ALL
CAUGHT A COLD!

00:03:15.162 --> 00:03:18.131
JUST PERFECT.
I'LL MAKE SOME SOUP.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:26.073
HEH HEH. WILL YOU LOOK
AT THIS PLACE?!

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:28.542
THIS IS ONE TIME I
DON'T MIND BABYSITTING!

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.377
HOLD ON!
YOU'RE NOT
BABYSITTING.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:31.745
YOU'RE JUST HERE
'CAUSE YUSEI
WAS WORRIED

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.480
ABOUT THOSE
DARK SIGNERS
COMING AFTER US!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.148
BUT DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THEM!

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.784
LUNA AND ME'LL
PROTECT YOU WITH OUR
AWESOME DUELING!

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.189
JUST BETWEEN YOU
AND ME, MISTER TANNER,

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.658
I'D STICK CLOSE
TO ME WHEN THINGS
GET REAL ROUGH.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:47.327
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT
BOYS DUEL BETTER
THAN THE GIRLS DO.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.062
IT'S ACTUALLY
A SCIENTIFIC FACT!

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.063
OF COURSE.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.665
CHECK OUT THIS POOL.

00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:53.900
DOES ANYONE MIND IF I
DO SOME AQUA-ROBICS.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.669
WHY DON'T WE TRY
CHECKING ON YUSEI

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.638
BEFORE YOU START SPLASHIN'
TO THE OLDIES, YANAGI?

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.375
IS YUSEI OKAY?

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.578
LAST NIGHT LUNA'S
SIGN STARTED GLOWING
SUPER BRIGHT!

00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.279
DOES THAT MEAN
HE'S DUELING
A DARK SIGNER?

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:07.748
IS HE IN TROUBLE?!

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:10.150
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE A TIMEOUT
FROM THE QUESTION GAME

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.319
AND LET ME SEE
IF YUSEI'S CHECKED IN.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.454
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
NO EMAIL FROM HIM YET.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.289
WHAT IF GOODWIN
LOCKED HIM UP?!

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.525
CALM DOWN.
I'M SURE HE'S TAKIN' OUT

00:04:18.525 --> 00:04:20.660
DARK SIGNERS
OR SOMETHIN'.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.962
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:23.497
NO ONE CAN STOP
YUSEI!

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.398
HE'S JUST TOO SLICK!

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.468
BUT, IF HE'S OK, WHY
WAS YOUR ARM GLOWING
LAST NIGHT?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.537
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT WAS
MY DREAM.

00:04:30.537 --> 00:04:32.939
I SAW THESE DRAGONS
FIGHTING THIS
SHADOW ARMY!

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.508
Yanagi: MAYBE YOUR SIGN
WAS SHOWING YOU

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:37.244
THE ORIGINAL BATTLE
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.579
AND HOW TO BEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.849
OHH.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.556
SO TELL ME,
WITH ALL THESE DRAGONS,

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:52.092
MY POWER TOOL DRAGON
HAD TO BE THERE!

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:56.196
HUH? WELL, THERE
WAS ONE THAT KINDA
LOOKED LIKE YOURS

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:57.798
BUT WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:00.300
"WHAT DIFF'RENCE?!"
POWER TOOL'S MY DRAGON!

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.468
IF HE WAS THERE,
THEN, THAT MEANS THAT

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.936
I'M THE FIFTH SIGNER!

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.005
I KNEW IT!
NOW I'LL SAVE THE WORLD!

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:07.140
HERE COMES LEO!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.010
GOOD THING I'VE
BEEN WORKING ON MY
VICTORY DANCE!

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.244
WHEN DO YOU THINK
I'LL GET MY SIGN?

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:12.612
WAS HIS DRAGON
REALLY THERE?!

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:14.748
NO! I JUST FELT SO
BAD FOR HIM!

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.783
HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
WHEN HIS ARM NEVER
STARTS GLOWING.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.151
I SURE HOPE SO.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.087
MAYBE I HAVE TO RUB.
YOU KNOW LIKE A GENIE!

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.756
OR, HE'LL RUB
HIS ARMS SO HARD

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.858
THAT THEY MIGHT
ACTUALLY START
TO GLOW.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.295
I FEEL IT!
DRAGON POWER!

00:05:28.295 --> 00:05:29.496
IT'S FLOWING
THROUGH MY BODY

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.398
LIKE SOME SORT
OF SUPER SPORTS DRINK!

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:32.966
NOW, I'M READY
FOR ANYTHING,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.602
ESPECIALLY A DUEL
WITH THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:05:35.602 --> 00:05:38.205
LET'S HEAR
THAT BATTLE CRY!

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.274
EEH.
UHH.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:43.210
HA!

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.246
SO SINCE WE FIGHT EVIL,
THAT MEANS WE'RE
SUPERHEROES.

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:48.682
AND SUPERHEROES ARE
ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO
STICK TOGETHER.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.584
THAT'S LIKE THEIR
MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:52.219
AND, UH,
THE SUPER POWERS.

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.087
BUT YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, LEO.

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.823
WE STICK TOGETHER,
RIGHT HERE IN THIS
NICE COZY MANSION.

00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.191
AND AKIZA?

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.759
AKIZA? WHY HER?

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.261
SHE MAY BE A SIGNER.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:02.596
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN WE CAN
TRUST HER...

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:04.231
SHE'S PART OF
THAT WEIRD ARCADIA
MOVEMENT

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:06.199
THAT'S GOT
ALL THE PSYCHICS.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.601
"THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT?"

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.269
YOU MEAN LIKE
WITH VIDEO GAMES?

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.304
IT'S "ARCADIA"
NOT ARCADE.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.639
THEIR GROUP
COLLECTS PSYCHICS

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.907
FROM ALL
OVER THE WORLD.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.141
THEN THEY TEST
THEIR ABILITIES

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.676
TO MOVE OBJECTS
WITH THEIR MINDS.

00:06:16.676 --> 00:06:18.645
TO SEE IF THEY
HAVE SUPER POWERS?!

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:21.014
WELL SORT OF,
BUT THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE

00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:22.816
IS TO TRAIN THEM
TO BE DUELISTS WHO BATTLE

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:24.584
AND INFLICT REAL DAMAGE.

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:26.920
BUT AKIZA WOULD
NEVER REALLY WANT
TO HURT PEOPLE!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.288
WHO KNOWS.

00:06:28.288 --> 00:06:32.158
I SAY WE STAY AS FAR
AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.029
HEY, BUT, YANAGI AGREED
THAT US HEROES GOTTA
STICK TOGETHER...

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.797
WHAT IF SHE NEEDS
OUR HELP?

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.633
HUH?!
OR WHAT IF YUSEI'S
IN TROUBLE

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:41.501
AND WE NEED AKIZA'S DECK
AS BACK UP?

00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:43.236
THERE'S LIKE TOTALLY
A MILLION REASONS

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.671
THAT THIS IS
A GOOD IDEA.

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:46.239
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.875
THEY WANT TO GO
AND GET AKIZA
FROM ARCADIA.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.810
GOOD PLAN!
I'LL JUST STAY HERE

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.946
AND KEEP AN EYE
ON THE HEATED JACUZZI.

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.948
HOLD ON!
WHO SAYS WE'RE
GOING ANYWHERE?

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.751
WE SHOULD STAY PUT
UNTIL WE HEAR
FROM YUSEI.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.386
WHAT IF WE DON'T
HEAR FROM HIM?

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:02.122
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE MIGHT NEED OUR HELP!

00:07:02.122 --> 00:07:03.757
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF THERE STILL
NO EMAIL,

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:05.191
SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM THAT

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.726
NEEDS SIGNER
BACK UP.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.862
Computer: NO NEW MESSAGES.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.631
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GONNA PAY AKIZA
A VISIT, AFTER ALL!

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.317
[PANTING]

00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:41.322
HUH.

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.524
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:07:42.524 --> 00:07:43.992
NORMALLY, AKIZA
WOULD'VE TAKEN DOWN

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:45.560
THAT DUEL-BOT
IN A COUPLE ROUNDS.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.961
THIS MATCH WENT
NEARLY EIGHT.

00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:48.163
THERE'S NO DOUBT
HER PSYCHIC POWERS

00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:49.798
HAVE WEAKENED SINCE
THE TOURNAMENT,

00:07:49.798 --> 00:07:51.499
WHERE SHE LOST
TO YUSEI FUDO.

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.234
I DON'T PAY YOU FOR
TELLING ME WHAT I KNOW.

00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:54.602
SHE NEEDS FIXING.

00:07:54.602 --> 00:07:55.804
SHE'S LOST DUELS BEFORE,

00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:56.971
WHAT'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME?

00:07:56.971 --> 00:08:00.642
IT'S NOT THE DUEL.
IT WAS HER OPPONENT.

00:08:00.642 --> 00:08:04.245
YES COULD IT BE THAT
OUR AKIZA HAS A CRUSH?

00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.384
AKIZA, THAT'S WAS
AN IMPRESSIVE DUEL.

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:10.618
YEAH RIGHT.

00:08:10.618 --> 00:08:12.020
YOU'RE TOO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.254
WHATEVER'S
TROUBLING YOU,

00:08:13.254 --> 00:08:14.789
YOU CAN ALWAYS
TELL ME.

00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:06.213

WAYS IN WHICH THEY'VE

00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:08.782

A HERO?! HA.

SHE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY

NOW, BE SURE TO DUEL
HARD 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.537
YOU'LL END UP LOCKED AWAY
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

00:16:30.537 --> 00:16:32.139
SHALL WE?

00:16:32.139 --> 00:16:34.441

THAT'S THE SPIR'T!

00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:53.560

I SUMMON
MY MORPHTRONIC RADION!

00:16:57.831 --> 00:16:59.032
WHEN HE'S
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:16:59.032 --> 00:17:00.567
ALL THE OTHER
MORPHTRONIC MONSTERS

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:03.236

800 ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:08.742
WITH THAT BONUS

MORPHTRONIC, ATTAAACK!

00:17:14.114 --> 00:17:16.349
I ACTIVATE
MY KREBONS' ABILITY!

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.684
INSTEAD OF IT BEING
DESTROYED,

00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:21.021
I CAN SAVE MY MONSTER
BY PAYING 800 LIFE POINTS!

00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:23.657
YOU GOTTA SPEND POINTS

00:17:23.657 --> 00:17:25.859
HEH HEH!

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:27.627
IF THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A STRATEGY,

00:17:27.627 --> 00:17:29.529
THEN YOU'RE
IN BIG, BIG
TROUBLE!!

00:17:29.529 --> 00:17:32.165
AND SO IS YOUR ARMY!
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE.

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:36.069
NOW I SUMMON
PSYCHIC SNAIL!

00:17:36.069 --> 00:17:39.139
AAH! IT'S GOT
ALMOST TWO THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:39.139 --> 00:17:40.607
LEO, COME NOW.

00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:42.375
I SAID THIS WAS A TEST.

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:45.045

00:17:45.045 --> 00:17:48.582
PSYCHIC SNAIL, ATTACK!

00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:50.117
[GROANS]

00:17:50.117 --> 00:17:51.785
HEY! WHAT WAS THAT?!

00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:53.420
SOMETHING JUST
SHOCKED ME!

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.289
THAT IS THE RESULT OF MY
PSYCHIC DUELING POWER, LEO,

00:17:56.289 --> 00:17:58.091
AND IF YOU EVER
HOPE TO BEAT ME,

00:17:58.091 --> 00:17:59.726
YOU BETTER USE YOUR OWN.

00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:03.930
KREBONS, GIVE LEO
ANOTHER TASTE!

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.600
AAH! AAH! UGH!

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.304
LEO! PLEASE

00:18:11.304 --> 00:18:12.639
THAT'S MY BROTHER!

00:18:12.639 --> 00:18:14.274
I CAN'T, LUNA.

00:18:14.274 --> 00:18:16.243
ONCE THE TEST BEGINS,
IT CAN ONLY BE STOPPED

00:18:16.243 --> 00:18:18.111
ONCE A DUELIST LOSES.

00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:19.412
LEO!

00:18:34.731 --> 00:18:35.799
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:38.068
I WANNA GO HOME!
AAH!

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:40.737
IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE
YOU SISTER AGAIN, LEO,

00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:43.740
I WOULD QUIT THE WHINING
AND SHOW ME YOUR
PSYCHIC POWERS!

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.709
NOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET UP AND DUEL

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.444
OR RUST MY STEEL FLOOR?!

00:18:47.444 --> 00:18:49.046
LEAVE US ALONE!

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:50.881
I'M DOING THIS
AS A FAVOR!

00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.516
YOU'LL THANK
ME IN THE END.

00:18:52.516 --> 00:18:55.319
IF YOU WANNA SEE LUNA,
SHOW ME YOUR POWERS!

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:59.523
ERR. YOU'RE GONNA WISH
YOU NEVER MESSED
WITH MY SISTER!

00:18:59.523 --> 00:19:01.625
NOBODY GETS
AWAY WITH THAT!

00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:03.293
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, LEO!

00:19:03.293 --> 00:19:05.095
COME AT ME
WITH ALL THAT ANGER,

00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:07.898
ALL THAT EMOTION
YOU HAVE BURIED
DEEP DOWN INSIDE.

00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:09.433
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
ARE YOU JUST GONNA CRY?

00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:11.735
OR ARE YOU GONNA DUEL?

00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.571
I'M GONNA WIN!

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:18.609
I SUMMON OUT:
MORPHTRONIC REMOTEN!

00:19:18.609 --> 00:19:20.611
[CHIRPS]

00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:23.447
AND THEN,
I'M GONNA ACTIVATE
THE SPELL JUNK BOX!

00:19:23.447 --> 00:19:28.719
AND THANKS TO THAT,
I GET TO RE-SUMMON
MORPHTRONIC RADION!

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:31.755
AND NEXT I'LL
TUNE MY REMOTEN
WITH MY RADION!

00:19:35.292 --> 00:19:37.060
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET
A LITTLE TASTE

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.664
OF WHAT I GOT IN STORE
FOR THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:19:40.664 --> 00:19:44.267
I SYNCHRO SUMMON:
POWER TOOL DRAGON!

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.573
Computer: POWER TOOL DRAGON IS
A LEVEL 7 MACHINE TYPE MONSTER

00:19:49.573 --> 00:19:55.012
THAT HAS 2300 ATTACK POINTS
AND 2500 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:19:55.012 --> 00:19:59.149
NICE, NOW KEEP THAT FOCUS
AND HARNESS THE ENERGY
THAT FLOWS WITHIN.

00:19:59.149 --> 00:20:00.651
WELL HOW'S THIS
FOR ENERGY:

00:20:00.651 --> 00:20:02.819
I USE MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:06.223
SO THAT I CAN PLAY
A RANDOM EQUIP SPELL
FROM MY DECK!

00:20:06.223 --> 00:20:09.126
YES, NOW I CAN PLAY
DOUBLE TOOL CAMPED,

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:11.061
WHICH GIVES AN
EXTRA ONE THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS

00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.796
TO THE MONSTER
I EQUIP IT TO,

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:15.499
SO SAY GOODBYE TO
YOUR KREBONS!

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:19.202
POWER TOOL DRAGON,
YOU'RE ABOUT TO
GET A POWER UP!

00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:22.572
SMILE! 'CAUSE HERE

00:20:22.572 --> 00:20:24.741

00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:26.410
WAIT, YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE THING!

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.545
IF I SACRIFICE
800 LIFE POINTS,

00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:30.747
KREBONS' SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:33.350
WHICH COMPLETELY CANCELS
YOUR DRAGON'S ATTACK!

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.252
FOR A PSYCHIC YOU
DON'T KNOW MUCH!

00:20:35.252 --> 00:20:37.754
WITH DOUBLE TOOL,
NOT ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS CAN USE

00:20:37.754 --> 00:20:39.156
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:41.058
SO NOW LET'S KEEP THAT
DRAGON ATTACK GOIN'!

00:20:41.058 --> 00:20:42.059
WHAT?!

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:43.060
ERR!

00:20:45.095 --> 00:20:46.830
HEH. NOT BAD!

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:50.667
I KNOW.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.202
NEXT TIME, YOU SHOULD
BE MORE CAREFUL

00:20:52.202 --> 00:20:53.937
WHO YOU KNOCK OUT
WITH GAS.

00:20:53.937 --> 00:20:55.605
'CAUSE, IN CASE YOU
HADN'T HEARD, MISTER,

00:20:55.605 --> 00:20:59.142
I'M THE FIFTH SIGNER,
AND I'M GONNA
SAVE MY SISTER!

00:20:59.142 --> 00:21:01.611
[THINKING]
OH. BE CAREFUL!

00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:05.549
IT'S MY MOVE.
I PLAY THE SPELL
PSI-STATION!

00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:08.719
AND ONCE I ACTIVATE IT,
WHEN I SUMMON ANY OTHER

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:12.155
PSYCHIC MONSTER
IF I SACRIFICE
500 LIFE POINTS,

00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:14.558
THEN MY NEW MONSTER GETS
A NICE LITTLE BONUS

00:21:14.558 --> 00:21:17.594
TO THE TUNE OF 300
EXTRA ATTACK POINTS!

00:21:17.594 --> 00:21:19.896
AND I'VE GOT JUST
THE MONSTER TO USE IT.

00:21:19.896 --> 00:21:22.365
I SUMMON
PSYCHIC COMMANDER!

00:21:24.968 --> 00:21:27.938
NOW I'LL SACRIFICING
THOSE 500 LIFE POINTS

00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:31.742
I JUST MENTIONED TO
ACTIVATE MY PSI-STATION!

00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:34.111
AND DUE TO ITS EFFECT
MY PSYCHIC COMMANDER'S

00:21:34.111 --> 00:21:36.646
ATTACK POINTS
AND POWER LEVEL INCREASE!

00:21:36.646 --> 00:21:39.182
HE'S STILL NO MATCH
FOR MY TOOL DRAGON!

00:21:39.182 --> 00:21:41.718
AND YOU'D BE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT IF I WAS FINISHED,

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.453
BUT I THINK I'LL USE
MY COMMANDER

00:21:43.453 --> 00:21:47.157
TO TUNE PSYCHIC SNAIL
FOR A SYNCHRO SUMMON!

00:21:47.157 --> 00:21:50.360
I'VE GIVEN YOU PLENTY
OF CHANCES TO SHOW ME
YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.662
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE!

00:21:52.662 --> 00:21:57.134
I SUMMON
THOUGHT RULER ARCHFIEND!

00:21:57.134 --> 00:21:58.668
HA HA HA!

00:21:58.668 --> 00:21:59.970
OHH!

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:05.375
[ROARS]

00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:07.844
I HAVE TO BE BRAVE
FOR MY SISTER!

00:22:07.844 --> 00:22:10.647
OKAY, LEO, HE'S BIGGER,
BUT AS LONG

00:22:10.647 --> 00:22:12.249
AS YOUR DRAGON'S
EQUIPPED WITH
DOUBLE TOOL,

00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:14.785
YOU CAN SACRIFICE IT IN
ORDER TO KEEP HIM ALIVE!

00:22:14.785 --> 00:22:17.754
I MUST SAY I APPLAUD
YOUR INNOVATIVE STRATEGY.

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:20.924
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WILL ONLY WORK IF I
ATTACK YOUR DRAGON.

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:22.559
BUT... BUT YOU
HAVE TO!

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:25.762
I'M SORRY, BUT I'LL
BE USING MY TRAP CARD
RIGHT NOW.

00:22:25.762 --> 00:22:27.597
IT'S CALLED
BATTLE TELEPORTATION,

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.499
AND IT ALLOWS ME
TO ATTACK YOU

00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:31.334
AND BYPASS YOUR DRAGON!

00:22:31.334 --> 00:22:33.303
AAH!

00:22:33.303 --> 00:22:37.641
ARCHFIEND, I'M AFRAID
WE HAVE TO GIVE LEO
A FAILING GRADE.

00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:40.744
AAH! AAH! AAH!

00:22:40.744 --> 00:22:42.445
[GROANS]

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:44.047
SORRY, LUNA.

00:22:55.225 --> 00:22:58.929
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE BOY'S NOT
SO SPECIAL AFTER ALL.

00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:01.231
AT LEAST I STILL
HAVE THE GIRL.

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:05.669
OH NO! WHY ISN'T
HE MOVING??!!

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:07.304
COME ON, PLEASE LEO!
