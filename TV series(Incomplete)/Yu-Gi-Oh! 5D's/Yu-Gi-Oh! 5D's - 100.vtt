WEBVTT

00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:05.239
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO
SPEED WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S"!

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.640
MC: OH MY WORD!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.610
JACK ATLAS'S DUEL RUNNER
HAS JUST BEEN DECIMATED!

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.044
LET'S HOPE
HE'S OKAY.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.546
UNBELIEVABLE!

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:14.982
JACK ATLAS IS ATTEMPTING
TO RIGHT HIS WRECKED RUNNER

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:16.283
ALL BY
HIMSELF!

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.952
TEAM UNICORN NEEDS TO
ONLY COMPLETE ONE MORE LAP

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.254
WHILE THE
INJURED JACK ATLAS

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.256
NEEDS TO ONLY CRAWL
A FEW MORE FEET!

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.924
UHH!

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:27.294
AAAH!

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.898
MC: HE
DID IT!

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:32.266
NOW MY
PET...

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.201
ATTACK
AKIZA DIRECTLY!

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.204
SUPER
CHARGER BOLT!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.042
TELL US IT'S
NOT HOPELESS, YUSEI!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.277
IT'S NOT.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.145
AKIZA AND I
HATCHED A SECRET PLAN

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.880
BEFORE SHE
WENT OUT.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.215
(THINKING)
COME ON, AKIZA.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.417
JUST WAIT FOR
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.486
Akiza: GO LEVEL
1 GLOW-UP BULB,

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:55.322
TUNE WITH LEVEL 7
STAR SIPHON TOKEN!

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:56.323
NO WAY!

00:00:56.323 --> 00:00:57.357
IS IT...?

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.660
THIS ONE'S
FOR YOU, YUSEI!

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.664
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE STARDUST DRAGON!

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.566
♪

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.867
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.368
STARDUST
DRAGON?

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.037
GO,
THUNDER UNICORN!

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:14.207
ATTACK WITH
SUPER CHARGER BOLT!

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.810
AAH!

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.613
I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2!

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.848
NOW BY REMOVING
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.550
FOR EVERY SPEED
SPELL IN MY HAND,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.353
YOU TAKE 800
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.488
AND THAT'S JUST ENOUGH
TO FINISH YOU OFF, SO--

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:30.857
I ACTIVATE THE
TRAP WICKED REBIRTH!

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:31.692
WHAT?

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:34.027
NOW BY PAYING
800 LIFE POINTS

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.198
I CAN REVIVE A SYNCHRO
MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:41.068
RETURN TO
THE FIELD...!

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:44.237
STARDUST
DRAGON!

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.607
(ANDRE THINKING) SHE TRICKED
ME INTO USING MY SPEED COUNTERS

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.075
AND SET THE
STAGE FOR YUSEI

00:01:48.075 --> 00:01:50.577
WITH THAT STARDUST
DRAGON AT THE SAME TIME.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.080
TALK ABOUT TAKING
ONE FOR THE TEAM.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.214
Akiza: I'M
SORRY, YUSEI.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.316
I TRIED MY VERY BEST,
BUT I FAILED YOU.

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:57.517
Bruno: HOW COULD
YOU HAVE FAILED?

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.520
WE HAVEN'T LOST
ANYTHING YET!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.557
Yusei: AND THANKS TO
YOUR SACRIFICE, AKIZA,

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.892

AS ONE OF ITS
TOP CONTENDERS

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.761
IS NOW TEETERING ON
THE EDGE OF ELIMINATION!

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.265
IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT THEY
COULD COME UP WITH A COMEBACK?

00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:21.668
THAT'S THE QUESTION DUELISTS
AND DUEL DEVOTEES ARE ASKING!

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:24.171
HOWEVER, THE ANSWER
TO THAT INTRIGUING QUERY

00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:25.672
IS FAR FROM
FIGURED OUT!

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.874
AFTER ALL, EVEN THOUGH
YUSEI HAS INHERITED

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:30.644
SPEED COUNTERS AND CARDS
FROM HIS TEAMMATE, AKIZA,

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:33.613
AND EVEN THOUGH HE HAS
HIS MOST MENACING MONSTER,

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.982
THE STARDUST DRAGON,
OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:39.219
HE'S STILL JUST ONE DUELIST
WHO WILL HAVE TO DEFEAT THREE

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.022
IN ORDER TO WRANGLE THE
WIN AWAY FROM TEAM UNICORN!

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:45.225
TALK ABOUT A
TOUGH ROW TO HOE!

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.296
HERE YA GO,
AKIZA...

00:03:51.932 --> 00:03:54.468
THANKS.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.972
I'M SORRY I
COULDN'T DO BETTER.

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.373
IT WAS
TOUGH.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:03.343
EVERY MOVE I MADE
ANDRE HAD A COUNTER FOR.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:04.978
IT WAS ALL I COULD
DO TO KEEP YUSEI'S

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.848
STARDUST DRAGON
OUT ON THE FIELD.

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.549
I KNOW THAT YOU
ALL TOOK A BIG CHANCE

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.485
LETTING ME
ON THE TEAM.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:12.919
AND I KNOW HOW
MUCH YOU GUYS ALL WANT

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.821
TO WIN THIS
GRAND PRIX.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.224
I WASN'T
READY.

00:04:19.226 --> 00:04:20.494
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU WEREN'T READY

00:04:20.494 --> 00:04:23.597
BUT LEMME FILL YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET...

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.398
ME, JACK
AND EVEN YUSEI

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.467
AREN'T READY FOR THIS
GRAND PRIX TOURNEY EITHER!

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.837
THE FACT IS, NO DUELIST
IN THIS CONTEST IS READY.

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.172
IT'S BRAND-NEW
TO EVERYONE SO

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:34.574
WE'RE ALL JUST
LEARNING AS WE GO!

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.644
NOW, C'MON, LET'S
GO CHEER ON YUSEI!

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:41.414
♪

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.883
YOU CAN DO
IT, YUSEI!

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:45.085
GET
HIM!

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:48.588
MC: ANDRE OF TEAM UNICORN
HAS 1300 LIFE POINTS LEFT,

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.891
BUT WAITING IN THE
WINGS ARE BREO AND JEAN

00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.394
WITH 8000 LIFE POINTS
READY IN RESERVES!

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:57.430
I'M NO MAGICIAN AT MATH BUT
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.966
THAT MEANS FOR TEAM
5D'S TO FINISH FIRST,

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.336
YUSEI NEEDS TO KNOCK OFF
A TOTAL OF 9300 POINTS,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.606
POSSIBLE BUT BY
NO MEANS ELEMENTARY!

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.543
(YAWN) I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:10.911
IN TEAM 5D'S.

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:13.146
I WAS HOPING THEY'D PUT
UP A BIT MORE OF A FIGHT.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.581
I KNOW WHAT
YOU MEAN, BREO,

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.583
IT'S BEEN AMATEUR
HOUR FROM THE GET GO

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.051
BUT I WILL
GIVE THEM THIS:

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:19.686
WE WASTED
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.921
DURING THAT
LAST MATCH-UP

00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.556
YET
STILL,

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:23.924
AKIZA SOMEHOW
MANAGED TO KEEP

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.660
THAT PESKY STARDUST
DRAGON OUT ON THE FIELD.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.861
QUESTION IS,

00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:30.263
CAN YUSEI TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:32.465
OR WILL HE
CRASH AND BURN?

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.301
IT'S TIME
TO FIND OUT!

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.503
IT'S MY
TURN, ANDRE!

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:39.272
FIRST I SUMMON
OUT MAX WARRIOR!

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:43.310
♪

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.779
AND NEXT I'LL HAVE
MY STARDUST DRAGON

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.581
ATTACK
THUNDER UNICORN!

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:51.117
(ROARS)

00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:53.987
(GRUNTS)

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.288
NOW GO,
MAX WARRIOR!

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:56.857
DIRECT
ATTACK!

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.559
MC: OH MY! WHAT A
FLURRY OF FEROCIOUS ATTACKS!

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.628
AND THIS ONE'S
AIMED RIGHT AT ANDRE!

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:04.364
IF THIS CONNECTS, COUNT
THIS AS A WIN FOR YUSEI!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.966
HE'S
GONNA DO IT!

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.836
ALRIGHT, WE'RE ABOUT
TO BE BACK IN THIS MATCH!

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.038
SORRY BUT DURING THE
BATTLE PHASE OF THE TURN

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.840
IN WHICH THUNDER
UNICORN IS DESTROYED,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.809
I CAN SUMMON IT
BACK IN ATTACK MODE

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.011
AS LONG I REMOVE HIM
FROM PLAY AFTER COMBAT.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:21.181
WHOA, DID YOU
KNOW THUNDER UNICORN

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.616
HAD THAT
SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:06:22.616 --> 00:06:23.717
YEAH,
NOW.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.318
Crow: IT'LL
BE ALRIGHT...

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:28.555
YUSEI'S MONSTER'S HAS A NIFTY
SPECIAL ABILITY OF HIS OWN.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.291
WHEN MAX WARRIOR
ATTACKS YOUR MONSTER THEN,

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:32.425
DURING THE
DAMAGE STEP,

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:34.327
HE GAINS 400
ATTACK POINTS!

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.964
AND THE DAMAGE
STEP BEGINS NOW!

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.733
I GUESS TO
OUTMANEUVER YUSEI

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.769
WE'LL HAVE TO START USING SOME
OF OUR MORE ADVANCED TACTICS.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.271
YES,
INDEED...

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:45.672
IT COST HIM A
MONSTER BUT HE'S

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:48.909
GOTTEN RID OF
THUNDER UNICORN FOR GOOD.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.848
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.517
MC: TEAM 5D'S IS
FINALLY FIGHTING BACK

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:59.619
AND THE CROWD
IS GOING CRAZY!

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.589
AFTER ALL, WITH ANDRE
MOMENTARILY OUT OF MONSTERS

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.325
AND YUSEI STANDING
TALL WITH STARDUST DRAGON,

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:08.628
TEAM 5D'S MAY HAVE JUST
STOLEN THIS MATCH'S MOMENTUM!

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:10.730
BUT CAN THEY
HOLD ON TO IT?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.399
IT'S MY
TURN NOW!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.901
(THINKING) ANDRE'S
STARTING TO RACK UP

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.436
THOSE SPEED
COUNTERS AGAIN.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.438
AND THAT'S BAD
NEWS SEEING AS HOW

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.675
HE STILL HAS A
CERTAIN CARD IN HIS HAND.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.543
I KNOW THAT LOOK,
YUSEI'S WORRIED ABOUT

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.979
THAT END OF
THE STORM SPELL.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.180
END OF THE
STORM HAS THE POWER

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.082
TO CHANGE THE COURSE
OF THIS ENTIRE DUEL.

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:31.051
'CAUSE IF ANDRE
USES IT, IT'LL DESTROY

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.053
ALL THE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD,

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.988
THEN FOR EVERY
MONSTER THAT'S DESTROYED

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:36.823
THE OWNER OF THAT
MONSTER WILL TAKE DAMAGE

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.259
TO THE TUNE
OF 300 POINTS.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.627
WAIT BUT
YUSEI'S THE ONLY ONE

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.696
WITH A MONSTER ON
THE FIELD RIGHT NOW!

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.165
SO HE'D BE THE ONLY
ONE TO TAKE DAMAGE!

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:47.701
ABOUT THOSE ADVANCED
TACTICS WE WERE SPEAKING OF,

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:51.438
I SAY WE START
UNVEILING THEM.

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.106
IT'S TIME TO
SHOW THE WORLD

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:55.241
IF YOU MESS
WITH TEAM UNICORN

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.343

DEMONSTRATE THAT ON

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.513

MEAN INSTEAD OF JUST
