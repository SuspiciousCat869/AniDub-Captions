00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:42.458
DUE TO ITS EFFECT,
BECAUSE I HAVE TWO

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.494
LEVEL 5 OR
ABOVE MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:09:45.494 --> 00:09:48.998
I CAN NOW SUMMON
AN EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!

00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:52.101
AN EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL?!

00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:54.637
THIS IS JUST WHAT
I WAS AFRAID OF.

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:05.614
[BOOM BOOM]

00:10:05.614 --> 00:10:09.918
YOURS IS A FUTURE
THAT WILL BE CLOAKED
IN ETERNAL DARKNESS.

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:24.867
NOW COME FORTH,
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CHACU CHALLHUA!

00:10:28.037 --> 00:10:29.505
UH OH.

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:33.409
[ROARS]

00:10:33.409 --> 00:10:35.010
THAT THING'S INCREDIBLE.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.781
CROW BETTER WATCH OUT.

00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:41.350
ALRIGHTY, CROW,
THIS IS IT.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.885
I DRAW!

00:10:44.553 --> 00:10:45.888
[THINKING]
BUT BEFORE I MAKE A MOVE,

00:10:45.888 --> 00:10:47.589
I BETTER ASSESS
THE SITUATION.

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:49.291
GREIGER'S GOT MORE
LIFE POINTS THAN ME

00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:51.560
AND A GIANT WHALE
PROTECTING HIM.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.429
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO BEACH THAT THING

00:10:53.429 --> 00:10:55.698
BEFORE IT SWALLOWS
MY LIFE POINTS WHOLE.

00:10:55.698 --> 00:11:00.102
I SUMMON BLACKWING FANE
THE STEEL CHAIN!

00:11:04.506 --> 00:11:06.875
IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO ATTACK WITH,

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.511
THEN PERHAPS YOU
SHOULD PULL OVER
AND END THIS DUEL.

00:11:09.545 --> 00:11:12.247
I'M NOT STOPPING
FOR ANYTHING, YA GOT THAT?!

00:11:12.247 --> 00:11:14.850
IN FACT, I'M COMING
STRAIGHT FOR YA!

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.019
BLACKWING, FANE
THE STEEL CHAIN,

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:19.722
ATTACK GREIGER DIRECTLY!

00:11:24.493 --> 00:11:26.829
THAT WAS QUITE THE MOVE,
IT'S JUST TOO BAD THAT

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:29.865
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE LAST ONE YOU
EVER MAKE.

00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:31.300
DON'T THINK SO!

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.603
YOU SEE, IT'S TIME
FOR PART TWO OF MY ATTACK
TO TAKE EFFECT.

00:11:34.603 --> 00:11:35.904
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.107
I MEAN THAT THERE
WAS MORE TO THAT MOVE

00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:39.374
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

00:11:39.374 --> 00:11:41.577
YOU SEE THE REAL PURPOSE
OF MY BLACKWING ATTACKING

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:44.546
WAS TO SWITCH YOUR WHALE
INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:47.282 --> 00:11:49.818
NOW THAT WHALE OF YOURS
COULDN'T EVEN HURT A FLY,

00:11:49.818 --> 00:11:51.887
MUCH LESS ME
OR MY BLACKWING.

00:11:51.887 --> 00:11:53.655
WAY TO GO, CROW!

00:11:53.655 --> 00:11:56.859
NOW I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:11:56.859 --> 00:11:59.795
IT'S MY MOVE THEN! HYAH!

00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:01.730
NOW YOU MAY HAVE STOPPED
MY BEAST FROM ATTACKING

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.166
BUT WHO EVER SAID IT HAD
TO BE IN ATTACK MODE TO

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.501
DEAL OUT DAMAGE?

00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:07.336
MY IMMORTAL
CAN'T BE STOPPED.

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:10.239
I ACTIVATE
CHACU CHALLHUA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:12:10.239 --> 00:12:12.007
WHICH MEANS
YOUR LIFE POINTS GET HIT

00:12:12.007 --> 00:12:15.043
FOR HALF THE AMOUNT
OF ITS DEFENSE POINTS.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.415
THIS WASN'T PART
OF THE PLAN!

00:12:20.415 --> 00:12:21.717
[GRUNTING]

00:12:21.717 --> 00:12:22.885
HANG ON!

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.521
AAH!

00:12:28.924 --> 00:12:32.528
I SUMMON DARKSEA
RESCUE IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:34.196 --> 00:12:38.867
AND NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP BASARA! HA!

00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:40.636
BY PLAYING THIS CARD
I CAN NOW RELEASE

00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:42.237
ONE MONSTER ON THE FIELD
TO DESTROY

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:44.640
A MONSTER WHOSE LEVEL
IS HIGHER.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.276
AND AS AN ADDED BONUS,
NOT ONLY DO YOU LOSE ONE

00:12:47.276 --> 00:12:49.378
OF YOUR MONSTERS,
BUT YOU ALSO LOSE

00:12:49.378 --> 00:12:51.513
800 OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:53.615
I RELEASE MY
DARKSEA RESCUE IN ORDER

00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:57.886
TO DESTROY YOUR
FANE THE STEEL CHAIN!

00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:00.522
HA HA HA!

00:13:03.058 --> 00:13:04.326
WHAT?!

00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:07.095
IF CROW DOESN'T STOP
THIS HE'S DONE FOR!

00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:27.819
Leo: WE GOTTA
FIND YUSEI.

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:30.121
HE'S GOTTA BE AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE.

00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:33.057
WELL JUDGING FROM THAT
ENORMOUS PURPLE WALL,

00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:34.492
I THINK IT'S SAFE
TO SAY THAT WE'RE

00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:36.627
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:38.996
YUSEI, I HOPE
YOU'RE OKAY.

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:40.865
I'D BE MORE WORRIED
ABOUT US BEING OK

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:42.800
WITH TRUDGE'S
DRIVING.

00:13:45.469 --> 00:13:47.004
IF YOU DON'T STOP
THAT ATTACK,

00:13:47.004 --> 00:13:48.439
YOU'LL LOSE, CROW!

00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:49.707
I'M ON IT!

00:13:49.707 --> 00:13:52.410
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
EXPLOSION GUARD WHICH NOT

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.912
ONLY PROTECTS MY MONSTER
FROM YOUR IMMORTAL'S

00:13:54.912 --> 00:13:57.248
SPECIAL ABILITY,
BUT IT ALSO HITS YOU

00:13:57.248 --> 00:13:59.750
FOR 500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:14:02.086 --> 00:14:03.621
NOOOO!

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:12.063
THIS LITTLE PEST IS
REALLY STARTING TO GET
UNDER MY SKIN.

00:14:12.063 --> 00:14:13.397
ALRIGHT.

00:14:13.397 --> 00:14:14.866
MY TURN!

00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:21.205
[THINKING]
OKAY, CROW, IT ALL
COMES DOWN TO THIS.

00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:23.708
YOU'VE ONLY GOT ONE
TRAP LEFT IN YOUR HAND.

00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:27.211
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST YOU,
BUT THEY'VE BEEN AGAINST
YOU YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:30.848
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP NOW;
YOU OWE IT TO THE KIDS.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:32.416
IT'S TIME TO
DRAW A WINNER.

00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:35.186
HERE GOES EVERYTHING.

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:43.027
JUST WHAT I
WAS HOPING FOR.

00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:45.229
NOW I CAN GO AND LAY
DOWN A FACEDOWN

00:14:45.229 --> 00:14:48.499
AND THEN SUMMON BLACKWING
BLIZZARD THE FAR NORTH!

00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:50.568
[CHIRPS]

00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:52.470
AND NOW THAT I'VE ADDED
A LITTLE OFFENSE

00:14:52.503 --> 00:14:54.572
TO MY FIELD, I THINK I'LL
BALANCE IT OUT BY ADDING

00:14:54.572 --> 00:14:59.343
THE DEFENSIVE ABILITIES
OF MY BLACKWING
SHURA THE BLUE FLAME.

00:15:03.014 --> 00:15:05.349
NEXT, I TUNE MY
BLIZZARD THE FAR NORTH,

00:15:05.349 --> 00:15:07.818
FANE THE STEEL,
AND SHURA THE BLUE FLAME

00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:12.757
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
BLACKWING SILVER WIND
THE ASCENDANT!

00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:20.865
WELCOME TO THE GAME!

00:15:27.705 --> 00:15:30.207
Computer: BLACKWING SILVER WIND
THE ASCENDANT IS A LEVEL 8

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:33.277
DARK ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
WITH 2800 ATTACK POINTS

00:15:33.277 --> 00:15:35.846
AND 2000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:15:35.846 --> 00:15:37.982
THAT'S QUITE THE BEAST;
IT'S JUST TOO BAD

00:15:37.982 --> 00:15:40.017
MY IMMORTAL'S SPECIAL
ABILITY WILL BE KEEPING

00:15:40.017 --> 00:15:42.353
YOUR SILVER WIND
ON THE SIDELINES.

00:15:42.353 --> 00:15:45.122
FINE BY ME, BECAUSE THAT
ALLOWS ME TO COUNTER

00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:47.858
YOUR MOVE WITH
A SPECIAL ABILITY OF MY OWN.

00:15:47.858 --> 00:15:50.261
SINCE MY FEATHERED FRIEND
COULDN'T BATTLE THIS TURN,

00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:52.697
I CAN NOW DESTROY
UP TO TWO MONSTERS WHOSE

00:15:52.697 --> 00:15:57.034
DEFENSE POINTS ARE
LESS THAN SILVER WIND'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:57.034 --> 00:15:58.202
THEN THAT MEANS...

00:15:58.202 --> 00:15:59.537
YOUR IMMORTAL'S HISTORY,

00:15:59.537 --> 00:16:02.940
AND THIS SHADOW DUEL
IS ABOUT TO COME TO END!

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.242
GO, PERFECT STORM!

00:16:07.044 --> 00:16:08.479
PLEASE HELP.

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:09.780
YOU MUSTN'T DO THIS.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.982
WHO'RE THEY?

00:16:10.982 --> 00:16:14.352
PLEASE HELP US GET
BACK TO OUR VILLAGE.

00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:16.487
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
VILLAGE?

00:16:16.487 --> 00:16:18.289
ENOUGH STALLING, CROW.

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:20.057
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FINISH YOUR MOVE,

00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:21.692
THEN ALLOW ME TO.

00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:23.494
BUT DON'T YOU SEE
THOSE KIDS UP THERE?

00:16:23.527 --> 00:16:26.630
ALL I SEE IS
THE FINISH LINE, CROW!

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.698
BUT, GREIGER!

00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:28.899
BUT NOTHING!

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:29.900
THERE'S KIDS UP THERE!

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.535
PLEASE, JUST LOOK
FOR YOURSELF!

00:16:31.535 --> 00:16:33.604
FINE, YUSEI.

00:16:33.604 --> 00:16:36.774
GREIGER, IT'S US.
PLEASE HELP.

00:16:36.774 --> 00:16:38.609
[CRYING]

00:16:38.609 --> 00:16:39.810
OHH!

00:16:43.948 --> 00:16:46.917
HOW CAN THIS...
HOW CAN THIS BE?

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.319
GREIGER!

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:50.087
WHY ARE THERE PEOPLE
FROM MY VILLAGE

00:16:50.087 --> 00:16:51.822
INSIDE THIS EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL?

00:16:51.822 --> 00:16:55.359
[LAUGHING]

00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:56.494
SO HE KNOWS THEM?

00:16:56.494 --> 00:16:58.996
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO BE CERTAIN.

00:16:58.996 --> 00:17:01.165
GREIGER, IS THAT
YOUR FAMILY?

00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:02.633
I'M SURE OF IT NOW.

00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:05.336
THE PEOPLE TRAPPED
INSIDE THIS EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:07.138
ARE MY BROTHER
AND SISTER

00:17:07.138 --> 00:17:09.206
AND PEOPLE
FROM MY VILLAGE.

00:17:09.206 --> 00:17:10.875
THAT MEANS
THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:12.276
ISN'T TO BLAME FOR THIS.

00:17:12.276 --> 00:17:16.380
IT WAS THE DARK SIGNERS
WHO TOOK EVERYTHING
AWAY FROM ME!

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.483
SO IT'S THE DARK SIGNERS
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:25.423
YES, AND HERE I
WAS BLAMING YOU
AND GOODWIN.

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:28.025
GREIGER! NOW THAT YOU
FIGURED OUT THE TRUTH,

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:31.862
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS DUEL.

00:17:31.862 --> 00:17:34.965
YUSEI, I'M SORRY.

00:17:34.965 --> 00:17:37.368
I'LL FORFEIT THIS
DUEL SO THAT...

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:39.403
Roman:
YOU'LL FORFEIT NOTHING!

00:17:39.403 --> 00:17:42.039
THIS IS NOTHING BUT
A SIGNER TRICK.

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:44.675
THEY ARE YOUR TRUE ENEMY.

00:17:44.675 --> 00:17:50.147
SHOW NO MERCY
AND SEND THEM ALL
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:17:51.749 --> 00:17:53.551
HA HA HA!

00:18:08.183 --> 00:18:11.419
HA HA HA!

00:18:11.419 --> 00:18:12.754
GREIGER!

00:18:12.754 --> 00:18:14.823
I'M AFRAID YOUR TRICKERY
WILL NOT STOP ME

00:18:14.823 --> 00:18:16.825
FROM SENDING YOU
AND THOSE LOYAL TO YOU

00:18:16.825 --> 00:18:18.326
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:20.261
COME ON!

00:18:20.261 --> 00:18:22.931
GET OUT OF MY HEAD
WHOEVER YOU ARE!

00:18:24.199 --> 00:18:25.667
PLEASE, CROW.

00:18:25.667 --> 00:18:28.937
YOU MUST END THIS
DUEL RIGHT AWAY.

00:18:28.937 --> 00:18:31.172
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO RELEASE MY FAMILY

00:18:31.172 --> 00:18:33.741
AND FRIENDS
FROM THEIR PRISON!

00:18:33.741 --> 00:18:36.077
ARE YOU SURE?

00:18:36.077 --> 00:18:39.547
AAH!

00:18:39.547 --> 00:18:40.748
NOT EXACTLY!

00:18:40.748 --> 00:18:42.450
IN FACT IT MIGHT BE
BEST IF I END

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.320
THIS DUEL
RIGHT AWAY.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.823
MY TURN! HYAH!

00:18:48.823 --> 00:18:52.293
I SWITCH CHACU CHALLHUA
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:18:53.361 --> 00:18:55.163
YOU'D BETTER BE
CAREFUL WITH GREIGER.

00:18:55.163 --> 00:18:57.298
HE ISN'T GONNA
HOLD ANYTHING BACK!

00:18:57.298 --> 00:18:58.700
THAT'S RIGHT, CROW.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.470
NOW EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CHACU CHALLHUA, ATTACK!

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.938
NO!

00:19:03.938 --> 00:19:05.740
DON'T GIVE UP...
YOU CAN END THIS DUEL,

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.876
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN!

00:19:07.876 --> 00:19:09.978
HE'S RIGHT... I CAN...

00:19:09.978 --> 00:19:11.546
[THINKING]
AND I WILL!

00:19:11.546 --> 00:19:14.949
GREIGER'S BEAST MIGHT NOT
BE AFFECTED BY MY
TRAPS OR SPELLS,

00:19:14.949 --> 00:19:17.218
BUT HIS OWN
ARE A DIFFERENT STORY.

00:19:17.252 --> 00:19:19.420
THIS SHADOW DUEL
IS OVER!

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.391
IT WILL BE ONCE
I ACTIVATE PARASITE MIND!

00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:25.894
WITH THIS, I CAN GAIN
CONTROL OF A TRAP CARD

00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:29.430
ON YOUR FIELD
AND ACTIVATE ITS EFFECT!

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.701
AND THE TRAP CARD I'M
GONNA BE USING IS BASARA!

00:19:35.637 --> 00:19:37.472
NOW I KNOW YOU'RE
FAMILIAR WITH HOW
