WEBVTT

00:00:01.917 --> 00:00:03.885
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D'S."

00:00:03.885 --> 00:00:05.754
MC: WELCOME BACK
FOR OUR SECOND SEMIFINAL DUEL!

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.057
NOW ENTERING THE ARENA,
THE DUELING DETECTIVE:

00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:10.792
COMMANDER KODA...

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.496
AND HIS OPPONENT:
THE MAGICIAN WITH THE MOVES,

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.599
THE PRESTIDIGITATOR WITH
THE PLAN: THE BLACK ROOOOOSE!

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:21.970
Akiza: I ACTIVATE BLACK ROSE
DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:00:23.872 --> 00:00:24.873
[ROAR]

00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:27.709
[GASP] THAT'S WHAT
I WAS WAITING FOR!

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.613
NOW MY EQUIP SPELL ACTIVATES!

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:39.654
SHE'S A SIGNER!

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.124
EXCELLENT.
3 DOWN AND ONLY
2 MORE TO GO.

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.027
A NICE SPELL...

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:49.998
BUT I STILL HAVE MY TRAP CARD:
ROSE CURSE!

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:54.436
MC: IT'S OVEEEEEER!

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.204
THE BLACK ROSE IS OUR WINNER!

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.807
Koda: I DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING...

00:00:59.307 --> 00:01:01.776
MC: SHE'LL MOVE ON TO THE FINALS
TO TAKE ON YUSEI FUUUUUUDOOOO!

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.314
THAT BLACK ROSE
IS A ONE-WOMAN
WRECKING MACHINE!

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:08.116
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:11.887

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

00:02:17.752 --> 00:02:19.154
AFTER PICKING APART
COMMANDER KODA,

00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:21.690
THE BLACK ROSE
WILL NOW BE MOVING ON

00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:23.959
TO FACE THE SATELLITE'S
VERY OWN YUSEI FUDO

00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:26.795
IN THE FORTUNE CUP'S
FINAL BATTLE.

00:02:27.862 --> 00:02:29.264
WHO WILL WIN, WHO WILL GO HOME,

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:31.333
STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT...

00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:34.135
EVERYTHING OK,
AKIZA?...

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:36.004
I'M FINE.

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:40.108
YOUR ARM!

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:41.242
YOU ALSO HAVE A MARK?!

00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:43.912
STAY AWAY FROM ME!

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:52.253
SO WHAT'S YOUR DEAL
WITH THESE MARKS
OF OURS?

00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.922
WHEN YOU SAW MINE
THE OTHER DAY...

00:02:53.922 --> 00:02:54.923
YOU REALLY
FREAKED OUT.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:57.292
YEAH WELL, THIS MARK
HAS BROUGHT ME
NOTHING BUT PAIN,

00:02:57.826 --> 00:02:59.961
SO WHAT GOOD CAN COME FROM
HAVING ANOTHER ONE AROUND.

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.129
YOU GOT THAT?

00:03:02.697 --> 00:03:03.698
IT'S DANGEROUS.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.500
SO JUST KEEP AWAY.

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:07.869
Leo: YUSEI!

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:08.937
Luna: THERE
YOU ARE.

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:11.206
WE NEED YA' TO SETTLE
AN ARGUMENT, WHO...?...

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:12.907
THE WITCH!

00:03:12.974 --> 00:03:14.209
Yusei: LEO...
SHE'S NOT A WITCH.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.844
Leo: SORRY, FORCE OF HABIT.

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.849
Lazar: WHAT'S GOING ON
BACK HERE,

00:03:22.017 --> 00:03:23.251
EVERYBODY GETTING ALONG NICELY?

00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:26.454
QUITE THE DUEL JUST NOW,
MISS AKIZA, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:03:28.256 --> 00:03:29.791
BEFORE THE FINAL ROUND
GETS UNDERWAY...

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:32.460
DIRECTOR GOODWIN
HAS A FEW THINGS

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:34.396
HE'D LIKE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.231
I'D SAY MORE,
BUT IT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.100
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME
AND WE'LL...

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.602
AKIZA MUST REST.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:44.506
AND YOU ARE...?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.941
DON'T PLAY DUMB
LAZAR.

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:49.010
YOUR REPUTATION
PRECEDES YOU.

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:51.579
WE BOTH KNOW
YOU DON'T
LIKE SURPRISES

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.881
SO LET'S NOT
WASTE TIME

00:03:52.881 --> 00:03:53.882
PRETENDING
YOU HAVEN'T

00:03:53.948 --> 00:03:55.350
DONE YOUR
HOMEWORK
LIKE I HAVE.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.551
[CHUCKLES]

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:58.620
STAY WAY FROM AKIZA.

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:01.623
AND TELL
THE DIRECTOR
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:03.124
IN WHAT
HE HAS TO SAY.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.226
NOW EXCUSE US.

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:23.044
WELL, THE DIRECTOR WILL NOT
BE PLEASED WITH THIS AT ALL.

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.480
WHAT'S THE STORY?

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:27.415
GOODWIN... WHAT'S HE WANT
WITH AKIZA?

00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:29.718
DID YOU NOT
GET THE MEMO?

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.821
I COULD HAVE SWORN WE MEANT
TO KEEP YOU POSTED.

00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.356
SO SORRY ABOUT THAT...

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:43.164
THAT AKIZA
CREEPS ME OUT.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.700
SHE SEEMS SO SAD...

00:04:47.736 --> 00:04:48.737
SOMETHING WRONG?

00:04:49.637 --> 00:04:50.638
UM...

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.340
MY ARM KINDA STINGS
OR SOMETHING...

00:04:53.608 --> 00:04:54.909
WHENEVER THAT GIRL
LOOKS AT ME...

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:58.580
I FEEL ALL WEIRD
AND STUFF.

00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:17.799
Sayer: AKIZA,
ABOUT EARLIER...

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.901
LOOK, IT'S JUST...
WE'VE EXPOSED THE MOVEMENT

00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:21.870
BY COMING
TO THIS TOURNAMENT,

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:23.438
AND PEOPLE WILL
WANT TO KNOW MORE,

00:05:23.805 --> 00:05:25.406
WE KNEW THAT RISK
GOING IN TO THIS.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.008
IN FACT
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:29.177
MIGHT CONTINUE
TO APPROACH YOU

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.179
AND TRY TO PRY
INFORMATION FROM YOU.

00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:34.349
Akiza: OK, BUT...
I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.952
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO BABY-SIT ME
OR ANYTHING, SAYER.

00:05:39.788 --> 00:05:41.055
I'M NOT GONNA
BETRAY THE MOVEMENT

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:42.791
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:44.826
YOU GUYS ARE LIKE
MY FAMILY NOW.

00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:48.229
NO ONE COULD EVER MAKE ME
TURN AGAINST ALL OF YOU.

00:05:49.063 --> 00:05:50.665
I'M SO RELIEVED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:53.635
GOODWIN AND HIS PEOPLE
ARE PART OF THE ORDER
OF ILLIASTER,

00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:55.670
A GROUP SEEKING
TO RESURRECT A FORCE

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.238
KNOWN AS THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:05:57.972 --> 00:05:59.240
IF ALLOWED TO RETURN,
THE DRAGON

00:05:59.808 --> 00:06:01.276
WILL BRING THE WORLD
TO ITS KNEES.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.112
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN...
HE WHO RULES THE SKY

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:07.348
HAS GIVEN THE MEMBERS
OF THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
SPECIAL POWERS...

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:09.250
WE ARE HIS CHOSEN.

00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:11.653
WE WILL STOP GOODWIN
AND LEAD THE WORLD

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.221
DOWN THE RIGHT PATH.

00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:14.722
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.991
YES, WELL,
SPEAKING OF TIME...

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:19.527
IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR YOUR DUEL WITH YUSEI.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:21.596
HE MIGHT BE
A MEMBER OF ILLIASTER,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.331
WE'RE NOT SURE YET.

00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:25.533
EITHER WAY, IT IS CRUCIAL
THAT YOU DEFEAT HIM.

00:06:27.368 --> 00:06:28.803
ONCE YOU GET THROUGH
THIS SATELLITE,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.572
YOU CAN BRING
JACK ATLAS TO HIS KNEES.

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.508
AND THEN THE CROWD'S JEERS
WILL CHANGE TO CHEERS,

00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:35.577
AND OUR TIME
WILL FINALLY COME.

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:37.645
YOU'RE READY, AREN'T YOU?

00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:39.147
OF COURSE.

00:06:41.482 --> 00:06:43.218
[THINKING] AND MAYBE THEN
I CAN RID MYSELF

00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:45.153
OF THIS POWER I POSSESS...

00:06:53.428 --> 00:06:54.629
WHY DID THIS MARK CHOOSE ME?

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.332
WHAT DID I DO TO DESERVE IT?

00:06:57.732 --> 00:07:00.001
I MUST FIND A WAY
TO RID MYSELF OF ITS CONTROL

00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:02.170
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!

00:07:17.098 --> 00:07:18.933
[THINKING] AKIZA...
WITH THE POWER OF MY DECK,

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:20.968
I KNOW I CAN HELP YOU OVERCOME

00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:22.370
THE HATE AND ANGER YOU FEEL...

00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:26.240
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HELPED.

00:07:26.908 --> 00:07:28.910
YOU SAY YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME
BECAUSE OF MY MARK...

00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:31.245
BECAUSE YOUR MARK HAS
CAUSED YOU NOTHING BUT PAIN.

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:33.548
BUT WHATEVER THESE MARKS ARE...

00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:35.449
THEY CONNECT
ALL OF US SOMEHOW...

00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:37.285
AND I'M SURE
GOODWIN KNOWS WHY.

00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:40.688
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME THOSE
CHARACTERS WHO HANG AROUND YOU

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:42.189
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, TOO.

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:44.559
EVERYONE IS OUT
TO USE US SOMEHOW

00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:46.227
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:48.296
WE'VE GOTTA COME TOGETHER...

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:49.897
LIKE A TEAM OR SOMETHING.

00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.632
THAT INCLUDES YOU, AKIZA...

00:07:52.433 --> 00:07:54.035
I NEED TO USE
OUR DUEL TO REMOVE

00:07:54.135 --> 00:07:55.469
THAT MASK
YOU'RE HIDING BEHIND...

00:07:56.404 --> 00:07:58.773
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I HAVE TO FIGURE YOU OUT,

00:07:59.807 --> 00:08:01.676
WHO YOU ARE,
WHAT MAKES YOU TICK...

00:08:03.244 --> 00:08:04.845
I DON'T WANNA
HAVE TO GO FULL FORCE...

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:07.448
BUT IF IT MEANS
TEARING DOWN THAT WALL

00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:08.783
YOU'VE BUILT AROUND YOURSELF,

00:08:09.584 --> 00:08:10.585
I'LL DO IT.

00:08:11.619 --> 00:08:12.887
AND THEN... AFTER THIS BATTLE...

00:08:14.822 --> 00:08:17.058
I NEED TO GET JACK
ON OUR SIDE TOO...

00:08:28.436 --> 00:08:29.770
IT'S TIME SAYER.

00:08:36.677 --> 00:08:38.079
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
AT A POINT

00:08:38.212 --> 00:08:40.414
WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOUR POWER IS
GOING TO TAKE OVER,

00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:42.783
JUST REMEMBER THAT
THIS ENERGY STABILIZER
IN YOUR HAIR

00:08:43.284 --> 00:08:44.285
WILL LIMIT YOUR POWERS...

00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:46.520
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
IS IN YOUR HANDS...

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.389
WE'RE ALL COUNTING
ON YOU AKIZA...

00:08:48.422 --> 00:08:49.423
WHAT ABOUT MY MASK?

00:08:49.924 --> 00:08:51.759
TAKE IT BUT
YOU WON'T NEED IT.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:58.366
BEAT THE FREAK!

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.401
THIS IS A TOURNAMENT,
NOT A CREEP FEST!

00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:02.403
NOBODY LIKES YOU, WITCH!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.839
MY GOODNESS... THEY SAY
SUCH MEAN THINGS.

00:09:06.073 --> 00:09:07.875
WHY ARE THEY SO CRUEL?
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.845
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND
HER SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:12.980
AND WHEN PEOPLE
DON'T UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING THEY SEE,

00:09:13.314 --> 00:09:14.715
THEY TEND TO BE
AFRAID OF IT.

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:16.651
SO... IF EVERYONE'S
SO AFRAID OF HER,

00:09:17.284 --> 00:09:18.886
WHY ARE THEY HERE
TO WATCH HER DUEL?

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.689
THAT'S EASY LEO...
THEY'RE ALL HOPING
THAT SHE'LL LOSE.

00:09:22.523 --> 00:09:24.158
SEE WHEN PEOPLE ARE
AFRAID OF SOMETHING...

00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:25.693
THEY DON'T LIKE
TO BE ALONE

00:09:26.227 --> 00:09:27.561
SO SOMETIMES
THEY'LL BAND TOGETHER

00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:29.630
HOPING TO SEE
THAT SOMETHING FEEL BAD

00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:31.165
WHICH MAKES THEM
FEEL GOOD.

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:34.602
WOW, TALK ABOUT SEEING
THE GLASS HALF EMPTY TANNER.

00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:39.240
Lazar: I TRIED TO BRING
THE GIRL TO YOU, DIRECTOR,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.909
BUT THAT ARCADIA BUNCH WOULDN'T
LET HER OUT OF THEIR SIGHTS.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.612
THEY MAY PROVE TO BE
A PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD.

00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:47.915
Goodwin: HMPH!...
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THOSE DELUDED FOOLS.

00:09:48.616 --> 00:09:50.384
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE
VERY MUCH INFLUENCE.

00:09:51.052 --> 00:09:53.020
STILL... THEY DID MANAGE
TO MAKE HER THEIR PUPPET.

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.090
THE SITUATION IS IRONIC
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

00:09:57.058 --> 00:09:59.093
THE BLACK ROSE IS A MEMBER
OF THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.228
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT
OPPOSES US.

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.799
AND YET, SHE'S
GOING TO DO US A FAVOR.

00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:09.570
ACCORDING TO
ZIGZIX'S READINGS,

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:11.806
SHE'S MORE THAN CAPABLE
OF GETTING YUSEI

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:13.140
TO REVEAL HIS TRUE POWER.

00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:14.542
THAT BEING SAID...

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:16.610
I DO HOPE YUSEI MANAGES
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:10:18.012 --> 00:10:19.613
I WANT TO SEE IT, LAZAR.
DON'T YOU?

00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:23.250
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
JACK'S RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND

00:10:24.418 --> 00:10:26.020
CLASH WITH YUSEI'S
STARDUST DRAGON AGAIN?

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:29.557
I WANT TO WITNESS THE ENERGY
SUCH A CLASH CREATES.

00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:32.193
I WANT TO FEEL THE POWER.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.862
HUH! I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
SO MUCH POWER,

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:37.231
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HANDLE IT.

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:40.167
[THINKING] YUSEI...

00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:42.336
YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE
AN INCREDIBLE DUELIST...

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.171
BUT THIS BLACK ROSE
HAS A POWER

00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:46.340
UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE
EVER ENCOUNTERED...

00:10:47.007 --> 00:10:48.209
SO BE SURE
NOT TO LOSE,

00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:50.044
'CAUSE I WANT
TO SEE GOODWIN'S FACE

00:10:50.644 --> 00:10:53.214
WHEN I USE THE DRAGON'S
POWER FOR MYSELF...

00:10:56.484 --> 00:10:57.485
YEAH...!

00:10:57.952 --> 00:10:59.286
IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR THE FINAL!

00:11:00.354 --> 00:11:01.555
THE WINNER OF THIS NEXT MATCH

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:03.557
GETS TO GO ON
TO THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN...

00:11:04.592 --> 00:11:05.960
A ONE-ON-ONE
NO-HOLDS-BARRED DUEL

00:11:06.894 --> 00:11:08.896
WITH THE MASTER OF FASTER
HIMSELF... JACK ATLAS!...

00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:14.034
OUR FIRST FINALIST
IS THE MYSTERIOUS
BLACK ROSE... AKIZA!

00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:17.972
[CROWD BOOING]

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:20.207
GO HOME, WITCH!

00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:22.109
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE,
YOU FREAK!

00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:26.280
MC: CHALLENGING HER IS
THE SHOOTING STAR FROM
THE SATELLITE SECTOR...

00:11:26.914 --> 00:11:28.616
YUSEI FUDO!

00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:41.495
COME ON, YUSEI!
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:11:41.996 --> 00:11:42.997
BRING IT ON!

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.131
THIS'LL BE EXCITING.

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:47.768
BE CAREFUL.
VERY CAREFUL.

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:53.440
[THINKING] SO YOU'RE
SCARED TOO, KURIBON?...

00:11:54.141 --> 00:11:56.310
SOMETHING BAD IS GOING
TO HAPPEN, ISN'T IT?...

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.714
[THINKING] AKIZA...
THIS IS OUR MOMENT.

00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:03.417
SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY
AND INTRODUCE THE WORLD

00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:06.687
TO THE TRUE POWER
OF THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:12:09.156 --> 00:12:11.025
MC: EVERY CARD HAS LED US
TO THIS MOMENT!

00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:13.794
THE FINAL ROUND OF THE FORTUNE
CUP IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:16.730
Both: LET'S DO THIS!

00:12:31.983 --> 00:12:33.384
MC: AND NOW... GET READY
FOR THE FINAL ROUND

00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:34.385
OF THE FORTUNE CUP!

00:12:35.386 --> 00:12:36.421
HOPE YOU'RE READY!

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:41.826
THE FIRST MOVE IS MINE.

00:12:42.827 --> 00:12:43.828
I DRAW.

00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:47.131
I SUMMON WALL OF IVY
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:12:50.168 --> 00:12:51.402
NEXT I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.071
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:54.472
MY MOVE THEN.

00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:56.774
AND I COUNTER
BY PLAYING
SPEED WARRIOR

00:12:57.475 --> 00:12:58.543
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.015
ON THE TURN
SPEED WARRIOR
IS SUMMONED,

00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:05.950
ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE DOUBLED.

00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:12.190
SPEED WARRIOR SHRED
THAT WALL OF IVY!

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:15.493
YOU HAD BETTER
BE CAREFUL YUSEI,

00:13:16.227 --> 00:13:17.662
BECAUSE WHEN MY
IVY WALL IS DESTROYED

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:19.931
ONE OF MY IVY TOKENS
TAKES ROOT

00:13:20.164 --> 00:13:21.499
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:33.077
MC: WE'VE SEEN THE BLACK ROSE
USE THIS STRATEGY BEFORE...

00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.613
IT REALLY CREATED PROBLEMS
FOR COMMANDER KODA

00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:37.215
AND SIR RANDSBORG.

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:40.118
WHAT KIND OF HAVOC
WILL SHE WREAK ON YUSEI!?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.621
THESE COULD BE
A PROBLEM...

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:46.057
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:13:46.357 --> 00:13:47.358
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:49.260
NOW THEN.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.495
REMEMBER THAT LAST ROUND?...

00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:51.863
WHEN I SUMMONED WALL OF IVY

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.365
ONLY TO HAVE YOU TEAR IT DOWN
WITH YOUR SPEED WARRIOR?

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:56.734
WELL, I'M PLAYING
THE CURSED IVY TRAP CARD

00:13:57.468 --> 00:13:59.270
TO BRING MY
WALL OF IVY BACK.

00:14:00.872 --> 00:14:03.274
IN CASE YOU CAN'T TELL,
I'VE GOT KIND OF A GREEN THUMB.

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.978
OH AND BY THE WAY,
I REALLY SHOULD THANK YOU,

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:09.881
'CAUSE CURSED IVY GETS
POWERED UP BY MY IVY WALL...

00:14:10.982 --> 00:14:12.583
SO NOW IT'S STRONGER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

00:14:13.484 --> 00:14:14.953
[THINKING] I KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING...

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:15.987
SHE'S TRYING TO INCREASE

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.689
THE NUMBER OF IVY TOKENS
ON MY FIELD.

00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:20.391
'CAUSE WHEN THAT LITTLE
SPROUT GETS DESTROYED,

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:22.327
I'LL TAKE 300 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:24.829
AND IF SHE GETS MORE
ON MY FIELD...

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.197
YOU GONNA
STAND AROUND AND THINK

00:14:26.631 --> 00:14:28.132
OR ARE YOU GONNA DUEL?

00:14:30.134 --> 00:14:31.936
IT'S BEEN A RELATIVELY
MELLOW DUEL SO FAR...

00:14:33.538 --> 00:14:35.773
EVEN THE CROWD SEEMS TO HAVE
SIMMERED DOWN A BIT, BUT...

00:14:36.374 --> 00:14:39.477
COULD WE SIMPLY BE EXPERIENCING
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM?

00:14:42.814 --> 00:14:44.015
AND I'M SENDING
SPEED WARRIOR

00:14:44.415 --> 00:14:45.583
TO MY GRAVEYARD...

00:14:47.285 --> 00:14:49.587
IN ORDER
TO SUMMON
MY TURRET WARRIOR!

00:14:52.256 --> 00:14:53.257
AND DUE
TO MY TURRET'S

00:14:53.491 --> 00:14:54.492
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:14:54.592 --> 00:14:55.827
IT NOW GAINS
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:57.562
OF MY SPEED WARRIOR.

00:15:00.898 --> 00:15:02.100
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR WALL OF IVY

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.634
IS ABOUT
TO GET UPROOTED!

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:05.770
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER IVY TOKEN

00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:08.606
IS ABOUT TO SHOOT UP
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD.

00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:16.447
TURRET WARRIOR ATTACK!

00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:20.084
BY DESTROYING
MY WALL OF IVY,

00:15:20.918 --> 00:15:22.754
YOU'VE ALSO TAKEN OUT
THE CURSED IVY TRAP CARD.

00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:25.890
AND WHEN MY CURSED IVY
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:26.491 --> 00:15:29.961
IT SUMMONS 2 MORE IVY TOKENS
TO YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD...

00:15:34.165 --> 00:15:34.966
[THINKING] MAN,
THESE THINGS

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:36.367
ARE GROWING
OUT OF CONTROL...

00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:37.969
YOU GOT ANYTHING ELSE
FOR ME?

00:15:39.103 --> 00:15:40.104
NO... I'M DONE FOR NOW.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:42.640
THAT'S DISAPPOINTING.
I DRAW!

00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:45.143
AND FROM MY HAND...
I'M ACTIVATING

00:15:45.843 --> 00:15:47.111
THE SEED OF DECEPTION
SPELL CARD.

00:15:48.613 --> 00:15:50.782
Duel runner computer: SEED OF
DECEPTION IS A SPELL CARD

00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:52.850
THAT LETS YOU SPECIAL SUMMON
A LEVEL 2 OR BELOW

00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.019
PLANT TYPE MONSTER
FROM YOUR HAND.

00:15:56.521 --> 00:15:58.289
Akiza: SO WITH THE POWER
OF THIS SPELL CARD

00:15:58.356 --> 00:16:01.225
I SUMMON OUT DARK VERGER
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:06.531
BUT NOW I'M GOING TO DO
A LITTLE LANDSCAPING

00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.766
TO MAKE ROOM
FOR SOMETHING STRONGER...

00:16:10.835 --> 00:16:11.836
I ADVANCE SUMMON

00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:14.005
ROSE TENTACLES
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.381
THE BEST THING
ABOUT ROSES

00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:25.850
IS THAT THEIR THORNS
ARE AS DANGEROUS

00:16:26.284 --> 00:16:27.418
AS THEIR PETALS
ARE BEAUTIFUL

00:16:28.152 --> 00:16:29.921
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE
THAT FIRSTHAND!

00:16:30.822 --> 00:16:32.990
GO ROSE RETALIATION!

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.502
MC: YUSEI ONLY TOOK 100 POINTS
OF DAMAGE FROM THAT ATTACK...

00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:47.271
BUT I'VE GOT A FEELING
THE BLACK ROSE'S STRATEGY

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:49.207
IS ABOUT TO BLOSSOM
INTO SOMETHING

00:16:49.507 --> 00:16:51.109
FAR MORE TERRIFYING...

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.482
THAT ATTACK WAS
JUST THE BEGINNING,

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:09.550
SO GET READY FOR MY ROSE
TENTACLES' SPECIAL ABILITY

00:17:09.717 --> 00:17:10.985
TO SQUEEZE YOU
INTO SUBMISSION...

00:17:11.452 --> 00:17:13.855
NOW YOU TAKE DAMAGE FOR THE 4
IVY TOKENS ON YOUR FIELD!

00:17:15.256 --> 00:17:16.257
THIS MIGHT HURT!

00:17:16.824 --> 00:17:17.825
THAT'S SOME MOVE.

00:17:18.326 --> 00:17:19.560
SO SHE'S GONNA
ATTACK, 4 TIMES?

00:17:20.962 --> 00:17:23.364
THIS IS THE PART OF THE BATTLE
THAT I ENJOY THE MOST

00:17:23.364 --> 00:17:24.565
BECAUSE NOW I GET TO WATCH

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.534
THE POWER OF MY ROSE TENTACLES
AND IVY TOKENS

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:28.503
BLEED YOUR LIFE POINTS DRY.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.405
MC: INCREDIBLE!...
AKIZA'S MANAGED TO PLANT

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.808
4 IVY TOKENS
ON YUSEI'S FIELD...

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:37.345
WHICH MEANS SHE CAN UNLEASH
A QUADRUPLE DOSE OF DESTRUCTION.

00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.915
AND WITH EACH ATTACK,
YUSEI'S GONNA TAKE
600 POINTS OF DAMAGE...

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.285
WOAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THE FANS
ARE RUNNING FOR THE EXITS,

00:17:44.685 --> 00:17:45.686
AND WHO COULD BLAME THEM,

00:17:46.354 --> 00:17:48.890
ESPECIALLY AFTER WITNESSING
THE BLACK ROSE'S
DESTRUCTIVE POWERS

00:17:49.423 --> 00:17:50.424
IN HER LAST 2 DUELS.

00:17:50.992 --> 00:17:53.294
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE
IN YUSEI'S BOOTS RIGHT NOW.

00:17:55.196 --> 00:17:56.197
OH, NO...

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.632
WELL, GUYS...
NICE KNOWIN' YA.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.700
WE SHOULD TAKE COVER!

00:18:01.168 --> 00:18:03.204
LET'S SEE IF PEOPLE KEEP
PICKING ON ME AFTER THIS...

00:18:04.505 --> 00:18:05.840
GET READY YUSEI!

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:17.084
HERE'S ONE MORE!
ATTACK!

00:18:23.925 --> 00:18:25.126
Lazar: WE FINALLY HAVE SOMEONE

00:18:25.593 --> 00:18:27.061
WHO CAN PUSH YUSEI
TO HIS LIMITS!...

00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:31.198
I'M GETTING SOME POPCORN.
ANYONE INTERESTED?

00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:35.703
[THINKING] THAT'S RIGHT,
AKIZA...

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.472
TAKE ALL THAT LONELINESS
AND SUFFERING YOU'VE ENDURED...

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.043
USE IT... THERE'S
NO NEED TO BE AFRAID...

00:18:45.746 --> 00:18:46.847
IS HE OK?

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:50.418
[THINKING] PLEASE...
HANG IN THERE, YUSEI...

00:18:51.786 --> 00:18:53.120
YOU'RE NOT
GIVING IN YET?...

00:18:55.089 --> 00:18:57.191
WELL!...MAYBE THIS'LL
CHANGE YOUR MIND?!

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:07.768
[THINKING] I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE CARES ABOUT WINNING...

00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:09.604
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
DRIVING HER...

00:19:10.304 --> 00:19:12.106
I KNOW THE WORLD
HAS BEEN CRUEL TO YOU

00:19:12.139 --> 00:19:13.541
BECAUSE OF THE MARK
YOU HAVE AKIZA

00:19:14.141 --> 00:19:15.776
BUT YOU HAVE TO REALIZE
THAT RETALIATING

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.812
WON'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD...

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.452
I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS...
NOW ATTACKKKKK!

00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:37.865
LOOK AT YOU UP THERE.
HOPELESS AND ALONE.

00:19:38.933 --> 00:19:40.935
NO ONE CAN HELP YOU,
AND NO ONE WANTS TO.

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:42.870
NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.839
TO BE ME IN THIS
CRUEL COLD WORLD.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.346
[THINKING] SHE'S SMILING;
SHE'S ACTUALLY
ENJOYING MY PAIN...

00:20:01.022 --> 00:20:03.190
MC: WHOA!...AKIZA'S ATTACK
HAS THE STADIUM IN PANIC!...

00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:05.593
THE PLACE IS
IN COMPLETE CHAOS...

00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:07.595
JUST LIKE WE THOUGHT,
AKIZA IS...

00:20:08.229 --> 00:20:08.896
A WITCH...

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.231
IT'S TRUE.

00:20:11.298 --> 00:20:12.299
THAT GIRL'S
A WITCH!

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.402
CHEATER!
SHE'S DANGEROUS!

00:20:27.948 --> 00:20:29.150
AKIZA...
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

00:20:31.452 --> 00:20:32.653
I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND

00:20:32.653 --> 00:20:34.088
AND I'M GONNA USE
EVERY CARD I HAVE

00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:35.089
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:36.557
AND I'LL START
BY PLAYING

00:20:36.857 --> 00:20:38.626
SHIELD WARRIOR
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:20:41.162 --> 00:20:42.396
NEXT, I PLACE
2 CARDS FACEDOWN

00:20:43.064 --> 00:20:44.231
AND END MY TURN.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.041
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
IT NOW...

00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:56.343
WHAT MAKES
YOU TICK AKIZA...

00:20:57.712 --> 00:21:00.014
BECAUSE OF
ALL THAT PEOPLE
HAVE PUT YOU THROUGH...

00:21:03.718 --> 00:21:04.719
YOU ENJOY IT.

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:06.220
ENJOY WHAT?

00:21:06.587 --> 00:21:07.788
YOU ENJOY
PEOPLE'S MISERY.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.725
YOU LIKE
HOW IT MAKES
PEOPLE FEEL.

00:21:12.326 --> 00:21:13.794
YOU LIKE
HOW IT MAKES
YOU FEEL.

00:21:15.096 --> 00:21:16.097
YOU'RE RIGHT...

00:21:17.264 --> 00:21:18.666
AND FOR THE REST
OF THIS DUEL...

00:21:20.101 --> 00:21:23.070
I REALLY PLAN
ON ENJOYING MYSELF...
