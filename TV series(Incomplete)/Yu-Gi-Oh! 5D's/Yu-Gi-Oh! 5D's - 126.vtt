THAT, YUSEI.

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:00.239
IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:03.409

I SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:15.855
LOKI, LORD OF THE AESIR
THE ULTIMATE TRICKSTER.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:21.827
INCREDIBLE

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.828
UH.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.630
WHOA. SHOCK AND AWE.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.300
WE'VE GOT TWO NORDIC GODS ON
THE FIELD HERE, PEOPLE.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.838
HEH HEH. NOW THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.940
Loki, Lord of the Aesir is

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.711
a spellcaster type monster
with 3300 attack points

00:19:38.711 --> 00:19:41.013
and 3000 defense points.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.649
THOR IS TRULY GREAT, BUT
I WANTED TO FIGHT WITH MY

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.485
OWN GOD LOKI IS
THE MASTER OF MISCHIEF,

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:48.354
THE KING OF TRICKERY.

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:51.090
NOW I'VE GOT TWO NORDIC GODS.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.025
IT'S OVER FOR YOU, CROW.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:56.595

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:03.703
[♪...]

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.774
HATE TO BREAK
IT TO YA', BUT THIS

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:12.778
IS FAR FROM OVER. I REVEAL
MY TRAP. IT'S BLACK SONIC.

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:15.715
NOW IF BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
IS OUT ON MY FIELD
AND YOU ATTACK,

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.883
I CAN ACTIVATE THIS
CARD'S POWER.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.886
AND REMOVE ALL YOUR MONSTERS
IN ATTACK MODE FROM PLAY.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.354
YOU WHAT?

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.790
IF THEY'RE REMOVED FROM
PLAY, THEY CAN'T RESURRECT

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.559
THIS WAS CROW'S PLAN ALL ALONG.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.160
BRODER PLAYED RIGHT INTO IT.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.595
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
THAT I THOUGHT

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.964
THAT YOU COULDN'T SUMMON
ANOTHER GOD TO THE FIELD.

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:36.469
BUT I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD
SO I COULD TAKE 'EM BOTH OUT.

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:39.972
NO. WHAT WILL I DO?

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.842
OH, WAIT A SEC, WHAT AM
I SAYING, I'M GOOD TO GO.

00:20:42.842 --> 00:20:45.311
'CAUSE I AM STILL FIVE
STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:46.579
WHAT?

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.215
CHECK OUT LOKI'S SPECIAL
ABILITY. WHEN LOKI ATTACKS,

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:52.017
HE CAN ALSO NEGATE AND
DESTROY ONE CARD IN YOUR

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.586
SPELL AND TRAP ZONE.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.221
SO MUCH FOR BLACK SONIC.

[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:20:56.856 --> 00:20:58.224
OH, MAN.

00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.492
I'M SORRY, CROW.

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:02.294
BUT I'M GONNA BURY YOUR
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON.

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.363
GO VANITY BLAST.

00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.323
I DON'T THINK CROW
SAW THAT COMING.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:33.626
SUDDENLY, HIS FIELD IS EMPTY
AND HE'S GOT TWO

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.061
NORDIC GODS STARING HIM DOWN.

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.329
NO WAY.

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.931
IS THERE ANYTHING
HE CAN DO?

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.466
I DUNNO.

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.601
CROW'S GOT 50
LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:46.405
NO CARDS. NONE. AND NOTHING
STANDING BETWEEN HIM AND

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.440
THE POWER OF THE GODS.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.510
SOMEONE TELL CROW HE'S DONE FOR.
