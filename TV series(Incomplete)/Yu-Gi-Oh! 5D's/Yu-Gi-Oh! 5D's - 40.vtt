00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:13.526
WHA... WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:09:13.526 --> 00:09:16.763
AAH! MY ARM.

00:09:16.763 --> 00:09:20.967
WHAT HAPPENED, DADDY?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:22.736
MAKE IT GO AWAY,
PLEASE, DADDY.

00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:25.705
I'M SCARED.
DO SOMETHING. HELP ME.

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:27.440
DON'T COME
ANY CLOSER.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.409
HOW DID YOU DO THAT
TO ME, AKIZA?

00:09:29.409 --> 00:09:32.545
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU MONSTER.

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:35.015
DON'T CALL
HER THAT.

00:09:35.015 --> 00:09:37.183
I'M A... MONSTER?

00:09:37.217 --> 00:09:39.419
[SOBBING]

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.921
I DIDN'T
MEAN THAT.

00:09:41.921 --> 00:09:43.757
YOU JUST SCARED ME.

00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:46.826
[SOBBING]

00:09:49.496 --> 00:09:53.800
THAT DAY,
THE BLACK ROSE
WAS BORN.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.169
[SOBBING]

00:10:11.616 --> 00:10:14.853
IT'S ALL MY FAULT
THAT AKIZA, MY
PRECIOUS DAUGHTER,

00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:17.222
BECAME
THE DUELIST KNOWN
AS THE BLACK ROSE.

00:10:17.222 --> 00:10:20.325
HER PSYCHIC POWERS
KEPT GROWING STRONGER.

00:10:20.325 --> 00:10:23.628
I COULDN'T EVEN LET HER
AROUND OTHER CHILDREN...

00:10:23.628 --> 00:10:26.064
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:30.201
AND INSTEAD OF HELPING,
I MADE THINGS WORSE.

00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:33.505
SHE PROBABLY JUST NEEDED
A FATHER'S LOVE
AND UNDERSTANDING,

00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:36.741
BUT I WAS AFRAID OF HER
AND PUSHED HER AWAY.

00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:39.244
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO,

00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:42.280
SO I SENT HER AS FAR
AWAY AS POSSIBLE

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.582
TO THE ONE PLACE
THAT WOULD TAKE HER...

00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:46.318
DUEL ACADEMY.

00:10:46.318 --> 00:10:48.954
I THOUGHT THEY'D TEACH HER
TO CONTROL HER POWERS,

00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:51.723
BUT THERE WAS NO
CONTROLLING AKIZA.

00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:52.724
[BEEPING]

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:56.761
MM...

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.730
[PANTING]

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.434
Hideo, voice-over:
DUEL ACADEMY ONLY
MADE HER FEEL MORE ISOLATED,

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:06.671
SO ONE NIGHT, SHE DECIDED
TO RUN HOME.

00:11:06.671 --> 00:11:08.173
IT'S NICE TO BE HOME
FOR DINNER.

00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:10.575
THIS MUST HAVE TAKEN
FOREVER TO PREPARE.

00:11:10.575 --> 00:11:12.277
WELL, I DID SPEND
ALL DAY DECIDING

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:14.579
WHICH TAKE-OUT PLACE
TO ORDER FROM.

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:17.983
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:11:17.983 --> 00:11:20.185
Woman: DOCTOR, LOOK
AT THESE READINGS.

00:11:20.185 --> 00:11:21.753
[MOANING]

00:11:21.753 --> 00:11:24.255
Hideo, voice-over:
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
SHE STOOD THERE WATCHING US,

00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:27.792
WATCHING US ENJOY OUR LIVES
WITHOUT HER.

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:30.762
AKIZA?

00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:33.031
Hideo, voice-over:
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE LOOK ON HER FACE.

00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:35.767
IT WAS THE NIGHT
I LOST MY DAUGHTER.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.569
THAT NIGHT SHE
WANTED HER FAMILY,

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:39.738
AND I DIDN'T
HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO GIVE HER ONE.

00:11:39.738 --> 00:11:41.673
THEN SHE GOT MAD.

00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:44.275
HAH!

00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:48.713
UH!
UH! AAH!

00:11:48.713 --> 00:11:52.183
COME BACK.
I'M SORRY. COME BACK.

00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:55.620
Hideo, voice-over:
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
I SAW AKIZA UNTIL TODAY.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.389
I KNOW SHE JOINED
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT,

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:58.990
AND THAT EASED MY PAIN,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.259
BUT I ALWAYS WONDERED
IF SHE FELT VULNERABLE.

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:04.162
Akiza, voice-over:
I JUST NEED TO FEEL SAFE AGAIN.

00:12:04.162 --> 00:12:05.764
SAYER, HELP ME.

00:12:05.797 --> 00:12:08.767
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO FREED ME OF MY FEARS.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.268
YOU WANT TO TEST ME?

00:12:10.268 --> 00:12:12.637
CHECK OUT A DIRECT ATTACK
FROM MY VIOLET WITCH.

00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:13.638
HAH!

00:12:13.638 --> 00:12:15.774
UH!

00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:17.976
NOT BAD, BUT IF YOU
REALLY WANT TO LEARN

00:12:17.976 --> 00:12:19.944
HOW TO MASTER
YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS,

00:12:19.944 --> 00:12:21.546
THEN STOP RUNNING
FROM THE MEMORIES

00:12:21.546 --> 00:12:22.714
HIDDEN IN YOUR PAST.

00:12:22.714 --> 00:12:24.416
YOUR FAMILY FEARED YOU.

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:26.251
THEY WERE SCARED, AND THEY
TRIED TO SEND YOU AWAY

00:12:26.251 --> 00:12:28.086
AS FAR AS POSSIBLE,
DIDN'T THEY?

00:12:28.086 --> 00:12:30.155
BUT NOW YOU'RE HERE
IN YOUR NEW HOME.

00:12:30.155 --> 00:12:32.657
FORGET THE PAIN YOUR FAMILY
AND FRIENDS CAUSED YOU.

00:12:32.657 --> 00:12:35.060
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND
AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.562
BUT I'M AFRAID.

00:12:37.562 --> 00:12:39.431
I'M GLAD YOU'RE AFRAID.

00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:42.167
IT MEANS YOU KNOW YOU'RE
MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION.

00:12:42.167 --> 00:12:45.637
I'LL ALWAYS BE HERE
FOR YOU, I PROMISE.

00:12:45.637 --> 00:12:48.406
ARCADIA AND I CAN BE
YOUR NEW FAMILY.

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:50.375
YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER.
YOU'RE YOU.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.011
I DON'T KNOW.
AND YOU NEVER WILL...

00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:54.679
UNLESS YOU OPEN UP
TO YOUR NEW FAMILY

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:56.781
AND ACCEPT
WHO YOU ARE,

00:12:56.781 --> 00:12:58.883
BUT BE MINDFUL
OF OUTSIDERS,

00:12:58.883 --> 00:13:00.351
FOR THEY WILL
TRY TO FILL YOU

00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:02.687
WITH FALSE HOPE
AND EMPTY PROMISES.

00:13:02.687 --> 00:13:04.189
Akiza, voice-over:
SAYER WAS RIGHT.

00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:06.424
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO YUSEI.

00:13:06.424 --> 00:13:07.892
EMBRACE YOUR DRAGON.

00:13:07.892 --> 00:13:11.196
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
JUST LIKE YOU ARE
UNDER THAT MASK.

00:13:11.196 --> 00:13:12.964
I'M NOT BEAUTIFUL.

00:13:12.964 --> 00:13:15.200
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME,
AND IT'S THIS MARK

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.902
THAT'S CAUSED
ALL THE SUFFERING
I'VE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH.

00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:21.473
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT IF YOU STAY MAD,
YOU'LL ALWAYS SUFFER.

00:13:21.473 --> 00:13:25.076
SO JUST ACCEPT IT?
EMBRACE IT?

00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:28.079
FORGET THE PAST?

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.781
HATE IS ALL I KNOW.

00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:31.549
I NEVER WANTED
TO STOP YOU.

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:33.384
I WANTED TO SAVE YOU.

00:13:36.654 --> 00:13:38.456
I NEED YOU.

I CAN'T HEAL
HER BROKEN HEART,
BUT YOU CAN.

00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:43.895
JACK SAID THAT YOU
CARED ABOUT HER.

00:13:43.895 --> 00:13:47.098
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE STRENGTH TO HELP HER.

00:13:47.098 --> 00:13:48.533
BUT YOU MUST.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:51.236
JACK THINKS
THAT YOU JUST NEED
TO DUEL HER AGAIN.

00:13:51.236 --> 00:13:55.039
HE SAID YOUR VOICE HAS
THE POWER TO WAKE AKIZA
FROM HER COMA.

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:57.442
YOUR DECK MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HEAL HER HEART.

00:13:57.442 --> 00:14:00.945
I WOULD, BUT I'M
IN NO SHAPE TO DUEL
ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

00:14:00.945 --> 00:14:03.314
BUT YOU'RE HER
LAST HOPE. PLEASE.

FOR GOODNESS SAKE,

00:14:06.284 --> 00:14:09.954
YOU CAN'T TURN YOUR BACK ON
THIS POOR GIRL, OR SO HELP ME...

00:14:09.954 --> 00:14:13.224
UNLESS YOU'RE AFRAID
TO DUEL AGAIN.

00:14:13.224 --> 00:14:14.859
HUH?

00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:21.966
AH, SO IT'S TRUE.

00:14:21.966 --> 00:14:24.836
YOU'RE STILL THINKING ABOUT
THAT DUEL WITH KALIN, RIGHT?

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:26.504
WELL, YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

00:14:26.504 --> 00:14:30.041
WOUND IS HEALED.

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:32.177
I... WELL, SEE...

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:34.579
SHAME ON YOU, YUSEI.

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:36.748
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HELP THAT YOUNG GIRL,

00:14:36.748 --> 00:14:38.249
THEN WHY'D
I PATCH YOU UP?

00:14:38.249 --> 00:14:40.752
IF I'VE ONLY TAUGHT YOU
ONE THING, YUSEI,

00:14:40.752 --> 00:14:42.754
IT'S TO HELP
YOUR FRIENDS.

00:14:42.754 --> 00:14:43.888
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU,

00:14:43.888 --> 00:14:46.324
AND IF EVERYTHING YOU SAID
ABOUT THESE DARK SIGNERS,

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:48.359
PURPLE LIGHTS,
AND THE END OF THE WORLD

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:50.762

THEN YOU'LL NEED THEIR HELP,

00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.932
AND YOU'RE SURE NOT GONNA GET IT
BY SITTING IN MY DINING ROOM.

00:14:53.932 --> 00:14:56.534
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW SCARED YOU MUST BE,

00:14:56.534 --> 00:14:59.704
BUT YOU HAVE TO FACE
THAT FEAR.

00:14:59.704 --> 00:15:01.239
HMM.

00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:03.641
THEN YOU'LL HELP?

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.712
AND ONCE THIS IS ALL OVER,
MAYBE YOU'LL TAKE HER ON A DATE.

00:15:07.712 --> 00:15:10.181
HUH? A WHAT?
I'M JUST SAYING...

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:12.183
IF YOU TWO HAD SOME
SORT OF CONNECTION...

00:15:12.183 --> 00:15:14.285

THE WORLD, NOT DATE.

00:15:14.285 --> 00:15:16.554

GOT A GIRLFRIEND...

I KNEW YOU'D SHOW UP.

00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:33.805

00:15:47.118 --> 00:15:48.786

HUH?

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.740
WHAT'RE THEY
DOING HERE?

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.676
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,
I'VE GOT TO NEW FAMILY.

00:16:11.676 --> 00:16:13.478
SAYER IS ALL I NEED NOW.

00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:14.779
OH!

00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:17.181
AAH!

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.289
I REMEMBER.

00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:27.959
HE FELL, DIDN'T HE,
INTO THAT GLOW,

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:30.928
BUT HE WAS ALL...
ALL I HAD LEFT.

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:33.531
HE WAS MORE A FATHER
TO ME THAN YOU EVER WERE.

00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:35.066
THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT.

00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:37.769
IT WAS THE DARK SIGNERS.
STAY OUT OF THIS, YUSEI.

00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:40.938
THAT STRANGER OVER THERE
RUINED MY LIFE.

00:16:40.938 --> 00:16:42.840
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO NOW?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.476
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME BUT A HOME IN RUIN

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:48.212
AND ANOTHER FATHER
THAT'S MISSING.

00:16:48.212 --> 00:16:51.149
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ERASE
THE PAST, DON'T BOTHER.

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:54.319
I HAVE ALREADY
FORGOT ABOUT THEM.

00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:58.389
AND NOW I THINK
I'LL ERASE YOU FROM
MY MEMORIES, AS WELL.

00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:59.324
DON'T DO THIS.

00:16:59.324 --> 00:17:01.526
I KNOW THIS IS
HARD TO TAKE IN,

00:17:01.526 --> 00:17:04.329
BUT IF YOU NEED TO
DUEL TO FIND OUT WHO
YOUR FRIENDS ARE,

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:05.963
THEN I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:08.199
FRIENDS? YOU MEAN
LIKE YOU SIGNERS?

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.834
FROM THE MOMENT
I MET YOU,

00:17:09.834 --> 00:17:11.636
I'VE HAD MY LIFE
COMPLETELY TORN APART,

00:17:11.636 --> 00:17:13.905
THANKS TO THAT
THING ON MY ARM,

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:17.875
AND THAT'S NO ONE'S
FAULT BUT YOUR OWN.

00:17:32.628 --> 00:17:34.864
AKIZA, PLEASE
LET US HELP YOU.

00:17:34.864 --> 00:17:37.367
YOU ALL WANT TO
DESTROY MY LIFE.

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:39.435
WELL, I WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:41.871
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:41.871 --> 00:17:43.873
AKIZA!

00:17:43.873 --> 00:17:46.776
IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY

00:17:46.776 --> 00:17:49.178
AND PROVE THAT WE'RE
ALL TRYING TO HELP YOU.

00:17:49.178 --> 00:17:50.546
DUEL, HUH?

00:17:50.546 --> 00:17:52.281
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
NEVER WERE GONNA ASK ME.

00:17:52.281 --> 00:17:55.818
NOW I'LL GET RID OF YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:17:55.818 --> 00:17:58.021
AKIZA, THE ONLY TIME
I EVER GOT THROUGH

00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:00.723
TO THE REAL YOU
WAS DURING OUR DUEL,

00:18:00.723 --> 00:18:02.158
SO THIS IS FOR YOU.

00:18:02.158 --> 00:18:05.328
LET'S DUEL.
LET'S DUEL,
AND I'LL BE GOING FIRST.

00:18:05.328 --> 00:18:09.432
I SUMMON MY MONSTER
EVIL THORN,

00:18:09.465 --> 00:18:12.135
AND I THINK I'LL ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:18:12.135 --> 00:18:14.737
IF I SACRIFICE IT
RIGHT AWAY,

00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:17.540
YOU END UP TAKING
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.075
I CAN'T ATTACK
ON MY FIRST TURN,

00:18:19.075 --> 00:18:21.044
SO IT SEEMS LIKE
A GOOD TRADE-OFF.

00:18:21.044 --> 00:18:23.746
THIS MIGHT STICK
A LITTLE.

00:18:25.048 --> 00:18:28.684
HAAH! UH...

00:18:28.684 --> 00:18:30.620
YUSEI!
JACK, LOOK.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.588
IT'S THE FIRST ROUND,
AND YUSEI HAS ALREADY

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:35.525
BEEN KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET
BY AKIZA'S PSYCHIC POWERS.

00:18:35.525 --> 00:18:36.926
AND I THINK
THERE'S MORE COMING.

00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:38.561
THE EX-CHAMP
AND YOUR FRIENDS

00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:40.496
HAVE A REASON
TO BE WORRIED, YUSEI.

00:18:40.496 --> 00:18:42.498
AS SOON AS I SACRIFICE
ONE EVIL THORN,

00:18:42.498 --> 00:18:44.233
TWO TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:18:44.233 --> 00:18:46.936
BUT HER THORNS DON'T HAVE
THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES.

00:18:46.936 --> 00:18:48.004
THANK GOODNESS.

00:18:48.004 --> 00:18:49.305
YEAH, BUT IF
HE'S TRYING

00:18:49.305 --> 00:18:50.706
TO HELP
AKIZA BY
WINNING,

00:18:50.706 --> 00:18:51.974
HE'S GOT TO
DO BETTER.

00:18:51.974 --> 00:18:54.444
AND NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
A SPELL CARD.

00:18:54.444 --> 00:18:58.281
IT'S CALLED
CLOSED PLANT GATE.

00:18:58.281 --> 00:19:01.918
I CAN USE IT
WHENEVER THERE'S TWO
PLANT MONSTERS ON MY FIELD.

00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:04.153
THE SPELL GIVES THEM THE POWER
TO CREATE A LIVING WALL

00:19:04.153 --> 00:19:06.055
THAT NOTHING
CAN PENETRATE.

00:19:06.055 --> 00:19:08.591
THAT MEANS NO ATTACKS
FOR YOU NEXT ROUND.

00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:11.594
YOUR TURN. HAVE FUN.
I'M NOT.

00:19:11.594 --> 00:19:13.196
I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU,

00:19:13.196 --> 00:19:16.332
AND THIS GUY MIGHT
JUST DO THE TRICK.

00:19:18.267 --> 00:19:19.569
OH...
OH...

00:19:19.569 --> 00:19:22.138
SHIELD WARRIOR IS GREAT,
BUT HE CAN'T EVEN ATTACK.

00:19:22.138 --> 00:19:24.240
YUSEI CAN'T JUST
PLAY DEFENSE ALL GAME.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.043
I'LL THROW DOWN A COUPLE
FACEDOWNS. YOUR TURN.

00:19:27.043 --> 00:19:28.911
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:30.947
WELL, IT WON'T HELP
AGAINST THIS.

00:19:30.947 --> 00:19:34.417
I SUMMON TWILIGHT
ROSE KNIGHT.

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:38.988
Computer: WHEN YOU SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMON TWILIGHT ROSE KNIGHT,

00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:41.491
YOU CAN ALSO BRING OUT
ONE LEVEL-4 OR BELOW

00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:43.826
PLANT TYPE MONSTER
FROM YOUR HAND.

00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:45.761
I GOT
A BAD FEELING.

00:19:45.761 --> 00:19:48.164
AND MY KNIGHT WILL
ONLY MAKE IT WORSE

00:19:48.164 --> 00:19:50.867
BECAUSE NOW I GET TO SUMMON
ANOTHER PLANT TYPE MONSTER

00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:53.603
FROM MY HAND AS LONG
AS IT'S LEVEL-4 OR BELOW,

00:19:53.603 --> 00:19:57.340
AND I CHOOSE DARK VERGER.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.942
BUT WITH THOSE
4 MONSTERS...

00:19:59.942 --> 00:20:02.178
YOU CATCH ON QUICK,
DON'T YOU, YUSEI?

00:20:02.178 --> 00:20:04.947
TWILIGHT ROSE KNIGHT TUNES UP
ALL 4 OF MY MONSTERS

00:20:04.947 --> 00:20:06.983
TO YOU KNOW WHO.

00:20:06.983 --> 00:20:09.018
TWO EVIL THORNS
PLUS WHAT ELSE?

00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:10.987
BLACK VERGER...

00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:13.923
EQUALS BLACK
ROSE DRAGON.

00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:15.591
I KNOW YOU THINK
BY DUELING ME,

00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:17.760
YOU'LL FIND THE GOOD
AKIZA YOU KNEW,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.197
BUT SHE LEFT THE MOMENT
SAYER AND ARCADIA WERE LOST.

00:20:21.197 --> 00:20:23.199
I'M THE BLACK ROSE,

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:27.370
AND I SYNCHRO SUMMON
BLACK ROSE DRAGON.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.912
THIS DUEL ISN'T
JUST ABOUT WINNING
OR LOSING ANYMORE.

00:20:35.912 --> 00:20:38.314
IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO
WHO ACTUALLY SURVIVES.

00:20:38.314 --> 00:20:42.351
AND NOW, I ACTIVATE
THE EQUIP SPELL
THORN OF MALICE.

00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:46.556
THIS GIVES MY DRAGON
A LITTLE POWER BOOST.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.195
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

00:20:52.195 --> 00:20:53.863
PLEASE, DON'T.

00:20:53.863 --> 00:20:56.265
DON'T TRY
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

00:20:56.265 --> 00:20:58.401
YOU TREATED ME LIKE
A MONSTER

00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:00.603
SO NOW I'LL BEHAVE
LIKE ONE.

00:21:00.603 --> 00:21:03.506
THAT'S WHO I AM.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:07.043
IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR YOU
TO TRY AND HELP ME, YUSEI.

00:21:07.043 --> 00:21:09.679
I THOUGHT YOU REALLY
BELIEVED IN ME,

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:11.614
BUT IT WAS
ALL ABOUT MY MARK.

00:21:11.614 --> 00:21:16.052
I'LL NEVER DUEL FOR YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT, GOT THAT?
