00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.288
GO AND DO WHAT?

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:23.689
HUH?

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.792
THE DUEL WILL BE OVER
BY THE TIME
YOU FIND THE GHOST.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.495
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:30.696
WILL YOU, YUSEI?

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:32.098
HUH!

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:35.334
YOU'RE NOT READY
TO FACE THE GHOST AGAIN.

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:44.376
YOU MUST FIRST FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:46.679
LOOKING FOR?

00:20:47.346 --> 00:20:50.950
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION!

00:20:51.617 --> 00:20:54.620
Crow: THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION?
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

00:20:55.287 --> 00:20:56.922
AND ANOTHER THING,
WHO EXACTLY ARE YOU?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.991
HOW ABOUT A NAME
OR SOMETHING, BUDDY?

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:00.960
YOU CAN CALL ME VIZOR.

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.462
SO, VIZOR, HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST YOU?

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.531
YOU CAN'T.
AND WHERE I COME FROM,

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:08.234
TRUST IS SOMETHING
A PERSON HAS TO EARN.

00:21:08.901 --> 00:21:09.401
GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO
DUEL ME

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:12.404
AND FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:16.475
LEAD THE WAY, VIZOR.
