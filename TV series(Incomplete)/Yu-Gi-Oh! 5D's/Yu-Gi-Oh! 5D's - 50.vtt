00:09:02.202 --> 00:09:06.440
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR LION
FRIEND WAS ABLE TO LIFT
THE CURSE AFTER ALL.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.543
BACK TO MY OLD SELF.
EMPHASIS ON OLD!

00:09:09.543 --> 00:09:11.512
IS...
THAT REALLY YOU?!

00:09:11.512 --> 00:09:14.481
I TOLD YOU I WAS AN OLD MAN!

00:09:14.481 --> 00:09:16.049
YEAH, BUT...

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:17.684
"GRANDPA" OLD?!

00:09:17.684 --> 00:09:19.153
YOU'RE...

00:09:19.153 --> 00:09:21.221
YOU'RE OLDER THAN
A WRINKLE ON DIRT.

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:22.322
HA HA!

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.524
THAT MEANS
IT WORKED!

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:24.691
REGULUS BROKE THE CURSE!

00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:25.692
MMM....

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:27.094
Regulus: LUNA!

00:09:28.962 --> 00:09:30.464
YOU'RE OK!

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:32.466
THANK YOU, REGULUS,
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:35.836
THE RULE OF ZEMAN
THE APE KING IS NO MORE.

00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:39.072
THAT MEANS...
MY ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON IS FREE!

00:09:39.072 --> 00:09:42.676
I'M AFRAID PART OF THE CURSE
STILL LIVES LUNA.

00:09:42.709 --> 00:09:44.278
WHAT?!

00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:46.346
YOUR FRIEND AND
THE OTHER FREE WIZARDS

00:09:46.346 --> 00:09:47.614
HAVE REGAINED
THEIR TRUE AGE,

00:09:47.614 --> 00:09:50.217
BUT THE CAPTURED
DUEL SPIRITS REMAIN TRAPPED.

00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:52.986
ZEMAN TRANSFERRED THE POWER
OF THE CURSE TO DEVACK.

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:56.423
UNTIL HE IS DEFEATED,
THE DUEL SPIRITS
ARE HIS PRISONERS.

00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:58.525
IT'S MY TURN LEO.

00:09:58.525 --> 00:10:00.527
I DRAW!

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:02.830
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THANKS
ARE IN ORDER

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.699
FOR ENABLING ME TO SUMMON
2 MONSTERS TO THE FIELD
LAST ROUND.

00:10:05.732 --> 00:10:07.334
WHY'S THAT?!

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:12.039
YOU SEE, I NEED TWO
SACRIFICES TO SUMMON OUT
MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.807
HA HA!

00:10:13.807 --> 00:10:14.808
NOT GOOD!

00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:17.644
NOT GOOD IS RIGHT, YUSEI.

00:10:17.644 --> 00:10:21.682
OH, NO, IT'S GONNA TAKE ME
AND MY FRIENDS AWAY!

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:22.783
AH!

00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:25.219
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

00:10:25.219 --> 00:10:28.255
THIS IMMORTAL REQUIRES
A DIFFERENT KIND OF
POWER SOURCE.

00:10:28.255 --> 00:10:30.958
ONE THAT EXISTS
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.696
BY THE POWER OF THE DARK
SIGNERS, I SUMMON EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL CUSILLU!

00:10:35.729 --> 00:10:36.897
WE HAVE TA SAVE LEO!

00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:38.565
HOW?!

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:41.101
AAH!

00:10:42.903 --> 00:10:45.806
THAT'S DEVACK'S MARK
OF THE MONKEY!

00:10:50.143 --> 00:10:52.846
Redulus: IT'S ABSORBING
THE DUEL SPIRITS!

00:10:52.846 --> 00:10:54.514
NO!

00:10:54.514 --> 00:10:56.383
SOON, THEY'LL ALL
BE GONE, LUNA!

00:10:56.383 --> 00:10:59.152
Torunka: WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY
TO STOP THIS!

00:10:59.152 --> 00:11:02.289
THAT'S IF THESE EARTHBOUND
IMMORTALS EVEN CAN BE STOPPED!

00:11:20.396 --> 00:11:22.798
Devack: WATCH AS ALL
YOUR PATHETIC DUEL SPIRITS

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.668
BECOME THE FUEL
FOR YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:30.139
WITH THEIR ENERGIES,
I CAN SUMMON THE MOST
POWERFUL MONSTER EVER!

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:47.156
AAH!

00:11:50.826 --> 00:11:52.762
Duel Runner Computer:
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL CUSILLU

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:54.797
HAS 2800 ATTACK POINTS,

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:58.567
2400 DEFENSE POINTS, AND CAN
ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT DIRECTLY.

00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:00.102
OH, COME ON!

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:01.637
WHAT'S WITH THIS GUY
AND THE MONKEYS?!

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:02.938
YA GOT ME.
ALL I KNOW IS

00:12:02.938 --> 00:12:05.341
LEO'S GOTTA FIGURE
OUT OUT A WAY TO
TAME THAT BEAST.

00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:08.677
BEHOLD MY EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL CUSILLU!

00:12:08.677 --> 00:12:11.647
THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR DECK
THAT CAN STOP ITS POWER!

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:15.418
IT'S IMMUNE TO ANY
ATTACKS, TRAPS AND SPELLS
YOU MIGHT THROW ITS WAY!

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:17.053
JUST MY LUCK!

00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:19.255
THERE'S ALSO THE
NOT-SO-LITTLE MATTER

00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:20.890
OF HIS GRAVEYARD BONUS!

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.959
THANKS TO MY
CLOSED FOREST FIELD SPELL,

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:28.497
IT RECEIVES AN EXTRA HUNDRED
ATTACK POINTS FOR EVERY
MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:33.169
PERHAPS THE NEXT TIME YOU'LL
THINK TWICE ABOUT TAKING YOUR
SISTER'S PLACE IN A SHADOW DUEL!

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.439
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,
ATTAAAAAACK!!!

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:38.841
HE DOESN'T
HAVE A MONSTER
TO STOP THAT THING!

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:39.875
LEO!

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:41.343
WHO NEEDS A MONSTER...

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:42.611
WHEN YOU'VE GOT THIS!

00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:44.947
I TRIGGER MY TRAP CARD
POWER CONVERTER!

00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:46.715
SOON AS I SEND IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:48.084
ALL OF MY DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:12:48.084 --> 00:12:50.086
ARE CONVERTED OVER
TO LIFE POINTS!

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:53.289
THE MOVE MIGHT MAKE HIM
A LITTLE WEEK UNTIL
NEXT ROUND,

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:56.292
BUT AT LEAST THERE
WILL BE A NEXT ROUND!

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:57.827
[PANTING]

00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:01.564
AAH!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.537
IF YOU'RE OUT THERE
LUNA, I COULD USE
SOME SISTERLY ADVICE.

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:11.107
IF NOT, I'M DONE FOR!

00:13:11.107 --> 00:13:12.575
LEO?

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:13.876
HE NEEDS MY HELP!

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.177
YOU SURE?!

00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:16.612
HUH?
HUH?

00:13:16.612 --> 00:13:18.881
YOU'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING, TORUNKA!

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.983
OR WE'LL ALL BE SUCKED
INTO THAT THING!

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:22.785
UNLESS WE CAN FIND A WAY
TO STOP DEVACK,

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:24.987
HE'LL TAKE EACH'N'EVERY
SPIRIT FROM OUR WORLD!

00:13:24.987 --> 00:13:26.355
WELL, THEN,
LET'S STOP HIM!

00:13:26.355 --> 00:13:27.423
BUT HOW?

00:13:27.423 --> 00:13:28.791
LIKE THIS!

00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:31.660
I HAVE JUST ENOUGH STRENGTH TO
SEND YOU BACK TO YOUR OWN WORLD!

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.064
NOW LISTEN, YOU MUST DEFEAT
THAT DEVACK!

00:13:35.064 --> 00:13:37.466
HE'S RIGHT,
MY LITTLE WARRIOR.

00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:39.768
SHOULD YOU FAIL,
ALL IS LOST.

00:13:39.768 --> 00:13:45.641
I GOTCHA...
NO PRESSURE!

00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:46.642
AH!

00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:48.511
GOOD LUCK, DEAR CHILD...

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.784
LOOK!

00:13:55.818 --> 00:13:58.587
HUH? LUNA?!

00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:03.559
OH, LEO!

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.561
PLEASE TELL ME THAT
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:07.763
UH. LUNA...

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.365
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:10.499
OF COURSE IT IS...

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.735
BUT NOW ITS TIME
FOR ME TO HELP YOU.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:15.137
I'M GOING TO TAKE
OVER YOUR DUEL, OK?

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:18.107
I GUESS I REALLY
LET YOU DOWN, HUH, SIS?

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.476
I COULDN'T EVEN WIN ONE
LILTTLE MATCH.

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:21.677
JUST LOOK AT ME...

00:14:21.677 --> 00:14:24.346
I'M THE SIDEKICK
WHO CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:26.348
EXCEPT BE MY HERO.
HUH?

00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:27.616
IT'S TRUE!

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.385
NOT... NOT
AS A DUELIST...

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:31.287
BUT AS MY BROTHER!

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.789
UH! NOT SO HARD!

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:35.758
YOU'RE SQUEEZING
THE TEARS OUT!

00:14:35.758 --> 00:14:37.760
[SOBBING]

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.662
Devack: HA HA HA!

00:14:39.662 --> 00:14:42.631
I'M GLAD YOU FINALLY
JOINED US, LUNA!

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.801
MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
HAS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY.

00:14:45.834 --> 00:14:47.203
LET'S DUEL, SIGNER!

00:14:47.203 --> 00:14:49.305
OH, WE'LL DUEL, DEVACK.

00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.040
AND WHEN I GET
THROUGH WITH YOU,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.777
YOU'RE GONNA WISH YOU
NEVER MESSED WITH ANY
OF MY SPIRIT FRIENDS.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.445
WILL I?

00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:58.781
DON'T WORRY, LEO.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:14:59.982
I PROMISE I'LL BE FINE.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:01.617
BE CAREFUL OUT THERE!

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:03.152
AS LONG AS HE HAS
THIS FIELD UP,

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:06.989
THAT EARTHBOUND MONKEY IS
PRACTICALLY INVINCIBLE!

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:08.524
I'M NOT WORRIED.

00:15:08.524 --> 00:15:11.093
I'M NOT
DOING THIS ALONE...
I'VE GOT YOUR DECK.

00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:13.929
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND
OF LIKE WE'RE DUELING
TOGETHER, ISN'T IT?

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:15.598
I GUESS SO.

00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:17.600
BUT IF WE'RE GOING
TO "DUEL TOGETHER,"
I'M STAYING BY YOUR SIDE.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.767
I HOPED YOU WOULD.

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:20.302
NOW LET'S WIN
THIS DUEL!

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:23.072
Yusei: LUNA!

00:15:23.072 --> 00:15:24.740
YUSEI, ITS GONNA BE OK.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.476
BE SAFE. HUH?

00:15:29.645 --> 00:15:31.080
OH!

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.017
AKIZA!
YOUR SIGN!

00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:38.754
SO LUNA'S BACK IN THE GAME.

00:15:38.754 --> 00:15:41.290
I REALLY HOPE SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S IN FOR!

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.725
LET'S ROLL CALL:

00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:47.096
LOOKS LIKE I GOT
POWER TOOL DRAGON
ON MY FIELD.

00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:51.333
AND YOU GOT A GIANT
TURKEY DAY BALLOON
ON YOURS! HRMPH!

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:54.303
I'M GLAD THAT
YOU CAN MAKE JOKES

00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:56.005
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

00:15:56.005 --> 00:15:59.275
IT'S NO FUN TAKING THE SPIRIT
OF SOMEONE WHO'S LOST HOPE.

00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:01.744
AND SPEAKING OF SOMEONE
WHO'S LOST HOPE,

00:16:01.744 --> 00:16:05.214
IT'S TIME I REINTRODUCE YOU
TO ONE OF YOUR OLDEST FRIENDS!

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:08.684
BUT FIRST I ACTIVATE
THE CURSED PRISON TRAP!

00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:12.154
NOW I CAN SUMMON A SYNCHRO
MONSTER OF MY CHOOSING,

00:16:12.154 --> 00:16:14.923
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE THE VERY SAME ONE

00:16:14.923 --> 00:16:17.793
YOU FAILED TO SAVE
BACK IN THE SPIRIT WORLD!

00:16:17.826 --> 00:16:20.329
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY PRISONER:

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:23.932
YOUR PRECIOUS
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON!!!

00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:49.395
SAY HELLO TO YOUR
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON!

00:16:49.395 --> 00:16:51.530
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER,
DEVACK?!

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.768
SHE'S NOT SOME STRAY DOG
YOU CAN LOCK UP IN A CAGE!

00:16:55.768 --> 00:16:58.871
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE IS:
A WILD ANIMAL.

00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:02.508
AND IF SHE DOESN'T LEARN
TO BEHAVE, I'LL TEAR
HER CARD IN HALF.

00:17:02.508 --> 00:17:04.143
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:05.511
MY TURN!

00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.714
THANKS TO POWER TOOL
DRAGON'S ABILITY,

00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:11.016
I CAN SEARCH MY DECK,
FIND AN EQUIP SPELL,

00:17:11.016 --> 00:17:12.518
AND SEND IT TO MY HAND!

00:17:12.518 --> 00:17:16.055
AND THIS ONE'S
GOING RIGHT INTO
IMMEDIATE ACTION:

00:17:17.857 --> 00:17:19.625
I FORGOT I HAD THAT!

00:17:19.625 --> 00:17:22.628
AND NOW, EVEN THOUGH
LUNA CAN'T STOP DEVACK'S
IMMORTAL FROM ATTACKING,

00:17:22.628 --> 00:17:24.263
AT LEAST SHE CAN
PROTECT YOUR DRAGON!

00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:25.898
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY,

00:17:25.898 --> 00:17:28.200
'CAUSE MY SIS ISN'T
GONNA LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.602
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, LUNA!

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:30.903
UH.

00:17:30.903 --> 00:17:34.406
I JUST HOPE THAT I DON'T
LET THE THREE OF US DOWN.

00:17:37.643 --> 00:17:40.613
I THINK I'LL END MY TURN
WITH TWO FACEDOWNS!

00:17:40.613 --> 00:17:42.615
A SHIELD
AND A COUPLE FACEDOWNS

00:17:42.615 --> 00:17:46.018
DON'T EXACTLY LEAD THE
DARK SIGNERS TO TREMBLE
IN FEAR.

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:47.786
IF THAT'S ALL
YOU CAN OFFER,

00:17:47.786 --> 00:17:51.857
I'M AFRAID THE CRIMSON DRAGON
MADE A GRAVE MISTAKE CHOOSING
YOU AS A SIGNER.

00:17:51.857 --> 00:17:54.526
PLEASE TELL ME THAT
THEY DIDN'T ENTRUST
THE FATE OF THE WORLD

00:17:54.526 --> 00:17:56.528
TO YOU AND A TOY DRAGON!

00:17:56.528 --> 00:17:58.230
YOU CAN'T WIN!

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.300
AND NOW EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL CUSILLU,

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:05.537
SEND THIS PATHETIC SIGNER
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:18:05.537 --> 00:18:08.040
THIS SIGNER'S
NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.009
I PLAY THE TRAP
LIMITER REMOVAL,

00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:12.745
WHICH DOUBLES THIS
"TOY'S" ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.746
HOW DARE YOU!

00:18:13.746 --> 00:18:16.115
[ROAR]

00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:18.050
AH!

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.486
AH!
AH!

00:18:24.957 --> 00:18:26.792
HUH?

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:27.927
THAT' A GIRL!

00:18:27.927 --> 00:18:29.261
UNWISE.

00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:31.997
I GUESS YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I GET ANGRY.

00:18:31.997 --> 00:18:34.934
IT DOESN'T END WELL
FOR ANYONE.

00:18:34.934 --> 00:18:37.670
AND THAT I'M AFRAID
IS TERRIBLE NEWS

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.174
FOR BOTH YOU AND
YOUR PRECIOUS ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON, DEAR LUNA.

00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:46.312
IF YOU HAVE ANY PARTING WORDS
FOR HER, YOU HAD BETTER SHARE
THEM NOW.

00:18:46.312 --> 00:18:49.214
IF NOT, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SHUT YOUR EYES...

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:51.083
THIS WON'T BE PRETTY!

00:18:51.083 --> 00:18:52.985
AH!

00:18:54.086 --> 00:18:56.655
OH! ARE YOU OK?

00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:58.257
I'M HERE LUNA!

00:18:58.257 --> 00:19:00.125
DON'T WORRY, LEO...

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:03.262
IT'S TIME TO TAKE BACK
MY ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON!

00:19:03.262 --> 00:19:06.031
BUT SHE'S IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:08.600
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR...

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.202
AS LONG AS SHE WAS STUCK
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:19:10.202 --> 00:19:12.071
IT WOULD'VE
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET HER BACK!

00:19:12.071 --> 00:19:16.208
BUT YOU SACRIFICED HER,
MAKING HER A FREE
AGENT...

00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:18.310
AND NOW BY PLAYING
RESPECT SYNCHRON,

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.645
SHE CAN JOIN MY TEAM!

00:19:19.645 --> 00:19:22.748
AND WITH A HEAVY HITTER
LIKE ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON

00:19:22.748 --> 00:19:24.116
ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD,

00:19:24.116 --> 00:19:25.584
YOU AND YOUR
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL

00:19:25.584 --> 00:19:27.886
DON'T STAND A CHANCE
OF WINNING THIS DUEL.

00:19:27.886 --> 00:19:30.155
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
GET HER BACK!

00:19:30.155 --> 00:19:32.391
THIS CANNOT BE!

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:57.216
Duel Runner Computer:
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON
IS A LEVEL SEVEN

00:19:57.216 --> 00:19:58.784
LIGHT ATTRIBUTE
SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:19:58.784 --> 00:20:02.921
WITH 2100 ATTACK POINTS
AND 3000 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:04.790
AH! YOU DID IT!

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.558
YOU GOT HER BACK!

00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:08.627
MMM.
OH!

00:20:08.627 --> 00:20:13.198
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON...
I KEPT MY PROMISE.

00:20:13.198 --> 00:20:15.634
THANK YOU, LUNA.

00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:17.436
I ASKED YOUR HELP
TO FREE ME

00:20:17.436 --> 00:20:20.305
AND YOU RISKED YOUR LIFE
AND YOUR SPIRIT

00:20:20.305 --> 00:20:23.709
TO SEE THAT
I WAS DELIVERED
FROM DEVACK'S PRISON.

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:29.148
NOW THAT I AM FREE,
WE CAN BEGIN TO HEAL
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:20:29.148 --> 00:20:31.383
LOOK AT THAT!
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL!

00:20:31.383 --> 00:20:32.584
YA THINK?

00:20:32.584 --> 00:20:34.686
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
LIKE "PRETTY..."
FOR A DRAGON.

00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:37.623
BUT PRETTY DOESNT WIN
DUELS, I'M AFRAID.

00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:41.493
Luna: NORMALLY LIMITER REMOVAL'S
EFFECT WOULD DESTROY MY DRAGON,

00:20:41.493 --> 00:20:43.729
BUT IF I SEND CENTRAL
SHIELD TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:20:43.729 --> 00:20:45.831
MY DRAGON DOESN'T HAVE
TO GO ANYWHERE.

00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:48.700
LOOKS LIKE THAT'S TWO
DRAGONS TO YOUR NONE!

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.202
VERY CLEVER.

00:20:50.202 --> 00:20:53.205
BUT EVEN ONE HUNDRED
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGONS

00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:55.474
WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH
TO HELP YOU NOW!

00:20:55.474 --> 00:20:56.842
NOW LET'S JUST SEE YOU

00:20:56.842 --> 00:20:59.211
TRY AND TAKE OUT
MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!

00:20:59.211 --> 00:21:00.579
FEEL UP TO IT, LEO?

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:01.747
YUP!

00:21:01.747 --> 00:21:02.915
LET'S DRAW THAT CARD SIS!

00:21:02.915 --> 00:21:05.050
HA!
HA!

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.086
BUT BEFORE
WE PLAY ANYTHING,

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:09.088
WE ACTIVATE
OUR DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:11.623
WHICH UPROOTS
YOUR CLOSED FOREST
FIELD SPELL.

00:21:11.623 --> 00:21:14.927
NO, YOU WOULDN'T!

00:21:18.197 --> 00:21:20.566
TAKE THAT!

00:21:20.566 --> 00:21:22.601
[GROANING]

00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:24.069
ARGH!

00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:26.438
ALL RIGHT, WITH THAT
FIELD SPELL GONE,

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:28.841
DEVACK'S MONKEY
HAS NO SPECIAL
ABILITIES!

00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:30.309
HE'S DONE FOR NOW!

00:21:30.342 --> 00:21:33.445
BUT I'M NOT,
CAUSE POWER TOOL
DRAGON LETS ME ADD

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:35.781
ANOTHER EQUIP SPELL
STRAIGHT TO MY HAND.

00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:40.552
AND NOW THAT I'VE GOT
TWO, I THINK I'LL POWER
UP BOTH MY DRAGONS.

00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:46.425
DEVACK!

00:21:46.425 --> 00:21:48.594
THIS IS THE END
OF THE LINE FOR
YOU AND YOUR MONKEY.

00:21:48.594 --> 00:21:51.797
I'M AFRAID THIS IS THE END
OF NOTHING, LITTLE GIRL.

00:21:51.797 --> 00:21:54.166
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT!

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.976
LUNA!

00:22:03.976 --> 00:22:05.677
[SCREAMING]

00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:11.550
AND WHAT DID I TELL YOU!

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.318
ALL YOU'VE DONE IS DESTROY
POWER TOOL DRAGON
AND HURT YOURSELF!

00:22:13.352 --> 00:22:16.288
TRY READING
THE CARD!

00:22:16.288 --> 00:22:18.223
YEAH! HE CAN'T
BE DESTROYED

00:22:18.223 --> 00:22:20.492
AS LONG AS HE'S EQUIPPED
WITH ROCKET PILDER,

00:22:20.492 --> 00:22:22.060
AND THAT'S NOT THE
CARD'S ONLY BONUS.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.896
YOUR MONSTER LOSES
ATTACK POINTS

00:22:23.896 --> 00:22:26.632
FOR EACH OF OUR
POWER TOOL DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:29.668
[GROAN]

00:22:29.668 --> 00:22:30.802
YOU CAN'T!

00:22:30.802 --> 00:22:32.971
I'M AFRAID WE CAN,
AND WE DID!

00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:35.741
AND NOW, MY FAIRY
DRAGON'S EQUIP SPELL
KICKS IN!

00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:38.477
ALL THE LIFE
THAT I JUST LOST WAS
WORTH EVERY POINT.

00:22:38.477 --> 00:22:39.811
THANKS TO PAIN
TO POWER,

00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:41.880
IT ALL GETS CONVERTED
TO ATTACK POINTS!

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.815
I THINK SHE'S STILL MAD
ABOUT BEING LOCKED UP!

00:22:43.815 --> 00:22:46.018
AND IT'S FINALLY TIME
FOR HER TO GET
SOME PAYBACK!

00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:47.786
WHADDYA THINK
'BOUT THAT?

00:22:47.786 --> 00:22:49.221
[ROAR]

00:22:49.221 --> 00:22:52.758
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON,
CHASE THOSE SHADOWS AWAY!

00:22:57.663 --> 00:23:00.265
ARGH!

00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:07.105
AH...
