TO EARTH'S SURVIVAL.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:30.336
WE MUST HURRY.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:33.540
THE NETHERWORLD
IS CALLING OUT FOR ME,
MY DEAR BROTHER.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.608
MY TIME HERE
IS FLEETING.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.610
WE MUST DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.013
TO BRING
THE GREAT SPIRITS
TOGETHER.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:43.116
I'VE PLAYED THE PART
THAT DESTINY WANTED ME
TO PLAY.

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:44.918
I HAVE FED
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.554
I'VE OPENED THE GATE
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:49.856
SOON, THE KING OF
THIS NETHERWORLD
WILL EMERGE,

00:09:49.856 --> 00:09:51.024
READY TO FIGHT.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:53.259
BUT YOUR SIGNERS,
YUSEI IN PARTICULAR,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.928
THEY'RE TRYING
TO CLOSE THE GATE.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.996
THEY'RE TRYING
TO STOP DESTINY.

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:58.865
BUT SO BE IT.
HUH?

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.800
IF THAT IS WHAT
ENDS UP HAPPENING,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.038
THEN I SUPPOSE WE MUST
RESPECT FATE'S WILL.

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:06.506
PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT,

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:07.707
BUT FOR THE PAST
FEW YEARS,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.475
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT EVERYTHING

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.643
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH,

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.278
AND I REALIZED
SOMETHING.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.847
THERE'S ANOTHER
POSSIBLE OUTCOME,

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:16.282
ONE WE'VE NEVER
CONSIDERED.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.419
THERE ARE HUNDREDS
OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES,
LITTLE BROTHER.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:20.887
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:22.589
THEN LET'S NOT WASTE
ANY MORE TIME,

00:10:22.589 --> 00:10:26.259
LET'S FINALLY LEARN
WHAT DESTINY
HAS IN STORE.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.873
LOOK AT THAT!
THE OLD REACTOR
SITE.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.307
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.810
WHEN THAT THING BLEW UP
WAY BACK WHEN.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.211
THINK EVERY
DISASTER MOVIE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN,

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.046
ROLL IT ALL INTO ONE,

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.315
THEN MULTIPLY THAT
TIMES 10.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.151
HERE'S HOPING THAT
NOTHIN' LIKE THAT
HAPPENS TODAY.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.186
MMM...

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.888
DON'T BE SCARED,
LUNA.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.123
THERE'S SOMETHING
POWERFUL AND TERRIFYING
DOWN THERE, LEO,

00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:58.491
I CAN FEEL IT!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.960
RIGHT, BUT...
I MEAN, UH...

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.263
I'LL BE WITH YOU,
SO THAT'S GOOD,
RIGHT?

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.864
MMM.

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:07.934
Leo: NO WAY!
IT'S TOO SCARY!

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:11.271
LET THE RECORD SHOW
LEO'S COURAGE LASTED
A WHOLE 2 SECONDS.

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:12.572
WELL, THIS IS IT.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:14.707
YEAH.
YOU WITH ME?

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.809
TILL THE WHEELS
FALL OFF, BUDDY!

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.848
HUH?

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.223
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:35.929
THE PUBLIC SECURITY BUREAU?

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:36.963
HUH?

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.078
HMM. TIME TO INVESTIGATE.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.357
Roman:
THERE YOU ARE!
HUH!

00:12:07.994 --> 00:12:09.295
IS THAT HIM?

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.430
STAY BACK!

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:11.497
[GASP]
[GASP]

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:12.598
HA HA HA!

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.467
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.336
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
YOU'D BE TOO TORN UP

00:12:16.336 --> 00:12:18.071
OVER WHAT YOU DID
TO YOUR FRIEND.

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.806
WHAT I DID!?

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.074
KALIN CHOSE
HIS OWN PATH.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.176
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIM!

00:12:23.176 --> 00:12:25.378
IF ANYONE'S TO BLAME
IT'S YOU, ROMAN!

00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.447
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF A MESSED-UP KID!

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:28.681
COME, NOW...

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:30.183
NO NEED TO GET WORKED UP.

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:31.884
I WASN'T BLAMING YOU.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.053
WE ALL DID WHAT DESTINY
WANTED US TO DO.

00:12:34.053 --> 00:12:36.823
WE'RE JUST PAWNS,
YUSEI, NO ONE'S TO BLAME.

00:12:36.823 --> 00:12:38.291
FROM THE BEGINNING,

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.859
YOU AND KALIN
WERE MEANT TO
BEFRIEND EACH OTHER

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:41.461
AND TO TURN AGAINST
ONE ANOTHER.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:43.262
YOU WERE MEANT TO
DESTROY YOUR FRIEND,

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.232
JUST AS I WAS MEANT
TO DESTROY YOUR FATHER!

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:47.433
MY FATHER?

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:49.168
[LAUGHING]

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.708
AAH!

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.443
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.514
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.384
IS ALL THIS LIGHT
COMING FROM THE REACTOR?

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.225
WHAT IS THIS?

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:14.293
CAN YOU FEEL IT,
YUSEI?

00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:15.361
20 YEARS AGO,

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.130
YOUR FATHER AND I
DISCOVERED A GATEWAY

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.299
LEADING TO SOMETHING
MORE INCREDIBLE THAN
EITHER OF US COULD IMAGINE.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.001
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT LIGHT

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.404
SLEEPS A MAGNIFICENT
POWER, YUSEI.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.572
ONCE THE NETHERWORLD GATE
FULLY OPENS,

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.608
THAT POWER WILL SPILL
INTO THIS WORLD

00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:30.476
AND CONSUME IT
COMPLETELY.

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:33.513
DO YOU EVEN CARE
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
YOU'VE TAKEN, ROMAN!?

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:34.947
THE PEOPLE THAT
YOU'VE HURT

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:37.950
SO THAT YOUR
EARTHBOUND IMMORTALS
CAN GAIN POWER?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.052
UP TILL NOW,

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:41.654
YOU'VE DONE WHATEVER
YOU WANTED TO DO.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.289
NOT ANYMORE.

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:46.592
I AM GONNA MAKE YOU PAY
FOR ALL THE DAMAGE
THAT YOU'VE DONE!

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.760
HMM.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.062
IN THE FACE OF
NEW POSSIBILITY,

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.931
IT'S INEVITABLE THAT
SOME CHANGE BE INCURRED.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:53.066
YOU DON'T GET IT!

00:13:53.066 --> 00:13:54.634
YOU DON'T GET IT!

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:57.103
THERE ARE INCREDIBLE
FORCES AT PLAY HERE, YUSEI.

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:58.838
WE HUMANS ARE JUST
THE MEANS TO AN END.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.540
WE'RE NOT IMPORTANT.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.642
WE'RE DISPOSABLE COGS
IN A MACHINE.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.977
OUR INDIVIDUAL LIVES
MEAN NOTHING!

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:06.446
LOOK AROUND YOU.

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:08.781
JUST LOOK AT THIS
BEAUTIFUL LIGHT!

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.917
THIS LIGHT IS ALIVE!

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:14.020
IT'S PART OF
A CHAIN REACTION THAT
TOOK PROFESSOR FUDO,

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.555
AND SOON,

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:19.092
AN EVEN GREATER DESTINY
WILL FIND ME AS WELL!

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.893
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS
FOR YOU.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.296
THE CRAZY STOPS
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW!

00:14:23.296 --> 00:14:24.797
I WILL SEND YOU
INTO THIS LIGHT

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:26.365
JUST AS I DID
YOUR FATHER!

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.801
COME. FIGHT ME!

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.505
Both: BE CAREFUL!

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:36.409
HA!

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.180
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:15:04.128 --> 00:15:06.230
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.300
THE FIRST MOVE IS MINE.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.170
YOU CAME HERE TO CHALLENGE
THE POWER OF THE SHADOWS.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.139
SO... LET'S FIND OUT
WHO DESTINY FAVORS.

00:15:15.139 --> 00:15:18.042
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.977
NO MONSTERS,
NO SPELLS, EITHER?

00:15:19.977 --> 00:15:21.712
IT'S MY TURN.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.048
[THINKING]
THAT FACEDOWN CARD
IS OBVIOUSLY A TRAP.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.349
HE'S EITHER
BAITING ME...

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:27.485
OR TRYING TO SCARE ME
OUT OF ATTACKING.

00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:29.821
TIME TO FIND OUT
WHICH ONE IT IS.

00:15:31.322 --> 00:15:32.590
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO CALL OUT

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.358
THIS LASER-TOTING
SHARP SHOOTER,

00:15:34.358 --> 00:15:37.161
I FIRST HAVE TO
DISCARD A MONSTER
FROM MY HAND.

00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:39.096
SO BY SENDING
LEVEL EATER
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:15:39.096 --> 00:15:41.599
I CAN SUMMON
QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON!

00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:49.207
Computer: QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON IS
A MACHINE TYPE TUNER MONSTER

00:15:49.207 --> 00:15:54.145
WITH 700 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1,400 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:15:54.145 --> 00:15:56.414
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
LEVEL EATER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:58.149
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:01.018
SO BY LOWERING
QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON'S
LEVEL BY 1,

00:16:01.018 --> 00:16:03.688
I CAN SUMMON
LEVEL EATER
TO THE FIELD!

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.861
NEXT, QUICKDRAW
SYNCHRON CAN TAKE AIM

00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:12.763
AND ABSORB THE POWERS
OF ONE TUNER MONSTER.

00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:15.700
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S TARGETING
THE ABILITIES OF...

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.002
JUNK SYNCHRON!

00:16:18.002 --> 00:16:19.337
SO NOW,
QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON

00:16:19.337 --> 00:16:23.074
CAN GIVE MY LEVEL EATER
A WELL-DESERVED TUNE-UP!

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.884
JUNK WARRIOR,
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:16:38.756 --> 00:16:41.492
NOW ATTACK ROMAN
DIRECTLY!

00:16:41.492 --> 00:16:43.628
GO, SCRAP FIST!

00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:47.031
[GRUNTING]

00:16:52.436 --> 00:16:53.504
NICE!

00:16:53.504 --> 00:16:54.538
HE DID IT!

00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:56.207
HE SCORED THE FIRST
MAJOR ATTACK!

00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:57.375
AND BECAUSE OF
THAT ATTACK,

00:16:57.408 --> 00:16:59.810
I CAN NOW ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD!

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.313
WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING!

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:03.848
SINCE I WAS HIT
WITH DAMAGE

00:17:03.848 --> 00:17:06.317
BY SPEED WARRIOR'S
DIRECT ATTACK,

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.120
I CAN USE THE POWER OF
MY WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.455
TO SUMMON
TWO DARK SPIDERS
TO MY FIELD

00:17:11.455 --> 00:17:13.457
FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.

00:17:13.457 --> 00:17:16.761
THAT WAS QUITE THE
BARGAIN-BASEMENT
MANEUVER, ROMAN.

00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:18.162
HA! THOSE
LITTLE SPIDERS

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.830
DON'T HAVE
ANY ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.266
THIS BAD GUY
HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:17:22.266 --> 00:17:23.734
THAT RIGHT THERE?

00:17:23.734 --> 00:17:26.137
THAT'S ONE OF YOUR WEAKEST
POINTS, LEO, YOU GET COCKY.

00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:27.939
ROMAN IS CLEARLY
PLANNING AHEAD

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:30.207
AND LOOKING TO EXECUTE
A MAJOR MANEUVER.

00:17:30.207 --> 00:17:32.043
HUH? OHH.

00:17:32.043 --> 00:17:33.110
LUNA'S RIGHT, LEO,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.378
THESE DARK SIGNERS
HAVE A WAY

00:17:34.378 --> 00:17:35.646
OF TURNING
THE DUEL AROUND,

00:17:35.646 --> 00:17:37.715
NO MATTER HOW
IT'S GOING.

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:39.283
HE BROUGHT THOSE
MONSTERS TO THE FIELD

00:17:39.283 --> 00:17:40.351
SO THAT HE CAN
RELEASE 'EM,

00:17:40.384 --> 00:17:41.752
WHICH MIGHT MEAN...

00:17:41.752 --> 00:17:42.954
I CAN FEEL IT!

00:17:42.954 --> 00:17:44.355
WHATEVER HAPPENS
NEXT, YOU TWO,

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:45.656
DON'T LEAVE MY SIDE.

00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:46.824
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:17:46.824 --> 00:17:47.892
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
FREAK ME OUT

00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:49.193
WHEN YOU TALK
LIKE THAT.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:50.561
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:51.696
FROM MY HAND,

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.698
I ACTIVATE
THE SPIDER WEB FIELD SPELL!

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.132
[THINKING]
HERE WE GO.

00:18:05.076 --> 00:18:06.077
OHH!
OHH!

00:18:06.077 --> 00:18:07.178
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:12.883
YOU'RE TRAPPED,

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.619
TRAPPED LIKE A FLY
CAUGHT IN THE SPIDER'S WEB,

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:20.091
AND NOW I'M RELEASING
BOTH OF MY DARK SPIDERS!

00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:22.660
LOOKS LIKE FATE
IS ON MY SIDE, YUSEI.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.029
THIS IS WHERE
YOUR STORY ENDS.

00:18:39.656 --> 00:18:41.758
Roman: THIS IS THE END,
YUSEI!

00:18:41.758 --> 00:18:45.228
THE POWERS OF DARKNESS
ARE READY TO RISE!

00:18:45.228 --> 00:18:46.697
HERE IT COMES!

00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:48.198
OHH!
OHH!

00:18:48.198 --> 00:18:49.900
HA HA HA!

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.737
I NOW SUMMON
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL URU!

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:12.856
UNH!

00:19:12.856 --> 00:19:13.857
HUH?

00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:24.501
I HOPE YOUR BUBBLE
PROTECTS US, LUNA!

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:26.870
WHOA!

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.605
THANKS TO THE SPIDER WEB
FIELD SPELL,

00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:30.841
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL URU
GAINS THE ABILITY

00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:32.409
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:34.144
GO, MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!

00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:37.013
UNLEASH YOUR WEB
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:19:37.013 --> 00:19:38.515
ATTACK!

00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.284
[GASP]
YUSEI!

00:19:41.284 --> 00:19:44.121
I ACTIVATE
SYNCHRO BARRIER!

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.191
HOW?!

00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:50.060
IT WAS SIMPLE, ROMAN.

00:19:50.093 --> 00:19:52.796
ALL I NEEDED TO DO
WAS SACRIFICE
MY JUNK WARRIOR

00:19:52.796 --> 00:19:56.299
IN ORDER TO
ACTIVATE MY TRAP
AND BLOCK YOUR ATTACK!

00:19:56.299 --> 00:19:57.434
[CHUCKLE]

00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:59.402
YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:01.505
I NOW PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN.

00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:03.273
BUT BEFORE
I END MY TURN,

00:20:03.273 --> 00:20:07.244
I'M ACTIVATING
THE DESTINY ACTIVATOR
SPELL CARD!

00:20:07.244 --> 00:20:10.547
NOW ALL I NEED DO
IS DRAW THE TOP CARD
FROM MY DECK

00:20:10.547 --> 00:20:12.549
AND SEND IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:13.850
FROM THIS POINT
FORWARD,

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.653
IF WHAT YOU DRAW
IS THE SAME TYPE
AS THIS CARD,

00:20:16.653 --> 00:20:18.955
THEN YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE CUT IN HALF!

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:20.357
[GROWL]

00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:21.725
AND THE CARD
THAT I HAVE JUST SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:23.059
IS A MONSTER CARD!

00:20:23.093 --> 00:20:24.895
SO MAKE
YOUR NEXT MOVE, YUSEI,

00:20:24.895 --> 00:20:26.496
AND HOPE AGAINST HOPE

00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:29.065
THAT YOU DO NOT
DRAW A MONSTER
FROM YOUR DECK.

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:30.133
[GRUNT]

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:31.768
HERE GOES.

00:20:31.768 --> 00:20:32.836
[CHUCKLE]

00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:34.437
IT'S A TRAP CARD.

00:20:34.437 --> 00:20:36.773
LOOKS LIKE DESTINY
IS TOYING WITH YOU.

00:20:36.773 --> 00:20:38.108
[SIGH]

00:20:38.108 --> 00:20:39.242
THAT'S GOOD.

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:40.877
BUT HE CAN'T
RELAX YET.

00:20:40.877 --> 00:20:43.647
HE'S GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO BEAT THAT
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,

00:20:43.647 --> 00:20:44.881
OR IT'S OVER.

00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:49.319
I SUMMON SPEED WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:51.788
[THINKING]
MY WARRIOR'S NEVER
LET ME DOWN BEFORE,

00:20:51.788 --> 00:20:54.791
BUT HE'S NO MATCH
FOR THAT EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL RIGHT NOW.

00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.761
ROMAN'S LIFE POINTS
ARE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:00.430
I ACTIVATE
SPEED WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.832
ON THE TURN
IT'S SUMMONED,

00:21:01.832 --> 00:21:05.135
ITS ATTACK POINTS
GET A POWER BOOST.

00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:07.270
NOW!
DO IT, SPEED WARRIOR!

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.506
ATTACK ROMAN DIRECTLY!

00:21:09.506 --> 00:21:12.442
YEAH! IF THIS ATTACK SUCCEEDS,
THEN WE'RE ALL GOING HOME!

00:21:12.442 --> 00:21:14.578
NO ONE'S GOING
ANYWHERE!

00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:16.613
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:18.381
ROAR OF THE EARTHBOUND!

00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:21.184
THIS TRAP DESTROYS
YOUR ATTACKING MONSTER,

00:21:21.184 --> 00:21:22.519
AND THEN
DISHES OUT DAMAGE

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:25.222
EQUAL TO HALF
YOUR WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS!

00:21:25.222 --> 00:21:26.523
AAH!

00:21:28.325 --> 00:21:30.827
I PLAY A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:21:30.827 --> 00:21:33.029
IT'S MY MOVE, THEN,

00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:34.998
SO, HOW MANY MORE
DIRECT ATTACKS

00:21:34.998 --> 00:21:36.299
FROM MY EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:38.068
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN AVOID?

00:21:38.101 --> 00:21:39.436
GO, URU!

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:41.771
UNLEASH THE POWER
OF THE SHADOWS!

00:21:43.807 --> 00:21:47.143
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP...
SPIRIT FORCE!

00:21:47.143 --> 00:21:48.345
WITH THIS IN PLAY,

00:21:48.345 --> 00:21:49.913
I CAN AVOID
TAKING ANY DAMAGE

00:21:49.913 --> 00:21:51.581
BY DEFLECTING
YOUR ATTACK,

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:52.816
AND AFTER THAT,

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:54.251
I CAN ADD
A REINFORCEMENT
TO MY HAND

00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:55.752
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:21:55.752 --> 00:21:58.555
ACTUALLY,
YOU WON'T BE DOING
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

00:21:58.555 --> 00:21:59.823
WHAT?

00:21:59.823 --> 00:22:02.225
I ACTIVATE
THE EARTHBOUND WAVE
TRAP CARD!

00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:04.361
WITH THE POWER
OF EARTHBOUND WAVE,

00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:06.162
I CAN NEGATE THE
ACTIVATION AND EFFECT

00:22:06.162 --> 00:22:07.664
OF ONE OF
YOUR TRAP CARDS.

00:22:07.664 --> 00:22:09.232
OH, NO! AAH!

00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:10.533
AAARGH!

00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:13.803
[GROANING]

00:22:13.803 --> 00:22:14.771
Both: YUSEI!

00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:16.907
OH, NO!

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.313
STAND UP, KID.
STAND UP AND RETALIATE.

00:22:23.313 --> 00:22:25.348
FIGHT BACK SO THAT
I CAN THROW YOU
TO THE SHADOWS

00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.350
JUST LIKE I DID
YOUR FATHER.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.451
