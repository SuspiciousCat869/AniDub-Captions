WEBVTT

00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.370
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S"!

00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:05.572
Luna: UM, 5D'S?

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.341
IS THAT LIKE
THE TEAM NAME?

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.308
YEAH.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:09.877
5D'S IS ABOUT
ONE THING--

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.211
THIS RIGHT HERE.

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:12.479
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED
BY THE MARK

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:13.747
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.682
THAT'S WHAT TIES
US ALL TOGETHER.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.917
HANDS IN, PEOPLE.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.886
STARTING RIGHT HERE
AND RIGHT NOW

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:21.021
WE'RE TEAM 5D'S!

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:24.124
All: YEAH!

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.059
Announcer: TEAM 5D'S
TO PRACTICE LANE 2

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.228
FOR YOUR SCHEDULED PRACTICE RUN.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:32.232
OH MAN, I AM LOVING
THE WAY THIS BABY FLIES!

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.734
HUH?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.168
LOOK OUT!!

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.740
UNH!

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.709
WHY DID YOU
HIT HIM, YOU FOOL?

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.211
IT WASN'T
ON PURPOSE, GUY.

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.179
I COULDN'T STOP.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.216
YOU TRIED TO
INJURE MY TEAMMATE!

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:51.952
OH, YOU GUYS ARE
TEAM UNICORN!

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.587
I REALLY AM SORRY.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.955
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.823
NAH. I'M STILL IN
ONE PIECE, RIGHT?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.559
CAN'T SAY THE SAME
FOR YOUR DUEL RUNNER THOUGH.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.994
LOOK AT THAT THING.
THERE'S NO WAY
IT'LL RUN NOW.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.830
THIS WAS OUR FAULT.
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.166
HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU GUYS DUEL
US RIGHT NOW,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.534
AND IF YOU WIN,
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.635
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.005
ABOUT PAYING
FOR ANY DAMAGES.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.707
YOU MADE IT LOOK
SO CONVINCING.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.509
THANKS TO YOUR LITTLE
"ACCIDENT", BREO,

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.444
WE'RE ABOUT TO
GET A SNEAK PEAK

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.580
AT YUSEI'S STRENGTHS
AND WEAKNESSES.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.317
I SUMMON MAX WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.384
GO, GREEN BABOON!

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.254
ATTACK MAX WARRIOR
WITH HAMMER CLUB!

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.793
I RELEASE BOTH
PLAYFUL POSSUM
AND NIMBLE MOMONGA

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.697
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
BEHEMOTH THE KING
OF ALL ANIMALS!

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.931
[ROARS]

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.666
YUSEI CAN TURN
THIS AROUND.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.369
ANDRE HAS THREE
BACK-TO-BACK ATTACKS
READY TO GO.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:44.037
HE CAN'T WIN THIS.

Andre: I HOPE

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:53.840
'CAUSE IT'S
ABOUT TO GET WILD.

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:56.476
LET'S GO! GREEN BABOON,
DEFENDER OF THE FOREST,

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.478
ATTACK JUNK ARCHER!

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.213
[GROWLS]

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.916
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP
CHAIN ARROW!

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:05.052
THIS TRAP GRANTS
A MONSTER BEING ATTACKED

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.721
A TEMPORARY INCREASE
IN POWER!

00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:09.089
THAT MEANS...

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:13.226
THAT MEANS, SINCE
JUNK ARCHER SUCCESSFULLY

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.696
USED CHAIN ARROW TO DESTROY
A MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.597
IT CAN FIRE A COUNTER ATTACK
SHOT THAT LOWERS

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:19.933
ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.537
BY A THOUSAND
UNTIL THE END PHASE
OF YOUR TURN!

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.312
[GROWLS]

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.720
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I AM SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.254
GREAT! NOT
ONLY DID HE AVOID

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.756
JUNK ARCHER'S
DESTRUCTION,

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:45.492
BUT HE MANAGED TO
TEMPORARILY CRIPPLE
ANDRE'S BEHEMOTH.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.094
Luna: AND WITH BEHEMOTH
WEAKENED LIKE THAT,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.596
ANDRE CAN'T ATTACK
JUNK ARCHER ANYMORE
THIS TURN.

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:50.997
Leo: GO TEAM 5-D'S!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.367
I SURE HOPE YUSEI CAN
KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.203
Yusei: NOW THE CHAIN ARROW
EFFECT WEARS OFF,

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.706
AND JUNK ARCHER'S ATTACK
POINTS RETURN TO NORMAL.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:00.741
WELL, WOO-HOO.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.676
WHAT INCREDIBLE
FORESIGHT.

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:05.145
YUSEI REMOVED GREEN BABOON
FROM PLAY USING

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.813
JUNK ARCHER'S ABILITY,
BUT HE KNEW

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.348
THE BIG APE WOULD RETURN
TO THE FIELD

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.083
DURING THE END PHASE
AND THAT ANDRE

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.551
WOULD ATTACK
WITH IT FIRST.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:13.487
SO HE PLANTED A TRAP CARD
THAT WOULD NEGLECT

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.622
THE ATTACK,
DESTROY BABOON PERMANENTLY,

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.758
AND WEAKEN BEHEMOTH
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:19.392
NOT TOO BAD.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.695
WELL, WELL, I MOCKISHLY
DECLARED EARLIER

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:22.829
THAT THERE WERE
GLARING OPENINGS

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:25.599
IN YOUR STRATEGY,
BUT PERHAPS I WAS WRONG.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.802
I TAKE IT BACK
AND HUMBLY APOLOGIZE

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:31.571
BY ACTIVATING
BEAST BURIAL RITUAL!

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:33.607
THIS TRAP LETS ME
DRAW TWO NEW CARDS

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.143
IN EXCHANGE FOR
SENDING ONE MONSTER
FROM MY FIELD

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.811
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.147
SAY GOODBYE TO
NIMBLE MOMONGA!

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.519
ERR.

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.954
Luna: I'M STARTING TO FEEL
BAD FOR THAT NIMBLE MOMONGA.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.524
I'M STARTING TO
FEEL BAD FOR YUSEI.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.926
AS YOU MAY HAVE GUESSED,
WHEN A BEAST-TYPE
MONSTER OF MINE

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:54.861
IS DESTROYED, I CAN
PAY A THOUSAND
LIFE POINTS

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.930
TO GET GREEN BABOON
OUT OF MY GRAVEYARD

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.099
AND BACK ON MY FIELD!

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:02.869
THAT GUY LOVES
HIS MONKEY.

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:05.672
YES, WELL,
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT MONKEY CAN NOW

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.374
OBLITERATE JUNK ARCHER.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.509
WAIT, DO YOU THINK ANDRE
KNEW HE WOULD NEED

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:11.044
THAT TRAP
WHEN HE PLACED IT?

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.646
OF COURSE HE KNEW,
BREO.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.782
IN THAT LAST BATTLE,
IF IT HAD BEEN BUSINESS
AS USUAL FOR ANDRE,

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.084
HE WOULD'VE ATTACKED
WITH BEHEMOTH INSTEAD
OF GREEN BABOON

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.387
CONSIDERING BEHEMOTH
IS SO MUCH STRONGER.

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.522
BUT BY ANTICIPATING
YUSEI'S THINKING,

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.258
ANDRE WAS ABLE TO THINK
A FEW STEPS AHEAD OF HIM.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.694
SO HE TURNED
THE TABLES ON CHAIN ARROW.

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:32.666
HE BASICALLY USED YUSEI'S
TRAP AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DRAW TWO NEW CARDS.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.368
IT REMINDS ME OF HIS DUEL
AT THE ATLANTIS TOURNAMENT,

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.572
WHEN HE WAS ABLE
TO WIN ONLY USING
TRAP CARDS.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:39.940
THAT WAS GREAT.

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.908
ANDRE IS BETTER
THAN ANYONE I KNOW

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.210
AT READING
HIS OPPONENT,

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:44.711
PREDICTING
THEIR EVERY MOVE,

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:46.913
AND THEN USING
THOSE MOVES TO PAVE

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.181
THE ROAD TO VICTORY.

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:49.282
TIME TO FIGHT!

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.918
GREEN BABOON,
TAKE OUT JUNK ARCHER!

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:54.988
[ROARS]

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:57.557
AND NOW, WITH
JUNK ARCHER OUT
OF THE PICTURE,

00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:00.660
BEHEMOTH MOVES IN TO
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:03.129
THIS SHOULD
SHAKE THINGS UP!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.102
NOW I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.871
AND CHAIN ARROW'S
EFFECT WEARS OFF,

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:14.507
RETURNING BEHEMOTH'S
ATTACK POINTS TO NORMAL!

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.112
I WAS PLANNING ON
FINISHING YOU OFF

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:20.647
THIS ROUND,
BUT YOU SOMEHOW

00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.115
MANAGED TO SURVIVE!

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.683
SO MAKE YOUR
NEXT TURN COUNT,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.853
OR YOU'RE GONNA FIND
YOURSELF AT A DEAD END.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.437
Leo: ALRIGHT--
HERE COMES YUSEI'S
BIG COUNTERATTACK!

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:48.508
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:52.078
I SUMMON SHIELD WING
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.782
[THINKING]
THIS IS ALL
I HAVE TO GO WITH.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.550
I HOPE THIS WORKS.

00:06:57.617 --> 00:07:00.787
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:02.989
HUH? THAT'S ALL
HE'S GONNA DO?

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.291
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
BIG MONSTERS

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:05.692
AND EXPLOSIONS, LEO.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.827
HE NEEDS TO
PLAY IT SAFE.

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:10.463
EXACTLY. GOOD DEFENSE
IS THE KEY.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.533
YUSEI IS ACCUSTOMED
TO BATTLING ME
ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.269
WHY IS HE STRUGGLING SO
MUCH AGAINST THIS JOKER?

00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:18.538
MAYBE THIS JOKER
IS BETTER
THAN YOU, JACK.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.473
PRETEND HE DIDN'T
SAY THAT!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.409
LOOK, SHIELD WING IS
PRACTICALLY A WALL,

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:25.478
THAT BIRD CAN USUALLY
WITHSTAND AT LEAST
TWO ATTACKS.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:28.014
EVEN IF ANDRE SUMMONS
A THIRD MONSTER NEXT TURN,

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.951
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO
ATTACK YUSEI DIRECTLY!

00:07:31.017 --> 00:07:32.552
HA! HE'S BASICALLY
GIVING US

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.354
A "HOW TO DEFEAT YUSEI"
HANDBOOK

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.956
FOR WHEN
THE TOURNAMENT STARTS.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:37.657
IT'S AN INFORMATIVE READ,
BUT ANDRE NEEDS TO

00:07:37.724 --> 00:07:38.992
WRAP IT UP.

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:40.994
IF HE STRETCHES THIS
THING OUT MUCH LONGER,

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:42.629
THEY'RE GONNA
GET SUSPICIOUS.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:46.666
THIS IS IT.
NO MORE GOING
EASY ON THIS GUY.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.201
IT'S MY TURN!

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:53.673
I SUMMON
NIMBLE MOMONGA!

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.508
THEN I SUMMON
ONE BEAST-TYPE MONSTER

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:57.243
FROM MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.179
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
THE EGOTISTICAL APE

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:01.748
TUNER MONSTER
TO THE FIELD!

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.587
EGOTISTICAL APE'S LEVEL
INCREASES BY THE LEVEL

00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:08.855
OF THE MONSTER
THAT WAS SENT

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:10.890
TO THE GRAVEYARD
TO SUMMON IT!

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:16.363
UH-OH, ANDRE'S
GOT FOUR MONSTERS.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.898
TWO TO CHIP AWAY
AT SHIELD WING'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.166
A THIRD ONE
TO DISH OUT

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.469
THE FINISHING BLOW,
LEAVING THE FIELD WIDE OPEN.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:24.270
FOR MONSTER NUMBER
FOUR TO MOVE IN,

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.873
ATTACK DIRECTLY,
AND SEND YUSEI HOME.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.907
THIS IS BAD!
THIS IS BAD!

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.209
Yusei: BEFORE YOU
GO ANY FURTHER,

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.944
I REVEAL ONE
OF MY TRAP CARDS--

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.379
IT'S SHIELD COAT!

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:34.114
WHEN YOU SUMMON A MONSTER
MORE POWERFUL THAN

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.349
A MONSTER I HAVE
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:39.619
I CAN USE SHIELD COAT
TO DOUBLE MY MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS!

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.557
YES! NOW IT'LL TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.726
A FREAKY FLYING SQUIRREL
AND A FUNNY-LOOKING MONKEY

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.395
TO DESTROY SHIELD WING!

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.031
NICE TRY, BUT MY LEVEL 7
EGOTISTICAL APE

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:54.401
IS TUNING MY
LEVEL 2 NIMBLE MOMONGA!

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.269
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS
GOING TO TRY TO ONE-TWO

00:08:56.336 --> 00:08:58.705
YOUR MONSTER WITH
THOSE WEAK CRITTERS,
DID YOU?

00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:00.040
I'M GONNA LET
THE KING OF THE JUNGLE

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.541
TAKE YOUR
SHIELD WING OUT.

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:05.345
SAY HELLO TO
NATURIA GAODRAKE!

00:09:05.412 --> 00:09:08.481
[ROARS]

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.251
Computer: NATURIA GAODRAKE IS
A LEVEL 9 BEAST-TYPE

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:16.156
MONSTER WITH 3000 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1800 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.924
WHAT IS THAT,
A DANDELION?

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:19.859
HE TOTALLY KNEW THAT
YUSEI HAD A TRAP CARD

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:21.961
READY THAT WOULD
BOOST HIS MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS.

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.397
HE WAS JUST WAITING
FOR HIM TO PLAY IT.

00:09:24.464 --> 00:09:26.232
BUT BY COMBINING
TWO OF HIS MONSTERS,

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.735
HE'S NOW ONE MONSTER
SHY OF WINNING.

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:33.440
BABOON! GET IN THERE
AND CLOBBER YUSEI'S
SHIELD WING!

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:34.841
[SCREECH]

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:41.581
ALRIGHT, BEHEMOTH--
YOUR TURN!

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.316
AND NOW, TO SEAL
THE DEAL--

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:47.120
NATURIA GAODRAKE POUNCES
IN FOR A THIRD ATTACK!

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.093
YUSEI'S COMPLETELY
VULNERABLE NOW.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.794
THE GOOD NEWS IS--
ANDRE DOESN'T HAVE

00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:57.397
ANY MORE MONSTERS
HE CAN ATTACK
HIM WITH.

00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:01.534
MY PREDATOR IS STILL
ON THE HUNT, YUSEI..

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.870
I ACTIVATE
HOWL OF THE WILD!

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:05.972
WHEN A BEAST-TYPE
MONSTER OF MINE DESTROYS

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.108
YOUR MONSTER IN BATTLE,
HOWL OF THE WILD CAN

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:10.176
SLAM YOU FOR 300 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.545
FOR EVERY BEAST
ON MY FIELD!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.713
AW, NO.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.914
"AW NO" IS RIGHT!

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.549
SEE WITH THREE BEASTS
ON MY FIELD YOU'LL BE

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.953
TAKING 900 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:10:22.088 --> 00:10:26.126
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:10:26.192 --> 00:10:27.494
Leo: GUESS ANDRE DIDN'T
NEED ANOTHER MONSTER

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.962
TO ATTACK WITH.

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:30.830
YEAH. HE'S GOT YUSEI
ON THE ROPES.

00:10:30.897 --> 00:10:32.132
THIS GUY IS AWESOME.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.435
HE REMINDS ME OF ME
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.103
[THINKING]
THIS BATTLE'S AMAZING.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.872
I KNOW I'M NEW
AT TURBO DUELING,

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:42.275
BUT WILL I EVER BE ABLE
TO DUEL AT THIS LEVEL?

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.913
I HOPE SOMEDAY I'LL
HAVE THE CHANCE.

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:58.358
IT'S MY TURN!

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.729
NICE.

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.764
I SUMMON DEBRIS DRAGON!

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.535
AND WHEN I MANAGE TO
BRING DEBRIS DRAGON

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:10.904
TO MY FIELD, I CAN
THEN SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.439
FROM MY GRAVEYARD AS LONG
AS IT HAS LESS

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.042
THAN 500 ATTACK POINTS,
AND SHIELD WING

00:11:16.109 --> 00:11:18.411
FITS THE BILL PERFECTLY!

00:11:18.478 --> 00:11:20.947
NOW DON'T BOTHER MOCKING
SHIELD WING'S STRENGTH,

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.482
'CAUSE IT WON'T BE
STICKING AROUND.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:25.451
YOU SEE. SINCE I'M ROCKING
6 SPEED COUNTERS RIGHT NOW,

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:29.822
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO
ACTIVATE THE VISION WIND
SPEED SPELL FROM MY HAND!

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.090
AND WITH THAT,
I CAN SUMMON ONE

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.726
LEVEL 2-OR-BELOW MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.429
WELCOME BACK,
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:40.733
AND NOW MY LEVEL 2
SPEED WARRIOR

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.169
AND MY LEVEL 2 SHIELD WING
WILL BOTH GET A TUNING

00:11:43.236 --> 00:11:46.172
FROM MY LEVEL 4
DEBRIS DRAGON!

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.884
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
YOUR DEFEAT!

00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:00.954
NOW COME FORTH,
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.207
HE PLAYED
STARDUST DRAGON!!

00:12:21.274 --> 00:12:23.676
LOOK. HIS TOP MONSTER
HAS FINALLY SHOWED UP,

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:26.112
AND IT CAN'T
EVEN COMPETE
WITH GREEN BABOON.

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:28.681
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO
WITH THAT WRANGLY REPTILE?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:33.586
NOW! STARDUST DRAGON
ATTACK GREEN BABOON
WITH COSMIC FLARE!

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.121
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:37.790
GREEN BABOON
HAS MORE ATTACK
POINTS, YUSEI.

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:40.693
THAT'S WHY I'M ACTIVATING
THE SYNCHRO STRIKE TRAP!

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.362
WITH THIS CARD, FOR EVERY
MONSTER THAT WAS USED

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.597
TO SUMMON IT,
STARDUST DRAGON GAINS

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:46.966
AN ADDITIONAL
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.369
SO NOW IT HAS
FOUR THOUSAND
ATTACK POINTS!?

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.970
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:56.776
AW, YEAH!

00:12:56.843 --> 00:12:58.211
NOW WHO'S LOW
ON LIFE POINTS!?

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.912
THIS IS GREAT,
'CAUSE YUSEI'S GOT

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.114
SIX SPEED COUNTERS
RIGHT NOW,

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.349
SO ALL HE NEEDS IS
A SPEED SPELL

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:04.484
AND HE CAN DRAIN
THE REST OF ANDRE'S

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.953
LIFE POINTS FASTER THAN
LEO DRAINS A MILKSHAKE.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.023
WHOA. CHECK OUT
THE PLAY-BY-PLAY
COMING FROM AKIZA!

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:12.225
YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE
A REAL TURBO DUELIST!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:14.427
HEH HEH.

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.929
10, 9, 8...

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.899
NOW I'M ACTIVATING
THE EFFECT OF SPEED WORLD 2!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.901
WITH THIS CARD YOU TAKE
800 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:24.671
FOR EVERY SPEED SPELL
THAT I'M CURRENTLY
HOLDING IN MY HAND!

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.873
[BUZZER]

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.308
WHAT IS THIS?

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.709
IT LOOKS LIKE OUR
PRACTICE TIME IS UP.

00:13:29.776 --> 00:13:31.644
I GUESS
THE DUEL IS A DRAW.

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:32.879
HUH?

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:41.554
NICE DUELING WITH YOU.

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:43.656
YEAH, UH, NICE
DUELING WITH YOU.

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:46.259
WE'LL HAVE TO SETTLE THIS
IN THE PRELIMINARIES.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.827
SEE YA' ON THE TRACK.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.464
THAT WAS SWEET!

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:52.465
YOU HAD THAT GUY!

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.100
YOU TOTALLY
WOULD'VE WON THAT!

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:55.635
NOT QUITE.

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:58.771
HE STILL HAD A FACEDOWN
CARD ON HIS FIELD.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.740
AND BASED ON THE WAY
HE WAS DUELING,

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:04.043
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF THAT CARD WAS
A GAME CHANGER.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.712
SO EVEN AT THAT POINT,
YOU THINK HE WAS

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:07.113
A STEP AHEAD OF YOU?

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.681
PROBABLY.

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:09.882
SO YOU WOULD'VE GONE
IN AND HE WOULD'VE

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.552
COUNTERATTACKED
AND THAT WOULDA
BEEN THAT.

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:15.521
WHO KNOWS,
BUT THOSE GUYS ARE GOOD.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:17.190
IT'S GONNA TAKE
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.859
TO BEAT THEM
IN THE TOURNAMENT.

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:21.761
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF THOSE LOUTS.

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.396
THEY WILL PLAY
INTO MY HAND,

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:26.399
AND THEN I'LL CRUSH THEM
LIKE THE LITTLE BUGS
THAT THEY ARE.

00:14:26.466 --> 00:14:27.834
YEAH, WE'LL
TAKE THEM DOWN!

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.571
TEAM UNICORN IS GONNA
BE TEAM STINKY CORN!

00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:34.407
IT'LL TAKE "EVERYTHING
THEY'VE GOT" TO BEAT
TEAM UNICORN?

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:35.942
I HAVE NEWS FOR THEM--

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:37.944
IF THEY THINK
THOSE "PREPSTERS"
ARE A CHALLENGE,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.712
THEY SHOULD JUST
FORFEIT NOW.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:41.914
MAYBE SOMETHING BAD
WILL HAPPEN TO ONE OF THEM

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:43.683
THAT FORCES
THEM TO FORFEIT.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.618
YEAH. MAYBE SO.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.487
[ALL LAUGHING]

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.106
OOH, NICE! THAT'S HIS
FASTEST TIME YET!

00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:09.876
Sherry: I COULD'VE
BEATEN THAT!

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.244
SHERRY?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.945
I THOUGHT I WOULD SWING
BY AND SAY BONJOUR

00:15:13.012 --> 00:15:15.481
SINCE WE WON'T BE MEETING
IN THE PRELIMINARIES.

00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:17.417
THEY'VE PUT US
IN DIFFERENT DIVISIONS.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.419
DO YOU KNOW WHO
YOU'RE UP AGAINST
IN THE FIRST ROUND?

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:22.188
SOME BUNCH
CALLING THEMSELVES
THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:23.923
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THEM.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.992
I AM, HOWEVER, WORRIED
ABOUT SOME

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.760
OF THE OTHER
PARTICIPANTS.

00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:30.730
I FEAR THEY MAY BE
WORKING WITH ILIASTER.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.231
YOU SHOULD BE
CAREFUL, AKIZA.

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.200
IN FACT,
ALL OF YOU SHOULD.

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:35.234
Yusei: SAME TO YOU,
SHERRY.

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.203
DON'T GO CHASING
AFTER DANGER.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.639
I AM NOT "CHASING
AFTER DANGER," YUSEI.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.774
IT IS DANGER THAT
IS CHASING ME.

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:44.877
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH,
YOU AND I SHOULD DISCUSS

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.146
WHAT WE SAW THE OTHER
DAY AT THE HEADQUARTERS

00:15:47.213 --> 00:15:50.116
OF THE PUBLIC
SECURITY BUREAU.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:54.787
UNTIL THEN...

00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:56.989
KEEP YOUR WITS
ABOUT YOU, YUSEI FUDO,

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.225
AND BE READY
FOR ANYTHING!

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.093
AU REVOIR!

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:06.399
Crow: MARTHA!
BLISTER.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.533
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.734
TRAFFIC WAS A PAIN.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.304
GOODNESS SAKE!
IT'S SO NICE TO
SEE YOUR FACES!

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.972
COME ON IN!

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:16.275
Blister: WHERE'S YUSEI?
I THOUGHT HE WAS
COMING WITH YOU.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:17.710
OH. YEAH, WELL,
NO DICE.

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:19.479
HE DECIDED TO RAIN CHECK
THIS VISIT.

00:16:19.545 --> 00:16:21.514
HE WANTED TO DO SOME
MORE PRACTICE RUNS

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:23.149
DOWN AT THE PIER.

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:24.917
ALLOW ME TO
TRANSLATE THAT FOR YOU.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.186
HE WANTED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH AKIZA

00:16:27.253 --> 00:16:28.721
DOWN AT THE PIER.

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:30.590
AT LEAST HE'S
DOING SOMETHING
CONSTRUCTIVE.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.025
I HEARD FROM ZORA
THAT A CERTAIN
SOMEONE CAN'T

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:34.727
SEEM TO HOLD DOWN
A JOB!

00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.996
HMM? I REJECT
THAT STATEMENT,

00:16:37.063 --> 00:16:38.865
AND I WON'T COMMENT ON IT.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.400
HUH?

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.436
I JUST REALIZED
HOW QUIET IT IS.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.770
THE KIDS NOT HERE?

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.706
IT'S TIME TO COME OUT,
YOU GUYS!

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.808
[GIGGLING]

00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.510
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,
YA' LITTLE BRATS?

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:52.745
WERE YOU HIDING
FROM ME?

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:55.081
[LAUGHING]

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:59.352
HUH? DID--DID YOU

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.153
THEY STAYED UP 'TIL 3 A.M.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.455
I COULDN'T GET THEM
TO GO TO BED.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.992
THEY WANTED TO FINISH
IT BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:07.927
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT LIKE
A FLAG AND BRING IT

00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.762
TO THE TOURNAMENT AND CHEER
REALLY LOUD FOR YOU

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:10.963

SO IF YOU'RE EVER
FEELING ALL RUMBLED...

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.901
JUST LOOK UP

Martha: YOU KNOW, JACK,
MAYBE IF YOU SMILED
MORE OFTEN,

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.589
SOMEBODY WOULD
MAKE SOMETHING
LIKE THAT FOR YOU.

00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:38.157
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN!?

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.393
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:01.581
SMELLS GREAT.

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.849
I'M SURPRISED CROW'S

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.618

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:07.620

[SCREAMING]

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:40.286
OH, MAN.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.656

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:47.126
UH, NO WAY.

00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:48.961
I DISLOCATED

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:50.329
UH, YUH.

ABOUT A MONTH

MAYBE TWO.

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:53.933
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.002
THE PRELIMINARIES
ARE IN THREE DAYS.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.169
I CAN DUEL, RIGHT?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.904
I MEAN, I'M FINE,
I FEEL PERFECT,

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:00.172
NEVER FELT BETTER.

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:01.540
YOU CAN'T DUEL.

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.009

WHATEVER YOU WANT!

00:19:05.945 --> 00:19:07.313
I'VE GOTTA HAVE
THE CHANCE TO WIN

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.748
THAT TOURNAMENT

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.483
COME ON. HELP ME MAKE
THIS HAPPEN, DOC.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.351
TELL ME I CAN
STILL DUEL.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:14.320
I WOULD IF YA' COULD,
BUT YA' CAN'T!

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.889
AND I AM NOT ABOUT
TO SIGN OFF ON YOUR
RELEASE FORM.

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:18.290
YOU'RE JUST A QUACK!

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.092
I DON'T NEED YOUR
QUACKY PERMISSION,

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:22.261
AND I DON'T NEED
YOUR BANDAGES!

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.262
AAH!

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.731
STOP THAT.

00:19:25.798 --> 00:19:28.501
WHY? WHY NOW?

00:19:30.803 --> 00:19:34.373
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO
TELL THE LITTLE NERDS!?

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:44.383
SO JUST THE TWO
OF US, THEN?

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.851
ACCORDING TO
THE TOURNAMENT RULES,

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.553
IF THREE PEOPLE ENTER,
THE TEAM GETS

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.188
TWELVE-THOUSAND LIFE POINTS,
BUT IF IT'S ONLY

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:53.125
TWO PEOPLE, THEN THE TEAM
ONLY GETS EIGHT-THOUSAND
LIFE POINTS.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.495
WOW. THAT'S
A REALLY BIG HANDICAP.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:58.664
SHOULD WE JUST
WITHDRAW NOW?

00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:01.000
NO. I MEAN, WE'VE
COME THIS FAR.

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:02.935
WE CAN'T BACK DOWN NOW.

00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:04.603
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE
CAN'T DO--

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.605
WE CAN'T ENTER KNOWING
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:11.811
I DUEL TO WIN
OR I DON'T DUEL
AT ALL, YUSEI.

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:14.146
Akiza: UM, BOYS?

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.949
WE'RE ALL PART OF
TEAM 5D'S, AREN'T WE?

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:18.484
LET ME DUEL WITH YOU.

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:19.485
REALLY?

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:21.320
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR IT?

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:23.556
MM-HMM.

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.291
THAT'S NOT
THE WORST IDEA
I'VE EVER HEARD.

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:26.425
I MEAN, SHE'S
A SHARP DUELIST.

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:28.060
SHE KNOWS
YOUR STRATEGIES.

00:20:28.127 --> 00:20:30.796
I'VE STILL GOT A LOT
TO LEARN ABOUT
TURBO DUELING.

00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:32.331
I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.066
BUT LIKE YOU'RE ALWAYS
SAYING, YUSEI,

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:36.135
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED
BY A BOND.

00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:38.904
WE CAN DO THIS
TOGETHER.

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:39.939
HMM?

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.440
HEY! WHERE YA'
GOIN', CROW?

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:43.943
WHAT'S IT MATTER?
I'M CLEARLY
REPLACEABLE.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.978
WHO CARES
WHERE I GO!?

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.636
[THINKING]
AM I READY FOR THIS?

00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:13.305
COME ON, AKIZA STOP
ASKING YOURSELF THAT.

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:17.409
YOU HAVE TO BE READY
FOR JACK AND YUSEI.

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:20.346
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.614
HUH?

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.718
Yusei: NO SIGN OF CROW
OR HIS DUEL RUNNER.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.386
I GUESS HE DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:28.654
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.489
HE SEEMED SO
UPSET WHEN HE LEFT.

00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:32.124
HE'S JUST PLAYING UP
THE DRAMA LIKE THE MANCHILD

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:34.927
HE IS,
BUT HE'S OUR MANCHILD.

00:21:34.994 --> 00:21:36.862
SO LET'S GO FIND HIM!

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:43.669
NO SIGN OF AKIZA

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:45.905
I GUESS SHE WAS
ALL TALK.

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:49.842
DON'T HESITATE!

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:51.243
TAKE THOSE CURVES
WITH FULL FORCE,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.813

HUNH! HOW DARE
THEY MAKE US WORRY!

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:03.122
I WONDER IF THEY'VE BEEN
PRACTICING ALL NIGHT?

00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:05.691
ALRIGHT! YOU ARE GONNA
TEAR THE ROAD UP, AKIZA.

00:22:05.758 --> 00:22:09.495
