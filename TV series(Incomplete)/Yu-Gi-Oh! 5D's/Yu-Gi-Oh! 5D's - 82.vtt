WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S"!

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.940
SORRY I'M A BIT LATE,
TRAFFIC WAS A BEAST.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.408
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:13.746
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
YOU WANT THIS.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.047
HERE.

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.383
FINALLY THE PROGRAM
IS MINE...

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:18.818
AND ALL OF ITS MIGHT.

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.555
YOU WERE FOLLOWED.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.390
NO! I WAS SURE
I SLIPPED THEM.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.493
SLIPPED THEM?
THEN YOU KNEW?

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.896
SO YOU'VE COME TO TAKE BACK
YOUR PROGRAM, HAVE YOU?

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.365
GOOD LUCK.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.700
YOU'LL NEED IT HERE
IN MY DOMAIN.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.172
AAH!

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.541
LAZAR!

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.643
UH-OH.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.646
WHAT IS THAT?

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.081
Guard Robot:
PREMISES LOCK-DOWN COMPLETE.

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.718
YUSEI FUDO, THE ONLY WAY TO
OVERRIDE LOCK-DOWN
PROTOCOL SYSTEMS

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.421
IS BY DEFEATING ME IN A DUEL.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:01:00.326
Primo: NOW THE TIME HAS AT LAST
COME FOR YOU TO AWAKE, MY PETS.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.162
THE TIME HAS COME
TO GIVE YOU LIFE.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.105
Guard Robot: IT IS TIME TO DUEL.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:14.774
[THINKING] AND IF I PLAN TO GET
OUT OF THIS ROOM

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.509
IN TIME TO FIND OUR PROGRAM,

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.377

THIS MAKES NO SENSE...

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.045
THE WHOLE PLACE...
IT'S LOCKED DOWN!

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.080
ARE YOU SURE THAT WE'RE
IN THE RIGHT SPOT?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.517
YEAH. THIS IS WHERE
BRUNO SAID TO GO.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.487
BUT NOW...I CAN'T EVEN
GET A HOLD OF HIM.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:35.755
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.593

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.528
AWAKEN, MY PETS.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.166
LET THE PROGRAM TAKE HOLD...

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.402
THERE'S NO ONE
WHO CAN STOP US NOW.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.804
THEY'LL TRY...

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.406
BUT I'VE MADE CERTAIN
THAT THEY'LL FAIL!

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:01.847
THAT GUARD BOT SURE HAS
PUT YUSEI IN A BIND...

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.784
WITH THAT LOCK DRAGON
AND THE SPELL LEVEL LIMIT--
AREA B

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.719
BOTH OUT ON THE FIELD...

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.722
YUSEI'S NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE
ANY SPECIAL SUMMONINGS

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.459
NOR CAN HE ATTACK WITH
ANY OF HIS HIGH LEVEL MONSTERS!

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.094
[THINKING] THAT BOT
BOUGHT HIMSELF SOME TIME

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:18.097
BY STOPPING ME FROM
USING MY BEST WEAPONS,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:21.567
BUT IF I TIME THINGS RIGHT,
THAT COULD ALL CHANGE.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.937
TO END MY TURN...
I THROW A FACEDOWN.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.705
IT IS NOW MY TURN TO GO

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.675
AND I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
SUMMON PASS.

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.277
DUE TO SUMMON PASS,

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.112
WHEN EITHER OF US
SUMMONS A MONSTER,

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:35.781
THE OTHER PLAYER MUST
THEN DRAW ONE CARD.

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.583
THE FIRST PLAYER
THEN HAS TO GUESS

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.218
WHAT TYPE OF CARD IT IS.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.653
IF THE GUESS IS DIFFERENT

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.321
FROM THE CARD THAT
HIS OPPONENT DREW,

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.324
THE MONSTER THAT WAS
SUMMONED IS DESTROYED.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.692
ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS,

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:49.161
THE ODDS OF YOU
NOW SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONING A MONSTER

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:53.365
ARE DECREASED BY 15%.

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:55.334
THIS IS AWFUL!
SO NOW YUSEI

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.803
CAN'T EVEN SUMMON MONSTERS
FOR CERTAIN?!

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.005
I NOW PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.807
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.944
[THINKING] THAT BOT HAS 5 CARDS
IN ITS SPELL AND TRAP CARD ZONE

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.046
AND EACH ONE IS
MEANT TO STALL ME.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.714
AND THE LONGER THIS DUEL GOES,

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:10.583
THE MORE COUNTERS
ARE ACCUMULATED

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:11.884
AND ONCE THERE ARE 4,

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.887
COUNTER FORCE WILL TAKE OUT
ALL MY LIFE POINTS.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.356
SO IF I'M GONNA STOP
THIS CAST IRON COMPUTER,

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.091
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO IT QUICK.

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:20.826
IT'S MY DRAW!

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:24.930
AND FIRST, I'M GONNA
SWITCH LEVEL EATER
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.432
THEN FROM MY HAND,

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.201
I PLAY THE SPELL CARD
SYNCHRO GIFT!

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.637
THIS ALLOWS ME TO TAKE
ALL THE ATTACK POINTS

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.505
OF ONE OF MY
SYNCHRO MONSTERS

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.341
AND ADD THEM ONTO
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.509
OF ONE OF MY
REGULAR MONSTERS!

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.511
SO GO JUNK WARRIOR!

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.647
LEND YOUR POWER
TO LEVEL EATER!

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:43.716
BRILLIANT!

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.584
SINCE LEVEL EATER
IS JUST A LEVEL 1,

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.554
IT'S NOT AFFECTED BY THE SPELL
LEVEL LIMIT--AREA B!

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.490
AND WITH THE POWER UP
IT CAN DESTROY LOCK DRAGON!

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.760
LEVEL EATER!
TAKE FLIGHT AND ATTACK!

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:59.198
I ACTIVATE A COUNTER
TRAP...NEGATE ATTACK!

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.432
YOU WHAT?!

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:02.735
DUE TO THIS CARD,
YOUR ATTACK IS NEGATED,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.170
AND THE BATTLE PHASE
IMMEDIATELY ENDS.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.509
ALSO, DUE TO THE ACTIVATION
OF NEGATE ATTACK,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.811
COUNTER FORCE'S
EFFECT ACTIVATES...

00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.647
AN EFFECT THAT GIVES ME
ONE COUNTER

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.549
WHENEVER A COUNTER TRAP
IS PLAYED.

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.985
WHICH MEANS THAT BOT
IS ONE COUNTER CLOSER

00:05:19.985 --> 00:05:21.887
TO WIPING OUT
MY LIFE POINTS

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:25.758
AND HE'S STILL GOT
A FACEDOWN ON HIS FIELD
LEFT TO PLAY...

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.960
THE EFFECT OF
SYNCHRO GIFT IS OVER--

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.363
BOTH MY MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS
NOW RETURN TO NORMAL.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:34.633
SO IT WAS ALL FOR NAUGHT!?

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:37.269
THE SPELL CARD, HAVING THAT
LEVEL EATER ATTACK?

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:38.737
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THE ONLY THING

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.139
THIS TURN ACCOMPLISHED WAS...

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.441
TO GIVE THAT BOT
ANOTHER COUNTER?!

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:43.976
OH, THIS IS BAD.

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:50.316
NOT EXACTLY THE FRONT DOOR
BUT IT'LL HAVE TO DO.

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:55.888
MY DRAW.

00:05:57.456 --> 00:06:00.759
I PLACE ONE FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.962
[THINKING] ANOTHER
FACEDOWN TO
CONTEND WITH?

00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:05.798
LOOKS LIKE THE TIME'S
STILL NOT RIGHT

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.132
TO PLAY MINE THEN...

00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:09.368
AFTER ALL, IF ONE OF
THOSE FACEDOWNS

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:11.704
NEGATE WHAT I HAVE
PLANNED, I'M FINISHED.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:14.306
I'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A
WAY TO GET RID OF THEM.

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.412
I KNEW YUSEI WOULDN'T
STAND A CHANCE...

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:22.247
Jakob: PRIMO!

00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:23.415
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:25.718
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO!

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.554
WHAT I'M UP TO IS NONE OF
YOUR CONCERN, JAKOB.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.688
SO BUTT OUT!

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.457
IF WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE DOING

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:34.793
AFFECTS THE GRAND DESIGN,
THEN SO HELP ME PRIMO...

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:37.262
WHY, OF COURSE IT AFFECTS
THE GRAND DESIGN!

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:40.132
IT WILL HELP REALIZE IT,
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

00:06:40.132 --> 00:06:41.367
WAIT, PRIMO!

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.672
AH...IT IS DONE.

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:49.108
NOW...AWAKEN MY CHILDREN!

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:53.278
AWAKEN AND TAKE TO THE STREETS
OF NEW DOMINO CITY!

Lester: OH I KNOW ...

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.447
HE'S THE GUY WHO
ALWAYS TICKS YOU OFF!

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.149
[SNICKERING]

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.551
THIS IS NOTHING
TO JOKE ABOUT, LESTER.

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:34.153
CHILL OUT, JAKOB.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:36.121
PRIMO HAS THE SAME GOAL
WE ALL DO--

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:37.489
TO MAKE
THE CIRCUIT APPEAR

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.757
AND HAVE IT ACTIVATE.

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:41.393
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,
HE WANTS TO
FAST-TRACK IT--

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.729
NOT WAIT FOR YOU TO
SLOWLY TRICK THE SIGNERS

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.831
INTO SOMEHOW
SUMMONING IT FOR US.

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.967
SO HIS BIG SOLUTION
IS THIS DUEL BOT ARMY?

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:51.070
HOW DOES HE EVEN
KNOW THIS PROGRAM

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.639
THAT THE SIGNERS
WERE DEVELOPING
IS GOING TO WORK?

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.408
THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY
THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG!

00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:59.445
YES, BUT THAT'S ALL
PART OF THE FUN,
DON'TCHA THINK?

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.314
FUN?!
YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:05.284
I MEAN, WHO REALLY CARES
WHAT KIND OF PANIC
WE CAUSE?

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:07.653
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.888
THE CIRCUIT IS GOING TO
APPEAR AND WHEN IT DOES,

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:11.657
NONE OF THIS
WILL MATTER.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:15.260
IT MATTERS--THE GRAND DESIGN
IS A FAR MORE FRAGILE THING

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.462
THAN YOU MAKE IT OUT TO BE.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.764
WOULD YOU JUST QUIT
WORRYING ABOUT IT?

SELF-DESTRUCT IN 10 MINUTES.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.011
ADVISE THAT ALL PERSONS VACATE
THESE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:42.948
REPEAT: THIS FACTORY WILL
SELF-DESTRUCT IN 10 MINUTES.

00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:46.385
ADVISE THAT ALL PERSONS VACATE
THESE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY...

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.819
WHERE'S YUSEI?

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:49.054
THERE--IT'S DONE.

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:53.492
GOOD RIDDANCE YOU PESTS--
ENJOY YOUR LAST MOMENTS.

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.662
NOW THEN...
I REALLY MUST BE GOING.

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.038
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BLOW
IN 10 MINUTES?!

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.073
[GASP] ACTUALLY, NOT EVEN!

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:09.775
THE CLOCK'S ALREADY TICKING!

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:13.445
AND WE'RE...LOCKED UP
IN THIS LITTLE ROOM!!!

00:10:16.748 --> 00:10:19.117
YUSEI?! YUSEI?!

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:23.121
WHERE COULD HE BE--
AND WHERE ARE JACK AND CROW?

00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:25.057
THIS IS THE LONGEST
HALLWAY EVER!

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.125
HEY! I SEE
A ROOM UP AHEAD!

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.529
LOOK--IT'S BRUNO!

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.097
CROW!

00:10:32.097 --> 00:10:33.465
ARE YOU OK?

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:34.533
I THINK SO.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.201
SOMEONE KNOCKED ME
ON THE HEAD PRETTY GOOD--

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.202
I'M NOT SURE WHO.

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:38.470
WHERE IS YUSEI?

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.205
I DON'T KNOW--
WE GOT SPLIT UP...

00:10:40.205 --> 00:10:42.374
NUTS! WE GOTTA
FIND HIM!

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.810
THEN I SAY
WE HEAD UP THERE.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.045
LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND
OF CONTROL ROOM.

00:10:47.045 --> 00:10:48.347
MAYBE THERE'S A LAYOUT
OF THIS PLACE

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:49.815
THAT'LL HELP US
FIND YUSEI!

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.216
Crow: ALRIGHT, LET'S GO!

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.721
Jack: THIS IS
NO CONTROL PANEL.

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.556
IT'S A COUNTDOWN
TIMER...

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:00.025
YEAH AND THERE'S
NOT MUCH TIME LEFT!

00:11:15.104 --> 00:11:18.006
THIS SELF-DESTRUCT MECHANISM
IS SET TO GO OFF IN MINUTES!

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:19.141
CAN YOU STOP IT?

00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:20.476
OR BUY US SOME TIME?

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.444
I'M TRYING, I'M TRYING...

00:11:22.444 --> 00:11:25.380
ONLY...THE KEYBOARD'S
NOT RESPONDING!

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.381
GAH!

00:11:26.381 --> 00:11:27.382
HUH?
HUH?

00:11:27.382 --> 00:11:28.684
IT'S YUSEI!

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:30.486
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S DUELING...

00:11:30.486 --> 00:11:31.987
A GIANT ROBOT?

00:11:31.987 --> 00:11:34.223
LOOKS LIKE LAZAR'S
THERE WITH HIM, TOO!

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:35.491
HUH?

00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:38.293
YUSEI?!
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:11:38.293 --> 00:11:39.294
Jack: I THINK HE CAN!

00:11:39.294 --> 00:11:40.796
Crow: YUSEI,
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:11:40.796 --> 00:11:42.931
JACK? CROW? BRUNO?

00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:45.067
Jack: YEAH, IT'S US!
BUT WHAT ARE YOU
DOING DUELING?

00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:47.369
DON'T YOU KNOW?
THIS WHOLE PLACE
IS ABOUT TO BLOW!

00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:49.037
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE.

00:11:49.037 --> 00:11:50.906
WELL--
OF COURSE WE KNOW!

00:11:50.906 --> 00:11:52.207
BUT WE'RE STUCK HERE!

00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:53.609
Crow: WELL, GET UNSTUCK!

00:11:53.609 --> 00:11:55.277
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH TIME LEFT!

00:11:55.277 --> 00:11:57.279
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, CROW...

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:01.750
THIS ROOM IS
ON LOCK DOWN UNLESS
I WIN THIS DUEL.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.585
IT'S ON WHAT?!

00:12:03.585 --> 00:12:04.653
LOCK DOWN?!

00:12:04.653 --> 00:12:07.089
THEN JUST BEAT THAT
BUCKET OF BOLTS ALREADY!

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:08.857
THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE!

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:12.294
THIS BOT'S MADE IT SO YUSEI
CAN BARELY EVEN MAKE A MOVE!

00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:14.229
SO TIME IS NOT ON OUR SIDE!

00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:16.365
Yusei: FORGET ABOUT ME!
YOU GUYS JUST GO!

00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:17.399
WHAT?

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:20.469
NO WAY--WE'RE NOT
LEAVING YOU BEHIND!

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:23.172
JUST TRUST ME...
I'M GONNA BE ALL RIGHT...

00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:24.339
[GASP]

00:12:25.941 --> 00:12:28.110
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ABOUT ME?!

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.278
I'M HERE TOO!

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:31.113
PLEASE--MY FRIENDS,
COME RESCUE ME!

00:12:31.113 --> 00:12:33.949
Yusei: I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING!
NOW JUST GO!

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:35.584
BUT YUSEI...

00:12:35.584 --> 00:12:38.320
[GRUMBLES] FINE THEN...

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.255
CROW, BRUNO, LET'S GO.
WE'RE LEAVING.

00:12:40.255 --> 00:12:42.024
NO WAY--I'M STAYING HERE.

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:43.125
IF YOU WANNA GO, FINE.

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:44.326
[GROWLS]

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:45.494
GUH!

00:12:45.494 --> 00:12:48.463
THAT HURT--WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM?!

00:12:48.463 --> 00:12:49.865
YOU THINK THIS
IS EASY FOR ME?!

00:12:49.865 --> 00:12:51.900
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
MY FRIEND IN THERE!

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.368
SO WHY LEAVE?!

00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:54.570
BECAUSE, BRUNO...

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.405
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN YUSEI.

00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:59.107
HUH? BELIEVE?

00:12:59.107 --> 00:13:01.109
MM-HMM.

00:13:01.109 --> 00:13:05.581
OK...IF YOU SAY SO.

00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:06.582
Lazar: BELIEVE?!...

00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:08.817
YUSEI, WE'LL SEE
YOU OUTSIDE.

00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:11.053
Yusei: YEAH. NOW JUST
GET GOING ALREADY.

00:13:11.053 --> 00:13:13.288
Jack: YUSEI--YOU HAD BETTER
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

00:13:13.288 --> 00:13:16.058
GOOD LUCK--
NOW HURRY UP AND WIN!

00:13:16.058 --> 00:13:18.460
Yusei: RIGHT. THAT'S THE PLAN.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.631
I HAVE MONEY!
I'LL PAY YOU!
NO--PLEASE DON'T GO!

00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:25.400
[SIGHS] THAT'S IT,
WE'RE GONERS, RIGHT?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.435
Yusei: WRONG.

00:13:26.435 --> 00:13:28.470
I SAID I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING...

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:29.705
AND I DO.

00:13:30.939 --> 00:13:32.608
[THINKING]
THE QUESTION IS,

00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:35.344
CAN I DO IT
FAST ENOUGH...

00:13:35.344 --> 00:13:37.112
DON'T WORRY, BRUNO,
IF THERE'S ANYONE

00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:39.681
WHO CAN GET OUT OF A JAM
LIKE THIS, IT'S YUSEI.

00:13:39.681 --> 00:13:41.283
RIGHT--HE WOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD US
TO LEAVE

00:13:41.283 --> 00:13:42.618
UNLESS HE HAD
SOMETHING PLANNED.

00:13:42.618 --> 00:13:44.319
THAT'S RIGHT MATE,
AND IF WE DIDN'T LEAVE

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:45.354
IT WOULD MEAN THAT
WE DIDN'T BELIEVE

00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:46.788
HE COULD DO WHAT
HE SAID HE COULD.

00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:47.990
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP
IS ALL ABOUT

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.024
BELIEVING IN
EACH OTHER--

00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:51.460
CUZ WHEN YA BELIEVE...
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.028
IT'S MY TURN!

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.067
I THINK I GET IT NOW...
BY US LEAVING...

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:01.136
YUSEI CAN FOCUS
ON WINNING!

00:14:01.136 --> 00:14:03.205
I SUMMON DRILL SYNCHRON!

00:14:04.906 --> 00:14:08.243
AT THIS MOMENT, THE EFFECT
OF SUMMON PASS ACTIVATES.

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:10.812
BECAUSE YOU SUMMONED A LEVEL
4-OR-BELOW MONSTER,

00:14:10.812 --> 00:14:12.714
I DRAW ONE CARD
AND YOU HAVE TO GUESS

00:14:12.714 --> 00:14:14.916
THE TYPE OF CARD IT IS.

00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.919
IF THE CARD TYPE I DREW IS
DIFFERENT FROM YOUR GUESS,

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:19.888
DRILL SYNCHRON
IS DESTROYED.

00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:21.390
HERE IS MY DRAW...

00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:24.559
THEN I SUPPOSE
HERE'S MY GUESS...

00:14:26.695 --> 00:14:28.897
[WHINES]

00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:31.099
I GUESS TRAP CARD!

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:32.234
CORRECT.

00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:37.239
ALRIGHT! FINALLY LUCK
IS ON OUR SIDE!

00:14:37.239 --> 00:14:40.575
YOU'RE WRONG, LAZAR,
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH LUCK...

00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:43.645
THIS GUARD BOT'S DECK
IS BASED ON USING
COUNTER TRAPS...

00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:47.249
CRUNCH THE NUMBERS
AND THE ODDS CLEARLY
FAVOR A TRAP CARD TYPE.

00:14:47.249 --> 00:14:51.053
ALRIGHT! FINALLY,
PROBABILITY IS ON OUR SIDE!

00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:54.856
NEXT UP, A SPELL!
GO BLIND SPOT STRIKE!

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:56.925
NOW, UNTIL THE END
PHASE OF THIS TURN,

00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:59.161
THE ATTACK POINTS OF
A MONSTER ON MY FIELD

00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:00.562
INCREASE BY
THE DEFENSE POINTS

00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:03.065
OF A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE
ON YOUR FIELD!

00:15:03.065 --> 00:15:05.667
YES! NOW YOU CAN POWER UP
THAT DRILL SYNCHRON

00:15:05.667 --> 00:15:07.502
AND TAKE IT TO THAT
METAL MENACE!

00:15:07.502 --> 00:15:10.939
INCORRECT, I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP MAGIC JAMMER.

00:15:10.939 --> 00:15:12.274
WHAT?!

00:15:12.274 --> 00:15:14.676
NOW BY DISCARDING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND

00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:17.446
I CAN NEGATE AND DESTROY
YOUR SPELL CARD.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.949
ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO
THE ACTIVATION

00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:23.352
OF THE COUNTER TRAP
MAGIC JAMMER,

00:15:23.352 --> 00:15:24.986
COUNTER FORCE'S
EFFECT ACTIVATES

00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:27.222
AND GIVES ME
AN ADDITIONAL COUNTER.

00:15:27.222 --> 00:15:28.690
THAT MAKES 3 COUNTERS!

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.258
NOW THINGS ARE
REALLY HOPELESS--

00:15:30.258 --> 00:15:32.260
WE'RE GONERS FOR SURE!

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.162
[WHINES] AT LEAST
MY NAME WILL BE

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:36.798
CARRIED ON BY
MY FAMILY...[HUMS]

00:15:36.798 --> 00:15:38.934
MY NAME...AND MY HAIR.

00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:42.204
OH, I REMEMBER WHEN
WE ALL GOT OUR FIRST PERMS...

00:15:42.204 --> 00:15:44.039
IT IS MY TURN.

00:15:45.273 --> 00:15:47.876
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL
MESSENGER OF PEACE

00:15:47.876 --> 00:15:48.977
FROM MY HAND.

00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:51.179
NOW, NEITHER PLAYER
CAN ATTACK WITH MONSTERS

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:53.949
THAT HAVE 1500-OR-MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:56.118
OH NO--
ANOTHER RESTRICTION?

00:15:56.118 --> 00:15:58.920
SO MUCH FOR POWERING UP
MY LOW LEVEL MONSTERS

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.188
TO WAGE AN ATTACK,

00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:01.957
NOW I'M NOT EVEN
ALLOWED TO DO THAT!

00:16:01.957 --> 00:16:04.760
YUSEI FUDO,
THE PROBABILITY
OF YOU LOSING

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.096
DURING MY NEXT TURN
IS...90%.

00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:09.898
MY DRAW!

00:16:09.898 --> 00:16:13.935
YUSEI! DON'T FORGET--
THE CLOCK IS TICKING!

00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.872
[THINKING] HOW COULD
I FORGET...
WITH EACH PASSING SECOND

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:19.174
WE'RE THAT MUCH CLOSER
TO CERTAIN DOOM.

00:16:19.174 --> 00:16:20.776
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET
OUT OF THIS ROOM

00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:22.744
AND OUT OF THIS FACTORY
IN ONE PIECE,

00:16:22.744 --> 00:16:26.047
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS DRAW...

00:16:26.047 --> 00:16:28.216
DOUBLE CYCLONE...
WITH THIS,

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:29.217
I CAN DESTROY CARDS

00:16:29.217 --> 00:16:30.652
IN THE SPELL AND TRAP
CARD ZONES

00:16:30.652 --> 00:16:32.354
ON BOTH SIDES
OF OUR FIELDS.

00:16:32.354 --> 00:16:33.789
WHICH MEANS,
BY PLAYING IT,

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:36.224
I WOULD BE ABLE TO
DESTROY THAT BOT'S
COUNTER FORCE

00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:37.993
ALONG WITH ITS
3 COUNTERS.

00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:40.128
IT'S THE ONLY MOVE
I HAVE TO MAKE...

00:16:40.128 --> 00:16:41.830
SO HERE GOES...

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.567
I PLAY A SPELL...
GO DOUBLE CYCLONE!

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:47.169
NOW YOUR TRAP,
COUNTER FORCE,

00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:49.571
WILL FACE THE FIERCE
FORCES OF NATURE

00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:51.106
AND AFTER THIS STORM...

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:52.707
THERE WON'T BE
ANYTHING LEFT!

00:16:52.707 --> 00:16:54.843
I ACTIVATE A COUNTER TRAP.

00:16:54.843 --> 00:16:56.178
SOLEMN JUDGMENT.

00:16:56.178 --> 00:16:59.481
SOLEMN JUDGMENT?
BUT THAT MEANS...

00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:00.782
WITH SOLEMN JUDGMENT,

00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:02.617
BY PAYING HALF OF
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:05.053
I CAN NEGATE
THE SUMMONING
OF A MONSTER,

00:17:05.053 --> 00:17:07.088
THE USE OF A TRAP
OR, IN THIS CASE,

00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:09.024
THE ACTIVATION OF A SPELL.

00:17:11.993 --> 00:17:15.864
NO! IT'S OVER!
AND I'M SO YOUNG!

00:17:15.864 --> 00:17:18.934
NOW THE EFFECT OF
COUNTER FORCE ACTIVATES.

00:17:20.902 --> 00:17:24.906
WHICH MEANS I RECEIVE
AN ADDITIONAL COUNTER.

00:17:24.906 --> 00:17:26.708
WHICH MEANS
NEXT TURN THAT BOT

00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:29.211
IS GOING TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:32.481
NICE KNOWING YOU, WORLD.
SEE YA LATER!

00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:35.684
THE PROBABILITY OF
YUSEI FUDO LOSING
THIS DUEL

00:17:35.684 --> 00:17:38.153
IS...100%.

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.827
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHECK YOUR MATH.

00:17:45.827 --> 00:17:46.928
WHAT?

00:17:46.928 --> 00:17:49.397
[GROANS] WHAT?

00:17:49.397 --> 00:17:50.966
PLAYING THAT
DOUBLE CYCLONE

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.334
WAS THE ONLY MOVE I HAD

00:17:52.334 --> 00:17:53.802
BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY
WAY TO GET YOU

00:17:53.802 --> 00:17:55.437
TO THROW THAT
COUNTER TRAP...

00:17:55.437 --> 00:17:56.471
WHAT?

00:17:56.471 --> 00:17:57.472
AND...IT WAS

00:17:57.472 --> 00:17:59.407
JUST THE TRAP
I'D HOPED FOR.

00:17:59.407 --> 00:18:02.143
YOU SEE, I KNEW YOU WERE
PLANNING TO DEFEAT ME

00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:04.045
WITH COUNTER FORCE
NEXT TURN...

00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:07.315
SO, I KNEW YOU'D DO
WHATEVER YOU HAD TO
TO PROTECT IT,

00:18:07.315 --> 00:18:09.985
INCLUDING USING A CARD
LIKE SOLEMN JUDGMENT.

00:18:09.985 --> 00:18:12.521
YOU CALCULATED
THAT PAYING
HALF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:18:12.521 --> 00:18:14.289
WOULDN'T MATTER BECAUSE
I WOULDN'T BE AROUND

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:15.590
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF IT--

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.260
BUT YOU
CALCULATED WRONG.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:19.828
FAILURE TO COMPUTE.

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:22.197
WELL, SEE IF
YOU CAN COMPUTE THIS:

00:18:22.197 --> 00:18:24.165
GO, LEVEL EATER,
YOU'RE RELEASED...

00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:27.536
SO THAT I CAN SUMMON
EARTHQUAKE GIANT!

00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:35.076
Duel Runner Computer: WHEN THE
MONSTER CARD EARTHQUAKE GIANT

00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:36.545
SWITCHES BATTLE MODES,

00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:38.480
A MONSTER ON YOUR
OPPONENT'S FIELD

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.749
MUST SWITCH
BATTLE MODES AS WELL.

00:18:40.749 --> 00:18:42.684
YUSEI FUDO,
DUE TO THE EFFECT

00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:44.252
OF LEVEL LIMIT--AREA B,

00:18:44.252 --> 00:18:45.854
ALL LEVEL
4-AND-ABOVE MONSTERS

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:47.889
MUST SWITCH
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:49.491 --> 00:18:51.359
Yusei: FINE BECAUSE
THAT ACTIVATES

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:53.528
EARTHQUAKE GIANT'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:53.528 --> 00:18:55.597
SO GET READY,
CAUSE YOUR LOCK DRAGON'S

00:18:55.597 --> 00:18:58.033
ABOUT TO GET SHAKEN
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:05.173
[LOCK DRAGON SNARLS]

00:19:05.173 --> 00:19:07.275
AH, THAT DRAGON'S
NOT NEARLY AS TOUGH

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:08.810
WHEN HE'S NOT IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.312
FINALLY, THE TIMING
IS RIGHT

00:19:10.312 --> 00:19:12.280
TO PLAY THE FACEDOWN
I'VE BEEN SAVING!

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.817
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP CARD...
PANIC WAVE.

00:19:15.817 --> 00:19:18.286
WITH IT, BY DESTROYING
ONE CARD ON MY FIELD

00:19:18.286 --> 00:19:20.789
I CAN NEGATE THE EFFECTS
OF ALL FACEUP CARDS

00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:22.390
FOR THE ENTIRE TURN!

00:19:26.227 --> 00:19:28.463
NOW, LEVEL 3
DRILL SYNCHRON

00:19:28.463 --> 00:19:30.865
TUNE WITH LEVEL 5
JUNK WARRIOR!

00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:35.003
BEHOLD--AS
THE COSMOS CREATES

00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:37.005
A MONSTER
OF GALACTIC MIGHT!

00:19:37.005 --> 00:19:39.541
BEHOLD AS I
SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.576
THE STARDUST DRAGON!

00:19:42.844 --> 00:19:45.146
[ROARS]

00:19:45.146 --> 00:19:47.415
AHH! HIS ULTIMATE BEAST!

00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:50.819
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT, YUSEI!

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:53.355
IN THIS SCENARIO
SINCE YUSEI FUDO

00:19:53.355 --> 00:19:54.956
SUMMONED STARDUST DRAGON,

00:19:54.956 --> 00:19:57.792
THE PROBABILITY OF HIM
WINNING IS...100%.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:19:59.894
ATTACK WITH
ALL YOUR MIGHT!

00:19:59.894 --> 00:20:01.896
[ROARS]

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:07.702
YUSEI FUDO WINS.

00:20:07.702 --> 00:20:10.572
ROOM LOCKDOWN
IS REVERSED.

00:20:12.574 --> 00:20:14.609
Duel Runner Computer: ATTENTION:
THIS FACTORY WILL...

00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:18.513
LET'S GO!
YOU SAID IT! RUN!!!

00:20:18.513 --> 00:20:25.053
Duel Runner Computer:
10...9...8...7...6...5...

00:20:25.053 --> 00:20:27.288
THERE, UP AHEAD,
I SEE THE EXIT!

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:29.391
AND THIS IS
GONNA BE CLOSE!

00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:31.292
Duel Runner Computer: 1...0.

00:20:56.918 --> 00:20:58.853
[ALL SHOUTING]

00:21:07.796 --> 00:21:08.863
[GROANS]

00:21:08.863 --> 00:21:10.932
YUSEI...

00:21:10.932 --> 00:21:12.467
WHERE IS HE?

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:13.768
IT CAN'T BE!

00:21:25.747 --> 00:21:26.748
[GASPS]

00:21:26.748 --> 00:21:28.316
Crow: LOOK--UP THERE!

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.221
YUSEI!

00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:35.056
NOW THAT'S BLOWING UP.

00:21:35.056 --> 00:21:37.225
YOU WERE RIGHT TO BELIEVE
IN YUSEI, JACK.

00:21:37.225 --> 00:21:39.427
YEAH...I KNOW.

00:21:39.427 --> 00:21:41.696
ALWAYS KEEP
A SPARE BALLOON...

00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:43.064
THAT'S WHAT I SAY!

00:21:43.064 --> 00:21:46.367
LAZAR...YOU ARE TRULY
ONE IN A MILLION.

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:47.902
AND IT WAS
A MILLION TO ONE SHOT

00:21:47.902 --> 00:21:50.538
THAT WE WERE GOING TO BEAT
THAT BOT AT HIS OWN GAME.

00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:52.373
THANKS FOR
SAVING THE DAY.

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:54.709
AND THOUGH I'D LOVE
TO STAY AND CHAT...

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:56.945
I REALLY MUST BE LEAVING!

00:21:56.945 --> 00:21:59.814
WAIT! WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH OUR PROGRAM?!

00:21:59.814 --> 00:22:02.183
PROGRAM? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:22:02.183 --> 00:22:03.885
ARGH!

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:06.688
TRUST ME, YUSEI,
IT'S FAR BETTER
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:22:06.688 --> 00:22:08.389
YOU SIMPLY HAVE NO IDEA

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:10.125
WHO AND WHAT
YOU'RE UP AGAINST!

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:12.393
MY ADVICE IS
TO JUST LET IT GO

00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:14.395
AND FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:17.332
SERIOUSLY! I'M NOT
FULL OF HOT AIR HERE!

00:22:17.332 --> 00:22:18.800
GET IT?
HOT AIR?!

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.968
LIKE A BALLOON?!

00:22:19.968 --> 00:22:21.236
[LAUGHS]

00:22:21.236 --> 00:22:23.872
[THINKING] LET IT GO AND FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED?

00:22:23.872 --> 00:22:25.907
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:22:25.907 --> 00:22:27.275
Crow: YUSEI!

00:22:30.545 --> 00:22:32.814
[THINKING] I MAY NOT KNOW
WHO I'M UP AGAINST...

00:22:32.814 --> 00:22:34.883
BUT I KNOW WHO I STAND WITH.

00:22:34.883 --> 00:22:37.852
AND WE'RE NOT BACKING DOWN.
