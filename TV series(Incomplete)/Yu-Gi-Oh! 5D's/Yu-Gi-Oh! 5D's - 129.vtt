00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:33.406

BOTH PLAYERS TAKE DAMAGE

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:07.774

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:08.775
SAY WHAT?

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:11.144

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:14.614
BECAUSE, LEO,
DURING THE BATTLE PHASE

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.250
OF YUSEI'S NEXT TURN,
FENRIR FORCES MONSTERS

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.786
FROM <i>DEFENSE</i> TO OFFENSE,
WHICH MEANS THAT...

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.423
WHICH MEANS THAT
JORMUNGANDR SWITCHES TO OFFENSE

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.992
AND YUSEI TAKES
3000 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.460
-OH, NO!
-WHAT?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.830

FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.634

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:39.606
THIS IS BAD.

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.075
GJALLARHORN'S COUNTER HAS JUST

I PLAY THE TRAP,

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.035
BY GETTING RID OF
1000 OF THEM,

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:11.037
I'M THEN ALLOWED

FOR EVERY 1000-POINT DIFFERENCE
IN OUR LIFE POINTS.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.310
AND SINCE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN US IS MORE THAN 3000,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.181
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW
THREE CARDS FROM MY DECK.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:24.584

A TITANIC RISK HERE.

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:27.187
IF HE CAN CAPTURE THE CARDS HE
COVETS, WILL IT BE WORTH IT?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.454
WE'LL SEE.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:31.624
AFTER ALL, HE HAS NOW JUST 200
LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:32.692

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:35.762

-OH, NO.
-YUSEI.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.731
THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.234
HALLDOR'S SPEED COUNTER
IS STILL AT ONE,

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:43.369
WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO WAY HE
CAN PLAY AN EFFECT

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.104
THAT'LL TAKE OUT
YUSEI'S LAST POINTS.

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:46.206
THAT'S TRUE.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.874
BUT SINCE ON HALLDOR'S
NEXT DRAW,

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.943
GJALLARHORN'S EFFECT
WILL ACTIVATE,

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:54.714

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.805
AND SINCE IT'LL BE FOR THE THIRD
TIME, YUSEI'S OUT OF TIME.

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:22.341
THINK YUSEI HAS WHAT
IT TAKES TO WIN, CROW?

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:26.245
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK, I THINK
WE'RE ALL ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:32.118
♪

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:43.429
♪

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.765
Yusei: <i>IT ALL COMES DOWN</i>
<i>TO THIS LAST ROUND,</i>

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:48.134
<i>AND I WOULDN'T HAVE IT</i>
<i>ANY OTHER WAY.</i>

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:49.602
BRING IT ON, HALLDOR.

00:17:49.602 --> 00:17:52.204
AREN'T YOU PEPPY FOR SOMEONE
WHO IS ABOUT TO LOSE.

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.606
IF I LOSE,

00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:56.742
AT LEAST I'LL KNOW I DID
EVERYTHING I COULD TO WIN.

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:57.777
OH, PLEASE.

00:17:57.777 --> 00:17:59.812
THAT'S THE WAY FAILURES SPEAK.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.548
BUT I SUPPOSE THAT FITS,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAILED.

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:05.117
AND NOW I'M GOING TO
MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:07.787
THEN, AT LONG LAST,
ALL OF THE WORLD WILL

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:10.323
RECOGNIZE SOMETHING AS
AN IRONCLAD FACT.

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.794
AND THAT IS...

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:17.897
THE NORDIC GODS CAN DEFEAT
ALL WHO OPPOSE THEM,

00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:20.399
EVEN YOUR FLEDGLING SYNCHROS.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.500
OBSERVE.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.037
I SUMMON TYR
OF THE NORDIC CHAMPIONS.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:32.278
Computer: When Tyr of the Nordic
Champions is released,

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.146
the Nordic gods
cannot be affected

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:38.417
by spells, traps,
or special abilities.

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:42.221
NEXT I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP CARD ODIN'S EYE.

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.957
NOT <i>THAT</i> CARD.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.693
NOW HE'LL SEE RIGHT THROUGH
YUSEI'S HAND AGAIN.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:50.429
Halldor: REMEMBER, YUSEI, YOU
CAN'T NEGATE THE ACTIVATION

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:53.899
OF ODIN'S EYE WHEN A GOD
IS ON THE FIELD.

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:56.769
OF COURSE, I HAVE TO NEGATE
MY GOD'S ABILITIES

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:00.306
IN ORDER TO USE ODIN'S EYE, BUT
THAT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.876
NEXT UP, I PLAY TYR'S ABILITY.

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:06.345
NOW BY RELEASING TYR,
ANY ATTACKS YOU WERE

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:10.282
THINKING OF THROWING MY WAY
WON'T DO MY GODS ANY HARM.

00:19:10.282 --> 00:19:12.518
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE PENALTY THAT COMES

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:15.287
WITH USING ODIN'S EYE
IS NOW GONE.

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:18.124
I LOVE IT WHEN HE SAVES HIS BEST
MOVES FOR LAST.

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:21.360
NOW, THEN, BY THE DIVINE POWER
OF ODIN'S EYE,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.064
LET'S SEE THAT FACEDOWN.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.966
JUST WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:29.835
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP,
TRICK MIRROR.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.071
DUE TO THIS CARD,
WHEN YOUR TRAP ACTIVATES,

00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:35.608
I CAN ACTIVATE ITS EFFECT
AS THOUGH IT WAS MY OWN.

00:19:35.608 --> 00:19:37.677
AND THE TRAP EFFECT
THAT I'LL BE TAKING

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.246
IS THAT OF ODIN'S EYE.

00:19:40.246 --> 00:19:47.319
♪

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.121
OH, NO!

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:52.291
AND THIS MEANS YOUR GOD'S
ABILITIES ARE NEGATED ONCE MORE.

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.160
Halldor: FINE, WHAT'S IT MATTER?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.563
EVEN WITHOUT HIS ABILITY,
ODIN HAS 4000 ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.165
WHICH IS MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO TAKE DOWN

00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.133
YOUR SHOOTING STAR DRAGON.

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.736
BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:05.171
ODIN, ATTACK!

00:20:05.171 --> 00:20:08.107
I PLAY SHOOTING STAR
DRAGON'S ABILITY.

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:10.676
NOW BY REMOVING SHOOTING STAR
DRAGON FROM PLAY

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:13.813
DURING YOUR TURN, THE ATTACK OF
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS IS NEGATED.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.182
SO WHAT?

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:18.017
YOUR FIELD
IS NOW EMPTY, YUSEI.

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:21.887
I'LL SIMPLY HAVE ONE OF MY OTHER
TWO GODS ATTACK YOU NOW.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.990
HMM, I PLAY
THE TRAP ZERO FORCE.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.693
NOW, HALLDOR, BECAUSE
MY MONSTER LEFT THE FIELD,

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.829
YOUR THREE NORDIC GODS
ARE ABOUT TO LOSE

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:32.865
ALL OF THE POWER AND MIGHT
THEY EACH POSSESS.

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.400
THAT CAN'T BE.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:36.335
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.605
BUT IF THEIR POINTS ARE ZERO,

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.741
THEY CAN NO LONGER ATTACK.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.143
AND DON'T FORGET, AT THE END
PHASE OF THIS TURN,

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.779
THE EFFECT OF YOUR
GJALLARHORN TRAP ACTIVATES.

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.381
AND THAT MEANS ALL MONSTERS
ON <i>YOUR</i> FIELD

00:20:49.381 --> 00:20:52.618
WILL BE REMOVED FROM PLAY
AND THAT I TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:55.254
TO THE COMBINED ATTACK POINTS
OF THOSE MONSTERS.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.990
HOWEVER, SINCE THE ATTACK POINTS
OF YOUR THREE GODS

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.792
NOW TOTAL JUST ZERO,

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:02.762
I WON'T BE TAKING ANY
DAMAGE AT ALL.

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:05.197
NO WAY.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:07.466
NOT FAIR.

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.902
YUSEI'S OUTMANEUVERED THE GODS.

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:12.004
AND SINCE THE GODS HAVE BEEN
REMOVED FROM PLAY,

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.539
HALLDOR CAN'T BRING THEM BACK.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.874
All: HUH?

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:17.376
NOW THAT WE'VE REACHED
THIS TURN'S END PHASE,

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:21.347
SHOOTING STAR DRAGON
RISES AGAIN.

00:21:21.347 --> 00:21:23.516
AND WITH HIS RISE
COMES YOUR FALL.

00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:25.551
NOW GO, SHOOTING STAR.

00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:26.552
ATTACK!

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:29.522
(EXPLOSIONS)

00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:31.690
(HALLDOR CRIES IN PAIN)

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:35.995
WE'RE FAILURES.

00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:37.463
(BRODOR GROWLS)

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.732
MC: SIMPLY SENSATIONAL.

00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:40.933
THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:42.401
YUSEI HAS DONE IT.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:46.739
AND NOW, IT'S OFF TO
THE FINALS FOR TEAM 5D'S.
