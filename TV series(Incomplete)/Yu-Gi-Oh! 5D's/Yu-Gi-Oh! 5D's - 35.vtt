WEBVTT

00:00:01.394 --> 00:00:02.996
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO
SPEED WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5Ds."

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:04.497
Kalin: YUSEI!

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:06.899
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.501
[SNORTS]

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:09.502
OH!
OH!

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:10.703
Yusei: KALIN KESSLER?

00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:12.305
YOU WERE ONCE OUR FRIEND!

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:13.973
"ONCE YOUR FRIEND," YES.

00:00:13.973 --> 00:00:16.542
BUT NOW... YOUR ENEMY!

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.080
Carly: JACK,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.650
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU KNOW THAT GUY
DOWN THERE WITH YUSEI.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.084
HE'S FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:27.020
WE USED TO
ALL DUEL TOGETHER.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.090
YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR THE POWER
OF MY DARK DECK, YUSEI!

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.826
NOW PREPARE TO MEET THE SHADOWS
OF THE NETHERWORLD!

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:37.096
I SUMMON
ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON!

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:39.966
AH!

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.468
YUSEI!

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:45.571
THE POWERS OF THE DARK SHADOWS
REALLY SUIT ME!

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.574
DUELS ARE MUCH MORE EXCITING
WHEN I CAN DISH OUT REAL PAIN!

00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:50.176
AH!

00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:52.078
Kalin: I COULD HAVE
GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING!

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:53.880
BUT YOU WERE TOO SCARED!

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.349
YOU KNEW THE ONLY WAY
THE SATELLITE COULD BE OURS

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:58.418
WAS IF WE ELIMINATED
EVERY THREAT.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.687
YOU WERE BLINDED
BY YOUR DREAM!

00:01:00.687 --> 00:01:04.557
NOW THAT I KNOW
YOU DUEL TO DESTROY,
I'M TAKING YOU OUT!

00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:05.992
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:08.961

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:26.839
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
WHERE'S YUSEI?

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:27.874
THERE!

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.717
WOAH, HE'S DUELING!?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.252
HE'S NOT JUST
DUELING, YOU GUYS,

00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:40.653
HE'S TURBO
DUELING...

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:42.355
SO WHO'S
THE OTHER GUY?

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:43.723
Crow:
IT'S KALIN.

00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:46.192
AS IN "LET'S TAKE OVER
SATELLITE" KALIN?

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:49.162
I THOUGHT THEY
LOCKED HIM UP AND
THREW AWAY THE KEY.

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:51.164
LOOKS LIKE THEY
DIDN'T THROW IT
FAR ENOUGH.

00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:54.300
IS HE THE ONE BEHIND
THE BIG GLOWING
THING IN THE SKY?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.701
Crow: YUP.

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.804
REMEMBER THOSE DARK SIGNERS
YUSEI WAS TALKING ABOUT?

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:59.505
APPARENTLY, KALIN
IS ONE OF 'EM.

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:01.240
AND HE USED SOME SORT
OF DARK MOJO

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.243
TO TRAP YUSEI IN THIS SEAL
AND FORCE HIM TO DUEL,

00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:05.945
ONLY THIS ISN'T LIKE
OTHER DUELS.

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:07.847
THE DAMAGE IN THIS DUEL
IS REAL.

00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:08.881
AH!
HUH?

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:12.819
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR PRECIOUS DUEL RUNNER

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.320
IS ABOUT TO GIVE UP
ON YOU, YUSEI!

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:17.356
OH!

00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:19.091
IT'S FINE, KALIN...

00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.127
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
WOBBLY IS ALL.

00:03:21.127 --> 00:03:23.129
THEN I GUESS IT'S
A PERFECT FIT FOR YOUR GAME!

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.598
All: YUSEI!

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.235
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:32.071
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF
LOYAL FRIENDS OUT THERE

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:33.573
WATCHING THE DUEL.

00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:35.575
I JUST HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE
THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO FEEL

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.677
THE STINGING PAIN
OF THEIR BETRAYAL.

00:03:37.677 --> 00:03:41.113
Jack: KALIN CAN RUN THE TABLE
WITH THIS COMBO OF HIS.

00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:44.250
HE'S MADE IT SO THAT AS LONG
AS HE HAS NO CARDS IN HIS HAND,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.552
HE CAN PRETTY MUCH USE
ANY MONSTER IN HIS GRAVEYARD

00:03:46.552 --> 00:03:48.087
AND ACTIVATE
THEIR SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:03:48.087 --> 00:03:51.357
YUSEI NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT OR HE'S FINISHED.

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:54.093
IT'S MY TURN!

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:59.098
I'VE ONLY GOT ONE WAY
TO THROW HIM OFF
HIS STRATEGY...

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.168
IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT
I GOTTA TRY SOMETHING.

00:04:02.168 --> 00:04:03.936
ALRIGHT, KALIN,

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:05.638
SINCE YOU'VE
GOT MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD

00:04:05.638 --> 00:04:06.839
AND MY FIELD
IS EMPTY...

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.275
I'M ABLE TO SPECIAL
SUMMON THIS NEXT CARD

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.010
AS A LEVEL 4 MONSTER!

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.646
I SUMMON LEVEL WARRIOR!

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:20.920
NEXT, I'LL BRING OUT
HYPER SYNCHRON

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.655
TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.530
Computer:
WHEN HYPER SYNCHRON IS USED
TO SUMMON A SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.867
THAT MONSTER GAINS 800 ATTACK
POINTS AND CANNOT BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.402
I'M SHAKING!

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:39.238
AND NOW
I'LL USE THE POWER
OF MY HYPER SYNCHRON

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:43.309
TO TUNE MY LEVEL WARRIOR
SO THAT I CAN SUMMON
OUT YOUR DESTRUCTION!

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:50.216
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.251
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:54.954
BUSTING OUT YOUR DECK'S
TOP PERFORMER!

00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:57.056
I WAS WORRIED YOU WEREN'T
TAKING ME SERIOUSLY!

00:04:57.056 --> 00:04:59.926
I GUESS IN A WAY
I SHOULD BE FLATTERED.

00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:03.129
WEL, THIS NEXT MOVE'LL
REALLY MAKE YOU FEEL
SPECIAL!

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.332
SEE WHEN HYPER SYNCHRON
IS USED TO SUMMON
A SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:09.201
THE SUMMONED MONSTER
THEN GETS POWER BOOST!

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:10.803
THATTA BOY!

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:13.105
I BET EVEN WITH
ONE HUNDRED-EYED
DRAGON ON THE FIELD

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:15.341
KALIN NEVER
SAW THAT COMING!

00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:16.709
GO GET 'EM,
YUSE!

00:05:16.742 --> 00:05:19.645
BUT KALIN CAN STILL
ACTIVATE LOTS OF ABILITIES.

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.718
STARUST DRAGON,
ATTACK WITH
COSMIC FLARE!

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.222
ATTACK ALL YOU WANT BECAUSE
NOW MY ONE HUNDRED-EYED

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:33.559
DRAGON GAINS THE SPECIAL
ABILITY OF INFERNITY GUARDIAN!

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:37.229
AND THANKS TO THIS POWER,

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.031
IT CAN'T BE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE!

00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:42.268
THAT MAY BE, BUT YOUR
LIFE POINTS ARE STILL
GONNA TAKE SOME DAMAGE!

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:43.436
AAAAAARGH!

00:05:45.004 --> 00:05:46.439
[SNICKERS]

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.975
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
FINALLY HITTING BACK.

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:52.979
I KNOW THAT'S NOT ALL
YOU'VE GOT, YUSEI,
WHAT'S NEXT, HUH?!

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.216
SINCE STARDUST DRAGON
MANAGED TO SUCCESSFULLY
DEAL BATTLE DAMAGE,

00:05:57.216 --> 00:06:00.553
THE SHARD OF HOPE
TRAP CARD AUTOMATICALLY
ACTIVATES.

00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:03.456
WHICH MEANS I CAN
NOW DRAW ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK...

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:05.358
AND IF THAT CARD
IS A TRAP CARD,

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:07.927
THEN I CAN ACTIVATE IT
BY DESTROYING
SHARD OF HOPE.

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.931
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO THIS...

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:18.304
NICE!

00:06:18.304 --> 00:06:20.139
HERE GOES EVERYTHING!

00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:27.346
I'M DESTROYING THE CARD
SHARD OF HOPE SO THAT
I CAN ACTIVATE...

00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:30.650
THE POWER OF
MY MIRACLE LOCUS TRAP!

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.819
THIS TRAP FORCES YOU
TO DRAW ONE CARD...

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.722
AND GIVES
STARDUST DRAGON
1,000 MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:40.059
AND THE ABILITY TO
ATTACK FOR A SECOND
TIME THIS TURN!

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:42.461
SO ADD A CARD
TO YOUR HAND, KALIN.

00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:44.630
HMPH.
WITH PLEASURE.

00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:50.703
ALL RIGHT,
THERE WE GO!

00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:52.672
NOW THAT KALIN'S GOT
A CARD IN HIS HAND,

00:06:52.672 --> 00:06:54.240
THAT COMBO HE BUILT
IS USELESS.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.708
AND SO ARE
THE ABILITIES

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.243
OF THE MONSTERS
IN HIS GRAVEYARD!

00:06:57.243 --> 00:07:01.113
STARDUST DRAGON, TIME
TO INFLICT ANOTHER
DOSE OF DAMAGE...

00:07:01.113 --> 00:07:02.581
ATTACK!

00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:08.387
ARGH!

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:10.990
ALL RIGHT!

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.459
AND THE ONE HUNDRED-EYED
DRAGON GOES DOWN!

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:16.796
AND THAT "MEANS KALIN'S
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A NEW GAMEPLAN.

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:18.898
THANKS FOR THE HELP YUSEI,

00:07:18.898 --> 00:07:20.900
BECAUSE NOW THAT YOUR MONSTER
DESTROYED MY MIGHTY BEAST,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.135
I CAN SELECT ONE CARD
IN MY DECK

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:25.237
AND THEN ADD IT TO MY HAND.

00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:32.611
IT WON'T MATTER
'CAUSE NOW I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP!

00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:34.313
SYNCHRO DESTRUCTOR!

00:07:34.313 --> 00:07:36.649
NOW WHEN MY DRAGON
DESTROYS YOUR MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:39.585
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO HALF THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:41.520
AND THEN IF THE
MONSTER I DESTROYED

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.589
WAS A SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.825
YOU GET HIT AGAIN
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT
OF DAMAGE!

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:49.295
SO KALIN'S BASICALLY
GETTING SERVED HIS OWN
DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS...

00:07:49.295 --> 00:07:51.931
SO THAT'S, WHAT?
LIKE THREE-THOUSAND?

00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:53.199
IF THIS MOVE
IS SUCCESSFUL...

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.301
YUSEI WINS THIS THING!

00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:57.670
I'VE NEVER SEEN A COMBO
SO PERFECTLY EXECUTED.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.238
HE'S THE BEST!

00:07:59.238 --> 00:08:01.006
NOTHING CAN
STOP HIM NOW!

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:04.710
AH!

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.979
THIS CAN'T BE,
I'M DONE FOR!

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:08.814
BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS,

00:08:08.814 --> 00:08:12.017
I ACTIVATE THE DAMAGE
TRANSLATION TRAP!

00:08:12.017 --> 00:08:14.687
THIS CARD HALVES THE HARM
I TAKE FROM A CARD EFFECT!

00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:17.223
AH!

00:08:17.223 --> 00:08:20.626
AAAAH!

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:22.628
ARGGH!

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.398
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:26.398 --> 00:08:28.868
IMPRESSIVE STRING
OF ATTACKS, YUSEI!

00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:30.402
BUT LOOKS WHO'S
STILL STANDING!

00:08:31.904 --> 00:08:34.006
YA' KNOW,
I NEVER LIKED HIM.

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:35.641
HE MAY'VE MANAGED TO
SURVIVE THAT ATTACK,

00:08:35.641 --> 00:08:37.243
BUT HE'S FINISHED...

00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:38.911
HE'S GOT NO MONSTERS
ON HIS FIELD,

00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:40.880
AND YUSEI'S GOT
STARDUST DRAGON.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.815
AND I'D BET
A SALAMI SANDWICH

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:45.718
THAT FACEDOWN CARD OF
YUSEI'S IS SCRAP-IRON
SCARECROW...

00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:47.653
SO IF KALIN SUMMONS
A NEW MONSTER,

00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:49.288
YUSEI CAN NEGATE
THE ATTACK.

00:08:49.288 --> 00:08:51.290
YUSEI'S BIGGEST MISTAKE
WOULD BE THINKING

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.925
HE'S GOT THIS ONE
WRAPPED UP.

00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:54.160
EH?

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.029
THAT CARD KALIN ADDED
TO HIS HAND EARLIER...

00:08:57.029 --> 00:08:59.031
IT'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING POWERFUL.

00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:17.733
IF I CAN HOLD KALIN OFF
'TIL THE NEXT TURN...

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:19.401
MY SPEED COUNTER
WILL BE 8.

00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:22.237
AND I CAN ACTIVATE THE
FINAL ATTACK SPEED SPELL,

00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:24.440
WHICH'LL DOUBLE STARDUST
DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS...

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.041
THEN I'LL FINISH HIM OFF.

00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.876
I END MY TU-

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:29.411
SLOW DOWN,
I'M NOT DONE.

00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:31.814
SEE, MY DAMAGE
TRANSLATION'S
OTHER EFFECT

00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:33.682
ACTIVATES DURING
THE END PHASE...

00:09:33.682 --> 00:09:36.251
N'SINCE I TOOK DAMAGE
FROM CARD EFFECTS TWICE,

00:09:36.251 --> 00:09:39.087
I CAN SUMMON TWO GHOST
TOKENS TO MY FIELD.

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:41.990
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

00:09:44.393 --> 00:09:46.628
HA HA!

00:09:46.628 --> 00:09:48.297
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:50.466
THE IRONY IS DELICIOUS!

00:09:50.466 --> 00:09:54.203
YOU DID ALL THAT WORK
TO FORCE ME TO ADD A CARD
TO MY HAND.

00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:55.771
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK

00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.973
THAT THE CARD I MIGHT END UP
ADDING TO MY HAND

00:09:57.973 --> 00:09:59.308
WOULD BE MY MOST POWERFUL?!

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:00.542
WHAT IS IT?

00:10:00.542 --> 00:10:02.611
TIME FOR THE BIG FINALE!

00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.247
COME ON OUT, EVERYBODY!

00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:07.316
WHAT IS THIS?!

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:12.221
HUH!
KALIN, WHO ARE THEY?

00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.822
YA' SEE THAT, IT...

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.991
IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S PEOPLE
IN THE PURPLE MIST!

00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:18.060
Tank: WHERE'D
THEY COME FROM?

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.196
Nervin: YOUR GUESS IS
AS GOOD AS MINE, TANK.

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:23.265
MAYBE THERE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO WERE TAKEN IN

00:10:23.265 --> 00:10:25.334
BY THAT WEIRD GROUP
AND WENT UNDERGROUND...

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:26.635
HUH?
HUH?

00:10:26.635 --> 00:10:28.871
I HAD A FEELING
IT WAS YOU DARK SIGNERS

00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:30.205
WHO'VE BEEN
TAKING PEOPLE...

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:31.473
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO 'EM?

00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:33.408
IT'S MY TURN NOW...

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:36.979
BUT BECAUSE OF POWER BATON,
I CAN'T DRAW ANOTHER CARD.

00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:39.915
ANSWER ME, KALIN!

00:10:39.915 --> 00:10:41.717
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THESE PEOPLE!?

00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:44.586
HA HA. WHAT DO
YOU THINK, YUSEI?

00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:48.056
I AM GOING TO CHANNEL
THEIR SPIRITS TO THIS CARD.

00:10:48.056 --> 00:10:50.459
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT?!

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:55.063
THEIR COMBINED ENERGY IS
GOING TO GIVE THIS CARD
UNBELIEVABLE POWER!

00:10:55.063 --> 00:10:58.100
BY RELEASING THE TWO GHOST
TOKENS FROM MY FIELD...

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.137
I BANISH THE TAKEN TO THE
NETHERWORLD AS AN OFFERING
TO THE EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL...

00:11:02.137 --> 00:11:03.805

00:11:12.748 --> 00:11:14.116
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.954
WHERE DID ALL THESE
FLASHES COME FROM?

00:11:18.954 --> 00:11:21.323
THEIR ENERGY HAS
BEEN ASSIMILATED!

00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:25.127
AND NOW, CCAPAC APU
WILL DESCEND UPON THIS WORLD!

00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:56.992
AH!

00:11:58.994 --> 00:12:01.363
THAT... IS REALLY BIG.

00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:09.638
HA HA!

00:12:09.638 --> 00:12:13.308
OKAY, HOW COME GOODWIN
DIDN'T WARN ME ABOUT
THIS GUY!?

00:12:13.308 --> 00:12:15.444

GET READY TO JOIN THE REST
OF THE TAKEN IN THE SHADOWS
OF THE NETHERWORLD!

EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,
CCAPAC APU!

00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:26.555
POUND THIS PATHETIC SIGNER
INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:12:26.555 --> 00:12:27.556
OH!

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:32.794
HUH. ARGH!

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:34.763

00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:36.131

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.200
OH, IT DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING!

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.936
WELL, AT LEAST I GOT
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:12:40.936 --> 00:12:42.771
COME ON, YUSEI...

00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:44.539
DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
A LITTLE TRAP LIKE THAT

00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:46.642
CAN STAND UP AGAINST
THE POWER OF AN IMMORTAL?

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:51.346
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.848
I CAN'T STOP
THIS ATTACK.

00:12:56.145 --> 00:12:57.213
YUSEI!

00:12:57.213 --> 00:12:58.181

HANG ON, YUSEI!

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.372
WHY'D IT STOP GLOWING,
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:13:33.372 --> 00:13:35.708
DID SOMETHING BAD
JUST HAPPEN TO YUSEI?

00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:39.712
I'M NOT SURE, BUT...
I THINK HE'S BEEN HURT.

00:13:45.918 --> 00:13:47.720
YUSEI'S IN DANGER...

00:13:49.755 --> 00:13:55.094
LOOKS AS THOUGH THE DARK SIGNERS
ARE STRONGER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:58.397
UH! OH!

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:02.568
AND THE MOMENT
ALL HOPE IS LOST,

00:14:02.568 --> 00:14:04.703

JUST LOOK AT YOU!
YOU'RE SO PATHETIC.

YOU MAY HAVE MANAGED
TO SURVIVE THIS

BUT I'M AFRAID YOU
CAN'T FIGHT YOUR FATE...

YOU CAN'T STOP THE

OBLITERATED!

00:14:22.855 --> 00:14:25.925

MORE LIKE "SATELLITE'S

TO THE CITY RIGHT AWAY.

00:15:30.122 --> 00:15:31.624
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT!?

00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:34.093
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT WE LET

BUT RIGHT NOW,

THAT YOU CAN DO.

ALLEY TO GET TO MARTHA'S
HOUSE, DON'T WE?

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.845
THEN WE SHOULD MOVE
BEFORE IT GETS LATE

00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:54.346
AND THE THUGS
COME OUT TO PLAY.

00:15:54.346 --> 00:15:55.481

LEAVE THIS.

00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:04.923
WE CAN'T PUSH THAT THING
ALL THE WAY TO MARTHA'S,

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.859

TO RIPPER ROW...

00:16:08.627 --> 00:16:11.130

SOMEONE'LL STEAL IT

IN THIS DUEL RUNNER.

00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:25.878

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.581

AND GATHERING PARTS

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.596
I THINK WE...
GOT AWAY.

00:19:03.596 --> 00:19:05.531
HAVE I SAID
"I TOLD YOU SO" YET?

00:19:05.531 --> 00:19:06.832
FIVE TIMES.

00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:09.068
HEH HEH.

00:19:09.068 --> 00:19:11.237
YOU GOTTA PAY THE TOLL
IF YOU WANNA PASS.

00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:13.406
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

00:19:13.406 --> 00:19:15.408
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CARDS
TO GIVE 'EM...

00:19:15.408 --> 00:19:17.543
NO, BUT WE DO
HAVE CLOTHES...

00:19:17.543 --> 00:19:18.945

I NEED YOUR HELP, HURRY, WAKE

IT'S THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT, CROW.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.102
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

00:19:43.102 --> 00:19:44.704
NO, IT'S BAD,
IT'S REAL BAD!

00:19:44.704 --> 00:19:47.707
HUH? IS THAT YUSEI?

WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:53.179
HE'S SHIVERING.

TAKE A LITTLE BREAK...

00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:19.472
WE CAN'T STOP HERE,
YOU GUYS, IT'S NOT SAFE.

00:20:19.472 --> 00:20:23.442
YOU WANT YUSEI TO KNOW
THAT WE LOST HIS BIKE
'CAUSE YOU GUYS GOT TIRED?

00:20:23.442 --> 00:20:26.345
TANK, THINK ABOUT THAT TIME
WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH
JELLY BEAN WITHDRAWAL

00:20:26.345 --> 00:20:29.782
AND YUSEI RAN THROUGH
THE CROSSROADS IN THE RAIN
JUST TO GET YOU SOME.

00:20:29.782 --> 00:20:32.852
HE HAD A COLD AT THE TIME,
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HIM
FROM HELPING YOU OUT!

00:20:32.852 --> 00:20:34.120
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.621
NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT...

00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:38.724
THERE WAS THAT TIME I NEEDED
AN ENERGY CELL FOR A PROJECT

00:20:38.724 --> 00:20:41.827
AND YUSEI SCORED ONE
FOR ME BY TRADING ONE
OF HIS FAVORITE CARDS.

00:20:41.827 --> 00:20:43.329
YOU'RE RIGHT,
LITTLE MAN,

00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:45.064
YUSEI WOULD DO
ANYTHING TO HELP
ANY OF US,

00:20:45.064 --> 00:20:46.766
AND HE'D NEVER
COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:49.201
LET'S GO!
LET'S DO THIS FOR YUSEI!

00:20:49.201 --> 00:20:50.436

THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM...

00:20:52.038 --> 00:20:54.340
LOOK AT THE ROAD AHEAD OF US.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.008
IT'S A DEAD END!

00:20:56.008 --> 00:20:58.778

ARE YOU IN TROUBLE?

I'M AFRAID IF YOU
WANNA PASS...

00:21:07.053 --> 00:21:09.555
YOU'LL HAVE TO CUT THROUGH
THE ALLEY OVER THERE.

00:21:09.555 --> 00:21:12.758
OH!
UH... THANKS?

A LEFT UP HERE, AND...

THIS IS SECTOR SECURITY!

AND GIVE YOURSELVES UP.

TO SEE SECTOR SECURITY.

PATROL WAY OUT HERE.

HOW DOES IT LOOK,

HE'S GOT SOME SERIOUS BRUISING
ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF HIS ABDOMEN.

00:22:35.274 --> 00:22:37.042
IS HE GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT?
