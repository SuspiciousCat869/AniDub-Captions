00:17:56.297 --> 00:17:59.200
NOT SO FAST!

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.234
HUH?

00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:03.070
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:06.207
BLIZZARD LIZARD'S
SPECIAL ABILITY IS GOING ON.

00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:08.142
WHEN THIS CARD IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:12.046
YOU GET HIT FOR 300 POINTS
OF DIRECT DAMAGE.

00:18:12.046 --> 00:18:13.881
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:16.284
AKIZA USES A SIMILAR
POWER WHEN SHE DUELS.

00:18:16.284 --> 00:18:18.419
BUT THIS GUY'S
DIFFERENT SOMEHOW.

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:19.687
HUH?

00:18:21.856 --> 00:18:23.824
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:23.824 --> 00:18:26.027
DID MY ATTACK
CREATE REAL DAMAGE?

00:18:26.027 --> 00:18:28.729
IS THAT WHAT THIS
ENERGY RING IS ABOUT?

00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:30.197
IT MAKES
BATTLE DAMAGE REAL?

00:18:30.197 --> 00:18:32.366
[LAUGHING]

00:18:35.603 --> 00:18:37.405
OH, OK, CHUCKLES,
I GET IT,

00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:39.140
YOU'RE GONNA BE
LIKE THAT.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.809
IT'S MY TURN NOW.
I DRAW.

00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:45.079
FIRST, I'M ACTIVATING
THE CALL OF THE HAUNTED
TRAP CARD.

00:18:45.112 --> 00:18:48.082
THIS CARD LETS ME SELECT
ONE MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:18:48.115 --> 00:18:50.718
AND SUMMON IT
INTO ATTACK MODE!

00:18:50.718 --> 00:18:54.622
SO I'M BRINGING BACK
BLIZZARD LIZARD.

00:18:54.622 --> 00:18:56.090
WITH THAT DONE,

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.126
I ACTIVATE THE
ICE MIRROR SPELL CARD
FROM MY HAND.

00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:03.331
Computer: ICE MIRROR
IS A SPELL CARD

00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:06.767
THAT LETS YOU SELECT A WATER
ATTRIBUTE MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD

00:19:06.767 --> 00:19:10.671
AND THEN SUMMON THE SAME MONSTER
FROM YOUR DECK.

00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.406
SO WITH THE POWER
OF THIS CARD,

00:19:12.406 --> 00:19:14.408
I'M BRINGING OUT
ANOTHER BLIZZARD LIZARD

00:19:14.408 --> 00:19:16.977
TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:19:20.748 --> 00:19:23.017
AND NOW I'LL PLAY THIS.

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:25.019
ANOTHER
ICE MIRROR SPELL?!

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:27.588
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND WITH IT,

00:19:27.588 --> 00:19:30.591
I SUMMON OUT A THIRD
BLIZZARD LIZARD.

00:19:30.591 --> 00:19:33.060
DOESN'T THIS GUY KNOW
THAT 3'S A CROWD?

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.463
WELL, THEN, HOW ABOUT I
RELEASE TWO OF THEM

00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:39.166
TO MAKE SOME ROOM
FOR MY LEVEL 8 DARK TUNER
CATASTROGUE!

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.171
A DARK TUNER?

00:19:44.171 --> 00:19:45.706
YES!

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:47.842
NOW,
DARK TUNER CATASTROGUE,

00:19:47.842 --> 00:19:49.877
USE YOUR POWER
TO EXTINGUISH THE LIGHT

00:19:49.877 --> 00:19:53.280
BY ABSORBING THE ENERGY
OF BLIZZARD LIZARD.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.217
LET THE DARK SHADOWS RISE!

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.688
HEH HEH HEH!

00:20:00.688 --> 00:20:01.989
THE SHADOWS WIELD A POWER

00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:04.358
LIKE NOTHING
YOU'VE EVER SEEN!

00:20:15.603 --> 00:20:18.572
THE STARS JUST TURNED DARK.
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:21.041
THE LIGHT
IS BEING CONSUMED
BY THE SHADOWS.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.810
WHEREAS YOU COMBINE
YOUR MONSTERS

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.545
TO MAKE THEM
MORE POWERFUL,

00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:26.447
MY MONSTERS FEED OFF
ONE ANOTHER

00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:29.316
AND ABSORB EACH OTHER
TO CREATE NEGATIVE ENERGY.

00:20:29.316 --> 00:20:31.085
I THOUGHT
NEGATIVE ENERGY
WAS ONLY A THEORY.

00:20:31.118 --> 00:20:32.920
THINK AGAIN, YUSEI.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.456
NEGATIVE ENERGY
IS VERY REAL.

00:20:35.456 --> 00:20:38.159
THE MONSTER I'M SUMMONING
IS A NEGATIVE LEVEL 5!

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:41.529
HUH! NO WAY!

00:20:41.529 --> 00:20:42.930
WHEN THE SHADOWS
ARE DEVOURED

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.865
BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS,

00:20:44.865 --> 00:20:47.301
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS...

00:20:47.301 --> 00:20:49.703
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:20:49.703 --> 00:20:53.073
COME FORTH,
FROZEN FITZGERALD!

00:21:01.816 --> 00:21:03.317
[ROARING]

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:06.520
A DARK SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.222
HOW DO I BATTLE THAT?

00:21:10.257 --> 00:21:12.760
[GRUNTS]

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.063
[THINKING]
SOON, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL KNOW
WHAT GOODWIN'S TRYING TO HIDE.

00:21:16.096 --> 00:21:18.065
[LAUGHING]

00:21:18.098 --> 00:21:19.099
[THINKING]
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT

00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:20.634
HOW TO BEAT THIS
SHADOW DRONE,

00:21:20.634 --> 00:21:22.736
OR I'LL NEVER
FIND OUT THE TRUTH.
