FOR THIS MOMENT:

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.508
THE FOUR SIGNERS ALL TOGETHER!

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.978

Luna: IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL OF OUR SIGNS!

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.689
IT IS THE SYMBOL
THAT BINDS YOU ALL

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.592
AND DEFINES YOU AS SIGNERS:
PROTECTORS OF THE WORLD!

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:28.461
THE CRIMSON DRAGON SENSED
THE STRENGTH IN YOUR HEARTS

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.698
AND CHOSE THE FOUR OF YOU TO
TAKE ON THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

TO STOP THE ARMY OF SHADOWS
FROM AWAKENING,

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.080
THE SOULS OF THE PLANET
WILL FALL INTO DARKNESS...

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.717
THE TASK THAT'S BEFORE US JUST
MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER WIN.

WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:53.586
WE'VE LOST BEFORE
THE FIRST DRAW?!

THERE'S NO HOPE AT ALL.

ALL OF THEM TOGETHER.

I THINK YOU'RE TRYIN'
TO TRICK ME,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.102

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.921
IF YOU'RE SO CONVINCED
THAT I'M A DARK SIGNER...

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.689
WHY DON'T YOU PUSH ME
TO MY LIMITS

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.292
BY FORCING ME INTO A CORNER
WHERE I'LL HAVE TO RELY

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.394

FAKE FEATHER TRAP?!

00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:42.101
THIS CAN'T BE ACCURATE!

00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:43.803

00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:47.673

SUMMONING IT ORIGINALLY?

00:08:47.673 --> 00:08:51.077
UNLESS... THE INTEL'S
CORRECT AND HE DID

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:53.613

HIS RELOAD TRAP,

00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:00.820
HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIS
FAKE FEATHER DOWN SECOND.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.956
