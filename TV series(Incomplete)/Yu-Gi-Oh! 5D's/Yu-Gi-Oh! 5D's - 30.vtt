00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.184
HA!

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.253
THESE CARDS ARE JUST

WE'VE GOT REPORTS
OF A SUSPICIOUS PERSON

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:27.194
OUT BY THE IMPOUND LOT.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.196
LOOKS LIKE SOME
UNDERGROUND DUELER

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.898

KEEPIN' SWEET CARDS

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.614
LIKE THESE LOCKED UP IN HERE,
WHILE PLAYERS BACK HOME

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:49.683

Goodwin: HOW DO YOU LIKE
THE BRIDGE, YUSEI?

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.105
DID YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS
ONCE GOING TO CONNECT

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:19.740
THE SATELLITE
WITH NEW DOMINO CITY?

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.075
SO WHY WAS IT
NEVER FINISHED?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.311
HMM. I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.082
YOU SEE, IF THE CONSTRUCTION
OF THIS BRIDGE WAS
EVER COMPLETED,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.918
IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN
THE EVIL THAT LIVES DEEP
BENEATH THE SATELLITE

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.754
ACCESS TO MY PRECIOUS
NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.290
AND THE BATTLE THAT IS
ABOUT TO BEGIN MUST NEVER

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.425
REACH THESE SHORES.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.894
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE PEOPLE IN
THE SATELLITE?

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.563
THEY WILL BECOME
ENVELOPED IN
ETERNAL DARKNESS

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.465
UNLESS SOMEONE
CAN SAVE THEM.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.969
SO WHY AREN'T
YOU USING THE POWER
YOU POSSESS

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:50.804
TO GET THEM OUT
OF THERE?

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:52.372
I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.740
BUT WHY?

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.876
BECAUSE AS LONG AS
THE PEOPLE IN THE SATELLITE

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.911
REMAIN THERE,
THE DARKNESS WILL
STAY AS WELL.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.280
BUT WHY WOULD YOU
PUT THE PEOPLE

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:01.581
OF THE SATELLITE
AT RISK?

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.752
YUSEI, THE TIME HAS
COME FOR ME TO TELL
YOU THE TRUTH.

GONNA LOOK SWEET

THAN USUAL.

00:03:17.898 --> 00:03:18.899
HMM.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.534
BUT I DON'T THINK
THE AIR VENTS

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:21.501
ARE GONNA WORK THIS TIME.

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:24.237

FIRST UP:
SAKURETSU ARMOR!

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.742
THIS PIECE OF HARDWARE

00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:15.843

THREE: INTERCEPT!

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.653
AS SOON AS HE RELEASES
A MONSTER TO UPGRADE

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.389
TO SOMETHING BIGGER,
IT COMES OVER TO
MY SIDE OF THE FIELD!

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.425
SO NO MATTER WHAT MOVE
HE TRIES TO MAKE,

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.961
HE'LL NEVER OUTRUN
THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW!

00:06:36.364 --> 00:06:37.365

BIRDS ARE WORTHLESS;

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.450
IT'S TIME THIS CROW
SPREAD ITS WINGS.

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:47.034
Computer: WINGS ENGAGED!

00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:54.241
TAKE OFF!

00:10:00.114 --> 00:10:01.548
HE'S FLYIN'!
HE'S FLYIN'!

00:10:06.854 --> 00:10:08.188
WE NEED BACK-UP!
CALL THE CAPTAIN!

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:10.324
OH, SURE, PAL.

00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:12.526
AND YOU WANNA TELL'IM
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.761
THAT HE GOT AWAY?!

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:15.028
GO AHEAD!

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:16.330
GOOD POINT.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.332
LET'S JUST PRETEND
THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:19.466
WHAT?
EXACTLY.

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:22.503
[TYPING]

00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:26.507
[GROANING]

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:30.477
OH, MAN?

00:10:32.212 --> 00:10:33.213
WHERE EXACTLY AM I?

00:10:34.948 --> 00:10:35.983
WHAT HAPPENED
IN HERE, HUH?

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:38.185
I WAS HOPING YOU
COULD TELL ME, TRUDGE.

00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:41.688
I CAME TO FIND JACK,
AND THEN I FORGET.

00:10:42.923 --> 00:10:44.658
WELL, YOU "FOUND" JACK
ALRIGHT, JUST LOOK.

00:10:45.893 --> 00:10:46.894
AT WHAT? HUH?

00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:49.196
YOU WERE DUELING.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.301
THAT'S ME!

00:10:54.535 --> 00:10:55.502
YES, GENIUS.

00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:56.937
AND NOW JACK'S
GONE MISSING.

00:10:57.504 --> 00:10:59.373
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM
BEFORE SOMETHING
HAPPENS.

00:10:59.706 --> 00:11:02.142
WAIT! YOU CAN'T THINK
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HIM VANISHING!

00:11:03.977 --> 00:11:04.978
AND WHY WOULD I?

00:11:05.446 --> 00:11:07.047
COULD IT BE THAT YOU
TWO WERE DUELING

00:11:07.347 --> 00:11:09.082
IN AN ILLEGAL MATCH
THAT TURNED THIS
HOSPITAL

00:11:09.183 --> 00:11:10.184
INTO A WAR ZONE?!

00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:12.920
WELL, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY.

00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:19.259
Boy: TAG! YOU'RE IT!

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.861
Girl: OH, COME ON,
I'M ALWAYS IT!

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:22.830
GOTTA LEARN
TO RUN FASTER!

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:27.334
LOOK IT'S CROW!

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:28.402
HE'S BACK!

00:11:29.136 --> 00:11:30.637
WHA'D YOU BRING US?
WHA'D YOU BRING US?

00:11:30.637 --> 00:11:31.638
I WANNA SEE!

00:11:31.772 --> 00:11:33.207
FIRST, HAVE ALL
YOU KIDS BEEN GOOD?

00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:35.309
Kids: YEAH!

00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:36.643
WELL IN THAT CASE...
TA-DAA!

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:40.180
WOWWWW!
THANKS, CROW!

00:11:40.848 --> 00:11:41.849
THEY'RE GREAT!

00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:43.150
ARE THEY OURS?
LIKE FOR KEEPS?

00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:44.918
EV'RY KID NEEDS
A DUEL DECK!

00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:47.554
AND UNCLE CROW JUST
FOUND THESE LYING AROUND!

00:11:48.856 --> 00:11:50.123
JUST PROMISE THAT
YOU WON'T LET

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.926
SECTOR SECURITY SEE YOU
PLAYIN' WITH THESE CARDS.

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.530
CAUSE IF YOU DO, THEN
THEY MIGHT JUST COME
LOOKING FOR THIS FACE.

00:11:57.297 --> 00:11:59.032
BUT I PROMISE THAT ONE
DAY SECTOR SECURITY

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:00.400
WON'T BOTHER US NO MORE!

00:12:01.602 --> 00:12:02.569
Kids: YEAH!

00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:05.038
Computer:
WELCOME HOME, CROW.

00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:06.473
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEWS.

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:08.242
YUSEI FUDO WON
THE FORTUNE CUP.

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:10.377
HE DEFEATED JACK ATLAS.

00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:12.312
HE IS THE NEW CHAMPION.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.382
HMM. LOOKS LIKE ALL
OF THE RUMORS ARE TRUE THEN.

00:12:17.184 --> 00:12:21.121
HUH. NOW IF YUSEI COULD
MAKE IT TO THE CITY,
WHY COULDN'T I?

00:12:24.658 --> 00:12:26.059
YOU SAID YOU'D
TELL ME THE TRUTH?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.661
WHY DON'T WE
START WITH THIS?

00:12:28.362 --> 00:12:29.963
THAT IS THE MARK
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:12:30.464 --> 00:12:32.833
IT BELONGS TO THOSE
WHO PROTECT OUR WORLD
FROM THE DARKNESS.

00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:35.469
OH IS THAT ALL?

00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:37.104
THEN WHY DID IT
CHOOSE ME, HUH?!

00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:40.173
BECAUSE YOU ARE STRONG
AND SELFLESS, YUSEI,

00:12:41.074 --> 00:12:43.076
THE DRAGON KNEW YOU WOULD
NOT RUN FROM A CHALLENGE

00:12:43.443 --> 00:12:44.845
OR FROM THE DARKNESS
THAT IS COMING.

00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:46.947
AND THIS DARKNESS
IS DANGEROUS.

00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:49.082
IT WILL TAKE
ON MANY FORMS,

00:12:49.483 --> 00:12:51.084
IT MAY BE A STRANGER
OR A FRIEND,

00:12:51.418 --> 00:12:52.819
BUT YOU WILL KNOW
FOR THEY WILL HAVE

00:12:52.819 --> 00:12:53.820
THE MARK OF THE SHADOWS.

00:12:54.521 --> 00:12:55.522
"MARK
OF THE SHADOWS?!"

00:12:56.156 --> 00:12:57.424
YOU MUST MEAN
THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:12:57.524 --> 00:12:58.725
I DUELED ONE
OF THEIR DRONES!

00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:01.094
AND HE HAD A GLOWING
SPIDER ON HIS ARM!

00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:04.364
THEN THE FIRST BATTLE
OF THIS WAR HAS
ALREADY BEEN WON.

00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:07.367
JUST AS YOU WERE CHOSEN
TO PROTECT THE LIGHT,

00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:09.036
THEY CHOOSE TO
PROTECT THE DARKNESS.

00:13:09.803 --> 00:13:11.605
THEY WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO STOP YOU YUSEI.

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.674
"DARK SIGNERS?!"
"CHOSEN PROTECTORS?!"

00:13:14.508 --> 00:13:15.709
BUT WHEN DID
ALL THIS START!

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:17.644
PERHAPS WE SHOULD GO
BACK TO THE BEGINNING,

00:13:17.778 --> 00:13:19.379
5,000 YEARS AGO
WHEN THE WAR BEGAN.

00:13:20.847 --> 00:13:22.015
NOW WE'RE
GETTING SOMEWHERE.

00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:23.417
TELL ME.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.018
THERE WERE TWO
GREAT ARMIES...

00:13:25.552 --> 00:13:26.954
ONE OF SHADOW
AND ONE OF LIGHT.

00:13:27.588 --> 00:13:29.222
THEY BATTLED ACROSS
THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:31.224
NEARLY DESTROYING
THE WHOLE PLANET.

00:13:31.858 --> 00:13:34.061
THE ARMY OF LIGHT WASN'T
AN ARMY OF MEN AND STEEL,

00:13:35.062 --> 00:13:36.630
BUT OF DRAGONS,
FIVE POWERFUL CREATURES

00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:39.833
THAT HAD SWORN TO PROTECT
THE EARTH AT ALL COSTS.

00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:42.002
THEY FOUGHT
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS,

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:44.571
COMPRISED OF OTHER CREATURES,
UNKNOWN EXCEPT

00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:47.374
FOR THE SCARS
THEY LEFT ON THE SOIL.

00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:49.509
[MOANING]

00:13:53.447 --> 00:13:55.649
Goodwin: THE ARMIES HAD GATHERED
FOR ONE FINAL BATTLE.

00:13:56.817 --> 00:13:59.252
THE DRAGONS KNEW THEY
HAD NOT THE INDIVIDUAL
STRENGTH TO WIN,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.322
SO THEY COMBINED THEIR POWER
INTO A SINGLE FORCE:

00:14:03.223 --> 00:14:04.224
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:14:05.392 --> 00:14:07.227
THE CREATURES OF THE SHADOWS
FOUGHT FIERCELY,

00:14:08.128 --> 00:14:09.963
BUT THEY WERE NO MATCH
FOR THE COMBINED MIGHT

00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:11.999
OF THE DRAGONS
AND THEIR CRIMSON HERO.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.669
[ROARING]

00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:33.420
EVENTUALLY, THE ARMY
OF SHADOWS WAS DEFEATED,

00:14:34.254 --> 00:14:35.255
BUT NOT DESTROYED.

00:14:36.456 --> 00:14:37.924
INSTEAD, ITS ESSENCE
WAS TRAPPED DEEP

00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:40.027
BENEATH THE EARTH
TAKING WITH THEM ONE PRISONER,

00:14:40.727 --> 00:14:41.728
THE ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.331
[ROARS]

00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:46.667
[MOANS]

00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:57.077
THE CREATURES OF THE SHADOWS
WERE IMPRISONED

00:14:57.244 --> 00:14:58.979
UNDER THE NAZCA LINES,
BUT THE DRAGONS KNEW

00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:01.181
THAT ONE DAY
THEY MIGHT RETURN.

00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:03.817
AND SO THEY SACRIFICED
THEMSELVES,

00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:05.952
INSTILLING THE POWER
OF THE FIVE DRAGONS

00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.288
IN GENERATION AFTER
GENERATION OF HUMANS,

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:11.525
HOPING THAT MAYBE
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
COULD BE SUMMONED AGAIN.

00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:14.327
YOU HAVE THE SPIRIT
OF A DRAGON IN YOU, YUSEI,

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:16.530
JUST AS THE DARK
SIGNERS ARE POSSESSED

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.632
BY THE GROWING POWER
OF THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:15:19.099 --> 00:15:20.100
BUT HOW?
AND WHY NOW?!

00:15:21.768 --> 00:15:22.969
I... I THOUGHT THEY
WERE TRAPPED

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.304
UNDER THE GROUND
OR SOMETHING!

00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:25.472
IT'S BEEN
5,000 YEARS!

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:27.708
IT WAS SOMETHING WE
COULDN'T POSSIBLY PREDICT

00:15:27.841 --> 00:15:28.842
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:15:29.276 --> 00:15:31.111
TELL ME, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF THE ENER-D REACTOR?

00:15:31.812 --> 00:15:34.414
IT WAS BUILT TO ABSORB
THE POSITIVE ENERGY
CREATED THROUGH DUELING.

00:15:35.382 --> 00:15:36.583
BUT TO CREATE
A BETTER FUTURE,

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.652
WE HAD TO TAKE RISKS
IN THE PAST.

00:15:38.985 --> 00:15:40.253
YEARS AGO,
A PROTOTYPE WAS BUILT.

00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:42.622
IT WAS KEPT
DEEP UNDERGROUND,

00:15:42.923 --> 00:15:44.191
BELOW THE SLUMS
OF THE SATELLITE.

00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:46.760
Our GOAL WAS TO HARNESS
THE INCREDIBLE ENERGY

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:49.362
CREATED THROUGH
THE COMPETITION OF DUELING

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:51.031
AND USE IT AS
A POSITIVE FORCE.

00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:53.500
IMAGINE: POWERING ALL
OF NEW DOMINO CITY

00:15:54.568 --> 00:15:55.769
WITH JUST A PACK OF CARDS.

00:15:56.203 --> 00:15:57.771
WE WOULD BE
A BEACON FOR THE WORLD!

00:15:58.105 --> 00:15:59.172
BUT THEN
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:02.242
INSTEAD OF RELEASING
USEFUL, POSITIVE ENERGY,

00:16:03.677 --> 00:16:05.245
THE FIRST ENER-D REACTOR
HAD A MELTDOWN.

00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.049
NEGATIVE ENERGY ERUPTED
AND SPLIT NEW DOMINO
CITY IN TWO.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.718
EVERYTHING ABOVE
THE REACTOR WAS

00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:13.587
INFUSED WITH THIS
NEGATIVE ENERGY.

00:16:14.454 --> 00:16:16.123
IT BECAME A BARREN
WASTELAND OF DEPRESSION.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:18.191
IT BECAME THE SATELLITE.

00:16:19.092 --> 00:16:20.427
BUT THE TROUBLES
DIDN'T END THERE.

00:16:20.894 --> 00:16:22.562
THE BURST OF NEGATIVE ENERGY
WAS SO STRONG,

00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:24.531
THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH TREMBLED.

00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:26.800
AND SOMETHING DEEP
BENEATH IT WAS AWOKEN.

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:28.468
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS!

00:16:28.902 --> 00:16:30.470
EXACTLY. THEY FED
ON THE NEGATIVE ENERGY,

00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:32.472
GROWING IN POWER
UNTIL NOW,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.408
WHEN THEY WERE STRONG
ENOUGH TO CONTINUE
THEIR WAR.

00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:36.676
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:16:37.377 --> 00:16:39.179
I KNOW THIS MUST
ALL COME AS A SHOCK,

00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:42.048
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THAT MY GRIEF IS
EVEN WORSE THAN

00:16:42.415 --> 00:16:43.416
YOU COULD IMAGINE.

00:16:43.784 --> 00:16:45.585
AFTER ALL, I WAS IN
FAVOR OF ITS CREATION.

00:16:46.686 --> 00:16:47.888
I THOUGHT IT
WOULD HELP PEOPLE.

00:16:48.622 --> 00:16:50.423
BUT LOW AND BEHOLD
THE POWER OF THIS REACTOR

00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:52.993
HAS SPARKED A WAR
BETWEEN THE SIGNERS

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.294
AND THE FORCES
OF DARKNESS.

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:56.663
BUT I KNOW
HOW TO END IT.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.231
AND I'M GOING TO
NEED YOUR HELP.

00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:01.168
THAT DUEL TOURNAMENT
WASN'T HELD JUST FOR FUN.

00:17:01.868 --> 00:17:03.270
I HAD SOME SUSPICIONS
WHO THE SIGNERS

00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:05.372
MIGHT BE AND THAT
TOURNAMENT PROVED IT.

00:17:05.972 --> 00:17:07.541
NOW THAT I'VE
GATHERED YOU ALL TOGETHER,

00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:08.675
YOU CAN COMBINE
YOUR STRENGTH

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:10.343
AND DEFEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS...

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.445
THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO
OPEN THE EARTHEN PRISON

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:13.680
OF THE SHADOW ARMY.

00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:16.082
AND IF WE CAN'T
AND THEY RELEASE
THE "SHADOWS."

00:17:17.317 --> 00:17:19.186
IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN,
WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN

00:17:20.253 --> 00:17:21.254
A GLIMPSE OF OUR FATE

00:17:22.088 --> 00:17:23.123
DURING YOUR
DUEL WITH JACK.

00:17:23.356 --> 00:17:24.357
DO YOU REMEMBER?

00:17:26.259 --> 00:17:27.861
I CAN'T GET IT
OUT OF MY HEAD.

00:17:28.028 --> 00:17:29.229
THE SATELLITE
WAS DESTROYED.

00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:32.866
CAN'T WE EVACUATE?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.401
GET ALL THE PEOPLE
TO SAFETY?

00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:36.269
I GOT FRIENDS THAT ARE
STUCK THERE, GOODWIN!

00:17:36.736 --> 00:17:37.737
WHERE WOULD
YOU TAKE THEM?

00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:39.039
SATELLITE'S FIRST.

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:40.440
THEN NEW DOMINO
WOULD BE NEXT.

00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:42.342
THE PLANET WILL BE
REDUCED TO ASH,

00:17:43.043 --> 00:17:44.444
BUT THE FIRST BATTLE
MUST TAKE PLACE

00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:45.812
IN THE SATELLITE!

00:17:46.146 --> 00:17:47.347
THAT'S WHERE THIS
NEGATIVE ENERGY ORIGINATED,
