00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.373
HMM? WHO IS THAT?

00:08:45.373 --> 00:08:47.175
SHOW YOURSELF!

00:08:47.175 --> 00:08:48.977
Lazar:
QUITE A NICE PAD
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:50.879
VERY SPACIOUS.

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:53.348
THE MUST N' MOLD MOTIF
IS A BRAVE CHOICE.

00:08:53.348 --> 00:08:54.416
WHO'RE YOU!?

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:56.785
OH, SILLY ME,
I FORGOT MY MANNERS.

00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:59.054
MY NAME IS LAZAR,
MR. ATLAS.

00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:02.257
AND I AM HERE
TO SEE YOU ON BEHALF OF
DIRECTOR REX GOODWIN.

00:09:02.257 --> 00:09:04.259
IS THAT NAME SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING TO ME?

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:07.896
DIRECTOR GOODWIN
WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND YOU
AN INVITATION.

00:09:07.896 --> 00:09:09.164
HMM.

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:11.499
WE'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU
FROM AFAR, JACK,

00:09:11.499 --> 00:09:13.835
AND WE THINK YOU'RE
AN INCREDIBLE DUELIST.

00:09:13.835 --> 00:09:15.971
A TALENT LIKE YOURS
IS BEING WASTED

00:09:15.971 --> 00:09:17.405
OUT HERE
IN THE SATELLITE.

00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:19.908
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE A CHAMPION, JACK,

00:09:19.908 --> 00:09:21.376
TO SIT ON A REAL THRONE

00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:24.379
AS THE KING
OF THE TURBO DUELS.

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:28.917
HAVEN'T YOU ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE A CHAMPION,
MR. ATLAS?

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:30.886
FURTHERMORE,
HAVEN'T YOU WONDERED

00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:33.088
ABOUT THAT MARK
ON YOUR ARM?

00:09:33.088 --> 00:09:34.222
[GIGGLE]

00:09:34.222 --> 00:09:36.825
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

00:09:36.825 --> 00:09:38.760
TOMORROW EVENING
AT 7:00,

00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:40.629
THE MAINTENANCE
DEPARTMENT WILL
SHUT DOWN THE FLOW

00:09:40.629 --> 00:09:43.064
IN THE MAIN PIPELINE
FOR ONE HOUR.

00:09:43.064 --> 00:09:44.132
WE'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU

00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:47.135
ON THE OTHER SIDE,
MR. ATLAS.

00:09:47.135 --> 00:09:51.573
HOWEVER, WE DO REQUIRE
THAT YOU BRING
ONE THING WITH YOU.

00:09:51.573 --> 00:09:53.608
WE'VE HEARD THERE'S
ANOTHER DUELIST HERE,

00:09:53.608 --> 00:09:55.310
SOME UP AND COMING
HOT SHOT.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.678
HUH?

00:09:56.678 --> 00:09:57.979
WE DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT HIM

00:09:57.979 --> 00:10:00.982
OTHER THAN THAT HE USES
THE STARDUST DRAGON CARD.

00:10:00.982 --> 00:10:04.653
BUT SOME SAY
HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE THE BEST.

00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:07.956
YOU NEED TO FIND HIM
AND GET HIS
STARDUST DRAGON CARD.

00:10:07.956 --> 00:10:10.125
THINK OF IT
AS YOUR TICKET
TO A NEW LIFE.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:11.760
AND BELIEVE ME,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.296
DIRECTOR GOODWIN
CAN GIVE YOU
A NEW LIFE, JACK.

00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:16.564
NO ONE WILL KNOW YOU'RE
FROM THE SATELLITE.

00:10:16.564 --> 00:10:20.035
YOU'LL BE
A RESPECTED RESIDENT
OF NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:21.569
YOU'LL HAVE
SCREAMING FANS.

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:24.139
YOU'LL ATTEND
FANCY PARTIES.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:26.608
BUT, HEY, IF YOU
WANNA DWELL IN THE SLUMS

00:10:26.608 --> 00:10:29.144
AND LIVE WITH
THE COCKROACHES
ALL YOUR LIFE,

00:10:29.144 --> 00:10:30.712
YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO SO.

00:10:30.712 --> 00:10:33.615
THE CHOICE IS YOURS,
JACK.

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:35.317
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:55.971
HEY, JACK, UH,
WHY ARE WE
MEETING UP HERE?

00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:59.141
I THINK I'D LIKE TO
COME WATCH YUSEI'S
TEST RUN AFTER ALL.

00:10:59.141 --> 00:11:01.410
REALLY? WELL, THEN,
LET'S GET GOING.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.613
SURE, BUT I NEED HELP
WITH SOMETHING FIRST.

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:06.115
HEH! WHATEVER
YOU NEED, JACK,

00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:08.250
'CAUSE I STILL
OWE YA ONE FROM BEFORE!

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.653
YES, YOU DO...

00:11:14.056 --> 00:11:16.992
WHERE'S RALLY?

00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:18.727
HE'LL BE BUMMED
IF HE MISSES YUSEI
TEST OUT

00:11:18.727 --> 00:11:20.429
HIS NEW DUEL RUNNER.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.864
WHEN HE HEADED OUT
EARLIER,

00:11:21.864 --> 00:11:24.233
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT GOING TO
MEET UP WITH JACK.

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:25.434
HUH?

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.703
HE WENT TO SEE JACK?
WHAT A TRAITOR!

00:11:27.703 --> 00:11:29.338
COME ON.
HMM?

00:11:29.338 --> 00:11:31.407
RALLY CAN HANG OUT
WITH WHOEVER HE WANTS
T' HANG OUT WITH.

00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:33.842
YEAH, BUT WHAT
ABOUT LOYALTY?

00:11:33.842 --> 00:11:35.878
HUH?

00:11:35.878 --> 00:11:37.479
HUH? JACK?

00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:40.249
Jack: SOME EAST SIDE THUGS
JUST RAN OFF WITH RALLY.

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:41.383
THEY DID WHAT?

00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:44.353
YOU GUYS GO UPTOWN,
I'LL HEAD DOWNTOWN!

00:11:48.123 --> 00:11:50.059
LET'S SPLIT UP!

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:57.399
YUSEI, I FOUND HIM.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:11:59.368
COME DOWN TO THE WATERFRONT
RIGHT AWAY.

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:00.603
HUH?

00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:07.576
WHERE IS HE, JACK?

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.245
HE'S OUT THERE.

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:12.181
RALLY!

00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:13.582
THE TIDE'S
STILL GOING OUT.

00:12:13.582 --> 00:12:15.784
HE COULD BE SWEPT OUT
TO SEA.

00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:18.520
AND THEN THERE'S
THAT BIG STORM FRONT
APPROACHING.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.390
JACK, WHAT IS HE
DOING OUT THERE?

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.094
I GUESS THERE'S NO REASON
TO KEEP ON LYING TO YOU.

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.363
I PUT HIM OUT THERE.

00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:30.733
WHATEVER YOU NEED,
JACK, 'CAUSE I STILL OWE
YA ONE FROM BEFORE.

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:32.568
YES, YOU DO...

00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:38.507
AND NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO PAY ME BACK TENFOLD!

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.914
BUT RALLY'S YOUR FRIEND.

00:12:45.914 --> 00:12:47.549
KNOW WHAT PEOPLE
ARE SAYING?

00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:49.852
THAT YOU GOT
WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE THE BEST.

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.888
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
DON'T WE, YUSEI?

00:12:52.888 --> 00:12:54.323
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:56.625
YOU CAN EITHER DUEL ME
AND PROVE YOURSELF,

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:59.395
OR YOU CAN SWIM OUT
THERE N' SAVE RALLY.

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:00.796
WHAT'LL IT BE?

[WHIMPERING]

00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:05.334
WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU, PROVING THAT
YOU'RE A TRUE DUELIST?

00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:06.835
OR ARE YOU WILLING
TO PUT DUELING ASIDE

00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:09.071
TO HELP
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND?

00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:10.072

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:12.207
WHAT ARE YOU MADE OF?

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:14.543
UNH!

00:13:19.114 --> 00:13:20.516
[THINKING]
PATHETIC.

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:24.186
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE
STARDUST DRAGON.

00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:30.192
TIME FOR THAT TEST RUN.

00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:36.899
OH. AAH!

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.301

[THINKING]
SO LONG, SATELLITE.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:56.919
MAN, THIS IS
ALL MY FAULT.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:59.922
I'M SO SORRY.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.524
Jack: GOODWIN COULD NEVER
HAVE MADE YOU THE SAME OFFER

00:14:02.524 --> 00:14:05.260
BECAUSE YOU WOULD'VE NEVER
LEFT YOUR FRIENDS BEHIND.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.696
NOT FOR "FAME AND FORTUNE,"
ANYWAY.

00:14:07.696 --> 00:14:09.865
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:11.967
AND BY TRICKING ME
INTO TAKING YOUR CARD,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.837
HE GAVE YOU A REASON
TO COME AFTER ME.

00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:19.174
AND I THINK THAT BRINGS US
ALL UP TO SPEED, MORE OR LESS.

00:14:19.174 --> 00:14:22.177
I HAVE A DEMAND TO MAKE.

00:14:22.177 --> 00:14:25.114
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.
HE'S HERE, RIGHT?

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.784
LET HIS FRIENDS GO.
HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE COERCED.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:31.086
I WANT THIS DUEL
TO BE LEGIT.

00:14:31.086 --> 00:14:33.922
NO THREATS, NO GIMMICKS,
JUST US.

00:14:33.922 --> 00:14:36.792
IF THAT IS WHAT
MY CHAMPION WANTS,

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.761
THEN SO BE IT.

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:39.895
[CLINK]

00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:40.996
HUH?
HUH?

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:42.064

00:14:43.432 --> 00:14:46.335
NO WAY! IT'S OPEN!

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:47.703

00:14:56.712 --> 00:14:57.913
HEY, LOOK.

00:14:57.913 --> 00:15:00.149
THE FINAL SHOWDOWN
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.718
SATELLITE'S VERY OWN YUSEI FUDO

00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:05.287
HAS WON THE CHANCE
TO TAKE ON JACK ATLAS!

00:15:05.287 --> 00:15:06.989
YUSEI IS DUELING JACK?

00:15:07.022 --> 00:15:08.323
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:15:08.323 --> 00:15:10.592
HEY, LOOK.
LOOK AT HIS FACE!

00:15:10.592 --> 00:15:12.127

THEY MARKED HIM!

GUESS YOU MISS A LOT
WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED UP.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.668
THERE HE IS.

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.304
I WONDER IF GOODWIN
TOLD HIM WHAT HE
WANTED TO KNOW.

00:15:24.273 --> 00:15:26.375
THEY'RE OK.

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:27.576
ARE YOU HAPPY?

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:28.577
YOU FINALLY
HAVE YOUR CHANCE

00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:30.979
TO SETTLE THE SCORE
WITH ME.

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:33.482
I GUESS SO.

00:15:33.482 --> 00:15:35.384
YOU KNOW,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:36.852
BIG SET-UP OR NOT,

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:40.222
I STILL THINK THAT
YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLE
DUELIST, JACK.

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:42.057
OF COURSE I AM!

00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:49.698
[THINKING] SO YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA TRY TO SUMMON
THE CRIMSON DRAGON?

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:52.367
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

00:15:57.439 --> 00:15:58.507
THIS IS IT.

00:15:58.507 --> 00:15:59.908
I'M FINALLY
GOING TO SHOW YOU

00:15:59.908 --> 00:16:00.976
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:02.544
TO BE THE BEST,
YUSEI,

00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.046
YOU NEVER HAVE.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.515
ARE YOU SURE
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS
RIGHT NOW, JACK?

00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:09.151
THERE'S STILL A LOT
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE
CRIMSON DRAGON THING.

00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:11.520
HA HA! THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
YUSEI,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.888
YOU HAVE NO GUTS!

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:16.658
DON'T YOU WANT TO REVEAL
THE FIFTH SIGNER?

00:16:16.658 --> 00:16:18.126
[THINKING]
THE FIFTH SIGNER?

00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:19.361
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:21.997
YANAGI SAID THERE WERE
5 MARKS OF THE DRAGON.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.234
SO THERE'S ME, LUNA,
JACK, AND AKIZA.

00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:26.668
AND IF JACK'S RIGHT...

00:16:26.668 --> 00:16:28.136
THEN THAT MEANS
THERE'S GOTTA BE

00:16:28.136 --> 00:16:30.205
ONE MORE SIGNER
IN THE ARENA.

00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:32.207
BUT WHO IS IT?

00:16:44.461 --> 00:16:49.266
ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO ACTIVATE
THE SPEED WORLD FIELD SPELL!

00:16:54.371 --> 00:16:55.539
THIS IS THE MOMENT.

00:16:55.539 --> 00:16:57.774
WILL JACK ATLAS
CONTINUE TO REIGN

00:16:57.774 --> 00:16:59.409
AS THE KING OF TURBO DUELS?

00:16:59.409 --> 00:17:02.613
OR WILL HE BE DETHRONED
BY SATELLITE'S SHOOTING STAR?

00:17:02.613 --> 00:17:04.748
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT!

00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:08.452

00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:10.020
ADMIT IT, YUSEI.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.688
THE ROAR OF THE CROWD
IS MORE APPEALING

00:17:11.688 --> 00:17:13.290
THAN THE SCAMPER
OF THE RATS.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.125
LET'S JUST DUEL.

00:17:15.125 --> 00:17:18.362
I'M SUMMONING OUT
MY SHIELD WING
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:17:21.932 --> 00:17:23.967
NEXT I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN

00:17:23.967 --> 00:17:25.135
AND END MY TURN.

00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:27.838
IN THAT CASE,

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:31.108
I SUMMON TWIN-SWORD
MARAUDER IN ATTACK MODE!

00:17:34.978 --> 00:17:37.581
YOU MAY HAVE JUST
SCRAPPED YOUR WAY
TO THE TITLE MATCH,

00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:39.483
BUT THOSE OTHER DUELISTS
WERE JUST AMATEURS

00:17:39.483 --> 00:17:41.018
COMPARED TO ME.

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.853
NOW ALLOW
MY TWIN SWORD MARAUDER

00:17:42.853 --> 00:17:46.490
TO GIVE YOU
A PROPER WELCOME TO
THE BIG LEAGUES, YUSEI!

00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:49.726
UNH!

00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:51.428
YOU HAVEN'T GROWN A BIT
AS A DUELIST

00:17:51.428 --> 00:17:53.897
SINCE THE DAYS OF
RIDING AROUND IN THE SEWERS.

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:57.868
I CAN STILL ANTICIPATE
YOUR GAME AND STAY
TWO STEPS AHEAD OF YOU.

00:17:57.868 --> 00:17:59.570
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT SHIELD WING

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.204
CAN'T BE DESTROYED
IN ONE ATTACK,

00:18:01.204 --> 00:18:02.839
IT HAS TO BE
DEFEATED TWICE.

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:04.408
I DO KNOW THAT!

00:18:04.408 --> 00:18:05.676
AND WHEN
TWIN-SWORD MARAUDER

00:18:05.676 --> 00:18:07.578
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:09.046
IT CAN ATTACK AGAIN!

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.347
HUH!

00:18:10.347 --> 00:18:11.648
I SAID THAT I WAS TWO STEPS
AHEAD OF YOU, YUSEI,

00:18:11.648 --> 00:18:13.884
NOT JUST ONE.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:16.520
GO!
DOUBLE MARAUDER MAYHEM!

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:19.623
[GRUNT]

00:18:19.623 --> 00:18:21.291
AND TO END
MY FIRST TURN,

00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:23.727
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:24.895
[THINKING]
I ALREADY HAVE IN MY HAND

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.030
THE CARD THAT WILL
LEAD ME TO VICTORY

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.633
AND SETTLE THIS MATTER
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:31.802
YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME,
YUSEI!

00:18:34.638 --> 00:18:36.607
WE'LL SEE, JACK!

00:18:36.607 --> 00:18:37.941
[THINKING]
METEOR STREAM.

00:18:37.941 --> 00:18:39.476
JACK MIGHT BE
EXPECTING THIS

00:18:39.476 --> 00:18:41.411
SINCE I BEAT HIM
WITH IT BEFORE,

00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:43.947
SO I BETTER HOLD OFF
ON USING IT FOR NOW.

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:47.250
FROM MY HAND,
I SUMMON JUNK SYNCHRON.

00:18:48.251 --> 00:18:49.953
HMM!

00:18:49.987 --> 00:18:53.090
AND NOW I'M GOING TO
TUNE MY JUNK SYNCHRON
WITH MY SHIELD WING

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.326
IN ORDER TO
SYNCHRO SUMMON
JUNK WARRIOR!

00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:06.570
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:20.050
Computer: JUNK WARRIOR
IS a LEVEL 5 DARK ATTRIBUTE
WARRIOR TYPE SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.753
WITH 2,300 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1,300 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:19:22.753 --> 00:19:24.755
NOW TAKE OUT
THAT MARAUDER!

00:19:28.158 --> 00:19:29.960
UGH.

00:19:29.993 --> 00:19:34.197
NEXT,
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD:
SYNCHRO BLAST!

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:38.535
NOW,
WHEN MY WARRIOR ATTACKS,

00:19:38.535 --> 00:19:42.406
SYNCHRO BLAST
CAN SLAM YOU WITH
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:19:42.406 --> 00:19:44.508
NOW YOU'RE DUELING, YUSEI,

00:19:44.508 --> 00:19:46.176
BUT YOU WON'T BE FOR LONG!

00:19:47.944 --> 00:19:50.981
BECAUSE FROM MY HAND,
I SUMMON DARK TINKER!

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:53.917
[SHRIEKING]

00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:57.954
THEN I ACTIVATE
THE POWERFUL REBIRTH
TRAP CARD!

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.489
AND WITH THIS CARD,

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:03.393
I CAN RE-SUMMON
TWIN-SWORD MARAUDER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:20:03.393 --> 00:20:04.561
ALL RIGHT!

00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:06.163
DARK TINKER
IS ONLY LEVEL 3.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:08.932
AND THAT SWORD MARAUDER
IS A LEVEL 4.

00:20:08.932 --> 00:20:10.600
SO HE HASN'T GOT
THE POWER
THAT HE NEEDS

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.602
TO SUMMON
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:14.638
THIS IS
YOUR CHANCE, YUSEI!

00:20:14.638 --> 00:20:17.808
NOW THE MONSTER
RESURRECTED
BY POWERFUL REBIRTH

00:20:17.808 --> 00:20:20.043
GAINS 100 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS,

00:20:20.043 --> 00:20:22.879
AND ITS LEVEL
INCREASES BY 1.

00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:23.880
WHAT?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.482
HUH?

00:20:25.482 --> 00:20:27.851
YUSEI, I'M THE BEST
TURBO DUELIST

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.387
NEW DOMINO CITY
HAS EVER SEEN,

00:20:30.387 --> 00:20:31.922
AND THAT MOVE
I JUST MADE

00:20:31.922 --> 00:20:34.725
WAS ONE MORE EXAMPLE
OF WHY I'M THE CHAMP.

00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:35.859
AND NOW I'M GOING
TO SHOW YOU

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:37.728
WHY I'M GOING
TO REMAIN THE CHAMP...

00:20:37.728 --> 00:20:41.631
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:20:47.404 --> 00:20:49.439
[GASPING]
[GASPING]

00:20:49.439 --> 00:20:51.575
MAN, HE'S NOT
WASTING ANY TIME.

00:20:53.443 --> 00:20:54.678
[THINKING]
BACK IN THE SATELLITE,

00:20:54.678 --> 00:20:57.614
I KNEW THAT IN ORDER
TO REALIZE MY FULL POTENTIAL

00:20:57.614 --> 00:20:59.783
AND TO CLIMB UP
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF THE WORLD,

00:20:59.783 --> 00:21:01.852
I HAD TO THROW AWAY
EVERYTHING.

00:21:01.852 --> 00:21:05.155
I HAD TO TURN MY BACK
ON THE SATELLITE,
ON MY FRIENDS.

00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:07.958
NOTHING WAS
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME
THAN BEING THE BEST.

00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:09.326
BUT NOW HERE YOU COME,

00:21:09.326 --> 00:21:11.394
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO TAKE ME DOWN?

00:21:11.394 --> 00:21:12.896
YOU'RE NOT A REAL DUELIST.

00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:14.898
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
TO SACRIFICE ANYTHING.

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:17.033
YOU ALWAYS
PUT DUELING SECOND.

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:20.303
WELL, I'M FINALLY
GOING TO PUT YOU
IN YOUR PLACE!
