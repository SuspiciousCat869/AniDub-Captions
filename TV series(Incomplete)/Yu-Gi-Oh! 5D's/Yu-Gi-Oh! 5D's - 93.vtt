THAT MY LIFE WAS
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

FATHER LOST EVERYTHING.

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.709
THAT I WAS FORCED
TO RUN FOR MY LIFE.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.979
IT WAS BECAUSE OF ONE CARD
THAT EVERYTHING WAS RUINED.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.847

THROUGH THAT SAME ONE CARD

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.783
