BEING YOUR PUPPET!

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:46.613
CROW HOLD UP...

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.316
YOU CAN'T JUST TURN
YOUR BACK ON YOUR BUDDIES!

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.617
C'MON CROW!

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.920
THE ENFORCERS ARE
ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT!

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.588
HUH.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.223
JACK?! CROW?!

00:10:56.223 --> 00:10:57.791
STOP FOOLING AROUND!

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.460
[EXHALES] YUSEI!

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.228
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LEAVE ME TOO ARE YOU?

00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.629
I MEAN WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:07.301
Yusei, voice-over:
WHEN CROW AND JACK LEFT KALIN

00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:09.636
I KNEW THEY WERE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.872
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE IT IN ME
TO ABANDON HIM.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:14.708
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE ALONE...

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.044
AND NO ONE EVER
DESERVES THAT PAIN...

00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.313
HURRY UP AND MAKE
YOUR MOVE, TRAITOR!

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:21.682
I'M SUMMONING...
MAX WARRIOR!

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.288
AND WITH THE POWER
OF MY WARRIOR...

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:29.957
YOUR BEAST'S A GONER!

00:11:32.326 --> 00:11:34.495
[THINKING] I KNOW YOU THINK
I'M A TRAITOR KALIN,

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:37.064
BUT I'M GONNA RISK EVERYTHING
TO PROVE YOU WRONG!

00:11:51.686 --> 00:11:52.687
[THINKING] I KNOW DEEP DOWN

00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:53.888
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
THROUGH TO KALIN

00:11:53.888 --> 00:11:55.723
IS TO COME AT HIM
WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.

00:11:56.858 --> 00:11:58.860
MAX WARRIOR ATTACK!

00:12:00.361 --> 00:12:02.063
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:03.798
YOUR WARRIOR'S
NOT STRONG ENOUGH

00:12:03.798 --> 00:12:07.602
TO OVERPOWER THE DEFENSE OF
MY INFERNITY NECROMANCER.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.805
BUT IT WILL BE
ONCE I ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:12:10.805 --> 00:12:12.740
YOU SEE WHEN
THIS GUY ATTACKS,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.508
IT GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.011
GO SWIFT RUSH!

00:12:20.982 --> 00:12:22.250
[GRUNTING]

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.018
AND NOW, UNTIL
MY NEXT TURN,

00:12:24.018 --> 00:12:26.020
MY WARRIOR LOSES
HALF OF ITS ORIGINAL

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.455
ATTACK AND DEFENSE
POINTS

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.890
AS WELL AS
HALF ITS LEVEL.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.129
[THINKING] YOU MIGHT THINK
THAT'S A LOT TO SACRIFICE KALIN,

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.365
BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO WHAT I RISKED

00:12:37.365 --> 00:12:40.101
WHEN I STAYED BY YOUR SIDE
AFTER JACK AND CROW LEFT...

00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:44.305
Yusei: HEY KALIN,
CHECK IT OUT.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.147
IS THAT... A DUEL RUNNER?

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:54.348
SURE IS.

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:56.083
SECTOR SECURITY THINKS
THEY'RE UNSTOPPABLE

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:57.985
BECAUSE OF IT.

00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:00.788
ALRIGHT MEN, IT'S TIME
WE SHOW THESE DUEL GANGS

00:13:00.788 --> 00:13:02.456
WHAT THESE RUNNERS CAN DO...

00:13:02.456 --> 00:13:04.759
NOW LET'S ROLL OUT
AND DEAL SOME JUSTICE!

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.860
Officers: YES SIR!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.602
THERE'S NO POINT
IN RUNNING.

00:13:14.602 --> 00:13:16.437
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE
THE POWER AND SPEED

00:13:16.437 --> 00:13:17.939
OF THIS NEW RUNNER.

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:18.973
FINE THEN!

00:13:18.973 --> 00:13:20.808
I WAS GETTING TIRED ANYWAY!

00:13:20.808 --> 00:13:22.877
I SUMMON SKULL KNIGHT
NUMBER 2.

00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:24.445
YOU'LL REGRET THAT.

00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:26.681
I SUMMON ASSAULT DOG
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:31.986
AHHH! I SURRENDER!

00:13:31.986 --> 00:13:33.054
YOU WIN!

00:13:34.922 --> 00:13:37.792
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT
TO TAKE ON SECTOR SECURITY?

00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:38.926
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:40.561
THE ENFORCERS
FIRST CAME TOGETHER

00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:42.697
TO RID THE SATELLITE
OF DUEL GANGS.

00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.265
AND WHAT WOULD BE
MORE FITTING

00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:46.067
THAN FOR THE ENFORCERS'
LAST DUEL

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:50.371
TO BE AGAINST THE ULTIMATE
DUEL GANG... SECTOR SECURITY.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:53.574
BY DEFEATING THEM, OUR HOME
WOULD TRULY BE OURS AGAIN.

00:13:53.574 --> 00:13:55.276
NOW GO ROUND UP
JACK AND CROW!

00:13:55.276 --> 00:13:57.345
IT'S TIME FOR
THE ENFORCERS TO REUNITE.

00:13:57.345 --> 00:13:58.879
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO YOURSELF?

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:00.948
WE'LL ALL END UP
IN THE FACILITY!

00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:04.452
WELL LIVING LIKE THIS IS
ALREADY A PRISON SENTENCE.

00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:05.586
KALIN!

00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:13.294
I'M SORRY... BUT I CAN'T
BE A PART OF THIS PLAN.

00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:15.463
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
CLEARLY ANYMORE.

00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:16.664
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
DO THIS,

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:18.499
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT
ON YOUR OWN.

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:19.800
WAIT, YUSEI!

00:14:22.603 --> 00:14:24.805
[THINKING] I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING KALIN.

00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:25.940
I SWEAR IT.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.775
I THOUGHT IF I LEFT
YOU WOULD NEVER GO AFTER

00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:29.744
SECTOR SECURITY ON YOUR OWN.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.445
BUT I SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN BETTER...

00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:33.247
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
ONCE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.982
THERE WAS NO CHANGING IT.

00:14:34.982 --> 00:14:37.084
IT WAS YOU AGAINST
SECTOR SECURITY,

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:39.053
AND THE WAR WOULDN'T END
UNTIL ONE OF YOU

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:40.621
WAS FORCED TO SURRENDER.

00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:43.591
ONCE I LEARNED THAT
CONFISCATED DUEL DISKS

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.027
PLANTED WITH ELECTRONIC
PULSE CHARGES

00:14:46.027 --> 00:14:49.430
WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WIPING OUT
SECTOR SECURITY'S MAIN FRAME...

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.432
I REALIZED THE FIRST MOVE
HAD BEEN MADE

00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:53.234
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
THAT I SHOULD HAVE STAYED

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:55.036
AND TRIED TO REASON WITH YOU...

00:14:55.036 --> 00:14:56.604
INFORMATION IS POWER!

00:14:57.972 --> 00:15:00.107
[LAUGHS]

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.475
AND WITHOUT IT,
YOU'RE NOTHING!

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:06.614
[LAUGHS]

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.482
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN COPPER!

00:15:08.482 --> 00:15:10.718
TIME TO SEE WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF!

00:15:10.718 --> 00:15:13.087
Crow: I SUMMON THIS FELLA!

00:15:13.087 --> 00:15:14.522
HEY CROW!
HUH?

00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:16.357
YUSEI SENT ME
TO GET YOU.

00:15:16.357 --> 00:15:19.760
IT SEEMS KALIN ATTACKED
SECTOR SECURITY'S HEADQUARTERS!

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.062
HE DID WHAT?

00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:29.637
WE GOT TROUBLE!

00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:35.276
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

00:15:39.914 --> 00:15:41.916
[BREATHING HEAVILY]

00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:43.050
YUSEI!

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.085
KALIN!

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:49.924
Officer: WE'VE GOT YOU
SURROUNDED SATELLITE!

00:15:49.924 --> 00:15:51.392
NOW COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS UP.

00:15:55.229 --> 00:15:56.263
READY?!

00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:03.704
LOOKS LIKE OUR
FRIEND INSIDE...
HAS SOME COMPANY.

00:16:16.617 --> 00:16:20.321
[THINKING] I HOPE
THEY'RE READY FOR A FIGHT,
'CAUSE I SURE AM!

00:16:29.263 --> 00:16:32.299
[LAUGHS]
I KNEW IT!

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:34.235
I JUST KNEW YOU
WOULDN'T MISS THIS.

00:16:34.235 --> 00:16:37.738
THE ENFORCERS ARE BACK
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

00:16:37.738 --> 00:16:39.974
LISTEN KALIN, WE'RE NOT
HERE TO FIGHT.

00:16:39.974 --> 00:16:41.575
WE'RE HERE TO TRY
AND END THIS.

00:16:41.575 --> 00:16:43.410
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR
THIS TIME.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.480
[LAUGHS]
I HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH...

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.617
NOW LISTEN UP, THIS IS
THE MOMENT WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.453
AFTER THIS DUEL,
SATELLITE WILL BE OURS.

00:16:52.453 --> 00:16:54.054
YOU HEAR THAT SECTOR SECURITY!

00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:56.157
THE ENFORCERS ARE GONNA
RUN YOU OUTTA HERE.

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:00.294
I CAN END THIS...

00:17:01.762 --> 00:17:03.397
[THINKING] AND I REALLY THOUGHT
I COULD.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.033
I WAS NAIVE AND WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

00:17:06.033 --> 00:17:08.836
I LET YOU DOWN... BUT
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON

00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:10.771
AND I WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:13.507
IF I COULD GO BACK
AND DO IT ALL OVER I WOULD.

00:17:13.507 --> 00:17:16.610
JUST LIKE YOU RISKED EVERYTHING
FOR ME THAT DAY...

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.079
YUSEI, WE'RE BROS...

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.849
I'M NOW HERE TO RISK
EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.249
Trudge: YUSEI'S GOT
THE UPPER HAND...

00:17:39.249 --> 00:17:40.617
[THINKING] ...BUT
FOR HOW LONG...

00:17:43.087 --> 00:17:46.523
Kalin: I PLACE
3 CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:48.292
THEN IT'S MY MOVE!

00:17:48.292 --> 00:17:50.761
FIRST I'LL LAY DOWN
A FACEDOWN

00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:54.264
AND THEN I'LL TRIGGER
THE TRAP LIMIT IMPULSE!

00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:57.234
NOW BY SENDING TWO CARDS
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:17:57.234 --> 00:18:00.537
I CAN SUMMON
TWO SOUL TOKENS!

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:02.539
AND THEN BY RELEASING
THESE TWO TOKENS

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:05.676
I CAN ADVANCE SUMMON
DARK TUNER NIGHTMARE HAND!

00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:15.386
Duel runner computer:
WHEN DARK TUNER NIGHTMARE HAND
IS SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:18:15.386 --> 00:18:18.288
YOU CAN SUMMON ONE LEVEL TWO
MONSTER FROM YOUR HAND.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.626
KALIN MUST BE GOING
FOR HIS HANDLESS COMBO!

00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:25.028
AND WITH ONE CARD LEFT
HE'S ALMOST GOT IT.

00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:27.398
SORRY OLD FRIEND
BUT BY ACTIVATING

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:29.233
MY DARK TUNER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.435
THERE IS
NO MORE "ALMOST"...

00:18:33.437 --> 00:18:36.407
I SUMMON INFERNITY DWARF
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:43.580
OH NO, HIS HAND'S EMPTY...

00:18:45.849 --> 00:18:48.519
Kalin: NOW IT'S TIME
FOR MY HANDLESS COMBO
TO TAKE EFFECT.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:51.288
I TUNE MY LEVEL 10
DARK TUNER NIGHTMARE HAND

00:18:51.288 --> 00:18:53.457
WITH MY LEVEL 2
INFERNITY DWARF

00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:58.529
IN ORDER TO DARK SYNCHRO SUMMON
ONE HUNDRED EYED-DRAGON!

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.665
WHEN THE SHADOWS ARE DEVOURED
BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS,

00:19:01.665 --> 00:19:03.600
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS...

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.968
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.851
[THINKING] NOT THAT...

00:19:25.389 --> 00:19:27.891
AREN'T YOU GLAD
TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

00:19:27.891 --> 00:19:31.562
I KNOW I AM ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOUR MAX WARRIOR'S SO WEAK.

00:19:31.562 --> 00:19:33.330
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M
GOING TO GET MY REVENGE

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.732
SOONER THAN I ANTICIPATED.

00:19:35.732 --> 00:19:37.701
GO INFERNITY SIGHT STREAM!

00:19:41.538 --> 00:19:43.674
[GROANING]

00:19:45.809 --> 00:19:48.712
THAT ATTACK JUST
PUT KALIN BACK IN
THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

00:19:48.712 --> 00:19:50.881
YUSEI BETTER
GET A PLAN AND FAST!

00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:52.683
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:19:52.683 --> 00:19:56.053
TRUST ME WHEN I SAY
THE WORST IS YET TO COME.

00:19:56.053 --> 00:19:58.188
WELL THEN I BETTER
ACT FAST.

00:19:58.188 --> 00:20:00.357
I PLAY THE TRAP
REVIVAL TICKET!

00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:02.693
NOW FOR EVERY MONSTER
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:20:02.693 --> 00:20:04.895
IF I DESTROY ONE CARD
ON MY FIELD

00:20:04.895 --> 00:20:07.264
I CAN POWER UP
MY LIFE POINTS.

00:20:07.264 --> 00:20:09.199
AND THEN
I CAN BRING BACK
ALL MY MONSTERS

00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:10.667
THAT WERE DESTROYED
IN BATTLE.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:13.170
SO SAY HELLO AGAIN
TO MAX WARRIOR!

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.174
YOU CAN'T!

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.076
BUT I CAN KALIN
AND BECAUSE

00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:22.679
I DESTROYED MY TRAP CARD
LIMITER BREAKER EARLIER,

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.281
I'M NOW GONNA
USE ITS EFFECT

00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:26.383
TO SUMMON SPEED WARRIOR
TO MY FIELD.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.388
YUSEI'S THE BEST!

00:20:31.388 --> 00:20:34.057
I HATE TO ADMIT IT LEO,
BUT YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

00:20:34.057 --> 00:20:36.560
YOU ALWAYS WERE
THE CLEVER ONE WEREN'T YOU?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.228
BUT HOW DO YOU
PLAN ON OVERPOWERING

00:20:38.228 --> 00:20:39.830
MY ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON?

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.799
JUST... WATCH!

00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:46.770
[THINKING] KALIN'S RIGHT
ABOUT MY TWO WARRIORS

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.472
NOT BEING STRONG ENOUGH
TO STAND UP

00:20:48.472 --> 00:20:51.375
AGAINST HIS
ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.344
BUT WHOEVER SAID
THEY WOULD HAVE TO...

00:20:54.344 --> 00:20:56.079
NOT ME...

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:58.782
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
OF SACRIFICE!

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:01.885
NOW WHEN THE TOTAL
ATTACK POINTS

00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:03.587
OF THE MONSTERS
ON MY FIELD

00:21:03.587 --> 00:21:05.789
ARE LESS THAN YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS,

00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:08.258
I GET TO DRAW TWO CARDS.

00:21:08.258 --> 00:21:10.227
THING IS, I CAN'T
SUMMON OR CHANGE

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.563
THE BATTLE MODE OF
ANY OF MY MONSTERS THEN.

00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:14.097
[LAUGHS]

00:21:14.097 --> 00:21:18.302
YUSEI, YOU'VE LEFT YOURSELF
WIDE OPEN, REVENGE IS MINE!

00:21:18.302 --> 00:21:20.304
DON'T BE SO SURE KALIN,

00:21:20.304 --> 00:21:22.739
REMEMBER DUE TO
THE TRAP I ACTIVATED

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:25.576
I NOW GET TO DRAW TWO
NEW CARDS FROM MY DECK

00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:28.679
SINCE MY WARRIORS
AREN'T AS STRONG
AS YOUR DRAGON.

00:21:28.679 --> 00:21:30.447
IT'S MY MOVE THEN!

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.985
AND I THINK I'LL
PLAY A FACEDOWN!

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:38.355
NEXT I'LL ACTIVATE
ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:21:38.355 --> 00:21:40.223
WHICH ENABLES IT
TO ABSORB THE POWERS

00:21:40.223 --> 00:21:43.193
OF A DARK ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
IN MY GRAVEYARD!

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:48.999
AND THE MONSTER I'M CHOOSING
IS INFERNITY NECROMANCER.

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:51.335
NOW THAT I HAVE
NO MORE CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:21:51.335 --> 00:21:54.037
I CAN SUMMON OUT
INFERNITY ARCHFIEND!

00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:00.677
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE MOVE I WAS
HOPING YOU WOULD MAKE!

00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:02.613
SINCE YOU SUMMONED
A MONSTER

00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:04.915
THE EFFECT OF
SLIP SUMMON ACTIVATES...

00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:06.350
AND THAT MEANS
I CAN SUMMON

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.518
ONE LEVEL
4-OR-BELOW MONSTER

00:22:08.518 --> 00:22:10.487
FROM MY HAND
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:22:10.487 --> 00:22:13.190
SO I'M CALLING ON
GHOST GARDNA!

00:22:14.925 --> 00:22:17.260
[CHUCKLES] IT MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE
WHO YOU CALL ON

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.662
BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO

00:22:18.662 --> 00:22:21.999
TO ESCAPE THE POWER OF MY
ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON!

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:24.868
NOW SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR SPEED WARRIOR!

00:22:30.073 --> 00:22:32.242
MY WARRIOR'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE!

00:22:32.242 --> 00:22:34.945
SEE BY ACTIVATING
GARDNA'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:22:34.945 --> 00:22:37.180
I CAN MAKE IT THE TARGET
OF YOUR ATTACK!

00:22:38.548 --> 00:22:41.318
QUITE THE NIFTY MANEUVER,
BUT LET'S SEE HOW

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:43.286
IT MATCHES UP
AGAINST THIS ONE.

00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:46.423
I ACTIVATE ONE HUNDRED-EYED
DRAGON'S SPECIAL ABILITY

00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:47.658
WHICH ENABLES ME
TO CHANNEL

00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:50.260
MY INFERNITY DWARF'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.429
AND SINCE I HAVE
NO CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:22:52.429 --> 00:22:55.332
WHEN MY MONSTER ATTACKS
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:57.234
YOUR LIFE POINTS
TAKE A DIRECT HIT!

00:22:58.535 --> 00:23:00.404
[SCREAMING]

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.243
[LAUGHS]
YUSEI!

00:23:06.243 --> 00:23:10.747
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR GAME
IS SPINNING OUT OF
CONTROL...[LAUGHS]

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.555
BUT NOW THAT
YOU'RE BACK ON TRACK,

00:23:15.555 --> 00:23:17.466
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO GET SERIOUS

00:23:17.466 --> 00:23:19.801
AND SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
