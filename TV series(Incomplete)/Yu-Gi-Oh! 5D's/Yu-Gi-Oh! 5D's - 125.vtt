00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:27.467
CLEARLY HE'S PLANNING TO
SUMMON A SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.836
AND I SAY, GO RIGHT AHEAD.

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:32.572
NO MONSTER STANDS
A CHANCE AGAINST THOR.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.909
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.980
THEN NOW IT'S THE
MASTER OF FASTER'S TURN.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.316
SO HERE GOES

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:46.753
FIRST I PLAY THE EFFECT OF THE
FIELD SPELL SPEED WORLD 2

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:50.256
NOW BY REMOVING
4 SPEED COUNTERS,

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:53.126
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.596
FOR EACH SPEED SPELL
CARD IN MY HAND

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.765
[GRUNT]

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.334
I SEE, JACK. SINCE YOU CAN'T
HURT THOR,

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:03.903
YOU'VE SET YOUR SIGHTS ON MY
LIFE POINTS INSTEAD.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:05.805
WISHFUL THINKING, DRAGAN.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:09.742
NOT ONLY CAN I HURT
THOR, BUT I WILL TOO, RIGHT NOW

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.744
HERE'S YOUR FIRST
HELPING OF PUNISHMENT

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:15.715
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
DESCENDING LOST STAR.

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:18.351
IT LETS ME BRING ONE
SYNCHRO MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.120
BACK TO THE
FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.855
SO RISE AGAIN

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.990
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:29.362
[ROAR]

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:32.265
HOWEVER, DUE TO DESCENDING
LOST STAR,

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:34.067
ARCHFIEND'S ABILITY IS NEGATED,

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:37.137
HIS LEVEL IS DECREASED,
HIS DEFENSE POINTS BECOME ZERO

00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:39.739
AND HE CAN NO LONGER
CHANGE BATTLE MODES.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:42.041
SO YOU BROUGHT HIM
BACK TO BATTLE

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.544
SIMPLY TO USE AS
A GREAT BIG SHIELD?

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.379
IF ONLY YOU WERE
SO LUCKY, DRAGAN.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:49.048
SAY WHAT?

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:52.952
DRAGAN, I WANT YOU TO LOOK VERY
CLOSELY UPON ME.

00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:57.056
DO YOU SEE THIS GLOW? IT'S THE
GLOW OF MY RAGING SPIRIT.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.159
MY BLAZING SOUL

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:03.096
LEVEL 4 TOP RUNNER AND
LEVEL 1 BARRIER RESONATOR

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:07.133
DOUBLE TUNE NOW WITH LEVEL
7 RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.101
OH NO

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:09.736
HOLD ON, DOUBLE TUNE?

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:12.338
[♪...]

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:22.015
BEHOLD AS THE STARS
HIGH ABOVE IN THE SKY

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.618
AND THE FIRE DEEP DOWN
BELOW IN THE EARTH

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:30.757
COLLIDE IN A COSMIC
EXPLOSION TO SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:33.359
RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:38.898
Red Nova Dragon is a level
12 dragon-type monster

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:42.869
with 3500 attack points
and 3000 defense points.

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:46.339
[CHEERING CROWD]

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.974
THAT THING'S HUGE.

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.676
THERE'S NO WAY
JACK CAN LOSE NOW.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:51.277
AWESOME

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.846
ALL RIGHT. TIME TO TURN THIS
DUEL AROUND, JACK.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.615
LET'S GO

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:13.666
[ENGINE ROAR]

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.035
ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.038
TWO TITANS ARE ABOUT
TO GO TOE TO TOE

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:22.175
WHAT IS THAT MONSTER?

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:29.282
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEAST
BEFORE - I HAVE NO DATA ON IT

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:33.052
YUSEI? WHERE'D JACK GET THAT
CARD?

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.454
NOT SURE

00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:38.224
BUT IT SEEMS ALMOST AS IF
IT'S A PART OF WHO HE IS.

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.760
THE RED NOVA DRAGON

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.197
MY RUNE EYE SENSES A
GREAT DEAL OF POWER.

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.232
[ELECTRICAL SOUNDS]

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.671
YUSEI, LOOK

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:54.240
RED NOVA DRAGON
AND THOR

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.610
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE SQUARING OFF

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.047
SEEMS TODAY YOU'VE DECIDED
TO UNVEIL A NEW MONSTER

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:02.382
SO BE IT.

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:04.317
LET'S SEE JUST
WHAT'S HE GOT

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:06.352
NOW JACK, DO YOUR WORST.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:10.323
IMPOSSIBLE SEE RED NOVA
DRAGON GAINS 500 ATTACK POINTS

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:12.892
FOR EVERY TUNER
MONSTER THAT'S IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:16.329
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TWO -
TOP RUNNER AND BARRIER
RESONATOR,

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:18.698
SO NOVA
POWERS UP BY 1000

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:21.167
4500 ATTACK POINTS?

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.869
NOVA'S THE
STRONGER MONSTER

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:27.507
RIGHT. THOR, LORD OF THE AESIR
HAS JUST 3500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:29.676
SO THAT MEANS IF RED
NOVA DRAGON ATTACKS

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:30.977
AND DESTROYS THOR

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:33.046
1000 POINTS OF
DAMAGE WILL BE DEALT

00:13:33.046 --> 00:13:35.581
AND DRAGAN WILL HAVE JUST
200 LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.717
AND THE BEST PART
IS, ON THE NEXT TURN,

00:13:37.717 --> 00:13:40.353
JACK WILL HAVE ACCUMULATED
4 SPEED COUNTERS

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:42.588
SO IF HE USES SPEED
WORLD 2'S EFFECT

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:45.692
THEN NO MATTER WHAT MONSTER
DRAGAN HAS OUT ON DEFENSE.

00:13:45.692 --> 00:13:49.062
JACK CAN STILL DEAL HIM
800 POUNDING POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:51.531
AND THAT'S MORE
THAN ENOUGH TO BEAT

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:53.433
HIM IN THIS DUEL.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.102
NOW, RED
NOVA DRAGON, ATTACK THOR,

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:58.104
LORD OF THE AESIR

00:13:58.104 --> 00:14:01.140
GO BLAZING SOUL STRIKE.

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:05.578
IT SEEMS YOU STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:08.047
THE THREE NORDIC GODS
AREN'T SIMPLY DUEL CARDS,

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:10.783
THEY WERE ONCE REAL
AND RULED THE EARTH

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:13.119
THEREFORE THEIR POWER
IS REAL, AS WELL

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:15.888
AND THE LIKES OF YOU
WILL NEVER VANQUISH IT

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.657
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN.

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:20.193
THE TRAP RAGING
SACRED CURSE

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.961
I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO
ACTIVATE THIS CARD WHEN A

00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.097
GOD IS PRESENT
ON MY FIELD

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:27.500
A GOD LIKE THOR AND
BECAUSE HE IS,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.535
I CAN NOW REDUCE ONE
OF YOUR MONSTER'S

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.472
ATTACK POINTS BY 2000.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:34.474
OH NO, RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:37.443
OH YES, AND THE MONSTER
AFFECTED BY SACRED CURSE

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:39.145
CAN'T BE DISAFFECTED WITH
ANY OF YOUR SPELL

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:40.179
OR TRAP CARDS.

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.214
NO!

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.449
NEXT I ACTIVATE
ANOTHER TRAP CARD.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:44.584
SOLEMN AUTHORITY

00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:48.488
NOW, UNTIL MY SECOND
STANDBY PHASE, THOR,

00:14:48.488 --> 00:14:51.357
LORD OF THE AESIR ISN'T
AFFECTED BY THE EFFECTS

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:55.294
OF ANY TRAP CARDS THAT YOU
MAY SEEK TO ENSNARE HIM WITH.

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.529
AH.

00:14:56.529 --> 00:14:59.065
AW, GREAT

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.967
AND THINGS WE'RE
LOOKING SO BRIGHT.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:02.702
NOW, SO LONG AS THOR
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:05.138
NOT ONLY CAN JACK NOT USE
A SPELL OR TRAP CARD TO

00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:07.039
POWER UP RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:09.876
BUT HE CAN'T ACTIVATE ANY
TRAP CARD AGAINST THOR,

00:15:09.876 --> 00:15:11.511
LORD OF THE AESIR EITHER.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.079
ACCEPT IT JACK,

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:15.348
YOU'VE BEEN OUTMANEUVERED,
OUTMATCHED AND STRAIGHT UP

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:16.482
OUT DUELED.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:17.784
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:15:17.784 --> 00:15:20.153
POOR JACK,
HE'S CLEARLY IN DENIAL.

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:23.489
AFTER ALL, THOR,
HAS 3500 ATTACK POINTS,

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.826
AND JACK'S RED NOVA DRAGON
NOW HAS BUT 2500.

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.094
WHEN THIS BATTLE
CONCLUDES,

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.463
JACK WILL TAKE 1000
POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:33.433
AND SINCE HE ONLY HAS A MERE
900 LEFT HE'LL LOSE.

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.035
AHH.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.904
IT'S OVER JACK.

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:42.041
GO THUNDER BOLT BLUDGEOUN!

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:44.377
SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALL
COMING DOWN TO THIS.

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:47.580
SO IF YOU'RE WITH ME
FRIENDS LET ME KNOW.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.649
WE ARE. WE'RE HERE.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:51.784
FEEL US, AND THE BOND WE SHARE.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.353
GO JACK!

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.756
I ACTIVATE MY
FACEDOWN CARD,

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:57.957
THE TRAP BURNING REBIRTH.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.694
WITH IT, I RELEASE
RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:06.933
(EXPLOSION)

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.367
YOU'RE DUMPING HIM ?

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:11.237
THAT'S RIGHT. BECAUSE DUE TO
BURNING REBIRTH'S EFFECT,

00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:13.272
BY SACRIFICING
RED NOVA DRAGON,

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:16.976
I CAN THEN BRING BACK RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.145
AND THIS TIME IT'S
EQUIPPED WITH BURNING REBIRTH.

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:21.781
HOWEVER, WHEN I GET
RID OF BURNING REBIRTH,

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:24.650
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND MUST
LEAVE THE FIELD WITH IT.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.552
HOW'S THIS HAPPENING?

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:28.488
I THOUGHT RED NOVA
DRAGON COULD NO LONGER BE

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.990
AFFECTED BY JACK'S
SPELLS OR TRAPS.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.124
HE CAN'T BE.

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:33.893
BUT JACK DIDN'T USE HIS
TRAP'S EFFECT

00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:35.161
ON RED NOVA DRAGON...

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.898
YOU SEE, LEO, IN ORDER
TO USE BURNING REBIRTH...

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:41.467
JACK HAD TO RELEASE
NOVA AS A COST.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:45.605
UH-HUH - AND NOW DRAGAN'S
FINALLY GONNA PAY THE PRICE.

00:17:01.087 --> 00:17:02.622
RISE UP

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:04.323
MIGHTY RED
DRAGON ARCHFIEND.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:07.894
[ROARING]

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:19.171
THAT WAS VERY CLEVER TO
DISMISS NOVA, JACK...

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:23.009
HOWEVER, ARCHFIEND HAS
JUST 3000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:26.546
THOR, LORD OF THE AESIR
OVERPOWERS HIM BY 500.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.181
WE'LL SEE JUST ABOUT THAT.

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:30.283
YOU SEE, DRAGAN.

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:32.385
BURNING REBIRTH HAS
A SECOND EFFECT.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.555
BY SENDING A TUNER MONSTER
AND REBIRTH TO THE GRAVE

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.356
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
THE SYNCHRO

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:38.958
I FIRST RELEASED...

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.393
SO GUESS WHO'S
COMING BACK.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:41.561
OH NO!

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.396
NOW THIS CARD
FROM MY HAND

00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:45.998
ALONG WITH DRAGON
ARCHFIEND AND THE BURNING

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:48.601
REBIRTH OUT ON MY FIELD
WILL BE SACRIFICED SO

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:50.636
A GREAT POWER CAN
RISE ONCE MORE.

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:57.710
NOW WITHOUT
ANY FURTHER ADO

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.781
RETURN TO THE DUEL,
MIGHTY RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:07.587
[BIG ROAR]

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.156
AND DUE TO NOVA DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.491
AN ADDITIONAL 500
POINTS ARE INFUSED INTO

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.026
HIS ATTACKING
TOTAL FOR EVERY

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.095
TUNER MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:17.296
SO SINCE I HAVE THREE

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:20.600
TRAP EATER, TOP RUNNER AND
BARRIER RESONATOR

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.502
RED NOVA DRAGON'S ASSAULT
CAPABILITIES ARE UPGRADED

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.639
BY A POWER-PACKED 1500.

00:18:26.639 --> 00:18:29.075
5000 ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:30.776
AMAZING!

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.912
BY SENDING RED NOVA DRAGON
TO THE GRAVE AND THEN

00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.680
RE-SUMMONING HIM
TO THE FIELD,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.382
JACK WAS ABLE TO SIDE
STEP THE EFFECT

00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:38.184
OF RAGING SACRED CURSE.

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:41.520
I'VE NEVER WITNESSED
SUCH A STRATEGY BEFORE.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.089
AND TO MAKE
MATTERS WORSE...

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:45.191
NOVA'S NOW
STRONGER THAN THOR.

00:18:45.191 --> 00:18:47.059
MUCH STRONGER.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.861
WAY TO GO, JACK.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.296
NOW TAKE HIM DOWN, BUDDY.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.998
I INTEND TO.

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:56.435
RED NOVA DRAGON, ATTACK
WITH BURNING SOUL STRIKE.

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:57.470
[BIG ROAR]

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.072
[EXPLOSION]

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:09.348
AAH.

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:11.417
DRAGAN.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.360
AND
THE DUEL BETWEEN JACK AND

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.962
DRAGAN HAS BEEN DECIDED.

00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:25.331
BEHOLD, YOUR VICTOR.

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:28.501
ALRIGHT. AWESOME. RIGHT ON.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.535
HE DID IT.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:30.836
JACK WON, YUSEI.

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:33.773
YEAH.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:35.675
(CHEERING) YEAH. ALRIGHT.

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.842
HOORAY. YEAH.

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.311
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU
COULD DO IT, JACKIE.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.413
GREAT JOB.

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:44.083
JACK... WON...?

00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:46.352
I'M SO
RELIEVED HE'S NOT GOING TO

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:49.088
KNOCK ME OUT THAT I
COULD JUST PASS OUT.

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:51.457
(UH, AH)

00:19:51.457 --> 00:19:54.093
THIS CROWD IS GOING
COMPLETELY CRAZY FOR JACK.

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:56.429
GRRR.

00:19:56.429 --> 00:20:00.399
WELL IT
SEEMS THAT YOU TRULY ARE A
CHAMPION, JACK ATLAS.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:05.271
DRAGAN, THIS DUEL WITH YOU HAS
TAUGHT ME NOT TO CARE ABOUT
TITLES ANYMORE.

00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:08.207
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
THAT REALLY MATTERS NOW.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:10.409
WHERE ALL MY FOCUS IS.

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:11.977
AND WHERE'S THAT?

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.581
IT'S GETTING TO THE GRAND
PRIX FINALS AND STOPPING
TEAM NEW WORLD.

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:20.319
I SEE.

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:23.322
IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU AND I ARE
NOT ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:25.925
AFTER ALL, IT'S BECOME
QUITE CLEAR THAT WE BOTH

00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:27.626
HAVE THE SAME ULTIMATE GOAL.

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:31.497
BUT JACK, ONLY ONE OF
US CAN REACH THAT GOAL.

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:33.733
AND EVEN THOUGH I
DO RESPECT YOU NOW,

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.736
I CAN'T LET IT BE YOU.

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:41.774
IT WILL BE MY TEAM -
THE TEAM WITH THE RUNE EYES.

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:44.210
TEAM RAGNAROCK.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.911
WHAT'S THIS ?

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.080
NO WAY.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.149
WHAT'S THAT SHAKING?

00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:55.387
[METAL CLANGS]

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:57.456
[THUNDER STRIKES]

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.174
[THUNDER STRIKES]

00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:35.528
HE'S BACK?

00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:37.129
YEAH IT SURE
LOOKS THAT WAY.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.430
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.667
I MAY HAVE LOST,
BUT THOR HAS NOT.

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.836
YOU SEE, WHEN A GOD ON
THE FIELD IS DESTROYED AND

00:21:43.836 --> 00:21:46.038
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD,
HE'S SUMMONED BACK TO THE

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:47.907
FIELD DURING THAT
TURN'S END PHASE.

00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:49.041
HE'S WHAT?

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:50.709
THAT'S RIGHT, JACK ATLAS.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.145
YOUR MIGHTY RED NOVA
DRAGON MAY HAVE WON THIS

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:56.515
EARLY BATTLE, BUT THE
WAR IS FAR FROM OVER.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:59.618
OH AND WHEN THOR IS RE-SUMMONED
DUE TO THIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:03.355
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:04.790
[EXPLOSION]

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.959
AAAH.

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.227
[ALL GASP]

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:09.628
HE'S DRIFTING AWAY.

00:22:09.628 --> 00:22:11.764
Yusei: JACK, NO!
