YOU BEAT ME ONCE JACK,

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:18.318
Jack: YOU'LL NEVER
WIN THIS DUEL YUSEI!

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:21.622
Yusei: YOU SURE
ARE SURE OF YOURSELF.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.958
JUST SURE... THAT I'M
GOING TO BEAT YOU!

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.227
YUSEI... BRING IT ON!

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.929
YOU GOT IT JACK!

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.239
IT'S MY TRAP:
SHADOW SPELL!

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.041
AND WITH IT I'M GOING
TO FINALLY PUT AN
END TO YOUR

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.076
UNBEATEN STREAK YUSEI!

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.281
NOW MAD ARCHFIEND,

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.649
UH!

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.486
HOW DID I LET THAT
HAPPEN?!

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.824
Jack: HE DID.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:01:00.294
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY
OUR FRIEND JUST LOST?

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:02.829
BECAUSE HIS DECK
HAS NO BALANCE.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.231
AND WITHOUT BALANCE.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.767
ONE CANNOT BE A
COMPLETE DUELIST.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.603

Jack, voice-over: AHH,
NOW THIS IS THE VIEW

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.006
THAT I WAS ALWAYS
MEANT TO HAVE,

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:23.010
EVEN IF I DID HAVE TO DOUBLE
CROSS A FEW FRIENDS TO GET IT.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.679
HMMPH, AND TO THINK THAT IT
WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO THAT

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.914
I WAS LIVING AMONGST
THE LOSERS AND GARBAGE

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.683
OF THE SATELLITE.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:32.519
WELL I'M GLAD THAT
NIGHTMARE IS OVER...

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.155
HMM. STARDUST DRAGON...

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:37.858
I WONDER IF YUSEI
STILL MISSES YOU?

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.293
Goodwin:
QUITE THE VIEW
ISN'T IT JACK?

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.763
STILL THINKING
ABOUT YOUR DAYS
IN THE SATELLITE?

00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:45.298
IM DONE THINKING ABOUT
THAT DUMP GOODWIN.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.667
THAT'S GOOD JACK.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.201
BECAUSE DWELLING
IN THE PAST CAN
SOMETIMES COST YOU

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:49.770
YOUR FUTURE.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.872
AND WE'VE WORKED TOO
HARD TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.374
NOW SHOULDN'T YOU BE
FOCUSING ON YOUR
MATCH THIS EVENING...

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:56.576
HMM.

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.079
I'M PLENTY FOCUSED GOODWIN.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.482
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ME DWELLING ON THE PAST.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.518
CAUSE IF I HAD MY WAY,
THE SATELLITE WOULD'VE BEEN

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.486
DESTROYED YEARS AGO!

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.522
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.658
BUT THE SATELLITE PLAYS A
VALUABLE ROLE IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.960
EVERYONE HAS BEEN GIVEN A
ROLE IN LIFE; THOSE FROM

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.197
THE SATELLITE EXIST SO THAT
THE CHOSEN MAY PROSPER.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.166
THEY KEEP OUR CITY FUNCTIONING
BY RECYCLING WHAT

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.001
THE CHOSEN DISCARD.

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.336
WITHOUT THE SATELLITE,
NEW DOMINO CITY COULD

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.938
NOT EXIST.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.941
GLAMOROUS A ROLE IT IS NOT,
BUT A NECESSARY ONE

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.810
FOR EVERYONE'S SURVIVAL.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.212
BUT YOU KNOW THAT
ALREADY DON'T YOU JACK?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.648
HOW SILLY OF ME TO GIVE A
HISTORY LESSON TO SOMEONE WHO

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.717
EXPERIENCED IT FIRST HAND.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.286
NOW LEAVE YOUR MEMORIES OF
THAT PLACE WHERE THEY BELONG.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.555
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
MAKE NEW ONES!

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.690
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.460
BUT WHAT IF MY PAST
COMES LOOKING
FOR ME...

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:56.570
AH.

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.375
AH!

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.278
YUSEI!

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.214
THAT'S YOUR BEST TIME YET!

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.715
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE FAST
ENOUGH TO GET YOU TO NEW

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.751
DOMINO CITY?

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:11.918
IT BETTER BE.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.254
I JUST KNOW IT'S GONNA WORK!

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.522
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:17.390
TIME ME AGAIN.

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:26.633
Goodwin: JACK YOU'RE A PART
OF NEW DOMINO CITY NOW,

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.437
AND THE ONLY
LINK YOU HAVE TO THE
SATELLITE IS YUSEI FUDO.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.272
AND YOU CAN REST
ASSURED...

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.807
THAT WE'RE TAKING
EVERY PRECAUTION

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:35.642
TO KEEP
THAT LINK BURIED.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.825
Tank: OKAY NERVIN, YOUR TURN.

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:53.932
Nervin: I'M THINKIN'
A CHEESEBURGER

00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:56.768
WITH BACON AND EXTRA
ONION RINGS!

00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:58.403
OOOOOOOOH!

00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:01.406
DON'T FORGET DA FRENCH
FRIES AND AN EXTRA
THICK MILKSHAKE!

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:03.108
GOOD ONE!

00:05:03.108 --> 00:05:04.209
OR LEMONADE!

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:05.577
Tank: MMMMMMM!

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:07.345
BUT NOTHING BEATS DIPPING
HOT FRENCH FRIES INTO A COLD

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:08.847
CHOCOLATE SHAKE.

00:05:08.847 --> 00:05:10.515
IT REALLY BRINGS
OUT THE FLAVOR.

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.484
OH, I CAN DREAM
ABOUT IT.

00:05:12.484 --> 00:05:15.253

ACTUALLY CALLED A TRIP.

00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:28.333

00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:02.834
HURTS SO MUCH?!

00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:05.604
I THOUGHT THAT YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING
RALLY!

00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:07.305
YEAH AND I GUESS I
DID TOO

00:06:07.305 --> 00:06:09.841
WHEN I STOOD
UP AGAINST THAT BULLY.

00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:12.244
BOY WAS I WRONG; I MEAN
THEY JUST RAN OVER US.

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:13.578
Nervin: I KNOW!

00:06:13.578 --> 00:06:14.746
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
A CHANCE

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:16.681
TO GET IN
THE FETAL POSITION.

00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:20.018

NEW SHOES FOR THAT GUY!

00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:22.287

HA! YOU SHOULDA SEEN HIM
AND HIS RUNNER SPEEDIN'

THEN SCHROOOM!

00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:39.170
YUSEI, ARE YOU GONNA
GO FOR IT TONIGHT?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.940
YOU GONNA TRY AND GET TO

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.875

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.278
UH... DOES ANYBODY ASIDE
FROM ME HAVE A BAD FEELING

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:48.079
ABOUT ALL THIS?

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.315
I DO, BUT THAT'S
NOT REALLY SAYING

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:54.052
MUCH 'CAUSE I ALWAYS
GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING.

00:06:54.052 --> 00:06:56.454
HE-YEAH... BUT DON'T WORRY
GUYS, BECAUSE I GOT IT ALL

00:06:56.454 --> 00:06:58.590
PLANNED OUT - I THINK.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.026
HUH?
HUH?

00:07:01.026 --> 00:07:03.495
Trudge: CAPTAIN,
I KNOW YOU'RE LESS THAN
HAPPY ABOUT YUSEI GETTING

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:07.232
AWAY... BUT IS THIS NEW
PURSUIT DECK REALLY NECESSARY?

00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:10.135
CAUSE I DON'T NEED ANY HELP
CATCHING THAT SATELLITE!

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:12.804
WELL JUDGING FROM
YOUR LAST DUEL WITH HIM
I BEG TO DIFFER.

00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:15.073
NOW LISTEN UP, IF I HAD
MY WAY YOU WOULD HAVE
BEEN HANDING

00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:17.475
OUT PARKING TICKETS
UNTIL YOU RETIRE
AND THIS SPECIAL

00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:20.312
PURSUIT DECK WOULD'VE GONE TO
SOMEONE WHO GOES BY THE BOOK!

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:22.647
BUT APPARENTLY MR. JACK
ATLAS THINKS YOU DESERVE

00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:24.215
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:07:24.215 --> 00:07:27.585
AND WHEN JACK ATLAS SAYS
"DO SOMETHING," I DO IT.

00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.287
SO WHAT ARE MY ORDERS?

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:32.424
FIND YUSEI AND HIS DUEL
RUNNER AND BRING THEM IN.

00:07:32.424 --> 00:07:34.259
THERE ARE SOME VERY POWERFUL
PEOPLE THAT WANT HIM OFF

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.362
THE STREETS PERMANENTLY!

00:07:37.362 --> 00:07:39.597
UNDERSTOOD CAPTAIN.

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:42.133
AND JUST YOU REMEMBER
THERE ARE NO THIRD CHANCES

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:43.501
WITH MR. ATLAS!

00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:47.038
AM I MAKING MYSELF PERFECTLY
CLEAR, OFFICER TRUDGE?

00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:48.373
YES SIR.

00:07:48.373 --> 00:07:50.775
HE MAY HAVE CAUGHT ME
OFF GUARD
IN OUR LAST DUEL

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:52.744
BUT NEXT TIME I'LL BE
READY...

00:07:52.744 --> 00:07:54.579
AND WILL HE EVER BE
SURPRISED!

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:57.782
THANK YOU SIR - YOU
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.

00:07:57.782 --> 00:08:00.585
WHEN YOU LOCK ONTO
THE CHIP'S HOMING
SIGNAL LET ME KNOW!

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.693
SO WHAT'S THIS PLAN YOU
THINK MIGHT WORK YUSEI?

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:11.096
OH IT'S GONNA
WORK TANK!

00:08:11.096 --> 00:08:13.298
WELL I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT RALLY!

00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:16.334
CAUSE IF EVERYTHING FALLS
INTO PLACE... STARDUST
DRAGON WILL

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:18.269
BE MINE AGAIN AND WE'LL ALL
BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO LEAVING

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:19.738
THE SATELLITE.

00:08:19.738 --> 00:08:22.874
Blitz: YUSE ARE
YA SURE THAT CARD
IS WORTH THE RISK?

00:08:22.874 --> 00:08:24.275
I MEAN... YOU REALLY THINK
THAT CARD'S GONNA MAKE

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:26.378
A DIFFERENCE?

00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:28.646
Tank: OF COURSE IT
WILL - DON'T YOU
REMEMBER THE FEELING WHEN YOU

00:08:28.646 --> 00:08:30.548
FIRST SAW IT IN ACTION?

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:32.584
CAUSE I'LL NEVER FORGET IT!

00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:35.220
SEEING THE DUEL RUNNER YUSEI
BUILT FROM SPARE PARTS FROM

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.489
THE RECYCLING
CENTER WAS AMAZING.

00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:39.624
AND THEN WHEN YUSE STARTED IT
UP AND SHOWED US WHAT IT COULD

00:08:39.624 --> 00:08:43.228
DO, IT WAS LIKE A WHOLE
NEW WORLD OPENED UP.

00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:45.797
Nervin: YEAH,
AND THEN WHEN HE
SUMMONED HIS STARDUST

IS THIS SEWER PIPELINE HERE.

00:09:23.501 --> 00:09:26.771
PROBLEM IS, THEY FLOOD IT

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:30.742
BUT, ONCE A MONTH AT MIDNIGHT,
THEY SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN TO

00:09:30.742 --> 00:09:32.510
CHECK THE COMPRESSOR PUMPS.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.712

ROPES THERE FOR AWHILE

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:01.902

00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:03.236
BUT AN OLD FRIEND
ONCE TOLD ME

00:20:03.236 --> 00:20:05.405

00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:13.046
OUT OF ANY SITUATION...

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.981
YUSEI,
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO RELY

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.816
ON YOUR ENTIRE DECK.

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:19.085
DON'T YOU SEE THAT YOU COULD
HAVE BEATEN ME TODAY IF YOU

ONLY BELIEVED IN THE STRENGTH
OF EVERY CARD YOU DUEL WITH?

THAT DAY - A VERY VALUABLE
LESSON WAS TAUGHT TO ME.

A LESSON - THAT
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

00:20:31.398 --> 00:20:34.100

THE STRENGTH TO

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:36.970
WIN THIS DUEL.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:41.374
MAN, I THOUGHT THAT
RUNNER WAS MINE.
