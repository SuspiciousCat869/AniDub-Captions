A LITTLE MONEY AND MAKE
THEM SIGN A CONTRACT,

OF THOSE THINGS.

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:37.737
OH!

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:40.206
OH!

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:41.441
All: PIERO!

00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:43.309
YEAH!
WAY TO GO, JACK!

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.877
TAKE IT RIGHT TO HIM!

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:47.413
WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN
WAS MARCO'S ADVICE.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.248
BUT SINCE YOU DECIDED
NOT TO,

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:50.483
YOU'RE DEEPER IN DEBT.

00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:53.152
BECAUSE WHEN NEFARIOUS TRADER
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:56.422
ANOTHER LOAN TOKEN
IS SUMMONED ONTO YOUR FIELD!

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.590
HUH!

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.958
NOW HE'S GOT TWO TOKENS!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.027
AND IF JACK SUMMONS
ANY MONSTERS,

00:16:01.027 --> 00:16:02.462
HE'LL ONLY GET MORE
OF THEM.

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:04.630
SO THEN WHAT'S
HE SUPPOSED TO DO?

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.098
SIMPLE!

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:09.302
HE SHOULD DO SOME BUSINESS
WITH ME AND PAY A CARD!

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.903
JACK, JUST PAY!

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.738
OTHERWISE,
NEXT ROUND YOU'LL--

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:13.773
Jack: I REFUSE!

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:16.976
I PLAY TWO FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN!

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.245
FINE,
REFUSE TO PAY A CARD.

00:16:19.245 --> 00:16:21.681
INSTEAD I'M JUST GOING
TO MAKE YOU PAY THE PRICE.

00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:24.183
AND A VERY HEFTY PRICE
IT'S GOING TO BE!

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:26.786
I EQUIP THE SPELL
ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:30.089
ONTO TOICHI THE NEFARIOUS
DEBT COLLECTOR!

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.125
THIS DOUBLES
ALL EFFECT DAMAGES!

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.627
WAIT...

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:35.928
THEN WITH
TWO TOKENS OUT,

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.763
THE DAMAGE JACK'S
GONNA TAKE WILL BE...

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:39.298
A LOT!

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.968
TIME TO COLLECT
OUR DEBT, TOICHI!

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.573
♪ ♪

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.349
♪ ♪

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:02.989
IT'S TIME YOU GAVE DON PIERO
SOME RESPECT!!

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:06.559
AND BY RESPECT I MEAN 4,000
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.994
UH!

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:11.597
JACK!
OH, NO!

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:14.200
JUST FACE IT, JACK.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.003
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE LAST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:18.371
YOU'LL DO AS I SAY!

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.805
HE'S RIGHT, JACK!

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.307
JUST GIVE UP
SOME OF YOUR CARDS!

00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:22.675
NO WAY!

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.677
I'M NOT GOING TO
PLAY BY HIS RULES!

00:17:24.677 --> 00:17:25.811
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.747
AND FIRST,

00:17:27.747 --> 00:17:30.316
BY SENDING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:31.884
I'M GOING TO SUMMON
THIS MONSTER!

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.086
COME OUT!
SMILE KID!

00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:38.691
Duel Runner Computer:
WHEN THE MONSTER CARD SMILE KID

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:40.426
IS DESTROYED BY A CARD EFFECT,

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:44.363
YOU CAN SUMMON ONE SMILE ANGEL
FROM YOUR DECK ONTO THE FIELD.

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:47.033
BUT SMILE KID?
THAT'S MY CARD!

00:17:47.033 --> 00:17:49.335
AH, THAT WAS
AN EXCELLENT MOVE, JACK,

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:50.736
EXCELLENT FOR ME,
THAT IS!

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.172
BECAUSE NOW
ENDLESS LOAN ACTIVATES!

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.375
WHICH MEANS ANOTHER LOAN TOKEN
WILL APPEAR ON YOUR FIELD.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:01.247
OH! THAT MAKES
THREE NOW!

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:04.283
COME ON, JACK!
YOU CAN'T OWE ANYMORE!

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:05.885
JUST GIVE UP SOME CARDS
FROM YOUR HAND!

00:18:05.885 --> 00:18:08.220
OH, I WILL,
BUT NOT FOR PIERO!

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.290
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP COMPULSORY
RECOIL DEVICE!

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.493
NOW BY SENDING
ONE CARD IN MY HAND

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.096
I CAN RETURN ONE MONSTER
ON MY FIELD TO MY HAND!

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:19.265
NEXT, I'LL SEND
ANOTHER CARD IN MY HAND

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:23.402
TO THE GRAVE
AND RE-SUMMON
SMILE KID!

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:26.405
WHAT? ALL THAT

THE SAME MONSTER?

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:28.374
HERE COMES
ANOTHER TOKEN...

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.176
OH, MAYBE NOT...

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:31.544
OH, RIGHT!

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:32.645
SINCE JACK'S FIELD
IS FULL,

00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:34.113
NO MORE MONSTERS
CAN FIT ON IT!

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.514
ALL RIGHT, YOU FOOL,

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.350
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE QUITE HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.119
YOU GOT RID OF YOUR CARDS
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.587
BUT WHAT DID YOU PROVE?

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.089
TOICHI IS STILL
GOING TO TAKE OUT

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:45.324
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE POINTS
NEXT ROUND!

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:47.360
IT'S DONE!
YOU'VE LOST!

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.028
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS...

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:58.638
JACK...

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.673
NOT JUST YET.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:01.674
HUH?

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:03.909
GO TIME.

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.879
I PLAY ZERO HOLE! GO!

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:08.280
ZERO HOLE?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.883
WITH ZERO HOLE,
IF JACK HAS NO
CARDS IN HIS HAND,

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:13.019
THEN ALL CARDS ON THE
FIELD ARE DESTROYED.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:15.521
SAY WHAT?!
ALL OF THE CARDS?!

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:18.190
OH, SO THEN THAT'S
WHY JACK WAS DISCARDING
FROM HIS HAND!

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.492
UH-HUH.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:26.699
AH! AH!

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.806
AND KNOWING JACK LIKE I DO,
HE'S NOT DONE YET.

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:37.943
NEXT I ACTIVATE
SMILE KID'S ABILITY!

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:40.379
AND NOW THAT
I HAVE SMILE ANGEL
ON THE FIELD,

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:43.449
I CAN TURN MARCO'S
FROWN UPSIDE DOWN.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:44.684

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.218
1,800 ATTACK POINTS?!

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.653
GOT THAT RIGHT!

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:51.691
AND THAT'S ENOUGH
TO TAKE YOU DOWN!

00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:53.325

00:20:06.739 --> 00:20:08.340
THE DON NEVER LOSES
A DUEL!

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.676
YOU LOST MORE
THAN JUST THAT.

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:11.977
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.813
NOW HAND OVER THOSE
CONTRACTS RIGHT NOW.

THANK YOU SO MUCH, JACK.

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:30.796
AND DON'T FORGET
THESE.

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:32.765

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:33.999
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.534
I HEARD YOU WHEN
YOU MADE THAT WISH...

00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:38.471
I KNOW IT'S YOUR DREAM

BUT THAT'S WHY YOU
MUST FOLLOW YOUR DREAM,

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.146
SO YOU CAN MAKE
THEM PROUD.

00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:48.848

CLEARING DISHES
