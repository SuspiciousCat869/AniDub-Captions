00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.678
IT'S THE SOURCE OF
THE NEGATIVE ENERGY

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.981
THAT CAUSED
THIS DARK SMOKE
TO APPEAR.

00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:55.782
AND IN A TWIST
OF FATE,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.852

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:13.861
AAAARGH...
I CAN HELP YOU!

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.996
HUH? OH YEAH?
HEY, THANKS KID!

00:09:23.637 --> 00:09:24.672
YEAH, THATTA BOY!

00:09:26.507 --> 00:09:28.275
AS FOR YOU, LADY...

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:30.344
DO YOU TREAT ALL YOUR
GUESTS THIS WAY?

00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:32.913
HASN'T BEING ACTIVE
AND HELPING SOMEONE ELSE

00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:35.916
TAKEN YOUR MIND OFF THINGS,
OFFICER TRUDGE?
EH?

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:38.285
THE BEST WAY TO DEAL
WITH A BROKEN HEART

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:40.421
IS TO STOP DWELLING,
GET OUTTA YOUR HEAD,

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:42.156
AND MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL.

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:43.691
YOU SEE, HERE IN SATELLITE,

00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:45.893
WE'VE HAD TO BECOME
VERY GOOD AT FINDING WAYS

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.761
TO COPE WITH
SADNESS AND LOSS.

00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.363
TAKE TAKA, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:53.233
WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER
HE LOST HIS HOME TO A FIRE.

00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:56.003
BUT HE WAS SO GRATEFUL
FOR THE SECURITY OFFICERS

00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:57.938
WHO DID EVERYTHING
THEY COULD TO HELP...

00:09:57.938 --> 00:10:00.074
HE NEVER FORGOT
THEIR KINDNESS.

00:10:00.074 --> 00:10:01.909
HE DECIDED HE WANTED
TO GROW UP

00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:04.912
AND BECOME A SECTOR
SECURITY OFFICER HIMSELF...

00:10:04.912 --> 00:10:06.847
THAT'S HOW HE DEALS
WITH HIS SADNESS--

00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:09.249
BY TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:13.287
SO THAT'S WHY HE KEEPS
FOLLOWING ME AROUND...

00:10:13.287 --> 00:10:15.389
BUT MARTHA--
THE RULES SAY THAT

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:16.790
PEOPLE FROM
THE SATELLITE SECTOR

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.692
CAN'T BECOME SECURITY.

00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:21.729
IN THIS CRAZY WORLD OF OURS,
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE...

00:10:21.729 --> 00:10:22.796
DON'T YOU THINK SO?

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:24.064
Taka: ONE DOWN!
HUH?

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.702
[THINKING] I HOPE SHE'S RIGHT
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED

00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:30.371
ALL THE SECURITY WE CAN GET.

00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:46.476
Taka, Jon, Mitch, Girls:
THIS LOOKS GREAT!

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:52.682
EH...YUCK!

00:10:52.682 --> 00:10:53.683
UH...

00:10:55.185 --> 00:10:56.920
THIS IS DELICIOUS,
ISN'T IT!?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.388
YEAH, IT'S AWESOME!

00:10:58.388 --> 00:11:00.623
THE COOL GUY FROM SECURITY
WHIPPED IT UP FOR US!

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:04.494
DOH! WELL, UH...

00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:06.796
THANKS, MISTER,
IT'S SO GOOD!

00:11:06.796 --> 00:11:08.498
YEAH, THANKS!

00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:10.400
HMPH!

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.871
EH...
[GULPING]

00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:16.272
IT'S TOO SPICY!...

00:11:16.272 --> 00:11:18.141
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:25.014 --> 00:11:28.117
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:11:28.117 --> 00:11:30.954
HEY KIDS, IF WE'RE ABLE
TO WIN THIS NEXT BATTLE...

00:11:30.954 --> 00:11:32.589
GOODWIN'S GONNA
FINISH THE BRIDGE

00:11:32.589 --> 00:11:36.492
THAT CONNECTS THE SATELLITE
TO NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:39.295
THAT BRIDGE WILL
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:41.831
IT'LL SIGNAL THE BEGINNING
OF A NEW ERA.

00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:44.167
WHERE YOU GUYS CAN GROW UP
TO BECOME ANYTHING.

00:11:49.806 --> 00:11:52.108
I SURE HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT!
[BOYS CHUCKLING]

00:11:52.108 --> 00:11:55.378
[THINKING] IF THEY WIN THIS WAR
AND SOCIETY DOES CHANGE,

00:11:55.378 --> 00:11:57.914
TAKA MIGHT BE ABLE
TO BECOME SECURITY...

00:11:57.914 --> 00:11:59.449
AND I MIGHT BE WORTHY OF HER...

00:11:59.449 --> 00:12:00.450
HM?

00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:03.920
[MUNCHING]

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.954
All: AAAAAH!!

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:06.055
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:08.191
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

00:12:08.191 --> 00:12:10.460
[ROMAN LAUGHS]

00:12:14.063 --> 00:12:15.865
WHO ARE YOU?

00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:18.334
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH US?
[LAUGHS]

00:12:21.237 --> 00:12:23.339
SORRY TO INTERRUPT
YOUR DINNER...

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:24.774
MY NAME IS ROMAN.

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:27.844
AND I BEAR THE MARK
OF THE SPIDER.

00:12:27.844 --> 00:12:29.579
Yusei: THE MARK
OF THE SPIDER...

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:32.248
JUST LIKE IN
THE VISION WE SAW...

00:12:32.248 --> 00:12:35.084
I HEARD THAT WE HAD
4 SIGNERS VISITING...

00:12:35.084 --> 00:12:36.920
I THOUGHT I'D
COME WELCOME YOU.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.489
OF COURSE--WE DARK SIGNERS

00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:42.191
HAVE ONLY ONE WAY
OF SAYING "HELLO."

00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:43.760
BRING IT ON, BUB!

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.895
NO!...WE CAN'T
DUEL HERE,

00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:47.297
IT'S NOT SAFE.

00:12:47.297 --> 00:12:50.300
EVERYONE'LL GET SWALLOWED UP
IF HE SUMMONS AN IMMORTAL.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.168
I'LL TRY TO LEAD HIM AWAY.

00:12:52.168 --> 00:12:53.870
YOU LOOK AFTER
MARTHA AND THE KIDS.

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:59.676
IF YOU WANT A DUEL
ROMAN--FOLLOW ME!

00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:01.110
LEAD THE WAY, FRIEND.

00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:09.052
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.355
HEY--DON'T LAG BEHIND.

00:13:14.057 --> 00:13:15.692
WE'RE COMING!...

00:13:15.692 --> 00:13:18.728
ALRIGHT, MEN--
THAT ROMAN IS A BAD GUY,

00:13:18.728 --> 00:13:20.897
HE TOOK CROW
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

00:13:20.897 --> 00:13:22.999
LET'S GO HELP
YUSEI DEFEAT HIM!

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:24.000
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:13:28.037 --> 00:13:30.306
COME ON--
IT'S TIME TO BEGIN.

00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:37.747
Both: LET'S DUEL!

00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:55.519
...IT'S TIME TO BEGIN.

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:00.357
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:07.064 --> 00:14:09.133
OH NO...

00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:10.968
[THINKING] IT LOOKS
LIKE THE ONLY WAY
OUT OF THIS

00:14:10.968 --> 00:14:13.270
IS IF YUSEI
CAN OUT DUEL
THIS DARK SIGNER.

00:14:15.473 --> 00:14:17.908
[LAUGHS]

00:14:17.908 --> 00:14:19.877
THE DUEL HAS STARTED.

00:14:19.877 --> 00:14:20.878
I'M SCARED...

00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:24.014
COME ON, EVERYONE, IN HERE.

00:14:25.683 --> 00:14:27.284
BUT TAKA'S
NOT WITH US...

00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:28.752
NEITHER ARE
JON AND MITCH.

00:14:28.752 --> 00:14:30.187
WHERE ARE THEY!?
[GASP]

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.891
LOOK!

00:14:36.193 --> 00:14:37.194
MARTHA!

00:14:37.194 --> 00:14:38.195
Trudge: I'M ON IT!

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.132
THE FIRST MOVE'S MINE--
I DRAW!

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.936
I SUMMON SHIELD WING
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:50.407
AND WITH THAT I END MY TURN.

00:14:50.407 --> 00:14:52.676
INTERESTING...
MY MOVE!

00:14:54.612 --> 00:14:58.015
I'M ACTIVATING THE SPIDER WEB
FIELD SPELL!

00:15:01.018 --> 00:15:02.152
THIS COULD GET STICKY.

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.655
YOU HAVE NO IDEA!

00:15:04.655 --> 00:15:08.759
NOW I ACTIVATE THE DARK TUNER
SPIDER COCOON!

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:11.328
AND THE REASON I'M ABLE
TO SUMMON THIS MONSTER

00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:13.130
IS BECAUSE MY FIELD IS EMPTY

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.599
AND YOU HAVE
ONE MONSTER IN PLAY!

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:18.669
WITH THAT DONE,
I'M SUMMONING DARK SPIDER!

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.374
NOW UNTIL THE END
OF MY TURN...

00:15:23.374 --> 00:15:24.909
DARK SPIDER CAN HARNESS

00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:27.011
THE POWER OF THE SHADOWS
IN ITS WEB

00:15:27.011 --> 00:15:31.348
AND GRANT THE POWER
TO AN INSECT MONSTER
ON MY FIELD.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:35.452
WHICH MEANS SPIDER COCOON'S
LEVEL GROWS IN POWER...

00:15:35.452 --> 00:15:38.289
AND NOW SPIDER COCOON
WILL RETURN THE FAVOR

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:40.858
BY GIVING DARK SPIDER
A TUNE-UP!

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.874
WHEN THE SHADOWS ARE DEVOURED
BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS,

00:15:56.874 --> 00:15:59.176
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS...

00:15:59.176 --> 00:16:01.645
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:16:01.645 --> 00:16:03.781
COME FORTH!

00:16:03.781 --> 00:16:06.517
UNDERGROUND ARACHNID!

00:16:07.685 --> 00:16:10.254
OH GREAT,
ANOTHER INSECT DUEL...

00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:12.489
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
SPIDER'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH

00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:14.158
TO CRAWL PAST
MY SHIELD WING.

00:16:16.894 --> 00:16:20.297
WHO SAYS THAT I WANT IT
TO CRAWL PAST ANYTHING YUSEI?

00:16:20.297 --> 00:16:23.567
I JUST PLAN ON TAKING YOUR
SHIELD WING FOR MY OWN!

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.135
GO TWINE THREAD!

00:16:31.842 --> 00:16:34.578
DOES THIS MEAN
SHIELD WING'S
ON YOUR FIELD?!

00:16:34.578 --> 00:16:36.747
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU SEE ONCE A TURN,

00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.649
UNDERGROUND ARACHNID
CAN USE

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:41.285
ONE OF THE MONSTERS ON YOUR
FIELD AS AN EQUIP CARD

00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:43.120
TO GAIN MORE POWER.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.456
AND NOW THAT YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO PROTECT YOU,

00:16:45.456 --> 00:16:47.324
UNDERGROUND ARACHNID
CAN ATTACK!

00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:55.766
OH NO,
THAT THING WIPED OUT

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.568
MORE THAN HALF
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:16:57.568 --> 00:16:59.236
THIS IS BAD...

00:16:59.236 --> 00:17:03.641
I'M PLACING ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND ENDING MY TURN.

00:17:03.641 --> 00:17:04.708
YOUR MOVE...

00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.413
LET'S GO UP HERE...
FOLLOW ME.

00:17:14.318 --> 00:17:16.120
IT'S MY TURN NOW...
I DRAW!

00:17:17.588 --> 00:17:20.624
I SUMMON THE TUNER MONSTER--
ROAD SYNCHRON!

00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:28.666
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE ONE FOR ONE SPELL CARD!

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:31.669
SO BY SENDING ONE MONSTER
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:33.270
I CAN USE ONE FOR ONE

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.539
TO SUMMON A WEAKER
MONSTER FROM MY HAND!

00:17:37.908 --> 00:17:39.643
NOT ONLY THAT--
BUT WHEN I HAVE

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:41.979
A FACEUP TUNER MONSTER
ON MY FIELD...

00:17:41.979 --> 00:17:44.248
I CAN INSTANTLY SUMMON
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

00:17:44.248 --> 00:17:45.449
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:47.351 --> 00:17:49.753
SO WITH THOSE 3 MONSTERS
ON HIS FIELD...

00:17:49.753 --> 00:17:53.090
I BET YUSEI'S GOT A PLAN
TO SQUASH THAT SPIDER.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.926
NEXT I ACTIVATE TUNING
SUPPORTER'S ABILITY!

00:17:55.926 --> 00:17:57.561
WHEN IT'S USED
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:17:57.561 --> 00:17:59.530
IT CAN ACT AS
A LEVEL 2 MONSTER.

00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:02.733
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN...

00:18:02.733 --> 00:18:04.568
THAT I'M TUNING
ROAD SYNCHRON

00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:07.371
WITH MY QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
AND TUNING SUPPORTER

00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:10.307
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO
SUMMON...ROAD FIGHTER!

00:18:15.946 --> 00:18:17.281
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:18:22.453 --> 00:18:24.488
Duel runner computer:
ROAD FIGHTER
IS A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:27.524
THAT LETS YOU SUMMON A LEVEL ONE
OR LEVEL TWO MONSTER

00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.194
FROM YOUR DECK ONCE PER TURN.

00:18:30.194 --> 00:18:32.329
3,000 ATTACK POINTS!

00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.998
NOW THAT'S
HOW WE SIGNERS
LIKE T' DO THINGS!

00:18:34.998 --> 00:18:36.033
HMPH!

00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:37.568
SINCE I USED
TUNING SUPPORTER

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:39.536
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON JUST NOW,

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.072
I CAN ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:18:42.072 --> 00:18:43.774
TIME TO BRAWL!

00:18:43.774 --> 00:18:47.344
ROAD FIGHTER CRUSH HIS
UNDERGROUND ARACHNID!

00:18:47.344 --> 00:18:49.146
GO LIGHTNING CLAW!

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:56.720
YOU DID IT!

00:19:03.627 --> 00:19:05.195
WHAT JUST HAPPENED??

00:19:05.195 --> 00:19:08.132
UNDERGROUND ARACHNID
USED YOUR SHIELD WING

00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:10.534
IN ORDER TO SAVE ITSELF
FROM YOUR ATTACK.

00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.202
AND NOW, DUE TO THE EFFECT

00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:14.371
OF THE SPIDER WEB
FIELD SPELL,

00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:17.141
ROAD FIGHTER IS FORCED
INTO DEFENSE MODE...

00:19:17.141 --> 00:19:19.777
AND IT'S STUCK THAT WAY
UNTIL YOUR NEXT TURN.

00:19:22.846 --> 00:19:24.848
IF UNDERGROUND
ARACHNID MANAGES

00:19:24.848 --> 00:19:27.651
TO WEAVE ITS WEB AROUND
YOUR MONSTER ON MY NEXT TURN,

00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:30.220
THEN YOUR FIELD
WILL BE EMPTY, YUSEI.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.189
AND WHEN YOU TAKE
MY DIRECT ATTACK,

00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:34.158
YOU WILL DANCE
THE DANCE OF DOOM.

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:38.595
THING IS?...I DON'T DANCE.

00:19:38.595 --> 00:19:41.465
I ACTIVATE
ROAD FIGHTER'S ABILITY!

00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:43.333
ONCE A TURN,
I CAN USE ITS POWER

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:46.136
TO SUMMON A LEVEL 1 OR 2
MONSTER FROM MY DECK!

00:19:49.973 --> 00:19:53.343
SO I'M SUMMONING--
TURBO BOOSTER!

00:19:53.343 --> 00:19:55.412
THIS ONE'S
FOR YOU, RALLY...

00:19:55.412 --> 00:19:58.282
NOW I ACTIVATE
TURBO BOOSTER'S ABILITY!

00:19:58.282 --> 00:19:59.917
BY RELEASING THIS CARD...

00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:02.920
I CAN POUND UNDERGROUND
ARACHNID INTO THE DIRT!

00:20:05.322 --> 00:20:07.624
GO--TWIN FISTS OF FURY!

00:20:13.697 --> 00:20:15.032
HE DID IT.

00:20:15.032 --> 00:20:17.534
THIS DARK SIGNER
HAS NOTHING ON YUSEI...

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:18.535
Jon: OVER THERE!

00:20:20.337 --> 00:20:22.139
HEY, YUSEI!

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:23.607
Yusei: NO!

00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:26.310
OH DEAR...WHAT ARE
THEY DOING HERE!?

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.812
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER,
DON'T TOUCH
THAT BARRIER...

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:29.880
EH?!

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.915
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR YOUR FRIENDS!

00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:34.751
I SUMMON ALTAR
OF THE BOUND DEITY!

00:20:34.751 --> 00:20:37.754
NOW ONCE A TURN DURING
MY STANDBY PHASE--

00:20:37.754 --> 00:20:40.390
FOR EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:44.428
THE ALTAR GAINS ONE
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL COUNTER.

00:20:44.428 --> 00:20:47.598
WHEN ALL 4 OF
THE ALTAR'S COUNTER FLAMES
HAVE BEEN LIT...

00:20:47.598 --> 00:20:49.700
THE BOUND DEITY
WILL GRANT ME THE POWER

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.070
TO SUMMON ONE EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL FROM MY DECK!

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.872
OH NO!

00:20:54.872 --> 00:20:57.674
EARTHBOUND IMMORTALS,
THOSE ARE
THE BIG ONES, RIGHT?

00:20:57.674 --> 00:20:59.843
THE ONES THAT ABSORB
THE ESSENCE OF ANYONE

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:02.779
THAT COMES IN CONTACT
WITH THAT PURPLE MIST?

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:04.648
THIS WAS A MISTAKE!

00:21:04.648 --> 00:21:06.183
Akiza: KIDS!...RUN!

00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:10.687
[THINKING] JON...
MITCH...TAKA...

00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:18.462
MAN...WHERE ARE THOSE GUYS?...

00:21:18.462 --> 00:21:20.664
I TOTALLY LOST 'EM...

00:21:20.664 --> 00:21:23.800
I SENSE A FEW MORE RATS
HAVE SNUCK IN...

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.636
THAT'S TOO BAD
FOR THEM SINCE

00:21:25.636 --> 00:21:27.938
THE ONLY WAY TO END
THIS DUEL AT THIS POINT...

00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:30.674
IS FOR ONE OF US
TO SUFFER DEFEAT.

00:21:30.674 --> 00:21:32.542
[THINKING] I CAN'T
LOSE THIS BATTLE,

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.244
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO STOP HIM

00:21:34.244 --> 00:21:36.780
BEFORE HE SUMMONS
AN EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL...

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.182
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I CAN SAVE THOSE KIDS.
