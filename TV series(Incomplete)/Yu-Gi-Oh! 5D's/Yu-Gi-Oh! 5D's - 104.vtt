00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.408
Man: MY GOODNESS,
LOOK AT THAT!

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:09.510
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.113
I SUMMON THE PHANTOM
BEAST WILD-HORN!

THE PAIN DOWN

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.601
Man: LOOK AT ALL
THOSE DUELISTS.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.337
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.540
Man: LET US HOPE IT
STAYS THAT WAY.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.775
WE NEED THEM TO
REMAIN IGNORANT,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.878
LIKE RATS RUNNING ON
THEIR LITTLE WHEELS.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.481
FOR THE WHEELS ON WHICH
THEY RUN POWER THE CIRCUIT.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.916
AND WHEN THE CIRCUIT
IS COMPLETE,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.884
THE FUTURE WILL BE OURS.

GREAT, THE OUTPUT
IS STABLE NOW.

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.191
LET'S TRY TO INCREASE

FRAGMENT GEAR.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.995

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.875
HOW ARE THEY, BREO?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.111
THEY'RE GONNA
BE OKAY.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.912
WHAT HAPPENED OUT
ON THE TRACK?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.080
I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.949
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.853
BUT HOW COULD THEY BOTH JUST
CRASH BACK TO BACK LIKE THAT?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.391
JEAN!

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:38.925
SORRY, GUYS,
BUT I GOTTA GO.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.460
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.762
HAS HE WOKEN UP YET,
HAS HE SAID ANYTHING?

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.296
Woman: PLEASE, SIR, I NEED
YOU TO STAND BACK.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.198
Crow: HEY GUYS, WHAT'S
FOR LUNCH?

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.668
YOU CAN HAVE RAMEN,
RAMEN, OR RAMEN.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.102
WHAT DID YOUR DOCTOR SAY?

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.537
GOOD NEWS?

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.507
YEAH, HE SAID I'M HEALED UP AND
GOOD TO GO AND READY TO RIDE.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:56.076
SEE, I DON'T EVEN--

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:58.145
I BELIEVED YOU FOR
ABOUT TWO SECONDS.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:02:59.546
WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE
JEAN AND THE OTHERS

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.014
AT THE HOSPITAL?

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.382
NOPE.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.084
THEY STILL CAN'T
HAVE ANY VISITORS.

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:06.219
I SEE.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.957
I WISH I HAD DONE MORE DURING
THE TEAM UNICORN DUEL.

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:13.026
ALL I WAS GOOD FOR WAS
BRINGING OUT STARDUST

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.429
AND PASSING THE
BATON TO YUSEI.

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.964
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.434
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
WICKET REBIRTH!

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:21.802
WHAT?

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.904
NOW BY PAYING 800
LIFE POINTS,

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:27.240
I CAN REVIVE A SYNCHRO
MONSTER FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.544
SO LONG AS ITS SPECIAL
ABILITY IS NEGATED.

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:34.648
SO COME FORTH
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.422
WE'RE FACING TEAM CATASTROPHE
IN OUR NEXT DUEL,

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.726
AND THEY DEFEATED
THE UNICORNS WITH EASE.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.662
THE GUYS HAVE PUT
THEIR FAITH IN ME.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:52.899
I'VE GOTTA STEP THINGS UP,
I HAVE TO GET BETTER.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.102
Man: ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
CONSPIRACY THEORIES?

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:57.404
DON'T YOU FIND IT STRANGE THAT
TWO DUELISTS CRASHED WHILE

00:03:57.404 --> 00:03:59.573
DUELING THE SAME TEAM
AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES?

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.575
HOW CAN YOU NOT CALL
FOUL PLAY ON THIS ONE?

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.144
THIS IS CLEARLY A CASE OF
SABOTAGE OR SOMETHING!

00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:06.847
HER VOICE DRIVES
ME CRAZY!

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.115
HMPH!

00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:09.950
I SUPPOSE YOU DO
HAVE A POINT.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.318
I'LL GET ALL WORKED
UP ABOUT IT

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:13.820
AS SOON AS
I FINISH MY COFFEE.

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:17.457

EVERY MEDIA OUTLET IN TOWN

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:29.136
PAPERS ARE CALLING US
THE TEAM TO KEEP AN EYE ON.

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:30.737
AND TO THINK, YOU
DIDN'T WANT ME TO TAKE

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:34.674
THIS CARD FROM OUR
NICE GUARDIAN ANGEL.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.177
A SHADOW CARD?

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:38.979
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.048
YOU'RE JUST GIVING
THIS TO US?

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.253
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, HERMAN?

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:48.054
THAT CREEP OVER
THERE HAPPENED.

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:49.689
HE APPEARED OUTTA THIN
AIR AND THEN MY WHEELS

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.358
JUST LOCKED UP
OR SOMETHING.

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:52.759
WHO IS HE?

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.294
DON'T YOU WANT
TO WIN DUELS?

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.762
DON'T YOU WANT
FORTUNE AND FAME

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.497
AND ALL THAT
COMES WITH IT?

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:58.999
THAT CARD IS YOUR
ONE-WAY TICKET

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.067
TO THE BIG
TIME, NICOLAS.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.872
IS THIS GUY
FOR REAL?

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.042
A SHADOW CARD.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:12.546
I GUESS I SHOULD
THANK YOU.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.081
SLOW DOWN, LET'S
THINK ABOUT THIS.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.784
SHADOW CARDS SOUND KINDA
DANGEROUS, DON'T THEY?

00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:19.386
WE BEEN GETTIN'
BETTER, NICKY.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:21.121
WE DON'T NEED TO
CHEAT TO GET AHEAD.

00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.223
BESIDES, I DON'T TRUST THIS
GUY, I MEAN LOOK AT HIM,

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.991
HE'S KINDA SKETCHY AND--

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.259
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.828
DID HE JUST
DISAPPEAR?

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:30.463
MAYBE HE WAS A GHOST
OR SOMETHING.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:33.800
GHOST OR NOT,
I'M SICK OF LOSING.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.502
I'M SICK OF
SCRAPING BY.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:38.538
I'M SICK OF THIS WORLD
TELLING ME NO!

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.207
A TICKET TO
THE BIG TIME?

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:41.908
THAT SOUNDS
GOOD TO ME.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.877
UNLESS YOU BOYS WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIVES

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.213
LIVING IN THIS
CITY'S SHADOW...

00:05:46.213 --> 00:05:47.514
WELL, NO.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.784
THEN WE'RE AGREED.

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:53.353
THIS CARD IS EVERYTHING
I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR,

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.356
AND MUCH, MUCH MORE...

00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.559
YES!

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.262
HEY, I SAVED UP TO
BUY THAT RADIO!

00:06:02.262 --> 00:06:06.900
THE BLACK ROSE IS ALL ALONE,
AND SHE'S ON HER DUEL RUNNER.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.468
COME ON, LET'S GO!

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:31.291
Jack: IT'S BREO.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.627
WONDER IF HE'S
LEARNED ANYTHING NEW.

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.331
IT SURE SEEMS LIKE IT.

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.799
HEY, WAIT FOR ME.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.668
HEY CARLY, YOU DIDN'T
PAY THE BILL!

00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.603
Carly: PUT IT ON MY TAB!

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.640
YOU DON'T
HAVE A TAB!

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.275
HUH, SO DUEL RUNNERS
HAVE CHIPS

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:50.377
THAT RECORD THEIR
OPERATIONAL DATA?

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:52.712
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO
BELIEVE THAT JEAN AND ANDRE

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.748
WOULD RANDOMLY CRASH
IN THE SAME DUEL,

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:56.316
SO I CHECKED
THE DATA CHIP.

00:06:56.316 --> 00:06:58.752
HERE'S JEAN'S RUNNER AT
THE TIME OF HIS ACCIDENT.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:00.387
NO WAY...

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.455
A SHARP DROP IN
ROTATIONAL VELOCITY.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.257
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN, EXACTLY?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.993
WELL, IT MEANS THAT ONE SECOND
HIS WHEELS WERE SPINNING

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:08.728
AND THE NEXT SECOND,
THEY WEREN'T.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.330
A SUDDEN UNEXPECTED
WHEEL LOCK

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.265
WOULD EXPLAIN HIS
LOSS OF CONTROL.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.868
BUT WHAT EXPLAINS THE SUDDEN
UNEXPECTED WHEEL LOCK?

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.237
I THINK TEAM CATASTROPHE'S
BEHIND THIS!

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:20.106
SO DO I, BUT HOW WOULD THEY'VE
CAUSED IT DURING THE DUEL?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.409
WE WOULD'VE
SEEN SOMETHING.

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.977
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, CROW?

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:25.879
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING,
WHEN MY RUNNER CRASHED,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.480
IT FELT LIKE MY
WHEELS JUST SUDDENLY

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.382
STOPPED SPINNING
FOR NO REASON.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:32.252
Yusei: SERIOUSLY?

00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:34.621
THIS IS YOUR OP DATA RIGHT AT
THE TIME OF YOUR ACCIDENT.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.990
Man: SAME INSTANT
DROP IN ROTATION.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.326
SO THIS MEANS THOSE JERKS
FROM TEAM CATASTROPHE

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.561
SABOTAGED MY RUNNER
AND MADE ME WRECK!

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.129
THOSE CHEATS!

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.798
REVENGE WILL BE MINE!

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.433
CROW, SLOW DOWN.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.134
WE DON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO KNOW FOR SURE

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.602
THAT THE GUYS FROM
TEAM CATASTROPHE

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:51.604
HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.740
IF THEY DO, HOW ARE
THEY DOING IT?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.576
HOW COULD THEY LOCK UP
A RUNNER'S WHEELS REMOTELY?

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.945
THEY DIDN'T HACK IN,
THAT WOULD BE IN THE DATA.

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:01.081
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
NO ONE WATCHING THE DUEL

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.882
SAW ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS,
I MEAN IF--

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:04.517
HEY, I TOOK VIDEO
FOOTAGE OF THE DUEL

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:06.553
BETWEEN TEAM UNICORN
AND TEAM CATASTROPHE.

00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:08.021
IT'S RIGHT HERE IN
MY BAG SOMEWHERE.

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.156
MAYBE WE SHOULD
LOOK AT IT.

00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:12.892
UH, WHAT IS IT?

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.729
DID-- DID I DO
SOMETHING WRONG?

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:18.765
CARLY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
US YOU HAD THIS FOOTAGE!

00:08:18.765 --> 00:08:19.766
I DID!

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:21.167
I TOLD YOU JUST NOW!

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.869
Man: THIS IS ANDRE DUELING
TEAM CATASTROPHE'S

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:25.939
NICOLAS RIGHT
BEFORE HIS WRECK...

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:32.645
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
HE JUST STARTED SWERVING.

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:36.316
LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:40.186
Man: GO BACK A FEW FRAMES, RIGHT
BEFORE HE STARTS TO WOBBLE.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.921
THAT'S GOOD.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.790
OKAY.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.493
SO HE'S GOING,
HE'S GOING...

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:48.528
AND HE'S OFF.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.063
Jack: STILL NOT SEEING
ANYTHING.

00:08:50.063 --> 00:08:52.399
Man: LET'S LOOK
AT JEAN'S CRASH.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.569
HERE WE GO.

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.673
SAME THING, HE JUST
STARTS LOSING CONTROL.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:03.243
HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS
WITHOUT BEING SEEN?

00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:05.645
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS MONSTER HE'S DUELING?

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:09.215
WAS ANDRE DUELING THE SAME
MONSTER WHEN HE CRASHED?

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.517
OKAY.

00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:12.118
THE NAME OF THAT MONSTER
IS HOOK THE HIDDEN KNIGHT.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.653
LET ME LOOK IT UP.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:17.424
LEVEL 4, 1,600 ATTACK POINTS,
0 DEFENSE POINTS AND...

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:19.459
YEP, ANDRE TRIED TO ATTACK
IT WITH UNICORN KNIGHT

00:09:19.459 --> 00:09:21.261
RIGHT BEFORE
HE CRASHED.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:23.163
LOOK...

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:25.598
JEAN'S CRASH WAS DURING
HIS OPPONENT'S TURN,

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.434
HERMAN ACTIVATED HOOK
THE HIDDEN KNIGHT'S

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:30.670
SPECIAL ABILITY
AND THEN, BAM.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.106
ANDRE'S WHEELS LOCK UP,
HE LOSES CONTROL.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.608
Yusei: YOU THINK IT'S
THIS MONSTER?

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.544
I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THAT
HOOK THE HIDDEN KNIGHT

00:09:37.544 --> 00:09:39.913
IS SOMEHOW
DOING SOMETHING.

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.382
YOU GUYS NEED TO BE CAREFUL
WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR RUNNERS.

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:43.950
THEY ALREADY
GOT TO CROW.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.720
THEY MAY TRY TO GET TO
SOMEONE ELSE ON THE TEAM.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.955
OH NO.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.590
ONE OF US ISN'T
HERE RIGHT NOW...

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.292
AKIZA'S IN DANGER!

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.994
♪♪

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.110
I SUMMON ROSE
TENTACLES!

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:18.818
WHY DIDN'T ITS
POWER ACTIVATE?

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:21.354
YA-HA!

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.962
TWO DOWN
AND TWO TO GO.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.997
LOSERS!

00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.805
YEAH, WE'RE FINE.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.607
Yusei: I JUST SPOKE
WITH AKIZA'S PARENTS.

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:44.377
SHE'S PRETTY BANGED UP,
BUT SHE'LL BE OKAY.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.678
SHE'S GONNA BE
OUT OF COMMISSION

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:47.547
FOR THE NEXT
DUEL, THOUGH.

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:49.048
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, BRUNO?

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.684
WERE YOU ABLE TO GET
HER RUNNER'S DATA?

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.286
IT'S THE SAME
AS THE OTHERS.

00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:55.688
HER WHEELS DEFINITELY
LOCKED UP ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.191
YEAH, I FIGURED.
THOSE PUNKS!

00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.359
CROW!

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:00.593
WAIT.

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.128
WAIT FOR WHAT, WE KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.429
LET'S GO CALL
'EM ON IT!

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.398
C'MON, HANG ON.

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:07.567
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
I'M ANGRY, TOO.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.903
BUT WE CAN'T
ACT IMPULSIVELY.

00:11:09.903 --> 00:11:11.604
WE'VE GOTTA SETTLE
THIS, YUSEI!

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:14.974
WE WILL SETTLE THIS,
DURING OUR TURBO DUEL.

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:20.413
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:23.082
BUT I'M GOING TO BE THE
ONE DOING THE SETTLING!

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.784
YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION.

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:27.253
I'M NOT JUST GONNA SIT BACK
WHILE A COUPLE OF LOWLIFES

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.122
RUN AROUND AND HURT
MY FRIENDS AND TRY

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.090
TO CHEAT THEIR
WAY TO THE TOP.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.228
AKIZA STOOD IN FOR ME SO NOW
I'M GONNA STAND UP FOR HER!

00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.864
THOSE THUGS HAVE MESSED
WITH THE WRONG TEAM!

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:54.581
GO, GO, LET'S GO!

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.915
GO, GO, LET'S GO!

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.784
WHAT-- THEY SABOTAGED
THEIR DUEL RUNNERS?

00:11:57.784 --> 00:12:00.353
WELL, WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW
HOW THEY'RE DOING IT,

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.989
BUT WE THINK IT'S
CONNECTED TO A MONSTER.

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:06.392
IT SOUNDS LIKE TEAM CATASTROPHE
MIGHT BE USING AN ILLEGAL CARD.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.361
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME THIS RIGHT AWAY?

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:09.862
IF THIS IS TRUE,
IT'S A VIOLATION

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.198
OF TOURNAMENT RULES
AND A CRIME!

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.933
I'M ORDERING
A DECK INSPECTION.

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:15.602
OFFICER, WAIT!

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:17.303
I KNOW HOW THIS'LL
SOUND, BUT CAN YOU WAIT

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:19.038
'TIL AFTER THE DUEL?

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:22.208
LET THE GUYS BE THE ONES
TO BRING CATASTROPHE DOWN.

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.978
THEY'RE AWARE OF THE RISK,
BUT IT'S A MATTER OF HONOR.

00:12:24.978 --> 00:12:27.180
I UNDERSTAND, BUT--
YOU CAN STEP
IN AS SOON AS

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.116
SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
BUT GIVE 'EM THE CHANCE!

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.552
FOR THE RECORD, I NEVER
HEARD THIS CONVERSATION.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:35.822
BUT, MINA!
SIT DOWN, BOYS.

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:37.957
THE DUEL'S
ABOUT TO START.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.527

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:08.281
DIDN'T WE TAKE

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:10.416
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE GOT BACK UP.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:11.984

ABOUT IT.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:15.254

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.661
DO YOU THINK TEAM 5D'S
KNOWS ABOUT THE SHADOW CARD?

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.063
Man: NO.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.664
THEY SENSE THAT
SOMETHING IS UP,

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.199
BUT THEY DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:02.368
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO
SHAKE THE GRASS A LITTLE.

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:05.571
ONCE THEY DO REALIZE
WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON,

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.940
IT WILL BE TOO LATE.

HERMAN IS GONNA CLIP
THAT CROW'S WINGS.

00:15:23.556 --> 00:15:26.159
A BETTER PERSON THAN ME
WOULD FEEL KINDA BAD LAYING

00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:28.528
INTO AN INJURED DUELIST.

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:31.230
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I'M NOT
A BETTER PERSON THAN ME.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.400
I'M ABOUT TO
TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.903
SHOULD CROW REALLY
BE DOING THIS?

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:39.071
HIS SHOULDER HASN'T
REALLY HEALED YET.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:42.575

DON'T WORRY LUNA,
HE'LL BE FINE!

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:51.784
IF THIS SERIES OF RECENT
CRASHES IS ANYTHING

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.586
MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE,

00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:58.224
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND,
ILLIASTER IS BEHIND IT.

THE NOSEBLEED SECTION!

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.867
I HAD A FEELING YOU WERE
UP TO SOMETHING, PRIMO.

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:09.936
SO WHAT'S THE SINISTER
PLOT THIS TIME?

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:11.304
WATCH AND SEE.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.606
YOU KNOW JAKOB'S GONNA
LOSE IT WHEN HE FINDS OUT

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:16.742
YOU WENT BEHIND HIS

00:16:16.742 --> 00:16:19.045
WHEN I'VE MANAGED TO COMPLETE

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.614

I WILL BE THE FAVORITE.

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:24.750

00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:43.763
THAT WAS NOT COOL!

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:44.864
SWEET!

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:46.599
NOW HERMAN GETS
TO GO FIRST!

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:51.304
Announcer: <i>AND IT'S TIME</i>
<i>FOR THE DUELING TO BEGIN!</i>

00:17:56.976 --> 00:17:59.111
SHOW ME WHAT
YOU GOT!

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.580
I INTEND TO, I SUMMON

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.848
HOOK THE HIDDEN KNIGHT
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.191
NEXT, I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.193
HE DIDN'T WASTE
ANY TIME--

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:15.595
THAT'S IT!

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:19.465
THAT'S THE MONSTER THAT MADE
THE OTHER DUELISTS CRASH!

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.803
YOU MAY'VE MANAGED TO
TAKE MY FRIENDS DOWN,

00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:25.771
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GETTIN' ME.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.040
NOT THIS TIME.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.476
ALL RIGHT, IT'S...

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.745
IT'S MY TURN!

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.280
FIRST UP I...

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.617
I SUMMON BLACKWING SIROCCO
THE DAWN IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:45.024
Computer voice: BLACKWING
SIROCCO THE DAWN IS
A LEVEL 5 WINGED BEAST-TYPE

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:49.862
MONSTER WITH 2,000 ATTACK
POINTS AND 900 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:18:49.862 --> 00:18:51.831
SIROCCO THE DAWN HAS WAY
MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:53.766
THAN THAT STUPID HOOK
THE HIDDEN KNIGHT!

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:55.501
Man: SIROCCO IS
A HIGH-LEVEL MONSTER,

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:58.104
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WITH MONSTERS ON HIS FIELD,

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:01.674
I CAN DIRECTLY SUMMON IT WITHOUT
HAVING TO MAKE ANY SACRIFICES!

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:03.275
HERE WE GO.

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:06.779
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT'S
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.614
SIROCCO THE DAWN
IS SOARING IN

00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:10.416
TO ATTACK HOOK
THE HIDDEN KNIGHT!

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:13.052
GO DARK WING SLASH!

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.857
C'MON CROW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:19:17.857 --> 00:19:20.426
THIS IS THE SAME
SITUATION ANDRE WAS IN.

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:21.827
IS EVERYONE
WATCHING CLOSELY?

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.995
YUP.

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:25.231
YEAH!

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:28.467
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO DO
A LOT BETTER THAN THAT!

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:31.137
I ACTIVATE HOOK THE HIDDEN
KNIGHT'S SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:31.137 --> 00:19:33.105
I ACTIVATE SHADOW HOOK!

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:34.807
WHEN HOOK THE HIDDEN KNIGHT
BECOMES THE TARGET

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.809
OF AN ATTACK WHILE
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:38.411
BOTH IT AND
THE ATTACKING MONSTER

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:41.213
ARE FORCED INTO
DEFENSE MODE!

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:47.119
Announcer: <i>OOH, HERMAN</i>
<i>JUST SHUT CROW'S ATTACK DOWN!</i>

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.355
THE BEST PART OF THIS SPECIAL
ABILITY IS THAT WHEN

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:51.857
HOOK THE HIDDEN KNIGHT
SWITCHES INTO DEFENSE MODE,

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.427
YOU GET KNOCKED WITH
800 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:56.128
HERE IT COMES!

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:01.333
I CAN'T SEE A THING!

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.270
OOH, IT LOOKS LIKE CROW
IS WAVERING OUT THERE.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.738
<i>HE'S LOSING CONTROL!</i>

00:20:05.738 --> 00:20:09.942
<i>IS THIS TEAM UNICORN</i>
<i>ALL OVER AGAIN?</i>

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.857
<i>HE'S HOLDING ON TO</i>
<i>HIS MOMENTUM, HE'S--</i>

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:27.460
<i>HE'S REGAINED</i>
<i>HIS BALANCE!</i>

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.230
LUCKY BREAK.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.499
I'LL GET THAT BIRDBRAIN
NEXT TIME.

00:20:33.499 --> 00:20:35.000
DID YOU JUST SEE
WHAT I SAW?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.202
SURE DID.

00:20:36.202 --> 00:20:38.637
SOMETHING APPEARED NEXT
TO HIS BACK WHEEL.

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.005
WHY DOES MY LENS
COVER ALWAYS

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.908
GET STUCK AT
THE WORST TIMES?

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.510
WHAT WAS THAT JUST NOW?

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.212
IT LOOKED LIKE...

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:50.516
THAT'S IT!

00:20:50.516 --> 00:20:51.784
IT'S HIDDEN
KNIGHT'S HOOK.

00:20:51.784 --> 00:20:53.152
I'M POSITIVE I SAW IT!

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:54.720
IT COULDN'T BE!
WAIT, HOW
COULD ITS HOOK

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.422
BE COMING UP OUT OF
THE GROUND LIKE THAT?

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:57.690
DON'T KNOW.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.924
BUT I KNOW
WHAT I SAW.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.459
THAT'S REALLY
FREAKY!

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:01.961
SO IT'S NOT
JUST A HOLOGRAM?

00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:03.929
IT'S LIKE REALLY
REAL, FOR REAL?

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.598
HOW'D HE MISS?

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.666
THAT PUNK JUST
LUCKED OUT IS ALL.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:11.504
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE!

00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:14.740
WHO ARE THESE GUYS THAT THEY'VE
GOT A POWER LIKE THAT?
