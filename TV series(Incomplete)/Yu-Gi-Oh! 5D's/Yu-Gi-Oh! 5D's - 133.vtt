Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH YU-GI-OH 5D'S.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:05.005
MC: HE DID IT!

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.274
JACK ATLAS HAS MANAGED
TO WIPE THE TRACK

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.643
WITH TWO OPPONENTS IN A ROW.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:12.713
LADIES AND GENTS, PRIMO HAS
PASSED THE BATON

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:17.050
TO TEAM NEW WORLD'S
LAST DUELIST,JAKOB.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.122
Jakob:(LAUGHING)
GAME TIME IS OVER.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:25.058
THE REAL BATTLE BEGINS NOW.

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.363
PREPARE TO FACE THE END OF
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:34.067
Jack: WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.537
THESE ARE THE RINGS THAT
MAKE DAMAGE REAL.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.007
I ACTIVATE GRAND CORE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.342
SINCE IT WAS DESTROYED
DUE TO A CARD EFFECT,

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:45.979
I CAN SUMMON
MEKLORD EMPEROR GRANEL!

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.685
BY DESTROYING INFINITE AURA,
I GAIN LIFE POINTS EQUAL

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.820
TO THE NUMBER OF COUNTERS
ON THE MACHINE,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.723
MULTIPLIED BY ONE HUNDRED.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:00.994
THEREFORE, I GAIN 8,000 MORE
LIFE POINT POINTS.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:05.032
AND NOW, DUE TO MEKLORD EMPEROR
GRANEL'S SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.768
ITS ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS
BECOME THE SAME AS

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:09.937
MY LIFE POINTS.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.005
Yusei: LESTER AND PRIMO WERE
JUST GATHERING COUNTERS

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.174
FOR INFINITE AURA, SO
THAT JAKOB COULD INCREASE

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:17.978
HIS LIFE POINTS, HIS ATTACK
POINTS, <i>AND</i> HIS DEFENSE POINTS.

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:22.049
MEKLORD EMPEROR GRANEL TAKE OUT
RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.485
GO FINAL BOMBARDMENT.

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:29.456
RED NOVA DRAGON.
NOOO..!

TEAM NEW WORLD HAS

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.106
MANIPULATED THE FIELD AND NOW
BATTLE DAMAGE IS REAL.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.808
JACK'S ALREADY
ON HIS WAY TO THE E.R.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.678
YOU'VE GOTTA STEP IN AND SHUT
THIS THING DOWN.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:59.112
Lazar: I CAN'T.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.449
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
ILLIASTER MIGHT RESPOND.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.918
THIS IS OUT OF MY HANDS, MINA.

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.388
WE HAVE TO TRUST YUSEI AND CROW.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.992
THE FATE OF THE WORLD IS
IN THEIR HANDS.

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.228
Leo: CROW-- STOP!

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:16.763
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED
TO JACK OUT THERE.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:17.998
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:19.599
Luna: LEO'S RIGHT.
DON'T GO OUT THERE.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.101

YOU GUYS.

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.470
NO WAY! YOU CAN'T
DUEL THAT GUY!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.838
I'VE GOTTA!

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:27.974
FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOTTA
DO IT FOR OUR FRIEND.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.711
Yusei:JACK!
Crow: YOU OKAY?

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.180
Jack: TAKE IT.
DON'T LET ME DOWN.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.718
THEN THERE'S THAT.

00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:39.486
THE ONLY WAY TO
MAKE THAT GO AWAY,

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:41.121
IS TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.756
Leo and Luna: OH.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.257
CHEER UP.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.127
IT WON'T BE THE END
OF THE WORLD IF I LOSE.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.629

HAPPENS IF YUSEI LOSES.

IS READY TO CONTINUE DUELING,

BUT THERE'S STILL
NO SIGN OF TEAM 5D'S.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.636
IS THIS A FORFEIT?

00:03:56.636 --> 00:03:59.539
THAT'S MY CUE.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.707

HERE COMES CROW!

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:04.077
LOOKS LIKE THIS DUEL
IS GOING TO CONTINUE.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:07.380
THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS
CAN CROW AVOID THE CRUEL FATE

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.751
THAT SENT HIS TEAMMATE
CRASHING INTO DEFEAT?

ARE YOU READY
FOR SOME CROW?

Jakob: I PRAISE YOU FOR
HAVING THE COURAGE TO FACE ME

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:37.010
AFTER BEARING WITNESS
TO GRANEL'S MIGHT.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.213
BUT YOUR COURAGE HAS LED YOU
INTO THE ARMS OF YOUR UNDOING.

Lester: THE "ARMS OF" WHAT?

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.351
JAKOB ALWAYS SOUNDS
SO STIFF AND AWKWARD

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.954
WHEN HE TRIES TO TRASH
TALK HIS OPPONENTS.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:51.158
Primo: YES, WELL, AS LONG AS HE
PUSHES THIS LOSER TO HIS LIMITS

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:54.494

CAN BE AS AWKWARD AS HE WANTS.

I'M KICKING THINGS OFF
WITH SPEED WORLD 2'S EFFECT.

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:47.013
BY REMOVING 10
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.517
I CAN DESTROY ONE
CARD ON THE FIELD.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.286
CROW JUST USED UP ALL OF
THE TEAM'S SPEED COUNTERS!

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.921
-IT'S FINE.
-HUH?

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.557
IT'S NOT LIKE HE CAN AFFORD
TO TAKE ANY CHANCES RIGHT NOW.

00:05:57.557 --> 00:06:00.961
SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR
MEKLORD EMPEROR GRANEL.

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.297
I WON'T BE SAYING
GOODBYE TO ANYTHING.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.298
WHAT?

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.534
I PLAY THE TRAP
INFINITY WALL.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.170
WHICH PREVENTS MY MEKLORD
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.573
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK I WOULD
NEGLECT TO HAVE COUNTERMEASURES

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:15.909
AGAINST SPEED
WORLD 2 IN PLACE?

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.512
WELL, YOU CAN'T BLAME A GUY
FOR TRYING THE DIRECT APPROACH.

00:06:19.512 --> 00:06:22.148
IN THAT CASE, I'M
SUMMONING THE TUNER MONSTER

BLACKWING STEAM THE CLOAKED
TO THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:32.826
AND NOW, SINCE BIRDS OF A
FEATHER LIKE TO FLOCK TOGETHER,

00:06:32.826 --> 00:06:35.395
I CAN SUMMON THIS CARD
FROM MY HAND AS WELL.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.198

NOW HE'S GOT A MONSTER
AND A TUNER ON HIS FIELD.

00:06:45.105 --> 00:06:47.607
IN THEORY, HE COULD
DO A SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:48.942
EXCEPT THAT--

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:51.011
THERE IS NO POINT
IN SYNCHRO SUMMONING

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:53.280
WHEN YOU'RE FACING
A MEKLORD EMPEROR.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.815
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, BUDDY.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:58.418

ABOUT SYNCHRO SUMMONING.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.186

A BLACKWING AND A
BLACKWING TUNER FROM PLAY.

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.837

THAT I REMOVED.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.976
AND EVEN THOUGH STEAM THE
CLOAKED HAS LEFT THE FIELD,

A STEAM TOKEN APPEARS
TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.581
THIS TOKEN WILL ONLY STICK
AROUND UNTIL MY END PHASE.

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.216

NOW LEMME
SEE HERE,

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.803
I THINK I'LL REMOVE BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER FROM PLAY.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:53.807

BUT SINCE AURORA GAINS ARMOR
MASTER'S SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.587
IT CAN'T BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE NOW,

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.789

Akiza: BUT SINCE IT ISN'T
A SYNCHRO, TECHNICALLY,

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.964

CAN'T USE ITS POWER
