WELL, AREN'T YOU SMART.

00:08:55.487 --> 00:08:56.755
ACCORDING TO
THE REPORTS,

00:08:56.755 --> 00:08:57.822
THEY WERE
THE FIRST PART

00:08:57.822 --> 00:08:58.823
OF THE SYSTEM
TO BREAK

00:08:58.823 --> 00:09:00.892
WHEN THE REACTOR
REACTED.

00:09:00.892 --> 00:09:03.228
DURING DEVELOPMENT,
EACH INDIVIDUAL
CONTROL UNIT

00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:08.667
WENT BY A CODE NAME...

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.669
IN THE QUECHUA LANGUAGE,
THEY MEAN

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:14.940
THE GIANT, THE LIZARD,
THE HUMMINGBIRD,
AND THE MONKEY.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.342
THOSE ARE THE NAZCA LINES
THAT DISAPPEARED!

00:09:17.342 --> 00:09:19.811
ISN'T THERE
A SPIDER, TOO
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:22.447
Mina: THE SPIDER IS URU...
WHICH WAS THE CODE NAME

00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:23.848
FOR THE REACTOR ITSELF.

00:09:23.848 --> 00:09:25.550
IN ORDER TO REVERSE
THE REACTOR AND STOP

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.986
THE FLOW OF NEGATIVE ENERGY,
YOU HAVE TO GO TO EACH

00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:30.822
OF THOSE CONTROL UNITS
AND TURN THEM ON.

00:09:30.822 --> 00:09:32.490
THAT ROMAN GUY IS
THE SPIDER, RIGHT?

00:09:32.524 --> 00:09:34.326
DOES THAT MEAN
HE'S THE BOSS?

00:09:34.326 --> 00:09:37.796
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED
TO TURN ON THESE CONTROL
UNIT THINGAMAJIGS?

00:09:37.796 --> 00:09:39.731
THE DRAGON CARDS
IN YOUR DECKS...

00:09:39.731 --> 00:09:41.666
THOSE WERE
THE CARDS USED

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:44.569
TO POWER UP EACH
OF THE CONTROL UNITS.

00:09:44.569 --> 00:09:46.771
SO, LUNA,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.342
THAT YOU GET ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON BACK
FROM DEVACK.

00:09:50.342 --> 00:09:51.876
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL OF THIS?

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:55.914
BECAUSE PROFESSOR FUDO
ENTRUSTED THOSE CARDS
TO DIRECTOR GOODWIN.

00:09:55.914 --> 00:09:57.849
MY FATHER HAD
THOSE CARDS?

00:09:57.849 --> 00:09:59.818
WOAH, HANG ON
A SEC.

00:09:59.818 --> 00:10:01.453
SO ROMAN WAS LYING
ABOUT MY FATHER

00:10:01.453 --> 00:10:03.221
LOOKING
THE OTHER WAY?

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.958
Mina: WHY DID PROFESSOR FUDO
HAVE ALL THE CONTROL CARDS?

00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.927
IS HE THE ONE WHO
SHUT DOWN THE UNITS

00:10:08.927 --> 00:10:11.363
AND CAUSED THE REACTOR
TO MALFUNCTION?

00:10:11.363 --> 00:10:13.598
NO. JUST
THE OPPOSITE.

00:10:13.598 --> 00:10:14.966
HE TRIED TO
SAVE THEM.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:16.868
HE DID EVERYTHING
HE COULD TO STOP

00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:18.937
THE REACTOR
FROM GOING WILD.

00:10:18.937 --> 00:10:21.306
DURING THOSE FINAL
MOMENTS, HE MANAGED

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:25.110
TO GET THE CARDS...
AND THEN HAND THEM
OFF TO ME.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.478
IS THAT ALL, MINA?

00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:28.813
DID GOODWIN SAY
ANYTHING ELSE
ABOUT MY FATHER?

00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:30.148
NO, THAT'S IT.

00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:32.317
HE JUST SAID THAT YOUR
FATHER GAVE HIM THE CARDS.

00:10:32.317 --> 00:10:34.319
SO IF GOODWIN HAD
THOSE CARDS,

00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:36.955
HOW DID EVERYONE ELSE
END UP WITH 'EM?

00:10:36.955 --> 00:10:38.990
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT I DECIDED TO

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.493
RELEASE THE CARDS
"INTO THE WILD."

00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:44.429
I WANTED TO TEST
THE POWERS OF DESTINY.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:46.831
I WANTED TO SEE IF
THEY WOULD TRAVEL
FROM DUELIST

00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.099
TO DUELIST.

00:10:48.099 --> 00:10:49.401
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:51.536
I FIGURED IF
DESTINY REALLY
WAS AT WORK,

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:53.538
THEN IT WOULD
EVENTUALLY PUT
THOSE CARDS

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:55.240
INTO THE HANDS
OF THE SIGNERS.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.542
AND SURE ENOUGH,
THE VERY CARDS USED

00:10:57.542 --> 00:10:59.944

THE ORIGINAL REACTOR'S
CONTROL UNITS

00:10:59.944 --> 00:11:01.680

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.815

THEM NOW?

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:08.887
JACK ATLAS,
YUSEI FUDO, AND AKIZA.

00:11:08.887 --> 00:11:11.589
DESTINY REALLY
IS GUIDING US.

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:13.491
THE SIGNERS WILL BE
THE ONES TO REVERSE

00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:15.326
THE FLOW
OF NEGATIVE ENERGY.

00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:16.961
THEY WILL GO
TO SATELLITE,

00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:22.834
AND THEY WILL BATTLE
THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:25.036
Jack: WELL, SINCE
GOODWIN SEEMS TO KNOW

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:27.572
SO MUCH ABOUT DESTINY,
HE MUST KNOW

00:11:27.572 --> 00:11:29.808
HOW THIS WHOLE THING
IS GONNA TURN OUT, RIGHT?

00:11:29.808 --> 00:11:31.076

THE FUTURE.

00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:34.446
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:36.648
BUT GOODWIN IS DONE
PLAYING HIS PART.

00:11:36.648 --> 00:11:38.583

BEEN PASSED.

ALL OF YOU.

00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:45.156
THE FATE OF THE WORLD HAS
BEEN PUT INTO YOUR HANDS.

00:11:47.225 --> 00:11:49.828
HERE'S THE LOCATION
OF THE FOUR CONTROL STATIONS...

00:11:49.828 --> 00:11:53.431

LIZARD, AND MONKEY.

00:11:57.902 --> 00:11:59.704

BE A HUGE WASTE
OF TIME.

00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:01.606

IS ONE-ON-ONE.

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:04.642

HAVE TO SPLIT UP
AND GO SOLO.

IS MORE OF GOODWIN'S

00:16:39.863 --> 00:16:41.131
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:42.599
IT'S LUNA, SHE'S GONE!

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:43.801
WHAT?!

00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:45.402
THAT BIG BRIGHT LIGHT
JUST NOW, I THINK IT

00:16:45.402 --> 00:16:46.937
TOOK HER AWAY.

00:16:46.937 --> 00:16:50.874
OH, RIGHT, LET ME GUESS,
SHE WAS TRANSPORTED TO
THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:16:50.874 --> 00:16:52.576
EXACTLY!
NUH-UH!!

00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:53.777
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

00:16:53.777 --> 00:16:55.679
IT IS SO!

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:57.781
SHE WASN'T BEAMED
ANYWHERE.

00:16:57.781 --> 00:16:59.049
COME ON, LET'S
LOOK FOR HER.

00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:00.084
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:01.452
HEY! LUNA!

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:04.254
MAN, GROWN-UPS
NEVER LISTEN.

00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:06.757
BUT IF SHE IS WANDERING
OUT HERE ALL ALONE,

00:17:06.757 --> 00:17:08.492
THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD.

00:17:08.492 --> 00:17:11.362
LUNA! WHERE ARE YOU?

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:13.731
LUNA! YOU'RE NOT
HERE, RIGHT?

00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.699
IF YOU ARE HERE,
SAY SOMETHING!

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:19.269
LUNA! YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:21.438
HEY LUNA COME OUT!

00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:24.041
LUNA!

00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:26.744
HEY! LUNA!

00:17:27.778 --> 00:17:32.683
WOAH!

00:17:32.683 --> 00:17:34.785
THAT THING'S PRETTY BIG.

00:17:37.254 --> 00:17:38.422
THERE IT IS.

00:17:38.455 --> 00:17:40.891
THE MARK OF THE MONKEY.

00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:42.693
THIS MUST BE
THE CONTROL UNIT THING

00:17:42.693 --> 00:17:45.195
MINA WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:47.664
HEY, DARK SIGNER MONKEY GUY,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

00:17:47.664 --> 00:17:49.333
HELLO! I'M READY TO DUEL.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:52.636
Devack: I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU, SIGNER.

00:18:03.147 --> 00:18:05.315
CHECK IT OUT...
THE MONKEY SYMBOL.

00:18:05.315 --> 00:18:07.284
LUNA'S DUEL MUST
BE STARTING.

00:18:09.386 --> 00:18:11.855
THE FINAL
ROUND HAS BEGUN.

00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:32.310
SO IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS MONKEY BARRIER.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.145
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE NOT A SIGNER,

00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:35.546
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:37.949
I'M HERE TO
DUEL YOU!

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:39.150
THAT IS IF YOU
THINK YOU'RE

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.019
STRONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE ME ON!

00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:43.387
LEO!

00:18:43.387 --> 00:18:45.523
IS THIS SOME
KIND OF JOKE?

00:18:45.523 --> 00:18:46.857
WHERE'S
THE LITTLE GIRL,

00:18:46.857 --> 00:18:48.292
WHY ISN'T SHE HERE?

00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:49.627
I TOLD HER TO COME.

00:18:49.627 --> 00:18:51.228
YEAH, WELL,
SHE'S BUSY!

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:53.898
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DUEL ME
INSTEAD, MISTER!

00:18:53.898 --> 00:18:56.000
I MAY NOT BE A SIGNER,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.235
THAT I CAN'T ROCK
A DECK.

00:18:58.235 --> 00:19:00.805
NOW COME ON. LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!

00:19:00.805 --> 00:19:02.773
I APPLAUD YOUR
ENTHUSIASM.

00:19:02.773 --> 00:19:04.141
I REALLY DO.

00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:05.776
BUT I AM AFRAID THAT
YOU SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE

00:19:05.776 --> 00:19:07.912
THE POWER
TO MATCH ME, BOY.

00:19:07.912 --> 00:19:09.613
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

00:19:09.613 --> 00:19:12.216
IF YOU INSIST
ON BEING DESTROYED,

00:19:12.216 --> 00:19:14.085
SO BE IT.

00:19:14.085 --> 00:19:15.987
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:21.892
LEO, GET OUTTA THERE,
DON'T BE A FOOL.

00:19:21.892 --> 00:19:24.061
HUH?

00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:25.162
YUSEI!

00:19:25.162 --> 00:19:26.797
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:29.367
I TURNED AROUND WHEN
I SAW THAT PILLAR
OF LIGHT.

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:30.534
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:19:30.534 --> 00:19:32.703
WELL, FIRST LUNA
DISAPPEARED TO
WHO KNOWS WHERE.

00:19:32.703 --> 00:19:34.171
SHE WHAT?

00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:37.375
SHE MUST'VE GONE TO
THE SPIRIT WORLD
FOR SOME REASON.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:40.911
GREAT, NOW YOU'RE BABBLING
ABOUT SPIRIT WORLDS
AND FAIRY TALES?

00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:43.147
IT'S NOT A FAIRY TALE,
IT'S REAL.

00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:46.217
LUNA MUST'VE GONE
TO RESCUE ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON.

00:19:46.217 --> 00:19:47.585
ANCIENT WHAT?!

00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:48.986
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER,
RIGHT NOW,

00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:50.921
WE GOTTA STOP
THIS DUEL.

00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:52.456
HEY, DEVACK!

00:19:52.456 --> 00:19:53.858
THAT KID'S NOT A SIGNER.

00:19:53.858 --> 00:19:55.126
YOU CAN'T DUEL HIM!

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:58.429
I WARNED HIM, AND ONCE
A SHADOW DUEL BEGINS...

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.131
IT CANNOT BE STOPPED.

00:20:00.131 --> 00:20:02.666
NOT UNTIL SOMEBODY
WINS, THAT IS.

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:03.901
ERR.

00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:06.170
LET'S GET THIS
BATTLE GOING.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.206
IT'S MY TURN!
I DRAW!

00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:10.307
AWESOME!

00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:12.410
I SUMMON
MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.045
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:20.117
WITH MORPHTRONIC
MAGNEN IN PLAY,

00:20:20.117 --> 00:20:23.320
YOU CAN'T ATTACK
ANY OTHER MONSTER
ON MY FIELD!

00:20:23.354 --> 00:20:26.957
NOW, I'M PLACING
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND ENDING MY TURN.

00:20:26.957 --> 00:20:28.559
[THINKING]
BY LAYING MY
MORPHTRANSITION

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:30.194
TRAP CARD
FACEDOWN...

00:20:30.194 --> 00:20:32.229
I CAN TRIGGER
ITS EFFECT AND
NEGATE ANY ATTACK

00:20:32.229 --> 00:20:34.565
MY MORPHTRONIC
MONSTERS MIGHT TAKE.

00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:36.000
AND THEN, IF I'M ABLE
TO SUMMON ANOTHER

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.369
MORPHTRONIC MAGNEN
ON MY NEXT TURN...

00:20:38.369 --> 00:20:39.637
I'LL CREATE
A MAGNETIC LOCK

00:20:39.637 --> 00:20:42.773
THAT'LL STOP HIM
FROM ATTACKING
COMPLETELY!

00:20:42.773 --> 00:20:44.308
LEO, STOP THIS!

00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:47.678
YOU GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO GET OUTTA THIS DUEL!

00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:49.580
NO WAY.
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.750
IF I DEFEAT DEVACK,
LUNA WON'T HAVE
TO DUEL HIM!

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.418
HEH HEH HEH.

00:20:54.418 --> 00:20:55.586
LEO...

00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:57.054
ALL WE CAN DO
NOW IS HOPE HE

00:20:57.054 --> 00:20:58.956
CAN BEAT THIS GUY.

00:21:06.764 --> 00:21:09.834
OHH. THE SPIRIT WORLD.
I MADE IT BACK.

00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:17.274
THAT LIGHT MUST HAVE
BROUGHT ME HERE.

00:21:17.274 --> 00:21:20.244
OH HEY, KURIBON.

00:21:20.244 --> 00:21:22.012
THE MOUNTAIN WHERE
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON

00:21:22.012 --> 00:21:24.315
WAS SEALED AWAY.

00:21:24.315 --> 00:21:28.052
WAS SHE THE ONE
SCREAMING OUT BEFORE?

00:21:28.052 --> 00:21:30.154
IT'S MY TURN, BOY.

00:21:30.154 --> 00:21:31.622
I DRAW!

00:21:31.622 --> 00:21:35.626
AND I SUMMON MAGICIAN APE
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:40.631
Computer: WHEN MAGICIAN APE
IS IN ATTACK MODE

00:21:40.631 --> 00:21:43.234
YOU CAN GAIN CONTROL OF ONE
OF YOUR OPPONENT'S MONSTERS

00:21:43.234 --> 00:21:46.437
BY SENDING ONE CARD IN
YOUR HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:21:46.437 --> 00:21:48.839
[THINKING]
I USUALLY HATE
MAGICAL PRIMATES.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:50.407
BUT SINCE THIS THING'S
TOO WEAK TO DESTROY

00:21:50.407 --> 00:21:53.010
MY MAGNEN, I DON'T
MIND IT TO MUCH.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.512
JUST AS LONG AS I
DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

00:21:54.512 --> 00:21:57.681
ABOUT ANY SPECIAL
ABILITIES OR ANYTHING.

00:21:57.681 --> 00:22:01.118
I NOW ACTIVATE MAGICIAN APE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:22:01.118 --> 00:22:02.520
WHICH MEANS THAT
ONCE A TURN,

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.488
IF I TAKE ONE CARD
FROM MY HAND

00:22:04.488 --> 00:22:06.123
AND SEND IT
TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:22:06.123 --> 00:22:10.661
MAGICIAN APE IS ABLE
TO TAKE CONTROL OF ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:17.501
AND WITH THAT OUT
OF THE WAY

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:20.738
MAGICIAN APE ATTACKS
YOU DIRECTLY!

00:22:22.139 --> 00:22:24.375
AAH! AAH!

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:25.876
LEO!
LEO!

00:22:25.876 --> 00:22:28.045
[SCREAMING]

00:22:31.482 --> 00:22:33.884
THAT SOUNDED LIKE
LEO JUST NOW.

00:22:33.884 --> 00:22:36.387
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S
DUELING DO YOU, KURIBON?

00:22:36.387 --> 00:22:39.156
MAN, THAT REALLY
SMARTED.

00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:42.026
THAT WAS WORSE THAN
WHEN I DUELED SAYER.

00:22:42.026 --> 00:22:45.262
NOW YOU KNOW THE TRUE POWER
OF A SHADOW DUEL.

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:47.131
DON'T WORRY.
I WILL TRY TO SEND YOU

00:22:47.131 --> 00:22:50.234
TO THE NETHERWORLD
WITH AS LITTLE PAIN
AS POSSIBLE.

00:22:50.234 --> 00:22:54.038
THAT IS THE ONLY MERCY
I CAN SPARE YOU.

00:22:54.038 --> 00:22:56.640
LUNA...
