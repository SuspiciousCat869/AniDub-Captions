DON'T HAVE "REAL"
CONVERSATIONS?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.555
THE CHALLENGE IN THIS DESIGN
IS GONNA BE STABILIZING

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:03.823

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.025

Yusei: RIGHT, BUT IF
YOU LOWER THE GPM...

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.105

BEST TRADE-OFF.

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:21.675
GOOD POINT.

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:23.476

MOMENTUM IN A DIFFERENT WAY

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:24.678

I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH, BRUNO.

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:45.699
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH
THIS SYSTEM FOR MONTHS NOW.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.401
MY CODING IDEAS ALL SPRANG
OUT OF YOUR STRUCTURE DESIGN.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:49.836
IT'S SOLID WORK.

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:52.172

YOUR FATHER'S SON...

ABOUT MY FATHER?

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.478
I'M NOT SURE...
I JUST KNOW.

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.880
YOUR FATHER DISCOVERED
PLANETARY PARTICLES, RIGHT?

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.184
AND THAT LED HIM TO THE
PLANETARY GEAR CONCEPT.

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:05.518
NOW THAT I
THINK ABOUT IT,

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:07.320

PART IS SO INTERCONNECTED...

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:32.812

WITHOUT THE OTHER IN PLACE.

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.980
