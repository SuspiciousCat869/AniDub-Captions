WEBVTT

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:02.870
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's!"

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.071
THANK YOU FOR
TAKING THE TIME

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:06.039
TO SEE ME, MR. FUDO.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.408
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I NEED YOU TO SAVE

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.010
MY DAUGHTER AKIZA.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.112
I PUSHED HER AWAY,
AND SHE JOINED

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.014
THAT ARCADIA
MOVEMENT.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.449
JACK THINKS THAT
YOU JUST NEED

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.817
TO DUEL HER AGAIN!

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.652
YOU ALL WANNA
DESTROY MY LIFE! AAH!

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.088
WELL I WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN!

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.322
[GROANING]

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.324
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO PROTECT

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.293
YOUR FAMILY AND PROVE
THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:27.728
TO HELP YOU!

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.162
SO THIS IS FOR YOU!

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.297
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.433
I AM THE BLACK ROSE,
AND I SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.737
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:37.804
AKIZA!

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.373
DAD, GET BACK.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.642
MY POWERS WON'T
LISTEN TO ME.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:42.910
AAH!

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.078
I DON'T WANT TO
DO THIS ANY MORE!

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.079
DADDY!

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.482
NO!

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:49.917
I DID IT.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:52.452
I WAS ABLE TO
CONTROL MY POWER.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.454
YUSEI, PLEASE.
FINISH THIS.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.223
I DON'T WANNA
FIGHT ANYMORE.

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.592
THE CURSE
OF THE BLACK ROSE
ENDS NOW!

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:03.196
STARDUST DRAGON TAKE
OUT AKIZA'S BEAST
WITH COSMIC FLARE!

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:09.202
YOU N' YOUR
PARENTS HAVE

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.871
A LOT OF CATCHING
UP TO DO.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.041
BUT WE SIGNERS
COULD REALLY USE
YOU AROUND, TOO.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.442
WILL YOU FIGHT
WITH US?

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.478
WILL YOU TAKE A STAND
ALONGSIDE YOUR FRIENDS?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.047
YOU GOT IT, YUSEI.

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:22.215
[THINKING]
I KNOW THAT TOGETHER,
WE CAN DEFEAT

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.052
THE DARK SIGNERS
AND SAVE OUR HOMES!

I DIDN'T SIGN

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.091
UGH!

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.893
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S NOT
IN ANY PAIN.

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.094
THE CHILD IS
ACTUALLY CREATING

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.796
THAT ELECTRO-STATIC
FORCE FIELD

00:02:42.796 --> 00:02:44.531
WITH HIS TELEKINETIC
ABILITIES.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.433
WE FOUND HIS FILE
IN THE ARCADIA
BUILDING.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:48.702
APPARENTLY, SAYER
WAS A MASTER
MANIPULATOR

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:49.936
WHO WOULD TAKE
IN DUELISTS

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.071
WITH POWERS
LIKE YOURS

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:52.239
AND DEPENDING
ON THEIR STRENGTH

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.841
THEY WOULD
EITHER STAY
OR DISAPPEAR.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.410
[THINKING]
COULD IT BE TRUE?!

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.645
WAS SAYER REALLY
DOING THAT TO PEOPLE?!

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.781
WAS MISTY
TELLING THE TRUTH?

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:02.282
I'VE WAITED
A LONG TIME
FOR THIS,

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.217
MISS WHATEVER
YOU CALL YOURSELF.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.420
I WANT
MY BROTHER BACK.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.521
YOUR BROTHER?!

00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.189
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM!

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.924
WHY DO YOU THINK I DO?

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.359
ENOUGH LIES!

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.363
I WANT ANSWERS
AND I WANT THEM NOW,
MISS AKIZA.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.397
YOUR GROUP
OF PSYCHICS--

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.400
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT--
STOLE HIM.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.369
[THINKING]
IF HE WAS RECRUITED,
THAT MEANS MISTY'S

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.673
BROTHER COULD BE ONE
OF THE ONES THAT VANISHED!

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:27.841
I'M SORRY, AKIZA.

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:29.176
I KNOW THIS HAS TO
COME AS A SHOCK

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:30.877
AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:33.680
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SAYER
WAS ONE OF THE BAD GUYS.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.882
THE TRUE PURPOSE
OF HIS ARCADIA MOVEMENT

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.085
WAS TO CREATE AN ARMY
OF PSYCHIC DUELISTS

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.754
HE COULD USE TO TRY
AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:42.322
YOU WERE JUST ANOTHER
SOLDIER THAT HE WAS

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:44.825
TRAINING FOR
THE BATTLEFIELD TO FIGHT.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.027
IT'S ALL HERE.

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.729
HE WAS USING YOU.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.669
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM THE TRUTH, AKIZA!

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.704
WE NEED YOUR HELP!

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.239
YOU HAVE THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON,

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.441
AND WE NEED YOU TO BEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.610
PLEASE COME BACK!

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.449
WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT HER, YUSEI!

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:15.455
[THINKING]
HOW COULD YOU
BETRAY ME, SAYER?

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.365
AKIZA.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:28.001
I CAN'T BE MAD
AT SAYER, YUSEI.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.771
HE OFFERED ME
A HOME WHEN
NO ONE ELSE

00:04:30.771 --> 00:04:32.405
WOULD TAKE ME IN.

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.707
SO, HE USED ME.

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:36.409
I GUESS I USED HIM
SO I COULD FEEL SAFE.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.613
NOW, HE'S VANISHED
AND DESPITE WHAT
HE'S DONE, I'M SAD.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.481
I'D BE WORRIED
IF YOU WEREN'T.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.549
HUH?

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:44.184
YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART.

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:46.620
THAT'S WHY WE ALL CAME
HERE TO HELP YOU OUT.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.256
IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL
THE "PSYCHIC POWERS" .

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.391
IT'S ABOUT WHO YOU
ARE AS A PERSON.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.959
THERE'S A GOODNESS,
A STRENGTH I FELT IN YOU

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.327
WHEN WE FIRST DUELED.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.030
THAT'S WHY I WANTED YOU
AS A FRIEND.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.266
A FRIEND.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.534
NOW LET'S FIND OUT
HOW TO TAKE

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:02.536
THESE DARK SIGNERS
OUT TOGETHER!

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:04.137
TOGETHER!

00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:34.190
WOWWWWW!

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.658
GOODWIN'S MANSION
IS HUGE!

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:38.628
IT'S PROBABLY GOT
ITS OWN ZIP CODE!

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:41.931
THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING.

00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:47.103
I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME
FOR THIS MOMENT:

00:05:47.103 --> 00:05:50.239
THE FOUR SIGNERS STANDING
HERE ALL TOGETHER!

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.241
IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR
THAT I WELCOME YOU

00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.576
ALL TO MY HOME.

00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:55.678
I'M HERE TO SERVE YOU.

00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:57.513
RIGHT. THE ONLY
THING YOU'VE EVER SERVED

00:05:57.513 --> 00:05:59.182
IS A TENNIS BALL.

00:05:59.182 --> 00:06:00.850
JACK IS RIGHT.
GOODWIN'S PLAYED US

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.719
SINCE THE VERY
BEGINNING!

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.287
I MEAN, HE'S THE ONE
WHO THREATENED

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:05.588
YOUR FRIENDS
IN THE SATELLITE

00:06:05.588 --> 00:06:06.789
JUST TO MAKE
YOU DUEL

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.224
IN THAT TOURNAMENT
TO SEE IF YOU

00:06:08.224 --> 00:06:09.625
WERE ACTUALLY
A SIGNER!

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.328
HOW COULD YOU EVER
TRUST A GUY LIKE THAT?!

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:13.596
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:15.698
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS

00:06:15.698 --> 00:06:17.567
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:19.402
AND WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S AT STAKE

00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:22.372
I CAN'T RISK NOT GIVING HIM
A SECOND CHANCE.

00:06:22.372 --> 00:06:24.340
IF GOODWIN'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO HAS A PLAN,

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.175
I HAVE TO TRUST HIM.

00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:27.877
WELL WHEN YOU PUT
IT LIKE THAT,

00:06:27.877 --> 00:06:29.846
YOU CAN COUNT ME IN.
OKAY?

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:32.315
GLAD TO KNOW THAT I
GOT YOUR SUPPORT.

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:33.850
SO WHY'D YOU
INVITE US HERE?

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.419
YOU GIVING US SUPER
DUELING DECKS, OR WHAT?!

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.256
I DON'T RECALL
ANYONE INVITING YOU.

00:06:40.256 --> 00:06:41.724
UH, I'LL TAKE
A RAIN CHECK

00:06:41.724 --> 00:06:43.426
ON THOSE DUELING DECKS.

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:46.195
THERE ARE NO
"SUPER DUELING DECKS."

00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:48.331
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO HOME NOW.

00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:50.900
HUH? OHH.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.535
SIGNER OR NOT,
HE'S MY BROTHER.

00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:53.603
HE STAYS!

00:06:53.603 --> 00:06:55.204
I DO?

00:06:57.707 --> 00:07:00.243
JUST NO PETS, OKAY?

00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:01.677
WE'LL BOTH
SAVE THE WORLD!

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:03.579
UM, ALRIGHT.

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:05.314
NOW THAT THE DAY CARE
ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN

00:07:05.314 --> 00:07:09.118
FINALIZED FOR LEO
SHALL WE GO INSIDE?

00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:20.563
WHERE ARE WE GOING,
MISTER GOODWIN?

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:22.465
TO A VERY SPECIAL
ROOM THAT HOLDS

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:24.534
THE ANSWERS YOU SEEK.

00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:26.235
LAST I WAS HERE,
I WAS LEFT

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:28.738
WITH MORE QUESTIONS
THAN ANSWERS.

00:07:28.738 --> 00:07:31.307
FUNNY. NICE TO KNOW
YOU DIDN'T LOSE
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR

00:07:31.307 --> 00:07:34.277
WHEN YOU LOST YOUR
TITLE MATCH, JACK.

00:07:43.252 --> 00:07:45.188
LOOK!

00:07:45.188 --> 00:07:47.256
Yusei: WHAT--WHAT
IS IT?!

00:07:47.256 --> 00:07:49.225
THIS, MY FRIENDS,
IS THE STAIRWAY

00:07:49.225 --> 00:07:51.594
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:57.533
WHAT'S THAT SHAPE?

00:07:57.533 --> 00:07:59.335
IT LOOKS LIKE ALL
OF OUR SIGNS!

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:02.271
THE CRIMSON DRAGON?

00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.406
CORRECT.

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:04.774
IT IS THE SYMBOL
THAT BINDS YOU ALL

00:08:04.774 --> 00:08:08.478
AND DEFINES YOU AS SIGNERS:
PROTECTORS OF THE WORLD!

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:14.283
YOUR ARM!
IT'S GLOWING!

00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:19.755
[GROWLS]

00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:21.557
LOOK FAMILIAR, JACK?

00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:23.693
ITS TIME OUR
BEASTS TUSSLE!

00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:26.562
STARDUST, ICE HIS
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:08:26.562 --> 00:08:28.898
GO COSMIC FLARE!

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:30.933
Yusei, voice-over:
JACK AND I HAD
A TURBO DUEL.

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:33.102
IT WAS AN EMPTY
STADIUM--
JUST OURSELVES,

00:08:33.102 --> 00:08:34.604
OUR RUNNERS,
AND OUR DECKS.

00:08:34.604 --> 00:08:37.406
AND THEN, WHEN OUR
DRAGONS ATTACKED
EACH OTHER,

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:39.142
SOMETHING APPEARED.

00:08:39.142 --> 00:08:41.444
Jack, voice-over:
NOT JUST "SOMETHING,"
IT WAS THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:08:41.444 --> 00:08:43.579
Yusei: WHAT IS THAT?

00:08:43.579 --> 00:08:46.215
Goodwin, voice-over:
EXACTLY. IT HAD CHOSEN
TO INSTILL ITS POWER

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:48.217
IN EACH OF YOU,
INFLUENCING YOUR LIVES

00:08:48.217 --> 00:08:50.820
UNTIL YOU ALL CAME
TOGETHER AT THIS TIME;

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.255
AT THIS PLACE.

00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:53.389
"INFLUENCING
OUR LIVES?"

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:54.423
WHADDYA MEAN?

00:08:54.423 --> 00:08:56.092
THE DRAGON HAS
SOME SORT OF CONTROL

00:08:56.092 --> 00:08:57.126
OVER ALL OF US?!

00:08:57.126 --> 00:08:58.761
NOBODY TELLS
ME WHAT TO DO!

00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:00.296
THIS IS MY LIFE, OKAY?

00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:02.498
I'M THE ONE
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, PAL!

00:09:02.498 --> 00:09:04.867
THEN YOU THINK THIS
IS ALL A COINCIDENCE?

00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:06.702
LEAVING THE SATELLITE,
FINDING YUSEI,

00:09:06.702 --> 00:09:08.104
AND MEETING THE OTHERS?

00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:09.605
IN YOUR HEARTS YOU'VE
EACH KNOWN THAT YOU'RE

00:09:09.605 --> 00:09:12.208
DESTINED FOR SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN A NORMAL LIFE--

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:14.110
THAT'S THE DRAGON SPIRIT,
GUIDING YOU.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.311
BUT WHY ALL OF US?

00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:17.713
SURE, I KNOW WE'RE
GOOD WITH A DECK.

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:20.650
THIS GOES FAR BEYOND
YOUR SKILLS AS A DUELIST.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.852
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
SENSED THE STRENGTH

00:09:22.852 --> 00:09:24.720
IN YOUR HEARTS
AND CHOSE THE FOUR OF YOU

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.256
TO TAKE ON
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:31.194
THIS HAS ALWAYS
BEEN YOUR DESTINY!

00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:32.728
IS HE TELLING
THE TRUTH?

00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:35.264
MY DESTINY?

00:09:35.264 --> 00:09:38.201
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS
A MONSTER, A WITCH.

00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:40.436
WHAT KIND OF HERO AM
I SUPPOSED TO BE?!

00:09:40.436 --> 00:09:42.338
I'VE HURT EVERYTHING
I'VE CARED ABOUT:

00:09:42.338 --> 00:09:45.441
MY FAMILY, MY SCHOOL,
EVEN SAYER.

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:46.742
Goodwin: I SENSE
YOUR DOUBT, AKIZA.

00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:49.612
BUT IT WAS THAT VERY POWER
THAT BROUGHT YOU TO US.

00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:52.248
WOULD YUSEI AND LUNA
EVER HAVE FOUND YOU

00:09:52.248 --> 00:09:54.116
IF NOT FOR THE LEGENDS
OF THE BLACK ROSE?

00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:56.419
THE CRIMSON DRAGON HAS
CHOSEN YOU NOT DESPITE

00:09:56.419 --> 00:09:58.721
WHO YOU ARE,
BUT BECAUSE OF IT.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:10:01.190
I FEAR THIS FINAL BATTLE
MAY REQUIRE ABILITIES

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.491
SUCH AS YOURS.

00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:04.527
EACH OF YOU FILL
A UNIQUE NEED

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:07.496
IN THE MOSAIC
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON'S
DUELING STRATEGY.

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:09.432
INCLUDING THE
SMALLEST OF US.

00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:11.500
THAT'S YOU, DEAR LUNA.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.337
TELL US ABOUT
YOUR SPECIAL GIFT?

00:10:14.337 --> 00:10:16.239
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF IT'S A GIFT.

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:18.374
I MEAN, I DIDN'T GET
IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY
OR ANYTHING,

00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:19.775
BUT SOMETIMES,
WHEN I DUEL,

00:10:19.775 --> 00:10:22.144
I GET TRANSPORTED
TO A STRANGE LAND.

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:23.746
IT'S SOME SORT
OF SPIRIT WORLD,

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:26.148
WHERE ALL
THE DUEL MONSTERS
ARE REAL.

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:27.483
WE'D PLAY AND
LAUGH AND--

00:10:27.483 --> 00:10:28.618
Leo: BOOORING.

00:10:28.618 --> 00:10:30.620
HEY! THIS IS
MY STORY!

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.856
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHERE
I MET ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON.

00:10:33.856 --> 00:10:35.925
SHE WAS IN CHARGE,
LIKE THE HEAD
SPIRIT, I GUESS.

00:10:35.925 --> 00:10:38.261
SHE SAID THAT
THE SPIRIT WORLD
IS IN TROUBLE

00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:39.762
AND I WAS THE ONE
WHO HAD TO RESCUE IT

00:10:39.762 --> 00:10:42.531
OR ALL THE OTHER
LITTLE DUEL SPIRITS
WOULD BE DESTROYED!!

00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:43.866
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
IT THEN,

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:45.768
BUT ANCIENT
FAIRY DRAGON
MUST'VE BEEN ONE

00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:47.436
OF THE DUEL MONSTERS
WHO FOUGHT

00:10:47.436 --> 00:10:48.671
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS!

00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:49.905
SHE'S PART
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.841
AND SHE CHOSE
ME TO HELP!

00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:54.610
OHH!
HA HA HA!

00:10:56.245 --> 00:10:57.313
YOU SEE?

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:58.848
YOU ALL HAVE GIFTS.

00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:02.151
JACK'N YUSEI WERE EVEN ABLE
TO GLIMPSE INTO THE PAST.

00:11:02.151 --> 00:11:04.153
THEY SHOWED YOU
THE PEOPLE OF THE STARS,

00:11:04.153 --> 00:11:06.555
AND THE DANGER THAT
AWAITS US ALL.

00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:09.158
SATELLITE OR CITY,
PRO OR AMATEUR,

00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:11.594
ALL OF US ARE
ON THE SAME SIDE NOW:

00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:13.462
THE SIDE OF LIGHT, OF LIFE,

00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:15.431
THE SIDE
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:17.867
IT WAS THE SPIRIT OF HUMANITY
THAT CALLED YOU HERE,

00:11:17.867 --> 00:11:20.803
HOPING YOU CAN STOP
THE END OF THE WORLD.

00:11:20.803 --> 00:11:23.572
AND ALL THIS TIME,
I JUST WANTED IT GONE.

00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:25.141
SO WHAT DO WE
DO NOW?

00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:27.276
WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

00:11:27.276 --> 00:11:29.445
[ROARING]

00:11:32.848 --> 00:11:34.417
THE GLOW'S GONE.

00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:37.420
UM, MISTER GOODWIN?

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.688
I KNOW I'M NOT A SIGNER,
BUT AREN'T THERE

00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:40.556
SUPPOSED TO BE FIVE
O'YOU?

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.325
SO WHEN'S THE LAST
CHOSEN ONE GONNA SHOW?

00:11:42.325 --> 00:11:45.861
YEAH LEO'S RIGHT.
WHAT DESTINY'S 80%?

00:11:45.861 --> 00:11:48.464
I PROMISE THE FIFTH SIGNER
IS READY TO JOIN OUR FIGHT.

00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:50.199
FOR SAFETY REASONS,
I'M FORCED TO KEEP

00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:52.168
THEIR IDENTITY A SECRET.

00:11:52.168 --> 00:11:54.136
BUT KNOW THAT WHEN YOU
FACE TRUE DANGER,

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:56.172
THEY WILL APPEAR ALONG
WITH THE FULL POWER

00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:58.374
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:12:14.252 --> 00:12:16.075
Yusei:
SO WE'RE ALL HERE.

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:18.411
WHADDA WE DO NOW?

00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:21.014
FIRST, A HIST'RY LESSON.

00:12:21.014 --> 00:12:23.883
NOW FOR THOSE
OF YOU HEARING THIS
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:12:23.883 --> 00:12:26.853
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
A HUGE WAR WAS FOUGHT,

00:12:26.853 --> 00:12:29.956
AND THE CRIMSON DRAGON DEFEATED
THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:32.191
AFRAID THAT THE SHADOWS
WOULD ONE DAY RETURN

00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:34.327
TO DESTROY THE WORLD,
THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:36.029
LOCKED THEM UNDERGROUND.

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:38.131
MAGIC SYMBOLS WERE
CARVED INTO THE EARTH,

00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:40.133
TRAPPING THEIR
ESSENCE FOR MILLENNIA.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:41.901
IN TIME, THE SHADOWS
WERE FORGOTTEN

00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:44.470
AND THEIR PRISON BECAME
A TOURIST DESTINATION.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.173
BUT THEY WEREN'T WILLING
TO STAY DEFEATED.

00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:49.976
THEY WANTED REVENGE.

00:12:49.976 --> 00:12:52.912
MANY YEARS AGO,
THE ORIGINAL ENER-D REACTOR

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:55.882
EXPLODED AND RELEASED
A SURGE OF NEGATIVE ENERGY

00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:57.850
THAT CRACKED
THEIR MAGIC PRISON.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.919
THE DARK POWER
OF THE SHADOWS HAVE BEEN

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:02.889
SEEPING INTO OUR WORLD,
INFECTING IT.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:04.957
UM, WHADDYA MEAN
"INFECTING?"

00:13:04.957 --> 00:13:07.193
FINDING "HOSTS" TO DO
THEIR EVIL BIDDING:

00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:09.429
THE DARK SIGNERS HAVE BEEN
USING SHADOW DRONES

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:10.897
TO SCOUT YOUR ABILITIES.

00:13:10.897 --> 00:13:13.266
AND THEIR GOAL IS AS
SIMPLE AS IT IS CRUEL:

00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:15.068
THEY WANT TO SEND
YOU SIGNERS

00:13:15.068 --> 00:13:16.903
TO THE NETHERWORLD
SO YOU CAN'T SUMMON

00:13:16.903 --> 00:13:20.006
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
WHEN THE SHADOW ARMY RISES.

00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:23.376
THEY USE MAGIC TO CREATE
AN INESCAPABLE DUEL FIELD,

00:13:23.376 --> 00:13:25.845
WHERE ALL THE DAMAGE IS REAL.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:27.380
Yusei: AND YOU SHOULD
SEE THEIR CARDS.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.982
THEY DUEL WITH A DARK
DECK OR SOMETHING.

00:13:29.982 --> 00:13:32.985
WHEN THE SHADOWS ARE
DEVOURED BY EVEN
DARKER SHADOWS,

00:13:32.985 --> 00:13:37.857
THE CURTAIN PULLS BACK
AND REVEALS A WORLD
WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:13:37.857 --> 00:13:42.328
COME FORTH,
FROZEN FITZGERALD!

00:13:42.328 --> 00:13:44.130
I'VE SEEN MORE
THAN ONE UP CLOSE,

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.933
AND SO FAR INSTEAD OF
USING A NORMAL MONSTER,

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:48.901
EACH ONE COMBO'D
WITH A DARK TUNER.

00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:50.536
THEY MUST SUMMON
'EM WITH THAT
NEGATIVE ENERGY

00:13:50.536 --> 00:13:52.505
GOODWIN
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:54.974
YES. THEY THRIVE
ON NEGATIVE EMOTIONS

00:13:54.974 --> 00:13:56.943
WHICH IS WHY THEY APPEARED
IN THE SATELLITE.

00:13:56.943 --> 00:13:59.312
THEY WERE DRAWN
TO THE DESPAIR OF THE SLUMS

00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:01.814
LIKE A MOTH
TO A BRIGHT FLAME.

00:14:01.814 --> 00:14:04.317
THEN WHY DID THEY COME
TO NEW DOMINO CITY?

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:07.019
IN THEORY, SAYER'S EVIL
PLOT TO CREATE AN ARMY

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.188
OF PSYCHIC DUELISTS IS
WHAT FIRST ATTRACTED

00:14:09.188 --> 00:14:10.590
THE DARK SIGNERS.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.492
UNFORTUNATELY NOW,
WITH THE DESTRUCTION

00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:14.927
AND INNOCENT PEOPLE
VANISHING FROM THE STREETS,

00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:17.396
THE CITY IS CLOAKED
IN A SHADOW OF DESPAIR.

00:14:17.396 --> 00:14:18.931
WHICH MEANS,
THE DARK SIGNERS

00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:21.467
GET EVEN MORE POWER
DON'T THEY?

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:22.935
I'M AFRAID SO.

00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:24.871
THE MORE PEOPLE
WHO LOSE HOPE

00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:26.105
AND WHO BECOME DEPRESSED,

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:28.774
THE STRONGER
THE DARK SIGNERS BECOME.

00:14:28.774 --> 00:14:30.977
THEIR BEASTS REQUIRE
THIS DARK ENERGY

00:14:30.977 --> 00:14:33.446
AND ONCE THERE IS ENOUGH
THESE POWERFUL CREATURES

00:14:33.446 --> 00:14:36.516
ABSORB IT SO THAT THEY
MAY BECOME WHOLE.

00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:43.055
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:45.324
ARE THEY ALL
GONE FOR GOOD?!

00:14:46.926 --> 00:14:49.095
UNTIL THE ARMY
OF SHADOWS IS DEFEATED,

00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:50.897
THEY'RE LOST,
GIVING MORE POWER

00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:52.832
TO OUR ENEMIES OUT THERE.

00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:55.168
AND NOW, ALL
OF NEW DOMINO CITY

00:14:55.168 --> 00:14:57.770
HAS BECOME A BATTLEFIELD,
EVERY INNOCENT PERSON

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.872
A POTENTIAL VICTIM.

00:14:59.872 --> 00:15:01.841
THOSE POOR PEOPLE!

00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:03.075
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:15:03.075 --> 00:15:04.277
LOOK UP THERE!

00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:06.445
Goodwin: AND OUR CITY
IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:15:06.445 --> 00:15:09.048
IF WE FAIL TO DEFEAT
THE DARK SIGNERS,

00:15:09.048 --> 00:15:11.584
TO STOP THE ARMY OF SHADOWS
FROM AWAKENING,

00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:14.287
THE SOULS OF THE PLANET
WILL FALL INTO DARKNESS

00:15:14.287 --> 00:15:18.291
WITH NO ONE LEFT
TO SAVE THEM.

00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:19.392
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:15:19.392 --> 00:15:20.826
THEY HAVE ANOTHER WEAPON,

00:15:20.826 --> 00:15:23.429
PERHAPS THE MOST
FRIGHTENING OF ALL!

00:15:37.282 --> 00:15:38.316
Goodwin: I BELIEVE
SOME OF YOU HERE

00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:39.784
HAVE EXPERIENCED
THE DARK SIGNERS'

00:15:39.784 --> 00:15:42.720
DANGEROUS AND POWERFUL
ABILITIES FIRST HAND.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.955
THEY ARE FORMIDABLE FOES

00:15:43.955 --> 00:15:46.124
WHO CONTROL
THE MIGHTIEST OF BEASTS.

00:15:46.124 --> 00:15:48.426
AAH!

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:50.762
YOU MUST MEAN
THE EARTHBOUND
IMMORTALS!

00:15:50.762 --> 00:15:53.131
YES. THEIR STRENGTH
IS STAGGERING

00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:55.033
FOR THEY CONTAIN
THE VERY POWER

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.769
OF THE ARMY OF SHADOWS.

00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:59.737
WE GET IT!
THEY'RE BAD OKAY?

00:15:59.737 --> 00:16:01.306
LET'S JUST TAKE 'EM OUT!

00:16:01.306 --> 00:16:03.975
YOU MUST LEARN TO
CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS,

00:16:03.975 --> 00:16:06.144
LEST YOU BECOME
ONE OF THE TAKEN.

00:16:06.144 --> 00:16:07.712
ERR.

00:16:07.712 --> 00:16:08.847
THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE RECRUITED

00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:11.249
BY THE DARK SIGNERS--
LIKE YOUR FRIEND CARLY,

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:13.885
WHO MOST LIKELY NOW DUELS
FOR THE FORCES OF EVIL--

00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.887
MAY STILL BE ABLE
TO BE SAVED.

00:16:15.887 --> 00:16:18.790
OUR TASK GOES FAR
BEYOND BEATING AN ENEMY.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.159
IT'S A RESCUE OPERATION
FOR ALL THOSE POOR PEOPLE

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:23.361
WHO'VE BEEN CORRUPTED
BY THE POWERS OF DARKNESS,

00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:26.064
AND WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP
THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM.

00:16:26.064 --> 00:16:28.766
JACK, YOU AND YUSEI
SAW THE FUTURE:

00:16:28.766 --> 00:16:31.336
A WORLD OF ASH AND SHADOW,
EVERYONE HAVING BEEN

00:16:31.336 --> 00:16:34.739
ABSORBED INTO
THE EARTHBOUND IMMORTALS.

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:36.708
WHEN YOU SAY
"EVERYONE ABSORBED,"

00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:38.676
YOU DON'T MEAN
EVERYONE?

00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:40.411
LIKE ALL OUR
FRIENDS AND FAMILY?!

00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:42.680
NO MORE PRESENTS
OR BIRTHDAYS?!

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.748
IF THAT HELPS.

00:16:43.748 --> 00:16:45.116
I ASSUME THAT
FOR THE REST OF YOU

00:16:45.116 --> 00:16:47.652
WHO ARE ACTUALLY SIGNERS,
THE FATE OF THE WORLD

00:16:47.652 --> 00:16:49.687
AND FUTURE OF OUR
CIVILIZATION IS

00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:51.156
A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT.

00:16:51.156 --> 00:16:53.191
YOU MUST EACH
MAKE YOUR CHOICE.

00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:56.694
I'M AFRAID THAT I CAN
ONLY TAKE YOU THIS FAR
ON THE PATH.

00:16:56.694 --> 00:16:58.696
AFTER TODAY THERE
IS NO TURNING BACK.

00:16:58.696 --> 00:17:00.698
YOU WILL HAVE TO
COMMIT YOUR LIFE, BODY,

00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:02.734
AND SOUL AS A SIGNER.

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:04.035
Akiza, thinking:
CAN I DO THAT?

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:05.937
CAN I COMMIT TO SAVING
THE SAME PEOPLE

00:17:05.937 --> 00:17:07.705
WHO SAID I WAS
A MONSTER?

00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:11.109
I THINK I CAN,
I OWE IT TO
MY FRIENDS.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.044
LISTEN. YOU N' YOUR
PARENTS HAVE

00:17:13.044 --> 00:17:14.879
A LOT OF CATCHING
UP TO DO.

00:17:14.879 --> 00:17:18.650
BUT WE SIGNERS
COULD REALLY USE
YOU AROUND, TOO.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.219
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WILL YOU FIGHT
WITH US?

00:17:21.219 --> 00:17:25.056
WILL YOU TAKE A STAND
ALONGSIDE YOUR FRIENDS?

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:29.827
YOU GOT IT, YUSEI.

00:17:29.827 --> 00:17:32.363
[THINKING]
YUSEI TAUGHT ME
NOT TO BE AFRAID,

00:17:32.363 --> 00:17:34.299
AND I'LL NEVER
FORGET THAT.

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:35.800
Jack: I'VE HEARD
ENOUGH!

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.968
JACK.

00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:39.938
JUST LET ME GO
AFTER THESE
DARK SIGNERS MYSELF!

00:17:39.938 --> 00:17:41.773
[THINKING]
I WANTED TO DO
IT ON MY OWN TOO

00:17:41.773 --> 00:17:44.809
UNTIL MARTHA TALKED SOME
SENSE INTO ME.

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:47.212
I HOPE AT LEAST YOU
WON YOUR LITTLE GAME.

00:17:47.212 --> 00:17:48.680
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU THINK!

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.316
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT
THERE THAT WANT TO
DESTROY OUR HOME!

00:17:51.316 --> 00:17:52.784
I BELIEVE YOU.

00:17:52.784 --> 00:17:54.752
BUT IF WE'RE
"ALL IN GREAT DANGER,"

00:17:54.752 --> 00:17:57.155
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE
US ALL ON YOUR OWN?

00:17:57.155 --> 00:17:58.289
IT'S MY JOB.

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:00.091
YOU'LL JUST NEVER
CHANGE.

00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:01.893
TRYING TO
DO EVERYTHING
BY YOURSELF

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:03.828
AND ENDING UP
IN A HOSPITAL BED.

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:07.165
YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS
OUT THERE THAT WILL
FOLLOW YOU ANYWHERE.

00:18:07.165 --> 00:18:08.666
MARTHA WAS RIGHT.

00:18:08.666 --> 00:18:10.702
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE
THE SATELLITE,

00:18:10.702 --> 00:18:12.704
DEFEAT THE DARK SIGNERS
ALL ON MY OWN.

00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:14.806
GOOD THING SHE REMINDED
ME THAT WITHOUT THE HELP

00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:17.742
OF MY FRIENDS, THERE WAS
NO WAY I COULD SUCCEED.

00:18:17.742 --> 00:18:19.677
GOODWIN, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW

00:18:19.677 --> 00:18:21.646
ABOUT THE DARK SIGNER
I DUELED.

00:18:21.646 --> 00:18:23.281
WHAT IS IT, YUSEI?

00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:25.717
THIS WASN'T
THE FIRST TIME
WE MET.

00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:27.752
HE WAS "INFECTED"
LIKE YOU SAID,
BUT HE KNEW ME.

00:18:27.752 --> 00:18:29.988
HE HAD ALL THESE
OLD MEMORIES
OF JACK AND I.

00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:33.224
IN FACT HE WAS
OUR FRIEND.

00:18:33.224 --> 00:18:34.692
YUSEI!

00:18:34.692 --> 00:18:36.394
AND HIS BIRDBRAIN
FRIEND.

00:18:36.394 --> 00:18:37.996
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WAITING

00:18:37.996 --> 00:18:39.397
FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:18:39.397 --> 00:18:42.433
IT'S A SHAME IT'LL
BE OVER SO QUICKLY.

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:45.303
SO HOW DO YOU
KNOW OUR NAMES?

00:18:45.303 --> 00:18:48.439
I NEVER FORGOT,
OLD FRIEND.

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:54.078
KALIN KESSLER?
IS THAT REALLY YOU?!

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:55.780
WE THOUGHT THAT WHEN
YOU LEFT THE SATELLITE

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.081
IT WAS FOREVER.

00:18:57.081 --> 00:18:59.717
IT WAS. BUT THANKS TO YOU
AND THAT MARK OF YOURS,

00:18:59.717 --> 00:19:01.152
KALIN IS BACK!

00:19:01.152 --> 00:19:02.420
Yusei, voice-over:
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.722
YEARS AGO, JACK, CROW,
AND I HAD A DUELING TEAM

00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:05.990
IN THE SATELLITE.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.359
KALIN WAS IN CHARGE
'CAUSE NO ONE COULD BEAT HIM.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:11.095
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
LOCKED UP FOR DUELING SECURITY,

00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:13.331
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S OUT
ON EARLY PAROLE

00:19:13.331 --> 00:19:15.133
LOOKING FOR REVENGE.

00:19:15.133 --> 00:19:17.302
AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO ME
THIS IS SWEET JUSTICE,

00:19:17.302 --> 00:19:18.736
DEAR OLD FRIEND!

00:19:18.736 --> 00:19:21.706
NOW PREPARE TO
MEET THE SHADOWS
OF THE NETHERWORLD!

00:19:21.706 --> 00:19:25.710
I SUMMON:
ONE HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON!

00:19:30.782 --> 00:19:33.918
AND NOW,
FOR YOUR PLEASURE:
THE MAIN EVENT!

00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:38.823
I ACTIVATE
HUNDRED-EYED DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:40.358
Yusei, voice-over: AND AS HARD
AS IT IS TO BELIEVE,

00:19:40.358 --> 00:19:42.260
HE'S GOTTEN EVEN BETTER.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.795
KALIN'S GOT
A NEW DECK

00:19:43.795 --> 00:19:46.764
FULL OF STRONGER MONSTERS
I'VE NEVER FACED BEFORE.

00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:50.268
HIS ONE-HUNDRED EYED
DRAGON WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

00:19:50.268 --> 00:19:52.704
THANKS FOR THE HELP,
YUSEI, CAUSE NOW THAT

00:19:52.704 --> 00:19:54.739
YOU DESTROYED MY
ONE-HUNDRED EYED DRAGON,

00:19:54.739 --> 00:19:56.974
I CAN SELECT ONE CARD
IN MY DECK

00:19:56.974 --> 00:19:58.710
AND THEN ADD IT
TO MY HAND.

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.478
HE SUMMONED
AN EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL.

00:20:00.478 --> 00:20:03.114
IT WAS HUGE,
LIKE EXODIA BUT BIGGER.

00:20:03.114 --> 00:20:04.716
IT WAS JUST LIKE
YOU SAID, GOODWIN.

00:20:04.716 --> 00:20:06.651
KALIN USED THE NEGATIVE ENERGY
OF THE PEOPLE

00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:09.053
OF THE SATELLITE
TO CREATE THAT THING.

00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:11.756
THE REST OF YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND THAT
GOODWIN'S RIGHT!

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:13.391
I'VE SEEN IT
WITH MY OWN EYES!

00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:15.760
JACK, I KNOW
YOU SAW IT, TOO!

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.829
IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END OF THE WORLD!

00:20:17.829 --> 00:20:20.331
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CCAPAC APU,

00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:23.668
POUND THIS
PATHETIC SIGNER
INTO THE DARKNESS!

00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:32.977
KALIN'S EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
WAS THE MOST POWERFUL CARD

00:20:32.977 --> 00:20:34.278
I EVER FACED.

00:20:34.278 --> 00:20:36.381
NOTHING COULD STOP
IT FROM ATTACKING.

00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:38.249
I'VE NEVER BEEN SCARED
IN A DUEL BEFORE,

00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:40.685
BUT THIS BEAST SHOOK ME
TO THE CORE,

00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:44.155
FILLED ME WITH DOUBT,
AND NEARLY SENT ME
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:46.657
AFTER THAT DUEL I DIDN'T
THINK I'D EVER BE ABLE

00:20:46.657 --> 00:20:49.193
TO THROWDOWN AGAIN,
BUT NOW I KNOW I HAVE TO

00:20:49.193 --> 00:20:52.163
FACE MY FEARS AND COME
AT THESE DARK SIGNERS

00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:54.465
WITH EVERYTHING I GOT.

00:20:55.733 --> 00:20:57.201
SO THEN, WHICH
OF YOU ARE WITH ME

00:20:57.201 --> 00:20:58.703
TO STOP
THIS SHADOW ARMY!

00:20:58.703 --> 00:20:59.771
JUST A SEC!

00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:01.873
I WANT SOME ANSWERS
BEFORE I RISK MY LIFE,

00:21:01.873 --> 00:21:03.307
AND THAT'S STARTING
WITH YOU!

00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:04.909
THERE'S SOMETHING
HE'S NOT TELLING US.

00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:06.744
JACK'S CORRECT.
I WAS HOPING TO AVOID

00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:08.713
THIS PART
OF THE DISCUSSION.

00:21:08.713 --> 00:21:09.881
AND HOW'ABOUT THAT!

00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:11.282
MORE SECRETS!

00:21:11.282 --> 00:21:12.650
I'M TWO SECONDS
FROM TAKIN' OFF

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.785
AND FORGETTING
ALL THIS STUFF

00:21:13.785 --> 00:21:15.453
ABOUT THE END
OF THE WORLD!

00:21:15.453 --> 00:21:16.888
COME ON!
LET'S HEAR HIM OUT!

00:21:16.888 --> 00:21:19.424
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK
AWAY RIGHT NOW, JACK!

00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:21.692
GOODWIN, WE WANNA KNOW
EV'RYTHING ABOUT ALL

00:21:21.692 --> 00:21:23.161
OF THESE DARK SIGNERS!

00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:24.962
YOU DON'T.

00:21:24.962 --> 00:21:27.131
THEY HAVE NEVER LOST,
UNLIKE THOSE PAWNS YOU

00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:29.801
FACED IN THE PARKING GARAGE
AND HOSPITAL.

00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.436
I'M NOT SURE
THEY CAN LOSE.

00:21:31.436 --> 00:21:32.703
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:21:32.703 --> 00:21:34.672
IT STILL COMES DOWN
TO A DECK!

00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:36.707
AND OURS ALWAYS
LOSE, YUSEI.

00:21:36.707 --> 00:21:39.911
YOU AND AKIZA SAW YOUR
DECKS PICKED APART,
LIKE SAYER'S.

00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:42.046
THE TASK THAT'S BEFORE US
JUST MIGHT BE

00:21:42.046 --> 00:21:45.683
IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER WIN.

00:21:45.683 --> 00:21:47.084
WONDERFUL.

00:21:47.084 --> 00:21:49.787
IF WE CAN'T WIN,
THEN WHY DO WE
DUEL?!

00:21:49.787 --> 00:21:51.622
UM, SIS?
CAN WE GO HOME?

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:52.657
I FEEL SICK NOW.

00:21:52.657 --> 00:21:54.725
YEAH, YOU'RE
NOT ALONE.

00:21:54.725 --> 00:21:57.328
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
WE'VE LOST BEFORE
THE FIRST DRAW?!

00:21:57.328 --> 00:21:59.764
I'M OUTTA HERE!
IF THE WORLD'S
GONNA END,

00:21:59.764 --> 00:22:02.266
I MIGHT AS WELL
SPEND MY LAST FEW
DAYS CRUISIN' ROUND

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.901
ON MY RUNNER!

00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:05.736
I'M NOT SAYING
THERE'S NO HOPE AT ALL.

00:22:05.736 --> 00:22:07.872
BUT I WANTED TO BE HONEST:
THERE WERE THREE DUELS

00:22:07.872 --> 00:22:10.708
WITH TRUE DARK SIGNERS,
UND'RSTAND?

00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:14.745
AND WE NEARLY LOST THEM
ALL THANKS TO THE MOST
POWERFUL MONSTERS EV'R.

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:17.682
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT PRIMAL FORCES,
PURE DARKNESS.

00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:19.884
A FOE MANY WOULD
CHOOSE TO RUN FROM.

00:22:19.884 --> 00:22:21.853
BUT I ASK THAT
YOU DO NOT.

00:22:21.853 --> 00:22:24.689
YOU MUST FACE ALL
OF THEM TOGETHER.

00:22:24.689 --> 00:22:26.257
BUT, EVEN IF WE
DO BEAT THEM,

00:22:26.257 --> 00:22:29.660
I CAN'T PROMISE WE'LL ALL
BE STANDING HERE AGAIN

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.063
OR THAT WE'LL BE ABLE
TO EXPEL THE DARKNESS

00:22:32.063 --> 00:22:33.764
THAT POSSESSES
THESE DARK SIGNERS

00:22:33.764 --> 00:22:37.269
AND RETURN THEM
TO THE PERSONS THEY ONCE WERE.

00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:39.271
EVERY WAR HAS
ITS CASUALTIES.

00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:42.941
AND SOME OF US MAY BE
LOST TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:45.076
I HOPE THE FOUR
OF YOU CAN LOOK

00:22:45.076 --> 00:22:47.312
INTO YOUR HEARTS
AND MAKE THE DECISION

00:22:47.312 --> 00:22:48.713
THAT OUR WORLD NEEDS.

00:22:48.713 --> 00:22:50.615
BUT BE QUICK,
I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE

00:22:50.615 --> 00:22:55.587
MUCH TIME LEFT.
