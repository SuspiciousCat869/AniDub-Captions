00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:52.665
EVIL DUELING ROBOTS
ON A RAMPAGE,

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.568
OVERWHELMING ODDS,
REAL BATTLE DAMAGE.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:57.737
HMM. SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD TIME.

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.373
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.008
IT'S TIME TO RIDE!

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.543
SHERRY AND ELSWORTH,

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.046
YOU GUYS ARE WITH ME.
LET'S DO THIS.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.420
Bruno: HEY, WAIT FOR ME!

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:16.423
Jakob: THE CIRCUIT
IS GATHERING

00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:18.358
MORE AND MORE STRENGTH.

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:21.094
EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:22.796
THAT'S GREAT AND ALL,
BUT WHY DOES

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:25.465
THE PLAN HAVE TO BE
SUCH A SNOOZE FEST?

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:28.268
WE'RE NOT DOING
THIS TO ENTERTAIN
OURSELVES, LESTER.

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:30.336
OURS IS
A NOBLE TASK.

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.138
OURS IS A BORING TASK.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:35.275
ALL THIS SITTING AROUND AND
WAITING IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:38.611
THESE TURBO DUELS
GENERATE THE POWER
OF ENER-D.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.181
THE POWER OF
ENER-D ENERGIZES
THE CIRCUIT.

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.949
AND WHEN THE CIRCUIT
IS COMPLETE,

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:45.452
THE DIVINE TEMPLE
WILL APPEAR.

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:47.587
SUCH A GLORIOUS
OCCASION IS
MORE IMPORTANT

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.889
THAN YOUR PERSONAL
AMUSEMENT.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.958
LOOK AT HOW BIG
THIS CIRCUIT IS.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.461
IT PRACTICALLY
COVERS THE
ENTIRE CITY.

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.330
IF A TEMPLE THAT
BIG SUDDENLY FALLS
FROM THE SKY,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.500
EVERYONE DOWN
THERE WILL BE IN
GREAT JEOPARDY.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.936
THAT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:05.305
THIS MUST BE DONE
IN ORDER TO--

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.673
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:08.975
WHAT?!
WHAT IS THIS?

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.877
Lester: THOSE ARE
PRIMO'S ROBOTS!

00:10:10.877 --> 00:10:12.479
I'M AWARE OF THAT!

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:14.447
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS,
WHY ARE THEY DISRUPTING

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.648
THE TOURNAMENT?

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:18.151
GUESS PRIMO GOT
SICK OF SITTING
ON THE SIDELINES

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.453
AND DECIDED TO STIR
UP SOME TROUBLE.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.755
[LAUGHING] NOW, THIS
IS MORE LIKE IT!

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:26.659
I WARNED HIM ABOUT TAKING
MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS.

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:32.332
HELLO?

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.267
I THINK YOU GUYS ARE
IN THE WRONG LANE.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.970
GO, NULLIFIER.
ATTACK HER DIRECTLY!

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.306
AAH!

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.275
NOT SO FAST!
HUH?

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:44.377
I PLAY SWIFT SCARECROW!

00:10:45.778 --> 00:10:47.447
WHO DID THAT?

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.222
HEY, AREN'T YOU...

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.224
JUST LEAVE THESE
JERKS TO ME!

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.227
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:03.630
JUNK SYNCHRON, WELCOME
TO THE BATTLE.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.765
NEXT, I SUMMON
SWIFT SCARECROW

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:06.766
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.501
AND MIRROR LADYBUG FROM
MY HAND.

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:13.506
AND NOW I'LL TUNE SWIFT
SCARECROW AND MIRROR LADYBUG

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.807
WITH MY JUNK SYNCHRON

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:17.944
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
STARDUST DRAGON.

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.118
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:31.724
STARDUST DRAGON,
TAKE FLIGHT,

00:11:31.724 --> 00:11:34.594
AND ATTACK
WITH COSMIC FLARE.

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:41.100
[GRUNTING]

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:47.807
AND NOW, ALLY OF
CLAUSOLAS, ATTACK HIM!

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.376
[SCREECHING]

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:51.477
WHOA!

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.813
Jack: I DON'T THINK SO!

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:56.316
Kaz: BY ACTIVATING BATTLE
EATER'S SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:11:56.316 --> 00:11:57.951
I CAN TAKE
THAT DAMAGE INSTEAD!

00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:58.952
[SCREECHING]

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.486
AAH!

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:04.023
DON'T BE
SO RECKLESS, KAZ.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.226
THE BATTLE DAMAGE
IS REAL!

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.361
RECKLESS IS
MY MIDDLE NAME, JACK.

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:11.097
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT IF YOU LAND IN
THE HOSPITAL AGAIN,

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.765
IT'S GOING TO MAKE
ME LOOK BAD.

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.834
HANG BACK FOR NOW.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.237
IT'S MY TURN.

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.938
I SUMMON
VICE BERSERKER.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.510
AND THEN, BY USING
ONE OF YOUR TRAP
CARDS AS BAIT,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.179
I CAN SUMMON
TO THE FIELD

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:27.680
TRAP EATER!

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:33.186
NOW VICE BERSERKER
GETS A TUNING
FROM TRAP EATER.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:44.764
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.304
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
VICE BERSERKER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY--

00:12:51.304 --> 00:12:52.572
RETRIBUTION.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:54.707
AFTER ALL, MY FAVORITE
KIND OF GHOST IS

00:12:54.707 --> 00:12:58.111
THE KIND THAT'S BEEN SMASHED
INTO A THOUSAND PIECES!

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.513
GO, ABSOLUTE POWERFORCE!

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.154
Leo: YEAH!
THE JACK ATTACK!

00:13:08.154 --> 00:13:09.255
THAT DOES IT!

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.857
I'M NOT LETTING THOSE
GUYS HAVE ALL THE FUN!

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:13.092
Leo: CROW, DON'T. YOU'RE
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:17.030
I'M FINE, I FEEL LIKE
A MILLION BUCKS! UGH!

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.199
YEAH? WELL, YOU SEEM MORE
LIKE 15 CENTS TO ME.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.467
IF YOU GO OUT THERE, CROW,

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:23.136
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO GET IN THE WAY.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.638
SOMETIMES BEING A GOOD
TEAMMATE MEANS LAYING LOW.

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.774
YOU SAY A LOT OF
SMART THINGS, LUNA.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:30.777
WELL, ONE OF US
HAS GOT TO, LEO.

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:33.446
SORRY, GUYS.
I'M ON THE BENCH.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.457
AH, SOMEONE IS MEDDLING,
AND I THINK I KNOW WHO.

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:45.591
PRIMO.
HUH?

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.029
GO AWAY. I'M A LITTLE
BUSY RIGHT NOW.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.865
HOW DARE YOU INTERFERE
WITH THE PRIME DIRECTIVE!

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.967
I AM DOING WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:57.036
BY FORCING ALL THESE
HUMANS INTO DUELING,

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:59.305
WE CAN CREATE THE
CIRCUIT IN NO TIME.

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:01.507
IF YOU FORCE THEM
TO BATTLE OUT OF FEAR,

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.676
YOU WON'T DRAW OUT
THEIR TRUE ABILITIES.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.979
THEY'LL BE SCARED
AND DESPERATE AND SLOPPY.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.916
AS A RESULT,
A PERFECT CIRCUIT
WILL NEVER BE FORMED.

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:11.150
Lester: BESIDES,
IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.286
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF A YUSEI
PROBLEM BREWING.

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.420
BETTER
TO PULL BACK NOW

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.823
THAN TO HAVE HIM
EMBARRASS YOU
A SECOND TIME.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:18.257
[LAUGHING]

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.625
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.929
MY PLAN IS IN MOTION.
THERE'S NO STOPPING IT NOW.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.063
PRIMO!

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:27.066
YUSEI FUDO, YOU'RE
MAKING A MISTAKE.

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.869
I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THOSE FOOLISH ENOUGH

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.404
TO GET IN MY WAY.

00:14:31.404 --> 00:14:32.939
AND NOW, I--

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:40.046
THEY'RE FLEEING.
I GUESS THEY'VE
HAD ENOUGH.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.047
HUH?

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.015
LOOKS LIKE THE GHOSTS
ARE GIVING UP.

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.384
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GIVING UP.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.252
LOOK AT
THEIR TRAJECTORIES.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.454
DON'T YOU SEE IT?

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.490
THEY'RE ALL GATHERING
IN ONE LOCATION!

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.793
[GRUNTING]

00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:55.695
AAH!

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:58.164
[EXPLOSION]

00:14:58.164 --> 00:14:59.866
WHERE TO NEXT?

00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:01.534
[ALARM BEEPING]
BEHIND US!

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.739
THERE'S TONS OF 'EM!

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.007
Sherry: AND ACCORDING
TO THE RADAR,

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:09.142
THERE'S MORE
ON THE WAY!

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:18.951
[LAUGHING]

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.386
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:23.256
IT'S THE SOUND OF
YOUR DEMISE, YUSEI.

00:15:41.574 --> 00:15:43.276
THERE ARE TOO MANY
OF THEM!

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.779
Elsworth: SHERRY'S
RIGHT. WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.715
Computer: ENGAGING
BATTLE ROYALE MODE.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:52.452
TOO LATE. WE'VE BEEN
FORCED INTO DUEL MODE.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.187
WE GOT TO DO THIS.

00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.055
YOU HAVE INTERFERED
WITH OUR MISSION.

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:58.024
FOR THAT YOU WILL PAY.

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:01.494
I SUMMON ALLY
OF JUSTICE GARADHOLG
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:04.230
THEN I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.165
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:07.767
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.436
I SUMMON SPIRIT
SUMMIT WARRIOR!

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.405
WHEN THIS MONSTER IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.274
I CAN SUMMON A LEVEL-3 WARRIOR
DIRECTLY FROM MY HAND

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.709
AND JOIN IT ON THE FIELD.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.479
I CALL FORTH LIBERATED
REAR WARRIOR!

00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:23.249
AND NOW I TUNE

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:24.650
LIBERATED REAR WARRIOR

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.486

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.922
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON

NOW IT IS MY TURN. I DRAW!

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:47.640
I AM ACTIVATING
THE OVERBOOST SPEED SPELL.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.077
BY LOWERING MY SPEED COUNTER
TO ONE DURING THE END PHASE,

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:52.545
I CAN USE OVERBOOST NOW

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:55.448
TO TEMPORARILY INCREASE
MY SPEED COUNTERS BY 4.

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:58.918
WITH THAT DONE, I CAN
ACTIVATE SPEED FUSION.

00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:01.153
THE SPEED SPELL ENABLES
ME TO TAKE

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.155
SPECIFIC MONSTERS
FROM MY HAND OR FIELD

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.824
AND SEND THEM
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:07.260
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
A FUSION MONSTER.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.896
AND THEN, BY COMBINING
SACRED KNIGHT'S SPEARHOLDER

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:11.464
AND HORSE
OF THE FLORAL KNIGHTS,

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:13.966
I CAN SUMMON CENTAUR MINA!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.440
NEXT, I'LL CALL OUT

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.913
AND NOW, CENTAUR MINA
RECEIVES A TUNING
FROM FLEUR SYNCHRON!

I SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:17:39.325 --> 00:17:42.161
NOW CHEVALIER DE FLEUR
ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:45.565
GO, FLEUR D'ORAGE!

00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:47.066
[GRUNTING]

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.039
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE I COME IN!

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:56.075
BY SENDING QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
FROM MY HAND TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.811
I CAN SUMMON

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.648
AND WHEN I'VE GOT
A TUNER OUT ON MY FIELD,

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.751
I CAN RESURRECT QUILLBOLT
HEDGEHOG FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.887
COME ON OUT TO THE FIELD,
LITTLE BUDDY.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:11.490
AND NOW I SUMMON

IN ATTACK MODE.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:16.395
NEXT UP, I'M TUNING
REED BUTTERFLY
AND QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.497
WITH MY QUICKDRAW SYNCHRON.

00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:30.109
I SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:33.512
I CAN KEEP

'CAUSE ROAD FIGHTER'S

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.718
