00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.571
MISS YOUR FRIEND?

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.040
I FREED HIS SPIRIT
SO HE COULD DUEL YOU

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:01.708
INSTEAD OF ME!

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:03.210
YOU CAN'T!

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.711
I WON'T DUEL MY FRIEND!

00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:06.380
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.215
YOU'RE EITHER
GOING TO ATTACK AND WIN

00:19:08.515 --> 00:19:09.917
OR BE ATTACKED AND LOSE!

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:11.885
NOW THEN, WHAT WILL IT BE?

00:19:12.553 --> 00:19:14.288
ARE YOU GOING TO BATTLE
YOUR CLOSEST FRIEND?

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:17.257
OR... JUST STAND THERE!
AND LET THE WORLD DOWN

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:20.527
IN ORDER TO SAVE THIS
ONE PATHETIC PAL OF YOURS?

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.429
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

00:19:23.096 --> 00:19:25.699
Rally: YUSEI... YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND HIS POWER!

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.035
HE CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS!

00:19:28.702 --> 00:19:29.703
I WON'T DUEL!

00:19:30.137 --> 00:19:31.138
YOU HAVE TO!

00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:32.873
YOU'RE THE ONLY HOPE LEFT!

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.143
LOOK AT HIM!
HE'S TAKEN EVERYONE!

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.111
YOU COWARD!

00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:40.514
I'M... I'M SORRY.

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:42.182
DON'T DO IT, RALLY!

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:43.817
OH, HE WILL DUEL!

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:45.886
EVEN IF IT MEANS
BEATING YOU!

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:51.124
I USE URU'S ABILITY!

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.595
BY SACRIFICING ONE OF
THE MONSTERS THAT'S
ON MY FIELD,

00:19:55.262 --> 00:19:56.730
I GET CONTROL
OF ONE OF YOURS.

00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.865
SORRY, YUSEI.

00:20:01.702 --> 00:20:04.171
I SUMMON TURBO ROCKET!

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:12.512
[GASP] RALLY, NO!
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.181
YOU HAVE TO ATTACK ME!

00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:16.383
DON'T MAKE THIS HARDER!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.051
WE NEED YOU!

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:20.253
ME AND TANK AND EVERYONE
ARE TRAPPED!

00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:21.922
I'M SORRY.

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:23.357
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.691
RALLY!

00:20:24.858 --> 00:20:26.693
I KNOW YOU'D RATHER GET
SENT TO THE NETHERWORLD

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:27.894
THAN DUEL ME, YUSEI.

00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:30.831
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO END
THIS DUEL ON MY OWN TERMS.

00:20:31.498 --> 00:20:33.934
I TUNE TURBO ROCKET
WITH MY TURBO BOOSTER

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:37.604
SO THAT I CAN SYNCHRO SUMMON
TURBO BOOSTER CANNON!

00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:40.140
[THINKING] THAT MONSTER
ONLY HAS ONE ABILITY!

00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:42.376
OH NO!

00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:45.078
I ACTIVATE MY CANNON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:45.746 --> 00:20:47.481
I CAN DESTROY ANY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:20:48.148 --> 00:20:49.383
AND THEN, HALF
ITS ATTACK POINTS

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:51.184
COUNT AS DAMAGE
TO ITS OWNER.

00:20:51.852 --> 00:20:54.621
AND, NO ONE SAID WHOSE
MONSTER I HAV'TA CHOOSE.

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:56.523
[GROWLS] NO!

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.558
GOOD LUCK, YUSEI.

00:20:59.226 --> 00:21:02.162
I'LL BE WATCHING...
FROM THE SHADOWS.

00:21:03.697 --> 00:21:05.032
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GET IT OVER WITH!

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:09.202
I DESTROY EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL URU!

00:21:12.139 --> 00:21:14.174
FIND A NEW PAWN ROMAN!

00:21:19.212 --> 00:21:23.283
[WAILS AND MOANS]

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:26.820
RALLY!

00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:28.955
OH NO...

00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:31.291
HEY YUSEI...

00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:33.527
YOU CAN BRING US BACK...

00:21:34.194 --> 00:21:36.163
I KNOW... YOU WILL...

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:45.372
RALLY!!!

00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:51.445
All: [BREATHING HEAVILY]
YUSEI!

00:21:52.112 --> 00:21:54.881
Roman: WELL I CERTAINLY WASN'T
EXPECTING THAT OUTCOME.

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:58.085
HEH! NO WONDER THE HUMAN
RACE IS GOING EXTINCT,

00:21:58.752 --> 00:22:00.053
NO ONE'S SELFISH ANYMORE.

00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:02.255
NOW BE KIND,
THEY DID JUST LOSE

00:22:02.923 --> 00:22:04.091
SOME FRIENDS
TO THE SHADOWS...

00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:05.292
ARE THEY?...

00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:08.195
GONE? YOUR PALS ARE WITH US
AND ALL THE OTHERS

00:22:08.862 --> 00:22:10.764
LOST FROM THIS TRASH HEAP
YOU CALL A TOWN.

00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:12.432
WANNA GET'EM BACK?

00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:15.068
WELL I'M RIGHT HERE
YUSEI... HEH!

00:22:15.736 --> 00:22:16.737
OR, ARE YOU SCARED?

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.106
[LAUGHS]

00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:22.109
YEAH. I'M SCARED.

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:24.778
SCARED ABOUT WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO TO YOU KALIN!

00:22:25.412 --> 00:22:26.413
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.882
YOUR DARK DECKS ARE
ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED!
