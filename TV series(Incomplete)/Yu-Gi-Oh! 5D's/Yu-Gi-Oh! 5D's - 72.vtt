MY TURBO WARRIOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.116

OF YOUR FLEUR DE
CHEVALIER IN HALF

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.922
BECAUSE YOUR MONSTER'S

MONSTER INTO A DISADVANTAGE.

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:56.496

WHY WASN'T IT DESTROYED?

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:02.669

IS PROTECTED

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.738
BY THE TRAP
FOR OUR DREAMS.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:07.541
BY SENDING ONE
MONSTER ON MY FIELD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.909
I CAN SPARE
ANOTHER MONSTER

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.911

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.312

AND SINCE FLEUR DE CHEVALIER
HAS EMERGED FROM THE BATTLE

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.318
UNSCATHED, SHE REGAINS
HER FULL STRENGTH.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.519

SHE HAS THE POWER

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.655
TO TAKE OUT TURBO
WARRIOR ON HER NEXT TURN.

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:22.656

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.324

MONSTER AND BRING JUNK WARRIOR

AND TURBO SYNCHRON BACK TO
THE FIELD UNTIL MY END PHASE.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:35.468
[THINKING]
BUT WHY DO THAT?

00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:37.804
HER CHEVALIER COULD WIPE
THE WALLS N' SCRUB THE FLOOR

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:39.706
WITH BOTH OF THOSE GUYS.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.374

YUSEI'S COMMITTED

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.809
QUITE THE <i>FAUX PAS...</i>

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.645
UNLESS OF COURSE THAT FACE
DOWN CARD HAPPENS TO BE

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.080
URGENT TUNING.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.550
AND IF MY HUNCH IS CORRECT,
THEN YOU COULD USE THAT CARD

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.687
TO RESURRECT TURBO WARRIOR
SO THAT IT CAN ATTACK

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.856
MY FLEUR DE
CHEVALIER AGAIN.

00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:59.059
BUT THEN MY CHEVALIER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY WOULD ACTIVATE

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:02.295
AND NEGATE THE EFFECT OF YOUR
TRAP CARD AND DESTROY IT.

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.631
I, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT ONE
WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE WOULD KNOW

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.000
THAT, SO THERE MUST
BE SOMETHING ELSE...

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.070
SOMETHING VERY CLEVER.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.240
TALK TO ME--WHAT IS
YOUR STRATEGY HERE?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.407
WELL?

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.109
Yusei: SHERRY, YOU CAN
USE CHEVALIER'S ABILITY

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:17.544
ONCE PER TURN.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.778
YOU GONNA DO IT?

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.548
AND PREVENT YOU FROM
GETTING RID OF TURBO WARRIOR?

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.551
NOW WHY WOULD I GO AND DO
SOMETHING AS FOOLISH AS THAT?

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.220
NO, YUSEI FUDO, I WANT TO
SEE WHAT IT IS YOU ARE HOPING

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.455
TO ACCOMPLISH.

AND WITH THEM
ON THE FIELD,

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:42.669

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.438
THAT IS WHAT I
WAS WAITING FOR.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.141
WITH CHEVALIER'S SPECIAL
ABILITY, I CAN PREVENT YOUR

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.211
TUNING AND OBLITERATE
YOUR TRAP CARD!

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.446
NOW YOU ARE WITHOUT
TRAPS, YUSEI FUDO.

00:06:53.446 --> 00:06:55.782
BUT I IMAGINE YOU EXPECTED
THIS WOULD HAPPEN AND SO YOU

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.151
PREPARED YOURSELF...

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.319
WITH A SPELL.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.054
WHICH IS WHY I AM NOW,
AT THIS POINT,

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:02.789
REVEALING MY TRAP CARD.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.357
CHAIN CLOSE!

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.893
THIS TRAP WILL PREVENT YOU
FROM ACTIVATING WHATEVER SPELL

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.929
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
PLANNING ON USING.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.398
[THINKING]
SHE JUST SHUT YUSEI
DOWN COMPLETELY.

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:14.000
WITH NO TRAPS AND NO SPELLS,
THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING HER

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.102
FROM USING FLEUR DE CHEVALIER
TO TAKE OUT ONE OF HIS

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.871
MONSTERS ON HER NEXT TURN.

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.005
Yusei: YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHERRY.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.174
I DID PREPARE MYSELF
WITH A SPELL...

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:23.043
BUT I ALSO PREPARED
FOR YOUR TRAP.

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:24.711
[GASPS]
I'M GOING TO ATTACK

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.013

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:27.681
AH!

00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.316
BUT IT WON'T WIN.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:31.084
IT DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH ATTACK POINTS.

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:33.019
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.822
AND FORCE YOUR CHEVALIER
INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.590
THAT DOES
NOTHING FOR YOU.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.626
THAT LITTLE SYNCHRON
HAS NO HOPE

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.995
OF CRASHING THROUGH FLEUR

COMES DAMAGE.

00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:17.964
I ACTIVATE
MY TURBO'S ABILITY.

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.699
SEE, WHEN IT ATTACKS
AND LOSES,

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:20.967
ITS ABILITY
LETS ME SUMMON

00:08:20.967 --> 00:08:22.535
A MONSTER
FROM MY HAND

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.937
AS LONG AS ITS
ATTACK POINTS AREN'T

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:25.739
GREATER THAN
THE DAMAGE I TOOK.

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:26.840
HMM!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.909
SO I'M SUMMONING
JUNK COLLECTOR!

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.111
AND NOW,
I ACTIVATE

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:33.146
JUNK COLLECTOR'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:34.347
THIS FORCES ME
TO REMOVE

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.648
A TRAP CARD IN
MY GRAVEYARD

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:36.983
FROM
PLAY ENTIRELY...

00:08:36.983 --> 00:08:39.486
BUT IN DOING SO, IT
LETS ME ACTIVATE IT!

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:42.122
SEE, I HAD A FEELING
YOU'D SEND URGENT TUNING

00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:43.723
TO THE GRAVEYARD WHEN
YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:44.758
Sherry: NICE MOVE.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:45.792
OH, YEAH?

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:46.793
IF YOU THOUGHT
THAT WAS NICE,

00:08:46.793 --> 00:08:48.328
THEN THIS NEXT
MOVE IS TOTALLY

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:49.796
GOING TO
BLOW YOU AWAY.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:51.231
Yusei: THAT'S RIGHT, SHERRY!

00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:55.135
NOW I TUNE JUNK WARRIOR WITH
MY TURBO SYNCHRON IN ORDER TO

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:57.871
SYNCRO SUMMON
TURBO WARRIOR!

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.241
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.550
Sherry: SO MUCH SACRIFICE
FOR ONE MONSTER...

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.086
IT SEEMS YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF
FLYING TOO CLOSE TO THE SUN.

00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.924
GO, TURBO WARRIOR!
TAKE OUT SHERRY'S FLEUR
DE CHEVALIER!

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.365
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.167
[THINKING] YUSEI'S
SO CLOSE TO LOSING...

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:28.935
BUT HE SEEMS
TO BE HAVING FUN.

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.270
AND HER.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.906
THE WAY HE DUELS WITH HER
IS DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.140
HE DUELS WITH ME.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.443
IT'S LIKE WHEN HE
DUELS JACK AND CROW.

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:37.677
HE'S FULL OF SPIRIT.

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:39.479
HE'S DUELING
FROM THE HEART.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.581
WHY ISN'T HE LIKE
THAT WITH ME?

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.986
Sherry: YOU MAY HAVE VANQUISHED
FLEUR DE CHEVALIER...

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:49.089
BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO,
YOU DROVE YOURSELF TO THE

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.325
BRINK OF DEFEAT, WHERE YOU ARE
NOW HANGING ON BY A THREAD.

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:55.528
WITH SPEED WORLD 2 IN PLAY,
AS LONG AS I HAVE 4 OR MORE

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.763
SPEED COUNTERS...

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:59.766
I CAN DEAL 800 POINTS OF
DAMAGE FOR EVERY SPEED SPELL

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:00.800
IN MY HAND.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.836
AND--AS IT SO HAPPENS--

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.172
[LAUGHS]
I CURRENTLY HAVE 4
SPEED COUNTERS...

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.507
BUT NO CARDS IN MY HAND.

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:10.376
SO YOUR FATE TODAY
DEPENDS ON MY NEXT DRAW.

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.378
SHOULD I DRAW A SPEED
SPELL FROM MY HAND,

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.980
IT WILL BE ALL
OVER FOR YOU.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.215
[GRUNTS]

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:17.350
BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU
LIVE FOR, IS IT NOT?

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.652
YOU FEEL MOST ALIVE WHEN
YOU ARE AT THE EDGE.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:22.021
YET SOMEWHERE IN YOUR HEART,
YOU KNOW THAT SUCH

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.224
RECKLESSNESS WILL BE
YOUR UNDOING ONE DAY.

00:10:24.224 --> 00:10:25.525
HMM.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.260
[THINKING] HOW DOES SHE
KNOW WHAT'S IN HIS HEART?

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.929
I GUESS AS TURBO DUELISTS,
THEY UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.198
THE SPEED, THE WIND,
THE RUSH--

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:34.334
IT MUST CREATE A BOND
BETWEEN DUELISTS THAT

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:35.935
I'VE NEVER REALLY KNOWN.

00:10:35.935 --> 00:10:38.404
Sherry: LET US SEE IF YOU WILL
FALL FROM YOUR EDGE.

00:10:38.404 --> 00:10:40.073
I DRAW MY CARD!

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.514
I SUMMON SACRED KNIGHT'S
SHIELD-BEARER IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:51.551
[THINKING] SHE DIDN'T
DRAW A SPEED SPELL.

00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.821
Sherry: NEXT, I
ACTIVATE SHIELD-BEARER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:10:54.821 --> 00:10:57.757
BY REMOVING ONE SACRED KNIGHT
CARD FROM MY GRAVEYARD...

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.727
I AM ABLE TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD FROM MY DECK!

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:02.829
SO--SHE GETS
TO DRAW AGAIN?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.863
Sherry: HA HA HA!

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.572
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:14.274
[SIGHS]

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:18.778
I HAD TWO CHANCES, BUT FATE
WAS ON YOUR SIDE BOTH TIMES.

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:20.813
I SIMPLY MUST HAVE
YOU ON MY TEAM.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.484
TELL ME, YUSEI FUDO,
WHAT IS IT YOU ARE

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:26.052
DUELING FOR?

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.488
WHY ARE YOU ENTERING THE
WORLD RACING GRAND PRIX

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.622
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.057
I DUNNO.

00:11:31.057 --> 00:11:33.126
I MEAN, WHY DO MOUNTAIN
CLIMBERS CLIMB MOUNTAINS?

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.494
IT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE THERE.

00:11:34.494 --> 00:11:35.728
ISN'T THAT
WHAT THEY SAY?

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.198
SO IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HAVE NO REASON.

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.833
THERE IS NOTHING DRIVING
YOU BUT THRILL, AMBITION...

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:42.101
PERHAPS BOREDOM...

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.604
SO TELL ME, WHAT ARE
YOU DRIVEN BY?

00:11:44.604 --> 00:11:48.308
IF YOU MUST KNOW,
MONSIEUR FUDO,

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:51.244
I AM DRIVEN BY MY
HUNGER FOR REVENGE.

00:11:51.244 --> 00:11:54.180
AND I WILL STOP AT NOTHING
UNTIL I HAVE FINALLY

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.381
ACHIEVED IT.

00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:11.464
SO, SHERRY, YOU'RE
OUT FOR REVENGE?

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.166
AGAINST WHO?

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.535
I WILL TELL YOU.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:17.637
I WAS BORN INTO
THE LEBLANC FAMILY.

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:19.806
MY PARENTS WERE
EXTREMELY WEALTHY--

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:21.941
MY FATHER, THE HEAD
OF A CARD COMPANY

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.843
HE INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER.

00:12:23.843 --> 00:12:25.645
MY CHILDHOOD WAS
A HAPPY ONE.

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.880
WINTERS IN THE MOUNTAINS,
SUMMERS AT OUR ESTATE

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.115
IN THE COUNTRY,

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.985
HORSEBACK RIDING LESSONS,
PIANO LESSONS, CROQUET GAMES

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:33.453
ON COOL AFTERNOONS...

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:36.589
AND MY PARENTS--THEY
WERE CAREFREE AND KIND.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.458
BUT THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE.

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.226
Father: NO, YOU
LISTEN TO ME!

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.495
YOU'RE NEVER
GETTING MY COMPANY.
WE ARE NOT SELLING.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.098
AND IF YOU EVER THREATEN ME
AND MY FAMILY AGAIN,

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:47.634
THINGS ARE GOING TO
GET REALLY UGLY.

00:12:47.634 --> 00:12:50.637
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'D
REALLY HURT US, DO YOU?

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:51.838
[GASPS]
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:53.072
[GIGGLES]

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.807
Sherry, voice-over:
MY PARENTS TRIED TO SHIELD ME

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:56.709
FROM ALL THAT
WAS GOING ON.

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:01.781
ONE AFTERNOON, MY FATHER
GAVE ME THE MOST ADORABLE

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.852
LITTLE TEDDY BEAR,
AND THEN, THAT NIGHT,

00:13:05.852 --> 00:13:08.521
I WAS TORN OUT OF MY
SLEEP BY NOISES--

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:11.190
SCREAMING, SHOUTING.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.427
FRIGHTENED, I WENT TO
MY PARENTS' ROOM.

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:15.695
[GASP]

00:13:15.695 --> 00:13:18.665
THE ROOM WAS A MESS,
THINGS THROWN EVERYWHERE.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:20.667
MY PARENTS WERE
NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.169
OUR BUTLER,
ELSWORTH, FOUND ME,

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.370
TOLD ME NOT
TO BE SCARED.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.373
TOGETHER,
WE FLED THE ESTATE.

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:29.976
[CRYING]

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.879
ELSWORTH EXPLAINED
THE SITUATION TO ME.

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:35.014
A CORPORATION HAD
BEEN TRYING TO PURCHASE

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.549
MY FATHER'S BUSINESS.

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:39.485
WHEN MY FATHER REFUSED,
STRANGE MEN BEGAN

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.688
COMING AROUND,
MAKING THREATS...

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.056
AND THEN...

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:46.459
HE TOLD ME--WE COULD NEVER
AGAIN RETURN TO THE ESTATE.

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.294
I WAS JUST A CHILD
AT THE TIME.

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.930
I UNDERSTOOD SO LITTLE
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.399
ELSWORTH EXPLAINED THAT
WE HAD TO KEEP MOVING,

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.901
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO
HAD COME FOR MY PARENTS

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.070
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR ME.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.105
AND SO WE JOURNEYED FROM
COUNTRY TO COUNTRY...

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:00.406
CITY TO CITY...

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:03.176
RELENTLESSLY PURSUED BY THE
MONSTERS WHO HAD TAKEN

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.444
MY PARENTS FROM ME.

00:14:04.444 --> 00:14:06.546
ALONG THE WAY, I LEARNED
THAT THE CORPORATION

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:08.481
WAS JUST A FRONT.

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:12.285
THE REAL ORGANIZATION PURSUING
ME IS KNOWN AS YLIASTER.

00:14:12.285 --> 00:14:14.053
YLIASTER?!

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:15.221
I THINK I HEARD
THAT NAME

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.989
FROM GOODWIN'S
BROTHER, ROMAN.

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.392
SAYER USED TO TELL
ME ABOUT THEM.

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:20.960
HE'D SAY THEY WERE EVIL
AND OUT TO DESTROY

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.462
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:23.896
Sherry: FROM WHAT LITTLE
I HAVE GATHERED,

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:27.400
THEY ARE A SECRET
SOCIETY WITH WILD IDEAS
ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.869
THEY OPERATE FROM THE SHADOWS
AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.772
GET RID OF THOSE WHO
STAND IN THEIR WAY.

00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:34.874
WHICH IS WHY THEY CAME
FOR MY FAMILY.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.009
I'M SO SORRY, SHERRY.

00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:41.547
EVENTUALLY, I DISCOVERED
THE REAL REASON THEY ARE

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:42.849
SO DESPERATE TO FIND ME.

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:45.918
IN THE TEDDY BEAR
MY FATHER GAVE ME,

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:46.886
HE HID SOMETHING...

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.221
Akiza: WHAT WAS IT?

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.590
UNTIL I AM CERTAIN I CAN
TRUST YOU, THAT WILL REMAIN

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.724
MY SECRET.

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:55.194
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME,
YUSEI FUDO.

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.630
YLIASTER IS PULLING
THE STRINGS BEHIND
THE UPCOMING

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.365
WORLD RACING
GRAND PRIX.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.566
WAIT. ARE YOU SURE?

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.667
<i>OUI...</i>

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.270
THIS IS WHY I WANT MORE
THAN ANYTHING TO WIN...

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.338
TO GET CLOSER TO THEM!

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:10.042
EVEN MORE THAN REVENGE,
I NEED ANSWERS, YUSEI FUDO.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:12.712
I MUST KNOW WHAT YLIASTER
DID WITH MY PARENTS AND WHAT

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:13.846
THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO.

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:15.982
I MUST WIN THIS RACE.

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:18.418
AND I KNOW I CAN DO SO
WITH YOU ON MY TEAM.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.319
YUSEI'S ALREADY GOT
TEAMMATES, FRENCHY.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:22.388
HE'S RACING WITH HIS FRIENDS.
HE'S NOT JUST GONNA--

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.756
NO ONE IS
TALKING TO YOU.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.991
HANG ON A SEC.

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:25.992
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DON'T KNOW

00:15:25.992 --> 00:15:27.460
THE FIRST THING
ABOUT YUSEI.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.628
I KNOW PLENTY.

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:30.663
IN JUST A FEW TURNS,
WE HAVE COME TO KNOW

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.998
EACH OTHER'S SPIRITS.

00:15:31.998 --> 00:15:34.667
AS TURBO DUELISTS WE HAVE COME
TO UNDERSTAND THE WINDS THAT

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.335
STIR US FROM WITHIN.

00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:38.838
DURING THE GRAND PRIX,
I WILL BE RIDING
FULL THROTTLE

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:40.506
ON THE CUTTING EDGE
WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.141
AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN!

00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:45.511
IS THAT NOT THE KIND OF DUEL
YOU WANT IN ON, YUSEI FUDO?

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.346
IF YOU RACE WITH ME,

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:50.049
YOU WILL FIND THE
DRIVE YOU SEEK.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.651
LOOK, I, UH...

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.620
I DO NOT REQUIRE AN ANSWER
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.456
JUST THINK IT OVER.

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.890
IT IS YOUR
TURN NOW, NO?

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.891
HMM.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:15:59.792
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:04.530
Yusei:
ALRIGHTY, THEN...

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.899
LET'S FINISH THIS!

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.167
I ACTIVATE
THE EFFECT

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.603
OF THE SPEED WORLD
2 FIELD SPELL.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:12.972
BY REMOVING 7 OF
MY SPEED COUNTERS,

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:14.807
I CAN DRAW ANOTHER CARD.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:18.744
I SUMMON THE DRILL
SYNCHRON TUNER MONSTER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.915
AND NOW TURBO WARRIOR,
TAKE OUT SACRED KNIGHT'S

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.150
SHIELD-BEARER!

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.555
TIME TO DRILL THIS
MANEUVER HOME!

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.824
EVEN THOUGH SHIELD-BEARER
WAS IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.594
DRILL SYNCHRON CAN
DRIVE FORWARD AND DEAL
THE POINT DIFFERENCE

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:35.528
TO YOU AS DAMAGE.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.998
UH!

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.034
AND WHEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE
FROM DRILL SYNCHRON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:43.903
I CAN DRAW ANOTHER
CARD FROM MY DECK!

00:16:43.903 --> 00:16:46.739
I REVEAL THE FREEDOM
RELEASE TRAP CARD!

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.107
Computer: WHEN A MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.709
IS DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:52.078
THE TRAP FREEDOM RELEASE
RETURNS ALL MONSTERS

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:54.580
ON THE FIELD TO
THEIR OWNER'S DECKS.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.916
Sherry: NOW
YOUR MONSTERS
MUST ABANDON YOU,

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:58.885
LEAVING YOU TO FEND
FOR YOURSELF,

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:00.720
SOMETHING I PROMISE
WILL NEVER HAPPEN IF

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.588
YOU JOIN MY
TEAM, YUSEI.

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.056
[GRUNTS]

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.526
THANKS, BUT I WONT
BE ALONE FOR LONG.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.194
[THINKING] HOW CAN YUSEI
BE SO CONFIDENT?

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.695
HIS FIELD'S WIDE OPEN.

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.098
IF SHE DRAWS A SPEED SPELL
OR MONSTER ON THE NEXT TURN,

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.299
HE'S DONE FOR...

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.568
UNLESS THOSE FACEDOWNS
ARE GAME CHANGERS.

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:18.538
HA HA HA!
IT IS MY TURN NOW!

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.741
I SUMMON SACRED KNIGHT
JOAN IN ATTACK MODE!

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.845
Akiza, thinking:
THIS IS IT.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:30.216
Sherry: UNFORTUNATELY,
SACRED KNIGHT
JOAN MUST SACRIFICE

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:32.685
300 ATTACK POINTS
IN ORDER TO ATTACK.

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:34.754
BUT THAT ISN'T
GOING TO STOP HER!

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:37.156
SACRED KNIGHT JOAN,
TAKE HIM OUT!!

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:42.395
Yusei: I REVEAL MY SYNCHRO
SPIRITS TRAP CARD!

00:17:42.395 --> 00:17:44.997
NOW IF I REMOVE A SYNCHRO
MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.633
FROM PLAY, I CAN BRING
BACK THE MONSTERS I TUNED

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:48.701
TO SUMMON IT!

00:17:48.701 --> 00:17:50.436
SO BY REMOVING JUNK WARRIOR...

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:54.273
I CAN SUMMON JUNK SYNCHRON AND
SPEED WARRIOR IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.610
Sherry: AN INTERESTING TWIST.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.011
I WONDER WHAT'S NEXT.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.880
I CANNOT WAIT.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.114
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.253
[THINKING] I'VE NEVER
EXPERIENCED A DUEL LIKE THIS...

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:10.156
THE SPEED OF THEIR ATTACKS,
THEIR DEFENSES...

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.625
AND THE WAY THEY JUST GO
BACK AND FORTH, PERFECTLY

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:14.994
ANTICIPATING EACH OTHER,
CONSTANTLY OUTTHINKING

00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:16.162
EACH OTHER...

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:17.997
IS WHAT SHERRY SAID TRUE?

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:20.132
DO TURBO DUELISTS GET EACH
OTHER IN WAYS THAT OTHER

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.601
DUELISTS DON'T?

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.737
DOES--DOES SHE REALLY ALREADY
KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THINGS

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:26.772
ABOUT YUSEI THAT I
CAN'T BECAUSE I'M NOT

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:28.240
A TURBO DUELIST?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.012
AND THE OTHERS--TRUDGE,
KALIN, JACK, CROW...

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:34.814
ARE THEY ALL
CONNECTED BY SOMETHING

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.549
I'LL NEVER BE
A PART OF?

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.884
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.520
AND FROM MY HAND,
I ACTIVATE THE HIGH
SPEED CRASH

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.922
SPEED SPELL!

00:18:42.922 --> 00:18:45.558
WITH TWO SPEED COUNTERS,
I CAN USE THIS SPELL TO SEND

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:48.227
ONE CARD ON MY FIELD CRASHING
INTO ANY OTHER CARD IN ORDER

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:49.795
TO DESTROY THEM BOTH.

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:52.331
SO YOU'RE LOOKING
TO SACRIFICE YOUR
FACEDOWN CARD

00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:54.133
IN ORDER TO
VANQUISH JOAN.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.802
HOWEVER, DUE TO JOAN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.739
WHEN SHE IS DESTROYED,
I CAN MOVE ONE SPELL CARD FROM

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:01.374
MY GRAVEYARD TO MY HAND.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.209
A SPEED SPELL.

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:04.877
Yusei: I'M DESTROYING
MY FACEDOWN CARD

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.679
ALONG WITH MY
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:08.714
YOU ARE DESTROYING
YOUR OWN MONSTER!?

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:10.549
SURE AM, BUT NOT
BEFORE ACTIVATING

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.218
THE STARLIGHT
ROAD TRAP.

00:19:12.218 --> 00:19:14.053
<i>CA NE ME PLAIT PAS!</i>

00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:16.355
I'LL ASSUME THAT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT TOO HAPPY

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.357
SINCE MY STARLIGHT
ROAD'S EFFECT

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.426
SAVES MY SPEED
WARRIOR AND ALLOWS ME

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:22.294
TO SUMMON
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.229
OH!

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.632
Yusei and Akiza:
WATCH OUT!!!

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:43.716
OH, NO!
SHERRY!

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:44.617
[GASPS]

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:48.187
HELLO AGAIN!

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.856
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T A
WELL-BALANCED PERSON

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:54.026
AND THAT IT WOULD
NOT BE SMART TO MESS
AROUND WITH ME!

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:54.727
HA HA HA!

00:19:56.062 --> 00:19:58.064
LEAVE THIS
TO ME--GIMME!

00:19:58.064 --> 00:20:00.099
WHOA, HANG ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE NEED TO--

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:01.567
I'M GONNA
SUMMON THIS MONSTER!

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.702
WHAT!?

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.570
[THINKING] THIS IS
THE ONLY WAY...

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.441
COME FORTH,
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.384
Sherry: YOU ARE
A PSYCHIC DUELIST!?

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:26.525
Computer: EMERGENCY.
DUEL MODE DISENGAGED.

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:27.493
[GRUNT]
[GRUNT]

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.763
DRAT!!

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:37.303
Mystery Man: MOVE IT.

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:38.771
Elsworth: OH, I'LL
MOVE IT, ALL RIGHT.

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:39.839
[PUNCH]

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:40.973
UH!
UH!
UH!

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:53.986
Yusei: SHERRY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.222
Sherry: I AM,
THANKS TO YOUR...

00:20:56.222 --> 00:20:57.423
FRIEND.

00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:01.560
DID YOU TAKE CARE OF
THOSE THUGS, ELSWORTH?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.395
BUT OF COURSE.

00:21:03.395 --> 00:21:04.797
SO THIS IS YUSEI.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.635
A PLEASURE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU.

00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:13.239
WELL, YUSEI FUDO...

00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:15.875
HAD OUR DUEL CONTINUED ON
ITS PROPER COURSE...

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.210
I IMAGINE STARDUST DRAGON
WOULD HAVE VANQUISHED

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.779
SACRED KNIGHT JOAN...

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:23.349
AND THEN SPEED WARRIOR WOULD
HAVE ATTACKED ME DIRECTLY.

00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:26.252
BUT THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT
ME WITH 50 LIFE POINTS

00:21:26.252 --> 00:21:29.321
AND ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
TO DEFEAT YOU.

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.823
Yusei: YUP.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:21:30.823 --> 00:21:32.224
AND SO THE WHOLE THING

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.260
WOULD'VE COME DOWN
TO YOUR NEXT DRAW.

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.766
I WON'T DRAW.

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.635
PERHAPS ON ANOTHER DAY.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:45.004
THERE IS A LONG
ROAD AHEAD, <i>MON AMI.</i>

00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:49.241
UNTIL NEXT TIME,
YUSEI FUDO.

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.077
AND YOU--I AM IN YOUR DEBT.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.314
I HOPE TO RIDE AGAINST
YOU ONE DAY...

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.949
OR WITH YOU.

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:58.184
HUH?

00:21:58.184 --> 00:21:59.819
<i>AU REVOIR ET SALUT!</i>

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.424
[THINKING] THAT DUEL
WAS INCREDIBLE.

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:06.892
I WANT MORE.

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:10.396
I WANT TO BE A PART OF WHAT
THEY'RE ALREADY A PART OF.

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:12.998
I WANNA BECOME
A TURBO DUELIST.

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.508
[THINKING] THAT SHERRY
GOT ME THINKING...

00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:24.009
Sherry's voice:
TELL ME, YUSEI FUDO--

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:26.111
WHAT IS IT
YOU ARE DUELING FOR?

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.380
[THINKING]
WHAT <i>AM</i> I DUELING FOR?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.783
I THINK IT'S TIME
I TRY AND FIND OUT.
