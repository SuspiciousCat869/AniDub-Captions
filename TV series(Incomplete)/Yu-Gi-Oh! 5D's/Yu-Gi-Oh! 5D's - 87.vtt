INFERNITY REFLECTOR!

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:50.550
YOU SEE...

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:54.053
WHEN A MONSTER WITH INFERNITY
IN ITS NAME IS DESTROYED...

00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:56.356
I CAN NEGATE ITS DESTRUCTION
BY SIMPLY SENDING

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.192
ALL THE CARDS IN MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.563
AND THEN YOU TAKE 1000
POINTS OF DIRECT DAMAGE.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.967
[THINKING]
NOW HE'S CARDLESS--
JUST AS HE LIKES.

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:13.606
WHAT NOW?!

00:11:14.274 --> 00:11:14.974
I DON'T KNOW.

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:16.976
NOW KALIN WINS!

00:11:17.644 --> 00:11:18.912
[LAUGHS]

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:24.984
I PLACE ONE FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.290
[THINKING] HOPEFULLY
IT WON'T BE MY LAST!

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:49.576
MY TURN, YUSEI...

00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.145
I'LL PLAY ONE FACEDOWN...

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.448
AND THEN ACTIVATE
RANDOMIZER'S ABILITY!

00:11:56.516 --> 00:11:58.651
WITH IT, ONCE PER TURN,
I DRAW ONE CARD

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:01.254
AND THEN SEND THAT CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD...

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.423
IF THE CARD I DRAW
IS A MONSTER CARD...

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.294
THEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL TO
ITS LEVEL MULTIPLIED BY 200.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.496
HOWEVER, IF IT'S
NOT A MONSTER CARD...

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:13.166
THEN I TAKE
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.501
SO THEN IT ALL
COMES DOWN TO DUMB LUCK?

00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:18.037
THAT'S NOT
LIKE YOU, KALIN.

00:12:18.705 --> 00:12:19.806
NO, IT'S NOT LUCK...

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:21.841
IT COMES DOWN TO FATE.

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:24.043
FATE WILL DECIDE.

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:26.412
WAIT. IS IT JUST ME...

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.615
OR IS KALIN ACTING OFF?

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:30.483
HE IS GONNA WIN, RIGHT?!

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.319
OH, YEAH, SURE,
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:51.437
MONSTER--LEVEL 6.

00:12:52.805 --> 00:12:53.373
LEVEL 6?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.707
LET'S DITCH
THIS DUEL!

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.409
Man: THE DUEL WILL GO ON.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.278
SAYS WHO?

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:03.650
FINE.

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:07.020
[CRIES OUT IN PAIN]

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:10.223
I END MY TURN.

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.493
[THINKING] NOT GOOD.
I'M HERE TO RESCUE KALIN

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.096
BUT AT THIS RATE
I'M GONNA BE
THE ONE NEEDING HELP.

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.705
GUESS IT'S GOOD TO KNOW...

00:13:26.372 --> 00:13:27.307
EVEN WAY OUT HERE...

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.109
SOMETHING PURE CAN BLOOM.

00:13:32.245 --> 00:13:34.681
YES, YUSEI BUT IT'S
NOT JUST THESE FLOWERS
THAT CAN BLOOM.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:36.749
HOPE BLOOMS AS WELL.

00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.119
IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW
MANAGE TO DEFEAT
KALIN IN A DUEL...

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.121
THEN I HAVE
THE TOOLS TO FREE HIM

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.925
BEFORE HE'S BANISHED
TO THAT MINE FOREVER.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.263
[THINKING] I HAVE
TO FOCUS...

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:54.133
I CAN'T LET KALIN
END UP IN THAT MINE!

00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:56.402
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:00.239
AND I SUMMON
MAX WARRIOR!

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.878
Duel runner computer:
MAX WARRIOR IS A LEVEL 4
WIND ATTRIBUTE MONSTER

00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.316
WITH 1800 ATTACK POINTS
AND 800 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:13.686
[THINKING] IF I PLAY
MY CARDS RIGHT,

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.355
MAYBE I CAN
CONVINCE KALIN

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.190
HE DOESN'T BELONG
IN THOSE MINES...

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.925
AND THE BEST WAY
TO DO THAT...

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.427
IS TO GET DOWN AND DIRTY
IN THIS DUEL.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.529
IF I CONFRONT KALIN
HEAD ON,

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:24.597
I MAY BE ABLE TO SEE

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:26.432
WHAT'S GOING ON
DEEP WITHIN HIS HEART

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.401
AND GET HIM TO FINALLY
FORGIVE HIMSELF

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.870
FOR ALL OF HIS
PAST MISTAKES.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.173
MAX WARRIOR ATTACKS
INFERNITY RANDOMIZER!

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:35.842
AND THANKS TO
MAX'S ABILITY,

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:37.043
DURING THE DAMAGE STEP,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.445
HE GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:41.581
NOW LET HIM HAVE IT!

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.986
WELL DONE, YUSEI,
BUT I SAW THAT COMING...

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:48.821
NOW THEN...

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.290
OH NO...

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.360
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN,
THE TRAP DAMAGE GATE.

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:57.330
NOW I CAN SUMMON ONE MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.399
WHOSE ATTACK POINTS
ARE EQUAL OR LESS THAN

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:01.267
THE DAMAGE I JUST TOOK.

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:05.471
AND THE MONSTER I SUMMON
IS INFERNITY BEETLE.

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:08.408
THEN SPEED WARRIOR WILL
JUST HAVE TO ATTACK
YOUR NEW MONSTER.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.077
BUT THEY BOTH HAVE
THE SAME ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.312
WHAT'S HE TRYIN' TO DO?

00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:20.353
NOW BY DESTROYING
THE EQUIP SPELL
FIGHTING SPIRIT...

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.423
SPEED WARRIOR
SURVIVES THE CLASH!

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.359
THAT'S MY TURN.

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:29.028
YOU NEVER CHANGE.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:32.398
YOU'RE NOT SIMPLY
TRYING TO WIN, YUSEI...

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.033
YOU'RE TRYING
TO BRING OUT MY HEART

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.601
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:36.869
AREN'T YOU?

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:38.805
PERHAPS.

00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:40.640
THE PROBLEM IS...

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.141
THE HEART YOU SEEK...

00:15:42.809 --> 00:15:43.676
IS LONG GONE.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.545
THAT ISN'T TRUE!

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:48.948
IT IS TRUE AND I DESERVE
WHATEVER I GET.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.183
COME ON, KALIN!

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.418
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
ALL ABOUT OUR PAST?

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:54.687
ALL OF THE THINGS
THAT WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER?

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:57.023
TRY AND THINK BACK!

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:01.794
YOU GUYS READY TO GO
TAKE DOWN THE AMBULATORS?

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:04.130
YEAH.

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:09.368
TIME FOR THE ENFORCERS
TO DO SOME ENFORCING!

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:11.471
REMEMBER?

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:15.174
YEAH. BUT I ALSO
REMEMBER THE BAD TIMES...

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:17.643
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:28.454
I TRIED TO DESTROY
YOU, YUSEI.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.490
I DID SOME PRETTY
HORRIBLE THINGS.

00:16:31.157 --> 00:16:33.426
SOME TRULY
UNFORGIVABLE THINGS.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:36.762
THINGS THAT I REGRET...
BUT CAN'T TAKE BACK.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.830
KALIN...

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.966
SURE, YOU MADE SOME
PRETTY BIG MISTAKES...

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.234
BUT THAT'S DONE!

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:44.837
THE DARKNESS IS GONE
NOW--I SAW IT LEAVE!

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:48.107
Yusei: ATTACK!

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.112
Kalin: YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GO AND DO
SOMETHING STUPID, LIKE...

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:57.483
LOSE TO THE DARK SIGNERS...
ARE YOU?

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:03.756
DON'T BACK DOWN, YUSEI...
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:07.126
PUSH THE SHADOWS
BACK WHERE THEY BELONG.

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:13.232
Yusei: KALIN...

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.771
I'M SO SORRY, YUSEI.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.340
I TRIED TO FORGET
THE PAST BUT...

00:17:22.008 --> 00:17:23.409
BUT WHAT?

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:24.677
BUT EVEN THOUGH
IT LOOKED LIKE

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:26.812
THE DARKNESS
SCATTERED AWAY...

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.248
IT'S STILL
VERY MUCH WITH ME.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:32.285
ONLY NOW, IT DOESN'T
TEMPT ME TO BE WICKED.

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:34.020
IT MAKES ME WANT
SOMETHING ELSE,

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.656
SOMETHING I LONG FOR
DAY AND NIGHT.

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:39.191
YUSEI...WHAT
I LONG FOR...

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.228
IS TO PAY FOR
ALL MY WRONGDOINGS.

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:43.329
STOP IT!

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:46.032
KALIN, YOU'VE
SUFFERED ENOUGH!

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.802
NO, I HAVEN'T.
BUT I WILL.

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.105
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE ONE THAT HELPS ME.

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:55.341
WAIT. ME?

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.802
YOU'RE GOING TO
HELP ME SUFFER, YUSEI...

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.171
YOU SEE...I'VE BEEN
DUELING IN THESE PARTS

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:26.706
FOR AWHILE NOW...

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:29.542
WAITING TO LOSE SO THAT
I COULD MEET MY FATE.

00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:33.012
PROBLEM WAS...
I NEVER LOST.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:36.415
RIGHT--BECAUSE YOUR
FATE DOESN'T END HERE!

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.884
WRONG--I SURVIVED
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:41.287
BECAUSE DESTINY
WANTED YOU TO DEFEAT ME.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.189
LISTEN, KALIN,
I HAVE NO PLANS

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:45.758
TO DESTROY YOU
IN THIS DUEL OF OURS!

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.961
AND I KNOW DEEP INSIDE
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO!

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:52.131
YUSEI...THERE IS
NO DEEP INSIDE.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.499
WHAT YOU SEE...

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:56.802
IS ALL THAT'S LEFT
OF ME ANYMORE.

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:00.640
NO, DON'T SAY THAT...

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.876
DON'T SAY ANYTHING!
LET'S DUEL, NOT TALK!

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:05.478
VERY WELL THEN.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:09.181
I ACTIVATE
THE SPELL CARD ZERO-MAX!

00:19:09.849 --> 00:19:12.518
I CAN ACTIVATE IT WHEN IT'S
THE ONLY CARD IN MY HAND.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:15.921
IT LETS ME SELECT
ONE INFERNITY MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVE

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:17.390
AND SUMMON IT!

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:19.258
THEN ANY MONSTERS
WHOSE ATTACK POINTS

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.661
ARE LESS THAN MY INFERNITY'S
ARE DESTROYED.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:22.695
HUH?

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.998
NOW, APPEAR,
INFERNITY DESTROYER!

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.734
[ROARS]

00:19:29.402 --> 00:19:33.639
AND BE GONE ANY MONSTERS WITH
2300-OR-LESS ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:40.746
I CAN'T ATTACK ON THE TURN
ZERO-MAX WAS ACTIVATED...

00:19:41.414 --> 00:19:43.382
SO I END MY TURN.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.252
YA KNOW, KALIN...
IT'S INTERESTING...

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:48.354
FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS
TO LOSE SO BAD...

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:49.855
YOU CERTAINLY
ARE DUELING

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.824
WITH A WHOLE LOT
A' MIGHT.

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.528
YES...BUT SURELY YOU MUST
UNDERSTAND, YUSEI...

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.363
IF I'M GOING TO LOSE.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.900
I WANT TO TRULY LOSE
SO THAT I CAN TRULY SUFFER.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.401
I DON'T THINK SO!

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.804
I THINK YOU'RE
DUELING BECAUSE
YOU LOVE IT, KALIN!

00:20:05.471 --> 00:20:06.772
SO THERE'S HOPE!

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:11.043
IT'S MY MOVE NOW
AND I SUMMON
JUNK SYNCHRON!

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:13.312
[GRUNTS]

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.681
WHEN THIS MONSTER IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED...

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:18.484
I CAN THEN SUMMON ONE
LEVEL 2-OR-BELOW MONSTER

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.887
THAT'S RESTING
IN MY GRAVEYARD
OUT IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.423
AND THE MONSTER
I SUMMON IS...

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:26.525
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:28.461
AND SINCE JUNK SYNCHRON

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:30.329
HAPPENS TO BE
A TUNER MONSTER...

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:32.231
I CAN NOW SUMMON
BOOST WARRIOR

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.034
FROM MY HAND
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.437
NOW, LEVEL 3
JUNK SYNCHRON

00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:40.673
TUNE WITH LEVEL 2
SPEED WARRIOR...

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.043
FROM TWO COME ONE,
AND FROM ONE WILL COME
GREAT POWER!

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.312
WATCH AS THEY MERGE
THEIR MIGHT, WATCH...

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:47.680
AS I SUMMON...!

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:51.150
THE SYNCHRO MONSTER,
JUNK WARRIOR!

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:55.755
AND WHEN JUNK WARRIOR
IS SUCCESSFULLY
SYNCHRO SUMMONED,

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.524
HIS ATTACK POINTS
INCREASE BY THE TOTAL
ATTACK POINTS

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.593
OF ALL LEVEL
3-OR-BELOW MONSTERS

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.328
THAT ARE OUT
ON MY FIELD!

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:06.332
SO THAT MEANS HE GETS
300 FROM BOOST WARRIOR!

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:10.536
NEXT I'LL PLAY
BOOST WARRIOR'S ABILITY!

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.972
IT LETS ME POWER UP
ONE WARRIOR-TYPE MONSTER

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.008
WITH 300 MORE
ATTACK POINTS!

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:19.945
NOW GO JUNK WARRIOR!

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.882
ATTACK
INFERNITY DESTROYER!

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.619
UHH!

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:28.821
OH NO--KALIN!

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:32.458
IF MY MONSTER IS DESTROYED

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.426
AND I HAVE NO CARDS
IN MY HAND...

00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:36.729
THEN I CAN SUMMON
INFERNITY AVENGER

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:38.264
FROM MY GRAVE TO THE FIELD

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.599
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.334
AND WHEN
AVENGER'S SUMMONED

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:44.003
DUE TO THIS
SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.907
HIS LEVEL CHANGES TO THAT OF
THE DESTROYED MONSTER'S.

00:21:48.574 --> 00:21:51.777
SO SINCE MY DESTROYER'S
LEVEL WAS 6...

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:54.780
AVENGER'S LEVEL IS NOW 6.

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.586
I'M DOWN TO 900
LIFE POINTS, YUSEI...

00:22:01.253 --> 00:22:02.288
WHICH MEANS...

00:22:02.955 --> 00:22:05.257
ONE MORE ATTACK
AND I'LL BE DONE FOR.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.294
I'M GLAD YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO'LL FINISH ME, YUSEI.

00:22:08.961 --> 00:22:10.229
IT REALLY IS FITTING.

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.865
KALIN! YOU'RE STILL
TALKING NONSENSE--

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.099
NOW CUT IT OUT!

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:15.968
IT'S TRUE, FRIEND.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:19.538
AT LONG LAST, THE END
IS FINALLY NEAR.

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:21.073
PLEASE BELIEVE ME
WHEN I SAY

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.010
THAT I'M SORRY FOR ALL
THE HARM THAT I'VE CAUSED.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.379
LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT.

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:31.283
NOW LET'S LET FATE
RUN ITS COURSE, SHALL WE?

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:34.186
KALIN...
