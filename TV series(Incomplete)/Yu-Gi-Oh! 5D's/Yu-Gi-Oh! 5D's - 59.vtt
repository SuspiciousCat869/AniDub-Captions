00:08:55.985 --> 00:08:59.322
NEXT I'LL SUMMON
DARK RESONATOR
FROM MY HAND!

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:04.060
AND AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE,

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.063
IT RESONATES QUITE NICELY
WITH MY VICE DRAGON.

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:09.232
THAT'S RIGHT.
LEVEL 3 DARK RESONATOR

00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:11.567
TUNES LEVEL 5 VICE DRAGON

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:15.571
AND SYNCHRO
SUMMONS THE RAVENOUS
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:18.574
[ROARING]

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.510
QUITE A MIGHTY
BEAST.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.612
IN FACT, A PERSONAL
FAVORITE OF MINE.

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.047
A SHAME THAT HE WON'T
BE STAYING FOR TOO LONG.

00:09:25.047 --> 00:09:27.049
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP...

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:28.684
CLASS CHANGE!

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:31.087
IT INCREASES
MY FORTUNE LADY EARTH'S
LEVEL BY ONE!

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:33.022
AND SINCE
HER LEVEL INCREASED,

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:34.524
SHE ALSO GAINS
400 ATTACK POINTS,

00:09:34.524 --> 00:09:37.226
MAKING HER STRONGER
THAN YOUR DRAGON.

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:38.795
[DARK CARLY
LAUGHS SINISTERLY]

00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:41.197
BUT AS GOOD AS
HER FIRST SPECIAL
ABILITY IS, JACKIE,

00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:43.633
HER SECOND ONE
IS EVEN BETTER.

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:46.936
IT DEALS 400 POINTS
OF DIRECT DAMAGE TO YOU!

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:49.038
LET HIM HAVE IT!

00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:57.313
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:57.313 --> 00:10:00.783
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE LIKE THE FLAME ON
A FLICKERING CANDLE!

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:04.086
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME BEFORE
THE DARKNESS TAKES HOLD.

00:10:04.086 --> 00:10:05.555
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:06.689
I THINK I'LL BUY
SOME MORE TIME.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.691
GO SPEED SPELL
HALF SEEDS!

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:11.394
NOW SINCE I HAVE 3
OR MORE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.329
HALF OF YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK
POINTS ARE DEDUCTED

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:15.865
AND ADDED
TO MY LIFE POINTS!

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:21.170
AND THAT MEANS
MY ARCHFIEND IS

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.105
BACK ON TOP OF
THE FOOD CHAIN.

00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:24.373
A LUCKY MOVE!

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.275
SORRY, BUT MY FLAME?

00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:28.277
IT'S NOT BURNING
OUT ANYTIME SOON.

00:10:28.277 --> 00:10:30.680
IN FACT, THINGS
ARE ABOUT TO GET
REALLY FIRED UP!

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.949

ME THAT RELEASED CARLY.

SOMEWHERE.

I JUST DON'T GET IT.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.546
SOME MYSTERY MAN SAVES ME
FROM A GANG OF GRABBY GHOULS

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:05.848
AND THEN VANISHES
WITHOUT A TRACE?

WITHOUT ANY TRACE.

COMING FROM?

OH, WELL.

00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:31.641
LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
THE END OF THE ROAD.

00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:36.545
NO. THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING
FOR YOU, YUSEI.

00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:38.681
WHY'D YOU SAVE ME FROM
THOSE SPIRITS EARLIER?

00:11:38.714 --> 00:11:40.283
WHO ARE YOU?

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.351
WHO AM I?

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:47.056
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL
ME YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR OWN DAD?

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.025

00:11:49.025 --> 00:11:52.128
LISTEN TO ME, YUSEI.
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:55.431
THERE IS STILL MUCH
FOR YOU TO DO BACK IN
THE SATELLITE SECTOR.

DO YOU MEAN?

FOR GREAT THINGS.

TO THAT GREATNESS IF
YOU ARE TO ACHIEVE THEM.

A BREAK, WOULD YOU?

TO SPARE!

BETTER GET A MOVE ON!

PLAY A FACE-DOWN.

SOMETHING. BUT WHAT?

THAN EVER.

AND I COULD LOSE
HER FOR GOOD!

OF INHERIT FORTUNE,

00:13:56.052 --> 00:13:58.454

IT ALLOWS ME TO DRAW
ONE CARD FOR EVERY
FORTUNE LADY ON MY FIELD.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.402
AND SINCE I CURRENTLY
HAVE TWO, IT LOOKS LIKE

00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:15.638
YOU'RE IN DOUBLE TROUBLE!

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.355
AND YOU'LL HAVE
YOUR ANSWER.

MANIFESTATION OF
WHAT WILL BE

WHEN ALL THE SPIRITS
OF THE SATELLITE ARE
SWALLOWED BY DARKNESS!

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.236
Jack, thinking:
SOUNDS LIKE I'M ABOUT
TO GET A SNEAK PREVIEW

00:14:47.236 --> 00:14:50.339
OF WHAT'S TO COME
SHOULD THE DARK SIGNERS
GET THEIR WAY.

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:52.341
I SEE THE FEAR
IN YOUR EYES.

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:54.009
AND YOU ARE WISE
TO TREMBLE.

THIS IS BUT A TASTE OF
WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD
HAS TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

00:15:32.044 --> 00:15:36.115
NOW PREPARE TO FEEL
THE WRATH OF THE SHADOWS!

00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:37.983
Jack, thinking: IF
THAT BEHEMOTH STRIKES
ME, I'M DONE FOR.

00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:39.418
THERE'S ONLY ONE CHANCE.

SUMMONED WHENEVER

AND THANKS TO ITS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:49.795

PHASE ENDS AND YOUR
ATTACK IS CANCELED.

GUESS I'LL JUST SETTLE
FOR A FACE-DOWN, THEN.

WILL BE YOUR LAST!

BECAUSE YOU HAD

MEANS SOMETHING TO!

AT FIRST,

BUT SHE MADE ME
BELIEVE IN MYSELF!

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.060
WHEN SHE DID,
I COULD BELIEVE
IN OTHERS.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.630
BY REACHING ME,
CARLY REACHED
SO VERY MANY OF US.

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:29.969
AND I CAN FEEL EVERY
LAST ONE OF THEM
WITH ME RIGHT NOW!

THE SHADOWS
ON YOUR SIDE,

BUT I HAVE
THE LIGHT.

00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:38.310

THEIR POWER INSIDE ME.

I CAN FEEL THEIR STRENGTH.

TELLING ME TO PUT IT
TO GOOD USE!

SO LET'S!

USE THIS, THEN...

IS THAT YOU?

00:17:19.018 --> 00:17:21.820
YES, I'M HERE.

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:25.291
YOU MUST LISTEN
CAREFULLY.

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:26.792
OF COURSE!

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:29.528
YOU'VE DONE ALL YOU CAN,
BUT IT'S TIME
YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME.

00:17:29.528 --> 00:17:30.996
DON'T SAY THAT!

00:17:30.996 --> 00:17:33.199
NOW YOU MUST DO WHAT
YOU CAN TO SAVE THE WORLD.

00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:35.167
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE NOT TO!

00:17:35.167 --> 00:17:36.635

00:17:36.635 --> 00:17:38.737
JUST HOLD ON.
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO SAVE YOU YET!

00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:42.441
NO. YOU HAVE TO WIN
THIS DUEL AND WIN IT NOW!

00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:45.711
BUT IF I ATTACK,
THEN YOU'LL BE LOST
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.081
AND IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL STILL BE UNDER
THE DARK SIGNERS' CONTROL.

00:17:49.081 --> 00:17:51.884
SHOULD THE DARKNESS
WIN THIS MATCH, A LOT
OF PEOPLE WILL BE ABSORBED

00:17:51.884 --> 00:17:53.986
INTO THE SHADOWS.

00:17:53.986 --> 00:17:56.488
YOU MUST DO THIS FOR ME.

00:17:58.257 --> 00:18:03.762
CARLY, IF THESE
ARE YOUR WISHES,
THEN VERY WELL.

00:18:03.762 --> 00:18:06.232
I'LL DO AS YOU SAY.

NOW THEN LET'S GIVE IT
TO THOSE DARK SIGNERS!

NO PROBLEM!

00:18:28.287 --> 00:18:29.922
BECAUSE

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.127
TUNED UP AND TRICKED
OUT TO SYNCHRO SUMMON

00:18:35.127 --> 00:18:37.963
SOMETHING THAT
HAS SOME SERIOUS BITE!

00:18:37.963 --> 00:18:40.766
THAT'S RIGHT.
FROM OUT OF THESE
THREE COMES ONE.

00:18:40.766 --> 00:18:43.002
AND HE'S GOT ONE THING
ON HIS MIND...

00:18:43.002 --> 00:18:44.470
TAKING YOU DOWN!

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.273
I GIVE YOU THE MAJESTIC
RED DRAGON!

00:18:47.273 --> 00:18:51.110
Duel runner computer: WHEN
MAJESTIC RED DRAGON ATTACKS,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.346
ALL MONSTERS ON THE FIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE ARE DESTROYED

00:18:54.346 --> 00:18:57.416
AFTER THE BATTLE.

00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.917
AND THE SAVING
STARTS NOW

00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:00.352
BECAUSE MAJESTIC
RED DRAGON

00:19:00.352 --> 00:19:02.554
NEGATES THE ABILITY
OF YOUR MONSTER!

00:19:02.554 --> 00:19:04.590
AND THEN HE GAINS
THE ATTACK POINTS
OF THOSE MONSTERS

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.392
UNTIL THE END
OF THE TURN!

00:19:06.392 --> 00:19:08.193
IN OTHER WORDS,
THE ALMIGHTY POWER

00:19:08.193 --> 00:19:13.966
OF YOUR EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL ASLLA PISCU
IS NOW MINE

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:17.670
AND TO THE TUNE OF
6,500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.105
YOU WON'T ATTACK ME.
YOU'LL HURT LITTLE CARLY!

00:19:20.105 --> 00:19:23.075
YOU'RE RIGHT.
AND I WON'T LET HER
MAKE THAT SACRIFICE!

00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:25.044
Jack, thinking:
AT LEAST NOT ALONE,

00:19:25.044 --> 00:19:26.979
WHICH IS
WHY I STILL HAVE
A FACE-DOWN TO PLAY.

00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:29.415
SHOCKWAVE.

00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:31.350
WHEN IT'S ACTIVATED,
IF A MONSTER ON THE
FIELD IS DESTROYED,

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.985
THEN BOTH PLAYERS
TAKE DAMAGE

00:19:32.985 --> 00:19:34.787
EQUAL TO
THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:19:34.787 --> 00:19:36.288
AND SINCE I CAN
USE SHOCKWAVE

00:19:36.288 --> 00:19:38.257
TO DESTROY MAJESTIC
RED DRAGON,

00:19:38.257 --> 00:19:40.025
CARLY AND I
WOULD BOTH TAKE
ENOUGH DAMAGE

00:19:40.025 --> 00:19:42.628
TO LOSE THIS DUEL
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:44.797
IT'S WHAT
MUST BE DONE.

00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:47.900
WE'LL BE TOGETHER
AGAIN SOON, CARLY,
NOT THE WAY I HAD HOPED,

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.003
BUT TOGETHER NONETHELESS,
AND THAT'S THE ONLY
THING THAT MATTERS!

00:19:53.172 --> 00:19:54.940
OH, JACK, YOU'RE WRONG.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.211
YOU HAVE ANOTHER DESTINY
IN STORE. REMEMBER?

00:20:01.013 --> 00:20:03.382
NO, CARLY,
IT'S ALREADY DONE!

00:20:03.382 --> 00:20:06.118
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP...
EARTHBOUND RELEASE!

00:20:06.118 --> 00:20:08.754
WHAT?! BUT...

00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:10.255
Dark Carly:
WITH THIS IN PLAY,

00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:11.857
ALL MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD
ARE DESTROYED!

00:20:11.857 --> 00:20:14.793
AND THEN YOU TAKE
DAMAGE EQUAL TO ALL
THEIR ATTACK POINTS!

00:20:14.793 --> 00:20:18.097
IN OTHER WORDS,
JACKIE, YOU'VE LOST!

00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.916
FACE IT, JACKIE,
YOU'VE LOST.

00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:36.384
WITH EARTHBOUND
RELEASE OUT,

00:20:36.384 --> 00:20:37.852
ALL MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD
ARE DESTROYED

00:20:37.852 --> 00:20:39.987
AND YOU TAKE
THEIR ATTACK POINTS
AS DAMAGE!

00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:42.089
YOU'RE WRONG! MY DRAGON'S
ABILITY IS STILL IN PLAY,

00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:45.126
SO YOUR EFFECT IS
NEGATED AND YOU TAKE
THE DAMAGE, NOT ME!

00:20:45.126 --> 00:20:48.095
BUT WHY WOULD YOU MAKE
SUCH A CARELESS MOVE UNLESS...

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:49.730
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
IT'S CARLY!

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.633
SHE MUST HAVE USED
THE LAST BIT OF STRENGTH
SHE HAD TO FORCE

00:20:52.633 --> 00:20:55.469
YOUR HAND AND SAVE ME.

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:06.414
Carly:
I TOLD YOU, JACK,

00:21:06.414 --> 00:21:08.015
YOU HAVE ANOTHER
DESTINY IN STORE
FOR YOU.

00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:10.084
AND AS MUCH
AS I APPRECIATE YOU
WILLING TO SACRIFICE

00:21:10.084 --> 00:21:12.820
EVERYTHING FOR ME,
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU FULFILL IT!

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.024
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE KING, JACK!

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:24.565
CARLY!

00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:30.404
AAH!

00:21:32.373 --> 00:21:35.076
Mina: THE GEOGLYPH
IS DISAPPEARING.

00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:36.744
THE DUEL MUST BE OVER.

00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:42.483
AND IT LOOKS AS
THOUGH JACK'S WON.

00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:44.485
ALL RIGHT! I KNEW
THAT HE'D DO IT!

00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:48.956
Mina, thinking:
HOW COULD HE NOT?
HE'S THE BEST THERE IS.

00:21:48.956 --> 00:21:52.360
CARLY! CARLY!

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.961
JUST HANG
IN THERE, CARLY.

00:21:53.961 --> 00:21:55.429
YOU HEAR ME?

00:21:55.463 --> 00:21:58.032
YES, JACK. I HEAR YOU.

00:21:58.032 --> 00:21:59.667
YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT THROUGH THIS!

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.435
I KNOW, JACK.

00:22:01.469 --> 00:22:03.337
I WILL BUT NOT HERE.

00:22:03.337 --> 00:22:06.374
NO, DON'T SAY THAT. LOOK,
I SAVED THESE FOR YOU.

00:22:12.046 --> 00:22:13.748
THANKS, JACK.

00:22:13.748 --> 00:22:15.349
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:17.485
EVEN THOUGH THE NETHERWORLD
IS CALLING FOR ME,

00:22:17.485 --> 00:22:19.353
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

00:22:19.353 --> 00:22:21.989
I'M NOT SCARED, AND
YOU SHOULDN'T BE EITHER.

00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:24.392
WE'LL BE TOGETHER
AGAIN SOMEDAY.

00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:26.060
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.995
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO BRING YOU BACK.

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:29.730
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP HOPE,

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.600
AND I'LL NEVER STOP
FIGHTING FOR YOU, CARLY.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.101
I KNOW, JACK.

00:22:34.101 --> 00:22:35.436
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

00:22:35.469 --> 00:22:37.004
MY NUMBER ONE.

00:22:37.004 --> 00:22:38.372
NOW THEN I'M AFRAID

00:22:38.372 --> 00:22:40.374
IT'S TIME
I GET GOING.

00:22:43.644 --> 00:22:46.280
GOOD-BYE, JACK.

00:22:55.623 --> 00:22:57.191
CARLY?

00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:09.103
I WON'T EVER FORGET
EVERYTHING
YOU DID FOR ME.

00:23:09.103 --> 00:23:12.406
AND I WON'T
FORGET YOU, JACK.

00:23:12.406 --> 00:23:17.144
YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU
I'D BE ALL RIGHT.

00:23:22.983 --> 00:23:24.919
Crow: CHECK IT
OUT, YUSEI!

00:23:24.919 --> 00:23:27.188
DO YOU THINK
THIS MEANS THAT
JACK WON HIS DUEL?

00:23:27.188 --> 00:23:28.956
YEAH, SURE
IT DOES!

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:32.159
THEN THERE'S JUST ONE
TOWER LEFT TO SEAL.

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:33.761
AND I HAVE A BAD
FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE

00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:36.030
THE MOST DIFFICULT
ONE OF THEM ALL.
