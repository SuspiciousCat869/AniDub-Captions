WEBVTT

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.136
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S."

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:05.906
I PLAY JUNK ARCHER'S
ABILITY.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.842
IT TAKES YOUR PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.745
AND REMOVES IT FROM
THE DUEL.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.747
UH...

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.249
Lester: WHAT GIVES?

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.551
SINCE IT WAS TWO SIGNERS THAT
JUST DUELED IT OUT,

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.487
I THOUGHT FOR SURE THAT
THE CIRCUIT WOULD ACTIVATE.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:21.822
Jakob: PATIENCE, LESTER.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.992
FOR WHAT WE ARE PLANNING,
GREAT POWER IS REQUIRED.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.361
THEN ALL THE CIRCUITS
WILL BE ACTIVATED,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.665
AND OUR GRAND DESIGN WILL,
AT LONG LAST, BE REALIZED.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.102
Lester: IT'S HERE.
MY STONE TABLET.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.570
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:40.207
PRIMO DOESN'T GET TO HAVE ALL
THE FUN BY HIMSELF.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.109
TODAY, WE HAVE
A NEW CLASSMATE

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.477
THAT I'M GOING
TO INTRODUCE YOU TO.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:44.678
MEET LESTER.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.281
HI, EVERYONE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:48.882
HE'S DREAMY.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.150
Luna: LESTER.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.153
HEY, I WAS WONDERING,
WHAT ARE YA UP TO AFTER SCHOOL?

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.888
UM, TODAY?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:56.757
SHE'S
UP TO STUFF
WITHOUT YOU.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.725
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
WANTED TO HANG OUT.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:00.360
CAN'T YA
TAKE A HINT?
SHOO.

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.129
YOU COULD EVEN
COME TO MY HOUSE.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.966
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU.
REALLY?

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.571
OH! WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:14.207
YEAH.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:16.810
[THINKING]
I GOTTA TELL
THE GUYS ABOUT THIS.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.413
A DUEL BOARD?
YEAH.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.647
SO THEN WITH
THIS DEVICE,

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:21.982
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO
USE A DUEL RUNNER

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.550
TO BATTLE IT OUT
IN A TURBO DUEL.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.085
IT LOOKS
SIMPLE ENOUGH.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:26.253
IN FACT, I'LL BET
WE HAVE THE PARTS

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.055
TO PUT ONE TOGETHER
RIGHT HERE.

00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.424
TIME TO TEST
THIS BAD BOY OUT.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:31.892
HA HA HA!

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.695
LUNA, HOW'D YA FIND ME?

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.597
YUSEI TOLD ME WHAT
YOU WERE UP TO,

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:38.899
THAT YOU'RE TRAINING
TO TAKE ON LESTER.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.668
YEAH, SO LEMME GUESS, YOU'RE
HERE TO TRY AND STOP ME.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:44.271
STOP YOU FROM TRAINING
BY YOURSELF, THAT IS.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.307
I THOUGHT I'D TRAIN
WITH YOU.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:49.843
HUH? WHO IS THAT?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.244
[THINKING]
I'M TIRED OF WAITING.

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:53.280
I'M GOING TO DUEL
A SIGNER,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.149
AND I'M GOING
TO DUEL HER NOW.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.553
Leo: HEY, WHOEVER YOU ARE,
HOW 'BOUT YOU TAKE ME ON, TOO?

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:02.289
IF THAT'S WHAT IT'S
GONNA TAKE TO DO THIS.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.558
Leo: HE JUST SUMMONED
FIVE MONSTERS AT ONCE.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.560
DO YOUR THING,
MACHINE EMPEROR.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.829
NOW FIVE MONSTERS
HAVE BECOME ONE.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.398
FEEL BETTER?
NOT REALLY...

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:14.935

SO WHAT IF IT'S TWO ON ONE?

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.539
YOU'RE STILL NO MATCH
FOR MY ULTIMATE MONSTER,

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.874
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.877
YOU'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH
HOW HE STEALS THE SHOW.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:34.881
LESTER CERTAINLY
IS SURE OF HIMSELF.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.918
LET'S HOPE
IT DOESN'T COST HIM
THE DUEL OR WORSE.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.087
LESTER KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING,

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:44.091
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN
SAY FOR YOU SOMETIMES.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.597
WHOEVER THIS GUY IS,
HE SURE SEEMS PUMPED

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.267
ABOUT THAT MONSTER OF HIS, BUT
I CAN'T LET THAT SCARE ME OFF.

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:58.605
I HAVE TO PROTECT LUNA,
NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHAT.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.374
[CHIRPS]

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:02.876
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
KURIBON?

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:04.144
Regulus:
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, LUNA.

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.445
REGULUS?

00:04:06.113 --> 00:04:07.581
HE'S FRIGHTENED,
AND SO AM I.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.584
BUT WHAT OF?

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.320
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN'T
ALL TAKE ON, RIGHT?

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.123
Yusei: FASTER, JACK. FASTER.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:21.094
[THINKING]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY MARK'S
TRYING TO TELL ME,

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:24.464
BUT I DO KNOW IT'S ABOUT LUNA
AND THAT IT'S NOT GOOD.

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.967
I JUST HOPE WE CAN REACH HER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.002
Crow:
MIND IF WE
TAG ALONG?

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.406
WELL, NOW. IF IT ISN'T
CROW AND AKIZA.

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.910
ALL RIGHT. WE'VE GOT
REINFORCEMENTS, YUSEI.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.647
[THINKING]
GOOD 'CAUSE I THINK
WE'LL NEED THEM.

00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:00.534
YOU TWO CAN'T KEEP UP IN THIS
DUEL OR ON THESE DUEL BOARDS.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.202
HA HA HA!

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.438
UGH! WE'LL JUST
SEE ABOUT THAT.
I DRAW.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:06.907
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT!

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:08.809
WITH THIS, IF I'M
ATTACKED DIRECTLY,

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.144
I'LL BE ABLE
TO SUMMON OUT
A MONSTER.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.114
I'LL PLAY ONE FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:18.084
MY MOVE, THEN. HA!

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.621
FIRST, I PLAY MY
FACEDOWN--TRAP STUN.

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.025
NOW NO TRAPS CAN BE USED
FOR THE REST OF THIS TURN,

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:26.827
AND SINCE THEY CAN'T,

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:32.132
MY MACHINE EMPEROR SKIEL
CAN ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.969
UHH...

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:38.505
LEO!

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:42.676
HUH!
AH...

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:43.844
HOPE YOU
ENJOYED THAT

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:45.345
'CAUSE MY MACHINE
EMPEROR SKIEL'S

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.280
ONLY JUST STARTING
TO GEAR UP.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.616
HIS TRUE TALENTS HAVE
YET TO BE REVEALED...

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:51.985
HA HA HA!

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.454
BUT FOR NOW, I'LL LEAVE
THINGS WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.791
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU
REGRETTING THAT YOU
HURT MY BROTHER.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:03.597
HAH! I SUMMON
SUNLIGHT UNICORN.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.569
THEN, FROM MY GRAVEYARD,
I ACTIVATE THE ABILITY
OF SPORE.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:12.572
NOW, BY REMOVING NETTLES
IN MY GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.842
I CAN SUMMON SPORE
OUT TO THE FIELD,

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.310
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.779
NOW I CAN TAKE
THE LEVEL OF THE CARD
I JUST REMOVED

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:22.716
AND ADD IT ON
TO SPORE'S LEVEL.

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:27.821
NEXT, I'LL TUNE MY LEVEL 3 SPORE
WITH MY LEVEL 4 SUNLIGHT UNICORN

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.056
AND LET THE MAGIC THAT LIVES
IN EACH OF THESE CREATURES

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:31.925
MERGE AND BECOME ONE.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:33.293
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.396
I SYNCHRO SUMMON THE MIGHTY,
THE MAJESTIC--

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.798
THE ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:42.035
[ROARS]

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:43.970
[THINKING]
AT LAST, IT'S HERE.

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:49.643
YOU SEE? LESTER HAS EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.846
Luna: NOW, THANKS TO
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON,

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:57.017
I CAN SUMMON A LEVEL
4-OR-BELOW MONSTER
FROM MY HAND ONCE PER TURN,

00:06:57.684 --> 00:06:58.652
AND FOR THIS FIRST TURN,

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.123
THE MONSTER I CHOOSE TO SUMMON
IS THE FAIRY ARCHER...

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.797
AND WHEN SHE DRAWS BACK HER BOW,
YOU BETTER LOOK OUT

00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:13.033
BECAUSE FOR EVERY
LIGHT ATTRIBUTE MONSTER

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.601
THAT'S OUT ON MY FIELD
AND FACE UP,

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.704
FAIRY ARCHER DEALS 400 POINTS
OF DAMAGE TO YOU.

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:21.675
AND LUNA'S GOT TWO OF THEM,
SO THAT'S 800 POINTS.

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:28.148
Luna: LET HIM HAVE IT,
FAIRY ARCHER.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.681
AAH!

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:35.221
OOH.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.293
HEH HEH HEH!

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:43.396
WAIT. SO WE FEEL DAMAGE,
BUT HE DOESN'T?

00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:44.998
YEAH. IT LOOKS
THAT WAY.

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:46.700
HEY, THANKS A LOT
FOR THAT.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.069
I'M ALWAYS IN THE MOOD
FOR A GOOD TICKLE.

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:52.172
HA HA HA!

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.009
Luna: I PLACE TWO CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:00.714
Crow: WHOA, MUST BE A DUEL
GOIN' ON.

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:03.283
Akiza: HEY, HAVEN'T YOU
DUELED THAT MONSTER, YUSEI?

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.752
REMEMBER?
WITH THE GHOST?

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:07.654
NO, IT WAS
A DIFFERENT TYPE,

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.189
BUT THERE ARE
SIMILARITIES,

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:10.857
LIKE THAT MARK
ON ITS CHEST.

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:12.926
THEY MUST ALL BE PART
OF THE SAME GROUP.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:14.361
WHADAYA SAYIN',

00:08:15.028 --> 00:08:17.564
THAT THERE'S A WHOLE
FAMILY OF THOSE
THINGS OUT THERE?

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.834
LOOK. IT'S THEM.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:22.202
SURE IS.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:25.005
SO THE TWINS ARE DUELING
AGAINST THAT MONSTROSITY?

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.974
Lester: AND NOW THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.578
READY OR NOT...

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.915
HERE COMES
MACHINE EMPEROR'S ABILITY.

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.018
YOU SEE, ONCE PER TURN,
MY EMPEROR SKIEL

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.220
IS ALLOWED TO ABSORB
ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.890
THAT'S OVER ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.227
THAT THING CAN ABSORB
SYNCHRO MONSTERS?

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.629
UH-OH. WE'RE IN FOR IT.

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:53.233
THIS IS BAD.
IT'S LIKE BEFORE.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.904
[ROARS]

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.706
Luna:
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON!

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.107
[THINKING]
ANCIENT IS RIGHT 'CAUSE

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.243
FROM THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
IT'S HISTORY.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.478
[ROARS]

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.615
OH, NO.
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.451
STOP IT. LET MY SISTER'S
MONSTER GO NOW.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:14.621
Lester:
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.861
HMM...

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.333
NO. MY ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON
IS INSIDE THAT THING.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.769
THIS IS AWFUL.
WE'RE TOO LATE.

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:31.738
HA HA HA!

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.074
THAT'S HOW MY MONSTER
STEALS THE SHOW,

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.475
'CAUSE HE STEALS SYNCHROS.

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:39.712
UGH, WHO IS THIS GUY?
WHY'S HE DOING THIS TO US?

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.548
HUH?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.788
HUH?

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.991
HA HA HA!

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.268
IT'S LESTER.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.538
LUNA! THAT GUY,
IT'S LESTER.

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:07.841
WHAT? YOU MEAN
FROM SCHOOL?

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:11.544
THAT'S RIGHT, AND NOW I HAVE YOU
RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU...

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:15.281
[THINKING]
AND WITH A LITTLE LUCK,
I'LL SOON HAVE MUCH, MUCH MORE.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.984
[ALOUD]
NOW BACK TO THE DUEL AND TO HIM

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.120
BECAUSE, THANKS TO HIS
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:23.990
HE NOW GAINS ATTACK POINTS EQUAL
TO THAT OF YOUR SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:26.826
[ROARS]

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.663
AND I THOUGHT
THAT MONSTER
WAS TOUGH BEFORE.

00:10:31.331 --> 00:10:35.335
NEXT FROM MY HAND, I PLAY
THE SPEED SPELL SUMMON CLOSE.

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:38.738
NOW, SINCE I HAVE 4 OR MORE
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:42.308
YOU AREN'T ALLOWED
TO SPECIAL SUMMON A MONSTER
FOR THIS ENTIRE TURN.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.510
BUT THAT MEANS...

00:10:44.177 --> 00:10:45.145
THAT MEANS MACHINE EMPEROR

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:46.946
CAN ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY AGAIN,

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:49.983
AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO
A SINGLE THING ABOUT IT.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.786
SO GO ON AND
BLAST HIM ALREADY.

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.157
YAAH!

00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:59.826
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP
TWINKLE WALL.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.095
THANKS TO THIS CARD,
BY TAKING DAMAGE

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.531
EQUAL TO HALF OF YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS,

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:08.201
I CAN CANCEL OUT
YOUR ASSAULT.

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:12.505
UH!

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.807
LUNA!

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.912
UH! OH!

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.381
[THINKING] PROTECTING LEO THERE
WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO.

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.384
AFTER ALL, IT'S MY FAULT
WE'RE IN THIS MESS WITH LESTER.

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.487
I ONLY HOPE I DON'T GET
ANYONE ELSE HURT.

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:36.029
[THINKING]
THAT'S IT, LUNA.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:37.697
KEEP DUELING
WITH ALL YOUR HEART.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.700
[ALOUD] I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN.

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:44.070
MY MOVE NOW.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:48.208
[THINKING] TIME FOR A LITTLE
PAYBACK FOR HOW LESTER
EMBARRASSED ME IN DUEL P.E.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:52.679
[ALOUD]
I SUMMON MORPHTRONIC SCOPEN.

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:01.521
AND NOW, SINCE SCOPEN IS OUT
ON THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE,

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:03.890
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON ANOTHER
MORPHTRONIC MONSTER

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.826
TO THE FIELD AND
A LEVEL 4 ONE AT THAT.

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.061
SO LET'S GET TO IT.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.397
COME ON OUT,
MORPHTRONIC BOOMBOXEN.

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.138
AND NOW I'LL TUNE
THE LEVEL 3 SCOPEN

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:22.842
WITH THE LEVEL 4 BOOMBOXEN.

00:12:27.614 --> 00:12:28.314
AH, YEAH.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:30.984
WHEN MORPHTRONIC'S MORPH,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:32.652
IT'S A SYNCHRO THING.

00:12:33.319 --> 00:12:36.589
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE POWER TOOL DRAGON.

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.327
ANOTHER SYNCHRO? HEH.

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:44.130
YOU SIMPLY DON'T
LEARN, DO YOU?

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:46.599
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO TEACH YOU.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.534
HA HA HA!

00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:52.372
HA HA HA!

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:09.389
WHAT'S LEO THINKING?

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:12.358
HIS SYNCHRO MONSTER WON'T
STAND A CHANCE AGAINST
MACHINE EMPEROR.

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:13.459
LEO!

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.429
DON'T WORRY, LUNA.
I'M ON THIS. WATCH.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:18.364
I PLAY SUMMON SPEEDER.

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:21.434
THANKS TO THIS SPELL, WHEN I
HAVE 4 OR MORE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:24.304
I CAN SUMMON A LEVEL 4-OR-BELOW
MONSTER FROM MY HAND,

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:25.905
AND THE MONSTER
I'LL BE SUMMONING

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:30.677
IS LEVEL 1 MORPHTRONIC VACUUMEN
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:33.713
Duel Runner Computer:
WHEN THE MACHINE TYPE MONSTER
MORPHTRONIC VACUUMEN

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.682
IS IN DEFENSE MODE,
IT CAN EQUIP

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:38.951
AN OPPONENT'S MONSTER
ONCE PER TURN.

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:40.386
SO GET READY, LESTER,

00:13:41.054 --> 00:13:43.389
BECAUSE THIS BAD BOY IS ABOUT
TO HELP ME CLEAN HOUSE.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:44.424
I SEE.

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:46.492
LEO'S GONNA TAKE DOWN
MACHINE EMPEROR,

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.662
AND THEN HE'LL BE ABLE
TO ATTACK DIRECTLY
WITH POWER TOOL DRAGON.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.700
GO, VACUUMEN.
TIME TO DO WHAT
YOU DO BEST.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:02.575
I PLAY A FACEDOWN--
THE TRAP CONVERT GHOST.

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:04.544
NOW WHEN A MONSTER ON MY FIELD
IS SELECTED

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:06.346
AS THE TARGET OF AN EFFECT,

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.482
THE TARGET IS SWITCHED TO
A MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.317
OHH!

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.092
OH, NO! LEO!

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:22.895
PLEASE. I KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE UP TO THAT WHOLE TIME.

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:26.733
YOU'RE AS PREDICTABLE
AS YOUR SISTER.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.669
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:33.539
MY MOVE. DRAW.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.241
HOLD ON A SEC,
LESTER.

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.043
TELL ME IF THIS
IS PREDICTABLE.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.878
I PLAY POWER BREAK.

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.547
THANKS TO THIS TRAP, SINCE
MY DRAGON'S OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.585
ALL EQUIPPED AND ABSORBED CARDS
ALSO OUT ON THE FIELD ARE
RETURNED TO THEIR DECKS.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.855
WHAT?
THAT'S RIGHT,
BUT THERE'S MORE.

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:52.592
YOU TAKE 500 POINTS
OF DAMAGE FOR EACH
RETURNED CARD,

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:57.130
ONE OF WHICH BEING
A CERTAIN SYNCHRO
MONSTER YOU SWIPED.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.440
[ROARS]

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.810
ANCIENT FAIRY
DRAGON'S BACK.

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:11.911
AH.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.547
[ROARS]

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:23.823
NNGH!

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.191
RRGH!

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.427
Leo: I WARNED YA
TO STAY AWAY FROM
MY SISTER, LESTER,

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.462
BUT YOU
WOULDN'T LISTEN.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.198
WELL, NOW YOU SEE,
NOT ONLY AM I GONNA
PROTECT HER

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.234
WITH ALL OF
MY MIGHT, BUT I'LL
ALSO DO ALL I CAN

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.904
TO PROTECT
THE THINGS
THAT SHE HOLDS DEAR.

00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:39.305
DON'T MESS
WITH MY SISTER.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.275
LEO...

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:45.978
YIKES, REMIND ME TO BE EXTRA
NICE TO LUNA FROM NOW ON.

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:47.013
NO JOKE.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.548
I'VE NEVER SEEN LEO
SO FIRED UP

00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:50.683
OR SO ON TOP
OF HIS DUEL GAME.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.419
SAME HERE.
YEAH.

00:15:54.086 --> 00:15:57.924
DISCONCERTING,
BUT THIS DUEL ISN'T OVER YET.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.127
Lester: THAT'S IT.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:02.628
HUH!

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:05.164
SO YA WANNA PLAY ROUGH?

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:07.767
THEN LET'S PLAY ROUGH,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.435
I'M NOT GONNA PICK
ON LITTLE SIS ANYMORE.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:11.337
I'M GONNA PICK ON YOU.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:13.906
I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:19.812
NOW, BY REMOVING 7 SPEED
COUNTERS, I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.549
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
MY FACEDOWN SKY A3.

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:26.552
THANKS TO THIS TRAP, BY SENDING
A MONSTER ON MY FIELD

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.387
WITH "SKIEL A" IN ITS NAME
TO THE GRAVE,

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:32.992
I CAN SUMMON SKIEL A3
FROM MY HAND.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.103
HIS MONSTER
JUST POWERED UP.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.972
BUT I'M NOT DONE.

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.007
NOW, BY RELEASING SKIEL A3,

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.211
I CAN NOW SUMMON SKIEL A5
FROM MY HAND.

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:00.720
THAT'S TWO POWER UPS
IN A ROW.

00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:04.423
NEXT, I ACTIVATE THE ABILITY
OF SKIEL A5.

00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:09.262
IT ALLOWS MACHINE EMPEROR SKIEL
TO ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY.

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.903
NOW, THIS IS PLAYING ROUGH.

00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:19.272
OH...

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.141
[EXPLOSION]

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:25.811
AAH!

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:28.681
WHOA!

00:17:31.851 --> 00:17:34.186
NO!

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:36.522
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:38.391
AAH!
AAH!

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:43.029
[MOANING]

00:17:48.134 --> 00:17:49.835
HUH?

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:52.305
HUH.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:54.640
AH.

00:17:55.808 --> 00:17:56.876
HUH?

00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.278
HUH?

00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.483
[ROARS]

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.054
CRIMSON DRAGON?

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:12.758
UH...
UH...
UH...

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:15.728
HUH?

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:24.971
HUH! LEO!

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:33.279
LEO. HE'S OK.
I'LL SAY.

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.081
CRIMSON DRAGON
SAVED HIM.

00:18:35.748 --> 00:18:37.550
LUNA!
LEO IS SAFE.

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.020
YUSEI.

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:43.489
[THINKING]
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:45.424
THANK GOODNESS FOR
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:47.994
HE'LL ALWAYS BE THERE
TO SAVE THE DAY.

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:50.463
Jakob: AT LAST,
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.501
FUNNY HOW WHAT SAVES THEM NOW
WILL DO THEM IN LATER.

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:02.942
YOUR BROTHER MAY
HAVE BEEN SPARED,

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.444
BUT YOU WON'T SHARE
IN HIS LUCK.

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:07.680
NOW IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME.

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.616
I PLAY A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:14.754
LEO GAVE HIS ALL FOR ME.
I WON'T LET IT BE FOR NOTHING.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:19.492
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND I SUMMON REGULUS.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:26.666
I THEN ACTIVATE THE TRAP
ANCIENT SUNSHINE,

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:29.268
BUT THE SUN WON'T BE SHINING
ON YOU BECAUSE NOW,

00:19:29.935 --> 00:19:30.970
SINCE REGULUS
IS OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:34.340
I SIMPLY REMOVE THE SLEEPING
ANCIENT FAIRY DRAGON FROM PLAY,

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.643
AND THEN YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO FAIRY DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.478
AND THAT'S 2,100.

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:42.281
GET HIM!

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.953
YES! IF THIS WORKS, LESTER'LL
ONLY HAVE 100 LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:51.957
HA HA! I'M ACTIVATING MY TRAP
INFINITY FORCE.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:54.393
NOW, LUNA, SINCE THERE'S
A MONSTER WITH "INFINITY"

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:57.329
IN ITS NAME ON MY SIDE
OF THE FIELD AND SINCE
YOU ACTIVATED

00:19:57.997 --> 00:20:01.133
A CARD THAT DEALS EFFECT DAMAGE,
ALL DAMAGE BECOMES ZERO,

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:05.471
AND ALL MONSTERS
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD
ARE DESTROYED.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.148
HA HA HA!

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:18.651
NOW YOU'RE WITHOUT MONSTERS
AND WITHOUT HOPE.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:20.119
[GASPS]

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:23.255
MY TURN. I DRAW.

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:28.594
MACHINE EMPEROR SKIEL,
ATTACK LUNA DIRECTLY.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.130
[GASPS]

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.503
UGH! LUNA!

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:45.177
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING
DOWN THERE.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.249
UHH...HUH?

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.618
CAN IT BE?
KURIBON!

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:57.022
YOU'RE HERE. YOU'RE
ALL HERE, BUT NO.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.191
YOU'LL BE HURT.

00:21:01.827 --> 00:21:04.830
[THINKING] I SENSE SOMETHING--
GREAT COURAGE, GREAT SACRIFICE.

00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:06.999
HUH?

00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:11.036
IT'S DUEL SPIRITS.

00:21:11.704 --> 00:21:13.005
Akiza: BUT WILL THEY
BE ENOUGH?

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.075
[ALL GRUNTING]

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.545
AAH!

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.250
NO!

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:42.001
[ALL GRUNTING]

00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:44.937
AAH!

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:50.810
LUNA!

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:52.945
Regulus: STEADY YOURSELF, LUNA.

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:55.748
YOUR LIFE POINTS MAY NOT HAVE
SURVIVED THAT BLAST,

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:56.849
BUT YOU DID...

00:21:57.516 --> 00:21:58.450
[ROARS]

00:21:59.118 --> 00:22:01.821
AND SO DID WE.

00:22:03.022 --> 00:22:03.556
HUH?

00:22:04.223 --> 00:22:05.257
Akiza: LUNA'S DUEL
SPIRITS MUST'VE BEEN

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.160
JUST STRONG ENOUGH TO
WITHSTAND THAT ASSAULT.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:14.266
RRGH!

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:25.144
THANK YOU, REGULUS.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:28.981
[ALL GRUNT]

00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:34.920
Crow: SORRY,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

00:22:35.588 --> 00:22:36.889
NO WAY.

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.124
I SAW IT WITH
MY OWN TWO EYES.

00:22:39.792 --> 00:22:41.360
IT WAS THIS GREAT,
BIG MANSION,

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.529
GINORMOUS,
RIGHT, LUNA?

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.931
Luna:
YEAH. LESTER SAID
IT WAS HIS HOME.

00:22:46.599 --> 00:22:48.667
Jack: YOU SURE? DOES HE HAVE
ANY OTHER FRIENDS WE COULD ASK?

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:52.238
UH, YEAH,
OF COURSE.

00:22:52.905 --> 00:22:54.073
LET'S GO ASK BOB
FROM CLASS.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.142
LESTER, HUH?

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.545
SORRY, GUYS.
DON'T KNOW HIM.

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:02.982
BUT, BOB, YOU WERE
SUPER CHUMMY WITH
HIM ALL LAST WEEK.

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:05.885
YOU EVEN ASKED HIM
TO AUTOGRAPH YOUR
FACE, REMEMBER?

00:23:06.552 --> 00:23:08.854
ALL LAST WEEK?
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.490
I WAS AT HOME SICK
ALL LAST WEEK.
HUH?

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:13.859
SEE YA.

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:18.564
HMM?
WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.232
I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.901
BUT MY GUT'S
TELLIN' ME THERE'S
SOME BIG-TIME

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.770
TROUBLE AFOOT,
DONTCHA THINK,
AKIZA?

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:27.006

UH-HUH.

00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:30.009
WELL, I SAY
BRING IT ON THEN.

00:23:30.676 --> 00:23:32.978
WHY LET TROUBLE FIND US
WHEN WE CAN GO AND FIND IT?

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:36.215
BECAUSE, JACK, TO DEFEAT
THIS SO-CALLED TROUBLE,

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:38.450
WE'LL NEED TO PERFECT
A NEW WAY OF DUELING.

00:23:39.118 --> 00:23:42.488
WE NEED TO MASTER THE WAY
OF ACCEL SYNCHROS...

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:47.059
[THINKING]
OR FACE CERTAIN DOOM.
