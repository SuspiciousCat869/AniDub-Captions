YOU HEARD THE MAN.
LET'S BOLT!

00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:37.485
THIS INTEL
WAS PERFECT.

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.320
CENTRAL, THE PRIZE
IS IN MY SIGHTS.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.656
LOCK ON
TO MY SIGNAL.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.334
MAN, I DIDN'T THINK
THEY'D BE ON ME THIS QUICK.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.172
YOU ON THE RUNNER,
PULL OVER.

00:09:58.172 --> 00:10:00.441
THERE'S NO USE
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:20.528
HUH. REMEMBER ME,
YUSEI?

00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:23.264
IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE THE CENTER.

00:10:23.264 --> 00:10:25.767
I'LL THANK JACK FOR
SETTING UP THIS REUNION.

00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:29.337
HA. HA HA HA! JACK SAID
WITH THE RIGHT BAIT,

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.039
RALLY WOULD LEAD US
RIGHT TO YOU.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:32.640
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE
LOCKED YOU UP

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.208
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:36.177
LOOKS LIKE I'LL
FINALLY GET MY WISH.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.513
AND WITH YOU AND RALLY
OFF TO THE FACILITY,

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:41.649
JACK WILL HAVE ONE LESS
THING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:44.385
NOW TELL ME, ARE YOU
GOING TO MAKE THIS EASY

00:10:44.385 --> 00:10:46.054
AND COME ALONG
QUIETLY?

00:10:46.054 --> 00:10:47.555
HMM.
I WILL...

00:10:47.555 --> 00:10:50.058
IF YOU CAN BEAT ME.

00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:52.527
HA HA HA. I SEE
YOU STILL THINK

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.195
YOU CAN OUTDUEL
SECTOR SECURITY.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.030
IT'S TOO BAD
THE RULES SAY

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.999
YOU SATELLITES
CAN'T CARRY CARDS.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:01.436
RULES WERE MADE
TO BE BROKEN.

00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:03.938
WEREN'T THEY?

00:11:03.938 --> 00:11:05.973
NOW, IF I WIN
THIS DUEL,

00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:07.475
RALLY AND ME
ARE FREE TO GO,

00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:08.943
NO QUESTIONS
ASKED, TRUDGE.

00:11:08.943 --> 00:11:11.379
THE LAW DOES NOT
NEGOTIATE WITH--

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.047
AND WHAT'S IN IT
FOR ME,

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:14.715
SHOULD I ACCEPT
YOUR PROPOSAL?

00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:16.384
BUT ARTICLE 4-B
CLEARLY STATES--

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.319
WELL, ALLOW ME
TO CLEARLY STATE THIS--

00:11:18.319 --> 00:11:19.887
GET MOVING, OR ELSE.

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.422
THIS IS HIGHLY
IMPROPER!

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:23.524
I SAID MOVE,
OR WOULD YOU PREFER

00:11:23.524 --> 00:11:26.427
TO BE WORKING
ON TRASH DETAIL?

00:11:26.427 --> 00:11:28.563
BACK TO COMMAND CENTRAL,
EVERYONE. DIRECT ORDERS.

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:34.368
WELL, SHOULD YOU
ACCEPT AND WIN,

00:11:34.368 --> 00:11:35.937
YOU'LL TELL
SECTOR SECURITY

00:11:35.937 --> 00:11:37.705
TO CALL OFF
THEIR HUNT
FOR RALLY.

00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:39.607
AND HOW DOES THAT
BENEFIT ME?

00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:41.542
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO SAY IT WAS ME
WHO STOLE THE CHIP

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:43.511
AND THAT I TRIED
TO FLEE THE SCENE

00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:45.213
BUT COULDN'T OUTRUN
YOUR PURSUIT.

00:11:45.213 --> 00:11:46.881
A STATEMENT LIKE
THAT WILL PROBABLY

00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:48.516
BUMP YOU UP
TO SERGEANT.

00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:50.251
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
OFFICER?

00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.155
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
A DEAL...FOOL.

00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:55.490
[ENGINES REVVING]

00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:02.096
HERE WE GO.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:05.800
I'LL ENGAGE
THE SPEED WORLD
FIELD SPELL.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.069
Computer:
DUEL MODE ENGAGED.

00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:10.805
AUTOPILOT ACTIVATED.

00:12:13.207 --> 00:12:15.042
LET'S RIDE!
LET'S RIDE!

00:12:35.227 --> 00:12:38.797
I CAN'T WAIT TO FINALLY
PUT YOU AWAY.

00:12:38.797 --> 00:12:42.834
AND MY ASSAULT DOG IS GOING TO
HELP MAKE SURE OF IT.

00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:45.203
WITH IT ON THE FIELD,
I PLACE A CARD FACE-DOWN

00:12:45.203 --> 00:12:47.506
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:48.907 --> 00:12:51.243
IT'S MY MOVE, THEN.

00:12:51.243 --> 00:12:53.445
AND WITH THE POWER
OF MY SPEED COUNTER,

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:56.915
I CAN SUMMON...
SPEED WARRIOR.

00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:01.586
YOU NEVER WERE GOOD AT MATH,
NOW, WERE YOU?

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:04.523
I MEAN, THAT MONSTER'S ATTACK
POINTS ARE LESS THAN MINE.

00:13:04.523 --> 00:13:06.024
WHY BOTHER
SUMMONING HIM OUT?

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:13.198
HEY, WHY DID HIS ATTACK
POINTS DOUBLE LIKE THAT?

00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:14.866
I HEARD YOU WERE
AT THE BOTTOM

00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:16.368
OF YOUR CLASS
AT THE ACADEMY.

00:13:16.368 --> 00:13:18.436
AND I CAN SEE
WHY NOW.

00:13:18.436 --> 00:13:20.539
HA. STILL
A WISE GUY, I SEE.

00:13:20.539 --> 00:13:22.474
I EXPECTED NOTHING LESS.

00:13:22.474 --> 00:13:25.110
WELL, DID YOU EXPECT
MY SPEED WARRIOR

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.912
TO TAKE OUT
YOUR BLAST DOG?

00:13:30.382 --> 00:13:33.251
GO, HYPERSONIC SLASH!

00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:39.958
YOU ALWAYS WERE
A KNOW-IT-ALL.

00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.828
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO TEACH YOU
A BRAND-NEW LESSON, YUSEI.

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:50.435
SEE, WHEN ASSAULT DOG
IS SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:53.271
BECAUSE OF AN ATTACK,
I CAN SUMMON ANOTHER ONE

00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:56.541
FROM MY DECK
TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:58.944
STILL USING THE SAME
OLD DECK, I SEE.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:02.614
I PLAY A FACE-DOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:02.614 --> 00:14:05.417
AND NOW THAT YOUR SPEED
WARRIOR'S ATTACK POINTS
ARE HALVED,

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:07.686
I REMOVE MY ASSAULT
DOG FROM PLAY

00:14:07.686 --> 00:14:09.988
TO BRING OUT
HANDCUFFS DRAGON.

00:14:09.988 --> 00:14:12.057
HERE'S A QUICK
MATH LESSON.

00:14:12.057 --> 00:14:14.459
WITH 1,800 ATTACK POINTS,
YOUR SPEED WARRIOR

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:17.896
IS ABOUT TO GET SUBTRACTED
FROM THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:14:17.896 --> 00:14:19.464
NOT IF I PLAY
MY FACE-DOWN.

00:14:19.464 --> 00:14:22.701
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:23.935
GRR...

00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:26.271
WITH THIS, I CAN ABSORB
YOUR DRAGON'S ATTACK

00:14:26.271 --> 00:14:28.573
AND SAVE
MY SPEED WARRIOR.

00:14:28.573 --> 00:14:31.309
HA. YOU MEAN THAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:33.778
IF NOT FOR THE WIRETAP
TRAP CARD!

00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:35.580
COME ON, YUSE.
FOCUS.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.017
YOU CAN'T LET THIS GUY
PUSH YOU AROUND.

00:14:39.017 --> 00:14:43.054
HANDCUFFS DRAGON,
TAKE OUT HIS MONSTER!

00:14:43.054 --> 00:14:44.089
HMM.

00:14:46.858 --> 00:14:48.960
YOUR DECK'S MADE UP
OF CARDS OTHERS THREW AWAY,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.896
AND NO MATTER
HOW YOU PATCH IT UP,

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:52.397
TRASH IS STILL TRASH.

00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:55.800
IT'S MY TURN.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.904
I SUMMON SONIC CHICK
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:01.773 --> 00:15:03.541
NEXT I PLACE 2 CARDS
FACE-DOWN

00:15:03.541 --> 00:15:05.176
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:07.545
HA HA HA! JUST LIKE
A SATELLITE

00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:09.915
TO HIDE BEHIND JUNK.
WELL...

00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:12.384
I'LL FLUSH YOU OUT. HA.

00:15:12.384 --> 00:15:14.920
1, 2, 3.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.924
HA HA HA! NOW BY SENDING
THOSE 3 CARDS TO MY GRAVEYARD,

00:15:18.924 --> 00:15:22.527
I CAN SPECIAL-SUMMON
MONTAGE DRAGON TO THE FIELD.

00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:32.604
AND WITH A POWERFUL BEAST
LIKE THAT IN PLAY,

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:35.173
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THIS DUEL IS OVER

00:15:35.173 --> 00:15:37.309
AND I GET TO TURN YOU IN.

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:39.277
Computer: MONTAGE DRAGON'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:41.780
ARE EQUAL TO THE TOTAL LEVEL
OF THE MONSTERS

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.083
SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD
MULTIPLIED BY 300.

00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:50.188
QUITE THE BEAST.

00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:51.790
WAIT TILL YOU
SEE IT IN ACTION.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.658
BUT FIRST,
MY HANDCUFFS DRAGON

00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:55.427
IS TAKING OUT
YOUR SONIC CHICK.

00:15:59.064 --> 00:16:01.299
AND WITH HIM
OUT OF THE PICTURE,

00:16:01.299 --> 00:16:04.035
I'M JUST ONE ATTACK FROM
PUTTING YOU AWAY FOR GOOD.

00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:06.338
GO, POWER COLLAGE!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.942
[GROANING]

00:16:14.612 --> 00:16:16.214
YOU MAY HAVE
KNOCKED ME DOWN,

00:16:16.214 --> 00:16:17.649
BUT IT WILL TAKE
MORE THAN THAT

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.050
TO KNOCK ME OUT.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.919
THERE'S NOT
A CARD IN YOUR DECK

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:23.121
THAT CAN
SAVE YOU NOW.

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.223
HE'S RIGHT,
BUT I'VE NEVER RELIED

00:16:25.223 --> 00:16:27.092
ON JUST ONE CARD BEFORE,

00:16:27.092 --> 00:16:29.427
AND I DON'T PLAN
ON STARTING NOW.

00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:50.579
LET'S SEE
WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

00:16:52.247 --> 00:16:54.249
IT'S GO TIME.

00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:57.819
I SUMMON OUT THE JUNK
SYNCHRON TUNER MONSTER.

00:17:02.357 --> 00:17:05.026
Computer: JUNK SYNCHRON
IS A LEVEL-3 TUNER MONSTER.

00:17:05.026 --> 00:17:07.395
TUNER MONSTERS COMBINE
WITH OTHER MONSTERS

00:17:07.395 --> 00:17:10.765
TO FORM MORE POWERFUL
SYNCHRO MONSTERS.

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:13.902
YOU HAVE A TUNER MONSTER?
THAT CAN'T BE.

00:17:13.902 --> 00:17:15.604
AND YET SOMEHOW IT IS.

00:17:15.604 --> 00:17:17.439
NEXT UP, I ACTIVATE

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.808
THE GRACEFUL REVIVAL
TRAP CARD.

00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:21.089
AND IT ALLOWS ME TO DO

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:22.924
WHAT US SATELLITES
DO BEST--

00:17:22.924 --> 00:17:26.227
RECYCLE MY SPEED WARRIOR
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:17:28.896 --> 00:17:30.198
GRR...

00:17:32.433 --> 00:17:36.504
NOW I TUNE MY JUNK SYNCHRON
WITH MY SPEED WARRIOR

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:39.807
TO SYNCHRO-SUMMON
JUNK WARRIOR!

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.455
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:04.832
CLEVER MOVE,
BUT YOUR MONSTER'S

00:18:04.832 --> 00:18:07.668
STILL NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP MY MONTAGE DRAGON.

00:18:07.668 --> 00:18:10.371
LOOKS LIKE AFTER ALL THAT,
YOU STILL UNDERESTIMATED

00:18:10.371 --> 00:18:12.173
THE POWER OF MY BEAST.

00:18:12.173 --> 00:18:15.576
AND YOU UNDERESTIMATED
THE POWER OF MY DECK.

00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:17.111
GO, VISION WIND!

00:18:17.111 --> 00:18:19.447
MY VISION WIND?
YOU WON THAT FROM ME

00:18:19.447 --> 00:18:21.783
ON YOUR LAST DAY
AT THE RE-EDUCATION CENTER.

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:24.018
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH IT?

00:18:24.018 --> 00:18:27.088
WIN THIS DUEL. AS I'M
SURE YOU REMEMBER,

00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:28.556
WITH IT, I CAN
SPECIAL-SUMMON

00:18:28.556 --> 00:18:30.291
ONE LEVEL-2
OR BELOW MONSTER

00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:32.493
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,

00:18:32.493 --> 00:18:35.963
AND I SUMMON
MY SPEED WARRIOR!

00:18:37.932 --> 00:18:40.001
WITH IT ON THE FIELD,

00:18:40.001 --> 00:18:42.503
JUNK WARRIOR'S SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES,

00:18:42.503 --> 00:18:47.775
MAKING JUNK WARRIOR
900 POINTS STRONGER.

00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:50.812
HOW COULD I LET A PUNK KID
FROM THE SATELLITE SECTOR

00:18:50.812 --> 00:18:53.848
GET THE UPPER HAND,
WITH THAT POWER?

00:18:55.316 --> 00:18:57.585
MY JUNK WARRIOR
IS GOING TO MAKE SURE

00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:00.288
ME AND RALLY STAY FREE.

00:19:07.495 --> 00:19:09.430
I BET YOU THOUGHT
THAT BY ATTACKING,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.932
YOU'D ONLY BE
HURTING ME,

00:19:10.932 --> 00:19:13.167
WHEN IN FACT YOU REALLY
JUST HURT YOURSELF.

00:19:13.167 --> 00:19:15.770
BUT THAT'S NOTHING NEW,
IS IT, YUSEI?

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.106
AS I RECALL, YOU WERE
ALWAYS ONE TO ACT FIRST

00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:20.942
AND THINK SECOND.
REMINDS ME OF THE TIME

00:19:20.942 --> 00:19:22.777
YOU TRIED TO BREAK
CURFEW WITH RALLY.

00:19:22.777 --> 00:19:24.445
YOU NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D BE CAUGHT,

00:19:24.445 --> 00:19:26.280
BUT ONE NEVER DOES
UNTIL THEY ARE.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.517
I CAN STILL REMEMBER
THE SCARED LOOK ON RALLY'S FACE.

00:19:29.517 --> 00:19:31.486
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE IT AGAIN

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:34.322
ONCE YOUR FRIEND
IS ROUNDED UP.

00:19:34.322 --> 00:19:37.091
WELL, KEEP WAITING,
BECAUSE I'M NOT LOSING.

00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:38.559
NOT WHAT?

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:42.029
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
CARD EQUIP SHOT!

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:45.166
THIS RELEASES MY WARRIOR
FROM YOUR DRAGON'S GRIP

00:19:45.166 --> 00:19:47.935
AND LETS ME USE
ITS ABILITY AGAINST YOU.

00:19:47.935 --> 00:19:51.906
YOU CAN'T USE
MY MONSTER AGAINST ME!

00:19:51.906 --> 00:19:53.508
GROWING UP
ON THE STREETS,

00:19:53.508 --> 00:19:55.176
I LEARNED TO BECOME
VERY RESOURCEFUL,
