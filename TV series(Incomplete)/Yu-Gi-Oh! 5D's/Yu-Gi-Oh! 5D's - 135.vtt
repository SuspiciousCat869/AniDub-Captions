00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.633
WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN US

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:08.334
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.308
Aporia:
OF COURSE I ACCEPTED
THEIR INVITATION

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:17.844
AND ONCE I ARRIVED
AT THEIR SECRET COMPOUND

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.445
THAT WOULD BECOME MY NEW HOME,

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:21.714
I WAS SO HAPPY I DID.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:24.884
FOR YOU SEE, THE ONES
WHO TOOK ME IN WERE DEVOTED

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.387
TO RESTORING THE WORLD
TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.989
THE SECOND ZERO REVERSE
TRAGEDY STRUCK.

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:33.760
AND THEY WERE USING
VERY ADVANCED EQUIPMENT
IN THIS EFFORT.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.995
DAY AND NIGHT,
THE FOUR OF US LABORED

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.997
WITH BOTH OUR MINDS
AND OUR BODIES,

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:41.367
FOR A WAY TO TAKE BACK
ALL THE UNPLEASANTNESS.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.270
BUT SADLY IT WAS TO NO AVAIL.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.573
AND EVEN MORE SADLY,
ALL THE HARD WORK

00:11:46.573 --> 00:11:48.174
BEGAN TO TAKE ITS TOLL.

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.210
EXHAUSTED BY
THE LONG DAYS AND NIGHTS,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.845
THE MEMBERS OF OUR CONSORTIUM
BEGAN TO FALL ILL.

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:54.814
THINGS WERE SEEMING HOPELESS.

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:58.751
WHY, SOON, EVEN I WAS ON
THE VERGE OF THE GREAT ABYSS.

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:07.360
APORIA.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.562
Aporia [IN JAKOB'S VOICE]:
I GROW WEAK.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.197
[COUGHING]

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:14.367
BUT I CANNOT CONTINUE
THE MISSION ALONE.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.802
YES, I KNOW,

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:18.771
SO I WANT YOU
TO ADD TO YOUR RANKS

00:12:18.771 --> 00:12:21.774
BY CREATING FROM ME
THREE OTHERS.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:23.610
ZONE:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.211
YOU SEE,

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.147
THERE HAVE BEEN
THREE INSTANCES IN MY LIFE

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:30.416
THAT SHAPED WHO I AM.

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.786
THE DAY I WAS SEPARATED
FROM MY PARENTS.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:38.024
THE DAY THAT
MY PARTNER IN ARMS,

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:40.927
AND THE WOMAN THAT I LOVED,

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.096
WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:49.035
AND THE DAY THAT I LOST
THE WORLD THAT I ONCE KNEW

00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:52.171
AND CHERISHED SO MUCH.

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:55.475
SINCE I ARRIVED,
I'VE DONE MUCH RESEARCH.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.909
THE HARDWARE EXISTS

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.579
FOR YOU TO TAKE THESE
INSTANCES I'VE SHARED

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.448
AND GIVE THEM CORPOREAL LIFE.

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.917
TO MAKE THEM FLESH.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.486
DO THIS, FRIEND,

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:08.221
FOR ME,

00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.890
FOR ALL OF MANKIND.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.659
I SHALL.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.496
AND THROUGH THESE THREE
NEW AGENTS, YOU SHALL LIVE ON.

[ALL GASP]

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.202
SO YOU SEE, YUSEI,

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.872
ALL THIS TIME LESTER,
PRIMO, AND JAKOB

00:13:25.872 --> 00:13:27.707
WERE JUST DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF ME

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:29.909
FROM DIFFERENT
INSTANCES IN MY LIFE.

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:33.279
AND THEIR SOLE PURPOSE HERE
WAS TO GATHER ALL OF US,

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:37.116
TO WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES NOW.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:40.820
TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN WIPE
NEW DOMINO CITY OFF THE MAP.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.057
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVE HERE.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:46.893
BUT FEAR NOT, YUSEI.
THE PEOPLE OF NEW DOMINO

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:48.995
WON'T SUFFER THE SAME FATE
AS THEIR CITY.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.263
THEY WILL LIVE.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:52.665
BUT ONCE THEY GET TO KNOW
THE FESTERING DIMENSION

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:55.935
THAT THEY'VE BEEN BANISHED TO,
THEY MAY WISH THAT THEY HADN'T.

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.403
FESTERING WHAT?

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.105
Aporia:
IT'S OVER, YUSEI.

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:02.442
ONCE I WIN THIS DUEL,
THE CITY WILL BE DESTROYED...
Both: HUH?!

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:04.644
...AND MY FUTURE, REBORN.

00:14:04.644 --> 00:14:06.112
YOU'RE A FOOL!

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.715
NO, YUSEI, I'M AFRAID
YOU ARE THE FOOL.

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:11.484
I HAVE SEEN WHAT IS
IN STORE FOR ALL OF US.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:14.487
AND I WILL NOT STAND BY
AND FORSAKE THE FUTURE.

00:14:14.487 --> 00:14:18.825
SO READY YOURSELF, YUSEI,
BECAUSE IT ALL ENDS NOW.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:21.928
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING,

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:26.099

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.703

TURN OF EVENTS.

00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.538
THE DUELISTS ARE OFF
THE TRACK NOW.

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:08.775
BUT CONTINUING THEIR MATCH ON
CITY STREETS PACKED WITH PEOPLE!

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:11.511
KEEP FIGHTING THE FIGHT, YUSEI.
BEAT THIS GUY, PLEASE.

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.414
YUSEI REALLY HAS HIS WORK
CUT OUT FOR HIM NOW.

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:17.617
HUH?

00:15:20.153 --> 00:15:21.921
[EXPLOSIONS]

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.558
IF WHAT MY FATHER SAID TO ME
IN THAT DREAM IS TRUE,

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.727
I'D BETTER ACT FAST.

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:31.397
HA, YOU ARE WISE
TO FLEE, YUSEI.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:35.067
AFTER ALL, NOW THAT MY MEKLORD
HAS ABSORBED YOUR BEST MONSTER,

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:37.370
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHANCE TO BEAT ME.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.071
HAH.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.640
YOU ARE DONE FOR.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.378
USUALLY THIS IS WHEN I TELL
THE BAD GUY HOW WRONG HE IS,

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:47.680
BUT THIS TIME,
HE COULD BE RIGHT.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.150
MEKLORD ASTRO MEKANIKLE NOW
ATTACKS YOU DIRECTLY.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.386
GO, MEKANIKLE MAYHEM.

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:58.524

00:15:58.524 --> 00:16:00.293

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:03.262
UH-OH.
I PLAY SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW.

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.599
THIS NEGATES ONE OF APORIA'S
MONSTER'S ATTACKS.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:08.634
[EXPLOSION]

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.303
NOW GO!

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.009
I CAN'T DUEL WITH
ALL OF MY HEART

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:19.979
WITH THESE PEOPLE AROUND
AND IN HARM'S WAY.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.183
COME AND GET ME.

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.426
MC:
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.695
I'M JUST GUESSING,
BUT I BELIEVE YUSEI

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:38.764
IS LEADING APORIA
INTO SATELLITE.

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:46.038
THERE, IT'S JUST US NOW.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:49.809
OH, YUSEI,
A DO-GOODER TILL THE END.

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:53.279
AND ON THAT TOPIC,
I END MY TURN WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.348
SO SINCE IT'S NOW
THE END PHASE,

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:57.550
MY MEKANIKLE'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.219
AN ABILITY THAT SENDS
YOUR SHOOTING STAR DRAGON,

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:04.257
TO THE GRAVEYARD AND THEN USES
THOSE ATTACK POINTS AGAINST YOU.

[ALL GASP]

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.360
NO.
SHOOTING STAR DRAGON'S

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.263
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS
ARE 3,300 AND YUSEI...

00:17:10.263 --> 00:17:12.932
ONLY HAS 2,800
LIFE POINTS REMAINING.

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:14.534
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.369
BUT LOOK,
I THINK YUSEI SAW IT COMING.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.338
I ACTIVATE A TRAP
THAT'LL BLOW YOU AWAY.

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:22.808
NOW, APORIA,
BY DESTROYING ONE FACEUP CARD

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:25.077
IN MY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD ZONE,

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:28.247
I CAN DESTROY

[GLASS SHATTERS]

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:37.823
SO HE'S THROUGH?

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:39.926
THAT WAS THE ONLY MOVE
FOR YUSEI.

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:43.195
MAYBE SO, BUT THAT
WAS HIS BEST MONSTER.

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.197
RIGHT, WHICH MEANS YUSEI
WOULDN'T GIVE HIM UP

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:47.900
UNLESS HE REALLY KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.002
YOUR TURN NOW.

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:56.309
I DRAW.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:59.912
I PLAY THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.181
NOW, BY REMOVING
7 SPEED COUNTERS,

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.016
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW ONE CARD.

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.719
NEXT I'LL SUMMON THAT CARD
STRAIGHT TO THE FIELD

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:09.255
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.724
RISE, SALVAGENT.

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:13.426
NOW, BY RELEASING SALVAGENT,

00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:16.896
I CAN NEGATE THE ABILITY OF ONE
SYNCHRO MONSTER IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.831
AND SUMMON IT
TO THE FIELD IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:26.072
SHOOTING STAR DRAGON,
WELCOME BACK.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:29.575
HOWEVER, THE MONSTER SUMMONED
USING SALVAGENT'S EFFECT,

00:18:29.575 --> 00:18:31.544
DOESN'T COUNT AS
A SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:34.246
I'LL NOW THROW TWO FACEDOWNS
TO END MY TURN.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:36.482
HAH. YOU PATHETIC FOOL.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:40.453
WHAT GOOD IS IT WITHOUT
ITS STATUS OR SPECIAL ABILITY?

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:42.822
FOR ONE, NOW IT
CAN'T BE ABSORBED.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:46.592
WAIT, SO SHOOTING STAR DRAGON'S
JUST AN ORDINARY MONSTER NOW?

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:49.528
YEAH, AND THAT
CHANGES EVERYTHING.

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:08.547
THE MOMENT I WIN THIS DUEL,

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.750
NEW DOMINO CITY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.284
AND THEN,

00:19:12.284 --> 00:19:15.254
FROM ITS ASHES WILL RISE
A GRAND FUTURE.

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:18.491
DESTRUCTION NEVER LEADS
TO ANYTHING GRAND, APORIA.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:21.093
YOU HAVE YOUR OPINION, YUSEI,
AND I HAVE MINE.

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:24.430
SO LET'S JUST SETTLE THIS WITH
OUR CARDS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.431
AARGH.

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:28.868
MY TURN, I DRAW.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:31.771
AND NOW I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.740
NOW, BY REMOVING 7
OF MY SPEED COUNTERS,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.877
I GET TO DRAW ONE CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.049
I BANISH WISEL ATTACK 5
FROM MY HAND TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:46.185
SO THAT MEKLORD MEKANIKLE
GAINS WISEL'S ABILITY.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:49.221
NOW, WHEN MEKLORD
ASTRO MEKANIKLE ATTACKS

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.723
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:53.159
NOT ONLY DOES YOUR MONSTER
FEEL ITS WRATH,

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:56.128
BUT SO WILL
YOUR PRECIOUS LIFE POINTS.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:58.597
NOT WITH
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW OUT.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:19:59.999
THINK AGAIN.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.902
USING WISEL ATTACK 5'S SPECIAL
ABILITY, WHICH IS IN PLAY,

00:20:02.902 --> 00:20:06.539
I CAN NEGATE THE TRAP CARD
YOU ACTIVATED AND DESTROY IT.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.540
WHAT?

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.908
OH, NO.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:11.977
IF SCARECROW'S GONE, YUSEI
CAN'T STOP APORIA'S ATTACK.

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.612
AND THAT'S BAD.

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:16.415
SHOOTING STAR DRAGON
HAS 2,500 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:19.085
MEKLORD MEKANIKLE HAS 4,000.

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:20.753
THAT DIFFERENCE DOUBLED MEANS

00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:24.156
THAT YUSEI WILL HAVE 3,000
POUNDING POINTS OF DAMAGE
HEADED HIS WAY.

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:28.461
AND HE ONLY HAS
2,800 POINTS LEFT.

00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:31.430
JACK, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE MOVING!

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.367
I'D MOVE THE WHOLE WORLD
IF I COULD HELP YUSEI NOW.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:38.237
AARGH. YEAH, JACK,
I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YA.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:41.273
WE GOTTA SEND YUSEI
ALL OF OUR GOOD VIBES.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.512
[ENGINES ROAR]

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:54.086
THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS FOR YOU
AND NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.022
[CACKLING]

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.491
AARGH.
