WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.318
NOW LETS GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH! 5D's."

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:05.354
JUST DON'T
FORGET, GREIGER...

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:08.190
WE NEED YOU TO BRING
OUT YUSEI'S MARK.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.925
GREIGER KNOWS WHAT
THE STAKES ARE.

00:00:09.925 --> 00:00:11.860
AND WILL DETERMINE
IF YUSEI'S TRULY

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.395
A SIGNER ONCE
AND FOR ALL.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:14.363
CORRECT?

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:16.798
YES, I SWEAR IT, SIR.

00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:19.434
AND ONCE I'M FINISHED
CAN I RELY ON YOUR WORD?

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:20.636
OF COURSE!

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:21.837
YOUR VILLAGE RIGHT?

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:22.938
I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING THAT

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:25.040
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO
STOP THE DEVASTATION.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.708
HOW IS YOUR FAMILY?

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.710
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING FROM THEM?

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:30.178
NOTHING YET.

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:32.147
I HOPE THAT THEY
ARE ALL OKAY.

00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:34.950
OH, I'M SURE
THAT THEY ARE!

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.085
HMM.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.955
YOU CAN'T TRUST
GOODWIN'S WORD,
GREIGER.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.324
DON'T YOU SEE
YOU'RE BEING USED!

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:44.593
IF IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO REBUILD MY VILLAGE,

00:00:44.593 --> 00:00:47.362
THEN I'LL LET HIM USE
ME ALL HE WANTS, YUSEI.

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:48.830
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY...

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.899
AND IN A PERFECT WORLD
WE'D BOTH GET WHAT

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.901
WE WANT IN THE ARENA
TOMORROW.

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.970
BUT... THE WORLD
ISN'T PERFECT.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.072
ONE OF US HAS
TO LOSE.

00:00:57.072 --> 00:01:00.442
AND TOMORROW IT'S
GOING TO BE YOU!

00:01:00.442 --> 00:01:02.511
MC: WELCOME BACK
TO THE SEMI-FINALS

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.079
OF THE FORTUNE CUP!

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.615
FOUR DUELISTS REMAIN,
AND THE WINNER WILL TAKE

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:09.851
ON JACK ATLAS IN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP DUUUUUUUEL!

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:12.754
FIRST UP IN OUR TURBO DUEL,
WE'VE GOT YUSEI FUDO

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:17.592
SQUARING OFF AGAINST
THE TOWER OF POWER: GREIGER!

00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:21.663
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LET'S HEAR IT FOR YUSEI!

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:25.867
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT!

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.337
IT'S THE MOST INCREDIBLE DUEL
RUNNER I'VE EVER SEEN!

00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:30.272
IT'S A WHOPPER
OF A CHOPPER!

00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:31.707
IT'S THE WHEELS
WITH APPEAL!

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.942
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN:
IT'S GREIGER

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:36.611
AND HIS BEEEEEEEAST!

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.046
Tanner: THAT'S SOME
DUEL RUNNER?!

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:40.315
YUSEI'S GONNA HAVE HIS
WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:43.585
I SUMMON: FLYING
FORTRESS SKY FIRE!

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:47.689
I HATE TO DO THIS
TO YOU, YUSEI,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.157
BUT LIKE I TOLD
YOU LAST NIGHT,

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:51.993
ONE OF US HAS TO LOSE,
AND TODAY IT'S YOU!!

00:01:51.993 --> 00:01:54.663
JUST FACE IT FRIEND:
YOU CAN'T MAKE A MOVE

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:56.264
WITHOUT GETTING HURT!

00:01:56.264 --> 00:01:58.300
MY FAMILY NEEDS ME,
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.070
GONNA HAVE TO LOSE
THIS MATCH, YUSEI!

MC: WE'RE GOING INTO ROUND THREE
OF THIS NERVE-WRACKING DUEL,

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:09.838
AND GRIEGER'S NOW
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT!

00:03:11.173 --> 00:03:12.874
IT'S MY TURN.

00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:14.476
FLYING FORTRESS
SKY FIRE,

00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:16.678
TAKE OUT YUSEI'S
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:22.451
OHH.

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.020
UNH!

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.222
MC: YUSEI HAS TAKEN A LASHING!

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:29.691
HE'S SPINNING OUT,
HE'S GONNA... WAIT, NO!

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:32.260
HE'S MANAGED
TO GAIN CONTROL.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.995
BUT THAT DIRECT ATTACK
HAS FORCED YUSEI

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:36.531
TO SHIFT GEARS
AND HIS GAME PLAN

00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:38.767
AS IT LOOKS LIKE
THE 2100 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:42.604
HE TOOK COST HIM ALL THE SPEED
COUNTERS HE GAINED SO FAR.

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:45.707
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:47.375
IT'LL BE HARD
TO CATCH UP.

00:03:51.513 --> 00:03:54.549
HUH. YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE
ENOUGH GUY, YUSEI.

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.318
BUT YOU GOTTA FALL...

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:58.286
CAUSE I'VE GOT TOO MUCH
RIDING ON THIS DUEL

00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.088
TO RISK LOSING IT.

00:04:02.557 --> 00:04:05.560
AND SO DO I!

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.395
[THINKING]
WITH SKY FIRE
ON THE FIELD,

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:10.699
HE CAN DESTROY
THE FIRST CARD I
PLAY EVERY TURN, SO...

00:04:10.732 --> 00:04:14.169
FROM MY HAND,
I SUMMON SHIELD WARRIOR
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.037
[GRUNTING]

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:22.944
TOO BAD YOUR WARRIOR
CAN'T SHIELD ITSELF
FROM MY ASSAULT!

00:04:22.944 --> 00:04:25.113
REMEMBER...
WHEN YOU PLAY A CARD...

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:27.849
THAT CARD IS DESTROYED,
AND SKY FIRE RAINS

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.185
800 POINTS OF DAMAGE
FROM ABOVE.

00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:39.261
MC: YUSEI SPINS OUT AGAIN!

00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:41.129
Greiger: I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.697
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:45.133
GREIGER IS SERIOUSLY
WIPING THE TRACK WITH YUSEI!

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:47.068
THE KID'S GOT
NO SPEED COUNTERS...

00:04:47.068 --> 00:04:48.703
NO MONSTERS ON HIS FIELD...

00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:50.472
IF GREIGER NAILS HIM
WITH A DIRECT ATTACK

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:51.606
ON THIS NEXT TURN,

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:54.242
YUSEI'S FORTUNE CUP
WILL BE OVER.

00:04:54.242 --> 00:04:55.577
HE'S DONE!

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.145
GREIGER'S GOT HIM TO
WHERE HE CAN'T EVEN

00:04:57.145 --> 00:04:58.713
SUMMON A MONSTER
WITHOUT THE THING GETTING

00:04:58.747 --> 00:05:00.315
OBLITERATED
RIGHT AWAY!

00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:02.217
MAN, GREIGER
WON'T QUIT.

00:05:02.217 --> 00:05:04.619
HE'S JUST A HULKING
TOWER OF RUTHLESSNESS.

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.289
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT WHEN YOU WERE
DUELING HIM?

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.524
LEO WAS JUST TOO
EXCITED TO BE DUELING

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:12.260
IN THE TOURNAMENT
TO NOTICE THINGS
LIKE HIS OPPONENT.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.428
Tanner: I WOULDN'T
PUT THIS DUEL

00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:14.829
IN THE BOOKS JUST YET.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:16.197
YUSEI CAN WIN THIS.

00:05:16.197 --> 00:05:17.532
HE CAN?

00:05:17.532 --> 00:05:19.868
YOU BETCHA. NOW WHAT
DO WE KNOW ABOUT

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:23.838
THIS FLYING FORTRESS
SKY FIRE OF GREIGER'S?

00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:26.007
WELL, WE KNOW
IT'S BIG,
WE KNOW IT'S LOUD,

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:27.108
WE KNOW
IT'S POWERFUL,

00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:28.376
AND WE KNOW
THAT ONCE A TURN,

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:29.844
IT DESTROYS
A CARD YUSEI PLAYS

00:05:29.844 --> 00:05:31.479
THE SECOND
HE PLAYS IT.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.781
AND AS SOON AS
GREIGER DESTROYED

00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:35.951
SHIELD WARRIOR, YUSEI
PLACED A CARD FACEDOWN.

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:37.085
I GET IT!

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:38.253
YOU'RE THINKING
THE SUMMONING

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:40.422
OF SHIELD WARRIOR
WAS A DIVERSION!

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:41.890
MM-HMM.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.326
HIS REAL GOAL WAS
THAT FACEDOWN.

00:05:44.326 --> 00:05:45.961
I'LL BET YOU A CORN DOG,
THAT CARD'S

00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:48.229
A GAME CHANGER,
LIKE MIRROR FORCE.

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.432
[THINKING]
YUSEI HAS TWO
FACEDOWN CARDS...

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:51.833
LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE
CLEVER ENOUGH

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:54.469
TO FIGURE OUT
HIS GAME, GREIGER...

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.706
IT'S MY TURN!

00:05:57.706 --> 00:05:59.407
[THINKING]
AND I'M SURE ONE
OF HIS FACEDOWNS

00:05:59.407 --> 00:06:01.042
COULD TURN THE TABLES...

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:02.877
SO I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TURN 'EM FIRST!

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.921
YUSEI, YOU'RE
A VERY SKILLFUL DUELIST,

00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.623
BUT SO AM I.

00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:19.998
YOU MIGHT THINK YOUR
FACEDOWNS ARE SAFE,

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:21.966
BUT YOU BETTER
THINK AGAIN,

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:24.536
BECAUSE I'VE GOT YOUR
STRATEGY ALL FIGURED OUT...

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.871
I KNOW YOU'RE FIGHTING
TO HELP YOUR FRIENDS,

00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.774
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU
STOP ME FROM COMPLETING
MY MISSION,

00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:30.942
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M WILLING

00:06:30.942 --> 00:06:33.244
TO TAKE THE NECESSARY RISKS
TO DESTROY ANY CHANCES

00:06:33.244 --> 00:06:35.080
YOU HAVE OF WINNING
THIS DUEL.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.948
BUT I KNOW THIS WON'T
BE AN EASY TASK

00:06:36.948 --> 00:06:38.850
TO ACCOMPLISH, SO DON'T
EXPECT ME TO PULL

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.287
ANY PUNCHES, CAUSE I PLAN
ON USING EVERY CARD I HAVE

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:47.158
IN MY DECK TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M THE ONE TAKING
THE VICTORY LAP.

00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:48.693
HERE I COME!

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.099
BEHIND YOU, YUSEI!

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:55.900
GET READY FOR
A DIRECT ASSAULT!

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.902
THAT'S WHAT I
WAS HOPING FOR.

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:00.105
BUT WHY?

00:07:00.105 --> 00:07:03.074
SO I CAN PLAY
WASTELAND TORNADO.

00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:06.744
NOW I CAN USE THIS CARD TO
LAY WASTE TO ONE TRAP CARD.

00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:08.713
AND THE CARD I'M
DESTROYING IS...

00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:11.049
LIMITER BREAK!

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:13.284
WHY ARE YOU DESTROYING
YOUR OWN CARD?

00:07:13.284 --> 00:07:15.120
'CAUSE THIS CARD'S
DESTRUCTION GIVES ME

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.155
THE POWER TO SUMMON
SPEED WARRIOR

00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:18.423
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:07:18.423 --> 00:07:20.291
AND WITH A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:22.193
I WON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE.

00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:27.265
YOU MAY HAVE JUST
DODGED MY ASSAULT.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:29.134
BUT I STILL MANAGED
TO RID YOU OF ONE

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:31.069
OF YOUR
FACEDOWN CARDS.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:32.670
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
TO GET RID OF ANY

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.906
OF MY OWN CARDS
TO DO IT!

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.075
[THINKING]
THIS GUY'S NOT
MESSIN' AROUND.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:38.977
HE FIGURED OUT
MY GAME PLAN.

00:07:40.612 --> 00:07:43.047
TANNER... HE DIDN'T
PLAY MIRROR FORCE.

00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:44.682
WHERE'S DEX'S CORNDOG?

00:07:44.682 --> 00:07:46.718
WELL, WE NEVER SHOOK.

00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:49.787
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN

00:07:49.787 --> 00:07:51.189
AND END MY TURN.

00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:55.960
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.530
GO, YUSEI!

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.900
RALLY...

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.269
FROM MY HAND,
I SUMMON MASSIVE WARRIOR

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:07.539
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:09.140
WITH ANOTHER MONSTER
SUMMONED,

00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:10.875
ANOTHER MONSTER
GETS LEVELED.

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.711
AND ANOTHER 800 POINTS
OF DIRECT DAMAGE

00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:16.915
ARE COMING YOUR WAY
DUE TO MY SKY FIRE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:29.861
[ROARS]

00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:31.896
HUH!

00:08:31.896 --> 00:08:37.569
MC: WOAH! GREIGER HAS
LAPPED YUSEI!

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:40.271
I'M PLAYING
THE SPEED SPELL
ZERO REVERSE...

00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:42.941
Computer: ZERO REVERSE ALLOWS
YOU TO RE-SUMMON A MONSTER

00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.743
THAT WAS DESTROYED
BY AN EFFECT THIS TURN.

00:08:45.743 --> 00:08:48.680
HOWEVER, THIS MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS BECOME ZERO.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.219
AND NOW I RESUMMON
MASSIVE WARRIOR.

00:08:54.219 --> 00:08:57.088
WHY WOULD HE SUMMON
A MONSTER THAT
CAN'T ATTACK?

00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:03.061
ALMOST FORGOT!

00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:05.263
HERE... FOR GOOD LUCK.

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:06.731
WHAT IS IT, RALLY?

00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:09.867
TURBO BOOSTER!

00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:12.270
WASN'T THIS YOUR
FATHER'S CARD?

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.072
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT.

00:09:14.072 --> 00:09:17.809
LIKE MY DAD ALWAYS SAYS,
"YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU
MIGHT NEED A BOOST."

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:20.678
REMEMBER, WE'VE
GOT SOMETHING
IN COMMON, GREIGER.

00:09:20.678 --> 00:09:23.481
WE'RE BOTH OUT
FOR OUR OWN.

00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:25.950
AND IF I PLAN
ON WINNING THIS BATTLE,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.487
I'LL NEED MY FRIENDS
TO GET ME TO
THE FINISH LINE

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:31.322
THIS IS FOR YOU, RALLY!

00:09:31.322 --> 00:09:33.358
AND THE REST OF MY PALS!

00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:36.327
I SUMMON TURBO BOOSTER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:43.134
NOW, MASSIVE WARRIOR,

00:09:43.134 --> 00:09:45.203
ATTACK GREIGER'S
SKY FIRE!

00:09:45.203 --> 00:09:47.872
YOU'RE JUST SENDING
YOUR MONSTER TO ITS DOOM.

00:09:47.872 --> 00:09:50.775
NOT WITH TURBO BOOSTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:53.011
YOU SEE BY RELEASING
THIS CARD,

00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:54.379
I CAN TAKE DOWN
A MONSTER OF YOURS

00:09:54.379 --> 00:09:58.283
AS LONG AS IT'S FIGHTING
AGAINST ONE OF MINE.

00:09:58.283 --> 00:10:01.452
BUT BECAUSE OF THE BATTLE,
I'M STILL ABLE
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:10:01.452 --> 00:10:02.720
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.422
MASSIVE WARRIOR CAN
MAKE MY BATTLE DAMAGE

00:10:04.422 --> 00:10:05.823
BECOME ZERO.

00:10:05.823 --> 00:10:07.759
HUH?

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.261
I RELEASE
TURBO BOOSTER!

00:10:16.034 --> 00:10:18.369
WOAH! TALK ABOUT A COMEBACK!

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:21.539
YUSEI HAS BLASTED GREIGER'S
SKY FIRE OUTTA THE SKY!

00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:22.540
HUH?!

00:10:27.912 --> 00:10:29.747
AAH!

00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:45.200
AAH!

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.368
INCREDIBLE!

00:10:46.401 --> 00:10:48.904
YUSEI HAS DESTROYED
GREIGER'S SKY FIRE,

00:10:48.904 --> 00:10:50.572
OH, THE HUMANITY!

00:10:50.572 --> 00:10:52.507
YOU MAY HAVE GROUNDED
MY AIR ASSAULT

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:53.708
BUT LET'S SEE
HOW YOU HANDLE

00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:58.113
MY CHARIOT PILE TRAP CARD!

00:10:58.113 --> 00:10:59.347
OH, NO!

00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:01.082
YOU WON'T DEFEAT ME,
YUSEI.

00:11:01.082 --> 00:11:03.051
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE HERE.

00:11:06.454 --> 00:11:08.056
DIRECTOR GOODWIN,
THE NEXT MATCH IS

00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:09.824
ABOUT TO BEGIN,
AND WE DIDN'T WANT

00:11:09.824 --> 00:11:10.926
TO START WITHOUT YOU.

00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:12.127
Greiger:
TURN THIS SIGNAL OFF!

00:11:12.127 --> 00:11:13.895
HEY WAIT A SECOND.

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:15.263
YOU'RE NOT THE DIRECTOR.

00:11:15.263 --> 00:11:16.364
WHO IS THIS?

00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:17.866
THAT OFFICE
IS OFF LIMITS.

00:11:17.866 --> 00:11:19.568
[THINKING]
AND SO WAS
MY VILLAGE.

00:11:19.568 --> 00:11:21.937
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT
YOUR HIDING, GOODWIN.

00:11:21.937 --> 00:11:24.906
I KNEW IT!
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE
IN YOUR PERSONAL FILES.

00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:27.542
YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DESTRUCTION
OF MY VILLAGE.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:30.478
AAH!

00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:34.282
I'LL GET YOU, GOODWIN...

00:11:34.282 --> 00:11:36.785
I RESPECT YOU AS
A DUELIST, YUSEI,

00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:38.787
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING
I MUST DO.

00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:42.223
AND YOU'RE JUST
A ROADBLOCK STANDING
IN MY WAY.

00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:44.726
CHARIOT PILE'S
EFFECT ACTIVATES!

00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:47.228
SO ONCE A TURN
MY CHARIOT CAN HIT YOU

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:49.698
FOR 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:11:49.698 --> 00:11:51.266
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LIFE
POINTS ARE ABOUT TO GET

00:11:51.266 --> 00:11:53.201
SPEARED, YUSEI.

00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:56.271
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN
OUTRUN MY ATTACK...

00:11:56.271 --> 00:11:58.340
MAYBE, BUT I CAN
CERTAINLY OUTMANEUVER IT

00:11:58.373 --> 00:12:04.646
BY SACRIFICING
MY MASSIVE WARRIOR.

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:08.016
YOU CAN TRY TO DEFEND
YOURSELF ALL YOU WANT,

00:12:08.016 --> 00:12:10.151
BUT YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING
YOUR OWN DEFEAT.

00:12:13.989 --> 00:12:15.857
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:17.626
[THINKING]
AND IF I DON'T
PULL THIS COMBO OFF,

00:12:17.626 --> 00:12:19.227
I'M DONE FOR...

00:12:19.227 --> 00:12:21.730
I SUMMON TO THE FIELD
JUNK SYNCHRON!

00:12:22.864 --> 00:12:24.899
TCHA!

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:27.235
AND BECAUSE I
SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED IT OUT,

00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:32.207
I CAN ALSO SUMMON
A MONSTER OUT DIRECTLY
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:12:32.207 --> 00:12:34.476
HYAH!

00:12:34.476 --> 00:12:37.979
SO I RE-SUMMON
SPEED WARRIOR!

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:39.414
AND BECAUSE SPEED
WARRIOR'S HERE

00:12:39.414 --> 00:12:42.384
ON THE FIELD,
I CAN NOW GIVE HIM
A LITTLE TUNE UP.

00:12:46.955 --> 00:12:48.757
THAT WON'T
HELP YOU, YUSEI.

00:12:57.432 --> 00:12:59.100
JUNK WARRIOR...

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.836
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:13:01.836 --> 00:13:05.774
SEND HIS LIFE POINTS
TO THE JUNK PILE!

00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:07.342
GO SCRAP FIST!

00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:08.910
NOT GOOD ENOUGH, YUSEI!

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.147
I'M AFRAID THAT
CHARIOT PILE HAS ANOTHER EFFECT.

00:13:12.147 --> 00:13:14.349
WHEN YOUR MONSTER
ATTACKS ME DIRECTLY,

00:13:14.349 --> 00:13:16.451
I CAN SACRIFICE
800 LIFE POINTS

00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:18.720
TO DEFLECT YOUR
MONSTER'S ATTACK...

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.623
AND DESTROY
YOUR MONSTER!

00:13:21.623 --> 00:13:24.726
MAN, YUSEI JUST CAN'T
SEEM TO KEEP A MONSTER
ON THE FIELD.

00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:27.562
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:13:27.562 --> 00:13:29.397
IT'S MY MOVE.

00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:34.369
AND I SUMMON BLACK SALVO!

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.975
Computer: WHEN YOU SUMMON
THE TUNER MONSTER

00:13:40.975 --> 00:13:43.745
BLACK SALVO YOU CAN ALSO
SUMMON ONE LEVEL 4

00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:46.014
DARK ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD

00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:48.850
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.486
SO WITH THE POWER
OF MY BLACK SALVO,

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:54.289
I'M BRINGING BACK MY
TRAP REACTOR Y-FI!

00:13:57.358 --> 00:13:59.360
AND NOW I TUNE MY
BLACK SALVO

00:13:59.394 --> 00:14:02.297
WITH MY LEVEL 4
TRAP REACTOR Y-FI!

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:07.669
A SYNCHRO SUMMON?

00:14:07.669 --> 00:14:09.070
YOUR SURPRISED?

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.305
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
DUELIST WHO USES

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:13.608
SYNCHRO MONSTERS.

00:14:13.608 --> 00:14:18.179
I GIVE YOU
DARK STRIKE FIGHTER!

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:20.815
AND NOW IT'S GOING TO
ATTACK YOU DIRECTLY!

00:14:24.152 --> 00:14:27.989
NOT IF I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD...
SYNCHRO SPIRITS!

00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:29.624
BY REMOVING
A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:14:29.624 --> 00:14:31.126
IN MY GRAVEYARD
FROM PLAY,

00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:32.494
I CAN RE-SUMMON
THE MONSTERS

00:14:32.494 --> 00:14:34.896
THAT WERE ORIGINALLY
NEEDED TO SUMMON IT.

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:38.366
SO I'M TAKING
JUNK WARRIOR
OUTTA THE DUEL!

00:14:38.366 --> 00:14:41.002
NOW JUNK SYNCHRON
AND SPEED WARRIOR

00:14:41.002 --> 00:14:43.204
CAN RETURN
TO THE FIELD.

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:50.211
WHAT'S THIS?

00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:51.412
HOW DID HE SURVIVE
THAT ATTACK?

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:53.748
BY TAKING SHIELD WARRIOR
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:55.517
AND REMOVING IT
FROM PLAY,

00:14:55.517 --> 00:14:57.685
I CAN NEGATE
ALL BATTLE DAMAGE.

00:14:57.685 --> 00:15:00.588
THEN I THINK I'LL ACTIVATE
CHARIOT PILE'S EFFECT!

00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:02.924
THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU
TO NEGATE THIS DAMAGE

00:15:02.924 --> 00:15:04.859
IS TO SACRIFICE
YOUR OTHER MONSTER.

00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:07.495
WELL, THEN THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO!

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.635
YOU'VE GOT AN ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING I THROW

00:15:13.635 --> 00:15:15.537
YOUR WAY, DON'T YOU?

00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:16.871
WELL LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU DO ABOUT

00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:18.573
THE ULTIMATE
FLARE TRAP CARD,

00:15:18.573 --> 00:15:23.011
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO SUMMON
AN ULTIMATE FLARE TOKEN!

00:15:23.011 --> 00:15:24.779
ANYONE KNOW
WHAT THAT DOES?

00:15:24.779 --> 00:15:26.447
WELL LETS JUST SAY THAT
YUSEI'S ABOUT TO GET

00:15:26.447 --> 00:15:29.150
KNOCKED AROUND
FOR ANOTHER
800 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.019
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
GREIGER'S FIGHTER

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:33.588
CAN NOW DEAL DAMAGE
EQUAL TO 200 TIMES
THE LEVEL

00:15:33.588 --> 00:15:35.223
OF THE RELEASED
MONSTER AND...

00:15:35.223 --> 00:15:38.426
AND ULTIMATE FLARE TOKEN
IS A LEVEL 10.

00:15:38.426 --> 00:15:40.428
THAT MEANS, UUH...
WELL, UHH...

00:15:40.428 --> 00:15:42.063
TEN TIMES TWO-HUNDRED
COMES OUT TO

00:15:42.063 --> 00:15:44.132
TWO-THOUSAND POINTS
OF DAMAGE.

00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:45.834
TWO-THOUSAND?!

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:48.269
I'M AFRAID YOUR FATE
HAS BEEN SEALED, YUSEI!

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:51.573
THERE IS NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN DO TO WIN
THIS TURBO DUEL NOW.

00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:53.675
ON MY NEXT TURN
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:55.743
THINGS ARE LOOKING
HELPLESS FOR YUSEI.

00:15:55.743 --> 00:15:57.512
HE'S HOLDING
NO CARDS IN HIS HAND.

00:15:57.512 --> 00:15:59.013
ONE MONSTER
ON THE FIELD.

00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:01.449
EVERYTHING DEPENDS
ON HIS NEXT DRAW!

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:07.455
LET'S DO THIS!

00:16:07.455 --> 00:16:09.924
THIS SHOULD GET ME
WHERE I WANNA GO.

00:16:09.924 --> 00:16:12.794
I SUMMON
TUNING SUPPORTER
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:18.566
NEXT I TUNE
MY JUNK SYNCHRON

00:16:18.566 --> 00:16:20.134
TO MY
TUNING SUPPORTER.

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:28.343
I SYNCHRO SUMMON...
ARMORY ARM!

00:16:28.343 --> 00:16:30.345
YOU'RE GRASPING
AT STRAWS, YUSEI.

00:16:30.345 --> 00:16:33.081
THAT MONSTER CAN'T DEFEAT
MY DARK STRIKE FIGHTER!

00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:35.450
MAYBE NOT, BUT WHEN
TUNING SUPPORTER IS USED

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.652
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,
IT ENABLES ME TO DRAW

00:16:37.652 --> 00:16:39.654
ANOTHER CARD
STRAIGHT TO MY HAND.

00:16:39.654 --> 00:16:41.990
YUSEI HAS MANAGED TO
SQUEEZE SOME MORE LIFE

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.992
OUT OF HIS
FLOUNDERING DECK!

00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:45.360
GO, YUSEI!

00:16:45.393 --> 00:16:46.794
MAKE THIS WORK!
YOU CAN DO IT...

00:16:46.794 --> 00:16:48.696
IT ALL COMES
DOWN TO THIS.

00:16:48.696 --> 00:16:50.465
IF I DON'T DRAW
THE CARD I NEED,

00:16:50.465 --> 00:16:52.033
I'M FINISHED.

00:17:03.944 --> 00:17:05.312
[THINKING]
HERE I GO.

00:17:05.312 --> 00:17:07.664
NOW, IF I DON'T
DRAW THE CARD I NEED,

00:17:07.664 --> 00:17:10.934
GREIGER'S GONNA
RUN OVER THE REST
OF MY LIFE POINTS.

00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:21.845
WAS THAT A SMILE?
DID I SEE A SMILE?

00:17:21.845 --> 00:17:26.282
I ACTIVATE THE SYNCHRO
RETURN SPEED SPELL CARD.

00:17:26.282 --> 00:17:29.519
AND AS LONG AS I
HAVE FIVE OR MORE
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:31.054
I CAN USE THIS SPELL
TO SUMMON

00:17:31.054 --> 00:17:32.422
A SYNCHRO MONSTER
THAT I REMOVED

00:17:32.422 --> 00:17:34.024
FROM PLAY EARLIER
IN THE DUEL.

00:17:34.024 --> 00:17:37.227
SO SAY HELLO AGAIN
TO MY JUNK WARRIOR!

00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:39.529
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
ARMORY ARM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:40.764
WHAT?!

00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:42.298
NOW MY
JUNK WARRIOR GAINS

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:44.167
A THOUSAND MORE
ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:51.941 --> 00:17:53.910
AND WITH THAT BOOST
MY JUNK WARRIOR'S

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.680
MORE POWERFUL THAN YOUR
DARK STRIKE FIGHTER!

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.149
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NEXT!

00:17:59.149 --> 00:18:01.785
JUNK WARRIOR,
ATTACK!

00:18:01.785 --> 00:18:03.653
[ROARING]

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.170
AAH!

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.872
AND NEXT I ACTIVATE
ARMORY ARM'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:18:22.872 --> 00:18:25.308
AND THAT MEANS THAT
THIS DUEL IS OVER.

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:27.343
YOU SAID THAT ONE
OF US WAS GOING TO HAVE

00:18:27.343 --> 00:18:28.645
TO LOSE TODAY,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE

00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:30.513
THAT SOMEONE IS YOU!

00:18:30.513 --> 00:18:31.848
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.618
[GRUNTING]

00:18:35.618 --> 00:18:37.587
AAH!

00:18:40.323 --> 00:18:44.627
AAH! AAH!

00:18:44.627 --> 00:18:46.463
[GRUNTING]

00:18:51.735 --> 00:18:53.303
All: HE DID IT!
YEAH!

00:18:53.303 --> 00:18:55.138
I KNEW HE COULD
PULL IT OFF!

00:18:55.138 --> 00:18:57.173
THAT WAS
AN AMAZING WIN.

00:18:57.173 --> 00:18:59.309
HEY, UH... IF
THE DUEL'S OVER...

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:02.078
HOW COME THOSE
SPIKY THINGS HAVEN'T
VANISHED YET?

00:19:04.781 --> 00:19:06.883
Lazar: WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.

00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:08.685
YUSEI WILL WAKE UP
TO HIS ABILITIES

00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:12.889
AS A SIGNER SOON ENOUGH,
WE MUST BE PATIENT.

00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:15.158
[THINKING]
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU LOST, GREIGER.

00:19:15.158 --> 00:19:18.094
NOW ALL YUSEI HAS TO
DO IS WIN ONE MORE DUEL

00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:20.897
AND THEN HE AND I CAN
SETTLE THINGS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:19:20.897 --> 00:19:22.932
MC: THAT'S IT, PEOPLE!

00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:25.301
AFTER SIX ROUNDS
OF WHITE-KNUCKLE ACTION,

00:19:25.301 --> 00:19:27.036
THIS DUEL HAS ROARED
TO A CLOSE

00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:28.805
WITH A STUNNING FINALE.

00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:30.940
SATELLITE'S SHOOTING STAR
MANAGED TO WHIP OUT

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.709
A COME-FROM-BEHIND WIN!

00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:34.811
TAKE A VICTORY LAP, YUSEI!

00:19:34.811 --> 00:19:36.746
GREIGER,
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:19:36.746 --> 00:19:38.481
MC: COME ON, YUSEI,
GIVE US A...

00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.184
YUSEI...
I'M FINE.

00:19:41.184 --> 00:19:43.720
BUT IT'S NOT OVER.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.888
Lazar: WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:19:44.888 --> 00:19:46.990
TURN HIS MIC OFF.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:52.061
OLLY-OLLY-OXEN? HELLO.
IS THING EVEN ON?

00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:54.130
TESTING, ONE,
TWO, THREE...

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.698
Greiger: I WAS HOPING
TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY.

00:19:55.698 --> 00:19:59.002
BUT IF IT NEEDS TO BE
LIKE THIS, SO BE IT.

00:19:59.002 --> 00:20:00.236
WHAT'S HE
TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:20:00.236 --> 00:20:02.272
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
MY VILLAGE, YUSEI...

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:05.074
I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE FIRE
AND THE DESTRUCTION...

00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:06.776
BUT I'VE LEARNED
THE TRUTH...

00:20:06.776 --> 00:20:08.578
GOODWIN ISN'T GOING
TO HELP ME REBUILD

00:20:08.578 --> 00:20:11.080
MY VILLAGE LIKE
HE PROMISED.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.917
HOW COULD HE
WHEN IT ISN'T EVEN
THERE ANYMORE?

00:20:13.917 --> 00:20:16.219
WHADDYA MEAN?

00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:19.489
LOOK! THAT
WAS MY VILLAGE!

00:20:19.489 --> 00:20:21.658
BEFORE GOODWIN
CAME ALONG.

00:20:21.658 --> 00:20:24.627
HOW'S HE DOING THAT,
SOMEONE TURN OFF
THE SPHERE!

00:20:24.627 --> 00:20:26.830
LET HIM HAVE
HIS MOMENT...
HUH?

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.665
I HACKED
INTO GOODWIN'S
PERSONAL FILES

00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.300
BEFORE THE DUEL
AND DISCOVERED

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.402
IT WASN'T
A NATURAL DISASTER.

00:20:32.402 --> 00:20:34.537
GOODWIN CAME ALONG
AND DECIDED TO USE

00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:36.606
OUR VALLEY AS A LITTLE
TESTING GROUND...

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:39.142
HE TRIED TO RESURRECT
HIS PRECIOUS
CRIMSON DRAGON...

00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:41.177
BUT HE COULDN'T
CONTROL THE ENERGY,

00:20:41.177 --> 00:20:43.179
IT WAS TOO POWERFUL.
AND THEN...

00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:47.650
HE'S GOING TO EXPOSE
EVERYTHING,

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:48.918
WE MUST SILENCE HIM!

00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:51.788
UH... AREN'T
YOU CONCERNED?

00:20:51.788 --> 00:20:55.959
DON'T WORRY. NO ONE'S
GOING TO BELIEVE HIM.

00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:57.560
Greiger:
THE VILLAGE IS GONE!

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.897
EVERYONE WHO LIVED
THERE... ALL GONE.
VANISHED.

00:21:00.897 --> 00:21:02.932
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:05.501
GREIGER, ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.637
I SAW THE FILES
MYSELF.

00:21:07.637 --> 00:21:09.339
I'M CERTAIN
ABOUT IT, YUSEI.

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:13.409
AND NOW GOODWIN'S
GOING TO ANSWER
FOR ALL HIS LIES.

00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:14.410
HUH?

00:21:17.647 --> 00:21:19.449
GREIGER!

00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:21.084
NOW THAT THE WORLD
KNOWS WHAT YOU DID,

00:21:21.084 --> 00:21:23.720
IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO PAY!

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.588
TO MY FRIENDS...
MY FAMILY...

00:21:25.588 --> 00:21:27.323
MY HOME...

00:21:27.323 --> 00:21:29.459
[LAUGHING]

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:33.529
YOUR IVORY TOWER IS
ABOUT TO COME TUMBLING
DOWN, GOODWIN!

00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:37.600
[YELLING]

00:21:41.237 --> 00:21:42.238
NO!!

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:46.442
YUSEI!?

00:21:51.614 --> 00:21:53.983
AAH!

00:21:53.983 --> 00:21:55.852
[GROANING]

00:22:00.657 --> 00:22:02.458
HOW ARE YOU
DOING THAT!?

00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:09.632
YUSEI!

00:22:09.632 --> 00:22:10.800
HOW COULD YOU?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.168
I HAD HIM!

00:22:12.168 --> 00:22:14.404
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY
THAT GOODWIN LIED

00:22:14.404 --> 00:22:15.738
AND USED YOU.

00:22:15.738 --> 00:22:17.974
BUT LISTEN;
GOING AFTER HIM

00:22:17.974 --> 00:22:19.375
WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING

00:22:19.375 --> 00:22:21.511
OR GET YOU
YOUR ANSWERS.

00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:22.979
WHAT DO I DO?

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:25.481
YOU TRUST ME TO
FIGURE THINGS OUT.

00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:26.816
[GRUNTS]

00:22:26.816 --> 00:22:27.817
GOODWIN!!!!!!!!!!
