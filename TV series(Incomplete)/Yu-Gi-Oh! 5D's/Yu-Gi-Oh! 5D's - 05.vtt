00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:52.675
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
SEE IT AGAIN!

00:08:57.413 --> 00:08:58.447
UHH!

00:08:58.447 --> 00:09:00.183
Jack: MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN
GET ANOTHER CHANCE

00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:01.584
TO DESTROY
THE VERY BEAST

00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:03.252
YOU'RE TRYING
TO WIN BACK FROM ME.

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.288
YOU KNOW YUSEI,
WITH FRIENDS LIKE YOU,

00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:06.622
WHO NEEDS ENEMIES?

00:09:06.622 --> 00:09:08.824
AND WITH BOTH DRAGONS
BACK ON MY FIELD,

00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:10.193
IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
THIS BATTLE OF OURS

00:09:10.193 --> 00:09:12.628
HAS COME FULL CIRCLE
HASN'T IT?

00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:16.599
ACTUALLY...
NOT QUITE, JACK.

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:17.600
HM?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.469
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD!

00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:22.038
HARMONIA MIRROR!

00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:26.876
OH!

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:29.412
Yusei: CHECK THIS OUT...
BECAUSE YOU JUST SUMMONED

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:31.347
STARDUST DRAGON
TO YOUR FIELD

00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:34.450
USING A METHOD OTHER THAN
THE USUAL SYNCHRO SUMMON...

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.419
I CAN USE THE POWER
OF HARMONIA MIRROR

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:39.055
TO GET STARDUST FIGHTING
ON MY SIDE INSTEAD!

00:09:39.055 --> 00:09:41.157
WELCOME BACK OLD FRIEND!

00:09:44.227 --> 00:09:45.928
THAT'S NO BIGGIE.

00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:48.664
IT'S LIKE I SAID EARLIER
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:09:48.664 --> 00:09:50.499
I WAS MERELY USING IT
TO TRY AND MAKE

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:52.735
THIS DUEL
MORE INTERESTING.

00:09:52.735 --> 00:09:53.970
WELL YOU DID JACK,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.705
AND NOW I'M
GONNA REV THINGS UP

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:57.907
WITH MY STARDUST DRAGON!

00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:01.944
NOT BAD, YUSEI.

00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:03.446
MAYBE YOU HAVE LEARNED
A THING OR TWO

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:05.715
SINCE OUR DAYS TOGETHER
IN THE SATELLITE.

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:07.817
SO NOW WE'VE GOT
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND...

00:10:07.817 --> 00:10:09.685
VERSUS
STARDUST DRAGON...

00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:12.154
IN A FIGHT
TO THE FINISH!

00:10:30.203 --> 00:10:32.572
Jack: LOOKS LIKE
WE'LL FINALLY GET
THE CHANCE TO SEE

00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:35.008
WHOSE DRAGON
IS MIGHTIER YUSEI...

00:10:35.008 --> 00:10:37.077
AND YOU'LL FINALLY
GET THE CHANCE TO SEE

00:10:37.077 --> 00:10:38.778
THE DUELIST
THAT I'VE BECOME.

00:10:38.778 --> 00:10:39.846
REMEMBER THAT TALK
YOU GAVE

00:10:39.846 --> 00:10:41.881
AFTER YOU BEAT ME
IN OUR LAST DUEL...

00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:43.216
[GROWLS]

00:10:43.249 --> 00:10:45.185
DID HE...
JUST LOSE?!

00:10:45.185 --> 00:10:46.219
Jack: HE DID.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:48.755
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY
OUR FRIEND JUST LOST?

00:10:48.755 --> 00:10:51.458
BECAUSE HIS DECK
HAS NO BALANCE.

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:52.859
AND WITHOUT BALANCE.

00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:54.995
ONE CANNOT BE
A COMPLETE DUELIST.

00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:58.665
BUT YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY
DON'T YOU, YUSEI...

00:10:58.665 --> 00:10:59.933
WELL I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT,

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.935
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT
THAT DAY.

00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:03.036
THOSE WORDS HURT,

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:05.271
BUT THEY TAUGHT ME
A VALUABLE LESSON...

00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:08.308
OH REALLY YUSEI,
AND WHAT DID
THEY TEACH YOU...

00:11:08.308 --> 00:11:10.410
THAT IN ORDER TO BE
THE BEST I CAN BE...!

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.680
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN THE POWER OF
EVERY CARD IN MY DECK.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.881
AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY,

00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:16.516
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT DUEL WE HAD

00:11:16.516 --> 00:11:17.817
OVER AND OVER AGAIN;

00:11:17.817 --> 00:11:20.520
TRYING TO IMPLEMENT
NEW STRATEGIES
AND COMBINATIONS

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.422
THAT I WOULD HAVE NEVER
THOUGHT POSSIBLE.

00:11:22.422 --> 00:11:24.691
WELL YUSEI,
ACTIONS SPEAK
LOUDER THAN WORDS,

00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:26.860
SO LET'S JUST SEE
WHAT THAT
DECK OF YOURS

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.094
IS CAPABLE OF.

00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:29.462
YOU GOT IT JACK!

00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:31.431
AND WITH STARDUST DRAGON
ON MY FIELD

00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:32.966
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT!

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.206
THIS SATELLITE
DOESN'T KNOW WHEN
TO QUIT, DOES HE?

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.443
WELL PERHAPS... I SHOULD
SEND IN THE SECURITY TEAM

00:11:43.443 --> 00:11:45.311
TO END THIS
FOR HIM MR. GOOD- ...

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:47.914
HMMM...

00:11:49.816 --> 00:11:52.085
[GIGGLES, LAUGHS]

00:11:56.222 --> 00:11:57.390
LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT...

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.526
NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT
STARDUST ON YOUR SIDE...

00:11:59.526 --> 00:12:01.928
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU HAVE A CHANCE
AT BEATING ME?

00:12:01.928 --> 00:12:05.065
WELL, YOU DON'T.
I'M THE BEST.

00:12:05.065 --> 00:12:06.366
YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT ME,

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:07.834
NO MATTER HOW MANY
STARDUST DRAGONS

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:08.835
YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIELD,

00:12:08.835 --> 00:12:09.836
GOT THAT!

00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:11.538
NOW BRING IT ON!

00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:17.577
I'VE GOT
THE GREEN LIGHT!

00:12:22.715 --> 00:12:25.185
AND I ACTIVATE
MY SPEED SPELL!

00:12:25.185 --> 00:12:27.187
SILVER CONTRAILS!

00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:31.324
Duel runner computer:
SILVER CONTRAILS
IS A SPEED SPELL

00:12:31.324 --> 00:12:34.327
THAT GIVES ONE WIND ATTRIBUTE
MONSTER ON YOUR FIELD

00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:36.896
ONE THOUSAND
ADDITIONAL ATTACK POINTS.

00:12:38.898 --> 00:12:42.569
Yusei: NOW BECAUSE
STARDUST DRAGON
IS A WIND ATTRIBUTE MONSTER,

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:44.437
HE GETS A POWER BOOST.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.043
IT'S TIME OUR BEASTS TUSSLE!

00:12:50.043 --> 00:12:52.612
STARDUST... ICE HIS
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND!

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:54.714
GO COSMIC FLARE!

00:12:58.017 --> 00:13:00.353
Both: UHH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:13:00.353 --> 00:13:03.156
WHY'S MY ARM HURTING?
WHAT IS THIS?

00:13:09.796 --> 00:13:14.334
OH! OH! AMAZING!
INCREDIBLE! FANTASTIC!

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:16.402
OH! OH! OH!

00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:22.242
SORRY, YUSEI,
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.645
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SONIC CHICK!?

00:13:25.645 --> 00:13:28.448
MY SYNCHRO DEFLECTOR
TRAP CARD HAPPENED!

00:13:29.516 --> 00:13:31.351
WITH THIS TRAP CARD
I CAN REFLECT

00:13:31.351 --> 00:13:33.820
AN ATTACK AGAINST
A SYNCHRO MONSTER...

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.555
AND THEN
USE THE ENERGY...

00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:37.524
TO VAPORIZE THE MONSTER
ON YOUR FIELD

00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:39.959
WITH THE FEWEST
ATTACK POINTS.

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:41.628
AND NOW THAT
YOU'VE ATTACKED,

00:13:41.628 --> 00:13:43.463
THE EFFECT OF
YOUR SILVER CONTRAILS

00:13:43.463 --> 00:13:44.964
SPEED SPELL WEARS OFF,

00:13:44.964 --> 00:13:46.633
WHICH MEANS
YOUR STARDUST DRAGON

00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:49.736
LOSES ITS
PRECIOUS POWER BOOST!

00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:51.404
BUT IT'S
STILL MY TURN JACK

00:13:51.404 --> 00:13:53.406
AND I'M FAR FROM DONE.

00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:55.208
SO NEXT... FROM MY HAND,

00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:58.077
I SUMMON GHOST GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:02.815
TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR
LITTLE DRAGON, ARE YA?

00:14:02.815 --> 00:14:04.817
I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN...

00:14:04.817 --> 00:14:06.286
YOUR MOVE, JACK.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.855
UHH.

00:14:08.855 --> 00:14:10.223
Mina: INCOMING CALL, SIR.

00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:11.591
Goodwin: PUT IT ON SPEAKER.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:14.561
YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND
A LARGE SOLID OBJECT

00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:15.995
AND THEN DUCK BEHIND IT!

00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:17.463
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:14:17.463 --> 00:14:20.200
A MAJOR POWER SURGE!
IT'S OUTTA CONTROL!

00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:23.303
IF IT KEEPS UP,
THINGS ARE GONNA GET CRA-ZY!

00:14:24.537 --> 00:14:27.373
RECORD ALL
YOUR FINDINGS.

00:14:27.373 --> 00:14:29.175
AS YOU WISH, SIR.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.814
TIME TO END THIS, YUSEI.

00:14:38.618 --> 00:14:40.220
I THINK
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND

00:14:40.253 --> 00:14:42.455
WANTS TO ATTACK
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:14:45.825 --> 00:14:48.328
LET'S GO!
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND...

00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:51.130
TEAR THAT
STARDUST DRAGON APART!

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.633
GO SCORCHING
CRIMSON FLARE!

00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:56.903
HEY, GHOST GARDNA,
DOWN IN FRONT!

00:14:56.903 --> 00:14:58.605
GHOST GARDNA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:14:58.605 --> 00:15:00.607
ALLOWS IT TO DRAW
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTENTION

00:15:00.607 --> 00:15:02.475
AND BECOME THE TARGET
OF YOUR ATTACK.

00:15:02.475 --> 00:15:05.011
SO RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
WON'T BE ATTACKING STARDUST

00:15:05.011 --> 00:15:06.012
THIS TIME AROUND.

00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:07.714
N'AFTER IT
GETS DESTROYED...

00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:09.482
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
I KNOW!

00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:11.184
I WATCHED YOU USE
GHOST GARDNA

00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:13.152
PLENTY OF TIMES
BACK IN THE SATELLITE.

00:15:13.152 --> 00:15:15.021
AND THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME HOW...

00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:16.823
WHEN GHOST GARDNA
GETS DESTROYED,

00:15:16.823 --> 00:15:17.957
IT CAN LOWER
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:15:17.957 --> 00:15:19.459
OF ONE OF ITS
OPPONENT'S MONSTERS

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:21.828
BY ONE-THOUSAND UNTIL
THE END OF THE TURN.

00:15:21.828 --> 00:15:24.397
DID YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS COMING!?

00:15:24.397 --> 00:15:26.399
WELL, DID YOU KNOW
THIS WAS COMING?

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:28.968
I ACTIVATE A TRAP CARD!

00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:30.670
COUNTERATTACK BEACON!

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.772
AND IT ACTIVATES WHEN
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:15:32.772 --> 00:15:34.040
ATTACKS ONE OF MINE

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.009
AND MANAGES
TO DESTROY IT IN BATTLE.

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:38.044
ONCE THIS TRAP CARD ACTIVATES...

00:15:38.044 --> 00:15:39.679
IT NOT ONLY GIVES
ONE OF MY MONSTERS

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:41.114
FIVE-HUNDRED
MORE ATTACK POINTS...

00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:43.149
IT FORCES THAT
SAME MONSTER TO ATTACK

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:45.184
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT MY TURN.

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:48.621
VERY INTERESTING.

00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:50.690
SO NOW STARDUST
HAS MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.891
THAN MY DRAGON.

00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:53.092
THAT'S RIGHT, JACK!

00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:54.827
CAN YA' SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING?

00:15:54.827 --> 00:15:59.565
STARDUST DRAGON,
ATTA... ATTACK!

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:02.568
NOT BAD, YUSEI...

00:16:02.568 --> 00:16:04.837
BUT "NOT BAD"
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:16:04.837 --> 00:16:08.274
NOT WHEN I'VE GOT...
THE PRIDEFUL ROAR TRAP CARD.

00:16:08.274 --> 00:16:10.843
FOR THE LOW COST OF
ONE-THOUSAND LIFE POINTS...

00:16:10.843 --> 00:16:12.412
I CAN GIVE
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND

00:16:12.412 --> 00:16:15.014
THIRTEEN-HUNDRED MORE
ATTACK POINTS!

00:16:19.018 --> 00:16:21.888
OH DEAR ME THIS IS
A RISKY STRATEGY

00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:24.090
EVEN FOR SOMEONE
LIKE JACK ATLAS.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.526
HE'S EITHER VERY CONFIDENT
OR VERY FOOLISH

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:28.161
OR MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH,

00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.395
BUT EITHER WAY...

00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:31.431
THIS COULD END UP
EMBARRASSING HIM.

00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:32.865
IT'S SHOW TIME!

00:16:39.939 --> 00:16:41.174
[GROANING]

00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:43.576
[GROANING]

00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:52.385
AAH! OHH!

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:04.130
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.799
THAT ATTACK SHOULD'VE
DESTROYED STARDUST DRAGON!

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.268
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
HAS MORE ATTACK POINTS,

00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:10.503
IT'S MORE POWERFUL!

00:17:11.537 --> 00:17:14.374
SHIELD WARRIOR?
YOU CAN'T PLAY THAT CARD,

00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:16.209
I SENT THAT
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:17:16.242 --> 00:17:18.945
WHICH IS JUST WHERE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
CAN ACTIVATE.

00:17:18.945 --> 00:17:21.381
ALL I GOTTA DO IS
REMOVE IT FROM PLAY...

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:22.615
AND THEN, I CAN
USE ITS POWER

00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:25.218
TO SAVE A MONSTER
FROM BEING DESTROYED.

00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:27.587
BUT DON'T WORRY, JACK,
YOUR DRAGON'S ATTACK

00:17:27.587 --> 00:17:29.756
STILL HITS ME
FOR 300 LIFE POINTS.

00:17:29.756 --> 00:17:31.958
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
PRIDEFUL ROAR'S EFFECT

00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.459
WEARS OFF
AFTER AN ATTACK,

00:17:33.459 --> 00:17:35.561
SO RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
IS BACK TO ITS

00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:37.163
ORIGINAL POWER LEVEL.

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:42.101
I CAN STILL FINISH YOU.

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:46.172
WITH A SPEED SPE...
[GROANING] NOT AGAIN...

00:17:46.172 --> 00:17:49.108
UHH! WHAT IS WITH
THIS PAIN IN MY ARM!?

00:17:49.108 --> 00:17:51.377
WHAT KEEPS CAUSING IT!?
UHH!

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:55.081
WHAT THE...?
WHY IS MY ARM GLOWING!?

00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:57.049
HEY, YUSEI...
YOU DOIN' THIS!?

00:17:57.049 --> 00:18:00.019
Engineer: PROFESSOR!
THE REACTOR
HAS REACHED ITS MAX!...

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:01.587
THIS PLACE IS GONNA BLOW!!

00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:04.056
AHH! UHH! UHH! AAH!

00:18:25.948 --> 00:18:27.216
HUH?

00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:32.355
WHAT IS THAT?

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:35.424
UHH. WHAT KIND OF TRICK
IS THIS YUSEI?!

00:18:35.424 --> 00:18:37.159
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL?

00:18:42.898 --> 00:18:44.533
[GASP]

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:46.569
[GASP]

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:51.874
INCREDIBLE...

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:55.945
[YUSEI AND JACK GROANING]

00:18:55.945 --> 00:18:57.513
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M LOOKING AT!

00:18:57.513 --> 00:18:59.982
THE CORE REACTOR'S
GOING CRAZY!

00:18:59.982 --> 00:19:01.384
SEE...!...SPACE AND TIME
ARE BENDING

00:19:01.384 --> 00:19:02.852
IN DIRECTIONS I NEVER
IMAGINED POSSIBLE,

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:04.286
ATOMS ARE SMASHING
INTO EACH OTHER,

00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:06.489
QUANTUM PARTICLES
ARE COLLIDING
IN UNSTABLE WAYS!

00:19:06.489 --> 00:19:08.190
WHOSE DRAGON IS THAT?

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.092
[GROANING]

00:19:10.092 --> 00:19:11.961
I'LL TEACH YOU
TO PLAY TRICKS WITH ME!

00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:15.731
I ACTIVATE A SPEED SPELL!
END OF STORM!

00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:17.666
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
WE GOTTA STOP!

00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:19.268
NO WAY, YUSEI!

00:19:20.002 --> 00:19:21.137
ALRIGHT, FINE!

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.305
BUT I THINK WE'RE
GONNA REGRET THIS.

00:19:23.305 --> 00:19:25.975
I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD! UHH!

00:19:25.975 --> 00:19:27.243
UHH!

00:19:39.688 --> 00:19:41.424
OHH!

00:19:41.424 --> 00:19:42.425
Lazar: OOH!

00:19:42.425 --> 00:19:43.893
WHO TURNED OUT
THE LIGHTS?

00:19:43.893 --> 00:19:47.196
THE MIGHTY BEAST HAS
EMERGED FROM ITS SLUMBER...

00:19:52.902 --> 00:19:55.304
OH. LOOKS LIKE
WE SWITCHED

00:19:55.304 --> 00:19:56.972
TO THE BACK-UP
GENERATOR.

00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:01.811
WE'VE LOST
ALL VISUALS, SIR!

00:20:02.878 --> 00:20:05.114
I'VE SEEN ALL I NEED TO SEE...

00:20:35.377 --> 00:20:38.047
UHH. UHH.

00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:41.917
WHAT... WAS THAT?

00:20:45.554 --> 00:20:49.425
OUCH!...IT BURNS... HUH?

00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:55.564
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

00:20:55.564 --> 00:20:57.533
Jack: SO IT'S NOT JUST ME?

00:20:58.567 --> 00:21:01.070
JACK... WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:11.247
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS JACK?...

00:21:12.414 --> 00:21:14.650
YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

00:21:19.355 --> 00:21:21.690
FIRST THE ENERGY
WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.958
IT BROKE
ALL THE COUNTERS.

00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.860
THEN THE GENERATOR
WENT BALLISTIC ON ITSELF

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.595
AND NOW IT SEEMS
THE PARTICLE ROTATOR

00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:28.097
HAS STOPPED ROTATING
WHICH MEANS......

00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:29.865
WELL, IT MEANS
IT'S BROKEN.

00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:31.600
JUST DO WHATEVER
YOU HAVE TO DO

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.569
TO GET POWER
BACK TO THE CITY.

00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:34.837
OK...

00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:37.907
WHAT ABOUT MR. ATLAS?

00:21:44.914 --> 00:21:47.683
JACK...
SAY SOMETHING, MAN...

00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:50.252
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:21:51.086 --> 00:21:52.321
UHH!

00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:54.757
Security guard:
YOU ARE IN VIOLATION
OF CODE 36-B,

00:21:54.757 --> 00:21:56.792
WHICH STATES THAT
NO RESIDENTS OF SATELLITE

00:21:56.792 --> 00:21:58.193
MAY ENTER NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:00.362
BY ORDER OF THE SOCIAL
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT,

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.197
WE ARE PLACING YOU
UNDER ARREST.

00:22:02.197 --> 00:22:05.100
DO NOT TRY TO RUN.
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.

00:22:08.904 --> 00:22:11.440
OH MAN, I GOT
MAJOR PROBLEMS...

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.944
I GOT NO ESCAPE AND EVEN
IF I DID MANAGE TO GET AWAY,

00:22:14.944 --> 00:22:16.946
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT THING ON MY ARM WAS...
