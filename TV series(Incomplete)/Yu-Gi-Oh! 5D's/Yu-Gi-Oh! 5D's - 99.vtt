00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.137
Announcer: YES, DUEL FANS,

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.173
THE TOURNAMENT OF TITANS
HAS ARRIVED.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.176
THE WORLD RACING GRAND PRIX
IS FINALLY HERE.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:12.579
SO LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.248
Lester: AT LAST, IT BEGINS.

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:17.651
AT LAST, OUR GRAND DESIGN
SHALL COME TO PASS,

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.955
SO LONG AS JAKOB WAS CORRECT
IN HIS CALCULATIONS.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.224
I JUST WANTED TO
WISH YOU GOOD LUCK

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:26.159
AND TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR ARM.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.795
OH. WELL, THANKS,

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.664
AND GOOD LUCK
TO YOU GUYS, TOO.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:33.166
THIS MATCH IS CERTAIN
TO BE A CLASSIC.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.402
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HERE FOR,

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.471
TO GIVE ALL THE FANS
OUT THERE A GOOD SHOW.

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.307
AND SO FAR,
THE SHOW'S GOING
ACCORDING TO SCRIPT.

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.308
HUH?

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:43.010
HERE WE GO, ANDRE.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.112
THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER
MEETS THE ROAD,

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.548
WHERE MY POWER DECK
MEETS YOURS

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:49.216
IN A FIGHT
TO THE FINISH.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.918
MM-HMM.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.856
NOW LET HIM HAVE IT,
ARCHFIEND.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.259
ATTACK WITH
ABSOLUTE POWERFORCE.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.295
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP DIFFERENT

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.830
DIMENSION BARRIER
LOST FORCE.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.499
NOW THE DAMAGE
YOUR ARCHFIEND

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:06.733
WAS ABOUT
TO INFLICT ON ME

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.202
IS DEFLECTED
BACK TO YOU.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.204
AGH!

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.840
TEAM UNICORN'S BEEN PLAYING US
FROM THE START.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.442
IT WASN'T JUST
SOME ACCIDENT

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.811
THAT THEY CHALLENGED US
TO A DUEL AT THAT PRACTICE.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.613
WAIT. SO THEN
YOU'RE SAYING

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.148
WHEN BREO FELL
IN FRONT OF ME,

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.449
THAT WAS PLANNED
ON PURPOSE?

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.952
TEAM UNICORN WANTED US
TO THINK THAT ANDRE

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.553
WOULD BE DUELING FIRST
FOR THEM

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:28.522
AND BE USING A POWER DECK
IN THAT DUEL

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:30.190
BECAUSE IF WE THOUGHT THAT,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.892
THEN WE WOULD
MOST LIKELY SELECT JACK

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:33.961
TO BE THE FIRST DUELIST
FOR OUR TEAM.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:37.531
BECAUSE THEY HAD
A SPECIAL ANTI-POWER DECK
ALL READY TO GO.

00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.567
I PLAY THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.103
NOW BY REMOVING
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.705
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:47.507
FOR EVERY SPEED SPELL CARD
THAT I POSSESS IN MY HAND.

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.443
AH!

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:52.245
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU LOSE.

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.920
OH, NO!

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:03.357
AAH!

HAS JUST BEEN DECIMATED.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.963
LET'S HOPE HE'S OK.

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.098
JACK!

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:20.834
IF ONLY HE HAD TAKEN
THAT PIT STOP LIKE WE ASKED.

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:21.902
YUSEI?

00:03:21.902 --> 00:03:23.537

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:26.106

JACK, YOU OK?

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.708
STAY BACK.
HUH?

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.476
YOU KNOW
THE RULES, YUSEI.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.344
IF YOU TOUCH
A TEAMMATE'S
DUEL RUNNER

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:32.779
DURING THE COURSE
OF THE MATCH,

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:34.281
THE TEAM'S
DISQUALIFIED.

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.350
SO JUST TURN AROUND
AND GET BACK TO
THE PIT BOOTH NOW!

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.454

NO BUTS. GO!

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.755
Announcer: UNBELIEVABLE.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.123
JACK ATLAS
IS ATTEMPTING TO RIGHT

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:45.392
HIS WRECKED RUNNER
ALL BY HIMSELF,

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.760
AND HE HAD BETTER HURRY

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.463
BECAUSE UNLESS HE CAN MAKE IT
TO THE LAP LINE IN TIME,

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.666
TEAM 5D's NEXT DUELIST WON'T BE
ABLE TO TAKE THE FIELD,

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.835
AND THAT MEANS GAME OVER.

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.637
CAN JACK ATLAS
PASS THE BATON TO AKIZA,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.573
OR WILL SHE AND TEAM 5D's
BE FORCED

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.442
TO WATCH THE TOURNAMENT
ON THE TELEVISION?

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:06.680
HE'LL NEVER MAKE IT.
THIS DUEL IS ALL OURS.

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:12.152
OH, JACK. POOR GUY.
HE'S HURT.

Announcer: AND AS JACK ATLAS

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:34.241
PAINSTAKINGLY PUSHES HIS DUEL
RUNNER TOWARDS THE LAP LINE,

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:37.244
ANDRE OF TEAM UNICORN
TEARS AROUND THE TRACK.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.279
THIS'LL BE
A CLOSE ONE.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.347
WHAT WILL?

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:42.215
ACCORDING TO
THE GRAND PRIX RULES,

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:44.050
FOR EVERY LAP
A TEAM FALLS BEHIND,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.653
THE OPPOSING TEAM
GAINS A SPEED COUNTER.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.389
TEAM UNICORN'S
SPEED COUNTERS

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.625
ARE ALREADY
AT THE MAXIMUM OF 12.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.527
SO FOR EVERY LAP
THEY GAIN,

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:56.196
OUR SPEED COUNTERS
WILL DECREASE BY ONE.

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.431
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
FOUR COUNTERS.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.300
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE
GO DOWN TO ZERO?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.136
IF OUR SPEED COUNTER
TALLY DROPS DOWN
TO ZERO,

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.138
THEN WE'RE GOING
TO BE DISQUALIFIED.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.574

TURNED OUT BETTER FOR US.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.712
NOT ONLY WILL
TEAM 5D's LOSE,

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.549
BUT IT WILL BE A SLOW
AND PAINFUL LOSS.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:17.517
ANDRE JUST NEEDS TO COMPLETE
FOUR MORE LAPS,

00:05:17.517 --> 00:05:18.985
AND WE'LL HAVE WON.

IF I DON'T DO THIS,

I'LL REGRET IT FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.672

TO MAKE THE SWITCH OFFICIAL,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.735

IS A LEVEL 8 PLANT-TYPE MONSTER

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:56.903
WITH 2200 ATTACK POINTS
AND 0 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.638
NOW, PHOENIXIAN AMARYLLIS,

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:02.275
LET'S SHOW
THAT UNICORN KNIGHT
SOME REAL FLOWER POWER.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.721
AND NOW PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS'
SPECIAL ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:18.458
YOU SEE,
WHENEVER SHE ATTACKS,
SHE'S DESTROYED,

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.859
AND WHENEVER
SHE'S DESTROYED,
SHE DESTROYS

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.796
AN 800-POINT CHUNK
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS, TOO.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:24.230
OH!

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.966
NOT BAD.
SHE'S GOT SKILLS.

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:30.136
NEXT, I'LL PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END MY TURN,

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.038
BUT THAT DOESN'T
END THINGS FOR AMARYLLIS

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.474
BECAUSE NOW, BY REMOVING
ONE PLANT-TYPE MONSTER

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:35.975
IN MY GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY,

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.778
SHE'S RESURRECTED
BACK TO THE FIELD.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.283
WELCOME BACK,
PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER.

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.553
OH, AMAZING!
ALL RIGHT!

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:47.887
GO, AKIZA.

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.522
YEAH. SHE SURE
SHOWED HIM.

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:53.359
WELL, WELL, WELL.
SHE STARTED OFF QUICK.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.494
SHE HAD TO.

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:56.729
ANDRE HAS 12
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:59.466
AND THAT MEANS
HE CAN USE ANY AND
ALL SPEED SPELLS.

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:01.367
THAT GIVES HIM
A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

00:10:01.367 --> 00:10:02.402
YOU'LL SEE.

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:03.803
ONCE ANDRE
TAKES HIS TURN,

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:05.505
HE'LL ALSO TAKE
CONTROL OF THIS DUEL,

00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:07.173
AND AKIZA WON'T
STAND A CHANCE.

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.876
ANYBODY CAN START OFF
A DUEL STRONGLY.

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:13.012
IT'S HOW YOU FINISH THAT
REALLY MATTERS, THOUGH.

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.015
YOU'VE GOT
A POINT, JEAN,

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.650
ESPECIALLY SINCE
ANDRE STILL HAS

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.153
THAT END OF THE STORM
SPEED SPELL CARD.

00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.154
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:23.189
SINCE HE HAS
12 SPEED COUNTERS,

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.091
HE'S FREE TO USE IT,
WHICH MEANS HE'S FREE

00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:27.327
TO DESTROY ALL MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:29.496
AND DELIVER
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:32.298
FOR EACH OF THOSE MONSTERS
TO WHOEVER OWNS THEM.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.868
RIGHT NOW, ANDRE
HAS NO MONSTERS OUT.

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:37.704
SO AKIZA WOULD BE
THE ONLY ONE AFFECTED.

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:40.306
[THINKING]
IF PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER
AMARYLLIS' ABILITY

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.910
IS ACTIVATED AGAIN,
IT WILL DEAL ME 800
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.880
THAT'LL LEAVE ME WITH
700 LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.549
HOWEVER, ONCE AKIZA
HAS FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:52.385
SHE'LL BE ABLE
TO USE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.487
AND TAKE OUT
MY REMAINING 700.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.223
SO, CLEARLY, WHAT
AKIZA IS HOPING FOR

00:10:57.223 --> 00:11:00.527
IS THAT I'LL DESTROY
HER PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS.

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:02.762
[THINKING]
WHAT I'M HOPING FOR
IS THAT ANDRE

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:05.064
DESTROYS PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:08.535
EITHER WITH A MONSTER OR WITH
THE END OF THE STORM CARD.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.538
[THINKING]
WHAT TO DO? WHAT TO DO?

00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:15.241
WELL, NOT WHAT AKIZA WANTS ME
TO DO, THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.743
MY TURN.

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:19.212
[BEEP]

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:21.414
[THINKING]
THIS'LL COME IN HANDY.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:24.884
I'M ACTIVATING
THE SPEED SPELL
KNOWN AS DASH PILFER.

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:28.621
WITH THIS, SINCE
I HAVE AT LEAST
FOUR SPEED COUNTERS,

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.690
I'M ALLOWED
TO TAKE CONTROL
OF A MONSTER OF YOURS

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.592
THAT'S IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.794
HUH? HUH?

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.700
NEXT, I SUMMON UNIBIRD.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.037
[SCREECHES]

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.872
AND NOW I'LL PLAY
HIS ABILITY.

00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.007
SEE, BY REMOVING
UNIBIRD FROM PLAY

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.776
AND A MONSTER ON
MY FIELD FROM PLAY,

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.778
I CAN SUMMON A SYNCHRO
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:55.114
AS LONG AS ITS LEVEL
ISN'T HIGHER THAN THE
MONSTER I JUST REMOVED.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:56.482
[THINKING]
OH, NO.

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.851
NOT ONLY DID HE NOT USE
END OF THE STORM,

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:00.486
BUT HE TOOK CONTROL
OF MY MONSTER

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.422
AND TOOK IT OUT OF PLAY.

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:05.391
NOW I HAVE NO WAY
TO DEAL HIM ANY DAMAGE.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:07.961
INTRODUCING THE SYNCHRO
I'M SUMMONING BACK--

00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.395
THUNDER UNICORN.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:13.700
[WHINNIES]

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.173
NOW, MY PET,
ATTACK AKIZA DIRECTLY.

00:12:20.173 --> 00:12:22.542
SUPER CHARGER BOLT.

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.845
AAH!

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.847
♪♪

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:35.488
♪♪

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.761
THUNDER UNICORN, GO.

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.198
ATTACK WITH
SUPER CHARGER BOLT.

00:12:45.198 --> 00:12:46.499
AAH!

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.103
OH...

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:51.504
RRGH.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:57.644
AND NOW I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:58.645
ALL RIGHT!

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:00.880
ANDRE TOOK AKIZA'S
AMARYLLIS OUT OF PLAY

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.850
WITHOUT ACTIVATING ITS ABILITY
AND SUMMONED A MONSTER.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:06.853
OF COURSE,
ANDRE COULD'VE WON
THE MATCH THIS TURN

00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.188
IF HE'D
USED THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2.

00:13:09.188 --> 00:13:12.058
UH, YEAH.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.494
WITH DASH PILFER
AND THE END OF THE STORM,

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.496
HE HAD TWO SPEED SPELLS.

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:18.197
WITH SPEED WORLD 2's
EFFECT,

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:20.533
FOR EVERY FOUR
SPEED COUNTERS HE REMOVED,

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:24.037
HE WOULD'VE DEALT 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE PER SPEED SPELL.

00:13:24.037 --> 00:13:27.340
IN OTHER WORDS, HE COULD HAVE
DEALT 1600 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.475
THREE TIMES OVER.

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:31.744
RIGHT, BUT HAD
ANDRE DONE THAT,

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.780
HE WOULD'VE THEN HAD
TO FACE YUSEI FUDO

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.581
WITHOUT ANY
SPEED COUNTERS.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:39.319
SO THAT'S WHY HE HELD BACK,
TO BE READY FOR YUSEI.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.920
AKIZA STARTED
WITH A BANG,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.056
BUT NOW SHE'S GETTIN'
ALL BANGED UP.

00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:44.924
TELL US IT'S NOT
HOPELESS, YUSEI.

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:46.259
IT'S NOT.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.262
AKIZA AND I HATCHED A SECRET
PLAN BEFORE SHE WENT OUT.

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:50.897
WHADAYA MEAN,
SECRET PLAN?

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:53.533
JUST WATCH THE DUEL, CROW.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:57.537
[THINKING] COME ON, AKIZA.
JUST WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

00:13:57.537 --> 00:14:01.207
[THINKING]
ANDRE HAS EVERY ADVANTAGE
RIGHT NOW EXCEPT FOR ONE,

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.076
AND IT'S ONE
HE'LL NEVER SEE COMING.

00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:05.445
I MEAN, I SURE DIDN'T.

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:06.779
I'M OFF.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.448
HERE.
HUH?

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:10.316
GO ON.
TAKE IT, AKIZA.

00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:14.687
BUT, YUSEI,
ARE YOU SURE?

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.390
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE MOST
OBVIOUS DUEL STRATEGY,

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.991
BUT THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT PERFECT.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.194
NOW GET OUT THERE

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.330
AND WIN THIS DUEL
LIKE I KNOW YOU CAN.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.666
[THINKING]
YUSEI MAY THINK
I CAN WIN THIS DUEL,

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:29.402
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOES RIGHT NOW.

00:14:29.402 --> 00:14:32.271
OH, WELL. GUESS THAT MEANS
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE,

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:33.873
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE,

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.808
YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING
TO GAIN.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.711
IT'S MY DRAW!

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.779
[BEEP]

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.282
ALL RIGHT. THIS'LL WORK.

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:47.253
FROM MY HAND, I SUMMON
WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST...

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:53.292
AND THIS WITCH IS BREWING UP
SOMETHING SPECIAL

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.660
BECAUSE NOW THAT
SHE'S SUMMONED,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.963
I CAN DRAW ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK,

00:14:56.963 --> 00:15:01.567
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE CARD
I DREW IS ROSE FAIRY.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.770
AND SINCE THIS CARD
WAS ADDED TO MY HAND

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.640
BY WAY OF A MONSTER'S SPECIAL
ABILITY, I CAN NOW SUMMON IT.

00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:16.015
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED SPELL ANGEL BATON...

00:15:18.017 --> 00:15:19.919
AND SINCE I HAVE FOUR
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:22.155
I CAN NOW DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:24.390
AS LONG AS I
THEN DISCARD ONE,

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.826
AND THE CARD THAT I'M
BANISHING TO MY GRAVEYARD

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.528
IS GLOW-UP BULB.

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:31.030
NOW, LEVEL 4 WITCH
OF THE BLACK FOREST,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.666
TUNE WITH LEVEL 3
ROSE FAIRY.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.639
LET THE SPIRIT
OF THE EARTH INTERTWINE

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.908
WITH THE ESSENCE OF THE SKY.

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:45.678
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE BLACK ROSE DRAGON.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.280
[ROARING]

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.752
SO IT'S HERE, AKIZA'S
MOST ULTIMATE MONSTER.

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:54.387
THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING.

00:15:54.387 --> 00:15:55.755
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET.

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:59.725
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP CARD STAR SIPHON.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.561
THANKS TO THIS CARD,

00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:04.197
WHEN A SYNCHRO MONSTER
IS SUMMONED TO THE FIELD,

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.199
I GET TO SUMMON
A STAR SIPHON TOKEN,

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.968
AND THEN I'M ALLOWED
TO SWAP LEVELS WITH IT.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:16.242
NEXT, BY SENDING THE TOP CARD
ON MY DECK TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:16.242 --> 00:16:19.946
I'M ALLOWED TO GROW BACK
THIS OLD FRIEND--GLOW-UP BULB.

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:24.884
GO, LEVEL 1
GLOW-UP BULB.

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:27.553
TUNE WITH LEVEL 7
STAR SIPHON TOKEN.

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:30.022
NOW OUT OF TWO
WILL COME ONE,

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:32.825
AND OUT OF ONE WILL COME
GREAT COSMIC MIGHT.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.826
NO WAY!

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:35.561
IS IT?
IT CAN'T BE.

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:37.196
THIS ONE'S
FOR YOU, YUSEI.

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:43.503
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE STARDUST DRAGON.

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:48.808
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:50.510
STARDUST DRAGON?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.211
HMM, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:53.980
I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.016
BUT BEFORE
I GET TO HIM, HERE.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:00.286
FEEL THE WRATH
OF BLACK ROSE DRAGON.

00:17:00.286 --> 00:17:01.521
[ROARING]

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.791
UNGH! UGH!

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.260
OH, NO.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.195
IF THIS NEXT ATTACK
GETS THROUGH--

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.863
THEN YOU'D BETTER
START SUITING UP.

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.965
I'LL SAY.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:14.233
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.902
YEAH!
GO, AKIZA!

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:20.339
NOW TO END THIS.
STARDUST DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.807
HUH?

00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:22.975
YOU CAN'T ATTACK.

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:26.412
THE BATTLE PHASE
IS ALREADY OVER

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.713
BECAUSE
I PLAYED THIS--

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:30.283
THE TRAP DIMENSION
EQUILIBRIUM.

00:17:30.283 --> 00:17:31.584
HUH?

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:34.487
WITH THIS CARD,
WHEN A MONSTER IS
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:17:34.487 --> 00:17:36.923
BY REMOVING THE MONSTER
THAT DID THE INITIAL
ATTACKING FROM PLAY,

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:40.326
I CAN RESURRECT
THE MONSTER THAT
WAS DESTROYED.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:45.598
NOW THEN, GO RIGHT AHEAD
AND END YOUR TURN.

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:48.334
VERY WELL.
YOU'VE BOUGHT SOME TIME.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:52.605
I'LL PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN TO END THE ROUND.

00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:54.574
OH, AKIZA'S
NOT DONE YET.

00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:58.177

A CLOSE ONE.

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:01.681
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT
ON THE FIELD DUELING,

00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.449
YOU'RE STILL A THREAT.

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.684
FINE, THEN.

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:06.052
OH.

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:15.261
[THINKING] JEAN WANTS ME TO QUIT
HOLDING BACK AND END THE DUEL.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.597
GUESS HE WANTS TO FACE YUSEI
HERE AND NOW,

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.231
AND I DON'T BLAME HIM.

00:18:19.231 --> 00:18:20.800
AT LEAST IF WE GET HIM
ON THE FIELD,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.770
WE CAN TAKE HIM ON DIRECTLY,
AND NOT JUST HIS MONSTERS.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.205
MY TURN.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:27.273
[BEEP]

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.242
I ACTIVATE THE SPEED

00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:32.612
WITH THIS CARD,
I MULTIPLY THE NUMBER

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.880
OF SPEED COUNTERS
I HAVE BY 200

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.716
AND THEN AM ALLOWED
TO ADD THAT TOTAL

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:39.452
TO THE ATTACK POINTS
OF ONE OF MY MONSTERS.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.354
I HAVE 12
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:18:41.354 --> 00:18:43.923
SO THAT'S
2400 ATTACK POINTS

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.992
FOR THUNDER UNICORN.

00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:47.927

CHARGER BOLT.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.494
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:27.700
HALF OF THUNDER UNICORN'S
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.569
ARE NOW ADDED
TO STARDUST DRAGON.

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:37.143

FOR EVERY SPEED SPELL
IN MY HAND,

TO FINISH YOU OFF, SO--
