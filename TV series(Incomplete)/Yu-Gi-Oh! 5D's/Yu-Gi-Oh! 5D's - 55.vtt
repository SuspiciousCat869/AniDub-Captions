00:10:09.065 --> 00:10:10.366
YOU CAN'T
FOOL US.

00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:11.301
BUT THAT'S CUTE
THAT YOU'RE

00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.268
TRYING TO TAKE
THE FALL

00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:14.003
AND PROTECT YOUR
LITTLE FRIEND.

00:10:14.003 --> 00:10:15.872
[SNICKERS]

00:10:15.872 --> 00:10:17.473
INTO THE WAGON,
KID.

00:10:19.876 --> 00:10:23.580
GOOD JOB.
[SNICKERS]

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.284
[MOANING]
HOW COULD YOU!

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:30.086
YUSEI! YOU SNITCH!

00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:32.522
HOW COULD YOU SELL OUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND LIKE THIS!

00:10:32.522 --> 00:10:34.290
YOU'RE WRONG, KALIN!
I...

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.092
AAH!

00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:38.328
MARK MY WORDS,
YOU'LL PAY, TRAITOR!

00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:41.264
YUSEI...!

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:47.604
KALIN... I'M SORRY!

00:10:49.372 --> 00:10:51.274
THINGS WERE GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:53.409
THE RIOTS
AND THE FIGHTING
HAD TO STOP,

00:10:53.409 --> 00:10:54.677
YOU HAD TO STOP...

00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:56.646
BUT I WAS TRYING
TO HELP YOU, KALIN,

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:58.581
I WAS TRYING
TO SAVE YOU.

00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:00.483
YOU THINK I BELIEVE YOU?

00:11:00.483 --> 00:11:01.484
YOU SOLD ME OUT, MAN!

00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:03.353
NOT TRUE!
YUSEI WAS TRYING

00:11:03.353 --> 00:11:05.088
TO SURRENDER TO
SECTOR SECURITY

00:11:05.088 --> 00:11:06.289
IN YOUR PLACE!

00:11:06.289 --> 00:11:07.690
NOBODY SHOULD'VE
SURRENDERED.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.692
WE SHOULD'VE STOOD UP
TO THEM TOGETHER!

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:11.527
YOU BACKED DOWN
WHEN THINGS GOT TOUGH,

00:11:11.527 --> 00:11:14.764
YOU LET SECTOR SECURITY
TAKE OVER SATELLITE!

00:11:14.764 --> 00:11:18.468
SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU DID BETRAY ME!

00:11:18.468 --> 00:11:19.836
I WANTED TO HELP YOU.

00:11:19.836 --> 00:11:22.038
WELL, WITH HELP LIKE YOURS,
WHO NEEDS HELP?

00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:25.074
BESIDES, IF YOU CARED
SO MUCH ABOUT ME,

00:11:25.074 --> 00:11:27.543
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
VISIT ME IN THE FACILITY?...

00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:28.544
HUH YUSEI!

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.847
WE TRIED TO VISIT YOU,
PLENTY OF TIMES!

00:11:30.847 --> 00:11:32.081
BUT EVERY TIME
WE CAME BY,

00:11:32.081 --> 00:11:33.917
THEY TURNED US AWAY...

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:36.886
MAN, I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT THEY DID TO YOU
IN THERE.

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:39.622
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T,
OLD FRIEND!

00:11:39.622 --> 00:11:43.092
I COULDA HANDLED THE INSULTS
AND THE SOLITUDE, BUT THEY...

00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:45.261
THEY TOOK
MY DECK FROM ME.

00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:48.298
THAT DECK WAS MY LIFE!...

00:11:48.298 --> 00:11:51.401
Roman: HEAR MY VOICE...
I AM A MESSENGER

00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:53.269
FROM BEYOND THE TWILIGHT...

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:56.172
I CAN GRANT YOU A POWER
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN.

00:11:56.172 --> 00:11:59.809
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT
THE MARK OF A DARK SIGNER...

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:01.945
AND THEN... YOU WILL BE FREE.

00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:03.546
YOU WILL BE UNSTOPPABLE.

00:12:03.546 --> 00:12:04.881
YOU WILL DUEL AGAIN.

00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:08.017
AND FINALLY... YOU WILL
BE ABLE TO GET REVENGE

00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:10.353
ON ALL WHO HAVE OPPOSED YOU.

00:12:10.353 --> 00:12:14.624
GOOD... BUT I ONLY WANT
REVENGE ON ONE PERSON...

00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:15.892
JUST ONE...

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:21.464
I GAVE MYSELF
TO THE SHADOWS

00:12:21.464 --> 00:12:23.967
SO THAT I COULD
HAVE THIS ONE MOMENT!

00:12:23.967 --> 00:12:25.969
THIS MOMENT WHERE
I MAKE YOU FEEL

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:28.071
THE TERROR AND THE PAIN
THAT YOU MADE ME FEEL

00:12:28.071 --> 00:12:30.106
WHEN YOU TURNED
YOUR BACK ON ME!

00:12:30.106 --> 00:12:31.941
IT'S MY MOVE!!...

00:12:33.042 --> 00:12:35.845
AND I NOW RELEASE
INFERNITY ARCHFIEND...

00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:38.381
AND INFERNITY NECROMANCER....

00:12:43.653 --> 00:12:45.688
I SUMMON TO THE FIELD...

00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:48.491
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL
CCAPAC APU!

00:13:15.685 --> 00:13:18.554
OH MAN,
THAT THING IS HUGE!

00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:19.922
GEE, YA THINK?

00:13:19.922 --> 00:13:21.791
WITH THAT GUY OUT...

00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:23.259
IT'S THE END
OF THE LINE!

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:25.795
MAN, I'VE BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME TO SAY...

00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:29.866
"CCAPAC APU SEND YUSEI
TO THE NETHERWORLD!"

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.834
[THINKING] THE LAST TIME
WE DUELED

00:13:49.834 --> 00:13:51.969
AND HE SUMMONED THIS
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,

00:13:51.969 --> 00:13:53.304
MY DUEL RUNNER'S WHEEL BROKE

00:13:53.304 --> 00:13:56.340
BEFORE HE COULD ATTACK,
ENDING THE DUEL EARLY...

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.576
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN THIS TIME...

00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:00.878
THIS TIME I'M BRINGING
THAT EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL

00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:02.146
DOWN TO EARTH!

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:05.950
I HOPE THIS PLAN WORKS...
HERE GOES EVERYTHING...

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.787
I REVEAL MY TRAP CARD...
BATON OF THE HERO!

00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:11.756
AND WITH IT IN PLAY I'M
NOW ALLOWED TO CHOOSE

00:14:11.756 --> 00:14:13.524
THE TARGET OF
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK!

00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:14.792
SO THAT MEANS...

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:17.595
THAT YOUR IMMORTAL'S
ATTACKING SPEED WARRIOR!

00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:25.536
WAY TO THROW YOUR MONSTER
OUT AS A SHIELD, YUSEI.

00:14:25.536 --> 00:14:28.906
BUT THIS ATTACK ISN'T OVER!
NOT YET!

00:14:28.906 --> 00:14:30.641
'CAUSE WHEN YOUR MONSTER
GETS DESTROYED,

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:34.378
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL TO
YOUR MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:14:34.378 --> 00:14:35.613
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:36.981
WITH YUSEI'S
JUNK WARRIOR

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:38.516
PACKIN'
SO MUCH POWER.

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:39.550
IF HE DOESN'T
DO SOMETHING,

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.518
HE'S DONE FOR.

00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:41.552
COME ON, YUSEI....

00:14:41.552 --> 00:14:43.254
I ACTIVATE THIS KALIN...

00:14:43.254 --> 00:14:45.122
THE TRAP BURST
SYNCHRO SUMMON.

00:14:45.122 --> 00:14:48.159
NOW MY LIFE POINTS
ARE SAFE FROM TAKING
ANY DAMAGE.

00:14:50.828 --> 00:14:53.564
AND THEN, DUE TO
THE POWER OF MY TRAP

00:14:53.564 --> 00:14:54.799
I CAN BRING OUT
A MONSTER

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.100
WHOSE ATTACK POINTS
ARE THE SAME

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.302
AS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN.

00:14:58.302 --> 00:15:01.372
DOES YUSEI EVEN HAVE
SOMETHING THAT POWERFUL?

00:15:01.372 --> 00:15:03.074
ONLY STARDUST DRAGON!

00:15:03.074 --> 00:15:05.409
THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT!

00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:07.879
STARDUST DRAGON
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:17.455
WELL, YOU FINALLY
MANAGED TO SUMMON
YOUR FAVORITE MONSTER...

00:15:17.455 --> 00:15:20.191
DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK IT'S
GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:21.859
TIME TO FIND OUT!

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.663
NOT SO FAST!
I REVEAL THE TRAP CARD...

00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:27.131
BRILLIANT SHRINE ART!

00:15:27.131 --> 00:15:29.166
NOW WHEN YOU ATTACK,
YOUR MONSTER HAS TO FACE

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:31.736
MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL.

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:34.272
BUT MY STARDUST DRAGON
DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE

00:15:34.272 --> 00:15:36.340
AGAINST THAT THING...

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.575
I'M GONNA NEED
SOME BACK UP

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.610
SO I ACTIVATE
ANGEL BATON!

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.712
NOW I CAN DRAW TWO CARDS
AND SEND ONE

00:15:41.712 --> 00:15:43.514
FROM MY HAND
TO MY GRAVEYARD.

00:15:43.514 --> 00:15:45.216
AND THE CARD I SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:46.784
WAS STARDUST XIAOLONG,

00:15:46.784 --> 00:15:49.053
BUT WITH STARDUST DRAGON
ALREADY SUMMONED,

00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:51.122
XIAOLONG INSTANTLY
RESURRECTS TO THE FIELD

00:15:51.122 --> 00:15:52.390
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.562
NEXT I PLAY A FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:00.398
THIS IS GETTING GOOD YUSEI!

00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:03.601
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT
AND AFTER I PLAY

00:16:03.601 --> 00:16:05.436
MY TRAP
SUPERIOR PROTECTOR

00:16:05.436 --> 00:16:07.138
IT'S ONLY GONNA
GET BETTER.

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:09.874
SEE WITH
THIS CARD'S POWER...

00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:11.609
I CAN ONLY TAKE
BATTLE DAMAGE

00:16:11.609 --> 00:16:13.811
IF STARDUST DRAGON
BATTLES.

00:16:13.811 --> 00:16:16.614
ALL YOU'VE DONE IS
MADE YOUR DRAGON A TARGET!

00:16:16.614 --> 00:16:19.216
NOW ALL I NEED
TO DO IS CRUSH IT...

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:21.285
SO THAT I CAN CRUSH YOU!

00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:39.862
Kalin: LOOKS LIKE YOU
AND YOUR STARDUST DRAGON

00:16:39.862 --> 00:16:42.231
ARE ABOUT TO GET SENT
TO THE NETHERWORLD!

00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:45.901
NOT IF I SEND
SUPERIOR PROTECTOR

00:16:45.901 --> 00:16:48.137
TO THE GRAVEYARD
TO PROTECT US.

00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:52.675
NICE MOVE, BUT YOU'RE STILL
TAKIN' BATTLE DAMAGE!...

00:16:52.675 --> 00:16:55.277
AND THANKS TO MY LITTLE
WICKED TRAMPLE TRAP CARD...

00:16:55.277 --> 00:16:56.578
WHEN YOU TAKE
BATTLE DAMAGE FROM

00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:58.380
SOMETHING OTHER THAN
A DIRECT ATTACK,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.715
THAT DAMAGE IS DOUBLED!

00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:00.683
WHAT?!

00:17:00.683 --> 00:17:02.618
HA-HAAAA...!!

00:17:02.618 --> 00:17:05.454
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL!...
END THIS NOW!

00:17:06.689 --> 00:17:09.591
[GROANING]

00:17:14.763 --> 00:17:16.632
AAAAH!!

00:17:16.632 --> 00:17:20.035
KALIN!

00:17:20.035 --> 00:17:22.071
DON'T KNOW...
TAKE MY HAND!

00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:23.238
HUH?!

00:17:30.312 --> 00:17:31.380
YUSEI...

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.282
I MADE THE WRONG
CALL, KALIN.

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:34.550
I THOUGHT I COULD
HELP YOU,

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.418
I THOUGHT "MAYBE IF
I TAKE THE HEAT,

00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:38.153
KALIN'LL TURN
HIMSELF AROUND"...

00:17:38.153 --> 00:17:40.723
BUT I GET IT NOW...
YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS,

00:17:40.723 --> 00:17:41.924
I SHOULDA FOUND
A WAY FOR US

00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:43.258
TO FIX THINGS TOGETHER.

00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:44.927
I SHOULDA STOOD BY YOU.

00:17:44.927 --> 00:17:47.029

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:49.098
YUSEI...

00:17:55.104 --> 00:17:57.673
I CAN FEEL US ALL
DRAWING TOGETHER.

00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:02.478
JACK AND CROW FEEL
THE SAME WAY, KALIN.

00:18:02.478 --> 00:18:04.413
AND RIGHT NOW,
LIKE BACK THEN,

00:18:04.413 --> 00:18:05.881
WE'RE FIGHTING
ALONGSIDE OUR FRIENDS

00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:07.382
FOR SOMETHING
WE BELIEVE IN...

00:18:07.382 --> 00:18:09.118
BUT I'M NOT FIGHTING
TO DEFEAT YOU,

00:18:09.118 --> 00:18:10.652
YOU HAVE

00:18:10.652 --> 00:18:12.154
I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOU.

00:18:12.187 --> 00:18:13.555
I'M TRYING
TO SAVE MY FRIEND

00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:15.057
FROM THE DARK SIGNERS!

00:18:15.057 --> 00:18:18.927
YOUR "FRIEND"...
YOU CAN'T.

00:18:18.927 --> 00:18:20.095
IT'S TOO LATE.

00:18:20.095 --> 00:18:22.598
AAAARGH!!

00:18:22.598 --> 00:18:24.233
KALIN, NOOO...!

00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:28.437
[GASP]

00:18:28.437 --> 00:18:29.772
WHAT IN THE...?!

00:18:29.772 --> 00:18:31.073
THAT'S WEIRD...

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:38.380
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.316
OUR MARKS HAVE ALL
JOINED UP ON YUSEI.

00:18:41.316 --> 00:18:42.684
WE'RE ALL

00:18:46.355 --> 00:18:48.190
[THINKING] SOMETHING'S
CALLING TO ME...

00:18:50.058 --> 00:18:52.394
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT!

00:18:52.394 --> 00:18:54.930
OF COURSE, THAT'S
WHAT I'VE GOTTA DO!...

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.399
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS
AND I HAD TO BECOME A TEAM

00:18:57.399 --> 00:18:59.001
TO FIGHT THE DARK SIGNERS...

00:18:59.001 --> 00:19:01.770
MY MONSTERS HAVE TO UNITE
TO WIN THIS DUEL!

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.407
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS
I SUMMON MAJESTIC DRAGON

00:19:05.407 --> 00:19:07.543

00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:51.486
ARE POWERLESS AGAINST
MY MIGHTY DRAGON.

00:19:51.486 --> 00:19:54.122
IN FACT, MY DRAGON
CAN ABSORB THEM ALL

00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:55.724
AND USE THEM AGAINST YOU!

00:20:04.499 --> 00:20:07.903
AND NOW MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON

00:20:14.977 --> 00:20:16.445

00:20:29.725 --> 00:20:31.226
HANG ON, PAL!!

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:38.700
COME ON,
STAY WITH ME.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.602
I'M NOT GIVING UP
THIS TIME.

00:20:40.602 --> 00:20:42.671
THIS TIME,
I'M GONNA SAVE YOU.

00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:46.842
YUSEI... I SPENT YEARS
HATING YOU

00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:48.610
AND PLANNING MY REVENGE...

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.145
I LET MY ANGER DEVOUR ME

00:20:50.145 --> 00:20:53.382
AND I WILLINGLY GAVE MYSELF
TO THE DARKNESS...

00:20:53.382 --> 00:20:56.952
BUT IN BEATING ME, YUSEI...
YOU FOUND YOUR FRIEND,

00:20:56.952 --> 00:20:58.921
AND ALTHOUGH
THE SHADOWS AWAIT...

00:21:01.857 --> 00:21:04.660
I NEED YOU TO PROMISE ME
SOMETHING, YUSEI...

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.096
STOP BEATING YOURSELF UP
OVER WHAT HAPPENED...

00:21:08.096 --> 00:21:10.899
I'M THE ONE WHO REALLY
MESSED THINGS UP...

00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:13.068
BUT NOW FINALLY,
HERE AT THE VERY END,

00:21:13.068 --> 00:21:15.771
YOU DID WHAT YOU SET OUT
TO DO, YOU SAVED ME...

00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:19.374
[GASP] KALIN...

00:21:23.078 --> 00:21:25.948
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO AND DO
SOMETHING STUPID, LIKE...

00:21:25.948 --> 00:21:29.518
LOSE TO
THE DARK SIGNERS... ARE YOU?

00:21:31.586 --> 00:21:36.558
DON'T BACK DOWN, YUSEI...
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS...

00:21:36.558 --> 00:21:39.294
PUSH THE SHADOWS
BACK WHERE THEY BELONG.

00:21:43.498 --> 00:21:44.666
KALIN...

00:21:47.002 --> 00:21:48.770
Trudge: YUSEI

00:21:57.512 --> 00:22:00.449
[THINKING] THEY CAME TO YOU
WHEN YOU WERE AFRAID AND HURT...

00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:02.384
THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR PAIN,

00:22:02.384 --> 00:22:05.954
THEY TWISTED YOU SO THAT THEY
COULD USE YOU AS THEIR PAWN...

00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:07.589
THEY WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT...

00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:10.559

DARK SIGNERS WIN!

00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:14.763
