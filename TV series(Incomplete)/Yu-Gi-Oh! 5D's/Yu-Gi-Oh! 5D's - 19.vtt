I'VE DEVOTED MY ENTIRE
LIFE TO FINDING A WAY

00:18:34.648 --> 00:18:36.717
TO CONNECT TO THIS WORLD.

00:18:36.717 --> 00:18:39.153
NOW THAT I AM
FINALLY STANDING HERE...

00:18:39.153 --> 00:18:41.488
I INTEND TO STEAL
ITS POWER FOR MYSELF!

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:43.524
THE SPIRIT WORLD IS
GOING TO BE MINE!

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:45.225
IT WILL CRUMBLE
BEFORE ME!

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:47.461
AH HA HA HA!

00:18:51.532 --> 00:18:52.566
OHH! OH, NO.

00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:55.469
THE SPIRIT WORLD
IS COLLAPSING.

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:57.471
I CAN'T LET IT.
I CAN'T!

00:18:57.471 --> 00:18:59.006
IT'S TOO LATE
TO SAVE THIS WORLD

00:18:59.006 --> 00:19:00.474
OR YOUR KURIBON!

00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:03.277
IDO THE SUPREME
MAGICAL FORCE, ATTACK!

00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.682
STOP!

00:19:08.682 --> 00:19:10.484
I PLAY FAIRY WIND!

00:19:10.484 --> 00:19:14.221
Computer: FAIRY WIND DESTROYS
ALL THE MAGIC AND TRAP CARDS

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:16.156
ON THE FIELD AND DEALS
400 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:19:16.156 --> 00:19:19.493
TO EACH PLAYER
FOR EVERY CARD DESTROYED.

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:20.594
LISTEN UP,
PROFESSOR.

00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:21.662
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
DO ANY MORE DAMAGE

00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:24.164
TO THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.467
YOUR EVIL
AND DESTRUCTIVE
WAYS WILL END NOW!

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:27.468
WHAT!?

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:31.038
[CHIRPS]

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:37.344
HUH?

00:19:39.713 --> 00:19:41.682
ERR!

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:44.184
I GAVE MY WORD
TO PROTECT THIS WORLD,

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.453
AND THAT MEANS I'M
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
OUT YOUR PRECIOUS

00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:48.656
LIFE POINTS EVEN IF IT
MEANS RISKING MY OWN

00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:50.224
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:55.496
N' SINCE YOUR
EQUIP SPELL IS GONE NOW,

00:19:55.496 --> 00:19:59.133
KURIBON'S ATTACK
POINTS RETURN TO 300.

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:00.601
YOU WON'T WIN THIS DUEL.

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:04.304
AND YOU WILL NOT STOP
ME FROM ACHIEVING
MY DESTINY!

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:07.007
ATTACK NOW, IDO!

00:20:07.007 --> 00:20:09.343
KURIBON'S SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:11.011
WHEN KURIBON
IS ATTACKED,

00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.414
HE CAN RETURN
TO MY HAND IN ORDER
TO AVOID DAMAGE.

00:20:13.414 --> 00:20:15.382
YOU CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.718
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU
REGAIN LIFE POINTS,

00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:22.256
AT LEAST I WAS ABLE TO
KEEP MY KURIBON SAFE.

00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:24.258
I PROMISED TO
PROTECT HIM.

00:20:24.258 --> 00:20:26.360
I PROMISED TO PROTECT
THE ENTIRE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.095
AND I'M GOING TO
KEEP THAT PROMISE!

00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:29.763
HA HA HA!

00:20:29.763 --> 00:20:31.198
NOOO!

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:32.800
MY POWER WILL BREAK
YOU AND YOUR PROMISE!

00:20:50.305 --> 00:20:54.242
AH HA HA HA!
AH HA!

00:20:54.242 --> 00:20:57.646
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
DO TO SAVE THIS WORLD.

00:20:57.646 --> 00:21:01.883
I WILL DESTROY IT
AND REBUILD IT UNDER MY RULE!

00:21:01.883 --> 00:21:07.088
AH HA HA HA!
AH HA HA HA!

00:21:07.088 --> 00:21:08.556
FAIRY DRAGON...

00:21:08.556 --> 00:21:10.692
MAN, SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S REALLY MAD.

00:21:10.692 --> 00:21:13.595
OH NO...
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

00:21:13.595 --> 00:21:16.264
AH HA HA HA!
OH, HA HA!

00:21:16.264 --> 00:21:19.768
AAH HA HA HA!

00:21:19.768 --> 00:21:23.071
[GROWLS]

00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:25.040
SHE IS GOING TO
CRUSH HIM!

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.509
DON'T DO IT!
THEN YOU'RE NO
BETTER THAN HE IS!

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:29.144
PUT HIM DOWN, OKAY?!

00:21:29.144 --> 00:21:32.013
[ROARS]

00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:34.282
MAYBE IF I CAN JUST
END THIS DUEL!

00:21:34.282 --> 00:21:37.719
I ACTIVATE
OBERON'S PRANK!

00:21:37.719 --> 00:21:39.888
THIS SPELL REVERSES
FAIRY WIND'S EFFECT.

00:21:39.888 --> 00:21:41.623
INSTEAD OF RESTORING
OUR LIFE POINTS,

00:21:41.623 --> 00:21:45.060
IT DAMAGES US
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.695
[LAUGHING
MANIACALLY]

00:21:50.732 --> 00:21:52.834
AAH! AAH!

00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:54.669
AAH!

00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:58.306
THE EVIL IS GONE,
BUT YOU MUST NOW STOP

00:21:58.306 --> 00:22:00.208
THE PERSON WHO SEALED
ME AWAY.

00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:05.180
[GROANING]

00:22:09.617 --> 00:22:12.087
[MOANING]

00:22:12.087 --> 00:22:13.488
[THINKING]
IS HE OKAY?

00:22:13.488 --> 00:22:14.556
[GROANS]

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:18.159
HE IS. THAT'S GOOD...
I GUESS.

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:26.668
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:34.175
LEO!

00:22:34.175 --> 00:22:37.345
[YAWNING]

00:22:37.345 --> 00:22:39.114
LEO! YOU'RE OKAY!

00:22:39.114 --> 00:22:40.715
HUH? I'M "OKAY?"

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.150
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU JUST SORTA FAINTED
EARLIER, KID.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.253
REALLY? I DID?!

00:22:45.253 --> 00:22:46.955
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM.

00:22:46.955 --> 00:22:48.957
BUT I CAN'T
REMEMBER IT NOW.

00:22:48.957 --> 00:22:52.026
HA. YEAH, DREAMS
ARE LIKE THAT...

00:22:52.026 --> 00:22:53.995
SO, HEY, HOW'S LUNA?

00:22:53.995 --> 00:22:56.197
CHECK IT OUT.

00:22:56.197 --> 00:22:58.233
OUR LOSERS' BRACKET
BATTLE HAS ENDED...

00:22:58.233 --> 00:23:01.069
AND NEITHER COMPETITOR
WILL BE MOVING ON!

00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:02.937
BOTH DUELISTS
HAVE LOST.

00:23:02.937 --> 00:23:05.540
HUH?! AW.

00:23:09.144 --> 00:23:10.145
HMM?

00:23:17.085 --> 00:23:18.486
[CHIRPS]

00:23:18.486 --> 00:23:19.854
[THINKING]
DON'T WORRY, KURIBON.

00:23:19.854 --> 00:23:21.489
I WON'T LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:23.992
I'LL ALWAYS WATCH
OVER THE SPIRIT WORLD.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.030
I CAN WALK BY MYSELF,
YOU KNOW.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.834
WELCOME BACK.
[CHEERING]

00:23:40.108 --> 00:23:42.644
Jack: SO THAT GIRL
HAS A MARK.

00:23:42.644 --> 00:23:46.014
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

00:23:46.014 --> 00:23:49.851
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
