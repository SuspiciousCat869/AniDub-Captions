WEBVTT

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.371
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH 5Ds"!

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:05.472
KALIN'S FLAME HAS
BEEN EXTINGUISHED.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:08.475
HOW DISAPPOINTING.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.212
PROFESSOR FUDO, IT SEEMS
THE THISTLE DOESN'T FALL

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.647
FAR FROM THE BRUSH.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.083
DESTINY HAS MADE YOUR SON
A THORN IN MY SIDE.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.956
COMMANDER,
THIS IS FAR ENOUGH.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.026
I CAN TAKE
THINGS FROM HERE.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.729
I THOUGHT YOU'D
FORGOTTEN THE PROMISE
YOU MADE.

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.632
I DON'T FORGET PROMISES,
BIG BROTHER.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.433
I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED ME TO DO.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:34.701
I'VE STAYED IN CONTACT
WITH ILIASTER,

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:37.170
I'VE WATCHED THE STARS,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.205
I BROUGHT
THE SIGNERS TOGETHER.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.940
THE KING OF THE NETHERWORLD
WILL EMERGE,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.709
READY TO FIGHT,
BUT YOUR SIGNERS,

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.444
YUSEI IN PARTICULAR,

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.079
THEY'RE TRYING
TO CLOSE THE GATE.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.649
THEY'RE TRYING
TO STOP DESTINY.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.251
THE PUBLIC
SECURITY BUREAU?

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.794
TIME TO INVESTIGATE.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.162
HA HA HA!

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.163
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.699
I AM GONNA MAKE
YOU PAY FOR ALL

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.601
THE DAMAGE THAT
YOU'VE DONE!

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.770
THERE ARE INCREDIBLE
FORCES AT PLAY HERE, YUSEI,

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.638
WE HUMANS ARE JUST
THE MEANS TO AN END,

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.040
WE'RE NOT IMPORTANT.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.942
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS
FOR YOU...

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.677
THE CRAZY STOPS
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW!

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.946
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.984
I NOW SUMMON
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL URU!

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:26.720
WHOA.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.256
UNLEASH YOUR WEB
OF DESTRUCTION!

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.457
ATTACK!

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.594
I ACTIVATE MY
TRAP SPIRIT FORCE!

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.596
WITH THIS IN PLAY,
I CAN AVOID TAKING

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.798
ANY DAMAGE BY
DEFLECTING YOUR ATTACK,

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:39.466
AND AFTER THAT,
I CAN ADD

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.634
A REINFORCEMENT
TO MY HAND

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.135
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.071
ACTUALLY... YOU WON'T
BE DOING ANY

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.072
OF THOSE THINGS.
WHAT?

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:47.741
WITH THE POWER
OF EARTHBOUND WAVE,

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.776
I CAN NEGATE
THE ACTIVATION AND EFFECT

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.345
OF ONE
OF YOUR TRAP CARDS.

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.246
OH, NO! AAH!

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.086
FIGHT BACK SO THAT
I CAN THROW YOU

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:02.122
TO THE SHADOWS JUST
LIKE I DID YOUR FATHER.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.627

HUH?

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.674
THAT LOOKS LIKE...

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:29.710
Roman: YUSEI FUDO!

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.611
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:34.347
HA HA HA!

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.483
ARE YOU TOO
SCARED TO DRAW?

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.351
IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
IF YOU ARE,

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.487
AS I WOULD BE TOO,
IF HALF MY LIFE POINTS

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.190
DEPENDED ON WHAT KIND
OF CARD I PICKED.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.191
I'M NOT SCARED!

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.128
WELL YOU SHOULD BE
SINCE YOU JUST DREW

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:50.197
A MONSTER CARD.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.132
NOW BECAUSE OF THAT,
THE DESTINY ACTIVATOR SPELL

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:56.236
ACTIVATES AND ALL
BUT ENDS THIS DUEL!

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.774
HE'S BARELY HOLDING ON.

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.476
YUSEI!
YUSEI!

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:05.779
HA HA HA!

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.014
DESTINY HAS YOU
IN ITS GRASP.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.250
IT'S CRUSHING YOU.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.685
HE LOOKS WEAK.
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.287
GONNA GIVE UP, DO YOU?

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.556
THIS DUEL IS OVER.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:18.792
IT'S NOT OVER 'TIL
THE LAST CARD IS PLAYED.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:20.260
YOU TELL HIM!
DON'T BACK DOWN!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.428
GET 'IM, KID!

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.631
I SUMMON ZERO GARDNA
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.136
Computer: IF YOU CHOSE
TO SACRIFICE THE MONSTER CARD

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:32.005
ZERO GARDNA,
YOU WILL TAKE ZERO DAMAGE

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.141
FOR THE REST OF THIS TURN.

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.143
NEXT, I PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN

00:04:36.143 --> 00:04:37.444
AND END MY TURN.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.747
IMPRESSIVE. YOU HAVE
THE WILL TO FIGHT
ON AFTER ALL.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:45.452
I SUPPOSE YOU INHERITED
THAT STUBBORNNESS
FROM YOUR FATHER.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.088
HOW FASCINATING THAT
AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS,

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.790
THE SIGNER WHO'S COME
STUMBLING DOWN HERE,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.526
HOPING TO DEFEAT ME IS
PROFESSOR FUDO'S SON.

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.261
AND YOU THINK DESTINY'S
NOT IN CONTROL.

00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:58.098
THE ONLY DESTINY IS
THE ONE WE MAKE, ROMAN!

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:01.034
STRONG WORDS, YUSEI,
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.436
HANGING ON BY A THREAD,
BUT YOU'RE UP AGAINST

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:06.606
A FORCE WITH POWER
YOU CAN'T BEGIN
TO COMPREHEND.

00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.776
A FORCE AWOKEN
BY YOUR FATHER.

00:05:24.438 --> 00:05:26.139
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO LEARN THE TRUTH

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.276
ABOUT THE FORCE YOUR
FATHER'S WORK AWOKE.

00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:32.846
TWENTY YEARS AGO,
DURING AN EXPERIMENT,
YOUR FATHER,

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:34.848
ALREADY AN EXPERT
IN QUANTUM PHYSICS,

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:37.117
DISCOVERED
PLANETARY PARTICLES.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:38.452
"PLANETARY
PARTICLES?"

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:40.354
WHAT ARE THOSE?

00:05:40.354 --> 00:05:42.022
Roman: LET ME EXPLAIN THIS
SO YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:05:42.022 --> 00:05:45.258
THESE PARTICLES ACT
LIKE PLANETARY GEARS,

00:05:45.258 --> 00:05:48.829
BINDING OTHERWISE UNRELATED
PARTICLES TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:51.064
KIND OF LIKE HOW THE MARK
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:05:51.064 --> 00:05:53.333
HAS UNITED YOU
AND YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS,

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:58.171
A PLANETARY PARTICLE
BRINGS OTHER UNLIKE
PARTICLES TOGETHER.

00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:01.108
YOUR FATHER'S TEAM BEGAN
CONDUCTING EXPERIMENTS,

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:03.010
USING PLANETARY
PARTICLES TO BUILD

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.712
AND MANIPULATE GREATER
MOLECULAR STRUCTURES,

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:08.181
WHICH LED TO
THE DISCOVERY OF ENER-D,

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.518
AND THE CREATION
OF THE ENER-D REACTOR.

00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:14.054
REX AND I JOINED
HIS TEAM AS
RESEARCH ASSISTANTS.

00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:16.123
EVERYONE WAS EXCITED
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES

00:06:16.123 --> 00:06:17.591
THE REACTOR
WAS PRESENTING.

00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:18.825
ESPECIALLY YOUR FATHER.

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:21.728
HE COULDN'T CONTAIN
HIS ENTHUSIASM.

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:25.032
GENTLEMEN, IT'S WORKING,
AND THIS IS THE KEY.

00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:30.904
Roman, voice-over:
THE RESEARCH WAS
PROCEEDING SMOOTHLY.

00:06:30.904 --> 00:06:33.740
UNTIL THAT FATEFUL DAY.

00:06:33.774 --> 00:06:36.043
WE WERE WORKING LATE
INTO THE EVENING.

00:06:36.043 --> 00:06:37.044
[RUMBLING]

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:39.312
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD.

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:42.382
Goodwin: THOSE ENERGY
READINGS CAN'T BE
RIGHT, CAN THEY?

00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:46.053
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE EQUIPMENT,
EVERYTHING'S WORKING.

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:48.588
Roman, voice-over:
WE COULDN'T COMPREHEND
WHAT WE WERE WITNESSING.

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:50.557
THE ONLY THING WE WERE
CERTAIN OF WAS THAT

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.726
THE ENER-D REACTOR SEEMED
TO BE CREATING

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.229
A STRANGE AND MAGNIFICENT
POWER THAT SCIENCE
COULDN'T DEFINE.

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.865
EVERY TIME WE CONDUCTED
A TEST, UNUSUAL WEATHER

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:01.201
DESCENDED
ON NEW DOMINO CITY.

00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:02.202
ARE YOU SERIOUS,
PROFESSOR?!

00:07:02.202 --> 00:07:04.104
YOU'RE SHUTTING
THE REACTOR DOWN?

00:07:04.104 --> 00:07:05.105
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:07.007
WE CAN'T PINPOINT
THE CONNECTION

00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:10.177
BETWEEN THE REACTOR
AND THESE RECENT
UNUSUAL OCCURRENCES.

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:11.745
IT'S...
WELL, YES, BUT...
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:12.813
TO PRESS ON.

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:14.214
IT'S WHY WE
HAVE TO STOP.

00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:16.416
WE CAN'T RISK SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENING,

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:17.451
WE CAN'T KNOWINGLY
PUT THE CITY IN DANGER

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:20.153
IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS.

00:07:20.153 --> 00:07:22.355
Roman, voice-over:
I WASN'T HAPPY
TO SAY THE LEAST

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.858
SO I DID SOME INVESTIGATING,
AND DISCOVERED THAT

00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:26.159
THERE WAS ANOTHER PART
OF THE WORLD

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.160
WHERE SIMILAR
WEATHER CONDITIONS

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.396
AND SEISMIC ANOMALIES
WERE HAPPENING

00:07:29.396 --> 00:07:31.531
AT THE SAME TIME
AS OUR TESTS.

00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:32.966
SO I JOURNEYED TO
THE NAZCA LANDS

00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:36.970
TO FIND OUT AS MUCH
INFORMATION AS I COULD.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.243
WHILE TRAVELLING AROUND,
I HEARD A LOCAL LEGEND...

00:07:43.243 --> 00:07:46.446
ACCORDING TO THIS MYTH...
EVERY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS,

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:50.317
POWERFUL SPIRITS
RISE UP AND BATTLE
AT THE NAZCA LANDS.

00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:53.820
THE NAZCA LINES WERE SAID
TO BE THE EVIL SPIRITS
SEALED AWAY,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.390
DEFEATED BY
THE GREAT DRAGON
DURING THEIR LAST BATTLE.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.429
I WAS SO CURIOUS,
SO I DROVE OUT TO SEE
THESE LINES FOR MYSELF.

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:04.231
IT WAS THERE
I MET A MAN,

00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:06.366
A MAN FROM ILIASTER.

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:07.367
ILIASTER?

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:09.302
PROFESSOR GOODWIN,
RIGHT?

00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:11.104
SHAME ABOUT THE REACTOR.

00:08:11.104 --> 00:08:15.142
I CAN'T BELIEVE
PROFESSOR FUDO
JUST SHUT IT DOWN.

00:08:15.142 --> 00:08:17.911
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
ME AND THE REACTOR?

00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:19.012
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT,
CAN YOU?

00:08:19.012 --> 00:08:20.447
YOU WANT DESPERATELY
TO CONTINUE

00:08:20.447 --> 00:08:22.115
THE PARTICLE RESEARCH.

00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:23.917
AM I WRONG?

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:26.253
THE RESEARCH MUST
CONTINUE, EVEN IF THAT

00:08:26.253 --> 00:08:27.821
MEANS GETTING RID
OF PROFESSOR FUDO.

00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:30.857
YOU BETTER EXPLAIN
YOURSELF, AND QUICK!

00:08:30.857 --> 00:08:34.561
BEYOND THE REACTOR'S
LIGHT LIES
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:37.397
A POWER LIKE OUR WORLD
HAS NEVER KNOWN.

00:08:37.397 --> 00:08:39.833
YOU'VE FELT IT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

00:08:39.833 --> 00:08:41.568
WE AT ILIASTER BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE

00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:43.804
THE REAL VISIONARY, ROMAN,
THE ONE BRAVE ENOUGH

00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:46.273
TO TURN THE PRESENT
INTO THE FUTURE.

00:08:46.273 --> 00:08:48.408
YOU ARE SPECIAL,
ROMAN.

00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:49.876
DESTINY HAS HAND-PICKED YOU,

00:08:49.876 --> 00:08:52.245
YOU HAVE BEEN MARKED
FOR GREATNESS.

00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:53.914
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:08:53.914 --> 00:08:55.916
YOU HAVE A MARK ON YOUR
LEFT ARM, DO YOU NOT?

00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:02.823
I'VE HAD THIS MARK ON
MY ARM SINCE I WAS BORN.

00:09:02.823 --> 00:09:03.990
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.293
DESTINY HAS
CHOSEN YOU, ROMAN.

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:10.163
AND NO ONE CAN HIDE FROM
THEIR DESTINY FOREVER.

00:09:10.163 --> 00:09:13.767
[THINKING]
HUH? HE HAS THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON?

00:09:16.036 --> 00:09:19.372
IS HE
THE FIFTH SIGNER?

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:21.942
WAIT! THIS LEGEND I'VE
BEEN HEARING ABOUT,

00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:23.276
THIS EPIC BATTLE,
DOES IT HAVE

00:09:23.276 --> 00:09:25.979
SOMETHING
TO DO WITH ME?

00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:27.447
[GRUNTING]

00:09:27.447 --> 00:09:28.982
IT JUST MIGHT.

00:09:28.982 --> 00:09:32.319
ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH
TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE
IN THE LIGHT?

00:09:32.319 --> 00:09:34.588
IT WILL TELL YOU ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

00:09:34.588 --> 00:09:36.590
HEH HEH HEH!

00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:44.464
WAIT!
DON'T LEAVE!

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.803
WHAT'S HE MEAN,
"THE VOICE IN THE LIGHT?"

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:58.144
Roman, voice-over:
AND THEN I HEARD IT.

00:09:58.144 --> 00:10:00.547
IT WASN'T A VOICE LIKE
ME TALKING TO YOU,

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:02.415
IT WASN'T WORDS,

00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:04.184
BUT THE LIGHT
WAS SPEAKING TO ME
NONETHELESS.

00:10:04.184 --> 00:10:07.854
[GRUNTING]

00:10:07.854 --> 00:10:12.025
AND THEN I SAW IT ALL,
AND I UNDERSTOOD...

00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:14.995
THE ENER-D REACTOR WAS
DESTINY'S INSTRUMENT.

00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:16.029
IT HAD THE POWER
TO BREAK THE SEALS

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:19.165
OF THE NAZCA LINES,
TO RELEASE THE ARMY

00:10:19.165 --> 00:10:22.435
OF SHADOWS AND INSTIGATE
THE GREAT BATTLE.

00:10:27.173 --> 00:10:29.943
HUH?

00:10:29.943 --> 00:10:31.945
I WONDER WHAT'S INSIDE?

00:10:35.248 --> 00:10:37.117
WHOA! REX GOODWIN!

00:10:37.117 --> 00:10:38.852
WHAT'RE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

00:10:38.852 --> 00:10:40.153
CROW.

00:10:40.153 --> 00:10:41.354
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?!

00:10:41.354 --> 00:10:42.355
I CAME TO SAY GOODBYE
TO SOMEONE,

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:46.826
TO MY... MY BROTHER.

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:49.562
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG,
EVERYONE KNEW MY BIG
BROTHER WAS A GENIUS.

00:10:49.562 --> 00:10:54.000
I WAS ALWAYS VERY
PROUD OF HIM.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.568
BUT IN ADDITION
TO HIS GENIUS,

00:10:55.568 --> 00:10:58.505
MY BROTHER WAS BURDENED
WITH A GREAT DESTINY.

00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:00.340
THIS ISSUE IS NOT
UP FOR DEBATE.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.542
I AM SHUTTING
DOWN THE REACTOR.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:03.743
Man: SORRY, PROFESSOR.

00:11:03.777 --> 00:11:05.845
I'M AFRAID YOU NO LONGER
HAVE ANY AUTHORITY.

00:11:05.845 --> 00:11:08.315
AS OF THIS MORNING,
YOU'VE BEEN EXPELLED

00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:10.417
FROM THE R.R.D.

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:11.985
I'VE BEEN WHAT?!

00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:13.520
WE'VE POURED WAY
TOO MUCH MONEY

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.188
INTO THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THIS REACTOR.

00:11:15.188 --> 00:11:18.992
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
SIT BACK AND LET
YOU SHUT IT DOWN.

00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:20.994
ROMAN GOODWIN WILL
BE TAKING OVER.

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:23.296
ROMAN, WHAT... WHAT'S
THE MEANING OF THIS?

00:11:23.296 --> 00:11:25.365
THE R.R.D. NEEDS TO BE
LED BY SOMEONE

00:11:25.365 --> 00:11:27.867
WITH THE COURAGE
TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:30.337
THE BOARD NOW FEELS
THAT I AM THAT PERSON.

00:11:30.337 --> 00:11:31.338
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN
ACTION AND SHUT DOWN

00:11:31.338 --> 00:11:32.906
THE GENERATOR TOWERS.

00:11:32.906 --> 00:11:35.542
THE SEALS ARE ALREADY
IN PLACE, THEY...

00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:37.010
WHEN YOU SAY SEALS,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.847
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THESE?

00:11:40.847 --> 00:11:42.382
HOW DID YOU?

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.319
DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE!

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:54.361
TALK TO ME, SIR.

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.229
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

00:11:56.229 --> 00:12:00.033
REX, SHUT DOWN
THE REACTOR.

00:12:00.033 --> 00:12:03.436
TAKE THESE AND HIDE
THEM FROM YOUR BROTHER.

00:12:03.436 --> 00:12:06.373
THE SAFETY
OF THE WORLD DEPENDS ON IT.

00:12:24.205 --> 00:12:27.275
ROMAN!
WHERE ARE YOU?!

00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:34.015
THERE YOU ARE!

00:12:34.015 --> 00:12:36.984
REX, DID YOU HELP
PROFESSOR FUDO ESCAPE?

00:12:36.984 --> 00:12:38.186
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

00:12:38.186 --> 00:12:39.187
TAKE THIS!

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:41.189
TAKE THIS AND RUN!

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:43.524
HUH?

00:12:43.524 --> 00:12:45.526
WHAT IS
IN THIS CAPSULE?

00:12:45.526 --> 00:12:48.696
THE KEY TO
THE WORLD'S SURVIVAL.

00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:51.199
GOOD AND EVIL WERE
BATTLING WITHIN ME,
BROTHER,

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:53.601
AND I CHOSE
THE PATH OF DARKNESS.

00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:55.870
KEEP THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON SAFE.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.705
GATHER THE FOUR SIGNERS,
THEN COME BACK

00:12:57.705 --> 00:12:59.073
AND DEFEAT ME!

00:12:59.073 --> 00:13:00.174
BROTHER.

00:13:00.174 --> 00:13:03.277
GO!

00:13:03.277 --> 00:13:04.712
FIND THE SIGNERS!

00:13:04.712 --> 00:13:06.114
FIND THEM!

00:13:13.755 --> 00:13:18.426
AND WITH THIS, I WILL BE
REBORN AS A DARK SIGNER.

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.828
AAAAAAAARG!!!

00:13:26.033 --> 00:13:28.236
Computer: WARNING...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION.

00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:30.271
PLEASE FOLLOW
EVACUATION PROTOCOL.

00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:32.907
WARNING...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION...

00:13:32.907 --> 00:13:36.077
DON'T WORRY.

00:13:36.077 --> 00:13:38.980
YOU'LL BE SAFE,
MY SON.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.849
PLEASE FOLLOW
EVACUATION PROTOCOL.

00:13:41.849 --> 00:13:43.651
WARNING...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.501
Roman: IT WAS AT
THAT MOMENT THE DOOR
TO THE UNDERWORLD OPENED.

00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:03.771
AND I BECAME
A DARK SIGNER.

00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:05.973
SO YOUR BROTHER
STARTED HEARING VOICES

00:14:05.973 --> 00:14:08.776
AND THEN MADE
THE REACTOR SPIN
IN REVERSE?

00:14:08.776 --> 00:14:11.546
I GUESS WITH FORCES
LIKE THAT AT WORK,

00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:13.748
IT'S NO WONDER
THE LEGENDARY MAN
WHO TRIED TO BUILD

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:16.417
THE DAEDULUS BRIDGE
WASN'T SUCCESSFUL.

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:18.920
SO I TAKE IT YOU BELIEVE
THAT "LEGENDARY MAN"
REALLY EXISTED?

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.389
WELL, YEAH.

00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:23.858
I MEAN, THE GUY IS
KINDA SORTA, MY HERO.

00:14:23.858 --> 00:14:28.262
ONE DAY, I'M GONNA
RE-UNITE DOMINO CITY
AND SATELLITE.

00:14:28.262 --> 00:14:29.564
YES, OF COURSE, AND THEN
YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE

00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:34.168
SOCIETY AND STOP CRIME
AND CURE DISEASES.

00:14:34.168 --> 00:14:36.771
YOU KNOW I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO MAKE THAT
DREAM A REALITY.

00:14:36.771 --> 00:14:40.508
BUT FIRST I NEED YOU
TO PASS ALONG A MESSAGE
TO YUSEI FOR ME.

00:14:40.508 --> 00:14:41.876
IF HE DEFEATS
MY BROTHER,

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:42.877
TELL HIM
I'LL BE WAITING.

00:14:42.877 --> 00:14:45.279
HOLD UP!

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:48.683
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WAITING WHERE?

00:14:48.683 --> 00:14:50.885
YOU LIED TO ME,
ROMAN.

00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:52.787
YOU SAID THAT
MY FATHER WAS GREEDY

00:14:52.787 --> 00:14:54.522
AND THAT HE DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT
THE SAFEGUARDS.

00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:58.626
OH, YUSEI, I SAID WHAT
I SAID BECAUSE

00:14:58.626 --> 00:15:01.429
I WANTED TO UPSET YOU,
TO RATTLE YOU.

00:15:01.462 --> 00:15:04.165
IN TRUTH, YOUR FATHER
WAS A SELF-RIGHTEOUS BORE

00:15:04.165 --> 00:15:05.666
WHO COULDN'T
SEE THE MAGNIFICENCE

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:07.702
OF THE ENER-D REACTOR.

00:15:07.702 --> 00:15:09.070
IN THE END, HE WAS
BLINDED BY FEAR.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.440
JUST AS YOU WILL BE!

00:15:12.473 --> 00:15:16.444
THIS IS IT... THE MOMENT
DESTINY HAS BEEN
PUSHING ME TOWARDS!

00:15:16.444 --> 00:15:20.848
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL URU,
ATTACK YUSEI DIRECTLY!

00:15:21.515 --> 00:15:24.485
NOT SO FAST, ROMAN!

00:15:26.754 --> 00:15:28.189
BY RELEASING
ZERO GARDNA,

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:29.790
I CAN DEFLECT
YOUR ATTACK

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.559
AND AVOID TAKING
BATTLE DAMAGE.

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:33.861
SO YOU MANAGED TO
SURVIVE ANOTHER ATTACK.

00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:37.798
HOW MUCH LONGER DO
YOU THINK YOU CAN
KEEP THIS UP?

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:39.600
WELL IF ROMAN
KEEPS ATTACKING,

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.935
NOT VERY LONG.

00:15:40.935 --> 00:15:42.136
TRY TO STAY POSITIVE.

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:44.038
I DRAW!

00:15:44.038 --> 00:15:46.674
AND PLAY
TWO FACEDOWNS.

00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:48.509
[THINKING]
I JUST HOPE ONE
OF THEM CAN SAVE ME.

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:51.712
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
YOUR MOVE, ROMAN.

00:15:51.712 --> 00:15:54.849
HE'S BETTING EVERYTHING
ON SOME TRAP CARDS?

00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:56.050
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK
AGAINST THE WALL!

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.885
I'M CLOSING IN!

00:15:57.885 --> 00:15:59.787
HEH HEH HEH!

00:15:59.787 --> 00:16:03.658
AND THIS TRAP WILL CRUSH
WHAT LITTLE HOPE YOU HAD.

00:16:03.658 --> 00:16:05.860
GO, EARTHBOUND WHIRLWIND!

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.096
WITH URU ON MY FIELD,
I CAN USE EARTHBOUND
WHIRLWIND

00:16:09.096 --> 00:16:12.133
TO DESTROY EVERY SPELL
AND TRAP CARD ON YOUR FIELD.

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:13.200
I KNEW IT.
BY PLAYING THOSE FACEDOWNS,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.937
HE'S LEFT HIMSELF
WIDE OPEN.

00:16:15.937 --> 00:16:17.772
I HOPED YOU'D
TRY THIS!

00:16:17.772 --> 00:16:20.441
I ACTIVATE
STARLIGHT ROAD!

00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:23.044
SINCE TWO OF MY CARDS
ARE ABOUT TO BE
DESTROYED,

00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:26.881
MY TRAP CAN DEFLECT
THE SPELL!

00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:29.050
AND NOW I CAN USE
MY STARDUST ROAD

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.018
TO PAVE THE WAY
FOR A SUMMONING!

00:16:31.018 --> 00:16:34.655
I GIVE YOU...
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.227
[ROARS]

00:16:40.227 --> 00:16:41.696
HE DID IT!

00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.497
AND YOU GUYS WERE BEING
ALL NEGATIVE AND STUFF,

00:16:43.497 --> 00:16:45.499
BUT I KNEW HE
COULD DO IT!

00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:49.437
SO YOU MANAGED TO
SUMMON YOUR LIZARD.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.038
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.

00:16:51.038 --> 00:16:52.139
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:53.140
HUH?

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.443
I TRIGGER
THE SHOOTING STAR TRAP!

00:16:55.476 --> 00:16:57.545
WITH STARDUST DRAGON
ON THE FIELD,

00:16:57.545 --> 00:16:59.280
SHOOTING STAR
CAN DESTROY ONE
OF YOUR CARDS.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.649
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU
CAN DO WITHOUT

00:17:01.649 --> 00:17:04.151
YOUR SPIDER WEB FIELD
SPELL IN PLAY!

00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:05.553
ACTUALLY, LET'S NOT!

00:17:05.553 --> 00:17:07.822
I ACTIVATE
ANTI EMPTINESS!

00:17:07.822 --> 00:17:10.157
WITH THIS CARD IN PLAY
IF I DROP ONE OF MY

00:17:10.157 --> 00:17:12.960
MONSTERS' ATTACK POINTS
TO ZERO I CAN STOP

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.996
THE EFFECT OF YOUR TRAP.

00:17:17.164 --> 00:17:20.401
AND WITH THAT,
I END MY TURN.

00:17:20.401 --> 00:17:22.436
BUT NOT BEFORE MY
EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL GETS

00:17:22.436 --> 00:17:23.971
ALL OF ITS ATTACK
POINTS BACK!

00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:26.640
NOT BAD, ROMAN,
BUT LET'S SEE IF YOU

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.076
CAN COUNTER MY BATTLE
WALTZ SPELL CARD!

00:17:29.076 --> 00:17:31.946
CAUSE WITH THIS IN PLAY,
I GET A WALTZ TOKEN

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:33.981
WHICH CAN
DUPLICATE MY DRAGON!

00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:35.583
YOU DO KNOW THAT
YOU CAN'T ATTACK

00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:37.485
AN EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL,
DON'T YOU?

00:17:37.485 --> 00:17:39.053
THANKS, BUT I WASN'T
PLANNING ON IT.

00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:40.054
I'M ATTACKING YOU!

00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:43.124
GO, COSMIC FLARE!

00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:46.627
DID YOU FORGET THAT
I HAVE A TRAP CARD?

00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:49.063
I PLAY ROAR
OF THE EARTHBOUND!

00:17:49.063 --> 00:17:51.766
AND SINCE YOUR DRAGON'S
WEAKER THAN MY URU,

00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:53.934
NOT ONLY DOES YOUR BEAST
GET DESTROYED

00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:56.937
BUT YOUR LIFE POINTS GET
OBLITERATED AS WELL!

00:17:58.039 --> 00:17:59.974
THIS DUEL IS OVER!

00:17:59.974 --> 00:18:02.910
NOTHING IS OVER
UNTIL I SAY IT IS!

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.779
I RELEASE MY STARDUST
DRAGON IN ORDER KEEP

00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:08.649
MY LIFE POINTS SAFE FROM
THE EFFECT OF YOUR TRAP!

00:18:08.649 --> 00:18:10.985
NOW ITS TIME FOR DRAGON
NUMBER TWO TO ATTACK!

00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:13.120
THIS IS GONNA
WIN IT!

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.522
NOT JUST YET!

00:18:14.522 --> 00:18:16.957
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
BRILLIANT SHRINE ART!

00:18:16.957 --> 00:18:18.192
NOW MY IMMORTAL CAN
INTERCEPT YOUR ATTACK

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:21.962
AND DESTROY YOUR
DUPLICATE DRAGON!

00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:36.903
MY EARTHBOUND IMMORTAL'S
GOING TO DESTROY YOUR

00:18:36.903 --> 00:18:38.638
DRAGON AND THEN YOU!

00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:43.443
THIS IS DESTINY'S HOUR,
YUSEI, BUT DON'T BE
TOO DISCOURAGED.

00:18:43.443 --> 00:18:45.445
YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO,

00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:48.281
YOU'VE PLAYED A VERY
PIVOTAL ROLE IN THIS
INCREDIBLE STORY.

00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:57.557
HUH?

00:18:57.557 --> 00:18:58.558
I KNOW YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS OVER

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:00.526
AND THAT YOUR
BIG MOMENT WAS COMING,

00:19:00.526 --> 00:19:02.595
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
I DON'T TAKE DAMAGE

00:19:02.595 --> 00:19:04.897
WHEN MY DUPLICATE DRAGON
IS DESTROYED.

00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:05.898
WHAT?!

00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:07.400
AND NOT ONLY THAT ROMAN,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.068
BUT YOUR EARTHBOUND
IMMORTAL'S POWER

00:19:09.102 --> 00:19:12.271
IS ABOUT TO TAKE A HIT
BECAUSE OF MY TOKEN'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:18.811
ROMAN, I'VE
LISTENED TO YOU GO
ON LONG ENOUGH.

00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:23.516
YOU DO TERRIBLE THINGS,
THEN YOU SAY IT'S ALL
JUST DESTINY'S WILL.

00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:26.586
WELL, I'VE GOT SOME
VERY BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, ROMAN...

00:19:26.586 --> 00:19:28.688
THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS DESTINY,

00:19:28.688 --> 00:19:31.824
THERE'S ONLY WHAT YOU DO
AND WHAT YOU DON'T DO.

00:19:31.824 --> 00:19:33.126
BUT LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT LIFE IS

00:19:33.126 --> 00:19:36.229
A LONG SERIES
OF CHAIN REACTIONS.

00:19:36.229 --> 00:19:37.897
IF MY FATHER HAD
NEVER DISCOVERED

00:19:37.897 --> 00:19:40.600
THOSE PLANETARY
PARTICLE THINGS,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.070
THEN ZERO REVERSE NEVER
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

00:19:44.103 --> 00:19:46.873
SATELLITE WOULD STILL
BE PART OF DOMINO CITY.

00:19:46.873 --> 00:19:48.074
MY FRIENDS LIKE CROW
AND JACK WOULDN'T HAVE

00:19:48.107 --> 00:19:51.444
HAD TO GROW UP ALONE
ON THE STREETS.

00:19:51.444 --> 00:19:52.779
BUT MY DAD WAS MY DAD,

00:19:52.779 --> 00:19:54.313
HE WASN'T SOME
COSMIC CHESS PIECE.

00:19:54.313 --> 00:19:57.350
AND AS FOR MY FRIENDS
AND ALL THE BAD STUFF

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.785
THEY'VE HAD TO GO
THROUGH,

00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:00.286
DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S FATE!

00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:01.754
DON'T TELL ME
EVERYTHING HAPPENED

00:20:01.754 --> 00:20:04.157
'CAUSE IT WAS MEANT TO!

00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:05.858
YUSEI.

00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:07.260
THAT'S A LIE!

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.528
IT HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF YOU

00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:10.429
AND CHOICES
YOU MADE!

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:13.566
IF ONLY YOU COULD KNEW
HOW WRONG YOU ARE.

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:16.335
Crow: DON'T LISTEN TO
THAT WINGNUT, YUSEI!

00:20:18.171 --> 00:20:20.173
CROW.

00:20:20.173 --> 00:20:21.741
HE'S KIDDING
HIMSELF.

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:24.443
YA' THINK SO?
I KNOW SO.

00:20:24.443 --> 00:20:26.746
I HEARD WHAT YOU
JUST SAID ABOUT
YOUR DAD, MAN,

00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:30.183
AND YOU'RE RIGHT...
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:32.451
THERE'S NO WAY
HE COULDA KNOWN

00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:34.420
ROMAN WAS GONNA
DO WHAT HE DID.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.421
I GUESS SO.

00:20:35.421 --> 00:20:36.589
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY...

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:38.357
IF ZERO REVERSE
HAD NEVER HAPPENED,

00:20:38.357 --> 00:20:39.559
YOU AND ME
AND ALL THE OTHERS

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.894
MIGHT NOT'VE MET UP
AND BECOME BEST FRIENDS.

00:20:41.894 --> 00:20:43.563
GOOD THINGS LEAD
TO BAD THINGS

00:20:43.563 --> 00:20:45.531
LEADING TO MORE
GOOD THINGS,

00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:46.766
AND THAT'S JUST LIFE!

00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:48.367
AND AT THE END
OF THE DAY...

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:49.869
WE ALL HAVE CHOICES.

00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:51.237
WE AREN'T "DESTINED"
TO MAKE THEM.

00:20:51.237 --> 00:20:52.805
THIS GUY'S JUST
USING DESTINY AS

00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:54.407
AN EXCUSE TO BE A JERK.

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:57.210
OR WHO KNOWS... MAYBE
IT WAS MY DESTINY
TO SAY THAT.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.646
BUT EITHER WAY...
FINISH THIS GUY,
WOULD YA?!

00:21:00.646 --> 00:21:02.448
I'M ON IT.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.619
YA KNOW WHAT...
ALL THAT REALLY MATTERS

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:08.654
IS THAT WE LISTEN
TO OURSELVES.

00:21:08.654 --> 00:21:11.524
AND THAT WE DO WHAT
WE THINK IS RIGHT.

00:21:11.524 --> 00:21:13.192
MAYBE THERE IS DESTINY.

00:21:13.192 --> 00:21:14.527
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN YOU WERE

00:21:14.527 --> 00:21:16.362
DESTINED TO FAIL.

00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:17.563
I REVEAL MY LAST
TRAP CARD...

00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:21.167
STARDUST FLASH!

00:21:21.167 --> 00:21:23.603
IF I WILLINGLY RELEASE
STARDUST DRAGON,

00:21:23.603 --> 00:21:24.637
I CAN USE THIS TRAP CARD
TO SUMMON IT BACK

00:21:24.637 --> 00:21:27.573
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:21:31.077 --> 00:21:33.412
YOU CAN BRING THAT
BEAST BACK AGAIN?

00:21:33.412 --> 00:21:36.249
THAT'S RIGHT ROMAN,
AND NOW HE'S GOING TO

00:21:36.249 --> 00:21:38.584
ATTACK WITH
COSMIC FLARE!

00:21:49.161 --> 00:21:51.130
HA HA HA!
HUH?

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.766
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S OVER, DON'T YOU?

00:21:53.766 --> 00:21:57.270
WELL UNLESS YOU SEAL ALL
THE TOWERS BY SUNSET,

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.905
THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD

00:21:58.905 --> 00:22:00.840
WILL RESURRECT!

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.475
UNH! AAH!

00:22:02.475 --> 00:22:04.410
GRAB THE WIRE!

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.478
YUSEI!

00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:07.346
AAH!

00:22:13.719 --> 00:22:15.254
HOME SWEET HOME.

00:22:21.794 --> 00:22:27.667
I SENSE THAT YUSEI HAS
WON HIS SHADOW DUEL.

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:30.036
TOO BAD, DEAR BROTHER,
BUT THEN YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID

00:22:30.036 --> 00:22:32.204
THAT YOUR LIFE
WAS INSIGNIFICANT,

00:22:32.204 --> 00:22:35.274
THAT THERE WERE
GREATER FORCES AT PLAY,

00:22:35.274 --> 00:22:37.677
AND MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT,
MAYBE WE'RE ALL

00:22:37.677 --> 00:22:42.815
JUST PAWNS IN DESTINY'S GAME,
BUT IF THAT IS THE CASE,

00:22:42.815 --> 00:22:44.483
THEN I SAY IT'S TIME
TO CHANGE THE RULES.
