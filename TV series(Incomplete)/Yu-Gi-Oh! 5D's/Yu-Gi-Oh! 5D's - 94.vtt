00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:39.052
SOMEONE WHO HAD
A VERY RARE CARD

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:41.154
WITH THE POWER
TO DELIVER REAL DAMAGE

00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:43.423
AND SEND PEOPLE
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:45.358
I WAS HOPIN' THAT
MAYBE YOU WOULD KNOW
SOMETHIN'

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.527
ABOUT THAT CARD.
HERE.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.295
AH!

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.698
YOU KNOW SOMETHIN'.
TELL ME!

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.701
WHO WAS IT THAT USED
THIS CARD ON PEARSON?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.037
BOLTON!

00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:00.073
JUST LET IT GO, CROW.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.274
HUH?

00:09:01.274 --> 00:09:04.110
SOME THINGS ARE BETTER
LEFT AS THEY ARE.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.013
BESIDES, NOTHING
WE DO NOW CAN CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:09.049
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE--

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.216
FOR THE BETTER.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.885
SO WHY NOT COME WORK
FOR ME IN MY FACTORY?

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.255
BOLTON,
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:16.756
HUH?

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.192
I JUST TOLD YOU WE MAY HAVE A
LEAD IN PEARSON'S DISAPPEARANCE

00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:21.728
AND YOU OFFER ME A JOB?!

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:23.263
I SEE HOW IT IS.

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.231
NOW THAT YOU'RE
SOME BIG SHOT CEO,

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.033
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.468
YOU'VE CHANGED, BOLTON.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:31.805
IT WAS STUPID OF ME TO EVEN
BOTHER COMIN' HERE TO SEE YA.

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.840
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.410
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:44.884
MY TIME IS VALUABLE,
BUT I DO HAVE INFORMATION.

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:47.887
SO IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU'LL HAVE TO DUEL ME
FOR IT!

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.122
DUEL YOU?

00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:50.423
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.592
IF YOU BEAT ME,
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.794
HOWEVER, IF I WIN...

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.832
YOU HAVE TO HAND OVER
THE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
TO ME.

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:01.101
WHADAYA MEAN
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON?

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.369
WAIT, DIDN'T PEARSON
HAVE A CARD NAMED THAT?

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:06.372
I SYNCHRO SUMMON...
MY ULTIMATE BEAST!

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:08.374
[ROAR]

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:11.911
YEAH, HE DID, BUT IT VANISHED
THAT NIGHT ALONG WITH PEARSON.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:13.680
THERE'S NO NEED
TO LIE, CROW.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.182
BEFORE PEARSON VANISHED,
I KNOW THAT HE ENTRUSTED YOU

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:19.819
WITH HIS DUEL RUNNER
AS WELL AS HIS PRIZED
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON.

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:23.423
YEAH, HE WANTED ME TO WATCH
AFTER HIS DUEL RUNNER,
BUT THAT WAS IT.

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.859
LOOK, CROW,
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:29.262
MY COMPANY IS
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:32.432
I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE
THE CASH I NEED TO
COVER MY PAYROLL.

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:35.435
SO I NEED SOMETHING
VALUABLE TO GIVE
TO THE BANK

00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:37.237
AS COLLATERAL
FOR A LOAN.

00:10:37.237 --> 00:10:38.505
COLLATERAL?

00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:40.907
YES, YES, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY...

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:42.942
THAT PEARSON WOULD
HATE THE IDEA

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.545
OF USING HIS BELOVED CARD
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.046
AND YOU'RE RIGHT...

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.415
BUT MY BACK IS UP AGAINST
THE WALL, OLD FRIEND.

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.217
AND IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING,

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:53.319
MANY OF MY EMPLOYEES
WILL HAVE TO BE LET GO.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.822
YA MEAN LOSE THEIR JOBS?

00:10:55.822 --> 00:10:57.757
THAT'S RIGHT, CROW.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.826
AND IF THEY LOSE
THEIR JOBS,

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.161
THEIR FAMILIES GO HUNGRY,

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.229
AND YOU KNOW HOW PEARSON
WOULD FEEL ABOUT THAT.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.230
AH.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.632
SO WHADAYA SAY,
CROW?

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:06.933
WILL YOU AGREE
TO DUEL ME?

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.636
I EVEN HAVE
THE PERFECT FIELD
FOR US TO COMPETE ON--

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.471
OUR DUEL RUNNER
TEST COURSE.

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:16.910
WELL?! WHAT'S
IT'S GONNA BE?!

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.993
Child: I SEE YOU...

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:35.061
HEY, COME ON!

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:36.196
YOUR TURN!
TAG! YOU'RE IT!

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.031
HUH?

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.400
CROW...?
YOU'VE BEEN STARING
AT THIS ALL DAY.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.434
WHAT IS IT?

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:44.103
A CARD.
AND ONE I NEED TO FIND

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:47.674
IF I'M EVER GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED TO PEARSON.

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:51.678
AND I NEED TO FIND OUT
'CAUSE HE WAS A GOOD
FRIEND TO ME...

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:54.914
AND WHEN I NEEDED
A FRIEND MOST.

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.482
SEE, A COUPLE YEARS AGO

00:11:56.482 --> 00:12:00.053
I WAS JUST SCRAPIN' BY
WITH SOME OTHER
HARD LUCK CASES...

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.089
Child: TRY THAT!

00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.390
HUH?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.658
UH!

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:07.794
DADDY?

00:12:07.794 --> 00:12:10.296
DADDY!

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:11.864
Crow: I DIDN'T KNOW
THE GUY WELL.

00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:14.467
ONLY THAT HE WORKED DAY AND
NIGHT TO SUPPORT HIS KIDS...

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.502
HERE'S HIS PAY.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:19.405
'COURSE, SINCE HE PASSED
OUT FROM EXHAUSTION
ON THE FACTORY FLOOR,

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.641
WE HAD TO DEDUCT
OUR TRAVEL EXPENSES!

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.644
HA HA!
YOU PUNKS! UH!

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:28.481
MIND YOUR MANNERS,

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.651
YOU WORTHLESS PIECE
OF SATELLITE SLIME!
LET'S ROLL.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:33.152
YEAH...

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:42.161
CHECK IT OUT...!

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:47.533
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WANTS
TO FIGHT! FINE BY ME.

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.135
LET'S SEE WHATCHA GOT!

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:52.472
TIME FOR A--
DIRECT ATTACK!

00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:54.741
GO WHITE WARRIOR--
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER!

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.777
I PLAY THE TRAP...
SHADOW DANCE!

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:01.314
IT WAS PEARSON.
AND BOLTON WAS THERE WITH HIM.

00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:04.050
THEY AND THEIR MONSTERS
SAVED THE DAY.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:08.788
WHOA...
THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME!

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.957
AND LAST I'LL SUMMON...

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.660
THE SYNCHRO MONSTER,
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON!

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.028
[ROAR]

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:17.730
HUH?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.733
AAH!
AAH!

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.636
RUN FOR IT!
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.876
THAT IS HOW I MET
ROBERT PEARSON.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:32.178
AND FROM THEN ON,
HE WAS ALWAYS AROUND,

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.447
HELPING TEACH THE KIDS
HOW TO GET BY,

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.816
MAKING SURE THEY ALWAYS HAD
A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.351
AND FOOD TO EAT...

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:41.321
TEACHING THEM NEW SKILLS
SO THEY WOULD KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A LIVING.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.457
I LIKED WHAT I SAW.
SO I DECIDED TO
JOIN UP WITH HIM,

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:45.958
HELP HIM ANY WAY
I COULD...

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.728
AND IT WASN'T LONG
UNTIL WE HATCHED A PLAN

00:13:48.728 --> 00:13:50.897
TO OPEN UP
OUR OWN DUEL RUNNER SHOP...

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:53.132
A PLACE WHERE OUR FRIENDS
COULD EARN A GOOD WAGE

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.468
AND WE COULD EARN
A REPUTATION...

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:57.470
FOR MAKIN' THE BEST
DUEL RUNNERS AROUND!

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.040
BUT IT WASN'T TO BE.

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:03.976
AFTER PEARSON VANISHED

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:07.447
I TRIED MY BEST TO TAKE CARE OF
THOSE KIDS LIKE HE WANTED.

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:11.984
EVEN IF I HAD TO BEG,
BORROW...OR STEAL.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.588
MAYBE BOLTON IS RIGHT.

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:18.057
I SHOULD JUST
FORGET THE PAST.

00:14:18.057 --> 00:14:22.095
AFTER ALL, EVERYTHING
ELSE HE'S SAID AND DONE
HAS BEEN RIGHT.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.896
THINK ABOUT IT.

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.199
HE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH
WITH PEARSON'S PLAN

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.801
AND NOW MAKES DUEL RUNNERS
FOR A LIVING.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:33.272
HE'S KEPT PEARSON'S DREAMS ALIVE
BETTER THAN I HAVE.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.074
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:37.710
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--
YOU'VE TAKEN CARE OF THE KIDS.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.746
HUH? I HAVE?

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:42.281
Spike: CROW!

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.983
WHATCHYA DOIN'
OVER THERE?

00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:46.452
COME ON OVER
AND PLAY WITH US!

00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:48.121
YEAH. YOU'RE FUN!

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.690
SURE, CROW, IT MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN EASY...

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.493
BUT JUST CHECK OUT THE SMILES
ON THEIR FACES.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.895
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB
TAKING CARE OF THOSE KIDS.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.297
JUST LIKE PEARSON
ASKED YOU TO.

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.733
SO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK
THAT BOLTON'S ANY MORE RIGHT

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.502
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAN YOU ARE.

00:15:02.502 --> 00:15:05.938
MAYBE SO...

00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:08.374
Jack: WHAT?
CROW'S DUELING BOLTON?!

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.143
MM-HMM.

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:11.978
BUT CROW DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE THIS SO-CALLED

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:13.746
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON CARD

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.048
THAT BOLTON WANTS TO DUEL
FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE!

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.384
I KNOW, BUT A DUEL'S
THE ONLY WAY

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.620
THAT CROW CAN GET BOLTON
TO SPILL WHAT HE KNOWS.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.523
AH...

00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:24.690
WELL...

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.659
GUESS WE HAVE A DUEL
COMING UP!

00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:43.709
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO AGREE?

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:46.112
LET'S JUST SAY
I HAD TO MAKE SURE

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:48.080
THAT WHAT I WAS DOING
WAS RIGHT.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.651
YOU BETTER BE SURE
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO GOING BACK NOW!

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:58.424
SETTING THE SPEED
WORLD 2 FIELD SPELL!

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.562
Both: DUEL!!!

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:05.498
[THINKING]
AND THE RACE FOR
THE TRUTH BEGINS!

00:16:21.013 --> 00:16:22.181
AH!

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:27.019
THAT IS
SOME SERIOUS SPEED.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.189
BOLTON'S NOT THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S PACKIN'
SOME RPM'S!

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:43.536
AH.

00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:45.538
SINCE YOU'RE LAGGING,
I THINK I'LL DRAW FIRST!

00:16:45.538 --> 00:16:48.808
HERE GOES! FIRST
I SUMMON WHITE WARRIOR--

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:52.144
FOG THE TREASURE SHIELD
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:55.314
I'LL THEN PLACE TWO FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN.

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:57.517
2,000 DEFENSE POINTS?

00:16:57.517 --> 00:17:00.052
ALRIGHT, THEN!

00:17:00.052 --> 00:17:02.955
SINCE THE ONLY MONSTER
OUT RIGHT NOW IS
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:05.958
I CAN SUMMON THIS CARD
WITHOUT HAVIN' TO
RELEASE A MONSTER!

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.529
SHOW YOURSELF,
BLACKWING--
SIROCCO THE DAWN!

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:14.433
NOW...SINCE A BLACKWING
IS OUT ON MY FIELD,

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:15.902
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON
THIS GUY!

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.437
BLACKWING--
BORA THE SPEAR...!

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:21.807
COME ON OUT AND
STRETCH THOSE WINGS,
MY FEATHERED FRIEND!

00:17:23.576 --> 00:17:26.379
AND THANKS TO THE
SPECIAL ABILITY OF
SIROCCO THE DAWN,

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:30.049
I CAN NOW CHANNEL HIS POWER
ONTO BORA THE SPEAR!

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:35.588
NOW BORA'S STRONG ENOUGH TO
TAKE DOWN HIS WHITE WARRIOR!

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:38.057
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
CROW...

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.560
I ACTIVATE MY FACEDOWN,
THE TRAP WHITEOUT!

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:46.832
NOW, WHATEVER SPECIAL
ABILITIES YOUR MONSTERS
ARE USING

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:49.569
ON ANY OF YOUR CARDS
ARE CANCELLED OUT!

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.836
AH!

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:54.240
YOU SEE, CROW, I KNOW
THE POWER OF THE BLACKWINGS

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.542
LAYS IN THEIR ABILITY
TO BOND WITH EACH OTHER

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.377
AND CREATE
AN EVEN GREATER FORCE...

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.812
SO YOU GIVE ME NO CHOICE--

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.080
IN ORDER TO WIN THIS...

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.183
I MUST SMASH THAT BOND
INTO OBLIVION!

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.518
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE DONE

00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:07.887
BECAUSE AS LONG AS WHITEOUT
IS ON THE FIELD,

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.590
YOUR BLACKWINGS WON'T BE
ABLE TO POWER UP ONE ANOTHER

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.725
BY EVEN A FRACTION
OF A POINT!

00:18:14.327 --> 00:18:16.729
THAT'LL CHANGE
CROW'S WHOLE
GAME PLAN!

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:18.965
I END MY TURN!

00:18:18.965 --> 00:18:23.502
THEN I'M UP!
AND I SUMMON WHITE WARRIOR--

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.838
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER!

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.574
Duel Runner Computer:
WHEN WHITE WARRIOR--
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:31.077
DESTROYS AN OPPONENT'S MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:33.879
YOU CAN DESTROY ANOTHER MONSTER
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.515
NOW I'LL ACTIVATE
THE TRAP SACRED ARROW!

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:38.484
AT THIS TURN'S END PHASE,

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:41.253
WE BOTH TAKE
400 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:45.124
FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR MONSTERS
THAT WAS DESTROYED
DURING THE ROUND.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:46.759
WHAT? 400 POINTS?

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.195
THIS IS NOT GOING TO
TURN OUT GOOD FOR ME...

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:50.863
OR FOR BORA THE SPEAR.

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:54.533
WHITE WARRIOR--
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER ATTACK!

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.870
UH!

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.707
AND NOW THAT MY IRON HAMMER
HAMMERED ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS INTO OBLIVION,

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:05.778
IT CAN SWING AWAY AT ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR FEATHERED FRIENDS.

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.413
AH!

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:09.548
AND NOW, SINCE WE'VE REACHED
THIS TURN'S END PHASE,

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:13.052
IT'S TIME FOR
SACRED ARROW TO STRIKE!

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:18.691
AH!

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:19.692
OH, NO!

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.360
[THINKING]
NOT GOOD.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.762
IT'S STARTING TO
LOOK LIKE BOLTON

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:24.363
HASN'T JUST SMASHED
THE BOND

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:25.931
OF THE BLACKWINGS
INTO OBLIVION--

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:28.701
BUT ANY CHANCE CROW
HAS TO WIN, AS WELL!

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.941
YOUR MOVE! AND I WOULD
MAKE IT COUNT IF I WERE YOU.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:40.212
THAT IS, IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO PEARSON!

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.915
HA HA!
