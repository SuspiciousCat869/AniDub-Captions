00:09:03.298 --> 00:09:06.168
IT'S MY TURN.
I DRAW!

00:09:06.168 --> 00:09:08.437
SWEET!

00:09:08.437 --> 00:09:10.606
I RELEASE JIRAI GUMO

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:14.143
IN ORDER TO SUMMON
USHI ONI!

00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:16.478
NOW WHY WOULD
HE DO THAT?

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:19.414
JIRAI GUMO IS
MORE POWERFUL THAN
THIS MONSTER.

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:21.016
JUST WAIT, OLD TIMER.

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.718
THE REAL SHOW'S
ABOUT TO BEGIN!

00:09:22.718 --> 00:09:25.387
NOW, I RELEASE
USHI ONI TO SUMMON

00:09:25.387 --> 00:09:27.322
GIANT USHI ONI!

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:33.028
AND NEXT MY GIANT
USHI ONI'S TAKING OUT

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:35.531
YOUR CRYSTAL SKULL!

00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:36.899
YEAH, CRACK UP
THAT CRYSTAL!

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:37.900
OH YEAH!!

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.169
[WHIMPERS]

00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:41.703
GO SPECTRE'S BITE!

00:09:44.273 --> 00:09:45.274
AAH!

00:09:48.477 --> 00:09:49.912
THAT WAS ONLY
THE BEGINNING

00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:51.213
OF YOUR WORRIES.

00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:53.682
'CAUSE WHEN GIANT USHI ONI
DESTROYS A MONSTER

00:09:53.682 --> 00:09:56.218
IN BATTLE,
IT GETS TO ATTACK AGAIN!

00:09:56.218 --> 00:09:58.754
AND WITH CRYSTAL SKULL
GONE, YOU'VE GOT

00:09:58.754 --> 00:10:02.457
NO DEFENSE, SO YOU'RE OPEN
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:10:02.457 --> 00:10:03.926
YOU'RE REALLY GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN THIS DUEL,

00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:05.227
AREN'T YA?!

00:10:05.227 --> 00:10:06.261
YOU OKAY?

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:07.763
THAT WAS AWESOME.

00:10:07.763 --> 00:10:09.898
THIS GUY JUST AIN'T
GOT WHAT IT TAKES.

00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:12.768
SO ARE YOU ANY
GOOD AT ALL, KID?

00:10:12.768 --> 00:10:15.504
OR ARE YOU THE LOSER
THESE GUYS SAY YOU ARE?!

00:10:32.592 --> 00:10:33.927
Goodwin: JACK, ALLOW ME
TO SHED SOME LIGHT.

00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:36.930
I AM THE 360th
GUARDIAN OF THE STAR.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.299
THROUGHOUT HISTORY,
MY ORDER HAS BEEN KNOWN
BY MANY NAMES...

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.502
THE DEFENDERS OF PEACE,
THE SERVANTS TO THE STARS.

00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:44.237
WE HAVE SWORN
TO MAINTAIN BALANCE

00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:48.008
IN THE UNIVERSE BY TAKING
THE OATH OF ILIASTER.

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.377
THE WHAT NOW?

00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:52.112
IT IS THE POWER
THAT GIVES EVERYTHING

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:53.680
IN NATURE ITS
INNER ESSENCE

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.449
AND OUTWARD FORM...

00:10:55.449 --> 00:10:58.251
THE UNIVERSE, ENERGY,
MANKIND.

00:10:58.251 --> 00:10:59.920
ILIASTER IS
THE POWER FLOWING

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.155
THROUGH ALL OF THESE THINGS,
BINDING THEM TOGETHER.

00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:03.457
SO IT'S GLUE.

00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:05.992
YOU'VE SWORN ALLEGIANCE
TO MAGIC GLUE.

00:11:05.992 --> 00:11:08.328
JOKE ALL YOU WANT,
BUT THAT MARK ON YOUR ARM?

00:11:08.328 --> 00:11:10.931
IT MEANS YOU'RE PART
OF SOMETHING MUCH GREATER,

00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:13.333
AND IF YOUR FRIEND YUSEI
REALLY DOES HAVE A MARK,

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:14.901
THEN HE'S PART
OF IT, TOO.

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:19.406
FROM MY HAND
I SUMMON ASHOKA PILLAR

00:11:19.406 --> 00:11:20.907
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:24.111 --> 00:11:26.379
Computer: ASHOKA PILLAR
IS A MONSTER CARD THAT DEALS

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:28.882
2000 POINTS OF DAMAGE
TO ITS OWNER

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:31.118
WHEN IT IS DESTROYED.

00:11:31.118 --> 00:11:32.819
[PRISONERS LAUGHING]

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:36.189
"OOH, LOOK AT ME!
I JUST SUMMONED
A GIANT STICK!"

00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:37.691
NOW YOU GOT US
REALLY SCARED.

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:39.326
KNOCK IT OFF,
YOU TWO!

00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:41.161
AAH!

00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:42.896
I'M INTERESTED TO SEE
HOW MUCH HE CAN SQUEEZE

00:11:42.896 --> 00:11:44.531
OUTTA THIS DECK.

00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:46.833
YOU GOT ANOTHER
SURPRISE UP YOUR SLEEVE?

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:48.735
I'M ALL ABOUT SURPRISES.

00:11:48.735 --> 00:11:52.539
LIKE THIS NEXT CARD...
STONEHENGE!

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:54.407
SEE, THE POWER
OF STONEHENGE LETS ME

00:11:54.407 --> 00:11:56.176
SUMMON A MONSTER
WITH NO ATTACK POINTS

00:11:56.176 --> 00:11:58.879
FROM MY GRAVEYARD,
SO I'M SUMMONING CRYSTAL SKULL

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.280
IN DEFENSE POSITION.

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:11.858
IS YOUR SKULL AS EMPTY
AS THAT CRYSTAL SKULL?

00:12:11.858 --> 00:12:14.094
'CAUSE UNLESS YOU GOT
ANOTHER O' OF THOSE

00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:16.563
REFLECTION DOLLS
THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST
MOVE POSSIBLE.

00:12:16.563 --> 00:12:19.199
THINK AGAIN, BOYS.

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:21.668
GIANT USHI ONI
CAN ATTACK TWICE.

00:12:21.668 --> 00:12:23.570
IF HE HADN'T SUMMONED
THAT SKULL,

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.938
I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE
TO TAKE HIM OUT

00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:27.040
AFTER DEMOLISHING
HIS ASHOKA PILLAR.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.642
BUT WITH THAT
CRYSTAL SKULL IN THE WAY...

00:12:28.642 --> 00:12:31.578
USHI ONI'LL HAVE
TO ATTACK IT 'STEAD O' HIM!

00:12:31.578 --> 00:12:34.114
SO, UH, HE BASICALLY
SAVED HIMSELF

00:12:34.114 --> 00:12:35.882
FROM A BIG BEATIN'
BY TAKIN'

00:12:35.882 --> 00:12:37.384
A LITTLE
MEDIUM-SIZED BEATIN'?

00:12:37.384 --> 00:12:38.585
Tanner: YUP.

00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:40.620
EXCEPT HE MADE
ONE MAJOR MISTAKE.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.823
WHAT KINDA MISTAKE?

00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:44.758
WHEN USHI ONI
DEMOLISHES THAT PILLAR,

00:12:44.758 --> 00:12:47.227
HE'LL TAKE TWO-THOUSAND
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:49.763
SORRY KIDDO,
I WISH THAT
I COULD HAVE

00:12:49.763 --> 00:12:51.631
GIVEN YOU
A BETTER DECK.

00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:53.934
DON'T GIVE UP
ON YOUR DECK NOW, GRAMPS.

00:12:53.967 --> 00:12:56.002
HUH?

00:12:56.002 --> 00:12:59.639
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:03.510
[THINKING]
A TRAP CARD NOW IF ONLY
I CAN GET HIM TO USE IT.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.479
DON'T THINK THAT
FACEDOWN CARD CAN
SAVE YOU, KID.

00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:09.282
THIS IS THE SHRINE
OF ILIASTER.

00:13:09.282 --> 00:13:10.951
WHAT ARE THOSE
LITTLE DRAWINGS?

00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:12.252
THEY'RE CARVINGS, JACK.

00:13:12.252 --> 00:13:14.621
CARVINGS THAT NARRATE
ANCIENT MYTHS AND LEGENDS.

00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:17.591
HOW THE UNIVERSE BEGAN,
THE DAWN OF TIME,

00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:19.092
THE BIRTH
OF CIVILIZATION,

00:13:19.092 --> 00:13:20.827
THE CREATION OF MY ORDER,

00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:24.030
THE GREAT WAR
OF THE DEMONS.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.401
COME, JACK. LET ME TAKE
YOU ON A JOURNEY
THROUGH TIME.

00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:36.810
LONG AGO
IN THE PRE-INCAN CIVILIZATION

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.012
OF SOUTH AMERICA
THE PEOPLE OF THE STARS

00:13:39.012 --> 00:13:41.848
BUILT A GIANT BUILDING
OF STONE KNOWN AS

00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:43.216
THE STAIRWAY OF THE DRAGON.

00:13:43.216 --> 00:13:44.818
OKAAAY.

00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:48.388
THE STAIRWAY WAS BUILT
IN HONOR OF THE DRAGON STAR,

00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:50.590
WHICH WAS SAID TO GOVERN
ALL OF CREATION.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.159
ALL THE WISDOM HELD
BY THE STAR WAS HANDED DOWN

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:56.630
TO THEIR RULER
THE STAR DRAGON KING.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.665
LED BY THE STAR
AND THEIR KING,

00:13:58.665 --> 00:14:02.002
THE PEOPLE OF THE STARS
BUILT AN INCREDIBLE
CIVILIZATION.

00:14:02.002 --> 00:14:04.604
BUT THEN THE GATE
TO THE SHADOW REALM WAS OPENED.

00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:07.440
LEGENDS TELL OF EVIL
DEMONS AND SPIRITS LED

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.076
BY THE DEMON LORD,
ENGAGING IN A GREAT WAR.

00:14:10.076 --> 00:14:11.945
THE KING CLIMBED
THE STAIRWAY AND BEGGED

00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:14.281
THE DRAGON STAR
TO HELP HIS PEOPLE.

00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:17.083
AND THE DRAGON STAR
ANSWERED THE KING'S CRY.

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:19.252
THE GREAT CRIMSON DRAGON
CAME DOWN FROM ABOVE

00:14:19.252 --> 00:14:21.488
AND SWEPT OVER THE LAND,
SEALING THE FORCES

00:14:21.488 --> 00:14:23.823
OF EVIL DEEP
BENEATH THE EARTH.

00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:25.358
LIKE IN THE DIRT?

00:14:25.358 --> 00:14:27.160
PRECISELY.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.728
BEHOLD.

00:14:31.264 --> 00:14:33.566
ARE THOSE THE
LEGENDARY NAZCA LINES?

00:14:33.566 --> 00:14:36.102
THEY ARE THE SEALS
OF THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:14:36.102 --> 00:14:39.372
ALRIGHT, NEWBIE.
MY TURN!

00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:43.677
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH
YOUR LITTLE TRINKETS

00:14:43.677 --> 00:14:47.447
CAN STAND UP TO THIS MOVE!

00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:49.149
AAH! AAH!

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:54.020
GIANT USHI ONI,
TEAR DOWN THAT ASHOKA PILLAR!

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.856
I ACTIVATE
THE TOTEM POLE TRAP CARD!

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.928
[GROWLING]

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:07.701
HOW IN-CRED-IBLE!!

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:09.536
NO WAY!

00:15:09.536 --> 00:15:10.804
KEEP 'EM COMIN', TANNER,

00:15:10.804 --> 00:15:11.938
'CAUSE TOTEM POLE
CAN BLOCK YOUR

00:15:11.972 --> 00:15:14.074
MONSTERS' ATTACKS
UP TO THREE TIMES.

00:15:14.074 --> 00:15:16.209
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

00:15:16.209 --> 00:15:18.211
WITH MY DECK,
YOU'RE GONNA WIN!

00:15:18.211 --> 00:15:20.613
HA HA HA!

00:15:20.613 --> 00:15:22.816
YOU THINK I DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING?

00:15:22.816 --> 00:15:24.651
I WAS COUNTIN' ON IT!

00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:28.922
'CAUSE NOW I CAN BUILD
MY SPIDERWEB CASTLE!

00:15:28.922 --> 00:15:34.761
AND ITS ALL THANKS
TO YOU ACTIVATING
YOUR TRAP CARD!

00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.197
SO NOW IF YOUR
MONSTER ATTACKS,

00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:39.265
IT'LL GET CAUGHT IN MY WEB
AND ONLY BE ABLE TO USE HALF

00:15:39.265 --> 00:15:41.601
ITS ATTACK POINTS,
BUT THE BEST PART IS

00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:43.336
THAT I CAN ALSO JUST
SEND THE CARD TO MY

00:15:43.336 --> 00:15:46.172
GRAVEYARD AND THEN
JUMP PAST YOUR DEFENSE

00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:47.941
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK.

00:15:47.974 --> 00:15:51.111
I TAKE IT BACK, KID.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN.

00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:54.781
NOW I PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:58.785
[THINKING]
BRING IT ON, KID,
'CAUSE MY FIELD IS PERFECT.

00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:00.820
THANKS TO TRAP HOLE
IF YOU SUMMON A NEW MONSTER

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.090
WITH A THOUSAND
OR MORE ATTACK POINTS,
IT'LL GET DESTROYED.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.493
AND IF YOU SUMMON SOME
WEAKER ONES IN ATTACK POSITION,

00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:08.028
HOPING FOR
A STRAIGHT-UP BRAWL,

00:16:08.028 --> 00:16:10.196
I CAN USE MIRROR FORCE
TO WIPE 'EM OUT

00:16:10.196 --> 00:16:12.165
BEFORE THEY EVEN MOVE.

00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:14.868
THIS DUEL'S GOT ME ALL
FIRED UP, I LOVE IT!

00:16:14.868 --> 00:16:16.469
IT REMINDS ME
OF BETTER DAYS,

00:16:16.469 --> 00:16:19.706
BACK WHEN I WAS
ON MY WAY TO THE TOP
OF THE SPEED WORLD CIRCUIT.

00:16:19.706 --> 00:16:22.776
THE ROAR OF THE CROWD,
THE ENERGY IN THE AIR!

00:16:22.776 --> 00:16:24.744
HEART POUNDING,
BLOOD RACING.

00:16:24.744 --> 00:16:27.180
IT WAS THE GREATEST
FEELING IN THE WORLD

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.116
UNTIL I TOOK A RUN
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP

00:16:30.116 --> 00:16:32.919
AND JACK ATLAS
TOOK ME OUT IN ONE MOVE.

00:16:34.854 --> 00:16:39.059
THAT WAS THE MOST
HUMILIATING DEFEAT
OF MY CAREER.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:41.294
GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO
WAIT A LITTLE LONGER

00:16:41.294 --> 00:16:44.497
TO TAKE YOUR
VICTORY LAP HUH, TANNER?

00:16:44.497 --> 00:16:48.468
MAYBE NEXT TIME,
I'LL ACTUALLY TRY!

00:16:48.468 --> 00:16:52.372
IT WAS ALL DOWNHILL
FROM THERE,

00:16:52.372 --> 00:16:53.873
BUT I LIKE THIS KID.

00:16:53.873 --> 00:16:57.043
HE REMINDS ME
OF, WELL, OF ME.

00:16:57.043 --> 00:17:00.346
IT'S MY MOVE, TANNER.

00:17:00.346 --> 00:17:02.615
[THINKING]
I KNOW THIS DECK
WON'T LET ME DOWN.

00:17:06.186 --> 00:17:08.154
IF I CAN GET ONE MORE
MONSTER ON THE FIELD,

00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:09.456
I CAN WIN THIS.

00:17:09.456 --> 00:17:12.058
IF NOT, I'M A GONER.

00:17:32.492 --> 00:17:34.761
IT'S YOUR MOVE, NEWBIE.

00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:44.203
UH-OH, HE SMILED.

00:17:44.203 --> 00:17:48.541
I ACTIVATE
THE PIRI REIS MAP SPELL CARD!

00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:50.977
Computer: PIRI REIS MAP IS
A SPELL CARD THAT LETS YOU DRAW

00:17:50.977 --> 00:17:52.578
A ZERO ATTACK POINT MONSTER,

00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:55.748
BUT IF IT'S SUMMONED,
YOU LOSE HALF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:17:55.748 --> 00:17:58.184
WHAT CAN YA' DO
WITH SOME OLD PIECE OF PAPER?!

00:17:58.184 --> 00:18:00.453
IT'S NOT PAPER,
IT'S GAZELLE SKIN!

00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:01.554
IT WAS DRAWN BY
AN OTTOMAN-TURKISH
ADMIRAL NAMED...

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:02.755
THERE HE GOES AGAIN!

00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:04.924
ENOUGH WITH THE LECTURES,
PROFESSOR!

00:18:04.924 --> 00:18:07.026
THE PIRI REIS MAP CAN
SHOW A MONSTER

00:18:07.026 --> 00:18:09.061
WITH NO ATTACK POINTS
A CLEAR PATH

00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:11.030
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.466
SO DOES THAT MEAN
YOU GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD?

00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:15.434
I'M NOT JUST
DRAWING THE CARD...

00:18:15.434 --> 00:18:16.903
I'M SUMMONING IT!

00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:18.437
CABRERA STONE!

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:28.915
WHAT'S SOME
LITTLE ROCK GONNA DO?

00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:31.751
IT'S A STONE,
THE CABRERA STONE
TO BE EXACT!

00:18:31.751 --> 00:18:33.753
THEY SAY A LOST
CIVILIZATION...

00:18:33.753 --> 00:18:36.522
NOBODY CARES, OLD MAN!

00:18:36.522 --> 00:18:38.925
THIS IS AN
ARCHEOLOGICAL SPECTACLE!

00:18:38.925 --> 00:18:42.595
THE CRYSTAL SKULL,
A CABRERA STONE,
AN ASHOKA PILLAR!

00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:44.363
I'M GETTING
HISTORICAL
GOOSE BUMPS!

00:18:44.363 --> 00:18:46.332
THE WORLD'S
BEST MUSEUMS

00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:48.034
DON'T BOAST
COLLECTIONS
AS RARE AS THIS!

00:18:48.034 --> 00:18:51.003
SOMETHIN' I DON'T GET
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT MAP

00:18:51.003 --> 00:18:53.372
OF YOURS IS THAT YOU HAD
TO LOSE HALF YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:18:53.372 --> 00:18:56.075
IN ORDER TO SUMMON THAT ROCK
YOU ADDED TO YOUR HAND.

00:18:56.075 --> 00:18:58.744
THAT LEAVES YOU
WITH ONLY 200 LIFE POINTS.

00:18:58.744 --> 00:19:00.313
WHY WOULD YOU PUT
YOURSELF AT RISK

00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:03.249
LIKE THAT TO SUMMON SOMETHING
WITH NO ATTACK POINTS?

00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:05.852
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:19:05.852 --> 00:19:07.353
SORRY, TANNER,
BUT NOW THAT I'VE

00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:09.355
GATHERED CRYSTAL SKULL,
ASHOKA PILLAR,

00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:11.557
AND CABRERA STONE
ON MY FIELD TOGETHER,

00:19:11.557 --> 00:19:13.359
I CAN ACTIVATE
ANOTHER CARD.

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:14.594
IT CAN'T BE!

00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:18.497
I ACTIVATE THE SPELL CARD
TRIANGLE O!

00:19:30.276 --> 00:19:32.712
WHAT KINDA HOCUS
POCUS IS THIS?

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.585
[GROWLS]

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:40.686
OHH!

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:41.854
[ALL GASP]

00:19:41.854 --> 00:19:43.422
HE'S DEMOLISHING
EVERYTHING!

00:19:43.422 --> 00:19:44.724
AMAZING!

00:19:44.724 --> 00:19:48.194
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT THIS CAN
REALLY DO!

00:19:48.194 --> 00:19:51.731
TRIANGLE O'S POWER
DESTROYS EVERY CARD
ON THE FIELD.

00:19:54.934 --> 00:19:56.669
AND ALL THE DAMAGE
I WOULDA TAKEN 'CAUSE

00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:59.772
OF THE CARDS' EFFECTS
GETS DEALT TO YOU.

00:19:59.772 --> 00:20:02.108
RESPECT THAT, TANNER!

00:20:11.684 --> 00:20:14.220
I... I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:18.324
TANNER!
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:20:18.324 --> 00:20:20.893
DEAR BOY, DEAR BOY!
THAT WAS STUPENDOUS!

00:20:20.893 --> 00:20:22.228
I'VE TRAVELED
THE WORLD OVER,

00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:24.363
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
DUELING LIKE THAT.

00:20:24.363 --> 00:20:25.731
YOU NEVER EVEN
ATTACKED,

00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:27.199
HA HA!
I COULD HUG YOU,

00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:29.936
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I WON'T!

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:32.772
I COULDN'T'VE DONE IT
WITHOUT THIS AWESOME
DECK O' YOURS.

00:20:32.772 --> 00:20:35.775
ACTUALLY,
I WILL HUG YA!

00:20:35.775 --> 00:20:38.577
OH! UH...

00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:41.180
DON'T WORRY,
WE DON'T CARE
IF HE WON.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.815
HE'S STILL
SLIME TO US!

00:20:42.815 --> 00:20:44.850
YEAH AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE
THAT TREASURE DECK!

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:46.752
HANG ON.

00:20:46.752 --> 00:20:48.254
HANG ON
FOR WHAT?

00:20:48.254 --> 00:20:50.856
YOU WON A DUEL WITHOUT
EVER ATTACKING ONCE.

00:20:50.856 --> 00:20:54.026
THAT'S A PRETTY AMAZING
THING TO PULL OFF.

00:20:54.026 --> 00:20:56.595
AND I KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKIN' ABOUT, KID.

00:20:56.595 --> 00:20:57.897
THE OLD MAN WAS RIGHT.

00:20:57.897 --> 00:20:59.699
RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

00:20:59.699 --> 00:21:01.500
I USED TO BE A PRO.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.070
BUT I NEVER DUELED
SOMEONE QUITE LIKE YOU.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.706
YOU'RE GOOD.

00:21:06.706 --> 00:21:09.608
SO YOU GOT
A NAME NEWBIE?

00:21:09.642 --> 00:21:12.345
IT'S YUSEI.

00:21:12.345 --> 00:21:14.180
HEY, GRAMPS,
I APOLOGIZE

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.581
FOR STEPPING
ON YOUR CARDS.

00:21:15.614 --> 00:21:18.050
I HOPE YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON, TANNER!

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.986
NOW TAKE
A LOOK AT THESE.

00:21:19.986 --> 00:21:21.887
AREN'T
THEY WONDERFUL?

00:21:21.887 --> 00:21:23.389
YOU HAD ME DOUBTING
THEIR WORTH,

00:21:23.389 --> 00:21:26.792
BUT YUSEI SHOWED
ME HOW SPECIAL
THEY ARE!

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:29.328
MY TIME IN THE SPOTLIGHT
IS LONG GONE.

00:21:29.328 --> 00:21:30.997
BUT I WANNA DO
EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET

00:21:30.997 --> 00:21:33.232
YOU TO THE WORLD
OF THE PROS.

00:21:33.232 --> 00:21:36.836
WHADDYA SAY?
YOU INTERESTED?

00:21:36.836 --> 00:21:38.104
VERY.

00:21:42.274 --> 00:21:44.977
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
BREAK IT UP, FELLAS.

00:21:44.977 --> 00:21:46.679
LET'S GO, EIGHTY-EIGHT.

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:48.814
THE CHIEF WOULD
LIKE TO SEE YOU.

00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:50.082
NOW.

00:21:53.152 --> 00:21:55.688
MANY CENTURIES HAVE
PASSED SINCE

00:21:55.688 --> 00:21:57.423
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
SEALED THE DEMON LORD

00:21:57.423 --> 00:21:59.458
AND HIS FORCES
BENEATH THE EARTH.

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:02.561
BUT THOSE FORCES
CONTINUE TO DRAW
ENERGY FROM MANKIND.

00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:04.030
THEY FEED
OFF OF OUR SADNESS,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.766
OUR JEALOUSY,
OUR ANGER, OUR GREED.

00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:09.001
SOON, THE DEMON LORD'S
FORCES WILL GAIN

00:22:09.001 --> 00:22:11.103
MORE POWER THAN THEY
EVER HAD BEFORE.

00:22:11.103 --> 00:22:13.039
THEY WILL BREAK
THE DRAGON'S SEAL

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.673
AND RETURN TO PILLAGE
THE EARTH.

00:22:14.673 --> 00:22:15.708
THAT'S BAD.

00:22:15.708 --> 00:22:17.243
ON THE DAY THE SEAL BREAKS

00:22:17.243 --> 00:22:18.911
AND THE DEMON LORD
RESURRECTS,

00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:20.780
MY ORDER WILL BE
AND PREPARED TO SUMMON

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.349
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
AND PROTECT HUMANITY.

00:22:23.349 --> 00:22:25.584
BUT WE MUST FIND
THE SIGNERS,

00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:27.686
THOSE BEARING THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON.

00:22:27.686 --> 00:22:28.921
LIKE YOU.

00:22:28.921 --> 00:22:32.525
AND THAT SATELLITE YUSEI.

00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:34.927
SO I'M SUPPOSED
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

00:22:34.927 --> 00:22:36.595
WHY DIDN'T
YA SAY SO?
