500 LIFE POINTS

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:46.066
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
DESTROY YOUR MONSTER!

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:47.234
YUSEI, NO!

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.535
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

00:08:48.535 --> 00:08:50.837
YUSEI BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHING, AND FAST.

00:08:50.837 --> 00:08:53.373
Yanagi: I COULDN'T
AGREE WITH YOU
MORE, TANNER,

00:08:53.373 --> 00:08:57.310
ESPECIALLY WITH
THOSE CLOUDS CIRCLING
AROUND LIKE THAT.

00:09:04.284 --> 00:09:05.352
HERE IT COMES!

00:09:05.352 --> 00:09:07.053
THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:08.054
SWEET.
[GASP]

00:09:08.054 --> 00:09:10.357
TH-TH-TH-TH-THIS
IS BAD!

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:21.334
[ROARING]

00:09:26.173 --> 00:09:28.542
I... I SEE IT, BUT I DO NOT
BELIEVE IT!

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:29.910
IT'S A THIRD DRAGON!

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.646
HOLD ON. WHO SUMMONED
THAT THING TO THE FIELD?

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:36.183
THE CRIMSON DRAGON.
IT'S HUGE!

00:09:36.183 --> 00:09:39.619
MY ARM.
IT'S GLOWING AGAIN!

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.155
[GASPING]

00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:43.990
IT CAN'T BE!

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.959
THEY ACTUALLY AWAKENED YOU?!

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:50.597
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:55.135
SO MUCH POWER.
LAZAR, GET ME ZIGZIX NOW.

00:09:55.135 --> 00:09:56.136
MMM.

00:09:57.704 --> 00:09:59.139
IT'S WORKING!

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:01.441
WE'RE ABSORBING
THE DRAGON'S ENER-DEEEE!

00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:04.344
AAH! I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMETHING SO POWERFUL!

00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:06.713
HA HA HA! HMM?

00:10:06.713 --> 00:10:10.383
ZIGZIX, YOU MUST
SHUT DOWN THE
REACTOR IMMEDIATELY.

00:10:10.383 --> 00:10:11.451
EXCUSE ME?!

00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:12.986
BUT IT'S WORKING
PERFECTLY!

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:14.454
THERE'S ENOUGH
ENER-D HERE

00:10:14.454 --> 00:10:15.889
TO POWER THE CITY
FOR 100 YEARS!

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:17.057
IT'S A SUCCESS!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.059
WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS.

00:10:19.092 --> 00:10:22.596
ZIGZIX, IF YOU DON'T
SHUT THE REACTOR DOWN
IMMEDIATELY,

00:10:22.596 --> 00:10:25.265
THEN THERE MIGHT NOT
BE A CITY LEFT TO POWER.

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:27.367
I'M SURE
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:29.002
"WON'T BE A CITY LEFT?"

00:10:29.002 --> 00:10:30.670
UH...

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.073
Computer voice:
WARNING. THE ENER-D
REACTOR IS OVERLOADING.

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:34.641
PLEASE SHUT DOWN CORE.

00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:36.343
MELTDOWN IS IMMINENT.

00:10:39.145 --> 00:10:40.780
MELTDOWN?

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.682
OH, PLEASE, NOT AGAIN!

00:10:42.682 --> 00:10:46.186
WE CAN'T LET WHAT HAPPENED TO
GRIEGER'S VILLAGE HAPPEN HERE.

00:10:49.322 --> 00:10:50.991
AAH!

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:53.927
WE MUST SHUT DOWN THE REACTOR
IMMEDIATELY!

00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:57.497
THAT DRAGON HAS THE POWER
TO DESTROY EVERYTHING
IN NEW DOMINO CITY!

00:11:00.033 --> 00:11:01.635
[ROARING]

00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:24.316

NOW WATCH AND WITNESS
HOW YOUR FUTURE MASTER
RULES THIS DUEL!

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.088
JACK! BE CAREFUL!

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:32.191
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
MIGHT RIP

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.559
AND EVERYONE IN IT!

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.327
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SCARED!

00:11:35.327 --> 00:11:39.364
I AM A SIGNER, YUSEI FUDO,

AND IT SHALL, JACK,

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:48.774
BUT YOU WILL NOT FIGHT THE
DARKNESS THAT IS COMING ALONE.

00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:52.077
LEGEND SAYS THAT
ONCE ALL 5 SIGNERS ARE GATHERED,

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:54.279
THE FUTURE CAN BE REVEALED.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:58.183

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.095
WHAT ARE THEY

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:29.841
HEY, JACK,

HE SAID SOMEHOW
WE'RE ALL LINKED
TO THE CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:13:42.387 --> 00:13:45.424

A LOT LIKE
THE SATELLITE, JACK!

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:50.295

WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

00:13:53.565 --> 00:13:55.567
LUNA, LOOK THERE!

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:59.237
IS THAT A GIANT SPIDER
SURROUNDING NEW DOMINO CITY?

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:06.244
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING!

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:08.146
WE HAVE'TA STOP IT!

00:14:08.146 --> 00:14:09.348
IT CAN'T BE REAL.

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:11.083
PERHAPS IT'S THE FUTURE.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:12.317
WELL IF THAT'S
THE FUTURE,

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:14.386

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.154

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:19.858
WHAT?

00:14:19.858 --> 00:14:21.560
YUSEI, THIS IS A DUEL.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.662
THE CRIMSON DRAGON
WON'T LET EITHER OF US
GO BACK

00:14:23.662 --> 00:14:25.230
UNTIL ONE OF US WINS!

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.331

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:27.432
DON'T YOU GET IT?

00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:28.867
DUELING BROUGHT US HERE,

00:14:28.867 --> 00:14:30.602
AND DUELING'S GONNA
BRING US BACK HOME.

00:14:30.602 --> 00:14:32.571
AND WHOEVER WINS
WILL SHOW THE CRIMSON DRAGON

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.173
THEY DESERVE THE POWER
TO SAVE THE WORLD!

00:14:35.173 --> 00:14:37.843
AND I'M GOING TO BE
THAT PERSON!

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:40.312
I THROWDOWN TWO FACEDOWNS!

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:41.380

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.548
YOU'RE NUTS!

00:14:43.548 --> 00:14:44.916
BUT IF YOU WANT TO
KEEP DUELING,

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:48.387
THEN YOU'LL GET
MORE THAN YOU
BARGAINED FOR, JACK!

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:51.023
I JUST ACTIVATED
SILVER CONTRAILS!

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:52.791
IT GIVES 1,000
MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.860
TO ANY WIND MONSTER
ON MY FIELD,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.062
AND GUESS WHAT
MY MIGHTY BEAST IS!

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.563
STARDUST DRAGON,

00:14:58.563 --> 00:14:59.965
ATTACK RED DRAGON

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:03.035
AND TAKE US HOME!

THAT ATTACK...

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:10.042
I COULD FEEL IT
LIKE IT WAS REAL!

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.943
I GUESS THE CRIMSON DRAGON
WANTS YUSEI AND I

00:15:11.943 --> 00:15:13.545
TO PLAY FOR KEEPS.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.514
WELL,
THAT'S JUST FINE BY ME!

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:17.015
NEXT I ACTIVATE
MY TRAP:

00:15:17.015 --> 00:15:19.217
SYNCHRO BLAST!

00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:21.286
[SCREAMING]

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.157
AND YOU THOUGHT
I HAD SHORT MEMORY.

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:27.826
SINCE HYPER SYNCHRON
HELPED SUMMONED
BOTH OUR DRAGONS OUT,

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:31.863
NEITHER ONE CAN BE
DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:36.201
I'LL THROWDOWN
3 FACEDOWNS
N' END MY TURN.

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:38.070
[THINKING]
3 FACEDOWNS?!

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.472
LOOKS LIKE YUSEI'S
MAKING HIS BIG MOVE.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.474
TOO BAD IT'S TOO LATE!

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:44.176
NO MATTER
WHAT HE'S GOT HIDDEN,

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.312
MY SPEED SPELL OVERBURST
WILL DESTROY IT!

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.750
HERE WE GO!

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.185
I CAN'T SLAY YOUR DRAGON,

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:55.720
BUT I CAN STILL
TAKE OUT YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.857
GO, RED DRAGON
ARCHFIEND, ATTACK!

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.028
UNH!

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.496
YUSEI!

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.164
HE'S REALLY HURT!

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:08.533
IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN I DUEL PEOPLE!

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.136
WHAT WAS THAT?!
I COULD FEEL
HIS ATTACK!

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.571
Jack: THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI -

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.840
THIS DUEL IS
WINNER TAKE ALL!

00:16:29.387 --> 00:16:32.348
JACK! THE DAMAGE WE TAKE
IN THIS DUEL IS REAL!

00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:33.682
THAT'S RIGHT, PAL,

00:16:33.682 --> 00:16:35.551
AND NOW YOU'LL SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DUEL

00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:37.586
WITH MORE THAN
JUST YOUR LIFE POINTS
ON THE LINE.

00:16:37.586 --> 00:16:39.455
[GROWL] YOU DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE!

00:16:39.455 --> 00:16:41.257
BUT IF IT IS,
THEN I PLAN ON
DEFENDING MYSELF

00:16:41.257 --> 00:16:43.125
AND TAKING YOU DOWN!

00:16:43.125 --> 00:16:45.494
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP
CROSSLINE COUNTER!

00:16:45.494 --> 00:16:47.730
NOW IF I TAKE
BATTLE DAMAGE
DURING YOUR TURN,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:49.932
I DOUBLE IT AND ADD IT
AS ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:49.932 --> 00:16:52.768
PLUS, NOW MY DRAGON
GETS TO ATTACK YOU!

00:16:52.768 --> 00:16:54.837
HEH. WELL?
WHADDYA WAITIN' FOR?!

00:16:54.837 --> 00:16:56.138
STARDUST DRAGON,

00:16:56.138 --> 00:16:58.807
LETS NOT KEEP HIM
WAITING ANY LONGER!

00:17:01.043 --> 00:17:04.013
AAH! UNH.

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:05.214
JACK?!

00:17:05.214 --> 00:17:06.815
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME!

00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:09.451
IN FACT, YOU SHOULD BE
A LOT MORE CONCERNED
WITH YOURSELF!

00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:12.421
I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED SPELL OVERBOOST!

00:17:14.623 --> 00:17:17.760
SO NOW I GET 4 EXTRA
SPEED COUNTERS THIS ROUND,

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.461
NEARLY MAXIN' ME OUT!

00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:20.829
WITH THAT KIND OF POWER,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.331
THERE'S NOT TELLING
WHAT HE'LL PLAY NEXT.

00:17:22.331 --> 00:17:23.732
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:17:23.732 --> 00:17:25.768
SO GET READY FOR ME
TO CALL ON ONE OF
MY FAVORITES!

00:17:25.768 --> 00:17:27.436
NOW, FROM MY HAND,

00:17:27.436 --> 00:17:30.205
I PLAY THE SPEED SPELL,
END OF THE STORM.

00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:34.910
AND WITH THE POWER OF
THIS CARD, YUSEI,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.879
I CAN NOW PUT YOU
IN YOUR PLACE...

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:39.315
AND SINCE FIRST PLACE
IS GOING TO BE ALL MINE,

00:17:39.315 --> 00:17:41.517
I GUESS THAT YOU'LL
HAVE TO SETTLE FOR SECOND.

00:17:41.517 --> 00:17:43.652
I'M NOT SETTLING
FOR ANYTHING, JACK!

00:17:43.652 --> 00:17:46.322
AND THAT'S BECAUSE
STARDUST DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:17:46.322 --> 00:17:49.124
CAN COUNTER
YOUR END OF STORM.

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:52.561
PERHAPS,
BUT AT WHAT COST?

00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.929
JUST LOOK!

00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:56.565
THAT COUNTER ONLY WORKS
IF YOU SACRIFICE STARDUST,

00:17:56.565 --> 00:17:58.801
AND WITH HIM GONE,
YOU'RE WIDE OPEN!

00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:01.537
MAKING THIS
THE PERFECT TIME
FOR MY FAVORITE TRAP:

00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:03.572
THE SNEAK EXPLODER!

00:18:03.572 --> 00:18:05.741
SO DURING YOUR NEXT
STANDBY PHASE,

00:18:05.741 --> 00:18:07.543
YOU LOSE 500 LIFE POINTS

00:18:07.543 --> 00:18:09.645
FOR EVERY MONSTER
ON MY FIELD.

00:18:09.645 --> 00:18:11.714
AND SINCE I'VE GOT ONE,

00:18:11.714 --> 00:18:13.282
THAT MEANS YOUR LIFE POINTS
DON'T STAND A CHANCE!

00:18:13.282 --> 00:18:16.418
OH, NO! THAT TRAP
WILL FINISH YUSEI OFF,

00:18:16.418 --> 00:18:18.120
AND NEXT ROUND,
HE'LL LOSE!

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.289
THEN I BETTER KEEP
THIS ROUND GOIN'!

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:23.425
SO I ACTIVATE
STARDUST DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:23.425 --> 00:18:26.061
AND BRING HIM BACK
TO THE FIELD.

00:18:26.061 --> 00:18:28.464
AND THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
METEOR STREAM!

00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:29.932
Computer: METEOR STREAM
IS A TRAP CARD

00:18:29.932 --> 00:18:32.635
THAT DEALS 1,000 POINTS
OF DAMAGE TO YOUR OPPONENT

00:18:32.635 --> 00:18:33.869
WHEN YOU RE-SUMMON A MONSTER

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:36.939
THAT WAS RELEASED
DURING THE SAME TURN.

00:18:36.939 --> 00:18:39.975
STARDUST DRAGON,
END THIS NOW!

00:18:39.975 --> 00:18:42.177
JUST WHAT I WAS
WAITING FOR!
HUH?

00:18:42.177 --> 00:18:44.013
THERE'S A REASON
I'M THE CHAMP!

00:18:44.013 --> 00:18:46.148
JACK ATLAS IS DESTINED
FOR GREAT THINGS,

00:18:46.148 --> 00:18:48.617
WHILE YOU'RE JUST
DESTINED FOR DEFEAT!

00:18:48.617 --> 00:18:50.185
THIS ADVENTURE'S OVER.

00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:52.454
I PLAY CRIMSON FIRE!

00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:55.090
NOT ONLY DOES IT BLOCK
YOUR THOUSAND-POINT TRAP,

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.326
BUT IT BOOMERANGS IT
RIGHT BACK TO YOU,

00:18:57.326 --> 00:18:59.294
AT DOUBLE THE DAMAGE!

00:18:59.294 --> 00:19:00.295
GOOD-BYE, YUSEI!

00:19:02.531 --> 00:19:04.333
WATCH OUT!

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:06.769
SORRY JACK,
BUT I PLAY MY TRAP:

00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:08.804
SHINING SILVER FORCE!

00:19:08.804 --> 00:19:10.305
WHICH DOUSES
YOUR COMEBACK

00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:13.342
AND DESTROYS ALL
THE SPELLS AND TRAPS
ON YOUR FIELD!

00:19:15.511 --> 00:19:16.679
[GRUNT]

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:18.614
YOU'RE STILL
AS ANNOYING AS EVER!

00:19:18.614 --> 00:19:20.349
I NEVER WAS
ONE TO GIVE UP,

00:19:20.349 --> 00:19:22.484
AND WITH YOUR
SPEED COUNTERS ABOUT
TO RUN OUT OF GAS,

00:19:22.484 --> 00:19:26.422
I DON'T PLAN ON STARTING
ANYTIME SOON!

00:19:28.691 --> 00:19:30.592
HOW'S THE NEW VIEW?

00:19:30.592 --> 00:19:33.095
[GROWLING]

00:19:33.095 --> 00:19:34.563
SEE YA, JACK!

00:19:35.564 --> 00:19:37.866
TIME TO GET US HOME!

00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:43.806
I PLAY MY TRAP
FINAL ATTACK!

00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:45.974
AND SINCE I HAVE
8 SPEED COUNTERS,

00:19:45.974 --> 00:19:49.945
THE ATTACK POINTS
OF MY STARDUST DRAGON
ARE DOUBLED!

00:19:49.945 --> 00:19:51.080
[ROARING]

00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:57.553
5,000?!
IT'S TOO POWERFUL!

00:19:57.553 --> 00:19:59.321
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU, JACK,

00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:01.290
BUT IF ENDING THIS DUEL
IS THE ONLY WAY HOME,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.058
THEN I GOTTA ATTACK!

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.895
STARDUST DRAGON,
TAKE OUT HIS LIFE POINTS!

00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:21.844

Announcer: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:20:36.225 --> 00:20:38.227
WE SEEM TO BE EXPERIENCING SOME
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:39.294
AT THIS MOMENT.

00:20:39.294 --> 00:20:40.662
YOUR PATIENCE IS APPRECIATED

00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:42.564
AS WE TRY TO SORT
THIS MATTER OUT.

00:20:42.564 --> 00:20:43.899
[OFF MICROPHONE]
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME

00:20:43.899 --> 00:20:45.834
WHY THESE TWO DRAGONS HAVE
BEEN FROZEN IN MID-AIR?

00:20:45.834 --> 00:20:47.903
GET THE DIRECTOR ON THE LINE!

00:20:54.076 --> 00:20:55.410
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.411
FIRST, THEY
WERE DUELING,

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:57.780
THEN
THEY DISAPPEARED,

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.249
NOW THEY'RE BACK,
AND THEIR DRAGONS
ARE GONE!

00:21:00.249 --> 00:21:02.284
OHH!
LOOK THERE!

00:21:02.284 --> 00:21:05.687
CHECK OUT JACK'S
LIFE POINTS!

THE RIGHT SCORE?

00:21:07.689 --> 00:21:11.126
YUSEI WON.
HE'S THE CHAMPION NOW.

00:21:11.126 --> 00:21:12.327
HUH?

00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:22.571
ARE YOU OK?!

00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:24.473
YOU BEAT ME.

00:21:24.473 --> 00:21:26.141
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT, YUSEI,

00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.077
BUT YOU'RE THE CHAMP NOW.

00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:30.379
IF THAT VISION WAS TRUE,

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.914
NONE OF THIS MATTERS,

00:21:31.914 --> 00:21:33.916
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
WE ALL MIGHT LOSE.

00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:35.083
WE'RE IN DANGER,

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.485
AND OUR CITIES
MIGHT BE DESTROYED.

00:21:36.485 --> 00:21:37.586
AND WE HAVE TO UNITE

00:21:37.586 --> 00:21:39.454
TO STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING.

00:21:39.454 --> 00:21:41.523
YOU ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE A HERO.

00:21:41.523 --> 00:21:43.292
NOW HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.

FROM THE DIRECTOR?

THE DUEL'S OVER.

00:21:49.431 --> 00:21:51.567
THE WINNER'S YUSEI;
TELL THEM ALL.
