I CAN SUMMON OUT
A COMPASS TOKEN.

00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:47.967
SINCE YOU'VE GOT
THOR AND LOKI OUT,

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:49.969
I CAN SUMMON
TWO TOKENS.

00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:56.909
NEXT UP, I'LL PLAY TWO FACEDOWN
CARDS AND END MY TURN.

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:58.878
(CROWD GASPS)

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.480
THREE
MONSTERS ALREADY?

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.350
MAN, YUSEI IS NOT
WASTING ANY TIME, IS HE?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.818
IT WAS
A SMART OPEN.

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:08.621
HE'S GOT TO BUILD A GOOD DEFENSE
AGAINST THOSE GOD CARDS.

00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:10.590
I CAN'T BELIEVE
TEAM 5D's WAS ABLE

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.124
TO DRAG HALLDOR
OUT TO DUEL.

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:15.261
WE HAVE SERIOUSLY
UNDERESTIMATED THESE GUYS.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.896
THAT'S TOTALLY
MY BAD.

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.898
I SHOULDA BEEN ABLE
TO TAKE CROW OUT.

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.533
I HAD HIM,
BUT I GOT COCKY.

00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:23.336
NOT TRUE.
YOU NEVER HAD HIM.

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:25.972
THESE GUYS ARE GOOD,
BRODER,

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.741
BUT THEY'RE
NO MATCH FOR HALLDOR.

00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:32.745
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN ANYONE RATTLE THIS GUY.

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:34.580
HALLDOR IS
A TRUE GENIUS.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.083
HE'S OPERATING ON A
WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.451
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.421
MAYBE, BUT FIRST
I REVEAL MY TRAP.

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:43.422
IT'S MONSTER CHAIN.

00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:46.592
USING THIS CARD'S
POWER,

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.327
I CAN NEGATE
ONE BATTLE PHASE

00:18:48.327 --> 00:18:50.429
FOR EVERY MONSTER
OUT ON MY FIELD.

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:52.298
SINCE I'VE GOT THREE
MONSTERS OUT,

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.300
WE CAN'T ATTACK
FOR THREE TURNS.

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:59.939
LOKI'S TRAP DESTRUCTION ABILITY
ACTIVATES WHEN HE ATTACKS.

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:02.708
THIS OUGHTA HOLD
HIM OFF FOR A WHILE.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.845
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK
THAT YOU CAN BIND THE GODS?

00:19:05.845 --> 00:19:08.314
YOUR CHEAP PARLOR
TRICKS ARE MEANINGLESS!

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:10.383
UH-OH.

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:15.054
I SUMMON THE VALKYRIE OF THE
NORDIC ASCENDANT TUNER MONSTER

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:18.791

<i>WITH 400 ATTACK POINTS</i>

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.668
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH THAT?

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.504
MY VALKYRIE IS SIMPLY
A HERALD, YUSEI,

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.606
BECAUSE WHEN
SHE'S SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:36.809
I CAN SEND TWO CARDS FROM MY
HAND TO MY GRAVEYARD IN ORDER

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:40.546
TO SUMMON TWO EINHERJAR
TOKENS IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.350
NO WAY. IT CAN'T BE.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.686
IT CAN BE.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.355
PREPARE TO BE IN THE
PRESENCE OF GREATNESS.

00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:53.192
