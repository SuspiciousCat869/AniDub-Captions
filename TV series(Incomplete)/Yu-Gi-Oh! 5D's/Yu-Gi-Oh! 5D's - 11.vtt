00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:45.139
GRAB MY HAND!

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.209
ALMOST THERE...

00:09:48.209 --> 00:09:49.944
Blister: WE WERE GONNA
SLAM INTO A BUILDING.

00:09:49.944 --> 00:09:52.613
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO THINK,
I JUST TURNED AWAY.

00:09:54.916 --> 00:10:01.222
AERO... OH, NO...
AERO... LOOK OUT!

00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.125
HE WAS STUCK IN THE SIDECAR,
HE HAD NO CONTROL.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:05.526
IT WAS BAD...

00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:07.662
HE SPENT 8 MONTHS
IN RECOVERY.

00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:11.999
WHEN HE GOT OUT
HE QUIT DUELING.

00:10:11.999 --> 00:10:13.568
I NEVER HEARD
FROM HIM AGAIN...

00:10:13.568 --> 00:10:15.536
EXCEPT FOR THIS CARD
HE SENT ME...

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:17.805
IT WAS HIS PART
OF OUR BEST COMBO.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.175
IT'S ALL
TORN AND BURNED.

00:10:21.175 --> 00:10:23.110
I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS
HIS WAY OF SAYING

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.846
HE'D NEVER FORGIVE ME.

00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:27.815
HEH... NOT THAT
I BLAME HIM,

00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:30.785
I WOULDN'T FORGIVE ME
EITHER IF I WAS HIM.

00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:33.621
DON'T TAKE THIS RISK
FOR YOUR FRIENDS, YUSEI.

00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:35.022
'CAUSE COME CRUNCH TIME,

00:10:35.022 --> 00:10:38.259
THEY'RE GONNA
LET YOU DOWN,
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

I LET MY BEST FRIEND
CRASH RIGHT INTO
A BUILDING

00:10:42.029 --> 00:10:43.564
JUST TO SAVE MYSELF.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.373

ON YOURSELF BLISTER,

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:54.008

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:00.448
[THINKING] I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.

00:11:00.448 --> 00:11:03.217
FRIENDS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING A PERSON CAN HAVE.

00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:04.919
WITHOUT THEM, YOU'RE NOTHING.

00:11:06.554 --> 00:11:08.155
I KNOW WHAT I DID WAS WRONG,

00:11:08.155 --> 00:11:10.892
BUT DID YOU REALLY HAVE
TO THROW IT IN MY FACE AERO...

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.040
BLISTER WAS RIGHT ABOUT
THOSE SECURITY DROIDS.

00:12:23.874 --> 00:12:25.275

00:12:29.246 --> 00:12:31.548
TOP FLOOR HERE I COME...

00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:40.024

00:12:41.492 --> 00:12:44.428
NOW I JUST HOPE THIS I.D.
AND PASS CODE WORK...

00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:49.767

00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:06.984
I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU LIKE ME, YUSEI!

00:13:06.984 --> 00:13:09.019
WHY ELSE
WOULD YOU CONSTANTLY
GO OUT OF YOUR WAY

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:11.255
TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP
MEETING UP LIKE THIS?

00:13:11.255 --> 00:13:13.357
ALTHOUGH, I GOTTA SAY,
THIS IS PROBABLY

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.325
YOUR CRAZIEST STUNT YET.

00:13:15.325 --> 00:13:17.094
WHAT ON EARTH
WERE YOU THINKING?

00:13:17.094 --> 00:13:20.297
I JUST WANT MY DUEL
RUNNER BACK, TRUDGE,
IT IS MINE.

00:13:20.297 --> 00:13:22.232
ACTUALLY... THAT RUNNER

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:25.002
IS NOW THE PROPERTY
OF SECTOR SECURITY.

00:13:25.002 --> 00:13:26.870
IT'S GONNA BE
A PATROL BIKE!

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.938
OR MAYBE
THEY'LL SCRAP IT

00:13:27.938 --> 00:13:29.673
AND TURN IT INTO
A BUNCH OF TOASTERS,

00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:31.241
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:34.978
AS FOR YOU, IT'S
BACK TO THE FACILITY!

00:13:34.978 --> 00:13:36.380
GET 'EM, BOYS!

00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:42.586
HEH! SORRY YUSEI, BUT
THAT RUNNER IS OFFLINE.

00:13:42.586 --> 00:13:45.022
SO JUST
COME ON OUT QUIETLY.

00:13:45.022 --> 00:13:46.490

00:13:59.136 --> 00:14:00.804

GET AWAY!

00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:03.741

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:12.816
COME ON, YUSEI!

00:14:12.816 --> 00:14:15.586
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
ESCAPE FROM ME AGAIN?

00:14:15.586 --> 00:14:17.955
I'LL NEVER STOP CHASING YOU,
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

00:14:19.723 --> 00:14:21.091
CHASE THIS!

00:14:21.091 --> 00:14:23.260
SO THAT'S HOW YOU WANNA
PLAY THINGS, IS IT?...

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.429
TELL YOU WHAT...
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL...

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:27.264
GIVE YOURSELF UP
RIGHT NOW.

00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:28.265
AND I'LL FORGET THE FACT

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:29.333
THAT YOU BROKE
INTO THE VAULT

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:30.901
WHEN I'M FILLING OUT
THE REPORT.

00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:32.035
NO CHANCE!

YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME
ANY CHOICE HERE.

00:14:34.304 --> 00:14:35.439
IF YOU WON'T SURRENDER,

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:37.007
I'LL HAVE TO
MAKE YOU SURRENDER...

WHILE I LOAD UP THE BUILDING
SCHEMATICS TO FIND A WAY OUT.

00:14:53.457 --> 00:14:57.227
ALRIGHT, TRUDGE...
BRING IT ON.

THROUGH THAT OPENING...
