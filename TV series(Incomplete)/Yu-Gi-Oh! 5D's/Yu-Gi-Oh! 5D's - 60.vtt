WEBVTT

00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:03.400
NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
ON "YU-GI-OH 5D's"!

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.836
HERE'S THE LOCATION
OF THE FOUR CONTROL STATIONS.

00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:09.473
GIANT, HUMMINGBIRD,
LIZARD AND MONKEY.

00:00:09.473 --> 00:00:10.807
THEY'RE PRETTY
SPREAD OUT.

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:11.975
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:13.343
HIT ALL THESE
UNITS ONE BY ONE?

00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:15.011
THAT WOULD BE
A HUGE WASTE
OF TIME.

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.748
BESIDES A DUEL
IS ONE-ON-ONE.

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:20.016
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO SPLIT UP
AND GO SOLO.

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:22.419
FOUR SIGNERS.
FOUR CONTROL
STATIONS.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.687
IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:24.888
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE THIS IS

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.957
MORE OF GOODWIN'S
DESTINY AT WORK.

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:28.258
THE LIZARD IS
MISTY'S MARK.

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:30.494
I'LL HEAD OVER
TO THAT STATION.

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:31.495
YUSEI!

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.029
NO!!

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:36.166
YUSEI'S JUST
GOTTA BE ALRIGHT!

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.401
AND HE IS.
YUSEI'S A SURVIVOR.

00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.569
THAT MUCH WE KNOW.

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.004
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
IS WHERE THIS
GLOWING LAKE

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.273
OF LIGHT TOOK HIM.

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:45.542
[THINKING]
SOME MYSTERY MAN
SAVES ME FROM A GANG

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:49.613
OF GRABBY GHOULS AND THEN
VANISHES WITHOUT A TRACE?

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:52.382
WHERE'S THAT
LIGHT COMING FROM?

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:55.619
I GOTTA FIND OUT.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.255
LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
THE END OF THE ROAD.

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:01.992
Man: NO. THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING
FOR YOU, YUSEI.

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:04.261
WHY'D YOU SAVE ME FROM
THOSE SPIRITS EARLIER?

00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.262
WHO ARE YOU?

00:01:05.262 --> 00:01:06.830
WHO AM I?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.864
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR OWN DAD?

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:10.967
FATHER?
BUT YOU'RE...

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.470
LISTEN TO ME, YUSEI,
THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.005
THERE IS STILL MUCH
FOR YOU TO DO BACK

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.007
IN THE SATELLITE SECTOR.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:18.775
WAIT!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:01:18.775 --> 00:01:21.011
YOU ARE DESTINED
FOR GREAT THINGS.

00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:23.380
BUT YOU MUST RISE
TO THAT GREATNESS

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.781
IF YOU ARE TO
ACHIEVE THEM.

00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:26.750
FATHER!
DON'T LEAVE ME!

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.285
I WILL ALWAYS
BE WITH YOU.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.587
NO, FATHER,
COME BACK!

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.959
Trudge: IS THAT...

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.729
Both: YEAH, IT'S YUSEI!

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.464
Crow: YUSEI,
OPEN YOUR EYES!

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:45.535
Leo: SAY SOMETHING!

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:47.604
I'M FINE. THANKS FOR LOOKING
OUT FOR ME, YOU GUYS.

00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:49.739
NO PROB.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:51.241
NOW TO LOOK OUT FOR
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.977
WE HAVE TO SEAL
THE REMAINING
TWO TOWERS BY SUNSET,

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.480
OR THE KING
OF THE NETHERWORLD
WILL RESURRECT!

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.882
HUH?

00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:01.484
CHECK IT OUT, YUSEI!

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:04.654
DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS
THAT JACK WON HIS DUEL?

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:05.755
YEAH, SURE IT DOES!

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:08.725
THEN THERE'S JUST ONE
TOWER LEFT TO SEAL,

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:10.493
AND I HAVE A BAD FEELING
IT'S GOING TO BE

00:02:10.493 --> 00:02:13.296

TOBY, I MISS YOU.

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:47.924
Leo: THE ONLY
CONTROL TOWER LEFT

00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:49.693
IS THE ONE AKIZA
WENT TO, RIGHT?

00:03:49.693 --> 00:03:51.461
Yusei: YEAH,
BUT SHE NEEDS TO HURRY.

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.596
IF SHE DOESN'T TAKE
IT DOWN BEFORE SUNSET,

00:03:53.596 --> 00:03:55.865
THE GATE TO
THE NETHERWORLD WILL OPEN.

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:58.234
[THINKING]
I HOPE AKIZA'S OKAY.

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:00.737
Akiza: I'VE DUELED
MISTY BEFORE.

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:03.473
SHE IS NOT
MY BIGGEST FAN.

00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:06.443
YOU COULDN'T CARE LESS
ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU

00:04:06.443 --> 00:04:09.012
HURT, COULD YOU, AKIZA?

00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:13.483
MY BROTHER IS GONE,
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:15.485
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
TO HER BROTHER?

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:17.253
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO HE IS.

00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:19.622
MAYBE SHE'S JUST GOT
YOU CONFUSED

00:04:19.622 --> 00:04:20.757
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:22.692
NO.

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:24.494
IT'S DEFINITELY
ME SHE'S AFTER.

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.630
AS FOR HER BROTHER,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.265
BUT I CAN'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:31.301
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS DEFEATING MISTY

00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.436
AND SEALING THAT
CONTROL TOWER.

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:40.877
SHE'S GOTTA BE
IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:42.479
LET'S SPLIT UP.

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.314
IF PURPLE FIRE STARTS
TO SURROUND YOU,

00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:45.582
YOU SHOULD...
YOU KNOW... RUN.

00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:48.218
RIGHT.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:54.824
[THINKING]
WHERE ARE YOU, MISTY?

00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:02.432
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY GOT HERE OKAY.

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:05.168
Leo: WHAT IF THEY
DUELED ALREADY
AND AKIZA LOST?

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.269
Luna: LEO.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:08.738
COME ON... LET'S GO
FIND OUR FRIENDS.

00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:14.944
RUN-DOWN CARNIVALS
ARE NOT RIGHT.

00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:17.414
THEY'RE SO CREEPY
WHEN THEY'RE EMPTY.

00:05:17.414 --> 00:05:18.748
Man: YOU CAN SAY
THAT AGAIN.

00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:19.949
WHO IS THAT!?

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.418
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO STARTLE YOU.

00:05:21.418 --> 00:05:23.820
I WORK FOR
DIRECTOR GOODWIN.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.855
THERE'S NO TIME
FOR ME TO EXPLAIN
THINGS HERE,

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:27.457
BUT I NEED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

00:05:27.457 --> 00:05:30.293
WHO ARE YOU?

00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.294
ANYBODY HERE?

00:05:31.294 --> 00:05:33.563
ALL YE ALL YE OXEN FREE!

00:05:33.563 --> 00:05:34.531
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:36.366
AKIZA!

00:05:41.504 --> 00:05:43.606
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE
IT, BLACK ROSE.

00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:45.308
COME ON IN.

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:49.546
HA HA HA!

00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:53.283
HEY!

00:05:53.283 --> 00:05:55.685
AAH!

00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:58.488
DON'T BOTHER
TRYING TO LEAVE.

00:05:58.488 --> 00:05:59.689
MISTY?

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.492
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME,
BLACK ROSE.

00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:05.662
WELCOME TO MY
HALL OF MIRRORS.

00:06:05.662 --> 00:06:09.466
I WAS HOPING WE COULD
REFLECT ON THE PAST.

00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:14.537
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

00:06:14.537 --> 00:06:15.538
HEY, AKIZA,
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:17.707
MINA!

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:20.009
LOOK OUT!

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.411
AAH!

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:25.915
HEY!
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:27.750
I AM, THANKS TO
YOUR HEADS UP.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.252
WHO ARE YOU?

00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:31.554
I'M WITH THE PUBLIC
SECURITY BUREAU. SEE?

00:06:31.554 --> 00:06:34.824
DIRECTOR GOODWIN SENT ME
HERE TO FIND MISS AKIZA.

00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:36.426
HE DID?

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:39.529
AND WHY DOES GOODWIN
WANT TO FIND AKIZA?

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:40.530
IT'S A NEED
TO KNOW THING.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.731
AND AS OF NOW,
GOODWIN DOESN'T THINK

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:44.234
I NEED TO KNOW.

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:46.336
YOU KNOW HOW GOODWIN IS,
TALKING ALL CRYPTIC,

00:06:46.336 --> 00:06:48.238
KEEPING EVERYONE
IN THE DARK.

00:06:48.238 --> 00:06:49.639
THAT'S GOODWIN.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.241
LET'S FIND AKIZA.

00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:52.609
PREPARE YOURSELF.

00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:56.913
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO FINISH WHAT WE
STARTED BEFORE.

00:06:56.913 --> 00:06:58.615
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL
THE PAIN THAT I'VE

00:06:58.615 --> 00:06:59.749
BEEN LIVING WITH.

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:01.184
I AM GONNA MAKE YOU PAY.

00:07:01.217 --> 00:07:04.187
THERE'S NO GOING
BACK, AKIZA.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.623
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO
SEAL THE CONTROL TOWER

00:07:06.623 --> 00:07:07.790
SO THAT YOU CAN PLAY
GOODIE-TWO-SHOES N' SAVE

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.660
THE WORLD, THEN YOU ARE
GONNA HAVE TO MAKE YOUR

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.661
WAY THROUGH
MY LITTLE MAZE.

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:13.596
HA HA HA!

00:07:13.596 --> 00:07:14.564
YOU DON'T
SCARE ME, MISTY.

00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:17.367
BRING IT!

00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:18.568
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:33.936
I'M GOING TO ENJOY
SENDING YOU

00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:36.605
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.340
LET'S DO THIS... AND
SINCE THIS IS

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.341
THE HALL OF MIRRORS,
I THINK I'LL PLAY

00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:42.611
THE MIRROR LABYRINTH
FIELD SPELL.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.482
AND WITH THAT ACTIVATED
I THINK IT'S TIME

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:47.916
TO REMINISCE.

00:07:47.916 --> 00:07:49.852
LET'S START BY OPENING
UP TO THE FIRST CHAPTER

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:54.957
OF MY SAD STORY...
SORROWFUL MEMORIES!

00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:57.593
WHOA, HOW DID YOU??

00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.396
Boy: HEY, YOU IN HERE, SIS??

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:02.231
I'M BACK FOR THE SUMMER!

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.333
Misty: TOBY!
CHECK IT OUT...

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.502
I GOT YOU
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:09.238
THANKS, BUT, UH... MY
BIRTHDAY WAS THREE
MONTHS AGO.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.073
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:13.742
YEAH. BUT I WAS
AWAY AT SCHOOL.

00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:16.078
SO, I MEAN... BETTER
LATE THAN NEVER, RIGHT?

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:17.346
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
TOBY, THANK YOU.

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.515
I'LL PUT A PICTURE
OF YOU IN IT

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:21.817
AND WEAR IT
EVERYWHERE I GO.

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:25.387
OH, SO, HEY,
GUESS WHAT?

00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:27.556
I WAS DOWN BY
THE PIER AND I SAW
SOMEONE DUELING.

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:28.557
SOMEONE
JUST LIKE ME.

00:08:28.557 --> 00:08:30.292
YOU MEAN SOMEONE
WITH YOUR POWERS?

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:32.461
SHE'S, LIKE,
REALLY AWESOME.

00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:34.496
HER NAME IS AKIZA.

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:36.332
SHE'S WITH THIS REALLY
COOL GROUP THAT CALLS

00:08:36.332 --> 00:08:39.501
THEMSELVES
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.037
I AM NOT LIKING
THE SOUND OF THIS.

00:08:42.037 --> 00:08:45.341
WHY NOT? WHY
SHOULDN'T I JOIN UP
WITH PEOPLE LIKE ME,

00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:47.076
PEOPLE WHO'D
UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT ME?

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:48.877
AS OPPOSED TO, LIKE,
MOM AND DAD WHO COULDN'T

00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:51.647
DEAL AND JUST
SENT ME AWAY.

00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:52.981
SO THAT'S HIM.

00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:54.550
THAT'S HER
LITTLE BROTHER.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.652
WITH SORROWFUL MEMORIES
IN PLAY, IF EITHER ONE

00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:59.121
OF US DRAWS A MONSTER CARD
DURING OUR DRAW PHASE,

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:00.656
WE'LL HAVE TO RETURN
THE CARD TO OUR DECK

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:02.558
AND THEN RESHUFFLE
THE WHOLE THING.

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:06.428
IN OTHER WORDS, ONE-THIRD
OF OUR DECK IS NOW SEALED

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:07.996
AWAY LIKE A BAD MEMORY.

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:10.699
WHAT ABOUT THE CARDS
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE
IN OUR HANDS?

00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:12.101
DO WE KEEP THOSE?

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:15.337
YES WE DO,
BUT BY SUMMONING
REPTILIANNE SERVANT

00:09:15.337 --> 00:09:17.639
IN ATTACK MODE SOME ARE
RENDERED USELESS.

00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:21.977
YOU SEE AS LONG AS
REPTILIANNE SERVANT

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:27.349
IS AROUND, NEITHER ONE OF
US CAN SUMMON A MONSTER
TO OUR FIELDS.

00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:29.518
ARE YOU FEELING
HELPLESS, YET?

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:30.819
WELL WELCOME
TO MY WORLD.

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:34.022
GLAD TO BE HERE!

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:35.023
A MONSTER CARD.

00:09:35.023 --> 00:09:37.359
THAT'S TOO BAD.

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:39.027
YOU'LL HAVE TO TUCK THAT
LITTLE GUY BACK INTO

00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:41.964
YOUR DECK AND THEN SHUFFLE
UP AND FORGET ABOUT IT.

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:50.005
GUESS I'LL END
MY TURN AND PLACE ONE
CARD FACEDOWN.

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:54.109
THEN FOLLOW ME, AKIZA,
DEEPER INTO THE LABYRINTH.

00:09:54.109 --> 00:09:57.446
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:04.520
ARE WE SURE AKIZA CAN
DEFEAT THIS DARK SIGNER?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.022
YEAH... HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN HER DUEL?

00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:10.292
NO, BUT I HEARD SHE WAS
TRAINED BY THE BEST.

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:12.261
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT SAYER?

00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:13.896
THAT GUY WAS A CREEP.

00:10:13.896 --> 00:10:16.899
I TAKE IT YOU HAVE
SPECIAL FEELINGS
FOR THIS GIRL.

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.868
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
RISK COMING TO SUCH
A DANGEROUS PLACE?

00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:22.004
SHE'S A FRIEND,
THAT'S ALL.

00:10:22.004 --> 00:10:23.472
LET'S KEEP WALKING.

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:25.774
HEY!
WHAT, WHAT IS IT?

00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:27.643
I SAW SOME MOVEMENT
IN THAT WINDOW!

00:10:27.643 --> 00:10:28.811
WHAT?

00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:32.648
AKIZA! MINA!

00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:34.683
HUH?

00:10:34.683 --> 00:10:36.585
MINA?

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:38.554
MINA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:41.356
MINA, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:43.926
OHH!

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:44.893
WHAT GIVES!?

00:10:44.893 --> 00:10:45.894
"JUST A FRIEND,"
HUH?

00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:47.796
AKIZA DOESN'T NEED
FRIENDS LIKE YOU

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:49.665
DRAGGING HER DOWN.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:50.799
YOU DID THIS?

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:54.603
THE ONLY PERSON AKIZA
NEEDS IN HER LIFE IS ME.

00:10:54.603 --> 00:10:58.440
I PLAY PSYCHIC SWORD!

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.875
NO WAY.

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:01.443
YES WAY.

00:11:01.443 --> 00:11:03.412
YOU'RE
A PSYCHIC DUELIST?!

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.714
YES, AND I CAN SEE
THAT YOUR FUTURE'S

00:11:05.714 --> 00:11:07.282
GONNA GET CUT SHORT.

00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:08.951
WHO ARE YOU?

00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:10.786
I'M THE LAST FACE
YOU'LL EVER SEE.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:14.356
HA HA HA!

00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:34.700
DON'T GET LOST, AKIZA.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.968
[THINKING]
WHAT KIND OF MIND GAMES

00:11:35.968 --> 00:11:39.605
ARE YOU TRYING TO PLAY
WITH ME, MISTY?

00:11:39.638 --> 00:11:41.173
MY TURN NOW.

00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:43.809
HA!

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:46.011
AND THE MEMORIES
JUST KEEP COMING.

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:49.448
I ACTIVATE THE NEXT CHAPTER
IN MY SAD STORY SPELL COMBO...

00:11:49.448 --> 00:11:52.718
UNWAVERING TRUTH.

00:11:52.718 --> 00:11:56.755
HEY, THIS IS
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT!

00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:59.925
Toby: MISS AKIZA!

00:11:59.925 --> 00:12:03.229
HI, UM, MY NAME
IS TOBY AND... AND I,
UM, I SAW YOU

00:12:03.229 --> 00:12:04.263
DUEL THE OTHER DAY.

00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:05.264
AND?

00:12:05.264 --> 00:12:07.166
AND I SORTA SPOKE
TO YOU AFTERWARDS

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.068
AND, UH, YOU MENTIONED
THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT,

00:12:09.068 --> 00:12:10.903
SO, UH...

00:12:10.903 --> 00:12:13.372
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE HERE TO
SEE WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT.

00:12:13.372 --> 00:12:14.773
GO BOTHER SAYER, KID.

00:12:14.773 --> 00:12:17.009
HE DEALS WITH
ALL THE NEWBIES.

00:12:19.778 --> 00:12:21.180
I WASN'T ME
BACK THEN.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.015
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE MEAN.

00:12:23.015 --> 00:12:24.016
Misty: THAT'S NOT WHY
I'M ANGRY.

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.385
WHAT THEN?

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:29.989
IN DUE TIME, BUT FIRST,
WITH UNWAVERING TRUTH
IN PLAY,

00:12:29.989 --> 00:12:32.224
IF EITHER ONE OF US
DRAWS A SPELL CARD

00:12:32.224 --> 00:12:33.225
DURING THE DRAW PHASE,
THEN IT'S BACK

00:12:33.225 --> 00:12:35.628
TO THE DECK
AND RESHUFFLE TIME,

00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:36.996
SO IF YOU WERE PLANNING
ON USING SPELLS,

00:12:36.996 --> 00:12:38.964
TOO BAD.

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.267
I THINK I SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:43.168
[THINKING]
SHE'S HOPING TO MAKE IT
SO THAT WE CAN'T SUMMON

00:12:43.168 --> 00:12:46.005
ANY MONSTERS OR PLAY ANY
SPELLS FROM OUR DECKS.

00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:50.376
BUT WHY WOULD SHE RISK
BACKING HERSELF INTO
A CORNER AS WELL?

00:12:50.376 --> 00:12:51.877
LET'S HAVE FUN...

00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:55.014
REPTILIANNE SERVANT,
SHATTER HER LIFE POINTS!

00:12:55.014 --> 00:12:56.849
HUH? UNH!

00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:09.261
THIS'LL TEACH YOU!

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:12.998
WHAT IS YOUR
PROBLEM, BUDDY?!

00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:15.034
WHY DON'T YOU WANT
ME TO HELP AKIZA?

00:13:15.034 --> 00:13:16.235
BECAUSE SHE
BELONGS TO ME!

00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:19.204
AND I WON'T LET YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE HER!

00:13:19.204 --> 00:13:21.206
OH, SO YOU'RE HER
NUMBER ONE FAN.

00:13:21.206 --> 00:13:22.441
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

00:13:22.441 --> 00:13:24.076
WELL I HATE TO BREAK
IT TO YA,

00:13:24.076 --> 00:13:27.146
BUT SHE'S A LITTLE
TOO BUSY TO SIGN
AUTOGRAPHS RIGHT NOW.

00:13:27.146 --> 00:13:28.147
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?!

00:13:28.147 --> 00:13:31.684
NOBODY MOCKS ME!

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.326
UNH! AAH!

00:13:40.326 --> 00:13:43.062
HA HA HA!

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:45.297
AKIZA IS DESTINED
FOR GREATNESS.

00:13:45.297 --> 00:13:47.866
SHE CAN'T BE WASTING
HER TIME WITH YOU.

00:13:54.406 --> 00:13:56.442
HEY, MINA, YOU OKAY?
TALK TO ME!

00:13:56.442 --> 00:14:00.245
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:14:00.245 --> 00:14:03.615
HOPE YOU CAN SWIM.

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:06.618
THIS IS BAD.

00:14:06.618 --> 00:14:09.688
LOOK HOW SCARED YOU
ARE WHEN THE WORST IS
YET TO COME.

00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:12.024
BECAUSE THE MIRROR
LABYRINTH FIELD SPELL IS

00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:13.859
IN PLAY AND BECAUSE
REPTILIANNE SERVANT IS

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:15.995
ALL BY HIS LONESOME
OUT THERE ON THE FIELD,

00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:21.600
IT CAN FOLLOW UP
THAT DIRECT ATTACK
WITH AN ENCORE!

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.270
REPTILIANNE SERVANT,
TAKE A BITE OUT OF HER
LIFE POINTS!

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:31.710
DON'T WORRY.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.845
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:36.181
I DON'T WANNA FINISH
YOU OFF TOO QUICKLY.

00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:39.284
IT'S YOUR MOVE, AKIZA.

00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:40.986
[THINKING]
I COULD SUMMON ONE
OF THESE MONSTERS

00:14:40.986 --> 00:14:43.155
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR REPTILIANNE
SERVANT.

00:14:43.155 --> 00:14:45.391
I'VE GOTTA GET THAT
SNAKE OFF THE FIELD.

00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:48.861
ALRIGHT, MISTY...
I DRAW!

00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:50.896
I'M PLACING THIS
CARD FACEDOWN,

00:14:50.896 --> 00:14:53.766
AND THAT'S THE
ONLY MOVE I'M
MAKING FOR NOW.

00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:56.702
WELL! SOMEBODY DREW
A TRAP CARD.

00:14:56.702 --> 00:14:58.704
THAT'S PRETTY FORTUNATE,
WOULDN'T YA SAY?

00:14:58.704 --> 00:15:01.206
FOLLOW ME IF YOU WANT
THE CHANCE TO PLAY IT.

00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:16.989
I HAVE TO WARN YOU
THIS NEXT PART IS
PRETTY EMOTIONAL.

00:15:16.989 --> 00:15:19.358
YOU SEE, EVERY SAD STORY
NEEDS A GUT-WRENCHING CLIMAX,

00:15:19.358 --> 00:15:22.027
FULL OF HEARTBREAK
AND LOSS.

00:15:22.027 --> 00:15:24.663
SO I'M ACTIVATING THE
ATROCIOUS DAY SPELL CARD

00:15:24.663 --> 00:15:26.698
FROM MY HAND.

00:15:28.834 --> 00:15:32.337
REMEMBER WHEN YOU LOST
CONTROL AND TORE UP
DOWNTOWN DOMINO?

00:15:32.337 --> 00:15:34.406
TOBY WENT TO SEE
YOU DUEL THAT DAY,

00:15:34.406 --> 00:15:39.278
AND I NEVER
SAW HIM AGAIN.

00:15:39.278 --> 00:15:41.413
SO YOU THINK THAT...

00:15:41.413 --> 00:15:43.148
THERE'S NO WAY.

00:15:43.148 --> 00:15:45.184
IT CAN'T BE, IT...

00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:47.186
THERE WERE NO
CASUALTIES THAT DAY,

00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:48.754
THE INVESTIGATION SAID!

00:15:48.754 --> 00:15:50.422
OH, RIGHT,
THE INVESTIGATION

00:15:50.422 --> 00:15:51.423
THAT WAS FUNDED
BY KICKBACKS N' BRIBES

00:15:51.423 --> 00:15:54.426
FROM THE ARCADIA MOVEMENT.

00:15:54.426 --> 00:15:56.161
I'M SURE THERE WASN'T
ANY COVER-UP THERE.

00:15:56.161 --> 00:15:57.396
NO. NO WAY.

00:15:57.396 --> 00:15:59.998
ACCEPT IT ALONG
WITH THE FACT

00:15:59.998 --> 00:16:03.402
THAT FROM THIS MOMENT ON
MY SAD STORY SPELL COMBO

00:16:03.402 --> 00:16:06.371
PREVENTS US FROM DRAWING
ANY NEW CARDS LIKE

00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:09.007
SOMEONE WHO'S LOST
SOMEONE THEY CARE ABOUT

00:16:09.007 --> 00:16:10.042
AND WHO CAN'T FIND
THE STRENGTH TO MOVE FORWARD

00:16:10.042 --> 00:16:11.777
WITHOUT THEM.

00:16:11.777 --> 00:16:14.379
ALL WE HAVE NOW IS
WHAT'S IN OUR HANDS.

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:16.582
SO SHOW ME, BLACK ROSE,
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING

00:16:16.582 --> 00:16:18.083
IN YOUR HAND?

00:16:18.083 --> 00:16:20.886
HEH HEH HEH.

00:16:20.886 --> 00:16:22.888
HA HA HA!

00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:39.211
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:16:39.211 --> 00:16:41.914
THERE WASN'T
A COVER-UP,

00:16:41.914 --> 00:16:44.517
AND I DIDN'T HURT
YOUR BROTHER.

00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:46.585
I'M GONNA SHOW
YOU THE TRUTH!

00:16:46.585 --> 00:16:48.220
AND I'LL START
BY ACTIVATING
ILLUSION DESTRUCTION!

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.923
THIS TRAP TAKES
A FACEUP CARD

00:16:50.923 --> 00:16:52.858
AND FLIPS IT
FACEDOWN.

00:16:56.195 --> 00:16:58.864
DID YOU KNOW
REPTILIANNE SERVANT
GETS DESTROYED

00:16:58.864 --> 00:17:01.500
WHENEVER IT'S THE TARGET
OF A SPELL OR A TRAP?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.169
OR IS THAT JUST
CLASSIC AKIZA...

00:17:03.169 --> 00:17:04.870
YOU DON'T KNOW
OR CARE WHO YOU HURT

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.273
WITH YOUR POWER.

00:17:07.273 --> 00:17:08.808
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER,

00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:11.043
BUT WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING HAPPENED
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

00:17:11.043 --> 00:17:14.180
YOU'RE JUST BELIEVING
WHAT YOU WANT
TO BELIEVE, MISTY,

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.983
AND THAT'S
'CAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME.

00:17:16.983 --> 00:17:18.818
YOU'RE THE ONE
IN DENIAL...

00:17:18.818 --> 00:17:20.186
YOU'RE LYING TO YOURSELF.

00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:21.520
NO I'M NOT!

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.022
AND NOW THE SAD
STORY ENDS

00:17:23.022 --> 00:17:25.558
WITH SORROWFUL CHAIN.

00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:30.429
STOP. I DON'T WANNA
SEE THIS ANYMORE.

00:17:30.463 --> 00:17:32.898
I COULDN'T DEAL
WITH LOSING MY
LITTLE BROTHER.

00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:35.067
I FELT SO
HELPLESS AND ALONE.

00:17:35.067 --> 00:17:36.268
AND THEN...

00:17:36.268 --> 00:17:38.037
AAH!

00:17:38.037 --> 00:17:41.874
THAT NIGHT, I WAS REBORN
AS A DARK SIGNER.

00:17:41.874 --> 00:17:43.976
AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOU.

00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.481
ANYONE!

00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:50.683
IS ANYONE UP THERE?!

00:17:50.683 --> 00:17:53.786
LOOKS LIKE A PUBLIC
SECURITY BUREAU ID.

00:17:53.786 --> 00:17:56.589
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

00:17:56.589 --> 00:17:58.891
OHH! THAT'S MINA'S ID!

00:17:58.891 --> 00:18:01.594
AND THAT'S
A JACK ATLAS STICKER!

00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:02.661
AAH!

00:18:02.661 --> 00:18:04.764
THAT'S IT, IT IS
ON, JACK ATLAS!!

00:18:04.764 --> 00:18:05.765
Mina: HELP!
SOMEONE, HELP US!

00:18:05.765 --> 00:18:09.402
MINA!

00:18:09.402 --> 00:18:11.037
I'M HERE, MINA!

00:18:11.037 --> 00:18:12.538
WHAT IF THIS
IS TRUE?

00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:14.440
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT SAYER
WOULD LIE TO ME,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.643
BUT IF IT'S TRUE,
IF I HURT HER BROTHER,

00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:19.845
WHO ELSE COULD
I HAVE HURT?

00:18:19.845 --> 00:18:22.114
OHH!

00:18:22.114 --> 00:18:24.116
AAH!

00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:25.918
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER.

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:28.120
WHO'RE YOU?

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.789
THE ONLY FRIEND
YOU'LL EVER NEED.

00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:31.157
YOUR VOICE.

00:18:31.157 --> 00:18:33.426
IT'S ME, AKIZA.

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.460
SAYER!

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.929
BUT... BUT WHEN
THE ARCADIA BUILDING

00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:38.697
WAS DESTROYED,
YOU...

00:18:38.697 --> 00:18:41.934
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOST
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:43.102
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:45.938
I MEAN... HOW ARE
YOU HERE RIGHT NOW?

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:46.972
GET BACK
ON YOUR FEET, AKIZA.

00:18:46.972 --> 00:18:49.442
I CAN'T DO THIS.

00:18:49.442 --> 00:18:50.643
LISTEN, AKIZA.

00:18:50.643 --> 00:18:52.611
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ME,
I COULD SENSE THAT

00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:54.980
YOUR TRUE POWER WAS TOO
MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.982
FEARING THAT YOU'D TAP
INTO IT BEFORE YOU WERE

00:18:56.982 --> 00:18:58.884
READY AND DESTROY
YOURSELF,

00:18:58.884 --> 00:19:01.687
I USED MY PSYCHIC ABILITIES
TO SEAL IT AWAY AND BURY IT

00:19:01.687 --> 00:19:03.956
DEEP INSIDE OF YOU,
BUT YOUR TRUE POWER

00:19:03.956 --> 00:19:06.592
CAN BE AWOKEN
WITH ONE LITTLE SENTENCE.

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:09.161
AKIZA, DID YOU HEAR?

00:19:09.161 --> 00:19:10.830
"THE ENTRANCE TO THE
NETHERWORLD WORLD IS

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.099
ON THE WITCH'S ISLAND."

00:19:16.068 --> 00:19:17.436
HA HA HA!

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.504
THAT'S IT, AKIZA.

00:19:18.504 --> 00:19:19.972
THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:21.841
THAT'S MY GIRL,
RIGHT THERE!

00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:24.543
NOW DUEL THIS PATHETIC
CRETIN AND SHOW THE WORLD

00:19:24.543 --> 00:19:25.945
YOUR REAL POWER!

00:19:25.945 --> 00:19:28.614
I HEAR YOU, MINA!

00:19:28.614 --> 00:19:29.949
WHERE ARE YOU?!

00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:31.150
Yusei: TRUDGE!
DOWN HERE!

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.151
HUH?

00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:33.219
OFFICER TRUDGE!

00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:37.456
OPEN THE HATCH, QUICK!

00:19:44.697 --> 00:19:46.132
ANY DAY NOW, TRUDGE.

00:19:46.132 --> 00:19:48.734
OH, EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY!

00:19:48.734 --> 00:19:51.137
YOU FINALLY REVEALED
YOUR TRUE SELF, THIS...

00:19:51.137 --> 00:19:53.072
JUST MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:19:53.072 --> 00:19:55.708
I ACTIVATE THE SORROWFUL
CHAIN TRAP CARD.

00:19:55.708 --> 00:19:57.710
SINCE SORROWFUL MEMORIES,
UNWAVERING TRUTH

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.813
AND ATROCIOUS DAY ARE ALL
GATHERED ON MY FIELD

00:20:00.813 --> 00:20:04.150
AS WELL, MY SAD LITTLE
STORY IS NOW COMPLETE.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.719
AND I NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO SUMMON DRAGON QUEEN

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:08.654
OF TRAGIC ENDINGS!

00:20:11.524 --> 00:20:13.926
Computer: DRAGON QUEEN OF TRAGIC
ENDINGS IS A LEVEL SIX

00:20:13.926 --> 00:20:17.129
DARK ATTRIBUTE MONSTER
WITH 1900 ATTACK POINTS

00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:20.766
AND 2600 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:20:20.766 --> 00:20:22.868
ARE YOU SMILING, AKIZA?

00:20:22.868 --> 00:20:25.838
WELL YOU WON'T BE
AFTER THIS NEXT ATTACK!

00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:29.775
DRAGON QUEEN OF TRAGIC
ENDINGS, BLOW AWAY
AKIZA'S LIFE POINTS!

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:32.478
GO, TRAGEDY STREAM!

00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:37.950
AND NOW, SINCE YOU
TOOK BATTLE DAMAGE,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.119
ONE OF DRAGON QUEEN
OF TRAGIC ENDINGS'

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:41.954
SPECIAL ABILITIES
WILL BE KICKING IN.

00:20:41.954 --> 00:20:43.055
YOU HAVE TO SELECT A CARD
IN YOUR HAND AND SEND IT

00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:45.090
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.026
TIME TO WAVE BYE-BYE.

00:20:47.026 --> 00:20:48.093
YEAH, FINE,
WHATEVER.

00:20:48.093 --> 00:20:51.564
TAKE HEDGE GUARD.

00:20:51.564 --> 00:20:55.201
AND NOW, THANKS TO
ANOTHER ONE OF DRAGON
QUEEN'S ABILITIES,

00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:57.703
I'M ABLE
TO DRAW ANOTHER CARD.

00:20:57.703 --> 00:20:59.538
SINCE THIS ISN'T
THE DRAW PHASE,

00:20:59.538 --> 00:21:02.575
SAD STORY HAS NO EFFECT,
SO I'LL BE HANGING
ON TO THIS ONE.

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:04.043
I END MY TURN.

00:21:04.043 --> 00:21:06.879
MY MOVE THEN.
I DRAW.

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:08.414
NOT THAT IT MATTERS
WHAT IT IS SINCE

00:21:08.414 --> 00:21:09.682
I'VE GOTTA
DISCARD IT.

00:21:09.682 --> 00:21:12.084
AND HONESTLY, NOT
THAT I CARE EITHER.

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:13.619
AFTER ALL, I'M ABOUT
TO SUMMON WITCH

00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:16.622
OF THE BLACK ROSE
FROM MY HAND.

00:21:16.622 --> 00:21:19.959
AND SINCE THIS MONSTER
WAS SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED,

00:21:19.959 --> 00:21:21.660
I'M ABLE TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.730
BUT IF THE CARD I DRAW
IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.434
A MONSTER CARD,
WITCH OF THE BLACK
ROSE'LL DESTROY IT.

00:21:28.434 --> 00:21:30.202
BUT IF IT IS
A MONSTER CARD,

00:21:30.202 --> 00:21:31.437
THIS ISN'T
THE DRAW PHASE,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.939
SO YOUR SAD STORY
WILL HAVE NO EFFECT.

00:21:33.939 --> 00:21:36.575
TWO CAN PLAY
AT THIS GAME, MISTY.

00:21:40.512 --> 00:21:41.914
GOT IT!

00:21:41.914 --> 00:21:43.983
THIS IS ROSE FAIRY,
AND WHEN ROSE FAIRY

00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:46.485
MOVES FROM MY DECK
TO MY HAND
'CAUSE OF AN EFFECT,

00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:49.855
I CAN INSTANTLY
SUMMON IT!

00:21:49.855 --> 00:21:51.490
AND NOW WITCH
OF THE BLACK ROSE

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.592
GIVES ROSE FAIRY
A LITTLE TUNE-UP!

00:21:53.592 --> 00:21:56.061
I'M DONE LISTENING

00:21:56.061 --> 00:22:00.599

WHAT'S THAT?!

00:22:10.709 --> 00:22:12.011
AAH! AAH!

00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:14.179
[GROANING]

00:22:23.188 --> 00:22:27.192
YOU PICKED THE WRONG
GIRL TO HOLD A GRUDGE
AGAINST, MISTY.

00:22:29.762 --> 00:22:32.831
GOOD, AKIZA. DESTROY
EVERYONE IN YOUR WAY,

00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:34.600
AND THEN SOON, YOU
AND I ARE GOING TO REVIVE

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.104

[GROWLING]
