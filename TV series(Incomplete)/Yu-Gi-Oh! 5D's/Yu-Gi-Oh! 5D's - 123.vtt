00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.783
SORRY.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:47.153
YOUR FATHER SEEMED
TO THINK OTHERWISE.

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:51.057
HE VERY MUCH WANTED
YOU TO HAVE IT.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.931
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME THAT YOU
LOST YOUR HEART, DRAGAN.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:58.965
WELL, FRIEND...

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.801
IF YOU BATTLE ALONGSIDE
ME WITH THOR,

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.636
I THINK YOU JUST MIGHT FIND IT.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:06.639
I CAN'T TAKE ON THE
COMING THREAT ALONE.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.110
TO BE VICTORIOUS,
I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.279
AND THAT OF ONE OTHER.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:21.221
Broder: YOU SURE PICKED A
WAY OUTTA THE WAY PLACE

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.455
TO LOOK FOR TREASURE.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.657
AND NOT TO MENTION
DANGEROUS, TOO!

00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:25.758
I DON'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU,

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:28.561
BUT THERE ARE PIRATES
ALL AROUND THESE PARTS.

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:33.233
IN FACT, SOME SAY THIS
ENTIRE AREA'S HAUNTED.

00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:35.368
SO THAT BEING THE CASE,
I'M SURE THAT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.538
IF I JUST WAIT HERE.

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.000
THERE IT IS.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.068
THE THIRD OF THE
NORDIC GOD CARDS,

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:12.272
THE ELUSIVE LOKI,
LORD OF THE AESIR CARD!

00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:13.439
HIYA!

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.913
ON SECOND THOUGHT, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE PIRATES OR GHOSTS.

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:23.082
IF THERE'S ANYONE YOU'RE GONNA
WORRY ABOUT, IT SHOULD BE ME.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.117
LATER, GATOR.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.052
HMM...

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:29.022
THAT WAS TOO EASY!

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.190
UH...

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.199
LOOKS LIKE HE BROUGHT BACKUP.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.967
TOO BAD THEY'RE NOT
GONNA DO HIM ANY GOOD.

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:43.469
AFTER ALL, IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THESE HERE WATERS,

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.637
YOU'RE WRECKED.

00:11:45.939 --> 00:11:49.175
DRAGAN, THESE ROCKS ARE
POSING QUITE THE PROBLEM.

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.543
SEE TO IT.

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:57.550
HOW IN THE WORLD...?

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.618
AH!

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:01.221
OH, NO!

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.822
I'M WRECKED!

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.897

[GROANING]

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:29.015
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:30.516
BUT NO HARM, NO FOUL.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:32.218
HERE'S YOUR CARD.

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:34.320
THAT IS NOT JUST ANY CARD.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.889
THAT IS ONE OF THE
THREE NORDIC GOD CARDS.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.926
IT IS KNOWN AS LOKI, LORD OF
THE AESIR, AND IT'S NOT OURS.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:41.060
IT'S YOURS.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.063
MINE?

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.298
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.700
NONE OF THIS IS
AN ACCIDENT, BRODER.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.702
AFTER ALL, WHY DO YOU
THINK I ASKED YOU

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.471
TO HELP ME TRACK THAT CARD DOWN?

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.106
YOU WERE DESTINED TO HAVE IT,

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.975
SO THAT YOU COULD HELP US NOW.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.644
HOW CAN I HELP?

00:12:57.644 --> 00:12:59.445
I'M NO ONE.

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.214
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES.

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:04.317
AND NOW THAT THE THREE NORDIC
GODS HAVE BEEN PLACED,

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:07.620
THEY SHALL, AT LONG LAST,
BE RESURRECTED!

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:10.323

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:12.792
WAIT, WHAT'S HAPPENIN' HERE?

00:13:15.028 --> 00:13:20.233
Halldor: WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
SO THAT THE WORLD CAN BE SAVED.

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:43.523
Halldor: THEY SAY
THE THREE NORDIC GODS

00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:46.826
HAVE THE POWER TO FEND OFF
THE GRAVEST OF THREATS.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.796
SO WE ARE GOING TO USE THAT
POWER AGAINST THE THREAT

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:51.564
THAT IS NOW FAST APPROACHING.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.033
AFTER ALL, THIS IS OUR DUTY.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:56.069
Yusei: WE'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT THE EMPERORS, RIGHT?

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.637
THAT IS CORRECT, YUSEI.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:59.906
THEY HOLD THE KEY
TO EVERYTHING.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:01.641
WHICH IS WHY WE MUST FACE THEM,

00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:05.511
BECAUSE ONLY THEN WILL THE FULL
SCOPE OF THEIR PLAN BE REVEALED.

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:07.213
SO TAKING ON
TEAM NEW WORLD

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.948
IS WHY YOU ENTERED
THIS WHOLE THING?

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.351
LISTEN GUYS, WE WANNA
TAKE THEM DOWN TOO.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.586
WE SHOULD ALL JUST
WORK TOGETHER.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:17.690
SORRY, BUT I'M AFRAID
THE THREE NORDIC GOD CARDS

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.760
DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE AN
ALLY WORTH HAVING, YUSEI.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.095
WHAT?

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:24.364
THE PERSON WHOSE RESEARCH
BROUGHT ABOUT ZERO REVERSE

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:27.900
WAS YOUR FATHER,
WAS IT NOT, YUSEI?

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.902
AND SINCE YOU'RE
OF HIS BLOODLINE,

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:33.740
YOU HAVE IT IN YOU TO CAUSE THE
SAME DAMAGE HIS RESEARCH DID.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.108
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:37.443
AND MY FATHER WAS
A VERY GOOD MAN.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:40.213
SO YOU SAY, BUT I SUPPOSE
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO LET

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:42.115
OUR UPCOMING DUEL
REVEAL WHAT'S WHAT.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:44.884
JUST FORGET ABOUT
THESE THREE BOZOS, YUSEI.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.120
IT'S NOT LIKE WE
NEED THEIR HELP ANYHOW.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.556
AH, JACK, I SEE YOUR DIVA
ATTITUDE HASN'T CHANGED.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.758
MY WHAT?

00:14:51.758 --> 00:14:53.192
YOU HEARD ME.

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.461
YOU'RE SO ARROGANT,
I'LL BET YOU STILL THINK

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.730
YOU REALLY WON
BACK WHEN WE DUELED.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.365
WE DUELED?

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:01.267
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:02.902
I COULDN'T BE MORE SURE.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.638
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE REASON
I LOST HEART IN DUELING.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.106
I AM?

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:10.076
YES, IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO...

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.779
WHEN ONE MORNING I WOKE
AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:16.349
FOR ME TO LEAVE HOME AND
MAKE MY NAME AS A DUELIST.

00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:19.852
HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I WOULD NEED TO FIND A CARD

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:23.322
THAT WAS AS STRONG AS MY
COMPETITIVE INSTINCTS.

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:25.825
I SOON FOUND WHAT
I WAS LOOKING FOR:

00:15:25.825 --> 00:15:29.395
ONE OF THE THREE NORDIC
GOD CARDS THOR.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.264
MY FATHER WAS THERE WITH ME.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:35.735
HE SAW THE CONNECTION
I FELT TO THOR.

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.271
AND HE SAW THOR'S MIGHT.

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:45.678
MY FATHER WAS BADLY INJURED
WHEN THE CAVE COLLAPSED.

00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:49.015
BUT LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE
TO GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:51.818
HOWEVER, THE OPERATIONS
THAT MY FATHER NEEDED

00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:53.719
TO GET BETTER WEREN'T CHEAP.

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:55.688
AND UNFORTUNATELY,

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.757
WE HAD NO MONEY.

00:15:57.757 --> 00:15:59.258
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:01.260
UNTIL AN OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTED ITSELF.

MM-HMM.

Dragan: I COULDN'T REFUSE.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.405
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:14.574
WHY I WAS SELECTED
TO BE YOUR OPPONENT.

00:16:14.574 --> 00:16:16.809
BACK THEN, YOU
WERE A DUELING STAR.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:17.944
THIS WAY, MR. ATLAS.

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:25.017

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:26.719
THEY WANTED ME TO
BE YOUR OPPONENT

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.621
BECAUSE YOU WERE A STAR.

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:30.356
SEE, I WAS A NOBODY.

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.458
THEY FIGURED I WOULD
DO WHAT I WAS TOLD.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:34.994
ESPECIALLY IF THE
PRICE WAS RIGHT.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:39.031
AND WHAT I WAS TOLD
WAS TO LOSE THE MATCH.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:41.400

AGAINST EVERY INSTINCT

BUT WITH MY FATHER'S
WELL-BEING ON THE LINE,

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.306
I HAD TO REJECT THOSE INSTINCTS.

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:50.343
I HAD TO ACCEPT THE
INSTRUCTIONS THAT LAZAR GAVE ME

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.112
AND THROW THE MATCH.

WANTED TO KEEP MAKING MONEY.

TOO PUMPED UP TO NOTICE.

TO USE ANY OF THEM.

TO SEE, AFTER ALL.

YOU WERE SHOWBOATING.

HOW YOU WERE SO FULL
OF FALSE CONFIDENCE.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.524

<i>IF YOU DON'T LOSE THE MATCH,</i>
<i>YOU DON'T GET THE MONEY.</i>

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.646
<i>AND YOU DON'T SAVE YOUR FATHER.</i>

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.549
[DRAGAN GROANING]

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.786
TAKE HEART, MY LITTLE,
AMATEUR, DUELING FRIEND.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:48.487
RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND AND I

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.890
ARE ABOUT TO PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY!

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.726
GO ABSOLUTE POWERFORCE!

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:59.899
[GROANING]

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:05.004
Draga: I LOST THE MATCH.

00:20:05.004 --> 00:20:07.673
BUT I WON MY FATHER'S HEALTH.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:09.975
I NEVER REGRETTED WHAT I DID.

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.277
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

00:20:11.277 --> 00:20:15.514
I NEVER STOPPED THINKING
ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN.

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:20.152
OH, PLEASE.

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.654
YOU'RE JUST SORE.

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:23.289
I'LL BET YOU CREATED
THAT WHOLE STORY

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:25.458
JUST TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:28.094
THE TRUTH IS, THOUGH,
YOU LOST FAIR AND SQUARE.

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.829
NO, JACK, THE TRUTH IS...

00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:32.832
IF I HAD USED MY TRUMP CARD,
I WOULD'VE WON THE MATCH.

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:34.500
YOU'RE OFF YOUR ROCKER!

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.935
ENOUGH SMALL TALK.

00:20:35.935 --> 00:20:38.471
WE CAN SETTLE THIS
MATTER ANOTHER WAY.

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:40.706
YEAH, WITH A REMATCH.

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:43.442
SO SINCE WE HAVE TO DUEL
FOR THE GRAND PRIX ANYHOW,

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:46.112
THIS SHOULD MAKE
THINGS EXTRA INTERESTING.

00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:57.490
THEN IT'S SETTLED.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.760
TOMORROW WE DUEL TO SETTLE
THINGS BETWEEN JACK AND DRAGAN.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.294
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:04.330
TO SEE WHICH OF OUR
TEAMS GETS TO ADVANCE

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.265
TO THE GRAND PRIX FINALS.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.834
WHERE WE'LL HAVE THE CHANCE
TO TAKE ON THE REAL VILLAIN.

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.536
SO YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE,

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:12.571
WE'RE GONNA REV IT UP!
