LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:34.407
HUH. OKAY,
THAT WAS FAST.

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:39.179
LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE
GOING FIRST, GENTLEMEN.

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.952
THIS IS IT, KALIN.
YOU READY?

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:47.487
OF COURSE.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:49.522
AND WHEN THE DUST SETTLES...

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:52.192
WE'LL BE
THE LAST MEN STANDING.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:11.010
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.180
I SUMMON GATLING OGRE
TO THE FIELD!

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:20.186
AND WITH THAT DONE...

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.789
VICTORY WILL SOON BE MINE.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:25.658
SEE, THANKS TO GATLING OGRE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.794
FOR EVERY FACEDOWN SPELL
OR TRAP CARD

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.562
THAT I SEND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:33.066
ONE OF YOU WILL GET SERVED
WITH 800 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.601
[THINKING]
AND WITH 10 CARDS,

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:35.702
HE CAN TAKE US
BOTH OUT.

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:37.737
HOWEVER,
BY ACTIVATING
THIS CARD,

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.240
I CAN SHUT
GATLING OGRE DOWN.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.242
DON'T MAKE A MOVE, YUSEI.

00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:43.676
HUH?

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.180
BRING IT ON.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.748
REALLY NOW?

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.483
THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE
TO STOP ME.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:54.420
GOIN' ONCE...
GOIN' TWICE...

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.855
ALRIGHT, IF YOU WANT IT...

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.490
I'LL GIVE IT TO YA'!

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.825
AH!

00:10:58.825 --> 00:10:59.926
PLAY SOMETHING!

00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.895
WHAT'S HE DOING?
THIS LOOKS BAD!

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:02.896
HMM.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:06.666
AH! UH!

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.540
KALIN, NO!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.641
NO WAY.

00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:16.042
HE LOST ALREADY?

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:18.511
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:23.149
NOW THAT WAS EASIER THAN
STEALIN' CANDY FROM A BABY.

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.752
NOW...AS FOR--WHA...

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:27.053
[COLLECTIVE GASP]

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.329
ARE YOU GUYS
SEEING THIS?

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.131
HOW IS HE STANDING!?

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:39.899
Lawton: WHAT IS THIS?

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.068
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?...

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:43.169
YOU'RE DONE!

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.572
NOW LIE DOWN
LIKE THE LOSER YOU ARE!

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.473
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:49.909
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN THAT
GATLING OGRE OF YOURS

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.444
TO KEEP ME DOWN...

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.080
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
A FRIEND OF MINE.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.221
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS THAT THING?

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.022
WHEN MY LIFE POINTS
BECOME ZERO

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.691
DUE TO DAMAGE
FROM AN EFFECT...

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.493
I CAN SUMMON INFERNITY ZERO
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.163
BY DISCARDING EVERY OTHER CARD
IN MY HAND.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:13.333
AND WITH INFERNITY ZERO
ON MY FIELD, I CAN'T LOSE...

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.636
EVEN IF MY LIFE POINTS
DROP ALL THE WAY TO ZERO.

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:19.305
BUT FOR EVERY 500 POINTS
OF DAMAGE I TAKE,

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.107
I GAIN A DOOM COUNTER.

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:22.709
AND WHEN I'VE GOT
3 DOOM COUNTERS,

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.310
INFERNITY ZERO
IS DESTROYED.

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.311
AND THEN SO AM I.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.779
YOU MEAN YOU--

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.882
YOU CAN KEEP ON DUELING
AFTER I'VE BEATEN YOU!?

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.217
HE'S SO AWESOME.

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:35.154
[SNICKERING]

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.557
YOU ARE ONE
CREEPY LITTLE PUNK...

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:39.392
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:40.860
MAYBE.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.162
BUT THIS
CREEPY LITTLE PUNK

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:45.164
IS GONNA BE THE END
OF YOU, LAWTON.

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:47.166
WE'LL JUST SEE ABOUT THAT.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:49.302
I STILL HAVE PLENTY
OF POWER LEFT.

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:51.471
JUST YOU WATCH!

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.909
KALIN! THIS'LL PUT
YOU DOWN FOR GOOD.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:58.811
AH!
FINISH HIM!

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.246
NOT SO FAST!

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:03.016
I CAN TAKE
INFERNITY DOOM SLINGER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:13:03.016 --> 00:13:06.586
AND REMOVE IT ENTIRELY
FROM PLAY TO NEGATE
YOUR ATTACK.

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:09.055
AS FOR WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER THAT, WELL...

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.591
THAT'S ENTIRELY UP
TO YOU, LAWTON.

00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.927
I'M GONNA DRAW
THE TOP CARD ON MY DECK,

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:16.829
AND IF THIS CARD ENDS UP
BEING A MONSTER CARD,

00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:20.300
YOU'LL GET SLAMMED WITH
4,800 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.003
AND I'M AFRAID THAT'S
GOING TO BE ALL SHE
WROTE FOR YOU, LAWTON.

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:26.639
HOWEVER, IF THIS CARD
ISN'T A MONSTER CARD,

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.075
THEN I TAKE 4,000
POINTS OF DAMAGE,

00:13:29.075 --> 00:13:31.110
WHICH WOULD SLAP ME
WITH 3 DOOM COUNTERS

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.745
REQUIRED TO
FINISH ME OFF.

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.447
OR YOU COULD CHOOSE
NOT TO RISK IT,

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:37.383
IN WHICH CASE YOU CAN'T
DISH OUT ANY MORE DAMAGE
THIS TURN.

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:40.086
SO...WHAT'LL IT BE?

00:13:40.086 --> 00:13:42.789
[THINKING]
HE CAN'T ATTACK
ON HIS FIRST TURN...

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:46.092
SO THERE'S NO REASON
FOR ME TO FLIRT WITH
AN ALL-OR-NOTHING RISK.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.027
I'M GONNA END MY TURN.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:51.030
WHAT'S WRONG, LAWTON?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD GUTS.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.498
I DO HAVE GUTS.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.734
BUT YOU SEE, I'VE ALSO
GOT BRAINS, KALIN.

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:57.236
I STOOD TO LOSE MORE
THAN I STOOD TO GAIN.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:14:00.139
IF YOU SAY SO.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:02.709
[THINKING]
WHAT IS THAT CARD?

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.143
WHAT DID HE DRAW?

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.279
THAT WAS A BAD CALL.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:09.649
I PLACE ONE CARD
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN.

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:11.718
[THINKING]
SO IT WASN'T A MONSTER CARD.

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:14.087
IF I'D TAKEN THE CHANCE,
I WOULDA HAD HIM.

00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:15.588
IT'S MY TURN!

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:19.826
I SUMMON JUSTICE
BRINGER TO THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.796
Duel Runner Computer:
DURING YOUR OPPONENT'S TURN,

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.332
JUSTICE BRINGER NEGATES
THE SPECIAL ABILITIES

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:29.602
OF YOUR OPPONENT'S
SPECIAL SUMMONED MONSTERS.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.604
[THINKING]
NOW, ON LAWTON'S
NEXT TURN,

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.741
I CAN SEAL AWAY
GATLING OGRE BY
USING THIS TRAP.

00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:39.979
I KNOW YOU'RE SITTIN' ON
THE EFFECT VEILER TRAP CARD!

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:43.182
WHICH IS WHY I'M ACTIVATIN'
A TRAP CARD OF MY OWN.

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:45.051
PINPOINT SHOT!

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.121
BY CORRECTLY GUESSING A CARD
THAT'S IN YOUR HAND,

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.123
I SEND THAT CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.228
I PLACE ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:56.629
[THINKING]
THIS GUY'S SMART,

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.331
AND HE KNOWS
HOW TO ADAPT.

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.500
IF WE DON'T FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO GET
AHEAD OF HIM,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.368
HE'S GONNA FINISH US.

00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:20.386
IT'S MY TURN! YEAH!

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:24.824
FIRST, I'M PUTTING
GATLING OGRE IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:27.860
NEXT, I'M ACTIVATING
AN EQUIP SPELL FROM MY HAND--

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.862
DOUBLE ARMS!

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:38.237
NOW GATLING OGRE
CAN DOLE OUT

00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:40.673
TWICE AS MUCH DAMAGE
AS IT COULD BEFORE.

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:43.676
SO WE'RE TALKING
1,600 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.978
I AM NOT LIKING
THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.281
I WOULDN'T WORRY, YUSEI,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:49.715
HE'S AFTER ME.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.584
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:53.419
IT'S OVER FOR YOU, KALIN!

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:55.154
NOW FINISH HIM!

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:58.257
I REVEAL THE DODGE
ROLL TRAP CARD!

00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:01.494
THIS CARD PROTECTS ME FROM
DAMAGE FOR ONE TIME ONLY.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:04.096
GOOD THING I CAN'T
JUST ATTACK ONE TIME ONLY!

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.598
GO!

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:07.033
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP!

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.435
HALF SHIELD!

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:12.839
THIS TRAP CUTS DAMAGE
FROM ONE OF YOUR
MONSTERS IN HALF!

00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:23.983
A DOOM COUNTER.
JUST ONE, THOUGH.

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.651
HA HA!
I GOTTA SAY,

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.653
FOR SOMEONE WHO GAVE UP
LIVING THEIR DREAMS,

00:16:27.653 --> 00:16:30.423
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
TO GIVE UP ON A DUEL.

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:32.425
YOU'RE HOLDING ON WITH
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:34.560
BUT YOU CAN'T HOLD ON
FOREVER.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.362
HMPH!
YEAH...

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:38.564
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.900
SO WHY NOT GO AHEAD
AND FINISH ME OFF?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.236
HUH?
YOU CAN, RIGHT?

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:46.172
SO GO ON, DO IT.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.040
[THINKING]
I'VE ONLY GOT ENOUGH
RIGHT NOW

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.109
TO GIVE HIM ONE MORE
DOOM COUNTER.

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:53.246
I MIGHT AS WELL,
BUT...AH.

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:56.349
C'MON, LAWTON.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.785
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
ATTACK.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.754
[THINKING]
IS KALIN LEAVING
EVERYTHING

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:03.022
UP TO FATE AGAIN?

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:04.257
OR IS HE
BAITING HIM?

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:07.326
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING
FOR, TOUGH GUY?

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:08.828
LET ME HAVE IT.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.264
[THINKING]
I KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:15.468
HE'S TRYING TO SUCKER ME
INTO RUNNIN' OUT OF MY AMMO.

00:17:15.468 --> 00:17:17.670
FORGET IT.
I END MY TURN.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.339
IT'S YOUR MOVE, KALIN.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.974
HEY, UH...

00:17:21.974 --> 00:17:24.777
YOU DID EXPECT ME
TO USE HALF SHIELD
JUST NOW, DIDN'T YOU?

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:27.680
YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO LOSE ON PURPOSE,
ARE YOU?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.215
OF COURSE I'M NOT.

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:30.716
I'VE GOT WAY TOO MUCH
TO FIGHT FOR

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.652
TO JUST ROLL OVER,
YUSEI.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.556
THE SORROW AND PAIN OF THOSE
I SENT TO THE MINES,

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:40.259
THE PROMISE I MADE TO THE FATHER
OF THOSE KIDS.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.830
WHEN I CONVINCED MYSELF
THAT YOU BETRAYED ME, YUSEI...

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.034
I LET MYSELF
GO OFF THE DEEP END.

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:50.503
I BECAME SELF-ABSORBED,
THINKING ONLY OF ME.

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:53.072
LIVING AND DUELING
ONLY FOR ME.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.308
I DIDN'T CARE WHO I HURT.

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:58.077
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,
WHEN YOU DEFEATED ME,

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:01.180
I SAW WHAT I HAD BECOME.
I WAS SO LOST.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.583
I JUST....
I GAVE UP.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.384
BUT I GET IT NOW.

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:08.354
I WAS LOOKING WITHIN, TRYING TO
FIND SOMETHING WORTH SAVING,

00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:10.990
BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME
TO LOOK OUT, TO HELP OTHERS.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.692
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:14.594
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT MYSELF.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:17.029
BUT BY LETTING MYSELF
CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE,

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.798
I HAVE FOUND A NEW PURPOSE.

00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:21.601
AND I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO FIGHT FOR!

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.369
LET'S DO THIS!

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:28.574
I SUMMON INFERNITY ARCHFIEND
TO THE FIELD IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:30.576
WHEN I DRAW
THIS MONSTER CARD

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.011
AND I'VE GOT NO OTHER CARDS
IN MY HAND,

00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:34.080
I CAN INSTANTLY SUMMON IT.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.015
AND WHEN IT'S BEEN
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED

00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:38.217
AND I'M ONCE AGAIN
HOLDING NO CARDS,

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:41.887
I CAN ADD ONE INFERNITY MONSTER
FROM MY DECK TO MY HAND.

00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:46.058
SO NOW I SUMMON THE MONSTER CARD
INFERNITY MIRAGE TO THE FIELD.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.029
MY HAND IS EMPTY AGAIN,

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:52.498
WHICH MEANS I CAN RELEASE
INFERNITY MIRAGE

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.933
AND SUMMON TWO
INFERNITY MONSTERS

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:55.835
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:58.004
SO I'M SUMMONING
INFERNITY BEETLE

00:18:58.004 --> 00:19:00.606
AND INFERNITY BEAST
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:03.042
NOW, I ACTIVATE
MY BEETLE'S ABILITY!

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.645
BY SACRIFICING
ONE INFERNITY BEETLE,

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.713
I CAN SUMMON
TWO MORE INFERNITY BEETLES

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:10.750
FROM MY DECK, HAND,
OR GRAVEYARD.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.492
PRETTY GOOD.

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.961
I MAY'VE UNDERESTIMATED
THIS PUNK.

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:23.562
GREAT JOB, KALIN!

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:25.197
IF ALL THOSE
ATTACKS SUCCEED,

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:26.532
THIS DUEL IS OURS!

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:29.535
LAWTON, YOU--
YOU BETTER NOT LET
THOSE BOYS BEAT YOU!

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:32.338
IS IT BAD THAT I LIKE
SEEING HER GET SO UPSET?

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:33.606
NOT AT ALL.

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:36.008
NOW I'LL USE
INFERNITY BEETLE NUMBER 1

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.643
TO ATTACK GATLING OGRE!

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:41.781
NOT SO FAST, I REVEAL
THE BACK ATTACK AMBUSH TRAP!

00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:45.451
AND WITH THIS IN PLAY,
THE BATTLE PHASE ENDS,

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:49.722
AND THEN FOR EVERY MONSTER
YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE,

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:53.359
I CAN SUMMON
AN AMBUSH TOKEN TO MY FIELD.

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.895
AND HERE'S THE THING
I JUST LOVE ABOUT
AMBUSH TOKENS--

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.963
FOR EVERY ONE
THAT I RELEASE,

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.866
GUESS WHO'S GONNA TAKE
500 POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:01.934
YOU!

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.969
THAT'LL GIVE HIM
3 DOOM COUNTERS.

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.204
HE'LL BE OUT OF THE DUEL.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.706
OH, NO!

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:08.307
YOU SHOW 'EM HOW IT'S DONE,
SWEETIE-PIE!

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:09.675
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:13.612
PUNKS LIKE YOU DON'T GET TO
TAKE DOWN MEN LIKE ME, KALIN.

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:18.017
MEN LIKE ME EAT PUNKS
LIKE YOU FOR BREAKFAST!

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:22.254
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:25.524
I ACTIVATE
JUSTICE BRINGER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:30.763
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR AMBUSH TOKEN'S

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:34.400
AREN'T GOING TO BE
AMBUSHING ANYONE'S
LIFE POINTS NOW.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.336
YOU'RE GOING TO PAY
FOR THAT.

00:20:37.336 --> 00:20:39.238
HA HA!
HE SAVED HIM.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:40.673
GO, YUSEI!

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:42.108
GRR...

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:44.510
THANKS, PAL.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.045
NICE TRY, LAWTON.

00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:49.648
BUT KALIN AND I
ARE TAKING YOU OUT.
