00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.035
Crow: DID THAT
COOLING ROD WORK?

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:03.403
WE IN BUSINESS?

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:04.938
YUP.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.007
THANKS FOR
TRACKING IT DOWN.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.510
Akiza: TRACKING WHAT DOWN?

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:11.778
Crow: LOOKIN' GOOD!

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.581
Jack: YOU ALMOST LOOK LIKE
A TURBO DUELIST.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.584
IS THAT WHAT
I THINK IT IS?

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.020
THIS IS YOUR
MEMBERSHIP CARD.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.856
Akiza: SO I WANNA
JOIN THE CLUB.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:24.157
I WANT A PIECE
OF THE ACTION.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.325
I WANNA SPEAK
YOUR LANGUAGE.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:29.129
I JUST--I WANNA BE A PART
OF YOUR WORLD, YUSEI.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:30.731
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.201
I WANNA BECOME
A TURBO DUELIST.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:36.303
WE BUILT THIS
BAD BOY

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.638
USING PARTS WE
SCRAPED TOGETHER

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.706
FROM A COUPLE
OF SCRAP YARDS.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:41.441
IT'S NO ZX-2200,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:42.576
BUT IT'LL TREAT YOU
GOOD ENOUGH,

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.345
FOR NOW.

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.548
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY, FELLAS.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.883

Teacher: WELL, ENROLLMENT
CERTAINLY HAS GONE UP

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.585
SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF THE GRAND PRIX.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.021
I USED TO TEACH THIS
CLASS IN THE BASEMENT.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.790
QUICK WARNING FOR ALL YOU
DREAMERS OUT THERE, THOUGH--

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:05.359
GETTING YOUR TURBO
LICENSE IS HARD.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.695
QUALIFYING FOR THE GRAND
PRIX IS EVEN HARDER.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.097
Leo: SO DOES THIS
MEAN YOU'RE GONNA
BE TAKING

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:11.965
THE GRAND
PRIX BY STORM?

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:13.033
LEO!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.568
LUNA!

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:17.504
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF
OURSELVES OR ANYTHING.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.540
I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT
THE GRAND PRIX RIGHT NOW.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:24.077
I'M JUST HOPING I CAN
QUALIFY FOR A LICENSE.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.979
DON'T WORRY, AKIZA,
YOU'RE GONNA
BE GREAT.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.948
Student: EXCUSE ME, BUT, UM,
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:29.383
IN THE RIGHT PLACE?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.617
YEAH, SHOULDN'T YOU
BE AT HOME,

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:31.918
PLAYING
WITH YOUR DOLLS?

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:32.986
OR PRETENDING
TO COOK

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:34.855
IN A LITTLE
PLASTIC OVEN WHILE

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.858
WATCHING BOY
BANDS ON TV?

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.827
UH, AKIZA'S A SENIOR
AT DUEL ACADEMY.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.362
AND SHE'S THE BEST
IN HER CLASS.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.164
OH, OH,
I AM SO SCARED.

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.832
THIS AIN'T DUEL SCHOOL.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.168
TURBO DUELS ARE THE
TOUGHEST DUELS EVER.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.271
AND IT TAKES A REAL MAN
TO HANDLE A DUEL RUNNER.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.573
SO WHEN ARE THESE
"REAL MEN" SUPPOSED
TO SHOW UP?

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.375
HUH?
UH.

00:02:56.043 --> 00:02:57.678
Teacher: HEY, YOU FOUR,
ENOUGH DAWDLIN'!

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.646
THE TRACK'S NOT
WALKIN' OVER TO YOU!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.915
MOVE IT!

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.017
IT'S TIME FOR THE TRAINING
WHEELS TO COME OFF,

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:05.118
BOYS AND GIRL.

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:07.421
NO MORE AUTOPILOT
FROM HERE ON OUT.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:08.689
IT'S JUST YOU,
YOUR RUNNER,

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.223
AND THE CRUEL,
CRUEL PAVEMENT.

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:11.291
NOW GET
ON YOUR RIDES

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.327
'N SHOW ME WHAT
YOU'RE MADE OF!

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.800
WHAT'D I MISS?

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:21.802
THIS IS CAKE.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.170
I'M GONNA FLY AROUND
THIS TRACK FASTER THAN

00:03:23.837 --> 00:03:25.872
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:29.676
WHOA!

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:34.281
WELL, EVEN LIGHTNING
CRASHES.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:35.515
Teacher: NUMBSKULL!

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:36.883
YA WENT TOO FAST!

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:37.951
NEXT!

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.052
UH. OKAY!

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.420
JUST STAY UPRIGHT.

00:03:41.088 --> 00:03:42.022
JUST STAY UPRIGHT.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.123
I MADE IT!

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.424
Teacher:
TOO SLOW, GRANNY PANTS!

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:47.127
I COULDA LAPPED YA
4 TIMES ALREADY!

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:48.161
WHO'S NEXT?!

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.597
Akiza: I AM!

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:54.367
GO, AKIZA, RIP IT UP!

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:55.836
THIS SPEED.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.271
THE WHOLE WORLD JUST FLYING
AT ME LIKE THIS--

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.440
IT'S--IT'S--

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:02.109
IT'S SO INCREDIBLE!

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.178
WOOOOOO HOOOOO!!

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.047
AKIZA!

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.281
SLOW DOWN! YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO--

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:09.316
[BANG]

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.518
Akiza: I'M OKAY!

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.297
SHE'S GETTIN' BETTER
'N BETTER EVERY DAY.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:26.166
YUP.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:29.369
YOU'RE MINE, SHARP CURVE!

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:33.507
AAH!

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:34.674
AKIZA, YOU OKAY?

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.576
OH, MAN!
EASY DOES IT.

00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:40.046
I ALMOST HAD IT.
I JUST--

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:41.515
THAT'S IT!

00:04:42.182 --> 00:04:44.050
IF MORE I DRIFT AT THE TURN
OF THE BEGINNING, THEN GUN IT

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:45.652
WHEN I BEND THE ROUND

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:46.987
AND HOLD THE TORQUE,

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:48.421
THAT OUGHTA DO IT.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.159
I THINK SHE'S CRASHED
ONE TOO MANY TIMES.

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:56.229
UH! HOLD IT.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.802
UH!

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.771
Yusei: YOU'RE PUSHING
TOO HARD.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:08.642
OKAY, I THINK I'VE
GOT THE HANG OF IT.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.676
GOOD.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.512
JUST KEEP TRUSTING
YOUR INSTINCTS.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:15.215
ANGLE OF ENTRY IS GOOD.

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:17.417
AND THE BIKE IS
GRIPPING THE TRACK RIGHT.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.486
NOW JUST LET IT DRIFT
WITH THE CURVE.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.222
JUST LET IT DRIFT.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:25.792
I DID IT!

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.827
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.095
VERY NICE.

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:34.501
Yusei: THIS SHOULD
HELP STABILIZE
THE HANDLING, AKIZA.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.538
[THINKING]
IT'S SO NICE OF YUSEI
TO HELP ME LIKE THIS.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.580
TIME TO REV IT UP.

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:02.028
OH, MAN, JUST--WOW!

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:03.697
THAT'S HER BEST TIME YET!

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:05.165
Teacher: YOU QUALIFY!

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:06.433
YOU BET I DO!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.500
OH, AKIZA.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.002
[THINKING]
SHE MAY HAVE QUALIFIED.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.605
BUT THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S
PASSING THE FINAL EXAM.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.940
I'LL SEE TO THAT.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.658
Teacher: WELL, IT'S BEEN
A GRUELING TWO WEEKS!

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.060
BUT AKIZA'S THE ONLY ONE OF
YOU SORRY PUNKS THAT EVEN

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.062
QUALIFIED FOR THE FINAL EXAM!

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.934
THE REST OF YA'LL ARE
LITTLE FAILURE BABY MEN!

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:42.669
YOU GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.471
THIS IS BUNK.

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.640
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW LAME WE ARE.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:48.575
YEAH.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.645
Yusei: ALL YOU GOTTA DO NOW
IS PASS THE FINAL EXAM.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:53.013
YOU CAN DO IT, AKIZA.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.114
YOU THINK?

00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.182
OF COURSE, THOUGH
THERE'S ONE TRICK

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.919
YOU MIGHT
WANNA LEARN.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.629
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO DRIFT BACKWARDS.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:11.798
I'M GUESSING IT'S
HARDER THAN IT LOOKS?

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:13.166
AT FIRST.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:15.101
BUT ONCE YOU KNOW YOU
CAN PULL IT OFF, YOU'RE READY

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.103
FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THAT
MIGHT COME YOUR WAY.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.006
RIGHT. LET ME TRY.

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:24.844
AAH!

00:07:25.512 --> 00:07:28.815
THIS LOOKS BAD.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:30.884
HUH?
HUH?

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.990
ANYONE GET THE LICENSE
PLATE ON THAT RHINO?

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:40.794
[CHATTER]

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.497
UM, DO YOU FEEL LIKE
A THIRD WHEEL?

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:46.066
THIS ISN'T
A DATE, LEO.

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:47.467
IT'S ALL ABOUT
REMEMBERING WHAT WAS

00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.804
BEHIND YOU
AND RELAXING.

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:57.644
UH...

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:58.645
YOU HAVE, UH...

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:01.247
SKATED BEFORE,
RIGHT?

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:03.817
I'VE WATCHED PEOPLE
SKATING IN THE PARK.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:05.719
SEE? THIS IS
TOTALLY A DATE.

00:08:06.386 --> 00:08:07.787
LEO, HE'S TRYING
TO TEACH HER

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.323
SOMETHING
ABOUT TURBO DUELING.

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.092
IT'S ALL ABOUT
ANTICIPATION.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.860
MAYBE I SHOULD
LEARN HOW TO GO
FORWARD FIRST.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.129
YOU HAVE TO JUST TRUST
YOURSELF AND LET GO.

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.031
JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I MEANT TO DO THAT!

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.868
YOU GOT IT!
NOW SPIN AROUND
AND COAST!

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:25.605
STILL THINKIN'
IT'S NOT A DATE?

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.408
OKAY, YEAH, IT'S
TOTALLY A DATE.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.677
I KNOW YOU CAN
DO THIS, AKIZA.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.546
JUST TRUST YOURSELF.

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:39.819
HUH?

00:08:40.487 --> 00:08:41.287
HEY!

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.223
Jack: ABOUT TIME
YOU SHOWED UP.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.025
WHAT IS THIS?!

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.460
Yusei: YOUR PRACTICE BIKE
WASN'T CUTTING IT ANYMORE,

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.562
SO WE MADE A
FEW ADJUSTMENTS.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.065
Crow: I INSTALLED THE
BRAKE SYSTEM AND THE
DECK INTERFACE.

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.068
Yusei: I ADDED
TO THE FRAME AND
RECONFIGURED THE ENGINE.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.303
Jack:
I PROVIDED VERBAL
ENCOURAGEMENT.

00:08:57.971 --> 00:08:58.772
IT'S AWESOME!

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.441
IT'S A REAL RUNNER.

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:05.645
I GUESS THAT...NOW ALL
IT NEEDS IS A REAL RIDER.

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.048
ARE YOU READY?

00:09:17.424 --> 00:09:18.858
LOOKS LIKE WE
JUST MADE IT.

00:09:19.526 --> 00:09:21.461
Leo: HERE GOES
THE FIRST GUY.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.067
AAH! OH!

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:28.601
Crow: OOH, WIPE-OUT!

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.971
Jack: POOR SAP
NEVER DREW A CARD.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.541
HEH!

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.476
ANOTHER WANNABE
BITES THE DUST.

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:37.510
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:38.912
IS THAT TRUDGE!?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.781
WELL! IF IT ISN'T
THE PEANUT GALLERY!

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:43.283
YOU'RE UP, AKIZA.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:44.951
CONGRATS FOR
GETTING THIS FAR.

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.153
NOW THERE'S JUST ONE THING
STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR

00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:48.588
TURBO LICENSE.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.924
AND THAT THING IS HANDSOME,
WEARS A SHARP UNIFORM,

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.126
AND ANSWERS TO
"OFFICER TRUDGE."

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:55.728
AND IT'S PLANNING ON
WIPING THE ROAD
WITH YOU, KID.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:58.665
AW, COME ON.
HE'S REALLY GONNA
TRASH TALK AFTER ALL

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.233
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH TOGETHER?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.302
THERE'S NO WAY SHE
CAN DEFEAT HIM.

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:04.370
YOU EVER HEAD OF
SCHADENFREUDE?

00:10:05.038 --> 00:10:05.672
YOU MEAN "PLEASURE
DERIVED FROM

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.140
THE MISFORTUNE
OF OTHERS?"

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:10.643
SURE HAVE.
HEE HEE HEE!

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.481
SORRY, AKIZA, BUT I
CAN'T GO EASY ON YA.

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:15.949
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:19.752
IT'S NOW TIME TO
BEGIN THE TURBO
REGISTRATION FINAL EXAM.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.954
ON YOUR MARKS.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:22.789
GET SET.
DUEL!

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:25.492
[TIRES SQUEAL]

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.829
FIRST, I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED WORLD 2
FIELD SPELL!

00:10:30.497 --> 00:10:30.864
LET'S RIDE!

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.365
Computer: DUEL MODE ENGAGED.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:35.201
AUTOPILOT ACTIVATED.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.838
[THINKING]
IF I TAKE THE FIRST
CURVE BEFORE TRUDGE,

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:40.740
I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:45.845
[THINKING]
LET'S FIND OUT
WHAT SHE'S GOT.

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.181
YES!

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:50.917
SHE TOOK THAT
CORNER PERFECTLY!

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.521
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR? THE
FIRST MOVE'S YOURS!

00:10:55.188 --> 00:10:56.823
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YA, KID?

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.692
LOOK, NO ONE'LL
BLAME YA' IF YOU
WANNA QUIT NOW.

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.562
I MEAN, NOBODY
EXPECTS YOU
TO PASS, ANYWAY.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:06.065
MAN, TRUDGE IS DOIN'
EVERYTHING HE CAN TO
SHAKE HER UP, ISN'T HE?

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.067
WHY IS HE BEING
LIKE THAT?

00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:10.103
HE'S JUST MAKING SURE
THAT SHE CAN TAKE IT,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.505
'CAUSE IF A LITTLE
PRESSURE THROWS HER OFF,

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:15.975
THEN HER GAME'LL
NEVER PASS THIS TEST.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.797
THE FIRST MOVE'S
MINE. I DRAW!

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:41.134
[THINKING]
A SPEED SPELL.
PERFECT.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.270
COME ON, KID,
SHOW ME THAT YOU'VE
GOT WHAT IT TAKES

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:46.506
TO PROVE ALL
THE DOUBTERS WRONG.

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:51.377
I SUMMON REVIVAL ROSE
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:54.914
AND NEXT, I ACTIVATE
THE SUMMON SPEEDER
SPEED SPELL!

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:56.816
Computer: ACTION PROHIBITED.
Akiza: HUH!?

00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:00.920
HUH? DID SHE JUST DO
WHAT I THINK
SHE JUST DID?

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:05.725
MM-HMM. I GUESS SHE FORGOT
THAT SPEED SPELLS REQUIRE
SOME ACTUAL SPEED.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.962
SHE'S MORE NERVOUS
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.032
[THINKING]
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. THE WHOLE
SPEED COUNTER THING.

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.669
STOP STALLING!
MAKE YOUR NEXT MOVE!

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.205
I--I END MY TURN!

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.210
MY MOVE THEN!

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.782
I SUMMON STYGIAN STREET
PATROL IN ATTACK MODE!

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.988
LET'S RUMBLE!
GO, STREET PATROL,

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:38.358
SEND HER ROSE
TO THE SLAMMER!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.597
AND NOW, STYGIAN
STREET PATROL'S SPECIAL
ABILITY ACTIVATES.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:47.200
AFTER DESTROYING
YOUR MONSTER IN BATTLE,
IT CAN KNOCK YOU

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.869
WITH DAMAGE EQUAL
TO THE LEVEL OF YOUR
DEFEATED MONSTER

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:52.839
MULTIPLIED
BY 100 POINTS!

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:55.608
I SLAP ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN!

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:58.478
[THINKING]
IF I DON'T GET IT
TOGETHER, I'M DONE FOR.

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.080
ARE YOU FEELIN'
THE PRESSURE YET, AKIZA?

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:03.616
HA HA! HOW 'BOUT NOW?
UHH!

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.585
IT'S MY TURN.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.854
I DRAW!

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:12.225
AND I SUMMON
TWILIGHT ROSE KNIGHT!

00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:17.363
AND WHEN TWILIGHT
ROSE KNIGHT IS
SUCCESSFULLY SUMMONED,

00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:21.000
IT CAN IMMEDIATELY
GRANT ME THE ABILITY
TO SUMMON A LEVEL-FOUR

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.536
OR BELOW PLANT-TYPE
MONSTER FROM MY HAND!

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:28.274
SO I'M SUMMONING
LORD POISON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:31.277
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!
SHE'S FINDING HER GROOVE.

00:13:31.944 --> 00:13:33.513
Akiza: AND NOW
LORD POISON GETS
A TUNING

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.883
FROM TWILIGHT
ROSE KNIGHT.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.894
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:50.997
HEH! PRETTY GOOD, AKIZA.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.500
BUT IF YOU THINK SOME
OVERGROWN FLOWER LIZARD'S
GONNA PUT THE FEAR IN ME,

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.236
THEN YOU NEED TO GET REAL
AND GET SERIOUS.

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:59.472
YEAH, WELL,
LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE
STILL SAYING THAT

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:04.377
AFTER BLACK ROSE DRAGON
ATTACKS STYGIAN
STREET PATROL!

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.047
NOT A GOOD MOVE, AKIZA.

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:12.051
NOT WITH MY FINAL PENALTY
TRAP CARD ON THE FIELD!
HUH?

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.420
SEE, WHEN YOU DESTROY ONE
OF MY MONSTERS IN BATTLE,

00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:17.156
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL
TO HALF ITS ATTACK POINTS,

00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:21.394
AND THEN FINAL PENALTY
OBLITERATES YOUR
ATTACKING MONSTER.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.630
AAH! OH!

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.666
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR THE DRAGON.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.101
DON'T LET HIM
GET TO YOU.

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:29.502
COME RIGHT BACK
AT HIM.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.971
SINCE YOU DESTROYED
ONE OF MY MONSTERS,

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:36.442
I CAN SUMMON
REVIVAL ROSE
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.746
NEXT, I PLACE
TWO CARDS FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:42.181
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL!

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:45.184
BY YANKING STYGIAN
STREET PATROL FROM
MY GRAVEYARD

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:47.186
AND REMOVING IT
ENTIRELY FROM PLAY,

00:14:47.854 --> 00:14:51.157
I CAN RADIO FOR BACK-UP
AND SUMMON A FIEND
MONSTER FROM MY HAND!

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:53.459
AND LOOK WHO'S ARRIVING
ON THE SCENE--

00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:57.163
ANOTHER STYGIAN
STREET PATROL!

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:02.001
NEXT, I SUMMON STYGIAN
SECURITY IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.305
AND SINCE THESE TWO JUST
LOVE WORKING TOGETHER,

00:15:06.973 --> 00:15:09.876
I THINK I'LL TUNE
MY STYGIAN SECURITY WITH
MY STYGIAN STREET PATROL

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:13.546
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
THE STYGIAN SERGEANTS!

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:15.948
[ROARING]

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:17.650
TIME FOR SOME BRUTALITY!

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.621
STYGIAN SERGEANTS,
UPROOT THAT REVIVAL ROSE!

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.856
BUT I'M NOT DONE THERE!

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:25.792
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT OFFICERS TEAMING UP

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.227
TO PLAY GOOD-COP,
BAD-COP, RIGHT?

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:31.764
WELL, STYGIAN SERGEANTS
PREFER TO PLAY
BAD-COP BAD-COP.

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.700
WHEN THEY SUCCESSFULLY
DESTROY YOUR MONSTER
IN BATTLE,

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:39.739
THEY GAIN 800 ATTACK
POINTS AND THEN
ATTACK YOU AGAIN.

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:43.242
OH, NO. SHE'S GOT
2800 LIFE POINTS.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.012
IF HE LANDS
THIS ATTACK,
THEN IT'S ALL OVER.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.947
HA HA HA!

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:51.717
NOW I ATTACK YOU
DIRECTLY!

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.288
I ACTIVATE
THE OFFENSIVE GUARD
TRAP CARD!

00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.690
WHEN YOU ATTACK ME
DIRECTLY, I CAN USE
THE POWER

00:15:58.357 --> 00:15:59.659
OF OFFENSIVE GUARD
TO HALVE THE
ATTACK POINTS

00:16:00.393 --> 00:16:02.061
OF YOUR MONSTER
UNTIL THE END PHASE
OF THIS TURN.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:06.299
AND THEN I CAN
DRAW ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK!

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.938
COME ON! YOU SURVIVED
THAT ATTACK?!

00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:14.006
WELL, MY TURN'S
NOT OVER YET!

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:17.210
AND I'M ACTIVATING
THE SPEED SPELL
SPEED DEMON!

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:19.512
WHEN I HAVE 3 SPEED COUNTERS,
I CAN USE SPEED DEMON

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:23.149
TO KNOCK YOU WITH
A THOUSAND POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.853
WELL, SHE'S STILL
HANGING ON, BUT NOT
BY VERY MUCH.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.521
STUPID TRUDGE.

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:32.024
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:35.461
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I WILL.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:40.099
I SUMMON WITCH
OF THE BLACK ROSE!

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:43.402
WHEN I SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMON THIS MONSTER
TO MY FIELD,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.471
I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD
FROM MY DECK.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:47.607
BUT IF THE CARD
I DRAW'S NOT
A MONSTER CARD,

00:16:48.274 --> 00:16:50.142
THEN WITCH OF
THE BLACK ROSE'LL
BE DESTROYED.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.013
I DRAW! AND IT'S
DARK VERGER, SO
MY WITCH IS SAFE!

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.015
HMM! SAFE, BUT USELESS.
HUH?

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.417
I PLAY
CLIMACTIC BARRICADE!

00:16:59.085 --> 00:17:00.987
THIS TRAP CAN ACTIVATE
WHEN YOU SUMMON A MONSTER,

00:17:01.654 --> 00:17:04.891
AND ONCE IT DOES, I CAN
SEAL THAT MONSTER AWAY
FOR THE REST OF THIS TURN!

00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:08.261
BUT THAT'S NOT THE
ONLY PIECE OF BAD NEWS
I HAVE FOR YOU, AKIZA.

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:11.531
FOR EVERY LEVEL-FOUR
OR BELOW MONSTER
YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIELD,

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.334
CLIMACTIC BARRICADE
DISHES OUT 500 POINTS
OF DAMAGE.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:19.572
SO LIKE I SAID EARLIER,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO TURN THINGS AROUND.

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.542
I'VE GOT
4 SPEED COUNTERS.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.510
LET'S SEE IF I CAN
TURN THINGS AROUND

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:26.946
WITH THE SUMMON
SPEEDER SPEED SPELL.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:31.884
THIS SPELL ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON ANOTHER
MONSTER FROM MY HAND.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.121
I THINK I LIKE WHERE
THIS DUEL IS GOING, AKIZA.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.757
YOU MAY HAVE STOPPED
WITCH OF THE BLACK ROSE
FROM ATTACKING,

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.259
BUT I CAN STILL USE IT
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:17:40.927 --> 00:17:43.796
SO NOW IT GIVES
DARK VERGER A TUNE-UP.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:49.702
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
SPLENDID ROSE!

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:53.806
NEXT, I ACTIVATE
SPLENDID ROSE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.108
BY TAKING
A PLANT MONSTER
FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:56.776 --> 00:17:58.110
AND REMOVING IT
ENTIRELY FROM PLAY,

00:17:58.778 --> 00:17:59.845
I CAN CUT BACK
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.981
OF A MONSTER ON
THE FIELD BY HALF!

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:05.384
YOUR STYGIAN
SERGEANTS JUST GOT
A LITTLE WEAKER.

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:07.653
[ROARING]

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.157
AND WITH THAT,
SPLENDID ROSE ATTACKS
STYGIAN SERGEANTS!

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:13.492
WHIP IT!

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.230
TOO LITTLE TOO LATE!

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.633
I'M NOT DONE.
THERE'S MORE WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.767
THERE IS?

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.703
I REVEAL
MY TRAP CARD!

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.671
BLOSSOM BOMBARDMENT!

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:28.674
Computer:
WHEN YOUR PLANT-TYPE MONSTER
DESTROYS A MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:33.346
BLOSSOM BOMBARDMENT DEALS DAMAGE
EQUAL TO HALF THE DESTROYED
MONSTERS ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:34.013 --> 00:18:35.848
NOW GET READY
FOR MY SPLENDID ROSE

00:18:36.515 --> 00:18:40.186
TO PRUNE YOUR LIFE
POINTS DOWN TO SIZE.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.822
VERY CLEVER.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.658
DUDE, WHAT IF THIS GIRL
ACTUALLY WINS THIS?

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:47.460
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
HUH?

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.529
TIME FOR
THE DEMOLITION DERBY.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.204
OH!
AKIZA!

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.506
HEH, HEH!
TAKE THAT, LOSER!

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.642
OH! OH!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.578
WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD,
BUT IF SHE CAN'T REACT
FAST ENOUGH,

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:08.080
THEN SHE'S NOT CUT OUT
TO BE A TURBO DUELIST.

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.149
OH! OH!

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.536
OH! I CAN'T DO THIS.

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.139
IT'S ALL
ABOUT ANTICIPATION.

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:36.409
I KNOW YOU CAN
DO THIS, AKIZA.
JUST TRUST YOURSELF.

00:19:37.076 --> 00:19:37.476
[THINKING]
YUSEI'S RIGHT!

00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:40.279
AND IT'S TIME
I PROVE IT.

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:49.822
LOOK AT HER GO!

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.158
I KNEW
SHE COULD DO IT.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.495
WHERE DID SHE LEARN HOW
TO RIDE LIKE THAT?

00:19:57.163 --> 00:19:58.998
TRUDGE,
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.934
I ACTIVATE
SPLENDID ROSE'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.904
BY REMOVING A
PLANT MONSTER IN MY
GRAVEYARD FROM PLAY,

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:07.106
I CAN EMPOWER
SPLENDID ROSE
TO ATTACK AGAIN

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:08.641
WITH HALF
ITS ATTACK POINTS!

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:12.278
AND SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MONSTERS OUT ON
YOUR FIELD, TRUDGE,

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:16.649
SPLENDID ROSE
ATTACKS YOU!
GO, AERIAL TWIST!

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.094
GOOD JOB, AKIZA!

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.996
YOU PASSED THE TEST.
HA HA!

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:33.666
HA HA HA!
NICE.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:35.935
THAT'S OUR GIRL!

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:38.904
NEXT TIME,
LEAVE MY FRIEND ALONE.

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:42.508
[ALL GROANING]

00:20:45.044 --> 00:20:49.281
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ALL
THE PIECES ARE GATHERING
ON THE BOARD.

00:20:55.521 --> 00:20:58.758
HEY, YOU, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE AN OFFICIAL TURBO DUELIST?

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:02.394
GREAT. JUST GREAT.
