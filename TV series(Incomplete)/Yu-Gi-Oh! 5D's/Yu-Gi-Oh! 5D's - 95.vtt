WEBVTT

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.337
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S"!

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.208
[THINKING] I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW TIME FLIES.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.010
IT'S ALREADY BEEN 3 YEARS SINCE

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.813
YOU DISAPPEARED IN THAT
MYSTERIOUS PURPLE GLOW,
PEARSON...

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:16.250
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT ALL SECTOR SECURITY
FOUND THAT NIGHT

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.052
WAS A DIGITAL RECORDING CHIP
WITH A MESSAGE FROM YOU

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.855
ASKING ME TO WATCH OVER
THE KIDS YOU TOOK CARE OF

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.758
AND TO KEEP YOUR
DUEL DISK AND RUNNER SAFE.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.361
Crow: SO WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT, TRUDGE?

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.531
IT'S ABOUT AN OLD FRIEND
OF YOURS--ROBERT PEARSON.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:32.132
WE JUST RECENTLY
DISCOVERED THAT,

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:33.767
BEFORE THAT
PURPLE GLOW APPEARED,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.402
PEARSON WAS
DUELING SOMEONE...

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:39.706
AND... THIS IS THE CARD
HIS OPPONENT WAS USING.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.441
YOU SEE, A FEW YEARS BACK,

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.943
THEY TRIED
DEVELOPING CARDS THAT HAD

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.412
MORE THAN JUST
VISUAL EFFECTS.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.580
IT WORKED...

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.981
IT WAS ALSO RUMORED
THAT THESE CARDS

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.484
HAD THE ABILITY TO SEND
PEOPLE TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.252
THE NETHERWORLD?
WHOA...

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.620
THERE WERE
A FEW PROTOTYPES

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.455
ALREADY RELEASED
TO THE DUELING PUBLIC

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.558
THAT ARE STILL
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

00:00:57.558 --> 00:00:59.660
CRIMSON MEFIST
IS ONE OF THEM.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.461
THE SOONER WE KNOW
WHO THE OWNER

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:05.132
OF THIS HIGHLY DANGEROUS
AND ONE OF A KIND CARD IS...

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.366
THE SOONER WE'LL KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.969
TO YOUR FRIEND
ROBERT PEARSON.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.404
Crow, thinking: I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHO PEARSON

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.039
WAS DUELIN'
ON THAT FATEFUL DAY--

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.542
WHICH MEANS I GOTTA TALK
TO THOSE WHO WERE
CLOSEST TO HIM...

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.711
Crow: YOU'VE
REALLY DONE WELL
FOR YOURSELF, BOLTON.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.580
JUST CHECK OUT
ALL THESE AWARDS!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.583
NO WONDER YOU'RE
THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE
DUEL RUNNER MAKER.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.951
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YA.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:26.453
ENOUGH ABOUT ME,
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:29.489
OH, PLENTY. I MEAN,
IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:30.791
THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU WAS ON

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.593
THAT TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE DAY...

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.162
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
KIND OF WHY I'M HERE.

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:38.498
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHO CAUSED PEARSON
TO DISAPPEAR.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.233
I WAS HOPIN' THAT
MAYBE YOU WOULD KNOW

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.902
SOMETHIN' ABOUT
THAT CARD.

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.070
HERE...

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:47.307
YOU KNOW SOMETHIN'.
TELL ME!

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.910
WHO WAS IT THAT USED
THIS CARD ON PEARSON?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.178
BOLTON!

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.214
MY TIME IS VALUABLE,
BUT I DO HAVE INFORMATION.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.017
SO IF YOU WANT IT, YOU'LL
HAVE TO DUEL ME FOR IT!

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.752
DUEL YOU?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.154
IF YOU BEAT ME, I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW...

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:03.423
HOWEVER, IF I WIN...

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.827
YOU HAVE TO HAND OVER
THE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
TO ME!

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.730
WELL?!
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?!

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.264
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG TO AGREE?

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.634
LET'S JUST SAY
I HAD TO MAKE SURE

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:15.769
THAT WHAT I WAS
DOING WAS RIGHT.

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.906
Both: DUEL!!!

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.976
Bolton: WHITE WARRIOR--
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER ATTACK!

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.516
YOUR MOVE!

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.852
AND I WOULD MAKE IT
COUNT IF I WERE YOU...

00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:33.987

I GOT PLENTY!

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.297
[THINKING] QUESTION IS,
CAN I USE ANY OF IT?

00:03:50.297 --> 00:03:51.732
AFTER ALL,
I CAN'T PLAY ANY OF

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.200
MY BLACKWINGS'
SPECIAL ABILITIES

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.735
SO LONG AS
THAT WHITEOUT TRAP

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:55.969
IS SITTIN' ON THE FIELD.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.471
IT'S CLEAR WHAT
I'VE GOTTA DO...

00:03:57.471 --> 00:04:00.407
GET RID OF WHITEOUT
WITH A TRAP OF MY OWN!

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.909
I PLACE ONE FACEDOWN!
AND THEN...

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.077
I'LL SUMMON THE TUNER...

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.246
BLACKWING--MISTRAL
THE SILVER SHIELD...

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.848
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:04:07.848 --> 00:04:09.583
AND THAT'S MY TURN!

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:13.253
THEN IT'S MY MOVE!

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.422
AND WITH IT, I'LL SUMMON
THE TUNER MONSTER,

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.824
WHITE WARRIOR--
SNOW THE ROPE DART!

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:20.060
[GRUNTS]

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.130
AND FOR EVERY CARD
ON THE FIELD,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.500
ROPE DART ROPES IN 100
ADDITIONAL ATTACK POINTS!

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.036
SO, SINCE THERE ARE 7,
HE POWERS UP BY 700!

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.074
NOW, SNOW THE ROPE DART,

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:36.276
ATTACK CROW'S
LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:37.444
GO...!

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.147
[GRUNTS]

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:43.984
CROW!

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:48.021
NOW, SINCE THAT DIRECT
ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL,

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.490
I CAN USE THE ABILITY OF
FOG THE TREASURE SHIELD...

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.628
AND DESTROY ONE SPELL OR
TRAP CARD ON YOUR FIELD!

00:04:54.628 --> 00:04:56.496
DO YOUR THING,
TREASURE SHIELD!

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:02.702
NUTS! MY TRAP STUN CARD
IS KAPUT!

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.070
DON'T TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T THINK

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.173
I KNEW WHAT YOU
WERE PLANNING, CROW.

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:09.342
I KNOW YOUR DUEL STRATEGIES
ALL TOO WELL!

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:10.544
[GRUNTS]

00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:12.646
CROW'S GOTTA MIX IT UP
MORE--ESPECIALLY SINCE

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.481
HE'S DUELING
AN OLD FRIEND.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.949
YOU'RE UP, CROW...

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.784
HERE GOES!

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:25.292
I SUMMON BLACKWING--
SHURA THE BLUE FLAME!

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:27.561
NOW, LEVEL 2 MISTRAL
THE SILVER SHIELD

00:05:27.561 --> 00:05:30.330
TUNES WITH LEVEL 4
SHURA THE BLUE FLAME...

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.034
GO AND LET YOUR
WINGS GIVE FLIGHT

00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:36.803
TO A NEW AND EVEN
MIGHTIER BIRD OF PREY...

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:40.974
I SUMMON OUT...
BLACKWING ARMOR MASTER!

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.645
YES! A SYNCHRO MONSTER
IS JUST WHAT CROW NEEDS!

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.582
Crow: BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.685
NOW ATTACKS
SNOW THE ROPE DART!

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.486
I PLAY
ROPE DART'S ABILITY!

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.222
IT LETS ME RETURN HIM
TO MY HAND

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:57.691
WHENEVER HE'S
THE TARGET OF AN ATTACK!

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.460
ALRIGHT... THEN I'LL JUST
ATTACK TREASURE SHIELD...!

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.995
AND WHEN BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.830
ATTACKS A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.433
HE GAINS
500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.904
[CRIES OUT]

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.807
AND SINCE ARMOR MASTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.942
WERE MORE THAN
YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.378
YOU NOW TAKE
THE DIFFERENCE
AS DAMAGE!

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:20.380
[GROWLS]

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.382
BOLTON'S TUNER MONSTER
ESCAPED HARM

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.551
BUT AT LEAST CROW
TOOK OUT SOMETHING.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.587
RIGHT, BECAUSE SINCE
SACRED ARROW IS
STILL ON THE FIELD--

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:29.089
COME THIS TURN'S
END PHASE,

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.525
BOLTON WILL NOW TAKE
AN EXTRA 400 POINTS
OF DAMAGE.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.328
I PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
AND END MY TURN.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.203
SORRY, BOLTON...
YOU'RE A FRIEND...

00:06:43.203 --> 00:06:45.805
BUT I JUST GOTTA
WIN THIS DUEL!

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.376
I GOTTA FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO PEARSON!

00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.845
[THINKING]
AND NOTHIN'S
GONNA STOP ME!

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:07.327
MY MOVE...

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.696
AND IT'LL BE
ONE TO REMEMBER!

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.498
SO GET READY, OLD FRIEND!

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.732
HERE WE GO!

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.835
ONCE AGAIN,
I SUMMON TO THE FIELD

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.105
WHITE WARRIOR--
SNOW THE ROPE DART
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:24.210
AND NEXT, I'LL TUNE
LEVEL 4 SNOW THE ROPE DART

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.579
WITH LEVEL 4
HAIL THE IRON HAMMER!

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.784
NOW THE POWER
COURSING THROUGH

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.485
THE VEINS OF
THESE TWO WARRIORS

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:33.887
WILL BECOME ONE!

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.823
I SUMMON FORTH...

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:39.893
THE SYNCHRO MONSTER...
CRIMSON MEFIST!

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.497
WAIT, CRIMSON MEFIST?!

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.999
BOLTON OWNS THAT CARD?!

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.168
WELL, THIS SURE
COMPLICATES THINGS.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.471
[LAUGHS]

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.407
BOLTON!
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THIS CARD?

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.344
NO WAY...
YOU'RE THE ONE

00:07:57.344 --> 00:07:59.212
WHO WAS DUELING
PEARSON THAT NIGHT?

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.483
BUT WHY?
YOU WERE HIS FRIEND--

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.151
HE WAS SOMEONE
YOU ADMIRED!

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.886
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.422
WHY ELSE--SO I COULD
MANUFACTURE DUEL RUNNERS.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:11.157
DUEL RUNNERS?

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:13.259
THAT'S RIGHT.
AT FIRST, THE PLAN WAS

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.595
FOR ALL OF US TO COME
WORK TOGETHER.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:18.665
YOU REMEMBER.
YOU WERE PART OF IT.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.067
BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT
HAVE KNOWN IS THAT, ONE DAY,

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.969
A WEALTHY ENTREPRENEUR
FROM THE CITY

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.405
OFFERED TO INVEST IN
OUR LITTLE BUSINESS.

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:29.542
WHAT--I NEVER HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:32.278
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
PEARSON REFUSED.
[GASP]

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:36.016
HE DIDN'T WANT TO SELL OFF
THE RIGHTS TO HIS DESIGNS.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:39.252
HIS DREAM WAS TO MAKE DUEL
RUNNERS FOR PEOPLE LIKE US.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.920
HE WAS AFRAID
THESE SUITS WOULD ONLY BE

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.889
INTERESTED IN
MAKING A BUCK.

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:46.226
IT WAS AN AMAZING
OPPORTUNITY!

00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:47.861
AND IT WAS
COMPLETELY SQUANDERED

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.430
BECAUSE OF PEARSON
AND HIS STUPID PRINCIPLES!

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.698
WHICH IS WHY...

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.134
BOLTON?

00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:55.802
SORRY...
BUT I'M TAKING

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.237
THE DUEL RUNNER
BLUEPRINTS.

00:08:57.237 --> 00:08:59.739
IF YOU WANT TO STOP ME,
THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO DO SO

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.107
BY DUELING ME!

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:06.246
AS YOU KNOW,
HE DIDN'T STOP ME.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.348
I WON AND WAS ABLE
TO TAKE THE MONEY

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:11.117
AND START THE COMPANY
UNIMPEDED BY PEARSON.

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.820
SURE, MAYBE I HAD TO MAKE
A COUPLE SACRIFICES

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.789
ALONG THE WAY,
BUT SO WHAT?

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.924
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT
I WAS FINALLY IN BUSINESS!

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:19.859
[GROWLS]
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.561
I'M GOING TO PROTECT
THAT BUSINESS

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.196
NO MATTER WHAT
I HAVE TO DO!

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:24.330
THAT'S WHY...

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.332
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME
THAT BLACK-WINGED DRAGON

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.967
AND GIVE IT TO ME NOW!

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:29.736
ENOUGH WITH
ALL YOUR DENIALS!

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.204
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT!

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:33.306
I KNOW PEARSON
GAVE IT TO YOU!

00:09:34.808 --> 00:09:36.676
I'VE EXPLAINED WHY
I DID WHAT I DID,

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.011
SO GIVE ME THE CARD!

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.345
NOW!

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.949
YEAH, YOU
EXPLAINED IT...

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:44.584
BUT THAT DON'T
MAKE IT RIGHT--

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.620
BECAUSE OF YOU
PEARSON IS GONE!

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.422
VERY WELL THEN, CROW.

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.191
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE
THE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON

00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:53.593
BY DEFEATING YOU
IN THIS DUEL!

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.728
EVEN IT MEANS
I MUST SEND YOU AWAY

00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.297
JUST LIKE I DID PEARSON.

00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:59.766
I ACTIVATE
CRIMSON MEFIST'S ABILITY!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.802
NOW, ONCE PER TURN, FOR EVERY
CARD YOU HAVE ON YOUR FIELD,

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:05.972
YOU TAKE 300 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.307
WHAT?

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:10.810
OH NO!

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.982
NEXT, CRIMSON MEFIST
WILL ATTACK BLACKWING
ARMOR MASTER

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.584
WITH RANCID RUSH!

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.522
[CRIES OUT]

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.390
WHAT'S THIS--?!
NO WAY...

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.960
THE DAMAGE CROW'S TAKING
LOOKS LIKE IT'S REAL!

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.063
SO THEN IT'S TRUE...

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:32.499
THAT CARD DOES INFLICT
ACTUAL DAMAGE...

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.635
AND I BET
IT ALSO SENT PEARSON
TO THE NETHERWORLD.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.837
THEN THE STAKES
COULDN'T BE HIGHER...

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:40.607
AND NOW, SINCE IT'S
THIS TURN'S END PHASE--

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:42.976
SACRED ARROW'S
EFFECT ACTIVATES!

00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:48.982
WELL, CROW?
HAVE YOU RECONSIDERED?

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.350
GIVE ME THE CARD!

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.318
THINGS DON'T NEED TO END
THE SAME WAY FOR YOU

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.686
AS THEY DID FOR PEARSON!

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:57.390
NO WAY, BOLTON,
I'M IN THIS THING
'TIL THE VERY END!

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.092
I'M IN THIS FOR PEARSON!

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:16.976
IT'S MY TURN!

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.444
AND I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.580
OF SPEED WORLD 2! GO!

00:11:21.581 --> 00:11:23.616
NOW, BY REMOVIN'
7 SPEED COUNTERS,

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:26.319
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW
ONE CARD FROM MY DECK.

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:27.720
YES.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.656
I SUMMON THE TUNER
MONSTER BLACKWING--

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:31.958
KOCHI THE DAYBREAK
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.161
[CHIRPS]

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.030
AND I'LL THROW
A FACEDOWN!

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.733
NOT SO FAST--CRIMSON MEFIST'S
ABILITY NOW ACTIVATES!

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:43.970
YOU SEE, SINCE YOU PLACED
A SPELL OR TRAP CARD FACEDOWN,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.072
YOU TAKE 300 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.173
[GASPS]

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.178
[CRIES OUT]

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.381
OK--NOW WE KNOW
THE DAMAGE THAT
THING GIVES IS REAL!

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.218
YEAH, EVEN CROW'S
DUEL RUNNER IS
GETTING DINGED UP!

00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.552
SURRENDER NOW, CROW!

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.422
SURRENDER OR
VANISH FOREVER!

00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:06.125
NO WAY, NO HOW!
I WON'T QUIT!

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.393
FINE THEN.

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.162
YOU'LL LEARN THE HARD WAY.

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:10.530
IT'S MY TURN!

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:14.234
FIRST, DUE TO
MEFIST'S ABILITY,

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.670
YOU TAKE 300 POINTS OF DAMAGE
FOR EACH CARD ON YOUR FIELD!

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.641
YOU HAVE 3, SO THAT'S
900 PULVERIZING POINTS!

00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.809
LOOK OUT!

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:25.678
I PLAY THE TRAP...!
DOWN BURST!

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:27.714
NOW ALL FACE UP
SPELL AND TRAP CARDS

00:12:27.714 --> 00:12:28.781
THAT ARE OUT
ON YOUR FIELD

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.517
DO AN ABOUT FACE
AND BECOME FACEDOWN!

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.221
THEY WHAT?!
AND THEN I'LL PLAY
ANOTHER TRAP!

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:36.990
DELTA CROW--
ANTI REVERSE!

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.825
NOW, SINCE
A BLACKWING MONSTER

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:40.260
IS FACE UP
ON MY FIELD,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.695
ALL FACEDOWN
SPELL AND TRAP CARDS

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:44.130
ON YOUR FIELD
ARE DESTROYED!

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.900
SO THOSE TWO
YOU JUST FLIPPED
ARE FINISHED!

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.836
AND NOW THAT
I'M TWO TRAP CARDS
LIGHTER...

00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:52.338
THE DAMAGE I TAKE IS
GONNA BE REDUCED...

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:54.073
TO JUST 300!

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.045
THE BEST PART IS...

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.546
NOW THAT WHITEOUT
IS DESTROYED,

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:03.516
THE BOND BETWEEN CROW'S
BLACKWINGS IS RESTORED!

00:13:03.516 --> 00:13:05.451
THOSE WERE SOME
PRETTY CLEVER MOVES.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.987
NOW ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU
SOME OF MY OWN...

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.656
AND I'LL START
BY SUMMONING FORTH

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:12.258
YET ANOTHER OF MY WHITE
WARRIORS--BEHOLD...!

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.727
SLEET...!
THE MORNING STAR!

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.929
BUT THIS SLEET
WON'T BE STICKING,

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:18.064
BECAUSE,
WHEN HE'S RELEASED

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:20.300
AND CRIMSON MEFIST
DESTROYS A MONSTER,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.036
YOU TAKE HALF THAT MONSTER'S
POINTS AS DAMAGE!

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:26.072
BUT THAT MEANS...IF
CRIMSON MEFIST DESTROYS KOCHI,

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:27.840
CROW TAKES
1400 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.542
AND LOSES THE DUEL!

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:33.413
LET HIM HAVE IT,
CRIMSON MEFIST.
ATTACK WITH RANCID RUSH!

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:35.581
OH NO!

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.883
I DON'T THINK SO--
BY SENDIN'

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:38.618
BLACKWING--JETSTREAM
THE BLUE SKY

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:40.219
FROM MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:42.855
I CAN NEGATE
THE DESTRUCTION
OF KOCHI!

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.458
LUCKY...

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.160
WHOA--TALK ABOUT CLOSE!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.263
STRUGGLE ALL YOU LIKE, CROW,
BUT YOUR DEFEAT IS CERTAIN.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:52.131
I END WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:54.267
IT'S MY TURN... BUT IF
I PLAY A FACEDOWN,

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.401
I'LL END UP
TAKING DAMAGE

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.602
AND LOSIN' THE DUEL.

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.771
TO STAND A CHANCE,
I GOTTA SOMEHOW

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:01.074
TAKE DOWN THAT
CRIMSON MEFIST.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.075

00:14:02.075 --> 00:14:04.777

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:12.085
GO CROW!
YOU CAN DO IT!

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:13.586

00:14:19.926 --> 00:14:22.462
YOU'VE TAKEN CARE
OF PEARSON'S KIDS.

00:14:23.496 --> 00:14:24.864

COME ON OVER HERE.
WE WANNA PLAY!

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:30.937
SURE, CROW, IT MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN EASY...

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.473
BUT JUST CHECK OUT THOSE
SMILES ON THEIR FACES.

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:34.674
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:36.075
YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.711
YOU'RE GONNA WIN!
GO, CROW, GO!

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.912

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.398
Yusei: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.867
WAIT...NO WAY...
IS THAT...?!

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:02.535
Crow:
THE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON.

00:15:02.535 --> 00:15:04.804
PEARSON GAVE ME THIS
CARD TO PROTECT THE KIDS

00:15:04.804 --> 00:15:06.339
HE CARED FOR SO MUCH...

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:09.475
SO THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GONNA DO!

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:12.912
MY TURN!

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.416

THESE TWO BLACKWINGS
WILL BEAT AS ONE!

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.196
SOAR TO POWER...

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.268
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON!

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.437
[ROARS]

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:40.173
MY MARK!

00:15:40.173 --> 00:15:41.374
MINE TOO!

00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:43.810
COULD THIS BE
THE SIGNER'S
FIFTH DRAGON?

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:49.816
[LOW GROWL]

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:55.087
Duel runner computer:
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON IS
A LEVEL 8 DRAGON-TYPE MONSTER

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:59.659
WITH 2800 ATTACK POINTS
AND 1600 DEFENSE POINTS.

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.728
SO THE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON'S
FINALLY HERE.

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:05.097
TOO LITTLE,
TOO LATE,
I'M AFRAID.

00:16:05.097 --> 00:16:06.499
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP...

00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:08.034
SYNCHRO RIVALRY!

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:10.503
NOW ON THE TURN YOU SUMMON
A SYNCHRO MONSTER--

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:11.771
LIKE THAT DRAGON...

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.506
NONE OF THE MONSTERS
ON MY FIELD

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:15.641
CAN BE DESTROYED IN BATTLE!

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:18.978
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT--
I PLAY ANGEL BATON!

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.147
NOW, SINCE I HAVE TWO OR
MORE SPEED COUNTERS...

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:23.049
I GET TO DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.851
BUT MUST SEND
ONE CARD IN MY HAND

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.052
TO THE GRAVEYARD!

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:28.955
SO, I SEND BLACKWING--
ZEPHYROS THE ELITE

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:31.491
TO THE GRAVE
AND THEN PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN!

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.259
HAS CROW LOST IT?
IF HE DOES THAT,

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.962
THAT MEANS HIS TURN IS OVER,
AND THEN THAT MEANS...

00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:38.431
CRIMSON MEFIST'S
ABILITY ACTIVATES!

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:40.766
NOW YOU TAKE
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:43.603
FOR EVERY SPELL OR TRAP CARD
YOU HAVE FACEDOWN!

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:46.138

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.390
AND NOW IT WILL
COME TO PASS!

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.325
All: LOOK OUT, CROW!

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:07.727
[GROWLS]

00:17:07.727 --> 00:17:11.664
Crow: ACTUALLY, BLACK-WINGED
DRAGON'S LOOKING OUT FOR ME!

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:12.732
WHAT?

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.600
I PLAY HIS ABILITY!

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.736
NOW, I CAN NEGATE
NON-BATTLE DAMAGE

00:17:16.736 --> 00:17:19.171
BY LOWERIN' BLACK WINGED
DRAGON'S ATTACK POINTS

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.140
BY HOWEVER MUCH
THAT DAMAGE WAS!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.142
IN THIS CASE, 300!

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:25.845
NO WAY! THAT WAS GONNA BE
THE END FOR YOU!

00:17:25.845 --> 00:17:27.547
NOT ANYMORE...

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:29.815
AND NOW BY TAKIN'
400 POINTS OF DAMAGE

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.184
AND RETURNIN' ONE CARD
ON MY FIELD TO MY HAND,

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:33.252
I'M ALLOWED TO SUMMON

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:34.687
BLACKWING ZEPHYROS
THE ELITE

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.389
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.393
BUT INSTEAD OF TAKIN'
THAT 400 POINTS
OF DAMAGE,

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:43.362
I'LL JUST USE MY
DRAGON'S ABILITY AGAIN!

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.464
COOL! IT'S LIKE
HIS BODYGUARD!

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:47.300
ARE YOU DONE, CROW?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.634
NOT EVEN CLOSE,
BOLTON...

00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:51.203
CUZ WHEN ZEPHYROS
IS SUMMONED DUE TO
THIS ABILITY

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:54.040
BY PLACIN'
A CARD FACEDOWN,
IT'S DESTROYED!

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.342
AND SINCE I PLACED
A CARD FACEDOWN,

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.910
I NOW TAKE
DAMAGE FROM

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.545
CRIMSON MEFIST'S
ABILITY...

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:03.282
ONLY, THANKS ONCE
AGAIN TO MY DRAGON'S
ABILITY, I DON'T!

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.383
[GROWLS]

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:05.484
THEN, BY RETURNIN'

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.420
ANOTHER CARD
ON MY FIELD TO MY HAND,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.856
I CAN SUMMON ZEPHYROS
THE ELITE ALL OVER AGAIN!

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:17.597
AND AS BEFORE, I'LL THEN
PLACE A CARD FACEDOWN

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.332
TO DESTROY ZEPHYROS!

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:24.604
IS IT JUST ME, OR IS
THAT DRAGON'S WINGS

00:18:24.604 --> 00:18:26.205
SLOWLY TURNING BLACK?

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.542
YEAH. MORE SO WITH
EVERY HIT IT TAKES.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:30.776
LOOK, CROW...

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:32.345
WHADAYA TRYING TO PROVE?

00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:33.446
I'LL TELL YA WHAT...

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:35.514
THAT PEARSON WAS
JUST LIKE HIS DRAGON.

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.283
HE WOULDN'T HESITATE
TO TAKE THE HITS

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.385
FOR ALL OF US
OVER N' OVER AGAIN.

00:18:39.385 --> 00:18:42.288
CUZ THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING TO HIM WAS US.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.557
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T
TAKE THE MONEY
BACK THEN.

00:18:44.557 --> 00:18:46.092
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT GETTING RICH

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.628
AND BECOMING SOME
HOT-SHOT BUSINESSMAN.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:51.030
CUZ HE WASN'T ANYTHING
LIKE YOU, BOLTON!

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.865
[GASP]

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:56.102
[ROARS]

00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:58.404
NO, BUT...
I JUST...

00:18:58.404 --> 00:19:01.140
WANTED TO MAKE
A FEW GOOD DUEL RUNNERS...

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.410
DID YOU? OR WERE YOU
IN IT FOR YOURSELF?

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.112
YOU SAY YOU CARE
FOR YOUR WORKERS...

00:19:06.112 --> 00:19:08.214
BUT I'VE SEEN WHAT
TRUE CARING IS.

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:09.749
I'VE SEEN IT IN
PEARSON'S EYES.

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:11.917
AND IN THE EYES OF
ALL THE CHILDREN
HE LOOKED AFTER.

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:14.453
IF HE TOOK THAT MONEY,
WHERE WOULD THAT
HAVE LEFT THEM?

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.356
WITHOUT A FUTURE...
WITHOUT HOPE!

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:18.758
[WHIMPERING]

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:20.459
TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:21.894
PEARSON PUT
EVERYONE ELSE FIRST

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.195
AND HIM LAST...

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.665
JUST LIKE THIS DRAGON
IS DOIN' FOR ME NOW.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.100
OVER AND OVER...
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.101
[GASP]

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.603
AND HE EVEN DID IT
WHEN IT MEANT

00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:32.004
HE COULD
LOSE EVERYTHING.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.040
HE DID IT WHEN
YOU STOOD IN HIS WAY.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.741
HE DID IT
FOR THE CHILDREN,

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:38.377
AND HE ENDED UP PAYING
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.546
[ROARS]

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:44.917
AND THAT'S WHY...
HE LOVED THIS CARD...

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.318
BECAUSE IT'S
WILLING TO PAY

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:48.154
THE ULTIMATE PRICE, TOO!

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:50.856
NO! BLACK-WINGED
DRAGON'S OUTTA POINTS!

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.091
DOES THAT MEAN HE'S...?!

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.326
[WEAK ROAR]

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.696
[WORRIED BREATHING]
Crow: BOLTON...

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.999
PEARSON VANISHED AFTER
HIS DUEL WITH YOU...

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.334
BUT THROUGH THE POWER
OF THIS DRAGON,

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.304
HE'S STILL PROTECTING US
EVEN FROM THE NETHERWORLD!

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:08.441
I PLAY BLACK-WINGED
DRAGON'S ABILITY!

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:09.975
NOW THE ATTACK POINTS
OF MY DRAGON

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.577
ARE RETURNED
TO THEIR FULL AMOUNT,

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.412
AND THE ATTACK POINTS
OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:16.015
DECREASE BY ALL
THE DAMAGE HE NEGATED!

00:20:16.015 --> 00:20:19.785
BLACK-WINGED BURST...GO!

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:20.953
[GASP]

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:26.726
[ROARS]

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.327
IT'S A COMPLETE
ROLE REVERSAL,

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.129
NOW BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
HAS ALL THE POWER,

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:32.064
AND CRIMSON MEFIST
HAS NONE!

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.735
NOW, BLACK-WINGED
DRAGON, ATTACK
CRIMSON MEFIST WITH...

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:37.636
SHADOW SQUALL BLAST!

00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:51.484
ALRIGHT!
HE DID IT!
WAY TO GO, CROW!

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:53.786
I TOLD YA HE COULD DO IT!
YEAH!
YOU'RE THE BEST!

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:55.254
WELL DONE.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.338
Bolton: PEARSON...

00:21:12.338 --> 00:21:15.541
YOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG,
AND I WAS WRONG.

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:20.646
I'M SORRY FOR
EVERYTHING I DID TO YOU.

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.248
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD...

00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:24.517
THINGS...WILL CHANGE.

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.021
LET'S HOPE...

00:21:37.897 --> 00:21:39.698
Crow: PEARSON...

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.667
JUST KNOW THAT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE...

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:45.137
THINGS AROUND HERE
HAVE FINALLY BEEN
SET STRAIGHT...

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.807
AND WHEN WE FIND A WAY
TO GET YOU BACK FROM
THE NETHERWORLD...

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:50.442
I'LL HAVE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
WAITIN' FOR YOU...

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.747
ALWAYS.
