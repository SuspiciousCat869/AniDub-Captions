00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:01.840
AND I THINK WE'LL START
WITH INFERNITY BEAST!

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.575
DUE TO THE ABILITY
OF MY BEAST...

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:04.910
OR SHOULD I SAY DRAGON,

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.779
IF I HAVE ZERO CARDS
IN MY HAND, WHICH I DO,

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:10.382
YOU CAN'T ACTIVATE
ANY SPELLS OR TRAPS!

00:09:10.382 --> 00:09:11.449
[GASP]

00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:16.154
HE WANTED TO GET RID
OF HIS CARDS.

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:19.591
NOW THEN... LET'S TRY
THAT ATTACK AGAIN SHALL WE?!

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.794
GO, INFINITY SIGHT STREAM!

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.462

HEY YUSEI!

00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:35.907
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF NEW DANCE CRAZE?

00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:38.410
NOW HANG ON TIGHT.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.346
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU STICK AROUND FOR THIS.

00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:45.116
AFTER ALL, I'VE BEEN DREAMING
OF THIS DAY FOR YEARS, YUSEI!

00:09:45.116 --> 00:09:47.185
AND NOW, I GET TO DEAL YOU
A LITTLE JUSTICE

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.653
YOU BACKSTABBING TRAITOR!

00:09:48.653 --> 00:09:49.754
"BUT KALIN?!"

00:09:51.122 --> 00:09:52.657
BUT NOTHING YUSEI!

00:09:52.657 --> 00:09:54.259
[GRUNTS]

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:56.595
IF THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA BE...

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.763
I DRAW!

00:09:58.763 --> 00:10:00.398
HMMM.

00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:02.801
I SUMMON ROCKSTONE
WARRIOR TO THE FIELD,

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.069
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:09.474
[GRUNTS AND GROWLS]

00:10:09.474 --> 00:10:10.542
PLEASE.

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:12.777
YOU'RE JUST DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

00:10:12.777 --> 00:10:14.779
TELL IT TO MY FACEDOWN.

00:10:14.779 --> 00:10:16.514
YOU'RE UP.

00:10:16.514 --> 00:10:18.350
WELL, NOT THAT
IT MATTERS,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.218
BUT NOW YOU CAN
ATTACK ME NEXT ROUND

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.854
SINCE MY DEPTH AMULET
IS ALL OUT OF POWER.

00:10:22.854 --> 00:10:24.122
OR YOU CAN JUST
KEEP SITTING THERE

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.625
WHILE I KICK YOUR TAIL PIPE
ALL OVER THE SATELLITE!

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:27.692
[THINKING]
KALIN'S RIGHT!

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.628
EVEN MY STARDUST DRAGON
CAN'T TAKE ON

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.029
THAT HUNDRED-EYED THING.

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:32.664
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
DUEL LIKE THIS!

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:36.801
HOW DID HE LOSE SIGHT
OF OUR GOAL?!

00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:38.803
Yusei: I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
WHAT MADE THE DUELIST

00:10:38.803 --> 00:10:40.238
WHO USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:41.773
DECIDE TO CHANGE HIS PATH.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.080
KALIN... PLEASE TELL ME
WHY YOU TURNED
ON ALL OF US.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.684
[SCOFFS] I NEEDED TO FREE
THE KALIN YOU HELD BACK!

00:10:52.684 --> 00:10:54.085
THAT'S A LIE!

00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:56.121
I ONLY TRIED
TO HELP MY FRIEND!

00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:59.457
BECAUSE... YOU CHANGED...

00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.093
[GRUNTS]
YOU CHANGED FIRST.

00:11:02.093 --> 00:11:04.162
WE COULD HAVE CONTROLLED
THE WHOLE CITY.

00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:06.564
IT WAS JUST
THE 4 OF US BACK THEN.

00:11:06.564 --> 00:11:08.900
JACK, YOU, ME, AND CROW...

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.170
WE WERE GOING TO USE OUR DECKS
TO CLEAN UP THE SATELLITE...

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.171
OR DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

00:11:15.373 --> 00:11:17.842
OK, ENFORCERS,
LET'S DO THIS... [SHOUTS]

00:11:21.446 --> 00:11:23.848

LOCKING THEM INTO DUELS

00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:27.385
SO THEY COULDN'T GET AWAY.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:30.088
CRIME WAS DOWN.
PEOPLE FELT SAFE.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:32.390
THE SATELLITE WAS A PLACE
YOU COULD CALL HOME.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.458
ALRIGHT!

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.460
NOW, WHO ELSE
WANTS SOME?!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.595
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHO WE ARE?!

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:39.364
NO ONE CAN BEAT
THE ENFORCERS!

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:42.233
Kalin: EVERY DAY WAS
A DIFFERENT BATTLE,
A DIFFERENT DUEL.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:43.234
[GRUNTS]

00:11:45.136 --> 00:11:46.604
Kalin: THIS WAS A WAR!

00:11:46.604 --> 00:11:48.907
A WAR FOR OUR HOMES,
FAMILIES, AND FRIENDS!

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.175

THE DUEL GANGS GAVE UP.

00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:53.845
THEY COULDN'T HANDLE
THE 4 OF US...

00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:55.780
OUR DECKS, OR OUR DUELING.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.982
ONE BY ONE, THE STREETS
WERE SAFE AGAIN.

00:11:57.982 --> 00:11:59.117
ONE BY ONE,
PEOPLE WERE LEARNING

00:11:59.117 --> 00:12:01.152
THAT THE SATELLITE WAS OUR CITY.

00:12:01.152 --> 00:12:03.688
AND WE WERE GONNA DO
WHAT SECURITY COULDN'T.

00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:05.390
ONE BY ONE, THEY BELIEVED.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.526
UNTIL THERE WAS ONLY ONE LEFT.

00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.395
DOWNTOWN.

00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:12.664
THEY'RE THE LAST DUEL GANG
THAT'S OUT THERE.

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:14.799

DOWN MEMORY LANE

00:12:33.204 --> 00:12:35.173

SEND YOU TO THE NETHWERWORLD!

AND SEND IT
TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:01.981
