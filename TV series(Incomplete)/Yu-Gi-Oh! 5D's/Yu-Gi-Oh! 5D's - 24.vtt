MY TRAP'S EFFECT
CANCELS YOUR DIRECT

THAT TO STOP ME!

00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:53.925
BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE
THE PAIN THAT IT CAUSES
FOREVER, YUSEI.

00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:56.194
I'LL MAKE THEM STOP!

00:08:56.194 --> 00:08:57.362
[THINKING]
I HAVE TO HELP HER

00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:59.598
BEFORE SHE DOES
SOMETHING SHE'LL REGRET.

00:08:59.598 --> 00:09:01.433
IF I SHOW HER THAT
HER POWER IS A GIFT

00:09:01.433 --> 00:09:02.834
AND NOT A CURSE,

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.570
MAYBE SHE'LL STOP
CAUSING ALL THIS PAIN!

00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:10.108
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:09:10.108 --> 00:09:11.109
[THINKING]
NICE!

00:09:11.109 --> 00:09:12.544
WITH PREVENTION STAR,

00:09:12.544 --> 00:09:14.946
I CAN STOP
ONE OF HER MONSTERS
FROM ATTACKING!

00:09:14.946 --> 00:09:16.581
I BETTER HOLD ONTO IT
FOR LATER.

00:09:16.581 --> 00:09:20.118
I GOT A FEELING
THE BIG DOGS ARE
COMIN' OUT SOON!

00:09:20.118 --> 00:09:23.822
I SUMMON JUNK SYNCHRON
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:23.822 --> 00:09:25.891
AND THANKS TO
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.760
SPEED WARRIOR IS
SUMMONED AUTOMATICALLY!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.530
ALL RIGHT! AND NOW SPEED
WARRIOR'S ATTACK POINTS

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.598
GET TRANSFERRED OVER
TO JUNK WARRIOR!

00:09:33.598 --> 00:09:35.667
THAT'S NOT JUST
A "SPECIAL" ABILITY,

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:39.638
THAT'S LIKE A TOTALLY WICKED
DOUBLE-BACKFLIP WITH CHOCOLATE
SPRINKLES ABILITY!

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.076
[THINKING]
STARDUST DRAGON!
PERFECT!

00:09:44.076 --> 00:09:45.811
NOW I TUNE
JUNK SYNCHRON

00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:47.879
WITH MY JUNK WARRIOR!

00:09:56.555 --> 00:10:00.559
MEET MY FRIEND:
STARDUST DRAGOOOOOOOON!

00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:05.030
[ROARING]

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.598
MC: IN ALL MY YEARS OF
BROADCASTING,

00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.234
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MONSTER
LIKE THIS!

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.535
IF YOU'RE WATCHING FROM HOME,

00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:12.537
DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN.

00:10:12.537 --> 00:10:16.141
IT'S AS UNBELIEVABLE
AS IT APPEARS!

00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:17.576
THAT'S HIS DRAGON!

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:19.578
THAT'S THE CARD
JACK GAVE HIM!

00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:21.747
WAIT A SEC!
WHY WOULD YUSEI
BRING OUT A MONSTER

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:23.582
THAT'S WEAKER
THAN HIS WARRIOR?

00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.884
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO SAY SOMETHING

00:10:25.884 --> 00:10:27.519
TO THE BLACK ROSE!

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.354
SHE'S GOT
NO CHANCE NOW!

00:10:29.354 --> 00:10:30.989
LOOK AT THAT!
IT'S HUGE!

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:35.360
NOT BAD.

00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:40.732
EXCELLENT.

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:44.503
TWO DRAGONS?!

00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:47.639
MC: GET READY, PEOPLE!

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.876
THESE TWO DRAGONS
ARE ABOUT TO DO BATTLE!

00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:08.383
Akiza: YOU BROUGHT OUT
THAT DRAGON

00:11:08.383 --> 00:11:09.751
TO REMIND ME
OF ALL THE PAIN

00:11:09.751 --> 00:11:13.221
THAT DETESTABLE MARK
ON MY ARM HAS CAUSED ME?

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:15.457
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

00:11:15.457 --> 00:11:16.725
HUH?

00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:18.326
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE

00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:20.395
THAT BECAUSE WE BOTH
HAVE THIS MARK IN COMMON

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:21.663
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M FEELING

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:22.898
AND WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH?

00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:24.232
I'M JUST SHOWING YOU

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:26.234
YOU'RE NOT AS DIFFERENT
AS YOU THINK!

00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:27.402
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
YOUR ENEMY,

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:29.204
I COULD BE YOUR FRIEND!

00:11:29.204 --> 00:11:32.240
"FRIEND"?
WHO SAYS I WANT A FRIEND?

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.942
WE BOTH HAVE
THESE STUPID MARKS.

00:11:33.942 --> 00:11:34.943
AND NO MATTER WHAT WE DO,

00:11:34.976 --> 00:11:37.779
WE'LL ALWAYS BE OUTCASTS.

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:42.150
GET IT?
OUR FATE IS TO BE ALONE.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.653
MY FAMILY,
MY CLASSMATES,

00:11:44.653 --> 00:11:48.023
EVERYONE I'VE EVER KNOWN,
I'VE HURT.

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.760
THAT'S WHY HAVING FRIENDS
ISN'T A CHOICE.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.329
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN NEVER DO.

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:55.630
AND THAT'S WHY
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.566
TO WEAR A MASK.

00:11:57.566 --> 00:12:00.035
IT'S AMAZING HOW LITTLE
YOU CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:02.771
WHEN YOU CAN LIVE BEHIND
A WALL OF PLASTER AND PAINT,

00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:05.674
EVEN IF IT IS ONLY
THE SIZE OF YOUR FACE.

00:12:05.674 --> 00:12:08.210
AND SO I DUELED WITH IT...

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.480
I WON WITH IT,
AND I LIVED WITH IT.

00:12:14.249 --> 00:12:16.151
SOME HAVE SAID
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON,

00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.086
TO "SHOW MY TRUE FACE
TO THE WORLD,"

00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:21.022
BECAUSE MAYBE THEN PEOPLE
WOULDN'T FEAR MY ABILITIES.

00:12:21.022 --> 00:12:23.558
MAYBE THEN I COULD
LIVE A NORMAL LIFE,

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:25.126
OR AT LEAST
AS CLOSE TO NORMAL

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:27.395
AS PEOPLE LIKE US
CAN GET.

00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:29.831
MAYBE EVEN HAVE A FRIEND.

00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.067
BUT YOU HEARD THE CROWD,
DIDN'T YOU, YUSEI?

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:34.402
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ME.

00:12:34.402 --> 00:12:37.839
80,000 PEOPLE ARE SHOUTING
THEY'RE AFRAID OF ME!

00:12:37.839 --> 00:12:40.075
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!
LISTEN TO ME!

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:41.576
I NEED MY MASK!

00:12:41.576 --> 00:12:44.079
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO HELP ME, YUSEI?

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:45.947
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU!

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:48.016
YOU KNOW WHO?

00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:49.384
THE SCARED GIRL?

00:12:49.384 --> 00:12:51.253
MAYBE THE FACE
BEHIND THE MASK?

00:12:51.253 --> 00:12:53.255
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE THE OUTCAST!

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:55.056
I'M FROM THE SATELLITE!

00:12:55.056 --> 00:12:57.726
YOU THINK PEOPLE HERE
LIKED WHAT THEY SAW
IN ME?!

00:12:57.726 --> 00:12:59.361
YOU CAN'T STAY AFRAID!

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.730
YOU CAN'T HIDE
BEHIND A MASK FOREVER!

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.231
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:05.367
[THINKING]
I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO COME TO THIS, AKIZA,

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:07.869
BUT YOU'VE LEFT ME
NO CHOICE!

00:13:07.869 --> 00:13:11.840
STARDUST DRAGON,
ATTACK WITH
COSMIC FLARE!

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.942
[ROARING]

00:13:13.975 --> 00:13:15.477
UNH!

00:13:15.477 --> 00:13:17.379
OHH!

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.546
[GROAN]

00:13:18.546 --> 00:13:19.848
HUH?
[WHIMPER]

00:13:19.848 --> 00:13:22.017
HEY! YOUR ARM!

00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:23.084
[GRUNT]

00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:28.323
DON'T WEAR THAT MASK!

00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:40.035
SORRY, BUT I'VE ALREADY
MADE MY DECISION.

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.903
I...NEED THE MASK.

00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:44.839
WITHOUT IT,
IT'S TOO EASY TO BE HURT.

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:46.675
NICE MASK!
SCAREDY CAT!

00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:48.310
HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.846
YUSEI. AKIZA'S MINE.

00:13:51.846 --> 00:13:54.316
YOU CAN'T RESCUE HER
FROM FATE.

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:01.790
LISTEN.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.425
NO! YOU LISTEN!

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:08.229
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND I ACTIVATE MAGIC PLANTER.

00:14:08.229 --> 00:14:10.865
SO BY REMOVING
MY IVY SHACKLES FROM PLAY,

00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:14.602
I GET TO PLANT
TWO NEW FACEDOWNS.

00:14:14.602 --> 00:14:18.206
AND NEXT, I'LL PLAY
ONE OF THEM: DARK TUNING!

00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:20.241
FOR THE LOW PRICE
OF 800 LIFE POINTS,

00:14:20.241 --> 00:14:21.509
I CAN SUMMON
ANY SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:23.311
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:27.882
AND I'M BRINGING BACK
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.755
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET,

00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:37.592
BECAUSE NOW I CAN EQUIP
WICKED REBORN TO MY DRAGON.

00:14:37.592 --> 00:14:40.128
SHE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO ATTACK THIS TURN,

00:14:40.128 --> 00:14:42.230
BUT AS LONG AS
SHE'S EQUIPPED WITH THIS CARD,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.401
BLACK ROSE DRAGON CAN BE
RE-SUMMONED AT THE END
OF EACH AND EVERY ROUND.

00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:48.737
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU
IN THE BACK OF THE CLASS,

00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:50.972
THAT MEANS IF IT'S EVER
DESTROYED IN BATTLE

00:14:50.972 --> 00:14:52.774
OR BY SOME SPECIAL SPELL,

00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:54.275
IT COMES BACK
AS GOOD AS NEW

00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:56.144
AT THE END OF MY TURN.
HUH!

00:14:56.144 --> 00:14:58.713
OH, AND LAST
BUT NOT LEAST,

00:14:58.713 --> 00:15:01.015
WHEN BLACK ROSE DRAGON
IS SPECIAL SUMMONED,

00:15:01.015 --> 00:15:03.752
ALL THE CARDS
ON YOUR FIELD ARE DESTROYED.

00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.955
SO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR PATHETIC PET!

00:15:06.955 --> 00:15:08.523
[GROANING]

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.160
HOLD ON TIGHT!

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.595
STAY TOGETHER!

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:14.929
[YELLING]

00:15:14.929 --> 00:15:16.231
[THINKING]
YUSEI!

00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:17.832
[THINKING]
I GOTTA STOP THIS!

00:15:17.832 --> 00:15:20.902
I ACTIVATE STARDUST'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:22.871
IT MIGHT BE
A BIG PRICE TO PAY,

00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:24.706
BUT SACRIFICING
MY DRAGON

00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:28.009
DESTROYS YOURS
AND ALL OF ITS POWERS.

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:30.478
IT'S A DRAGON,
FOR A DRAGON!

00:15:30.478 --> 00:15:31.746
[ROARING]

00:15:43.825 --> 00:15:45.527
LOOK! HE STOPPED HER!

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:49.564
BUT HE LOST
STARDUST DRAGON!
WHAT NOW?!

00:15:49.564 --> 00:15:52.066
YOUR HEART
WILL BE YOUR UNDOING.

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:54.369
YOU MAY HAVE RID
THE FIELD OF MY DRAGON,

00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:57.038
BUT LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE
PHOENIXIAN SEED!

00:15:57.038 --> 00:16:00.875
AND SINCE WE'RE
SACRIFICING CARDS TO
ACTIVATE SPECIAL ABILITIES,

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:05.547
I'LL SOW MY SEED TO REAP
PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER AMARYLLIS!

00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:11.853
Computer: WHEN THE MONSTER CARD
PHOENIXIAN CLUSTER AMARYLLIS

00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:13.054
IS IN YOUR GRAVEYARD,

00:16:13.054 --> 00:16:15.056
IT IS AUTOMATICALLY RE-SUMMONED
IN DEFENSE MODE

00:16:15.056 --> 00:16:16.658
AT THE END OF YOUR TURN.

00:16:16.658 --> 00:16:19.594
AND BEFORE YOU START
IN AGAIN WITH
"DON'T DUEL IN ANGER,"

00:16:19.594 --> 00:16:24.065
LET'S SEE IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR TUNE AFTER I DESTROY
ANOTHER OF YOUR MONSTERS?

00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:26.401
AMARYLLIS, ATTACK!

00:16:28.236 --> 00:16:29.437
[GRUNTING]

00:16:29.437 --> 00:16:30.972
BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE,

00:16:30.972 --> 00:16:32.540
BECAUSE ONCE
AMARYLLIS ATTACKS,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.842
IT SELF-DESTRUCTS,

00:16:33.842 --> 00:16:36.211
CAUSING ANOTHER
800 POINTS IN DAMAGE.

00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:37.612
THIS SHOULD HURT A LITTLE.

00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:39.414
AAH!

00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:40.915
TOLD YA.

00:16:45.453 --> 00:16:47.822
[CHUCKLE]

00:16:47.822 --> 00:16:50.692
I'LL END WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:53.528
THIS ROUND'S NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO BEING OVER,
AKIZA!

00:16:53.528 --> 00:16:56.564
REMEMBER: I USED
STARDUST DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:16:56.564 --> 00:16:59.033
AND THAT MEANS
HE COMES BACK!

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:00.468
WELL, THEN,
I GUESS OUR TWO BEASTS

00:17:00.468 --> 00:17:02.270
WILL HAVE TO
BATTLE IT OUT AGAIN!

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.707
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR END!

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.353
I RE-SUMMON
BLACK ROSE DRAGON!

00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:28.256
AND WITH IT ON THE FIELD,

00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:30.091
I NOW ACTIVATE MY TRAP:

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:31.893
OVERDOOM LINE!

00:17:31.893 --> 00:17:34.896
SO NOW THE MONSTER I JUST
SUMMONED FROM MY GRAVEYARD

00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:38.332
GAINS 1,000
ATTACK POINTS!

00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:40.101
AND TO KEEP MY DRAGON
COMPANY,

00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:42.703
I'M ACTIVATING AMARYLLIS'
SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:45.506
WHICH ALSO ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON IT
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.642
IT'S YOUR TURN, YUSEI.

00:17:47.642 --> 00:17:49.210
I DRAW, THEN...

00:17:50.578 --> 00:17:52.180
[THINKING]
COSMIC BLAST.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.348
NOW IF MY DRAGON
EVER LEAVES THE FIELD,

00:17:54.348 --> 00:17:56.818
IT CAN STILL
DEAL DAMAGE TO AKIZA!

00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:59.754
I KNOW THE ONLY WAY
TO HELP HER
IS TO DEFEAT HER,

00:17:59.754 --> 00:18:03.658
AND I'M STARTING TO SEE
JUST THE COMBO TO DO IT!

00:18:03.658 --> 00:18:05.993
I TAKE
MY STARDUST DRAGON

00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:08.096
AND SWITCH IT
TO DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:08.096 --> 00:18:11.466
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
THE SPELL
PREVENTION STAR.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.168
AND SINCE
MY STARDUST DRAGON
IS IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:18:14.168 --> 00:18:18.506
I CAN EQUIP THE POWER OF
PREVENTION STAR TO IT.

00:18:18.506 --> 00:18:21.008
AND NOW I GET TO PREVENT
ONE OF YOUR MONSTERS

00:18:21.008 --> 00:18:24.812
FROM ATTACKING
OR CHANGING
ITS BATTLE POSITION!

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.280
AND I THINK
I'LL FREEZE UP

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.250
YOUR PHOENIXIAN
CLUSTER AMARYLLIS!

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.354
AWESOME!

00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:35.289
YUSEI NEVER WOULD HAVE
SURVIVED ANOTHER ROUND

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:37.959
WITH AKIZA'S AMARYLLIS
STILL IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:41.129
NOW LET'S SEE
IF HE CAN TURN
THIS DUEL AROUND!

00:18:41.129 --> 00:18:43.664
I PLAY THE TRAP CARD
SYNCHRO BACK!

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.267
NOW, BY REMOVING
ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER
FROM MY FIELD,

00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:48.569
I CAN RE-SUMMON IT
NEXT TURN.

00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:52.573
AND WHO BETTER
THAN MY BLACK ROSE DRAGON,
YUSEI?

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:56.277
WHAT'D SHE DO?

00:18:56.277 --> 00:18:57.345
DON'T YOU GET IT,
GRAMPS?

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.480
WHEN SHE SPECIAL SUMMONS
HER DRAGON NEXT ROUND,

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:00.982
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY
ACTIVATES,

00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:03.084
DESTROYING
ALL OF YUSEI'S CARDS!

00:19:03.084 --> 00:19:05.853
YEAH! SO SHE'LL
TAKE OUT YUSEI'S
STARDUST DRAGON,

00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:08.489
AND THAT'LL
LEAVE HIM WIDE OPEN
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:19:08.489 --> 00:19:10.925
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE CAN DO
TO BEAT AKIZA, GUYS!

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:12.493
[GASPING]

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:15.596
I'LL END
BY THROWIN' DOWN
A FACEDOWN.

00:19:15.596 --> 00:19:17.165
IT WON'T HELP YOU!

00:19:17.165 --> 00:19:18.432
[GRUNT]

00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:20.635
BECAUSE THANKS TO
MY SYNCHRO BACK'S EFFECT,

00:19:20.635 --> 00:19:23.104
BLACK ROSE DRAGON
COMES BACK TO THE FIELD!

00:19:27.642 --> 00:19:29.777
[GROANING]

00:19:29.777 --> 00:19:31.212
IT'S YOUR SIGN!

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.314
I WISH IT WAS GONE!

00:19:33.314 --> 00:19:35.316
BUT IT'S A PART OF YOU!

00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:37.418
IT'S PART OF ALL OF US!

00:19:37.418 --> 00:19:40.087
HAVING THIS MARK
DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A WITCH, AKIZA,

00:19:40.087 --> 00:19:41.822
IT MAKES YOU SPECIAL!

00:19:41.822 --> 00:19:43.324
I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE
DON'T SEE THAT,

00:19:43.324 --> 00:19:44.725
AND I KNOW IT HURTS.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.160
BUT WHEN YOU
GET ANGRY AT THEM,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.197
YOU'RE ONLY HATING
YOURSELF!

00:19:49.197 --> 00:19:50.565
THE PAIN YOU FEEL
FROM THAT MARK

00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:52.600
IS SHARED BY ME
AS WELL.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.236
IT'S TRYING TO
BRING US TOGETHER,
TO STRENGTHEN US.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.504
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT YET,

00:19:56.537 --> 00:19:59.407
BUT THIS PAIN IS
SOMEHOW UNITING US.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:02.143
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IT WANTS, AKIZA!

00:20:02.143 --> 00:20:04.645
BUT FIRST,
YOU MUST REALIZE
THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE,

00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:07.381
THAT WE'RE CONNECTED,
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED.

00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:09.717
WE'RE ALL GOING TO
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

00:20:09.717 --> 00:20:11.219
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO BAND TOGETHER

00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:13.654
IN ORDER FOR THIS
TO ALL MAKE SENSE.

00:20:13.654 --> 00:20:15.256
EMBRACE YOUR DRAGON!

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.624
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,

00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:18.492
JUST LIKE YOU ARE
UNDER THAT MASK.

00:20:18.526 --> 00:20:20.194
I'M NOT BEAUTIFUL.

00:20:20.194 --> 00:20:21.896
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME.

00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:23.998
AND IT'S THIS MARK
THAT'S CAUSED
ALL THE SUFFERING

00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:25.266
I'VE HAD TO LIVE THROUGH.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.467
YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:28.502
BUT IF YOU STAY MAD,
YOU'LL ALWAYS SUFFER!

00:20:28.536 --> 00:20:31.072
[GASP]
SO JUST ACCEPT IT?

00:20:31.072 --> 00:20:35.409
EMBRACE IT?
FORGET THE PAST?!

00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:38.579
HATE'S ALL I KNOW!

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:40.815
THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER.

00:20:40.815 --> 00:20:44.485
I ACTIVATE
BLACK ROSE DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.855
[SHOUTING]

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.025
ALL YOUR CARDS
ARE DESTROYED,

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:52.860
ALONG WITH THIS STADIUM!

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.829
I WON'T LET YOU
DO THIS!

00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:58.299
I USE: MY DRAGON'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.967
I'LL SACRIFICE HIM,

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.436
TO STOP
THIS DESTRUCTION!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:09.210
STOP FIGHTING, AKIZA!

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.645
IT'S OVER!

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:13.581
THE DRAGON INSIDE YOU
WASN'T MEANT TO DESTROY!

00:21:21.956 --> 00:21:23.424
SHE'S GONE.

00:21:23.424 --> 00:21:25.893
BLACK ROSE DRAGON'S GONE.

00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:28.496
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE FINISHED HERE, YUSEI.

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:30.264
PREVENTION STAR'S
GONE, TOO,

00:21:30.264 --> 00:21:32.566
WHICH MEANS AMARYLLIS
CAN NOW ATTACK.

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:34.802
BUT YOU STILL HAVE
THAT FACEDOWN, YUSEI,
DON'T YOU?

00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:36.604
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL IT BE ENOUGH?

00:21:36.604 --> 00:21:38.773
YOU'VE WASTED YOUR TIME
TRYING TO SAVE ME,

00:21:38.773 --> 00:21:43.244
NOW ITS TIME TO SEE
IF YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF.

00:21:43.244 --> 00:21:45.746
LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN STOP ME!

00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:47.248
I NEVER WANTED
TO STOP YOU,

00:21:47.248 --> 00:21:48.449
I WANTED TO SAVE YOU.

00:21:48.449 --> 00:21:49.450
HUH?

00:21:51.018 --> 00:21:53.788
AND I INTEND TO
WITH COSMIC BLAST!

00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:56.157
NOW, BECAUSE
STARDUST DRAGON
LEFT THE FIELD,

00:21:56.157 --> 00:21:58.659
YOU LOSE LIFE POINTS
FOR ALL OF ITS
ATTACK POINTS.

00:21:58.659 --> 00:21:59.760
YOU WOULD'VE
SEEN IT COMING

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.263
IF YOU WEREN'T HIDING
BEHIND THAT MASK.

00:22:11.272 --> 00:22:12.273
OHH!

00:22:12.273 --> 00:22:13.274
OH.

00:22:16.744 --> 00:22:17.945
[GASP]

00:22:17.945 --> 00:22:19.180
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.549
THE BLACK ROSE IS CRYING.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.883
AKIZA!

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.219
Sayer:
IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:29.256
I THINK YOU'VE CAUSED ENOUGH
DAMAGE FOR ONE DAY, MR. FUDO.

00:22:29.256 --> 00:22:32.093
AKIZA'S COMING HOME
WITH ME.

00:22:32.093 --> 00:22:34.195
IT'S OKAY. YOU TRIED.

00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:36.030
NEXT TIME,
YOU'LL DO BETTER.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.998
ALL RIGHT!
SHE LOST!

00:22:37.998 --> 00:22:40.101
DON'T FORGET
YOUR MASK!

00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:44.605
MC: THE WINNER OF THE DUEL IS
YUSEIIIIIII FUUUUUDOOOOOOOO!

00:22:50.578 --> 00:22:52.413
[THINKING]
THANK YOU, YUSEI.
