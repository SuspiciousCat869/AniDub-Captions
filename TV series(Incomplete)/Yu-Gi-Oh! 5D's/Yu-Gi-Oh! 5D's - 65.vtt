00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:44.657

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:04.116
Yusei: IT'S GO TIME!

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.218
Duel Runner Computer:
FORMULATING CROSS-TOWN
DUEL COURSE

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:10.022
AND AWAITING
CENTRAL GRID AUTHORITY'S
OFFICIAL AUTHORIZATION...

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.058
AUTHORIZATION GRANTED.

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:15.761
COMBAT LANE
TRANSFIGURATION UNDERWAY.

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:19.131
COMBAT LANE
TRANSFIGURATION UNDERWAY.

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.943
LET'S REV IT UP!

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.178
ME FIRST!

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:35.014
AND I THINK I'LL SUMMON
WISE CORE FROM MY HAND!

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.786
Duel Runner Computer:
WISE CORE IS A LEVEL ONE

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.989
DARK ATTRIBUTE
MACHINE TYPE MONSTER

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:46.325
WITH ZERO ATTACK POINTS
AND ZERO DEFENSE POINTS.

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:49.595
THEN, I'LL PLACE
ONE CARD FACEDOWN
TO END MY TURN.

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:52.064
A MONSTER WITH
ZERO ATTACK POINTS?

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.466
MY TURN NOW!

00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:57.837
YOU MAY NOT CARE
FOR ATTACK POINTS,

00:18:57.837 --> 00:19:02.108
BUT I TEND TO LIKE THEM,
COME ON OUT MAX WARRIOR!

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:03.209
[ROARS]

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:05.911
NOW, MAX WARRIOR,
ATTACK WISE CORE!

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.248
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
WHEN MAX WARRIOR ATTACKS,

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:12.351
HE GAINS 400 POINTS
TO HELP WITH HIS ASSAULT!

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:13.819
NOW LET HIM HAVE IT!

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.988
NO, HE'LL KEEP IT
BECAUSE I ACTIVATE

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.990
THE TRAP LABYRINTH OF KLINE!

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.626
THIS MAKES ALL BATTLE DAMAGE
FOR THE TURN BECOME ZERO

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:23.362
AND KEEPS ANY MONSTERS
FROM GETTING DESTROYED!

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:26.666
BUT THERE'S MORE, THE MONSTER
THAT WAGED THE ATTACK

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.601
NOW HAS HIS
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS

00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.137
SWAPPED WITH HIS
ORIGINAL DEFENSE POINTS!

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.741
HE'S PROTECTING
THAT WISE CORE...

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:38.010
BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHY?

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.013
OH, WELL.
IF I DESTROY IT,
IT WON'T MATTER,

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.983
WHICH IS WHY
I'M GONNA SPECIAL SUMMON
TURBO BOOSTER!

00:19:43.983 --> 00:19:47.119
YA SEE, SINCE I SUCCESSFULLY
SUMMONED A MONSTER THIS TURN,

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:50.523
I'M NOW ALLOWED TO SPECIAL
SUMMON TURBO BOOSTER
FROM MY HAND.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.957
HE WON'T HANG AROUND FOR LONG,

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.727
BUT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO TAKE DOWN YOUR WISE CORE!

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:57.563
THAT'S RIGHT, SINCE HE
MIXED IT UP WITH MAX WARRIOR,

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.598
HE'S FAIR GAME TO TAKE DOWN!

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.505
WHY THANK YOU.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:08.641
FOOL, DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:11.410
WHEN WISE CORE IS
DESTROYED DUE TO AN EFFECT,

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.213
ALL MONSTERS ON MY FIELD
ARE DESTROYED,

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:15.448
BUT I THEN GET TO SUMMON

00:20:15.448 --> 00:20:18.084
MACHINE EMPEROR
WISEL INFINITY,

00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:21.220
WISEL TOP,
WISEL ATTACK,

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.023
WISEL GUARD,
AND WISEL CARRIER

00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:26.258
FROM MY DECK OR MY HAND!

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:28.861
IMPOSSIBLE! 5 MONSTERS
SUMMONED AT ONCE?!

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:31.297
THAT DEPENDS ON
HOW YOU LOOK AT IT!

00:20:31.297 --> 00:20:33.132
I ACTIVATE
THE SPECIAL ABILITY

00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:35.634
OF MACHINE EMPEROR
WISEL INFINITY!

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:00.860
[GHOST LAUGHS]

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.328
HUH?

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:05.431
FROM 5 COMES ONE,
AND NOW YOU'RE DONE!

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:08.300
UH-OH...
SO MUCH FOR PAYBACK!
