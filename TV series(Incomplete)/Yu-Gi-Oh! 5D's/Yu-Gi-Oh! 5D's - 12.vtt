00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:47.311
HERE WE GO!

00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.715
TIME TO REV IT UP!

00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.955
I SUMMON: SPEED WARRIOR
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:02.593
[GROWL AND ROAR]

00:10:02.593 --> 00:10:04.895
NOW CHECK THIS OUT, OFFICER:

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.331
MY WARRIOR'S ATTACK POINTS
ARE DOUBLED!

00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:09.433
HA!
WHAT A WASTE YUSEI!

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:13.137
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD:
POWER BIND!

00:10:13.137 --> 00:10:16.407
NOW, SPEED WARRIOR
CAN'T ATTACK UNTIL NEXT TURN.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:19.143
AND UNTIL THEN, HIS ATTACK
POINTS ARE ZERO!

00:10:19.143 --> 00:10:21.579
KINDA LIKE YOUR CHANCES OF
GETTING OUTTA THIS DUEL

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.948
WITHOUT A ONE-WAY TICKET
BACK TO THE FACILITY!

00:10:23.948 --> 00:10:26.417
SORRY, SATELLITE, BUT THAT
RUNNER'S STAYIN' PUT!

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:29.486
[LAUGHS]
BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT,

00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:32.056
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
CRUSH IT INTO A CUBE.

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:33.390
I'LL BE SURE TO
TAKE PICTURES SO YOU CAN

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.625
HANG 'EM IN YOUR CELL!

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.328
WHOA, HE SURE DOESN'T
LIKE YOU!

00:10:37.328 --> 00:10:39.263
IF YOU THINK IT'S
BAD NOW WAIT UNTIL

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:42.433
I PLAY THIS...
REACTOR POD!

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.735
A SPEED SPELL!

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.804
AND NOT JUST ANY SPEED SPELL:

00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:48.238
THIS ONE MAKES YOU TAKE DAMAGE

00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:51.375
FOR SPEED WARRIOR'S
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS!

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:53.277
Blister: WOW, YOU REMIND ME
SO MUCH OF AERO.

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.479
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING
THAT GUY THROWS YOUR WAY.

00:10:55.479 --> 00:10:57.047
WELL I'M SURE
AERO WASN'T SCARED

00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:58.949
BECAUSE HE HAD YOU
AS HIS TEAMMATE.

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:01.051
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW

00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:03.153
HAVING YOU
AS MY WINGMAN BLISTER!

00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:04.154

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:08.892
[GROWL]
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?!

00:11:08.892 --> 00:11:11.028
OR IS THAT ALL FOR NOW?!

00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:14.098
I'M JUST GONNA PLAY
A FACEDOWN TRUDGE.

00:11:14.098 --> 00:11:16.266
'BOUT TIME!
NOW I DRAW!

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.536
AND DON'T FORGET, PUNK...

00:11:19.536 --> 00:11:22.439
SPEED WARRIOR'S GOT
ZERO ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.541
WHICH MEANS HE SHOULD
BE EASY PICKIN'S!

00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:26.443
SEARCH STRIKER, ATTACK!

00:11:26.443 --> 00:11:27.444
[GRUNT]

00:11:28.946 --> 00:11:31.148
Yusei: NOT SO FAST!

00:11:31.148 --> 00:11:34.985
I PLAY MY TRAP:
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:11:36.253 --> 00:11:37.588
SORRY, TRUDGE!

00:11:37.588 --> 00:11:39.256
NOT ONLY IS YOUR
ATTACK CANCELLED,

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:42.426
BUT I GET TO PLACE
MY SCARECROW FACEDOWN AGAIN!

00:11:42.426 --> 00:11:44.795
YOU'LL HAVE TO TRY
HARDER THAN THAT!

00:11:44.795 --> 00:11:46.964
IS THIS WHAT
YOU HAD IN MIND?

00:11:46.964 --> 00:11:49.199
I PLAY FINAL COUNTDOWN!

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:50.367
AND THIS CARD'S
ALL ABOUT

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:52.336
GIVING SOMETHING
TO GET SOMETHING.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.571
THE MORE FACEDOWN CARDS
I SEND TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:56.707
THE MORE LIFE POINTS
YOU LOSE!

00:11:56.707 --> 00:12:01.478
500 FOR ONE, 1,500 FOR 3,
AND 3,000 FOR 4!

00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:04.415
AND LAST I CHECKED,
YOU HAVE 1,400 LIFE POINTS.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.784
SO BY SENDING
3 FACEDOWNS TO MY GRAVE,

00:12:06.784 --> 00:12:08.786
YOU LOSE THE DUEL
AND I WIN!

00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:10.888
I GOT ONE FACEDOWN
OUT THERE ALREADY,

00:12:10.888 --> 00:12:12.623
AND COME NEXT TURN,
I'M GOING TO THROW DOWN

00:12:12.623 --> 00:12:14.391
2 MORE AND MAKE 3!

00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:16.026
AND AFTER THAT YUSEI...

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:18.062
IT'S GAME OVER SATELLITE!

00:12:18.062 --> 00:12:21.832
YOU GOT ONE TURN LEFT,
MAKE IT COUNT!

00:12:21.832 --> 00:12:25.102
I JUST DON'T SEE HOW
YOU CAN WIN THIS DUEL NOW YUSEI.

00:12:25.102 --> 00:12:26.637
NO MATTER HOW FAST
YOU TRY AND GO

00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:28.338
YOU CAN'T OUTRUN
THAT CARD'S EFFECT.

00:12:29.807 --> 00:12:32.643
OH NO?
JUST WATCH!

00:12:32.643 --> 00:12:36.146
LISTEN UP SPEED WARRIOR,
IT'S TIME FOR SOME DEFENSE!

00:12:36.146 --> 00:12:39.249
AND NEXT I'M SUMMONING OUT
HEALING WAVE GENERATOR,

00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:42.252
TO HELP GENERATE
A LITTLE MORE D

00:12:42.252 --> 00:12:44.221
Duel runner computer:

AND YOU GAIN LIFE POINTS
EQUAL TO THAT MONSTER'S LEVEL

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:50.294

00:12:50.294 --> 00:12:53.063
Yusei: NOW THANKS TO MY

I CHOOSE MY

00:12:55.699 --> 00:12:57.101
SO THAT I CAN GIVE

00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.136
A 200-POINT BOOST!

00:12:59.136 --> 00:13:00.437
N'WITH THAT BONUS,
IT LOOKS LIKE

00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:02.773
YOU'LL NEED 4 FACEDOWNS
TO WIN THIS.

00:13:02.773 --> 00:13:05.175
AND I DON'T PLAN
ON LETTING THAT HAPPEN!

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:07.745

I'D CALL THAT COMBO

00:13:13.484 --> 00:13:15.586
I JUST HOPE YOU
PULL THIS OFF YUSEI!

Yusei: ME TOO!

00:13:17.054 --> 00:13:19.656
I PLAY 2 FACEDOWNS
AND END MY TURN!

00:13:19.656 --> 00:13:21.625
Trudge:
ALRIGHT THEN, MY MOVE!

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:25.129
AND I SUMMON
THE TUNER MONSTER: TORAPART!

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:28.031
AND NOW I TUNE MY TORAPART
AND MY SEARCH STRIKER

00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:31.435
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO
SUMMON... GOYO GUARDIAN!

00:13:34.605 --> 00:13:36.373

SEE WITH TORAPART
IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:13:59.163 --> 00:14:01.031
YOU CAN'T TRIGGER
YOUR TRAP THIS ROUND.

00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:03.133

SCRAP IRON SCARECROW'S

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.369
SCARING NOTHING AWAY...

OUTSMARTING
A SMART-ALLIC!

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:53.550
'CAUSE IF YOU GO DOWN,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.419

FRIENDS MAY GET YOU THROUGH
YOUR DAY IN THE SATELLITE,

00:15:25.455 --> 00:15:27.424
BUT OVER HERE,
THEY JUST GET IN THE WAY.

00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:31.094
I KNOW YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

00:15:31.094 --> 00:15:33.997
I SAW
THE CARD BLISTER...

00:15:33.997 --> 00:15:36.967
THE ONE THAT AERO
RESCUED FROM YOUR LAST RACE.

00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:37.968
REMEMBER?

00:15:41.538 --> 00:15:42.906
STOP IT!

00:15:42.906 --> 00:15:44.641
HE GAVE ME THAT CARD
TO REMIND ME

00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:46.476
THAT I FAILED
OUR FRIENDSHIP!

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.478
YOU'RE WRONG.
HUH?

00:15:48.478 --> 00:15:50.480
HE GAVE YOU THAT CARD.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.582
AS A SYMBOL
OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP!

00:15:52.582 --> 00:15:54.484
AND NO MATTER
WHAT ROADS YOUR 2 LIVES

00:15:54.484 --> 00:15:56.653
MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
SINCE THAT DAY...

00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:57.921
HE'S STILL YOUR FRIEND.

00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:03.360
AERO DOESN'T BLAME YOU
FOR THE ACCIDENT,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.728
HE BLAMES HIMSELF!

00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:07.331
HE PROBABLY THOUGHT IF HE ONLY
SUPPORTED YOU A LITTLE MORE,

00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:10.267
HE COULD'VE BEEN BY YOUR SIDE
ALL THE WAY TO THE PRO LEAGUE.

00:16:10.267 --> 00:16:12.002
IT'S NOT THAT
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GO,

00:16:12.002 --> 00:16:14.137
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GO ALONE!

00:16:14.137 --> 00:16:16.206
SO HE GAVE YOU
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED:

00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:18.408
THE CARD THAT FUSED
YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:16:18.408 --> 00:16:19.476
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:20.777
BECAUSE WITHOUT
HIS BEST FRIEND,

00:16:20.777 --> 00:16:22.879
HE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT DUELING ANYMORE.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:24.181
BUT IF YOU EVER NEEDED HELP,

00:16:24.181 --> 00:16:27.284
YOU KNOW AERO WOULD BE THERE
WITHOUT A SECOND TO WASTE.

00:16:27.284 --> 00:16:30.053
WHATEVER YOU THINK,
THERE'S ONE THING IN AERO

00:16:30.053 --> 00:16:33.423
THAT HASN'T CHANGED:
HE'S YOUR FRIEND.

00:16:33.423 --> 00:16:35.425
I...DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:38.862
JUST ONE THING: THAT
I'M YOUR FRIEND AS WELL.

00:16:38.862 --> 00:16:40.530
[GRUNT]

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.798
IT'S MY MOVE!

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:45.702

[GROWL]

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:51.308
AND THE BONUS OF HAVING
A TUNER MONSTER OUT THERE

00:16:51.308 --> 00:16:54.811
IS THAT QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
COMES BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:16:54.811 --> 00:16:58.181
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TAKE
THIS BATTLE TO THE NEXT LEVEL!

00:16:58.181 --> 00:17:00.283
NOW TURBO SYNCHRON!

00:17:00.283 --> 00:17:02.552
TAKE OUT HIS
HEALING WAVE GENERATOR!

00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:04.254
WHAT?! HE DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE

00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:05.389
AGAINST
THAT MONSTER!

00:17:05.389 --> 00:17:06.690
WHAT ARE ALL THOSE
DIESEL FUMES

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.458
CHOKING ALL YOUR
BRAIN CELLS?!

00:17:08.458 --> 00:17:10.327
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE
THIS ONE SATELLITE!

00:17:10.327 --> 00:17:12.195
[GRUNTING, GROWLING]

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.701
TOLD YA!

00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:20.003
AND NOW YOU'RE DOWN
TO 100 LIFE POINTS!

00:17:20.003 --> 00:17:21.438
NICE KNOWIN' YA!

00:17:21.438 --> 00:17:24.074
Yusei: WHY? YOU PLANNIN'
ON GOIN' SOMEWHERE?

00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:26.476
OR DID YOU FORGET THAT
WHEN TURBO SYNCHRON ATTACKS,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.379
EVEN IF HE LOSES, I CAN
SUMMON ANOTHER MONSTER.

00:17:29.379 --> 00:17:31.648
AND I GOT JUST THE ONE IN MIND!

00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:34.484
I DIDN'T USE HER IN OUR
LAST MATCH IN THE PIPELINE:

00:17:34.484 --> 00:17:36.186
SONIC CHICK, SAY HELLO!

00:17:37.988 --> 00:17:41.458
NEXT I PLAY MY TRAP CARD:
URGENT TUNING!

00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:43.493
Duel runner computer:
URGENT TUNING IS A TRAP CARD

00:17:43.493 --> 00:17:44.761
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RELEASE

00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:46.663
THE REQUIRED MONSTERS
ON YOUR FIELD

00:17:46.663 --> 00:17:49.699
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
DURING THE BATTLE PHASE.

00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:52.669
Yusei: SO NOW BY COMBINING
ALL THE MONSTERS ON MY FIELD,

00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:54.704
I CAN USE THEIR BOND
TO BRING ABOUT A BEAST

00:17:54.704 --> 00:17:56.239
