AND I'M ENDING IT.

00:09:22.007 --> 00:09:23.074
LISTEN!

00:09:23.074 --> 00:09:24.376
TO WHAT?!
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ME

00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:25.677
OUT OF THIS, YUSEI!

00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:27.345

YOU DON'T KNOW
THE TRUTH 'BOUT ME.

Crow, voice-over:
I NEVER HAD A FAMILY.

00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:38.256
I NEVER HAD TO DO CHORES
OR GO TO SLEEP EARLY.

00:09:38.256 --> 00:09:39.391
NOW I KNOW THAT
LIVING WITHOUT RULES

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.393
MIGHT SOUND LIKE FUN,
BUT ROUND HERE,

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:42.894
IT WAS DANGEROUS.

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:45.764
I LEARNED THAT THE ONLY PERSON
I COULD DEPEND ON WAS ME.

00:09:45.764 --> 00:09:47.365
AND THE WORLD CAN BE
A LONELY PLACE

00:09:47.365 --> 00:09:49.968
WHEN YOUR ONLY COMPANY
IS YOUR SHADOW.

00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:51.803

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:53.772
THESE WERE THE THINGS
I DREAMED ABOUT.

00:09:53.772 --> 00:09:55.907
BUT BECOMING
A PROFESSIONAL DUELIST

00:09:55.907 --> 00:09:57.475
IS WHAT I HOPED FOR THE MOST!

00:09:57.475 --> 00:10:00.145
AND SO I TRIED TO MAKE
MY DREAM A REALITY:

00:10:00.145 --> 00:10:01.546
I FIGURED IF
I COULD BUILD A DECK,

00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:05.050
I MIGHT WIN A FEW DUELS
AND SCORE MY WAY
OUTTA SATELLITE.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:06.351
SO I HIT THE DUMP.

00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:08.253
IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE
WHERE A KID FROM THE STREETS

00:10:08.253 --> 00:10:09.688
COULD HOPE TO FIND
A CARD OR TWO.

OUT OF HERE...

THEY'D TAKE MY CARDS,

EVER STEAL THAT.

YOUR FIRST CARD

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:57.402

EVERYTHING WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.460
BUT DUELING GAVE ME
A NEW BEGINNING.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.962

TO LET ANYONE ELSE

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:31.937
TO TEACH OTHERS THE SAME.

00:11:33.338 --> 00:11:35.607
I FOUND KIDS THAT WERE LIKE ME:

ONES THAT HAD NO FAMILY OR
DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO

TAUGHT THEM HOW TO DUEL.

00:11:43.882 --> 00:11:46.818
AND TOGETHER WE LEARNED
THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON:

00:11:46.818 --> 00:11:49.321
WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS,
YOU'RE NEVER ALONE.

00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:51.289
THEY WERE MY FAMILY, YUSEI.

THAT I SAVED THEM,

IT WAS THEM WHO SAVED ME.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.566
[THINKING] AND IF IT GETS
ANY CLOSER I'M AFRAID CROW

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:21.002
MIGHT NOT BE AROUND
FOR A VICTORY LAP.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.173
ARE YOU READY TO TAKE
THIS DUEL UP A NOTCH?

00:17:25.173 --> 00:17:28.443
SURE I AM,
BUT YOUR FIELD'S
RUNNING ON EMPTY!

00:17:28.443 --> 00:17:30.779
WELL I'M ABOUT
TO FILL 'ER UP GREIGER!

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:32.013
[GRUNTS]

00:17:32.013 --> 00:17:34.783
I ACTIVATE VAYU'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:17:36.017 --> 00:17:38.353
SO BY REMOVING
MY BLACKWING VAYU

00:17:38.353 --> 00:17:41.790
AND ANOTHER MONSTER IN MY
GRAVEYARD FROM THE GAME,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.059
I'M NOW ALLOWED
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON!

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:47.195
BUT YOUR MONSTERS ARE
ALL IN THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:47.195 --> 00:17:48.229
[GRUNTS]

00:17:48.229 --> 00:17:49.631
WELL THEN CONSIDER
THIS A MESSAGE

00:17:49.631 --> 00:17:51.266
FROM THE GREAT BEYOND!

00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:53.368
SO LISTEN UP,
I CHOOSE BLACKWING

00:17:53.368 --> 00:17:54.602
ELPHIN THE RAVEN

00:17:54.602 --> 00:17:56.638
AND VAYU THE EMBLEM
OF HONOR.

00:17:56.638 --> 00:17:58.807
ONE ON ONE, THEY WEREN'T
MUCH OF A MATCH FOR YOU,

00:17:58.807 --> 00:18:01.810
BUT NOW THEY'RE HATCHING
INTO A WHOLE NEW BIRD OF PREY!

00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:08.249
I SYNCHRO SUMMON:
BLACKWING ARMOR MASTER!

00:18:08.249 --> 00:18:10.285
[ROARS]

00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:12.787
AND, AS ANOTHER
BONUS... PAL...

00:18:12.787 --> 00:18:15.123
I GET TO SUMMON A SECOND
BLACKWING MONSTER

00:18:15.123 --> 00:18:17.392
AS LONG AS THERE'S
ALREADY ONE ON MY FIELD!

00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:19.394
'N' THIS LUCKY BIRD
IS BLACKWING...

00:18:19.394 --> 00:18:21.563
GALE THE WHIRLWIND!

00:18:21.563 --> 00:18:24.365
YOU GOT TWO MONSTERS
FOR THE PRICE OF NOTHING.

00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:26.901
PERHAPS I DID UNDERESTIMATE
YOUR LITTLE BIRDS.

00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:28.536
BUT YOU GOTTA REALIZE
THAT THIS DUEL

00:18:28.536 --> 00:18:30.371
ISN'T ABOUT BELIEVING
IN YOUR DECK,

00:18:30.371 --> 00:18:32.640
IT'S WHAT I CALL
A NUMBERS GAME.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.975
'N' AFTER TAKING A LOOK

00:18:33.975 --> 00:18:35.577
AT YOUR MONSTERS'
ATTACK POINTS...

00:18:35.577 --> 00:18:38.346
I CAN SEE YOUR STRATEGY
IS FOR THE BIRDS!

00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:55.110
NOW: BLACKWING ARMOR MASTER,

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.713
ATTACK FLYING FORTRESS
SKY FIRE!

00:18:57.713 --> 00:18:59.448
IS THIS SOME SORT
OF JOKE?

00:18:59.448 --> 00:19:00.916
JUST LOOK
AT THEIR POINTS!

00:19:00.916 --> 00:19:02.718
YOUR BLACKWING
DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE

00:19:02.718 --> 00:19:04.787
AGAINST MY
FLYING FORTRESS!

00:19:04.787 --> 00:19:05.854
WE'LL SEE!

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.290
NOW, ATTACK WITH
BLACK HURRICANE!

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.160
[GROWLS]

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.594
[ROARS]

00:19:13.996 --> 00:19:16.298
WHY DID CROW
ATTACK WITH THAT?!

00:19:16.298 --> 00:19:18.434
NOW HE'LL LOSE FOR SURE!

00:19:18.434 --> 00:19:19.601
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:21.270
HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DESTROYED!

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.638
HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YA:

00:19:22.638 --> 00:19:24.606
LIFE'S FULL 'A
DISAPPOINTMENTS GREIGER,

00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:27.309
AND HERE'S ANOTHER,
I DON'T TAKE ANY DAMAGE.

00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:30.479
THEN WHY ATTACK?!

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:32.247
IT WAS ALL JUST A WASTE!

00:19:33.482 --> 00:19:34.783
LOOK AGAIN!

00:19:34.783 --> 00:19:37.286
'CAUSE MY MONSTER
JUST MADE A BULL'S-EYE!

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:38.721
WHAT DO YOU MEAN??!

00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:41.991
IT'S JUST PART OF
ARMOR MASTER'S
SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:44.093
SEE HE'S GOT THESE
NIFTY LITTLE THINGS

00:19:44.093 --> 00:19:45.728
CALLED ARROWHEAD COUNTERS,

00:19:45.728 --> 00:19:48.097
AND I USED ONE OF 'EM
ON YOUR SKY FIRE.

00:19:48.097 --> 00:19:49.832
NOW, FOR THE REST OF THE TURN,

00:19:49.832 --> 00:19:54.103
BOTH YOUR ATTACK AND DEFENSE
POINTS ARE STUCK AT ZERO!

00:19:54.103 --> 00:19:56.105
MY SKY FIRE!

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:57.639
BLACKWING WHIRLWIND,
WHY DON'T YOU

00:19:57.639 --> 00:19:59.575
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE SITUATION!

00:19:59.575 --> 00:20:01.176
[SQUAWKS]

00:20:01.176 --> 00:20:02.745
[CAW]

00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:11.220
NOOOO!

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.389
[GRUNTING AND SHOUTS]

00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:18.994
GREIGER?!

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.232
YOUR WERE RIGHT YUSEI!

00:20:23.232 --> 00:20:24.733
I'M NO BETTER
THAN A DARK SIGNER

00:20:24.733 --> 00:20:26.301
IF I DUEL WITH HATE
IN MY HEART!

00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:27.836
I'M GLAD TO SEE
THE CROW I KNOW

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:29.505
IS BACK
TO BEING HIMSELF.

00:20:29.505 --> 00:20:30.639
NOW LET'S...

00:20:33.842 --> 00:20:35.277
[BOTH GRUNT]

00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:38.213
TALK 'BOUT COUNTING YOUR
CHICKENS' BEFORE THEY HATCH!

00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:42.918
YOU SCRATCHED MY PAINT JOB
CROW... YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:45.721
Crow: WELL YOU GOTTA
CATCH ME FIRST.

00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:47.356
AND SINCE YOU LOSE
A SPEED COUNTER

00:20:47.356 --> 00:20:49.024
FOR EVERY THOUSAND
POINTS OF DAMAGE,

00:20:49.024 --> 00:20:51.460
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU MAY NEVER CASH IN!

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.928
AND WHILE YOU
TRY 'N' PLAY CATCH UP

00:20:52.928 --> 00:20:54.496
WITH YOUR LITTLE TRICYCLE...

00:20:54.496 --> 00:20:56.732
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:20:56.732 --> 00:20:58.000
NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.269
OH, YOU'LL DO MORE
THAN SEE IT!

00:21:00.269 --> 00:21:03.238
DON'T FORGET THAT THIS
SHADOW DUEL'S FULL CONTACT!

00:21:03.238 --> 00:21:05.040
JUST WATCH THIS!

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:08.677
WITH SKY FIRE OUT OF THE WAY

00:21:08.677 --> 00:21:10.379
MY FIELD'S COMPLETELY EMPTY...

00:21:10.379 --> 00:21:14.049
WHICH MEANS I CAN SUMMON
DARK TUNER DOOM SUBMARINE!

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:17.286
LIKE YOUR BIRDS,

00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:19.288
HE WAS STUCK
IN THE GRAVEYARD.

00:21:19.288 --> 00:21:21.557
BUT NOW, HE'S READY TO SURFACE!

00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:25.594
NICE MOVE, BUT I THINK YOUR
SUBMARINE'S ATTACK POINTS

00:21:25.594 --> 00:21:27.796
GOT "DEEP SIXED"
ON THE WAY UP.

00:21:27.796 --> 00:21:29.932
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT IT WON'T BE OUT THERE

00:21:29.932 --> 00:21:31.300
ALL ALONE FOR LONG!

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.570
I SUMMON DARKSEA RESCUE
IN ATTACK MODE!

[DARKSEA RESCUE
THIRSTY MEN LAUGH]

00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:40.375
AND NOW I DARK TUNE

00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:43.278
MY DOOM SUBMARINE
AND MY DARKSEA RESCUE

00:21:43.278 --> 00:21:46.248
IN ORDER TO SYNCHRO SUMMON
DARK FLATTOP!

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:51.086
[BOTH GIGGLING]

00:21:52.454 --> 00:21:55.824
Greiger: WHEN THE SHADOWS ARE
DEVOURED BY EVEN DARKER SHADOWS,

00:21:55.824 --> 00:21:58.293
THE CURTAIN
PULLS BACK AND REVEALS...

00:21:58.327 --> 00:22:00.295
A WORLD WITHOUT LIGHT!

00:22:09.304 --> 00:22:11.740
Crow: WHAT IS
THAT THING?!

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.077
Greiger: [CHUCKLES] YOUR DOOM.

00:22:22.518 --> 00:22:25.154
CROW'LL NEVER
SINK THAT THING!

00:22:25.154 --> 00:22:26.922
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE THIS DUEL'S

00:22:26.922 --> 00:22:29.224

I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!
