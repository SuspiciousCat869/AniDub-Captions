00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
Yusei: NOW LET'S GET UP TO SPEED
WITH "YU-GI-OH 5D'S"!

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.606
Jack: WHAT?
YOU WANT TO DUEL ME?!

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.875
WAIT. BUT WHY WOULD YA
WANNA DO THAT, YUSEI?

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.843
I NEED TO FIND
A NEW WAY
OF BATTLING

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.679
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
SUMMONING SYNCHRO
MONSTERS.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.081
SYNCHROS ARE FINE.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.984
BUT IF YOU WANT A DUEL--
YOU'RE ON.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.785
Yusei: LET'S REV IT UP!

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.723
GO, TWIN-SWORD MARAUDER,
ATTACK SHIELD WING!

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.725
AAH!

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.994
NOW I'LL TUNE
MY LEVEL 3 SWORD MASTER

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:30.297
WITH THE LEVEL 1 DARK BUG
AND LEVEL 4 TWIN-SWORD
MARAUDER

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:33.734
TO DO WHAT YOU SHOULD'VE
NEVER QUESTIONED DOING,
YUSEI...

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.436
I'M GOING TO BRING OUT
THE ULTIMATE,
THE ALL POWERFUL,

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:39.673
THE RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND
IN A SYNCHRO SUMMON!

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:42.843
GO, RED DRAGON ARCHFIEND,
ATTACK BACKUP WARRIOR!

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:46.346
AAH!

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.785
WE BOTH KNOW HOW
IT'S GOING TO END--

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.254
THERE'S NO POINT
GOING ANY FURTHER.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.623
SYNCHRO MONSTERS
MAY NOT BE PERFECT,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:59.459
BUT THEY'RE STILL
THE BEST WEAPON WE'VE GOT.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.396
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT
THE GALA IS A GREAT SUCCESS,

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:03.764
MY DIRECTORS.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.366
THE FOOLS DON'T HAVE A CLUE
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.235
[CHUCKLE]

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.537
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT IT STAYS THAT WAY.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.307
AFTER ALL,
IF THESE DUELISTS FIND OUT
WHAT WE'RE UP TO,

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.242
THIS WILL ALL BE IN VAIN.

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.344
YES, IF WE'RE GOING
TO USE THEIR POWER,

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:21.081
THEY MUST BELIEVE THAT
THEY'RE EXERTING IT ONLY
TO WIN THIS TOURNAMENT.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.650
THEN, WHEN THEIR
DUEL ENERGY IS OURS

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.353
AND READY TO BE CHANNELED
FOR THE GRAND DESIGN,

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.822
IT WILL BE TOO LATE
FOR THEM TO STOP ME--

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:34.127
THAT IS, TOO LATE FOR THEM
TO STOP US.

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:36.530
HEY, OUTTA THE WAY!
WE'RE IN A HURRY HERE!

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.666
Jack: FORGET HIM, YUSEI,
LET'S GO!

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.335
GO AND DO WHAT?

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.636
HUH?

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:45.472
THE DUEL WILL BE OVER
BY THE TIME
YOU FIND THE GHOST.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.208
AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HELP.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.443
WILL YOU, YUSEI?

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.544
[GASP]

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.746
YOU'RE NOT READY TO FACE
THE GHOST AGAIN.

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.682
YOU MUST FIRST FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR:

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:57.551
THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION!

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.653
HOW ABOUT A NAME
OR SOMETHING, BUDDY?

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.321
YOU CAN CALL ME VIZOR.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.190
HOW DO WE KNOW
WE CAN TRUST YOU?

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.627

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:23.270
TO DEFEAT THAT MACHINE
EMPEROR WISEL INFINITY.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.005

STARDUST DRAGON!

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:36.450
IT'S TOO LATE, YUSEI,
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.151
YOUR DRAGON IS
ABOUT TO BECOME

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.954
JUST ANOTHER GEAR
IN MY MACHINE!

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.557
[THINKING]
GUESS I'LL FIND OUT.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.330
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.800
LETTING YUSEI TAKE OFF
WITH SOME GUY
WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.868
NO, I'M NOT.

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.303
THEN WHY DID YOU
LET HIM GO?!

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:58.038
CUZ YUSEI'S GONNA DO
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO

00:03:58.038 --> 00:03:59.706
WHETHER WE LIKE IT
OR NOT,

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.108
ESPECIALLY LATELY.

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:04.010
WHO KNOWS
WHY HE'S ACTING SO WEIRD
THESE DAYS?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.045
[GASP]

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:08.148
I THINK THAT I MAY KNOW WHY.

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:10.350
I WILL BE RIDING FULL THROTTLE
ON THE CUTTING EDGE

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.853
WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE
AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN!

00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:16.156
IS THAT NOT THE KIND OF DUEL
YOU WANT IN ON, YUSEI FUDO?

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.958
IF YOU RACE WITH ME,

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.328
YOU WILL FIND THE DRIVE
YOU SEEK.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.265
HELLO?
EARTH TO AKIZA!

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.400
YOU OK? YOU LOOK
PRETTY DEEP IN THOUGHT.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.803
UH, I'M FINE.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.939
HEY, LOOK!
THEY'RE SQUARING UP!

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.110
YES!
THEY'RE GONNA BATTLE!

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.945
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.147
FROM THE LOOKS
OF IT,

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:43.283
I'D SAY VIZOR
HAS SOMETHING ELSE
PLANNED.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:47.521
THINK YOU CAN KEEP UP,
YUSEI?

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.426
HUH? THIS GUY
WANTS TO RACE?

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.730

BUT WHAT'S THAT GONNA
ACCOMPLISH?!

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:01.201

YOU WANNA REV IT UP?
FINE WITH ME.

HE'S PACKING HARDCORE

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:13.113

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.028
COME ON. PICK UP
THE PACE, YUSEI!

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.864
SHOW THIS SLOWPOKE
WHAT YOU CAN DO!

[THINKING]
RIGHT NOW, IT'S ALL
I CAN DO TO KEEP UP,

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.805
BUT IF VIZOR REALLY DOES HAVE
THE ANSWERS I'M LOOKING FOR,

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.808
I'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT!

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.910

TO BEAT THE GHOST.

VIZOR ALREADY
HAS A TUNER OUT.

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:52.298

IT'S A SYNCHRO,

HAVE ANY ABILITIES

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:54.661

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:35.101
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
TECH GENUS WONDER MAGICIAN!

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.703
Computer:
TECH GENUS WONDER MAGICIAN

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:41.174
IS A LEVEL 5 SYNCHRO TUNER
MONSTER WITH 1,900 ATTACK POINTS

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:44.077
AND ZERO DEFENSE POINTS.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.747
NOW HE'S GOT
TWO SYNCHRO MONSTERS?!

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:49.582
WHAT'S YUSEI
GONNA DO NOW?

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:50.650
DON'T WORRY, SIS!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.353
YUSEI CAN HANDLE THIS,
NO PROBLEM!

00:10:53.353 --> 00:10:54.621
AND NOW, GLADIATOR,

00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:57.290
SHOW THAT TRICULAR
THE MIGHT OF YOUR AXE!

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.325
ATTACK!!!

00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.896
UNH!

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:06.132
AND NOW YOU TAKE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEIR POINTS AS DAMAGE!

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.700
I WAS WRONG!

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:11.604
OHH.

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.173
YOU OK, YUSEI?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.541
OR HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH?

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:15.775
I'M JUST GETTING
STARTED,

00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.343
AND SO IS TRICULAR!

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.912
BECAUSE WHEN HE'S
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.813
HE ALLOWS ME
TO SUMMON BICULAR!

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.282
WELL, THEN I GUESS
IT'S A GOOD THING

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:24.817
I HAVE ANOTHER SYNCHRO
READY ON DECK!

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:28.488
GO, WONDER MAGICIAN,
DESTROY BICULAR!

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:31.658
SORRY, BUT IT'S
GONNA TAKE 3 MONSTERS
TO KEEP MY FIELD CLEAR

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:37.030
BECAUSE WHEN BICULAR IS
DESTROYED, UNICYCULAR IS
READY TO ROLL!

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.398
GUESS I'M DONE.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:40.700
YES! YUSEI'S
HOLDING HIS OWN!

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.135
[THINKING]
OR THINKS HE IS.

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.803
HE'S BEEN WRONG BEFORE.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:45.905
THEN I'LL ACTIVATE
ITS SPECIAL ABILITY

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:49.008
AND FORCE
YOUR CHEVALIER
INTO DEFENSE MODE.

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:50.376
THAT DOES NOTHING
FOR YOU!

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.045
THAT LITTLE SYNCHRON
HAS NO HOPE

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.914
OF CRASHING THROUGH
FLEUR DE CHEVALIER'S DEFENSE.

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.951
AND WITH DEFEAT,
COMES DAMAGE.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.522
ONLY A HUNDRED
LIFE POINTS LEFT.

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:05.458
YUSEI, DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.760
[GASP]

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.096
YUSEI?

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:17.904
[THINKING]
I HOPE YUSEI'S NOT IN
OVER HIS HEAD HERE.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.007
[THINKING]
CONSECUTIVE ATTACKS BY TWO
SYNCHRO MONSTERS.

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:23.710
IS THIS THE STRATEGY
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR?

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.079
THE TECHNIQUE TO DEFEAT
MACHINE EMPEROR WISEL?

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.480
THANKS TO
YOUR SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.550
MY MACHINE EMPEROR NOW GAINS
2,500 EXTRA POINTS

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.252
TO DO DAMAGE TO YOU WITH!

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.420
HA HA HA!

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.129
[THINKING]
IT COULD WORK.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.831
AFTER ALL,
MACHINE EMPEROR WISEL

00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.400
CAN ONLY ABSORB
ONE SYNCHRO PER TURN.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.769
IF THERE WERE TWO,
THEN IF ONE
WAS TAKEN DOWN,

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.704
ANOTHER WOULD BE ABLE
TO FIGHT!

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.339
BUT IS THAT
ALL THERE IS TO IT?

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:57.543
OR WAS VIZOR HINTING
AT SOMETHING MORE?

00:12:57.543 --> 00:13:02.181
YUSEI, YOU'RE NOT READY TO
FACE THE GHOST AGAIN.

00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:06.886
YOU MUST FIRST FIND
THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.055
WELL?
YOUR MOVE, YUSEI.

00:13:09.055 --> 00:13:11.291
HAVE YOU THOUGHT IT
THROUGH?

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.459
HAH! YOU BETTER
BELIEVE IT!

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:16.663
COME ON, YES, PERFECT!

00:13:16.663 --> 00:13:19.899
I ACTIVATE THE SPEED SPELL
SYNCHRO DEFUSE!

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.168
NOW, SINCE I HAVE
TWO OR MORE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:25.505
I GAIN CONTROL
OF ONE SYNCHRO MONSTER
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:28.441
UNTIL THE END PHASE
OF THIS TURN!

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.543
SO HE JUST STOLE
VIZOR'S SYNCHRO?

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.745
YEP--JUST LIKE
THE GHOST STOLE HIS!

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:33.746
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:34.981
IF YUSEI DUELS
AGAINST VIZOR

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.482
LIKE THE GHOST
DUELED AGAINST HIM,

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:41.421
THEN HOWEVER VIZOR COUNTERS
WILL BE THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION!

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:49.829
TECH GENUS GLADIATOR
IS NOW ALL MINE, VIZOR!

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.231
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.036
AAH!

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.204
YEAH, HERE WE GO!

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:59.706
WELL DONE, YUSEI.

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:01.507
NOW PREPARE TO STEP
OUT OF THE SHADOWS

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:02.875
AND INTO THE LIGHT.

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.310
GO, ACCEL SYNCHRO!

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.446
ACCEL SYNCHRO?!

00:14:25.284 --> 00:14:26.619
BEHOLD, YUSEI!

00:14:26.619 --> 00:14:28.454
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION,

00:14:28.454 --> 00:14:31.157
SO I GIVE YOU
THE ACCEL SYNCHRO!

00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:33.760
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
VIZOR?!

00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:37.330
WATCH AND SEE!

00:14:44.303 --> 00:14:45.405
UNH!
UNH!

00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:47.607
AARGH!
AARGH!

00:14:53.413 --> 00:14:55.515
WHERE DID HE GO?

00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:12.098
WHERE'D THAT MONSTER
COME FROM?!

00:15:12.098 --> 00:15:14.133
AND WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS IT?

00:15:14.133 --> 00:15:16.069
IT'S AN ACCEL
SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:17.837
TECH GENUS BLADE BLASTER.

00:15:17.837 --> 00:15:20.173
WAIT--AN ACCEL
SYNCHRO MONSTER?

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:21.874
WHAT'S THAT?

00:15:21.874 --> 00:15:23.176
AND HOW WERE YOU ABLE
TO SUMMON IT

00:15:23.176 --> 00:15:25.511
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY TURN?

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:30.416
AN ACCEL SYNCHRO SUMMON
USES A SYNCHRO TUNER MONSTER
AND A SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:32.952
AND IT'S DONE
WITH LIGHTNING-FAST SPEED!

00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:34.554
HUH!

00:15:34.554 --> 00:15:36.222
[THINKING]
OF COURSE,
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT

00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:37.724
BY FINDING
THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION!

00:15:37.724 --> 00:15:39.692
IT WAS THERE ALL ALONG,

00:15:39.692 --> 00:15:40.760
I JUST HAD TO
PUSH HARD ENOUGH

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.696
AND GO FAST ENOUGH
TO UNCOVER IT!

00:15:43.696 --> 00:15:46.365
NO WONDER HE CHALLENGED ME
TO RACE EARLIER.

00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:49.235
HE WANTED TO SEE
IF I HAD THE SPEED IT TOOK!

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:51.237
DON'T BE
TOO AWESTRUCK, YUSEI.

00:15:51.237 --> 00:15:53.573
WE'VE STILL GOT
A DUEL TO FINISH!

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:56.375
AND I GOTTA FEW CARDS THAT
MAY JUST HELP FINISH IT!

00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:57.844
HERE GOES!

00:15:57.844 --> 00:16:01.080
FIRST I ACTIVATE
THE SPEED SPELL
ANGEL BATON!

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.349
WITH THIS, SINCE I HAVE
TWO OR MORE SPEED COUNTERS,

00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:05.318
I GET TO DRAW
TWO CARDS FROM MY DECK,

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:07.987
BUT THEN MUST SEND
ONE CARD IN MY HAND
TO THE GRAVE.

00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:11.958
NEXT I SUMMON
THE TUNER MONSTER
DRILL SYNCHRON!

00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:16.329
AND NOW, SINCE
THERE'S A TUNER MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:20.433
I CAN SUMMON
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
FROM MY GRAVEYARD.

00:16:20.433 --> 00:16:22.735
NEXT, I'LL TUNE
LEVEL 3 DRILL SYNCHRON

00:16:22.735 --> 00:16:26.139
WITH LEVEL 1 UNICYCULAR
AND LEVEL 2 QUILLBOLT
HEDGEHOG

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:28.908
TO CREATE A GARGANTUAN
THAT CAN GRIND THROUGH

00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:33.546
EVEN THE GREATEST
GARRISONS OF DEFENSE!

00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:38.751
I SYNCHRO SUMMON...
DRILL WARRIOR!

00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:41.521
AND BY CUTTING
DRILL WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS IN HALF,

00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:45.291
HE'S ALLOWED TO TURN HIS
BRUTALIZING DRILL BITS
ON YOU!

00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.228
GO, DRILL WARRIOR!
UNDERGROUND GRINDER!

00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:01.974
AND THEN
I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN!

00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:03.943
AT LAST,
YOU'RE PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:05.812
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

00:17:05.812 --> 00:17:09.549
I WAS STARTING TO GET BORED
GOING SO EASY ON YOU.

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:14.687
BUT NOW IT SEEMS
I CAN FINALLY START
DUELING YOU WITH SOME FORCE!

00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:16.255
IT'S MY TURN NOW!

00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:17.990
HAH!

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.258
FIRST THINGS FIRST--

00:17:19.258 --> 00:17:23.062
TECH GENUS BLADE BLASTER,
DESTROY THAT DRILL WARRIOR!

00:17:25.932 --> 00:17:28.100
I ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD--
WAVE FORCE!

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.468
NOW, SINCE
A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:31.137
WAS THE TARGET
OF YOUR ATTACK,

00:17:31.137 --> 00:17:33.673
ALL MONSTERS ON
YOUR SIDE OF THE FIELD
IN ATTACK MODE

00:17:33.673 --> 00:17:35.541
WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:39.045
THAT'S DUELING
WITH FORCE.

00:17:39.045 --> 00:17:40.913
NOT SO FAST, YUSEI.

00:17:40.913 --> 00:17:43.049
BY SENDING ONE CARD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:45.351
MY BLADE BLASTER
SURVIVES YOUR TRAP!

00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:47.720
OBSERVE!

00:17:51.524 --> 00:17:53.392
[GRUNTING]

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.530
I PLAY THE TRAP
MIRACLE'S WAKE!

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.632
WITH THIS,
I CAN SUMMON
ONE MONSTER

00:17:59.632 --> 00:18:02.702
THAT WAS DESTROYED IN
BATTLE DURING THIS TURN!

00:18:02.702 --> 00:18:06.005
SO COME BACK,
DRILL WARRIOR!

00:18:09.508 --> 00:18:11.777
MOST IMPRESSIVE.

00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:14.580
THE DUEL FEED'S
BACK ONLINE!

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.382
WHAT ON EARTH
IS THAT MONSTER?!

00:18:16.382 --> 00:18:19.986
OH, NO--
YUSEI'S LIFE POINTS
ARE DOWN TO 1,100!

00:18:19.986 --> 00:18:23.222
Jakob: WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS ISN'T HOW WE LEFT THE DUEL.

00:18:23.222 --> 00:18:27.426
IT SEEMS WE MISSED SOMETHING
DURING THAT WHITE FLASH.

00:18:29.462 --> 00:18:32.231
[THINKING] I WAS ABLE
TO KEEP DRILL WARRIOR
OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:35.101
BUT WITH BLADE BLASTER
HAVING 3,300
ATTACK POINTS,

00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:37.770
HE'D BE COMPLETELY
OUTMATCHED
IF THEY BATTLED.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.172
I NEED TO COME UP
WITH ANOTHER STRATEGY.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:41.641
LET'S SEE HERE.

00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:46.245
THE CARDS IN MY HAND
ARE SPEED ENERGY
AND SHINING SILVER FORCE.

00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:47.346
WITH SPEED ENERGY,

00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:49.115
SINCE I HAVE TWO OR MORE
SPEED COUNTERS,

00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:52.685
A MONSTER ON MY FIELD
COULD GET A BIG BOOST
IN ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:52.685 --> 00:18:56.255
I GET TO MULTIPLY
HOWEVER MANY SPEED
COUNTERS I HAVE BY 200,

00:18:56.255 --> 00:18:57.456
AND THAT'S THE BONUS.

00:18:57.456 --> 00:18:58.858
I HAVE 3 COUNTERS NOW,

00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:00.693
BUT NEXT TURN,
I'LL HAVE 4,

00:19:00.693 --> 00:19:02.228
WHICH WOULD MEAN
I'D BE ABLE TO INCREASE

00:19:02.228 --> 00:19:04.630
A MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS BY 800.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:08.200
BUT THAT WOULD STILL
ONLY GIVE DRILL WARRIOR
3,200 ATTACK POINTS,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.338
AND THAT'S JUST NOT
ENOUGH TO BEAT VIZOR'S
BLADE BLASTER.

00:19:12.338 --> 00:19:14.173
FACE IT, YUSEI.

00:19:14.173 --> 00:19:15.975
THIS DUEL'S OVER!

00:19:15.975 --> 00:19:19.278
[THINKING]
IT WILL BE IF I DON'T
GET THE RIGHT DRAW...

00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:22.248
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:43.534
JUST ACCEPT IT!
YOU CAN'T WIN THIS!

00:19:43.534 --> 00:19:45.569
[THINKING]
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
CARDS IN MY DECK,

00:19:45.569 --> 00:19:47.338
I'VE STILL GOT A SHOT!

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:49.740
MY DRAW! HAH!

00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:57.514
I ACTIVATE THE SPEED
SPELL SPEED ENERGY!

00:19:57.514 --> 00:19:59.717
WITH IT, I CAN INCREASE
DRILL WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:19:59.717 --> 00:20:04.288
BY THE NUMBER OF
SPEED COUNTERS I HAVE
TIMES 200!

00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:08.125
AND NEXT, I'LL SUMMON
GAUNTLET WARRIOR!

00:20:10.194 --> 00:20:12.830
BUT HE WON'T STAY
FOR LONG, BECAUSE BY
RELEASING HIM,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:18.335
ALL WARRIOR-TYPE
MONSTERS ON MY FIELD
GAIN 500 ATTACK POINTS!

00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:21.105
I RELEASE YOU, WARRIOR!

00:20:23.874 --> 00:20:28.779
NOW DRILL WARRIOR'S ATTACK
POINTS INCREASE TO 3,700!

00:20:32.449 --> 00:20:34.051
AND THAT MEANS
HE'S MORE THAN A MATCH

00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:36.420
FOR TECH GENUS
BLADE BLASTER!

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.289
SO LET HIM HAVE IT,
DRILL WARRIOR!

00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:40.291
WHIRLWIND WINDER!

00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.592
ALL RIGHT!

00:20:41.592 --> 00:20:43.060
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.795
I PLAY AN ABILITY!

00:20:44.795 --> 00:20:48.933
IT LETS ME REMOVE
BLADE BLASTER FROM PLAY
ONCE PER TURN!

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:51.035
BUT THAT MEANS...

00:20:54.939 --> 00:20:55.940
HUH?

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.107
[GASP]
[GASP]

00:20:57.107 --> 00:21:00.644
CHECK IT!
HE TOOK THE HIT
TO SAVE HIS MONSTER!

00:21:00.644 --> 00:21:02.379
HUH?

00:21:15.826 --> 00:21:19.296
VIZOR, ARE YOU OK?

00:21:19.296 --> 00:21:21.265
YES, IM PERFECTLY FINE.

00:21:21.265 --> 00:21:22.800
THAT WAS A GOOD FINISH.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.402
MAYBE...BUT THAT
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
THE FINISH, VIZOR.

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:26.837
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

00:21:26.837 --> 00:21:29.440
WHY DID YOU PROTECT
YOUR MONSTER WITH
YOUR LIFE POINTS?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.742
IT MAKES NO SENSE!

00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:32.843
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:32.843 --> 00:21:34.011
I WOULD EXPLAIN,

00:21:34.011 --> 00:21:35.079
BUT I'M AFRAID
THAT I CAN'T REVEAL

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:37.948
ALL THE SECRETS OF
THE ACCEL SYNCHRO, YUSEI.

00:21:37.948 --> 00:21:41.185
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT DON'T I KNOW?

00:21:41.185 --> 00:21:43.687
THE ANSWERS WILL ALL COME
IN GOOD TIME.

00:21:43.687 --> 00:21:46.757
UNTIL THEN, I'LL BE LOOKING
FORWARD TO OUR NEXT DUEL.

00:21:46.757 --> 00:21:48.425
HUH?

00:22:00.437 --> 00:22:03.140
BAH. WHAT KIND OF
A LAME ENDING WAS THAT?

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.575
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:06.377
THAT WAS NO WASTE.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:11.115
YOU'RE SIMPLY TOO BLIND
TO SEE WHAT REALLY
JUST HAPPENED, LESTER,

00:22:11.115 --> 00:22:15.986
TO SEE THAT
A WHOLE NEW AGE OF DUELING
HAS JUST BEGUN.

00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:18.088
NEW...BUT OLD.

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:20.958
ANCIENT, EVEN.

00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:24.094
[THINKING]
SOMETHING HAPPENED
INSIDE THAT LIGHT,

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:27.831
SOMETHING THAT I NEED
TO FIND OUT.

00:22:33.704 --> 00:22:36.306
ACCEL SYNCHRO.

00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:45.916
I'VE FOUND THE SYNCHRO SOLUTION.

00:22:45.916 --> 00:22:47.684
BUT IF I'M GOING TO MASTER IT,

00:22:47.684 --> 00:22:51.555
I'VE GOTTA PUSH
BEYOND MY LIMITS.
