00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.901
WHOA...I GUESS I WON'T
BE WAGING AN ATTACK
THIS ROUND.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.369
I END MY TURN.

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:19.272
IT'S MY MOVE...
AND I'LL PLAY...

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:21.774
THE SPELL INFERNITY BURST.

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:24.143
NOW FOR EVERY INFERNITY
MONSTER ON MY FIELD,

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:28.214
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.584
ARGH!

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:32.986
AND NEXT...

00:12:32.986 --> 00:12:36.489
I'LL HAVE INFERNITY DESTROYER
ATTACK ILLEGAL KEEPER!

00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:45.798
ARGH!

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:47.867
AND SINCE MY DESTROYER
WON THAT BATTLE

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:49.435
WHILE I HAD NO CARDS
IN MY HAND...

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.705
YOU NOW TAKE 1,600
POINTS OF DAMAGE.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.842
NO FAIR.
I BARELY HAD ONE TURN!

00:12:55.842 --> 00:12:57.644
[HORSES NEIGH]

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.552
AH!

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:09.956
NO! STOP! DON'T! PLEASE!

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.760
HEH HEH.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.995
[HORSES NEIGH]

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.970
[CHEERING]

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:26.906
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.375
THE GIANT WILL NOW
BE SHIPPED OFF TO
THE MOUNTAIN,

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.577
AND THAT'S WHERE
HE'LL STAY FOR THE
REST OF HIS LIFE.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.347
MINING DYNE MORNING,
NOON, AND NIGHT.

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:37.684
ALL UNDER THE WATCHFUL
EYE OF RADLEY'S MEN.

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:41.654
AH. SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE 3
WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM--

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.356
THE MINES.

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:45.758
THEY MUST'VE BEEN DUELISTS
WHO'D LOST.

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:48.661
BUT IF KALIN IS TRYING
TO PUNISH HIMSELF,

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.064
WHY WOULDN'T HE JUST LOSE
ON PURPOSE?

00:13:51.064 --> 00:13:52.965
I DON'T KNOW.

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:54.767
REACT) THERE ARE A LOT
OF QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.437
THAT I SIMPLY HAVE
NO ANSWERS FOR.

00:13:57.437 --> 00:13:59.739
HOPEFULLY
WE CAN FIND SOME.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:01.374
AND SOON.

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:04.544
I AGREE.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.183
WELL DONE, KALIN.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:12.385
THAT GIANT COULDN'T DUEL
WORTH A LICK,

00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:14.354
BUT I'M SURE HE'LL BE
A SOLID WORKER.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.988
HOW MANY WINS IS THAT?

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:17.790
SOMETHING LIKE 50
IN A ROW?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.126
CURSE YOU, RADLEY,
YOU RAT!

00:14:20.126 --> 00:14:22.261
I'LL BEAT YOU AND THAT
LUCKY DUELIST A' YOURS

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.563
NEXT TIME FOR SURE!

00:14:23.563 --> 00:14:26.799
YEAH, I'VE HEARD THAT
BEFORE. HA HA!

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.202
GRR...
LET'S ROLL.

00:14:34.474 --> 00:14:37.076
KALIN!

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.381
IT'S ME!

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.515
HUH?

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:45.318
IT'S YUSEI.
LET'S TALK!

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:52.325
NO! KALIN, WAIT!
I'M HERE TO HELP!

00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:53.659
LET HIM GO.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:57.530
I KNOW A BETTER
WAY TO HELP.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.098
I JUST HOPE YOU'RE
UP FOR IT.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:22.655
CURSES! THAT RAT RADLEY ALWAYS
WINS WITH THAT DUELIST OF HIS!

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:26.125
AND THE MORE THAT HE WINS...
THE MORE HE EARNS!

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.627
IF ONLY MY BABY BROTHER
LAWTON

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:30.696
WAS HANGING HIS HAT
IN TOWN RIGHT NOW,

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:33.366
HE'D TAKE THAT CREEP,
KALIN--RARH!

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:35.368
AND DUEL HIM DOWN INTO THE DIRT!

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:36.736
Yusei: HEY!
HUH?

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:39.205
WHO ARE YOU?

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:40.406
HEY IT'S THAT GUY!

00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:41.641
FROM BACK IN TOWN!

00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:46.946
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND I'M HERE FOR SOME WORK.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:48.080
A DUELIST, HUH?

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.217
WELL, BRING IT ON!

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:53.386
HA HA!

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:55.588
NOT A BAD IDEA.
IF YOU WANT US TO HIRE YOU,

00:15:55.588 --> 00:15:59.158
YOU'LL HAVE TO PROVE YA GOT
SKILLS WORTH PAYIN' FOR!

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.694
AND PROVE IT IN A DUEL.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:04.764
IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.
LET'S DO THIS.

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:07.033
[CHUCKLING]

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.541
GET YOUR GAME ON!

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.376
IF YA DON'T MIND,
I'LL MOVE FIRST.

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.045
OK THEN, NOW GET READY!

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:24.150
I SUMMON THE TUNER
MONSTER CHANGER SYNCHRON
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.987
I'LL THEN END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.056
I GUESS I'M UP!

00:16:30.056 --> 00:16:32.959
AND FUSE RAY BLASTER'S
THE MONSTER I'LL BE PLAYIN'!

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:36.596
LUCKY FOR YOU
SINCE IT'S THREE ON ONE,

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:39.799
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ATTACK.
NOT OFFICIALLY.

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.401
MY TURN NOW!

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:45.938
AND I'M SUMMONIN' OUT
ANOTHER FUSE RAY BLASTER!

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:48.774
BLAST AWAY!

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:49.842
AH!

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.178
AW, I'M AWFULLY SORRY
THERE, STRANGER.

00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.847
DIDN'T YA KNOW THAT WHEN
THERE'S ONE RAY BLASTER OUT

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.718
AND A SECOND IS SUMMONED,
YOU TAKE 800 POINTS OF DAMAGE?

00:16:58.718 --> 00:17:00.920
HUH.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.256
THAT'S IT FOR ME!

00:17:03.256 --> 00:17:05.658
THEN IT'S MY MOVE! HEH!

00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:08.794
AND I SUMMON ANOTHER
FUSE RAY BLASTER!

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:11.297
BLAST AWAY!
BLAST AWAY!

00:17:11.297 --> 00:17:14.333
UH!

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.202
HEH HEH.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.670
I END MY TURN.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.905
SO...

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.139
ARE YOU READY
TO GIVE UP?

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:22.108
YA CAN'T WIN!

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:25.278
HUH?

00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:26.946
I WILL WIN!

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.750
YOU HAVE TO BEAT
MALCOLM'S STOOGES.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.818
ONLY THEN WILL MALCOLM
TRUST YOU ENOUGH

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.687
TO LET YOU DUEL FOR HIS CREW.

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:37.690
THEN, IF YOU CAN BEAT KALIN,
WE'LL MAKE OUR MOVE.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.993
BEFORE THEY DRAG HIM
OFF TO WORK FOREVER
IN THOSE MOUNTAINS,

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:44.397
WE'LL TAKE HIM.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.798
IT'S MY MOVE,
AND FIRST I'LL SEND

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.000
ONE MONSTER CARD
IN MY HAND TO THE GRAVE

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.839
WHICH ALLOWS ME TO
SUMMON THE TUNER MONSTER
QUICKDRAW FROM MY HAND!

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.409
AND NOW SINCE A TUNER
MONSTER IS ON MY FIELD,

00:17:56.409 --> 00:18:00.046
I CAN SUMMON
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG
FROM THE GRAVEYARD!

00:18:00.046 --> 00:18:01.881
BUT I'M NOT DONE YET--

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:04.350
NEXT I'LL TUNE
LEVEL 5 QUICKDRAW
SYNCHRON

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.852
WITH LEVEL 2
QUILLBOLT HEDGEHOG

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:10.222
TO CREATE A CREATURE
THAN CAN REALLY
GIVE ME A BOOST!

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:15.628
I SYNCHRO SUMMON...
NITRO WARRIOR!

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:19.165
AND NEXT...I'LL BRING
OUT GAUNTLET WARRIOR!

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:20.700
BUT HE WON'T BE AROUND
FOR LONG

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.934
BECAUSE I'M NOW
GOING TO TUNE

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.070
LEVEL 1 CHANGER
SYNCHRON WITH HIM

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.439
TO CREATE ANOTHER
SYNCHRO MONSTER!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:30.743
HOW ABOUT GIVING ME
A HAND. ARMORY ARM!

00:18:30.743 --> 00:18:32.445
Duel Runner Computer:
ONCE PER TURN,

00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:35.448
YOU CAN EQUIP ARMORY ARM
ON TO A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:40.653
AND INCREASE THE EQUIPPED
MONSTER'S ATTACK POINTS
BY 1,000.

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:43.222
AND NOW
SINCE CHANGER SYNCHRON

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.490
WAS SENT TO THE GRAVE...

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.025
HIS EFFECT ACTIVATES

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.127
AND YOUR MONSTER
SWITCHES TO
DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.462
HUH?

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.831
NEXT I'LL USE ARMORY
ARM'S ABILITY...

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.200
AND WITH IT I CAN ADD
A LITTLE MORE MUSCLE

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.703
TO MY NITRO WARRIOR'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.672
OH, NO, 3,800?!

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.507
OH, YEAH, AND I'M
NOT DONE YET

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:05.811
CUZ I'M ALSO EQUIPPING
HIM WITH JUNK BARRAGE!

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:09.148
AND SINCE I ACTIVATED
A SPELL CARD THIS TURN,

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:13.552
NITRO WARRIOR GAINS
1,000 ATTACK POINTS
FOR THIS ROUND'S ATTACK!

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:15.655
RARH!

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:18.491
WHICH MEANS YOU THREE ARE
IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.659
[SCARED REACT]

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:23.362
GO, NITRO WARRIOR!
ATTACK WITH DYNAMITE
CRUNCH!

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:31.337
OH!

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.105
HUH?

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:38.544
UH! HOW?!

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:42.214
ITS SIMPLE, SEE
WHEN NITRO WARRIOR
DESTROYS A MONSTER,

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.916
HE CAN THEN SWITCH
ANOTHER MONSTER
INTO ATTACK MODE

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:45.718
AND THEN STRIKE AGAIN.

00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:48.187
THEN, SINCE AN EQUIPPED
MONSTER DESTROYED A
MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:50.022
ARMORY ARM'S ABILITY
DEALS DAMAGE

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.958
EQUAL TO FUSE RAY
BLASTER'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.294
BUT THERE'S MORE.
SINCE JUNK BARRAGE
IS IN PLAY,

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.463
HALF OF YOUR RAY
BLASTER'S ATTACK POINTS

00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:00.800
ARE DEALT,
ERASING THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.501
NOW TO DEAL WITH YOU.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:05.304
I ACTIVATE THE TRAP
SYNCHRO OVERLIMIT!

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.073
WITH THIS, SINCE
MY SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:20:07.073 --> 00:20:09.341
SUCCESSFULLY DESTROYED
A MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.644
HE'S ALLOWED TO BATTLE
AGAIN THIS TURN!

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:13.279
WHAT?! NO WAY!

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:15.281
GO DYNAMITE CRUNCH!

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:19.752
AND NOW THE EFFECTS
OF ARMORY ARM AND
JUNK BARRAGE ACTIVATE!

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:22.188
AAH!

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:24.356
OOF!

00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:31.864
[MOANING]

00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:34.233
HE JUST BEAT
THREE OF MY MEN.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.268
AND ALL IN JUST
ONE SINGLE TURN!

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:42.208
THIS GUY IS REALLY SOMETHING!
HA HA!

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:43.709
I LIKE HOW YA DUEL STRANGER.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:46.445
THINK YOU CAN DO THAT AGAIN
AGAINST KALIN?

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:49.548
I WAS HOPING THAT
YOU'D ASK THAT

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:53.152
CAUSE' I'M YOU'RE MAN.
