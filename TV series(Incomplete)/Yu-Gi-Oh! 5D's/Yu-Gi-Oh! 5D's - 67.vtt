00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:06.393
LAST SEMESTER, THE ACADEMIC
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SCHOOL

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:08.461
ROSE UP INTO
THE STRATOSPHERE OF EXCELLENCE

00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.696
LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.197
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
A LITTLE TOO SLOW

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:12.966
TO COMPREHEND
SARCASM AND METAPHOR,

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.301
THAT MEANS THAT
IT DID NOT RISE UP!

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.670
IT PLUMMETED
TO THE DEPTHS OF MEDIOCRITY

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.305
FASTER THAN YOU CAN
SAY "FAILURE,"

00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:20.006
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR CLASS!

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.375
EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT WITH
ALL DUE RESPECT-,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:24.244
THESE KIDS ARE
ENTHUSIASTIC DUELISTS,

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:25.545
THEY WANT TO LEARN
AND THEY WILL.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.113
I CAN VOUCH FOR THEIR
SKILL AND POTENTIAL.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.882
YOU SEE SKILL IN THIS LOT?

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:31.584
PERHAPS YOU ARE PART OF
THE PROBLEM, MISS BARTLET.

00:07:31.584 --> 00:07:33.286
ME? THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:35.121
PERHAPS I'LL SUGGEST
TO THE CHANCELLOR

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.590
THAT WE SHOULD RE-EVALUATE
OUR TEACHER CRITERIA

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.293
AND THEN WEED OUT
OUR FACULTY ACCORDINGLY.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:44.030
GO AHEAD, HEITMANN,
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF
MY TRACK RECORD.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.265
IT'S NOT MISS BARTLET.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.167
WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
GIVING IT OUR BEST.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:48.401
BUT GIVE US
A LITTLE MORE TIME

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.737
AND LET US PROVE TO
YOU--WE'RE DUELISTS!

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:53.340
YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF TIME
TO PROVE YOURSELF
AND YOU FAILED.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.641
ESPECIALLY YOU!

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.277
YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
BOTTOM OF THE BOTTOM, LEO!

00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:59.379
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE--

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:00.947
Leo: AKIZA!

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.282
ATTENTION CRETINS!

00:08:02.282 --> 00:08:04.250
PLEASE WELCOME
A REAL DUELIST!

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.086
YOU CAN'T EXPEL
THIS CLASS, HEITMANN.

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:07.687
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, AKIZA?

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.155
I WOULD THINK
ONE BOASTING

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.124
SUCH DISCIPLINE
AND APTITUDE AS YOURSELF

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.493
WOULD CERTAINLY ENDORSE
MY DECISION TO JETTISON

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.228
THESE PARASITES
FROM OUR RANKS.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.796
HOW CAN YOU
CALL YOURSELF A TEACHER

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.198
WHEN YOU'RE WILLING
TO GIVE UP ON THE KIDS

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:19.766
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TEACHING?

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:21.067
UH-OH...
UH-OH'S RIGHT.

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:22.736
IF AKIZA GETS
TOO WORKED UP,

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:24.571
THIS WHOLE PLACE WILL
COME CRASHING DOWN.

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:25.805
Yusei: UH, EXCUSE ME...

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:27.007
Leo and Luna: YUSEI?
[STUDENTS MURMURING]

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.242
WELL, RING MY BELL
AND SING ME A DITTY,

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.977
IT'S THE FORTUNE CUP
CHAMPION!

[STUDENTS CHEERING]

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.980
WHAT IS IT
THAT BRINGS YOU TO

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.282
THE ONCE ILLUSTRIOUS
HALLS OF DUEL ACADEMY?

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.218
I CAME HERE TO DO
SOME REPAIR WORK.

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:40.420
WHUH? COME AGAIN?

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.721
I WAS TOLD
THERE WAS SOMETHING

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:43.123
MALFUNCTIONING IN
THIS CLASSROOM

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.058
AND THAT I SHOULD
FIX IT IF I COULD.

00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:47.093
I SEE.
WELL, I HOPE
YOU AREN'T ALLUDING

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:49.896
TO THESE RATHER PITIFUL
GOOBERS GATHERED BEFORE ME.

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.564
I'M AFRAID THIS
SORRY BUNCH OF STUDENTS

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.665
IS BEYOND REPAIR.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:53.666
Maria: THAT'S
NOT TRUE.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.802
THIS CLASS
IS FULL
OF POTENTIAL.

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:57.504
YA KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU SERIOUSLY WANNA

00:08:57.504 --> 00:08:58.938
KICK OUT THIS ENTIRE CLASS

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.473
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOOD ENOUGH,

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.842
THEN WHATEVER, BUT IF
THEY GO, THEN I GO WITH 'EM.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.878
DO YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA STOP ME?!

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:06.479
THIS ACADEMY CAN'T
INDULGE THE WHIMS

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:07.914
OF EVERY WANNABE NIMROD

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:10.583
WHO ONLY KNOWS HOW TO USE
WORTHLESS, LOW-LEVEL CARDS.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:12.519

OF MONSTERS

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.554
THESE RUNTS ARE TOYING WITH
WEEK AFTER WEEK.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.555
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT!

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.057
THEY CAN'T HANDLE
REAL MONSTERS,

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.691
WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T
HANDLE A REAL DUEL,

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.260
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE
NO REAL ABILITIES.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.628
THEY'RE BEYOND TEACHING.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:23.329
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.898
BUT I THINK THE WAY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DUELING

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:26.166
IS KINDA MESSED UP.

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.435

I DIDN'T REALIZE

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:30.637
YOU WERE ON THE
DUEL ACADEMY FACULTY.

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:31.638
OH, WAIT, YOU'RE NOT.

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:32.872

WHAT YOU THINK!

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.674
NOW SCUTTLE ALONG
AND REPAIR

WHATEVER IT IS
YOU CAME HERE TO REPAIR.

00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:39.179
I WAS ASKED TO FIX SOMETHING
CALLED THE RUDOLPH HEITMANN.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:40.447
DO YA' KNOW WHERE THAT IS?

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:42.282
WAH?! THE
RUDOLPH HEITMANN?

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.817
YEAH. APPARENTLY
IT HAS

Luna: HEITMANN'S
THE VICE CHANCELLOR.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.029
Leo: AND HE'S PLANNING ON
EXPELLING OUR ENTIRE CLASS
FROM THE ACADEMY.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:57.897
HE THINKS WE'RE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH TO BE HERE.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.600
HE ISN'T
GIVING US A CHANCE.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.970
OKAY...I THINK I GET IT NOW...

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.339
I WAS SENT HERE
TO FIX SOMETHING.

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:08.074
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:10.243
HEY, HEITMANN,
YA WANNA DUEL?

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.112
IF I WIN,
THEN THIS
ENTIRE CLASS

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.813
GETS TO STAY AT
DUEL ACADEMY.

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:16.015
AND IF YOU LOSE,
THEN THESE PEONS

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.151
WILL SPEND THE REST OF
THE SEMESTER SHOPPING AROUND

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.587

WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM!

IS IN YUSEI'S HANDS...

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:29.229
DO YOU THINK HE CAN HANDLE
THE VICE CHANCELLOR?

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:32.232
WELL, UM, HE ONCE
SAVED THE ENTIRE CITY

HE CAN HANDLE HEITMANN.

DOING THIS, YUSEI.

YEARS AND YEARS AGO.

HAD NEVER SEEN ONE.

RARE N' LEGENDARY CARDS,

HAVE THEM?

ITS PRIVILEGES!

00:13:16.763 --> 00:13:19.032

PASSED DOWN OVER THE YEARS

THIS IS POWER, STUDENTS!

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.738

WEAK MONSTERS
IN YOUR DECK,

BUT IF THAT'S
ALL YOU HAVE,

IF THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE, THEN...

00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.546
[LAUGHS] WELL,
THAT'S PRECISELY WHY

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.581

FROM DUEL ACADEMY,

POWERFUL MONSTERS

00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:42.355
DOESN'T GUARANTEE YOU
A WIN...

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:44.190

WOULD KNOW THAT.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.359
HA! MAYBE NOT,
BUT NOT HAVING THEM

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:48.094
GUARANTEES YOU
CERTAIN DEFEAT.

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:50.330
TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT,
I WILL NOW COMMENCE

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.898
A FULL FRONTAL ASSAULT.

00:13:51.898 --> 00:13:53.132
BRACE YOURSELF, YUSEI.

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:54.534
I'LL BRACE MYSELF
ALL RIGHT,

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:56.069
BY ACTIVATING
MY TRAP CARD.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.603
TUNER'S BARRIER!

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.505
THIS FORMS
A PROTECTIVE SHIELD

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.040
AROUND MY TUNER MONSTER.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.642
NOW YOU CAN'T DAMAGE IT.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.411
HA! CUTE TRY, BUT
IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD!

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.846
FOR WHEN
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.481
BATTLES A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:11.718
YOU STILL
TAKE THE DIFFERENCE
AS DAMAGE!

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:13.353
ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:16.856
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM NUMBER 1,
ATTACK FLAMVELL GUARD!

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.160
AND THEN NUMBER 2
FOLLOWS UP

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.229
WITH A SMASHING ATTACK
OF ITS OWN!

00:14:25.765 --> 00:14:28.067
NOW POOR NUMBER 3
IS FEELING LEFT OUT!

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.335
I CAN'T HAVE THAT!

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:32.572
GO FORTH, NUMBER 3,
SMASH AWAY!

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.112
Akiza: HE LOST
3,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:14:39.112 --> 00:14:40.380
All: COME ON, YUSEI!

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.215
AND NOW, TO COMPLETE
MY LESSON,

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.385
I'M ACTIVATING
THE LEVEL THUNDER
SPELL CARD!

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.853
THIS SPELL SLAMS YOU
WITH DAMAGE

00:14:46.853 --> 00:14:48.955
EQUAL TO THE TOTAL LEVEL
OF MY MONSTERS

00:14:48.955 --> 00:14:50.923
MULTIPLIED BY 100.

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.159
[THINKING] EACH
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEM
IS A LEVEL 8.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:55.395
SO THE TOTAL IS 24.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.231
GUESS WE'RE GETTING
EXPELLED AFTER ALL.

00:14:58.231 --> 00:15:00.400
I HOPE HE'S GOT SOMETHING
IN PLACE FOR THIS.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.201
IF HE DOESN'T,
THIS IS OVER, RIGHT?

00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:03.236
HUH!!

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.238
COME ON, YUSEI,
DON'T LET HIM WIN!

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.373
HA! COMBOS LIKE THIS
ARE WHY YOU CAN'T

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:09.942
FIDDLE AROUND WITH
PUNY LITTLE MONSTERS!

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.145
YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG
TO SURVIVE!

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:14.380
Both: LOOK OUT, YUSEI!

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.816
THIS COULD BE IT...

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.818
♪ ♪

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.760
♪ ♪

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:33.466
YUSEI, YOU ARE ABOUT
TO BE DISMISSED!

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.500
Both: INCOMING!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.601
NOT SO FAST,

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.603
BY DISCARDING HANEWATA
FROM MY HAND,

00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.106
I CAN PROTECT MYSELF!

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.074
THERE WE GO.
I KNEW IT WASN'T OVER YET!

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:45.077
SO YOU HELD ON WITH THE HELP
OF ANOTHER FEEBLE MONSTER.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.512
YOU'RE QUITE
PERSISTENT, YUSEI.

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:48.281
YOU HAVE THE TENACITY
OF A COCKROACH.

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.283
BUT I STEP
ON COCKROACHES!

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:52.018
IT'S GOOD HE HELD
OUT N' ALL, BUT...

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:53.419
THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING...

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:54.954
Luna: I KNOW...

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.155
DON'T WORRY, GUYS.

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.191
I'VE GOT A COUPLE
LESSONS OF MY OWN.

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:00.626
YOU'VE MADE
YOUR CASE, HEITMANN,

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.761
BUT I'M NOT BUYING IT.

00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:04.564
AND NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:06.933
HA. WITH WHAT?!

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:09.702
YOU'VE GOT 3 GOLEMS
TOWERING OVER YOU!

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.170
AND THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN THEIR WAY

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.306
IS ONE LOWLY LITTLE
TUNER MONSTER!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:17.210
OR, OH, I GET IT--
IS THIS A LESSON
ON LOSING GRACEFULLY?

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.678
I'M AFRAID NOT!

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.715
I'M ACTIVATING
CARDS OF CONSONANCE!

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:24.183
BY SENDING
ONE TUNER MONSTER

00:16:24.183 --> 00:16:25.751
FROM MY HAND
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.053
I CAN USE THIS SPELL
TO DRAW

00:16:27.053 --> 00:16:28.521
2 MORE CARDS
FROM MY DECK!

00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:30.289
I WAS UNAWARE
THAT TUNERS COULD BE

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:31.724
USED IN
SUCH A MANNER.

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:35.027
BAD NEWS, HEITMANN.

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:37.730
WHAT?
I SUMMON ECCENTRIC BOY!

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.599
AND WHEN I USE IT
TO SYNCHRO SUMMON,

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:41.367
I CAN CHOOSE THE OTHER
MONSTER I NEED

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:43.035
DIRECTLY FROM MY HAND.

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:45.438
AND I CHOOSE
TURRET WARRIOR.

00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:47.907
NOW ECCENTRIC BOY,
GIVE TURRET WARRIOR

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.075
A TUNE-UP.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.079
WHAT IN THE WHAT!?!
YOU CAN TUNE A MONSTER

00:16:53.079 --> 00:16:54.814
THAT'S NOT EVEN PRESENT
ON THE FIELD?!

00:16:55.982 --> 00:16:57.316
OF COURSE!

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.852
I WOULD THINK
A "REAL DUELIST"
WOULD KNOW THAT.

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:06.826
I SYNCHRO SUMMON
STARDUST DRAGON!

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:13.032
Dexter: AW, YEAHHH!
Bob: THIS IS THE GREATEST
DAY OF MY LIFE!

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.333
Patty: THAT DRAGON
IS AWESOME!

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.002
YEAH, BUT
THE ANCIENT GEAR GOLEMS

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.403
HAVE MORE
ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.871
IF THERE'S NOT MORE
TO HIS STRATEGY,

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.573
YUSEI'S OUT
IN THE NEXT MOVE.

00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:23.476
[THINKING] I KNEW
HE WASN'T ALL THAT.

00:17:23.476 --> 00:17:26.679
YUSEI, IF THEY COULD,
MY ANCIENT GEAR GOLEMS

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:29.515
WOULD LAUGH AT YOUR SAD,
INFINITESIMAL DRAGON.

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:31.551
THAT LIZARD'S NO MATCH
FOR THEIR MIGHT!

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.252
Yusei: WRONG AGAIN,
HEITMANN.

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:34.287
WHAT?!

00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:35.588
YOU'RE RIGHT
THAT HEAD TO HEAD

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:37.189
STARDUST DRAGON
COULDN'T DESTROY

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.091
ONE OF YOUR
ANCIENT GEAR GOLEMS.

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.459
SO IT'S A GOOD THING
FOR ME,

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.594
THERE'S A LOT MORE
TO DUELING

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:43.229
THAN STRAIGHT-UP
BATTLES.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:44.263
FROM MY HAND, I PLAY

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.532
THE VARIETY COMES OUT
SPELL CARD!

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:47.967
BY RETURNING
STARDUST DRAGON

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:48.968
TO MY DECK...

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.870
I CAN SUMMON
AS MANY TUNER MONSTERS

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.772
FROM MY GRAVEYARD
AS I WANT.

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.307
AS LONG AS THEIR
COMBINED LEVELS

00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:56.342
EQUAL STARDUST DRAGON'S.

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.343
WAIT, WHAT?!

00:17:57.343 --> 00:18:00.246
I RESURRECT
ECCENTRIC BOY,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:02.748
HANEWATA,
AND DEBRIS DRAGON!

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.153
ABSURD!
YOU'RE DOING THIS

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.721
ALL BACKWARDS, YUSEI!

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:09.855
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EMPLOY

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:11.357
YOUR LOWLY LITTLE
PEON MONSTERS

00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:13.326
TO PAVE THE WAY TOWARD
A HIGH-LEVEL SUMMON,

00:18:13.326 --> 00:18:15.695
YOU DON'T SUMMON A MONSTER
LIKE STARDUST DRAGON

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.263
AND THEN--[GASP]

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.599
THOSE ARE--...I KNOW
THOSE MONSTERS!

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.600
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.568
THESE MONSTERS ABOUT
TO TAKE YOU DOWN,

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:25.071
THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS
YOU WANT TO EXPEL.

00:18:25.071 --> 00:18:27.607
THEY'RE THE MONSTERS
YOU CALLED "WORTHLESS."

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:28.874
HERE!

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.744
Luna: COME ON, SLY,
GIVE HIM ONE OF
YOUR CARDS, TOO.

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.848
THANKS, YOU GUYS.

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.417
WITH ALL THE CARDS
THAT YOU'RE LENDING ME,

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:41.153
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN LOSE.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.755
Patty: DO YOUR BEST, YUSEI.

00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:44.490
Leo: GOOD LUCK.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.425
I DON'T CARE HOW MANY
CARDS YOU HAVE.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:47.860
WEAKNESS IS
STILL WEAKNESS!

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.564
AND THOSE WEAK MONSTERS CANNOT
TAKE ON MY POWERFUL GOLEMS!

00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:52.832
WHICH IS
WHY THEY WON'T BE

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.233
TAKING ON YOUR GOLEMS.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.836
I ACTIVATE THE TUNER'S
EXPLOSION TRAP!

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:59.138
BY DESTROYING
THE SAME AMOUNT OF
MONSTERS ON MY FIELD

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.773
AS YOU HAVE
ON YOUR FIELD,

00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:02.274
I CAN DESTROY
YOUR MONSTERS

00:19:02.274 --> 00:19:03.743
AT THE SAME TIME!

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.213
WHAAAA--?!
IMPLAUSIBLE!

00:19:11.117 --> 00:19:12.652
AAH!

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.224
INCONCEIVABLE!

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:21.227
ALL 3 GOLEMS CRASHING DOWN
AT THE SAME TIME!

00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:23.229
IT'S UNFATHOMABLE!

00:19:23.229 --> 00:19:26.132
AND NOW FOR EVERY
MONSTER JUST DESTROYED,

00:19:26.132 --> 00:19:28.401
YOU TAKE 1,000 POINTS
OF DAMAGE!

00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:30.569
AAH!
AND SINCE DEBRIS DRAGON

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:32.238
IS STILL HANGIN' AROUND
ON THE FIELD,

00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:34.573
IT GOES IN
FOR A DIRECT ATTACK!

00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:39.045
AAAAH!

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.151
Leo, Luna, and Dexter:
ALL RIGHT!

00:19:45.151 --> 00:19:46.752
Bob: HE DID IT.
I KNEW HE COULD!

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.654
AND HE DID IT WITH
OUR MONSTERS, GUYS.

00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:51.257
OUR MONSTERS DEFEATED
THE VICE CHANCELLOR!

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.758
[CHEERING]

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:57.129
IMPOSSIBLE...HOW COULD I
FALTER WITH MY VANGUARD DECK?

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.431
NEVER COULD I HAVE
EVER CONCEIVED

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:01.534
THAT SUCH LOW-LEVEL MONSTERS
COULD HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.669
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THAT'S WHY
YOU LOST, HEITMANN,

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.871
BECAUSE YOU
UNDERESTIMATED
MY MONSTERS.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.574
JUST LIKE
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
THIS ENTIRE CLASS.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.643
THEY MAY NOT
HAVE MASTERED
THE HIGHER-UPS YET,

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.977
BUT THEY BELIEVE
IN THEIR CARDS

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.646
AND THEY BELIEVE
IN THEMSELVES.

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.549
AND THAT'S WHAT
DUELING'S ALL ABOUT.
YOU AGAIN.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:19.051
IF I COULD'VE DEMONSTRATED
THAT MYSELF, I WOULD'VE,

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.020
BUT I'M JUST
AN ADMINISTRATOR.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.588
CHANCELLOR!

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:24.590
CHANCELLOR?
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.892
PERSONALLY, I WANTED
TO FIRE HEITMANN, BUT

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.729
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST DONORS
JUST HAPPENS TO BE HIS MOTHER...

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.330
WHO HE STILL LIVES WITH.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.431
IF YOU WERE
TEETERING ON

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.532
THE VERGE OF
FIRING ME, SIR,

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:34.533
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST COME TO ME

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.735
AND SAY
SOMETHING?

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:38.471
I TRIED, BUT, AS USUAL,
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:40.139
I UNDERSTAND.
IT SEEMS THAT

00:20:40.139 --> 00:20:41.941
I'VE BEEN AN
IMPUDENT BLOCKHEAD.

00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:43.743
Students: YOU'RE THE BEST!
YUSEI!

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.945
I'M STILL THE ONE
IN CHARGE OF EXPULSIONS!

00:20:47.113 --> 00:20:49.215
AND I AM REVOKING
ALL OF YOURS.

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:50.750
Students: HOORAY!

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.918
DUEL ACADEMY
GIVES YOU THANKS, YUSEI.

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.024
WELL, IT SEEMS
YOUR FRIEND MARTHA

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:02.161
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT
YOUNG MAN...HE IS SPECIAL.

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:04.530
YES. NOW IF ONLY
I COULD GET HIM
