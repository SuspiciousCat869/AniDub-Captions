AS MUCH AS I HATE TO
ADMIT IT, HE'S RIGHT.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.635
IF THE GHOST HAS
ENOUGH CARDS IN HIS DECK

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.170
TO KEEP REBUILDING THAT THING,

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.073
HE CAN JUST KEEP BLOCKING
ALL MY ATTACKS!

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.709
TALK ABOUT
A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

[SINISTER CHUCKLE]

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.247
YOU'LL SOON BE GOING DOWN
LIKE ALL THE REST, YUSEI!

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.649
THE MOMENT YOU LOSE
IS THE MOMENT YOU CRASH!

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.651
SO IS THAT WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT FOR YOU--

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:21.521
BULLYING RANDOM DUELISTS
YOU FIND ON THE ROAD?!

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:22.722
HA--BULLYING?

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:25.725
OF COURSE NOT, THAT'S
JUST AN ADDED BONUS...

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.460
DESSERT FOR AFTER
I ACHIEVE

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.329
WHAT I'VE REALLY
SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH!

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.131
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:34.934
I'M TALKING ABOUT USELESS LITTLE
THINGS CALLED SYNCHRO MONSTERS!

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:37.804
THAT'S WHY I CRUISE
THE ROADS AT NIGHT, YUSEI,

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:39.139
SO THAT I CAN FIND THEM

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.241
AND RID THE WORLD
OF THE WRETCHED THINGS!

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:44.043
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO RID THE WORLD OF YOURS!

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:45.845
WATCH THE SYNCHRO SLAYER
AT WORK!

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:47.580
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.715
OH, AM I?

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:51.050
MACHINE EMPEROR INFINITY...
DEMONSTRATE!

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.786
I ACTIVATE
YOUR SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:03.196
[ROAR]

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:06.099
IT'S TOO LATE, YUSEI,
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.734
YOUR DRAGON IS
ABOUT TO BECOME

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:09.202
JUST ANOTHER GEAR
IN MY MACHINE!

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:10.203
NO!

00:11:10.203 --> 00:11:12.805
[ROAR]

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.579
DID YOU SEE THAT--
HIS MONSTER HAS BEEN--

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:21.014
HAS BEEN TRAPPED!

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.217
STARDUST DRAGON, NO! AH!

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:27.387
THE GHOST...
WATCH OUT...

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.189
SYNCHRO'S ARE USELESS...

TO WARN ME...

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.159
THIS IS WHAT HE MEANT.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:36.863
SYNCHRO'S ARE USELESS BECAUSE
THE GHOST CAN CAPTURE THEM!

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.098
OH, THEY'RE NOT USELESS,
AT LEAST NOT TO ME,

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:41.434
BECAUSE NOW THAT
YOUR STARDUST DRAGON
IS MINE...

00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:44.170
HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE MINE, TOO.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.405
THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI!

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:46.906
THANKS TO YOUR
SYNCHRO MONSTER,

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:49.776
MY MACHINE EMPEROR NOW
GAINS 2,500 EXTRA POINTS

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:51.444
TO DO DAMAGE
TO YOU WITH!

[SINISTER CHUCKLE]

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:55.949
OH, NO-- IT ABSORBED ALL OF
STARDUST DRAGON'S STRENGTH?!

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.617
THIS IS NOT GOOD!

00:11:57.617 --> 00:12:00.420
ALRIGHT THEN,
MACHINE EMPEROR...

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.488
ATTACK HIS LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY!

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.959
TELL ME HOW IT FEELS, YUSEI,

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:09.095
TO HAVE YOU OWN MONSTER
PLAY A PART IN YOUR DEMISE!

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.765
IF YUSEI
TAKES THIS HIT,

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.367
HE'S GONNA HIT
THE ASPHALT!

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.303
THEN HE'D BETTER DO
SOMETHING AND QUICK!

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.663
THERE'S NO ESCAPE,
YUSEI!

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:47.867
YOUR FATE IS TO LOSE
AT THE HANDS OF MY
MACHINE EMPEROR!

00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:53.973
WRONG!
I PLAY SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:57.277
THANKS TO THIS TRAP CARD,
WHEN YOUR MONSTER ATTACKS,

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.412
I CAN NEGATE THAT ATTACK
AND THEN I'M ALLOWED

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:02.148
TO PLACE IT RIGHT
BACK DOWN ON THE FIELD
TO USE AGAIN!

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.822
FINE...
YOU SURVIVED THIS ROUND.

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:13.426
I PLACE TWO CARDS
FACEDOWN AND END
MY TURN!

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:16.796
THEN IT'S MY MOVE!

00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:20.633
FIRST I'LL SUMMON BICULAR
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:25.338
AND THEN I'LL END MY TURN
WITH A FACEDOWN CARD!

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:27.040
[AMUSED CHUCKLE]

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.342
YOU CALL THAT A MOVE?!

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:30.810
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
IN MY HAND

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.779
THAT CAN BEAT
THAT EMPEROR.

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.715
FOR NOW, I JUST HAVE
TO TRY AND HOLD ON.

00:13:35.715 --> 00:13:39.986
MY TURN!
AND I'LL START IT OFF

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.555
BY PLAYING
THE TRAP WISE A 3!

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.258
WITH THIS CARD, BY
SENDING THE WISEL ATTACK

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:47.026
I HAVE ON THE FIELD
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:51.097
I CAN SUMMON WISEL
ATTACK 3 FROM MY HAND!

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.810
WHY WOULD I DO
SUCH A THING?

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.211
YOU GUESSED IT!

00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:10.049
BECAUSE WISEL 3 RAISES
MY EMPEROR'S ATTACK
POINTS EVEN MORE!

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.485
AND NOW I'LL HAVE HIM
USE THOSE ATTACK
POINTS...

00:14:12.485 --> 00:14:14.954
TO LAY WASTE TO YOU!

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:20.159
AH! I REACTIVATE
SCRAP-IRON SCARECROW!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.703
[AMUSED CHUCKLE]

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.272
I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG YUSEI CAN
HOLD ON LIKE THIS.

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:34.607
BUT WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO?

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:37.577
HIS BEST MONSTER HAS BEEN
EFFECTIVELY TURNED AGAINST HIM!

00:14:37.577 --> 00:14:40.513
PLAYING THAT TRAP'S
HIS ONLY CHANCE TO SURVIVE!

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.181
ACTUALLY, I GOTTA
BAD FEELING

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:45.017
THAT TRAP MIGHT NOT BE
ENOUGH, JACK...

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.253
GHOST SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:50.690
[SINISTER LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.559
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D
FALL FOR THE SAME TRAP TWICE!

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.162
I ACTIVATE
THE TRAP BATTLE RETURN!

00:14:56.162 --> 00:14:59.098
THANKS TO THIS CARD,
BY CUTTING THE ATTACK
POINTS OF THE MONSTER

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.100
I JUST TARGETED IN HALF,

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.170
I'M ALLOWED TO ATTACK
WITH HIM ONCE AGAIN!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.638
WHAT?

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:10.743
MACHINE EMPEROR WISEL,
GO!

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.715
NO.

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:17.083
YUSEI'S IN FOR IT NOW--

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.218
THAT TRAP A' HIS ONLY
WORKS ONCE PER TURN!

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:20.286
YUSEI!

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:29.862
AH! UH! AH!

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:32.799
AND DON'T FORGET WISEL
3'S SPECIAL ABILITY...

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.434
SINCE ITS ATTACK POINTS
ARE GREATER

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.202
THAN YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:39.639
THE DIFFERENCE IS
DEALT TO YOU AS DAMAGE!

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.175
NOW...
I PLAY A SPECIAL ABILITY!

00:15:42.175 --> 00:15:44.610
THE ABILITY OF BICULAR!

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.579
YOU SEE, WHEN HE'S
DESTROYED IN BATTLE,

00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.848
I'M THEN ALLOWED TO
SUMMON THIS GUY!

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:50.049
UNICYCULAR!

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:52.318
WHATEVER--
ON TO MY NEXT MOVE!

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:54.654
I ACTIVATE MY FACEDOWN,
TRAP RECYCLE!

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:57.924
TRUE, I MUST GET RID
OF A CARD IN MY HAND
TO USE THIS TRAP,

00:15:57.924 --> 00:15:59.692
BUT THEN I GET TO
RETURN TO MY HAND

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.093
A TRAP
FROM MY GRAVEYARD!

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.862
AND THE TRAP
I WANT BACK IS...

00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:04.497
BATTLE RETURN!

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:07.567
BUT IT CAN'T WAGE BATTLE
JUST YET.

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:10.336
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO PLACE THIS CARD
BACK ON THE FIELD

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.405
UNTIL MY NEXT TURN.

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:15.708
THEN THAT MEANS YUSEI HAS THIS
ONE TURN TO TURN THINGS AROUND

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:17.743
OR HE'S DONE FOR, FER SURE!

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.579
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, CROW.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:22.615
BECAUSE ONCE THAT BATTLE
RETURN CARD IS LAID DOWN...

00:16:22.615 --> 00:16:25.718
YUSEI'S LIFE POINTS WILL BE
GOING DOWN THE TUBES!

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.421
AH. HERE GOES!

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.792
AH...

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.360
[AMUSED CHUCKLE]

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.028
IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE
DIDN'T GET THE CARD

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:38.231
THAT THEY WERE
HOPING FOR.

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:39.532
WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW,
YUSEI?

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:42.101
AFTER ALL, THERE ARE
NO SECOND CHANCES
IN A DUEL!

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:44.070
WAIT A SECOND.
THERE ARE!

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.506
I ACTIVATE THE EFFECT
OF SPEED WORLD 2!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.107
THANKS TO THE FIELD SPELL,

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:49.609
BY REMOVING
SEVEN SPEED COUNTERS,

00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:53.312
I CAN DRAW ONE MORE CARD
FROM MY DECK!

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.781
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CARD
THAT CAN HELP ME...

00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:59.285
BUT I'LL NEED ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET TO DRAW IT!

00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.224
WHOA!

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:08.661
WHY ARE OUR
MARKS GLOWING?

00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:10.096
HOW STRANGE...

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:11.264
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
YOU GUYS?

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:13.399
I'M NOT SURE
BUT I THINK IT'S YUSEI.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:14.934
I THINK HE NEEDS OUR HELP!

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.141
THE MARK OF
THE CRIMSON DRAGON!

00:17:22.141 --> 00:17:25.478
IT'S LENDING ME ITS POWER
FOR THIS ONE LAST DRAW!

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:28.648
GHOST! YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE
THAT THE POWER OF
SYNCHRO MONSTERS

00:17:28.648 --> 00:17:30.683
CAN NEVER BE CONTAINED!

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:33.753
AND RIGHT HERE
IS THE PROOF!

00:17:33.753 --> 00:17:35.588
NOW WATCH!

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:39.592
I SUMMON THE MAJESTIC DRAGON!

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.398
AND NEXT I ACTIVATE
SYNCHRO MATERIAL!

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:48.234
THANKS TO THIS TRAP,
I CAN NOW SYNCHRO SUMMON
WITH MONSTERS

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.969
THAT ARE ON YOUR SIDE
OF THE FIELD!

00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:52.638
MONSTERS LIKE
THE STARDUST DRAGON!

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.073
WHAT?!

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.509
THAT'S RIGHT!
RETURN, STARDUST!

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.911
NO! NO!
THIS ISN'T FAIR--

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.781
I CAPTURED HIM!
HE'S MINE!

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:04.216
NOT ANYMORE HE'S NOT.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.922
[ROAR]

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.123
HE GOT HIM BACK!

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:12.892
AND THAT'S
JUST THE START!

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:19.031
HMM. NOW, STARDUST DRAGON,
TUNE WITH UNICYCULAR
AND MAJESTIC DRAGON!

00:18:23.636 --> 00:18:27.273
GHOST, YOU CALLED SYNCHRO
MONSTERS WRETCHED LITTLE THINGS

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.108
THAT THE WORLD
SHOULD BE RID OF.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.444
WELL, NOW IT'S THEIR TURN
TO RESPOND,

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.246
AND THEY'LL RESPOND...
WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT!

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:37.717
SHOW HIM WHAT I MEAN,
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON!

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:46.025
AND DON'T FORGET,
SINCE MACHINE EMPEROR
LOST STARDUST,

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.661
HE ALSO LOST THAT
ATTACK POINT BONUS!

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:49.895
DON'T YOU FORGET-

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:51.731
I STILL HAVE
WISEL GUARD 3...

00:18:51.731 --> 00:18:53.799
AND THANKS TO
HIS SPECIAL ABILITY,

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.469
ANY ATTACK YOU
TRY TO WAGE WILL
JUST BE BLOCKED!

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.137
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG,

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:01.741
BECAUSE MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON
NEGATES THE SPECIAL ABILITY
OF YOUR WISEL GUARD.

00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:03.042
SO WHAT--

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:04.810
YOUR ATTACK'S STILL
NOT STRONG ENOUGH

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.846
TO DEFEAT ALL THE PARTS
OF MY EMPEROR!

00:19:06.846 --> 00:19:08.214
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE--

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:10.583
AFTER ALL, HE'S A COMBO
MONSTER, NOT A SYNCHRO.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.952
I'M AFRAID YOUR MACHINE
EMPEROR'S GREATEST STRENGTH

00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:15.221
IS ALSO
HIS GREATEST WEAKNESS.

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.822
AH! NO!
YOU'RE WRONG!

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.291
ATTACK HIM AND YOU'LL
ONLY DESTROY ONE PART--

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:21.260
BUT IF IT'S
THE RIGHT PART...

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.629
ALL THE OTHERS
WILL GO WITH IT!

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:27.366
MAJESTIC STAR DRAGON--
ATTACK!

00:19:34.273 --> 00:19:39.245
ARGH! AAH! OH!

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.381
AAH!

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.717
[CRASH]

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:45.885
GHOST!

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.557
OH, NO!

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:53.659
QUICK! WE GOTTA
GET DOWN THERE!

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.293
HMM. YUSEI FUDO.

00:20:27.293 --> 00:20:29.261
IT HAS TO BE.

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:32.498
WELL, WELL, THIS SHOULD
CERTAINLY MAKE THINGS
INTERESTING.

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:34.233
[AMUSED LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:40.840
GHOST, ARE YOU OKAY?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.576
COME ON, LET'S HELP HIM UP
AND GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.244
YAH!

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.714
OH.
OR MAYBE A MECHANIC?

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:50.449
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:54.420
AM I SEEING WHAT I THINK
I'M SEEING?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.622
SO GHOST...
WAS A ROBOT?

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:58.290
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.359
WE NEED
SOME ANSWERS.

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.400
Yusei: GOOD TO SEE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER, TRUDGE.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.302
Trudge: HEY, I'M
JUST HAPPY YOU GUYS

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.871
FINALLY CAUGHT UP
WITH THE GHOST.

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:13.405
SO WHADAYA THINK?

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.241
WELL, FROM THE LOOKS OF
THESE PICTURES YOU TOOK,

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.843
I'D SAY WHAT WE HAVE
HERE IS A DUEL BOT.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:20.980
SECTOR SECURITY HAS
BEEN EXPERIMENTING
WITH ROBOTICS.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.816
DUEL BOTS ARE AT THE
VERY CUTTING EDGE OF
THOSE EXPERIMENTS.

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:25.785
SO HOW COME THIS
ONE GOT LOOSE?

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.219
DON'T KNOW.
BUT MY HUNCH IS

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:28.954
SOMEONE
STOLE A PROTOTYPE
FROM HEADQUARTERS

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:32.091
AND THEN THEY MUST'VE
SOMEHOW REPROGRAMMED IT.

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:33.859
NOW THE QUESTION IS WHY.

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:36.762
I ONLY WISH WE COULD
CHECK THE BOT'S
MEMORY CHIP.

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.264
ALREADY DID THAT, TRUDGE.

00:21:38.264 --> 00:21:40.132
ONLY PROBLEM IS
IT HAD NOTHING ON IT.

00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:41.433
MY GUESS?

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:44.637
THE GHOST'S MEMORY SYSTEMS
WERE SET TO AUTOMATICALLY ERASE

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.338
IF IT LOST A DUEL.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:49.508
YOU KNOW IT'S A CRIME TO
TAMPER WITH EVIDENCE!

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.143
OH, GIVE IT A REST,
WOULD YA?

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.778
IF NOT FOR US,
SECTOR SECURITY

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:54.980
WOULD STILL
BE TRYING TO
CATCH THE GHOST!

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.949
THAT'S RIGHT--
NO ONE TRIES HARDER!

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:57.950
[DEEP SIGH]

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:00.953
WOW, A DUELING ROBOT--
SOOOO AWESOME!

00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:03.589
LEO, THAT THING DID
A LOT OF DAMAGE!

00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:04.857
OH, YEAH...

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:07.059
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS ALL THAT WEIRD STUFF

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.228
THE GHOST WAS SAYING
ABOUT SYNCHRO MONSTERS--

00:22:09.228 --> 00:22:10.396
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:11.564
I DON'T KNOW.

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:13.165
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT IS CERTAIN

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.835
IS THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY
OUT THERE WHO'S UP TO NO GOOD.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:17.102
I AGREE, JACK.

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:19.405
AND IF THAT MEANS THAT OUR CITY
IS IN DANGER...

00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:21.540
WE HAVE TO BE READY
TO DEFEND IT!

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.008
HMM.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.476
HMM.

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:26.912
AND BE READY AT ALL TIMES.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.548
BECAUSE I HAVE A BAD FEELING
THAT THIS DUEL BOT

00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:30.950
WAS JUST THE BEGINNING,

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:34.954
AND FROM HERE ON OUT, THINGS
ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
