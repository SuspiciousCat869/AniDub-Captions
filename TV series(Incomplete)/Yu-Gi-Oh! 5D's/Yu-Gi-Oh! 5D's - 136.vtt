BECAUSE NOW, BY REMOVING TWO

SYNCHROS' LEVELS
TIMES ONE HUNDRED!

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.634

THE LEVEL 12 RED NOVA DRAGON AND

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:05.238
THE LEVEL 8 BLACK-WINGED DRAGON,

SHOOTING STAR DRAGON NOW GAINS
2000 PROTECTIVE POINTS.

AND IF YA DO THE MATH,

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.680
THAT'S MORE THAN YOUR ASTRO
MEKANIKLE'S ATTACK POINTS.

00:05:13.747 --> 00:05:17.217
BUT TWIN SOUL IS DOUBLE TROUBLE
BECAUSE IT HAS A SECOND EFFECT.

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:20.253

ITS DESTRUCTION IS NEGATED!

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.547
SO YOUR TRAP CARD
DEALT ME A BIT OF DAMAGE,

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:50.217
BUT THAT IS NOTHING
COMPARED TO THE DAMAGE

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.252

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.756

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.542

BECAUSE NOW, YUSEI FUDO,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:40.353

BECOME MY SYNCHRO MONSTERS!

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:45.258
BY WAY OF SOME BEDAZZLING GAME

TO INFUSE YUSEI'S SYNCHROS INTO

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:51.564

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.415
AND GAIN ATTACK POINTS EQUAL TO

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.016
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.719
SO THANK YOU FOR THE POWER
BOOST, RED NOVA DRAGON.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.593
I'D SAY THINGS CAN'T GET WORSE,
BUT I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT TO!

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.230
AND NOW, BY SENDING A MEKLORD
EMPEROR PART TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:28.001
MEKLORD ASTRO MEKANIKLE
TAKES ON THAT PART'S ABILITY.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.970
SO, GRANEL TOP 5,
YOU ARE HEREBY BANISHED

00:09:31.037 --> 00:09:32.705
AND YOUR ABILITY IS
HEREBY GAINED.

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.208

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.510
AN ADDITIONAL SYNCHRO MONSTER.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.613
SO HE'S STEALING TWO SYNCHRO
MONSTERS IN A SINGLE TURN?

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:47.120
OH, NO, BLACK-WINGED DRAGON!

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.521
SORRY WE COULDN'T
PROTECT YA, PAL.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.993
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, DON'T WE?

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.629
ASTRO MEKANIKLE GAINS
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON'S

00:09:56.696 --> 00:10:01.067
ORIGINAL ATTACK POINTS
TO USE AS ITS VERY OWN.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:03.603
BUT THAT'S OVER
10000 POWER POINTS.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.639
THAT'S RIGHT, YUSEI, AND I'M
GOING TO USE THEM ALL

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.843
TO DEFEAT YOU AND
DESTROY THIS CITY.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.244
AHH.

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:30.330
NOW, YUSEI,

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:32.031
SAY GOODBYE.

00:10:32.098 --> 00:10:35.168
MEKLORD ASTRO MEKANIKLE ATTACK!

00:10:35.235 --> 00:10:36.669
INCOMING!

00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:38.571
I CAN'T LET IT END LIKE THIS.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.940
I PLAY GUARD MASTER'S ABILITY.

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.009
YOU SEE, APORIA,

00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:45.245
IF YOU ATTACK WHEN THIS
CARD IS IN MY GRAVEYARD

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.313
I CAN SIMPLY REMOVE
IT FROM PLAY

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.082
THEN THE TARGET OF
YOUR ATTACK SWITCHES

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:52.952
TO DEFENSE MODE AND CAN'T BE
DESTROYED THIS TURN.

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:58.091
[EXPLOSIONS]

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:02.862
Lazar: OHH, HE'S STILL IN IT.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.831
YOU'RE GETTING DESPERATE, YUSEI.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:06.232
AND IN YOUR DESPERATION,

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:09.869
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT MY ASTRO
MEKANIKLE'S SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:11.237
LET ME REMIND YOU,

00:11:11.304 --> 00:11:13.072
BY SENDING A SYNCHRO MONSTER

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.742
THAT ASTRO MEKANIKLE HAS
ABSORBED TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.744
I CAN DELIVER YOU DAMAGE EQUAL

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.047
TO THAT SYNCHRO MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:22.949
AND SINCE THE MONSTER
I'LL BE BANISHING

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.921
IS RED NOVA DRAGON,
THAT DAMAGE IS 3500 POINTS.

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.559
YUSEI WON'T BE ABLE
TO WITHSTAND THIS ATTACK.

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.794
IF IT CONNECTS, HE'S GOING TO
LOSE THIS DUEL.

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:36.329
YUSEI, NO!!!

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:39.132
I PLAY MY FACEDOWN...
THE TRAP HARDSHIP!

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:42.802
THIS CARD NOW BECOMES SHOOTING
STAR DRAGON'S EQUIP CARD,

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:45.205
WHICH MEANS BY MAKING THE ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:46.606
OF SHOOTING STAR ZERO,

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:51.911
THE ATTACK YOU'RE SENDING MY
WAY DEALS ZERO DAMAGE.

00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:53.780
ALRIGHT, HE'S STILL IN THIS.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.916
FINE, I'LL JUST SEND
BLACK-WINGED TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:11:56.983 --> 00:11:59.586
AND DEAL YOU 2800
POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:01.087
BUT THAT MAKES NO SENSE,

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:03.823
YOUR ASTRO MEKANIKLE WOULD
SIMPLY LOSE ATTACK POINTS

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.158
AND DUE TO HARDSHIP'S EFFECT

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:09.963
ANY DAMAGE SENT MY
WAY WOULD BE NEGATED.

00:12:10.029 --> 00:12:15.368
BUT IF YOU INSIST, FINE, I'LL
USE HARDSHIP'S EFFECT ONCE MORE.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:19.772
I DO INSIST, YUSEI, BECAUSE THAT
TRAP IS OF NO CONCERN TO ME.

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.441
NOT WITH THIS TRAP IN PLAY!

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:22.875
INFINITE FEAST.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:25.678
NOW, YUSEI, SINCE THE SYNCHRO
MONSTER THAT WAS ABSORBED

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.814
BY ASTRO MEKANIKLE
IS IN THE GRAVEYARD,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.150
MY ASTRO MEKANIKLE IS ALLOWED TO
ABSORB WHATEVER SYNCHRO MONSTERS

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.720
I SO CHOOSE FROM
THAT SAME GRAVEYARD.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.788
WAIT, DID YOU SAY MONSTERS?

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:39.826
HE DID.

00:12:39.892 --> 00:12:41.160
AHH!

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.369
AND NOW, YUSEI,

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.804
YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL TO ALL
THE SYNCHRO MONSTERS

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:55.675
THAT MY ASTRO MEKANIKLE ABSORBED
THIS TURN TIMES 600.

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:57.810
MATH'S NOT MY STRONG SUIT,
BUT AS I RECALL,

00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.179
ASTRO MEKANIKLE ABSORBED TWO
SYNCHROS EARLIER.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.282
AND THEN THERE WERE THE TWO JUST
NOW, SO THAT MEANS...

00:13:02.348 --> 00:13:05.852
2400 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:08.121
THIS MIGHT PINCH A BIT, YUSEI.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:12.091
AAH! AAH!

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:13.092
YUSEI!
YUSEI!

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.328
OH, NO!

00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:19.565
AHH.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.301
AHH.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.303
AHH.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.971
AHH.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.307
AND NOW, DUE TO
INFINITE FEAST'S EFFECT,

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.243
I REGAIN 600 LIFE POINTS.

00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:35.248
NEXT, I PLAY ASTRO
MEKANIKLE'S ABILITY!

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.616
AS YOU MIGHT RECALL,

00:13:36.683 --> 00:13:39.719
IT TAKES THE ATTACK POINTS OF
YOUR ABSORBED SYNCHROS

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:42.088
AND GIVES THEM TO MY MONSTER.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.589
SO AFTER THAT,

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.825
ASTRO MEKANIKLE'S STILL AS
STRONG AS EVER!

00:13:45.892 --> 00:13:47.260
I END MY TURN, YUSEI.

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:49.195
AND VERY SOON AFTER,

00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:51.931
I'LL TAKE GREAT DELIGHT IN
SENDING YOU AWAY.

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.267
<i>I ONLY HAVE 400</i>
<i>LIFE POINTS LEFT.</i>

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.837
<i>I BETTER MAKE</i>
<i>A MOVE OR I'M THROUGH!</i>

00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.039
YOU MAY BE LOW ON
LIFE POINTS, YUSEI

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:01.674
BUT YOU'RE STILL
FLUSH WITH FRIENDS

00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.376
AND WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:04.410
YEAH, JACK'S RIGHT!

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:05.945
AND WE'RE NOT JUST
WITH YA IN BODY

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.081
BUT WE'RE WITH
YA IN SPIRIT, AS WELL.

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.717
MY MARK, IT'S...GLOWING.

00:14:10.783 --> 00:14:12.685
YUSEI.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.625
ALRIGHT,

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.194
IF MY FRIENDS STILL BELIEVE,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.563
THEN I BELIEVE, TOO.

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:25.131
AND NOT JUST IN MYSELF.

00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:26.899
IN MY CARDS, AS WELL.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.101
AND WITH THAT,

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.603
THERE'S ONLY ONE
THING LEFT TO SAY.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.138
LET'S...

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:34.073
REV IT UP!

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.842
I DRAW!

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:42.982
PERFECT.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.717
FIRST I PLAY THE EFFECT

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:46.552
OF THE TRAP, HARDSHIP!

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.621
WHICH MEANS BY SENDING HARDSHIP
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:14:48.688 --> 00:14:51.524
SHOOTING STAR DRAGON
IS DESTROYED.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.859
WHAT THIS?

00:14:52.925 --> 00:14:55.294
WHY WOULD YOU DESTROY YOUR ONE
AND ONLY MONSTER?

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.730
BECAUSE, IT'S NOT JUST
MY MONSTER THAT GOES,

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:59.499
BUT ALL EQUIP CARDS GO, TOO.

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.769
WAIT A SECOND, THEN THAT WOULD
MEAN THAT THE RED NOVA DRAGON

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:05.338
AND BLACK-WINGED DRAGON THAT
ASTRO MEKANIKLE ABSORBED GO

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.708
ADIOS AND ASTRO MEKANIKLE'S
ATTACK POINTS GO DOWN.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.778
ALRIGHT!

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.347
NOW THAT METAL MONOLITH
IS A LOT EASIER TO TAKE DOWN.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:17.350
YES, IF YOU HAD ANY MONSTERS
TO TAKE HIM ON WITH.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.085
BUT IN CASE YOU HAVE
A SHORT-TERM MEMORY,

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.554
YOU JUST DESTROYED THE LAST
BEAST YOU HAD.

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.423
INDEED I DID, APORIA,

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.325
WHICH IS WHY I NOW
SUMMONING MYSTIC PIPER.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.665
NOW, BY RELEASING MYSTIC PIPER,
I'M ALLOWED TO DRAW ONE CARD,

00:15:32.732 --> 00:15:34.534
AND IF THE CARD I DRAW
IS A MONSTER CARD,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.968
I GET TO DRAW AGAIN!

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:41.808
MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY,
IT'S A MONSTER.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:46.045
NOW HERE COMES MY SECOND PULL.

00:15:46.112 --> 00:15:49.315
LOOKS LIKE MY LUCK
JUST KEEPS ON COMING.

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:53.386
I NOW PLAY THE CARD I DREW,
THE TRAP, GHOUL SUMMONER!

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.688
NOW, I CAN SUMMON ONE MONSTER
THAT WAS DESTROYED

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:58.157
AND SENT TO THE GRAVEYARD
BACK TO MY FIELD

00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.560
AND THEN EQUIP
GHOUL SUMMONER TO IT.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:04.397
AND THE MONSTER I CHOOSE IS
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON!

00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:08.034
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.635
WHEN WILL YOU FINALLY LEARN?

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:12.171
YOUR SYNCHROS ARE USELESS
AGAINST MY ASTRO MEKANIKLE.

00:16:12.238 --> 00:16:13.206
CAN'T YOU SEE?

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:14.607
IF I WERE YOU,

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:17.343
I'D BE MORE CONCERNED WITH WHAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, APORIA.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.111
THE SECOND EFFECT OF
GHOUL SUMMONER.

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:21.080
IT LETS ME SUMMON A SYNCHRO FROM
MY GRAVEYARD

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.815
BY MAKING ONE DISCARD!

00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:24.951
HOWEVER, I MUST THEN TAKE
DAMAGE EQUAL

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.320
TO THAT SYNCHRO MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:30.723
NOW RETURN, RED NOVA DRAGON!

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:35.261
YOU'RE THROUGH.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.896
RED NOVA DRAGON HAS
MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:38.197
THAN YOU HAVE LIFE POINTS.

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:40.800
DOESN'T MATTER WITH BLACK-WINGED
DRAGON'S ABILITY.

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:43.769
THAT'S RIGHT, CROW, WHEN I TAKE
DAMAGE FROM AN EFFECT,

00:16:43.836 --> 00:16:46.205
I CAN PLACE A COUNTER ON
BLACK-WINGED DRAGON.

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:47.640
FOR EVERY COUNTER I PLACE,

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:49.675
BLACK WINGED DRAGON LOSES 700
ATTACK POINTS,

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:53.446
BUT ALL DAMAGE DEALT
TO ME IS NEGATED.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.548
YEAH, WAY TO GO, YUSEI.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:56.949
LOW LIFE POINTS AREN'T SO BAD

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.385
SO LONG AS BLACK WING IS THERE
TO TAKE THE HITS!

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.923
AND DON'T FORGET, YUSEI.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.825
FOR EVERY TUNER
IN THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:08.094
RED NOVA DRAGON GAINS
500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.129
AND SINCE WE HAVE TWO

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.164
MONO SYNCHRON
AND FORMULA SYNCHRON

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.935
THAT'S A BIG TIME BONUS OF 1000.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:19.105
THEN, ONCE AGAIN, DUE TO MY
GHOUL SUMMONER TRAP'S EFFECT,

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.840
BY MAKING JUST ONE DISCARD

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:23.843
I CAN BRING BACK FROM THE
GRAVEYARD SHOOTING STAR DRAGON!

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.285
AND, JUST LIKE BEFORE,

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:35.054
THE DAMAGE SENT MY WAY FOR
SUMMONING SHOOTING STAR DRAGON

00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:39.892
IS ABSORBED BY PLACING ANOTHER
COUNTER ON BLACK-WING.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.871
THEY'RE ALL HERE!

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:54.073
LIKE IT WAS MEANT TO BE!

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.809
LIKE THEY SHARE
THE SAME BOND WE DO!

00:17:56.876 --> 00:17:58.878
[ROARING]

00:18:16.228 --> 00:18:18.631
TIME FOR ME TO REV THINGS UP!

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:21.367
I NOW ACTIVATE
BLACK-WING'S ABILITY!

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.270
WITH IT, I CAN REMOVE
ALL OF BLACK-WING'S COUNTERS

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:26.238
AND THEN YOUR MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:29.675
DECREASE BY THE NUMBER OF THOSE
COUNTERS MULTIPLIED BY 700.

00:18:29.742 --> 00:18:30.876
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.045
YOUR LIFE POINTS GET HIT
BY THE SAME AMOUNT.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:37.049
SO, SINCE BLACK-WINGED DRAGON
HAS TWO COUNTERS,

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:41.120
YOUR ASTRO MEKANIKLE
LOSES 1400 ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:41.187 --> 00:18:43.856
AND NOW, APORIA,
ANOTHER 1400 POINTS

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.825
ARE DELIVERED TO YOU AS DAMAGE.

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:47.293
GO, BLACK ORB BLAST!

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.133
WAY TO GO, YUSEI.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.469
PLUS, SINCE BLACK-WING DOESN'T
HAVE ANY COUNTERS,

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.738
HE GAINS 1400 ATTACK POINTS.

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:01.374
NOW BLACK-WINGED DRAGON HAS MORE
ATTACK POINTS
