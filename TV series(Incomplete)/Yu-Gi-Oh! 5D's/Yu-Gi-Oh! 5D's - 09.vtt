[GUARD B LAUGHS]
Man: AW, MAN...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.469
AND I WAS JUST GETTING
USED TO BEING ON MY OWN.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.871
SAY, UH... IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE...

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.406
TAKE THE TOP BUNK,
WOULD YA?

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.841
I USED TO CRASH UP THERE

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.711
BUT I KEPT ROLLING OVER
IN MY SLEEP AND FALLING
OFF THE EDGE.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.614
THE NAME'S ALEX AND I'D
REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IF... HUH?

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.149
NO ARGUMENTS, NICE!

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.352
YUSEI, RIGHT?

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.321
MY LAST ROOMMATE
WAS NAMED SKELTER
OR SOMETHING,

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.890
I DON'T KNOW, HE WASN'T
MUCH OF A TALKER,
I LIKE TALKERS...

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.060
Yusei, voice-over: WAS I REALLY
ABLE TO BRING OUT
THE CRIMSON DRAGON?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.835
I MEAN IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,
AND THEN IT JUST DISAPPEARED.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:18.305
AND THAT MARK ON MY ARM,
COULD YANAGI BE RIGHT...?

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.775
YOU MUST BE
A SIGNER YUSEI!

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.043
SIGNER?

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:25.345
I HEARD ABOUT THEM
LONG AGO!

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:28.682
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A LEGEND!

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:31.485
BUT NOW, THE TALE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE STARS

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.387
MAY ACTUALLY BE TRUE!

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:36.857
YOU SEE LONG AGO
THERE WAS A TRIBE...

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:39.960
THEY WERE BRAVE AND THEY
WORSHIPPED A CRIMSON DRAGON.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.329
AND SOME COULD EVEN
SUMMON THE BEAST!

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.498
THEY'RE CALLED SIGNERS.

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:46.667
Yusei, voice-over:
BUT WHY ME, AND WHY NOW...

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.002
HEY, IS IT TRUE
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
ABOUT YOU?

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.004
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
LOTS!...

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.939
THAT YOU STOOD UP
TO TANNER
IN A DUEL.

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.375
AND THAT YOU ROYALLY
SCHOOLED HIM,
THAT'S AWESOME!

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.743
I CHALLENGED
TANNER ONCE

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:58.645
AFTER HE AND HIS
BUDDIES SORTA...

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.248
WELL, THEY LOCKED ME
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM
FOR 2 DAYS.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:02.449
B-U-UT YEAH.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.617
IT WAS
KINDA FUNNY...

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.118
I HAVE A HEADACHE, ALEX;

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.421
CAN WE SAVE
THE CHIT CHAT
FOR LATER?

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.623
SURE, OKAY...
PSST!

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.258
HEY, YUSEI!

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.561
THEY BROUGHT YOU HERE?...

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.268
YOU HERE TOO, TANNER?

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:22.402
HOW ARE YA, KID?

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.638
GLAD TO SEE YOU MADE IT
HERE IN ONE PIECE.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.106
I HATE TO INTERRUPT,

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.542
BUT DOES ANYONE
KNOW WHAT WE'RE
DOING HERE?

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.710
THIS IS
THE LONG TERM

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.845
MAXIMUM SECURITY
ZONE.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:34.548
IT MUST'VE BEEN
A PAPERWORK ERROR,

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:36.783
I WAS AT THE TOP OF
THE RELEASE LIST.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:38.819
HEY, YOU AND ME
BOTH, GRANDPA.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.189
WHAT'S GOING ON,
YUSEI, YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.158
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU WHEN
THEY BROUGHT YOU HERE TANNER?

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.260
OH, YOU KNOW...
SOME NONSENSE

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.163
ABOUT NEEDING
TO RESTRUCTURE THE SYSTEM,
BLAH BLAH BLAH....

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.733
I DON'T BELIEVE
A THING THEY SAY.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.702
SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE GUY WHO'S
IN CHARGE HERE?

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.604
ARMSTRONG'S A BULLY.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:58.939
HE DOES WHATEVER HE WANTS,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.373
HE'S A TYRANT, HE LIES,

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:01.408
AND WHEN HE'S GOT
A BONE TO PICK,

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.210
HE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO PICK IT.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.478
WHY DO YOU ASK, KID,

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:05.645
DID YOU GO
AND DO SOMETHING

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.881
TO GET ON THAT
GORDO'S BAD SIDE?

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:09.950
ARE WE HERE 'CAUSE OF YOU?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.485
[GROWLS]

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:14.421
THERE'S NO WAY THAT KID
IS A SIGNER, NO WAY!

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.857
HE'S A WORTHLESS LITTLE PUNK
FROM THE SATELLITE,

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:18.125
THAT'S ALL HE IS.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.960
I KNOW GARBAGE WHEN I SEE IT.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.562
IF HE'S A SIGNER,
I'M A SCHOOLGIRL!

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:25.265
YOU LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FOR THE MARK
OF THE DRAGON?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:26.700
YES EVERYWHERE.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.336
WELL, THEN PERHAPS WE
NEED TO CHALLENGE YUSEI

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.871
TO A DUEL OF SOME SORT.

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.306
I'LL TAKE THAT PIECE
OF GARBAGE ON RIGHT NOW!

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:36.443
ARMSTRONG, WE NEED YUSEI
TO WANT TO DUEL YOU.

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:39.646
PERHAPS THAT IS
THE KEY TO MAKING
HIS MARK RE-APPEAR.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.548
YOU MUST ARRANGE
A SITUATION

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:44.084
WHERE THAT SATELLITE
WILL WANT TO DUEL.

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.486
I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO!

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.369
Prison Announcer:
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
ITS LOCK DOWN TIME!

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:03.771
SWEET DREAMS!

00:05:05.272 --> 00:05:08.008
Alex: SO WHAT'D THEY
TELL YOU WHEN THEY
TRANSFERRED YOU?

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.144
THAT YOU WERE GONNA
BE HERE FOR A SHORT TIME

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:13.514
WHILE THEY PROCESSED
SOME PAPERWORK?

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:15.983
THAT YOU'D BE BACK
TO THE NORMAL
DETENTION AREA

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.551
BEFORE YOU KNEW IT?

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.553
THEY TELL EVERYONE THAT.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:21.555
BUT NO ONE EVER GETS
OUT OF THIS PLACE.

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:23.957
I WAS TRANSFERRED HERE
AFTER STARTING
A FOOD FIGHT

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.826
IN THE FACILITY
CAFETERIA.

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:29.029
THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED
A FEW DAYS TO COOL OFF.

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.565
THAT WAS 4 YEARS AGO.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:33.233
SO I DECIDED
TO TAKE MATTERS

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.302
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:37.905
HERE'S THE REAL REASON
I WANTED THE BOTTOM BUNK.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.208
IT'S AMAZING
WHAT YOU CAN DO...

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.576
WITH A KNIFE,
A SPOON,

00:05:42.576 --> 00:05:44.378
AND A WHOLE
LOTTA TIME YUSEI.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:50.417
Alex: WATCH OUT
FOR THE LIGHTS...

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:53.554
CHECK IT OUT.

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:55.556
THE REAL MOON,
AND EVERYTHING...

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:59.092
THAT OPENING IS
THE GATEWAY TO
FREEDOM, MY FRIEND.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:01.361
IT'S KINDA HIGH.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.830
I'VE GOT
SOME FRIENDS
ON THE OUTSIDE

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.264
COMING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.934
WHAT ABOUT
THESE BEAUTY MARKS?

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.435
AS SOON AS
YOU GET OUT OF HERE,

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:10.838
IT'LL START
TRANSMITTING A SIGNAL,
AND THEY'LL FIND YOU.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:12.172
NO THEY WON'T!

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:14.475
ONE OF MY FRIENDS
IS A HACKER
WITH SUPER SKILLS,

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:15.742
HE'LL JAM
THE SYSTEM.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.545
I'LL HAVE A WINDOW
OF ABOUT AN HOUR
AFTER I ESCAPE

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.780
TO DISAPPEAR.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.416
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
ROOMIE, ARE YOU
COMIN' WITH?

00:06:22.416 --> 00:06:24.384
THIS IS A ONE TIME
OPPORTUNITY, BUDDY,

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.353
'CAUSE ONCE
THEY REALIZE
HOW I GOT OUT,

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.489
THEY'LL SEAL
THOSE OPENINGS
AND THAT'LL BE THAT.

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:30.491
I'M IN, BUT THERE'S
JUST ONE THING.

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:32.059
HUH?

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:34.895
WELL... 2 THINGS ACTUALLY.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:36.296
RIGHT.
LET ME GUESS...

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:37.831
TANNER
AND THE OLD MAN?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.035
[SIGH]
FINE, THEY'RE IN...

00:06:42.035 --> 00:06:44.238
BUT THOSE TWO BETTER
NOT HOLD US BACK.

00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.339
I MEAN IT, MAN,

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.174
IF THEY SLOW US DOWN
AND WE BLOW
OUR CHANCE

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:49.309
AT GETTING
OUT OF HERE...

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.711
THERE WON'T
BE ANOTHER.

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:01.288
[THINKING] COME ON... WHY CAN'T
I MAKE THAT BIG LIZARD APPEAR?

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:04.625
I'VE BEEN CIRCLING THIS TRACK
FOR HOURS AND STILL NOTHING.

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.898
IT SEEMS I CAN'T
SUMMON IT BY MYSELF.

00:07:10.898 --> 00:07:14.001
MAYBE THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
THE CRIMSON DRAGON APPEAR...

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.003
IS TO DUEL YUSEI AGAIN.

00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:17.871
AND WHEN I DO,
HE'S GOING TO WISH

00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:20.040
THAT MARK OF HIS
NEVER APPEARED...

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:30.450
LUNCH TIME ALREADY?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.919
A LITTLE BIRDIE
TOLD ME YOU HAD

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.921
SOME MAGAZINES
SMUGGLED IN HERE,

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:34.988
THAT'S A NO-NO.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:37.124
MAGAZINES?

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.993
I'M NOT TOO INTERESTED
IN KEEPING UP
WITH CELEBRITIES.

00:07:39.993 --> 00:07:42.062
YOUR LITTLE BIRD'S
SINGIN' A LIE.

00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:45.966
ARE YOU
TALKING BACK TO ME?

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:47.401
LOOK, I DON'T...!
BRING 'EM, BOYS!

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:55.976
UHH.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.312
Prisoner: IS THAT BOLT TANNER?
Second prisoner:
WHAT'D THAT GUY DO?

00:07:58.312 --> 00:07:59.880
Third prisoner:
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.949
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:03.884
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:06.887
I FOUND SMUGGLED MAGAZINES
IN TANNER'S CELL!

00:08:06.887 --> 00:08:08.789
YOU ALL KNOW THAT'S
AGAINST THE RULES,

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:11.425
BUT I KNOW HE
COULDN'T'VE GOTTEN 'EM ALONE!

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:14.661
HIS ACCOMPLICE HAS ONE HOUR
TO STEP FORWARD!

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:17.664
AFTER THAT... EVERYONE HERE'S
GONNA PAY THE PRICE!

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:19.166
OH, COME ON!

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.868
YOU CAN'T PUNISH ALL OF US
FOR SOMETHIN' ONE GUY DID!

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.903
Prisoner: THAT'S RIGHT!

00:08:22.903 --> 00:08:24.271
DON'T LIKE IT?

00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.640
THEN YOU OUGHTA FIGURE OUT
WHO HELPED HIM OUT!

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.344
IF I WERE YOU MAGGOTS, I'D START
BY QUESTIONING HIS FRIENDS.

00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:45.715
Armstrong: LOOK, PEOPLE...
THERE'S NO NEED

00:08:45.715 --> 00:08:47.183
FOR EVERYONE TO SUFFER!

00:08:47.183 --> 00:08:49.319
TANNER'S FRIEND
JUST NEEDS TO 'FESS UP!

00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:51.087
IF HE DOESN'T...
I GOT NO PROBLEM

00:08:51.087 --> 00:08:53.389
PUTTING ALL OF YOU
IN PERMANENT LOCKDOWN!

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:55.258
THAT WOULD GIVE ME
TIME TO KICK BACK

00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:57.060
AND WATCH MY SOAPS!

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.162
[LAUGHS]

00:08:59.162 --> 00:09:01.297
Yusei: GET REAL!
HUH?

00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:03.599
YOU GOT SOMETHIN'
YOU WANNA SAY, NEWBIE?

00:09:05.902 --> 00:09:08.371
THERE ARE NO MAGAZINES,
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:10.506
[LAUGHS]

00:09:10.506 --> 00:09:12.108
NO MAGAZINES?

00:09:12.108 --> 00:09:15.979
SO I'M JUST PUNISHING TANNER
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT?

00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:18.047
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.

00:09:18.047 --> 00:09:19.148
BUT I KNOW THAT TANNER

00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.717
WOULDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

00:09:20.717 --> 00:09:23.119
YOU'RE ABUSING YOUR
AUTHORITY ARMSTRONG.

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:25.388
WO-AH...
YOU JUST ACCUSED ME

00:09:25.388 --> 00:09:26.689
OF BEING CRUEL N' UNFAIR,

00:09:26.689 --> 00:09:28.291
THAT REALLY HURTS
MY FEELINGS.

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.892
COME ON.
SHOW ME THE LOVE.

00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:31.928
TELL ME YOU'RE
SORRY, SATELLITE.

00:09:34.163 --> 00:09:35.565
[SNICKER]

00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:37.433
SO THAT'S
HOW YOU WANT IT.

00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:38.701
WELL, I CAN'T
JUST STAND HERE

00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:39.702
AND LET YOU ACCUSE ME

00:09:39.702 --> 00:09:41.904
OF BEING UNFAIR
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:43.473
TO PROVE THAT
I'M A REASONABLE MAN,

00:09:43.473 --> 00:09:44.807
I'LL LET YOU DUEL ME
OUT HERE

00:09:44.807 --> 00:09:46.476
WHERE YOUR FELLOW
INMATES CAN WATCH,

00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:49.045
AND IF YOU WIN, I'LL
PARDON TANNER'S OFFENSE.

00:09:49.045 --> 00:09:52.415
BUT... IF I HAPPEN
TO WIN THE DUEL...

00:09:52.415 --> 00:09:54.884
THEN NO ONE HERE BUT ME
GETS PUT IN LOCKDOWN.

00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:56.819
EH?!
[GASPS AND MURMURS]

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.022
YOU GOT A DEAL.

00:09:59.022 --> 00:10:01.591
WE DUEL TONIGHT
AT 8:30 SHARP.

00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:03.493
DON'T BE LATE!

00:10:03.493 --> 00:10:05.161
DON'T WORRY
I'LL BE THERE!

00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:07.296
WAIT, TONIGHT?!
BUT TONIGHT'S
THE NIGHT WE'RE......

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.766
Yanagi: STOP THIS,
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:11.968
PUT ME DOWN, PUT ME DOWN!

00:10:11.968 --> 00:10:16.773
CHECK IT OUT, BOSS...
CONTRABAND!

00:10:16.773 --> 00:10:19.609
THIS GUY'S GOT CARDS
STASHED ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

00:10:19.609 --> 00:10:22.345
NO! WAIT!
THOSE ARE MY TREASURES!

00:10:22.345 --> 00:10:24.614
I'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE WORLD
TO FIND THOSE!

00:10:24.614 --> 00:10:27.116
YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE THEM!

00:10:27.116 --> 00:10:30.653
[GRUNTS]
WHAT'VE I TOLD YOU CLOWNS
ABOUT CARDS?...

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:32.388
ALL RIGHT, MAGGOTS!...
THIS MIGHT BE

00:10:32.388 --> 00:10:34.891
YOUR LAST HOUR
OF FREE TIME!...

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.193
STRETCH YOUR LEGS
AND ENJOY IT
WHILE YOU GOT IT.

00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:38.895

COME ON! NO WAY!

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:41.531

THAT'S AWFUL!

00:10:41.531 --> 00:10:44.167
YUSEI... WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO SNEAK OUT TONIGHT.

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.469
WHAT GIVES, MAN!?

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:48.037
I HAD TO, ALEX.

00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:00.950
HEY, GUYS...

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.185
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:04.454
I KNOW I KNOW.

00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:05.688
YOU CAN'T DUEL HIM.

00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:07.623
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A DECK.

00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.392
IF YOU WERE HOPING
TO USE MINE,

00:11:09.392 --> 00:11:13.296
THE CHIEF TOOK
MY CARDS FROM ME
EARLIER.

00:11:13.296 --> 00:11:15.031
HE TOOK
MINE, TOO...

00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:17.066

TREASURES...

00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:19.135

ALL RIGHT?
SAY SOMETHING.

00:11:19.135 --> 00:11:20.636

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

00:11:23.139 --> 00:11:24.240
YOU GET IT, YET?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.676
ARMSTRONG DID ALL THIS
TO SET YOU UP.

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:28.244
HE FIGURED HE COULD
EITHER MAKE YOU THINK

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:30.379
HE WAS TRYING TO TURN
THE OTHERS AGAINST YOU.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:32.548
OR HE COULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE FRIENDSHIP

00:11:32.548 --> 00:11:34.050
YOU HAVE WITH TANNER...

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.853
EITHER WAY, MAN,
IT WAS CHECK MATE.

00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:39.489
HE HAD YOU IN HIS HAND
FROM THE GET-GO.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.758
LOOK, LET'S- ...
LET'S JUST ESCAPE,

00:11:42.758 --> 00:11:43.826
THE 2 OF US.

00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:44.894
THOSE GUYS
ARE DEAD WEIGHT

00:11:44.927 --> 00:11:46.362
IN THEIR CURRENT STATE.

00:11:47.497 --> 00:11:49.065
I CAN'T LEAVE THEM BEHIND.

00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:50.233
SURE YOU CAN!

00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:53.102
YOU DON'T OWE ANYBODY
ANYTHING, MAN, COME ON!

00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:55.872
I WON'T DITCH MY FRIENDS
FOR MY OWN BENEFIT...

00:11:55.872 --> 00:11:58.841
I'M NOT LEAVING THEM BEHIND
JUST TO GET AHEAD.

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.444
THAT'S JUST NOT
WHAT I'M ABOUT, ALEX.

00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:05.681
YOU'RE A REAL PIECE
O' WORK, YA' KNOW?

00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:08.084
FORGET YOU! SHEESH!

00:12:09.285 --> 00:12:11.320

YUSEI, RIGHT?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.457
A BUNCH OF US WOULD LIKE TO
SEE YOU ON THE MIDDLE WALKWAY...

00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:16.492
WE WANNA TALK
ABOUT SOMETHIN'.

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.202
Guard: IT'S TIME, KID.

00:12:28.437 --> 00:12:30.072
SO LONG, PAL.

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:31.741
THIS ISN'T GOODBYE.

00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:32.909
MOVE IT!

00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:35.611
Armstrong: WELL,
HERE HE IS...

00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:39.115
THE LITTLE PUNK
WITH THE BIG MOUTH.

00:12:39.115 --> 00:12:41.184
AND I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BACK DOWN...

00:12:41.184 --> 00:12:42.251
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.953
TO HAVE A DECK
IN THE FACILITY.

00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:45.054
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A DECK

00:12:45.054 --> 00:12:47.490
IN ORDER TO DUEL SOMEONE,
SO, UH...

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.225
SINCE YOU'RE SHOWING UP
EMPTY-HANDED...

00:12:49.225 --> 00:12:51.594
I GUESS THAT MEANS
I WIN BY FORFEIT.

00:12:51.594 --> 00:12:54.130
EASY ENOUGH!
NOW GET HIM
OUTTA MY SIGHT!

00:12:56.365 --> 00:12:59.535

WHERE'D YOU FIND THOSE?

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:04.740
YOU DON'T GET IT.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.642
YOU THINK WE'RE
A BUNCH OF PUNKS

00:13:06.642 --> 00:13:08.578
WHO'LL GLADLY
TURN ON EACH OTHER.

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:10.313
THAT'S NOT HOW IT IS...

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:13.149
WE WANNA TALK
ABOUT SOMETHIN'.

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:15.585
Prisoner: WE KNOW
THE CHIEF IS LYING
ABOUT WHAT TANNER DID,

00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:16.752
SO WE WANTED
TO SAY THANKS

00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:19.021
FOR RISKING YOUR FREEDOM
TO SAVE OURS.

00:13:19.021 --> 00:13:20.723
AND TO MAKE SURE
YOU BEAT THE CHIEF

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:23.759
TAKE THIS ...IT'S MY
MOST PRIZED POSSESSION.

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.027
CARDS ARE ILLEGAL IN HERE

00:13:25.027 --> 00:13:26.963
BUT WE'VE ALL GOT
THAT ONE FAVORITE CARD

00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:28.397
WE JUST COULDN'T
LET GO OF.

00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:30.866
I HUNG ON TO THIS ONE
FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS.

00:13:30.866 --> 00:13:33.769
IT'S A TRAP CARD, BUT
IT COULD COME IN HANDY...

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:36.606
THIS GUY MAY LOOK CUTE,
BUT HE PACKS A MEAN PUNCH.

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:39.175
THIS SPELL CARD GOT ME
OUT OF A LOTTA TOUGH JAMS.

00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:41.410
YOU CAN EQUIP THIS
ON TO ALMOST ANY MONSTER.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.646
USE THIS CARD TO PUT
ARMSTRONG IN HIS PLACE.

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:45.481
I'VE KEPT THIS CARD
HIDDEN IN MY SHOE.

00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.149
HOPEFULLY IT DON'T
SMELL TOO BAD.

00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:50.686
WITH EVERYONE
GIVING ME ONE CARD...

00:13:50.686 --> 00:13:51.988
WE CAN WIN THIS!

WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN.

00:13:58.261 --> 00:13:59.762
EVEN THOUGH
YOU'RE BREAKING A RULE,

00:13:59.762 --> 00:14:02.331
I'M WILLING TO UPHOLD
MY END OF THE DEAL.

00:14:02.331 --> 00:14:03.733

OH, THAT'S....

00:14:12.174 --> 00:14:14.143
JUST TO MAKE THINGS
A LITTLE FUN.

00:14:14.143 --> 00:14:16.312
EVERY TIME YOU TAKE
LIFE POINT DAMAGE,

00:14:16.312 --> 00:14:18.614
THAT CHAIN'LL SORTA
GIVE YOU A LITTLE TICKLE.

00:14:18.614 --> 00:14:21.284
WAIT, WHAT KIND
OF LITTLE TICKLE?

00:14:21.284 --> 00:14:23.352
YOU'LL FIND OUT SOON...

THIS SATELLITE IS SPECIAL...

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:52.069
WELL, LET'S FIND OUT
HOW SPECIAL HE IS.

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:54.204
THE FIRST MOVE'S MINE!

00:14:54.204 --> 00:14:57.908
AND I SUMMON

IN DEFENSE MODE.

YOUR MOVE, ARMSTRONG.

00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:06.216
THIS'LL BE TOUGH.

00:15:06.216 --> 00:15:07.618
SURE, HE SCRAPED
TOGETHER A DECK

00:15:07.618 --> 00:15:08.752
WITH EVERYONE'S
CARDS,

00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:09.753
BUT IT'S
A BIG PILE OF

00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:11.588
MISMATCHED MONSTERS
AND TRAPS,

00:15:11.588 --> 00:15:13.657
AND HE HASN'T
HAD MUCH TIME
TO STRATEGIZE.

00:15:13.657 --> 00:15:16.260
HE CAN PULL IT OFF,
I KNOW IT.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.262
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:15:18.262 --> 00:15:19.730
I DRAW!

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.000
I SUMMON IRON CHAIN REPAIRMAN!

00:15:26.803 --> 00:15:28.772
THIS BIG FELLA'S
WAY MORE POWERFUL

00:15:28.772 --> 00:15:31.208
THAN THAT SORRY

00:15:32.442 --> 00:15:35.512
SMASH THAT PATHETIC PHANTOM

AW, MAN... LOTTA GOOD
MY CARD DID HIM.

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:44.187
THAT PHANTOM MAY HAVE
BEEN IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:15:44.187 --> 00:15:46.790
BUT REPAIRMAN'S GOT
A SPECIAL ABILITY!...

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.759
WHEN IT DESTROYS
A MONSTER IN BATTLE,

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:52.863
IT ALSO GETS TO SLAM YOU
WITH 300 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:15:52.863 --> 00:15:55.065
BRACE YOURSELF, SATELLITE.

00:15:55.065 --> 00:15:57.234
THIS PART MIGHT BE
A LITTLE SHOCKING.

00:16:01.471 --> 00:16:02.639
WHAT IS THAT?

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.840
HE'S GETTING ZAPPED!

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:10.213
SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

00:16:10.213 --> 00:16:12.783
BUT I DID SAY IT WAS
GONNA BE SHOCKING.

00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:14.284
THESE DUEL DISKS

00:16:14.284 --> 00:16:17.087
HAVE BEEN SOUPED-UP WITH
STATIC GENERATION DEVICES.

00:16:17.087 --> 00:16:19.289
WHEN ONE OF US TAKES ANY KIND
OF LIFE POINT DAMAGE,

00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:21.959
THIS BAD BOY HERE
GENERATES A LITTLE... JOLT.

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:22.960
WHAT?!

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.162
THIS IS A CORRECTIONAL
FACILITY, YUSEI,

00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:26.363
EVERYTHING THAT
GOES ON HERE

00:16:26.363 --> 00:16:28.098
IS FOR THE BETTERMENT
OF SOCIETY.

00:16:28.098 --> 00:16:29.566
MESS UP AND DO
SOMETHING WRONG...

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:30.801
YOU GET A LITTLE SHOCK.

00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:31.802
MAYBE THAT'LL
TEACH YOU TO MAKE

00:16:31.802 --> 00:16:33.570
THE RIGHT CHOICE
NEXT TIME.

00:16:35.072 --> 00:16:37.441
I PLACE 2 CARDS
FACEDOWN...

00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:38.709
YOUR MOVE.

00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:44.147

00:16:44.147 --> 00:16:47.117
I SUMMON
THE KICK MAN

GO, YUSEI!

00:16:53.156 --> 00:16:55.392
KICK HIM INTO
THE NEXT CENTURY!

00:16:55.392 --> 00:16:56.393
HMPH!

00:16:56.393 --> 00:16:58.195
NEXT, I HOOK
THIS GUY UP

00:16:58.195 --> 00:17:00.530
WITH THE STIM-PACK
EQUIP SPELL.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.867
THIS BUFFS HIM UP
ANOTHER 700
ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:10.774 --> 00:17:12.342
ALL RIGHT, KICK MAN!

00:17:12.342 --> 00:17:14.277
TIME TO TAKE OUT
HIS MONSTER.

00:17:15.979 --> 00:17:17.280
TOO BAD THAT ATTACK'S JUST

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.816
GOING TO SLAM
INTO MY SOUL ANCHOR!

00:17:20.851 --> 00:17:22.619
NOW BY EQUIPPING
THIS TRAP CARD

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.588
ONTO IRON CHAIN REPAIRMAN,

00:17:24.588 --> 00:17:27.491
I CAN RENDER HIM
INDESTRUCTIBLE IN BATTLE!

00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:34.498
MAYBE... BUT YOU'RE
STILL TAKING DAMAGE.

00:17:35.332 --> 00:17:36.566
ALL-RIGHT!

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:39.102
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH
HE LIKES GETTING
A LITTLE JOLT.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.239
[SCREAMS, THEN LAUGHS]

00:17:49.146 --> 00:17:50.180
HUH?

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.249
OH, I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

00:17:52.249 --> 00:17:54.851
MY STATIC GENERATOR
ISN'T WORKING.

00:17:54.851 --> 00:17:57.087
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
WIRE IT RIGHT.

00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:58.689
YEAH, THAT'S IT

00:17:58.689 --> 00:18:01.725
YOU HAVE GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

00:18:01.725 --> 00:18:04.094
YOU CHEATER!
THAT DUEL DISK OF YOURS

00:18:04.127 --> 00:18:05.762
WAS NEVER HOOKED UP
TO SHOCK YOU

00:18:05.762 --> 00:18:07.431
AND YOU KNOW IT, ARMSTRONG!

00:18:07.431 --> 00:18:11.501
[LAUGHS] I RESENT WHAT
YOU'RE IMPLYING THERE, KID!

00:18:11.501 --> 00:18:14.371
I CAN'T HELP IT IF
THIS THING BREAKS, CAN I?

00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:15.739
SO FIX IT!

00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:17.274
YOU'RE A LIAR!

00:18:17.274 --> 00:18:19.042
Prisoner: I KNEW THIS
WOULDN'T BE ON THE UP AND UP!

00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:20.544
Second prisoner:
THE CHIEF'S A CHEAT!

00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:21.945
HE'S NOT
BEING FAIR, YUSEI!

00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:23.847
STOP THE DUEL,
N'WALK AWAY!

00:18:23.847 --> 00:18:26.683
HE CAN'T WALK AWAY
AND HE WON'T BE
WALKING AWAY

00:18:26.683 --> 00:18:28.018
UNLESS HE DECIDES
TO GIVE UP

00:18:28.018 --> 00:18:29.653
AND FORFEIT THE MATCH
TO ME.

00:18:29.653 --> 00:18:31.188
BUT IF HE DOES THAT
THEN HE'S GOING

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:32.355
STRAIGHT TO THE HOLE.

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:33.857
WHERE HE CAN SPEND
ALL HIS TIME

00:18:33.857 --> 00:18:36.126
THINKING ABOUT
HOW HE JUST GAVE UP!

00:18:39.362 --> 00:18:40.764
MOVING ON!...

00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:43.467
I SUMMON IRON CHAIN SNAKE!

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.839
Duel runner computer: IRON CHAIN
SNAKE IS A MONSTER CARD

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:51.308
THAT CAN EQUIP
ONTO YOUR OPPONENT'S MONSTER

00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:54.678
AND DECREASE ITS
ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS
BY 800.

00:18:54.678 --> 00:18:57.547
SO MUCH FOR YOUR KICKMAN'S
DEFENSE BOOST!

00:19:07.324 --> 00:19:08.892
AND NOW'S A PERFECT TIME

00:19:08.892 --> 00:19:11.661
FOR MY IRON CHAIN
REPAIRMAN TO ATTACK!

00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.706
DON'T FORGET... EVERY TIME
IRON CHAIN REPAIRMAN

00:19:22.706 --> 00:19:25.809
MANAGES TO DESTROY ONE OF
YOUR MONSTERS IN BATTLE...

00:19:25.809 --> 00:19:28.678
YOU GET HIT WITH A WHOPPIN'
300 POINTS OF DAMAGE!

00:19:30.947 --> 00:19:32.816
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

00:19:32.816 --> 00:19:36.052
Both: YUSEI!

00:19:36.052 --> 00:19:37.420
Armstrong: THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.490
SINCE KICK MAN WAS SADDLED
WITH IRON CHAIN SNAKE...

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.892
YOU HAVE TO SEND 3 CARDS

00:19:41.892 --> 00:19:44.227
FROM YOUR DECK
TO YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:19:44.227 --> 00:19:46.596
LOOK... IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU'RE LOSING,

00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:49.599
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW...
IF I'M BEING HARD ON YOU...

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:51.902
IT'S ALL IN THE NAME
OF REHABILITATION.

00:19:51.902 --> 00:19:55.005
YOU SEE... YOU LEFT ME
WITH NO CHOICE

00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:58.275
BUT TO USE YOU AS AN EXAMPLE
FOR THE OTHERS KID...

00:19:58.275 --> 00:20:00.577
NOW GET RID
OF THOSE 3 CARDS!

00:20:05.182 --> 00:20:07.150
[LAUGHS]

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.153
IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
STILL WIN, GET UP...

00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:12.722
IF NOT, STAY DOWN
N' WE'LL CALL IT A DAY.

00:20:12.722 --> 00:20:15.058
[LAUGHS]

00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:16.092
Both: YUSEI!

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:18.028
DON'T GIVE IN!
RISE UP, YUSEI!

00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:22.265
[PRISONERS CHANTING]
RISE UP! RISE UP!
RISE UP! RISE UP!
[ARMSTRONG LAUGHS]
